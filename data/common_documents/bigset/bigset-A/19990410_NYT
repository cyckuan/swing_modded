<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. _ Stepping carefully into the debate on
abortion that has roiled her party for years, Elizabeth Dole said
Friday that as a possible Republican Presidential candidate, she
would not be drawn into ``dead-end debates'' over a constitutional
amendment to ban abortion, because ``it's not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to a supporter and a brief exchange with reporters
after a speech here, Mrs. Dole made her most extensive comments on
the subject since she undertook her exploratory campaign last
month. In doing so, she echoed the modulated posture of her party's
other leading contender, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who opposes
abortion but refuses to say whether he would insist that a running
mate share his view.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a divisive and irrelevant debate, in terms of an
amendment,'' Mrs. Dole told reporters after a speech to a
University of Southern California group, made up almost entirely of
women, that raises money for scholarship funds. During the speech
Mrs. Dole made no mention of the abortion issue, long a staple of
the Republican Party platform.
</P>
<P>
   The very way in which Mrs. Dole chose to address the issue
showed her trepidation about addressing it.
</P>
<P>
   She made her remarks first only in writing, in a letter to Sandy
Cowen-Miller of Phoenix, a supporter who was at a meeting in
Arizona last week in which another woman asked Mrs. Dole how
Republicans ``can preserve our ideals and our party, too.'' In the
letter, Mrs. Dole said she opposed abortion, except in cases of
rape or incest, or to save the life of the mother.
</P>
<P>
   But she also noted in the letter that Congress had not voted on
a constitutional amendment to outlaw abortion in 15 years, and
added: ``Republican women can set the example. We can refuse to be
drawn into dead-end debates. We can concentrate instead on what we
agree upon most: we can stop partial-birth abortions, enact
parental notification requirements, continue the ban on government
funding and do everything possible to place unwanted babies with
adoptive parents who will love and care for them.''
</P>
<P>
   She blamed the press for placing ``such an inordinate focus on
an amendment that urgent issues such as domestic violence, child
care, sexual harassment, women's health and the financial security
of women are nearly ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the speech Mrs. Dole's aides called reporters, saying she
would release the letter and hold a rare question-and-answer
session about it. But after the speech, Mrs. Dole declined to
elaborate much, saying only that the party's platform should be
modified to ``add the fact that good and honorable people disagree
on the subject of abortion,'' and that ``we should agree to
respectfully disagree.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has drawn fire from both supporters and opponents of
abortion for his attempt to bridge such divisions, and Mrs. Dole
drew similarly sharp responses Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's called presidential courage,'' said Kate Michelman,
head of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action
League, which has run television commercials here and in New
Hampshire and Iowa branding Mrs. Dole as ``anti-choice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What she clearly is trying to do is have it both ways,'' Ms.
Michelman added. ``She clearly has reiterated her opposition to a
woman's right to choose, and at the same time, she's saying to the
American public, `But don't worry, because I won't support a
constitutional amendment.' Well, the American people don't want
that in their leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Goeglein, a spokesman for another prospective Republican
candidate, Gary Bauer, welcomed Mrs. Dole's emphasis on the ``need
to change hearts and minds in the country,'' but said that was not
enough. ``We should also be actively pursuing a legislative agenda,
and obviously the Republican Party platform reflects that, and Gary
would be categorically opposed to changing the platform.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Dole said, ``What I'm doing is really reflecting what
I'm seeing all around the country,'' in terms of uneasiness and
worry about internal divisions in the party. She added: ``For me,
there's no question in my mind that people want to see us move
forward and accomplish some good things, not just kind of endlessly
debate something that really is not going anywhere. It's not going
to happen.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Four days after NATO approved the deployment of two
dozen American Apache helicopter gunships to attack Yugoslav tanks,
frustrated NATO and Pentagon officials now estimate that it could
take a month before the helicopters are available to fly into
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. C-17 cargo planes carrying the first loads of equipment and
supplies to support the Apaches began arriving in Albania's
capital, Tirana, over the last two days. But officials said the
full deployment had moved sluggishly, and they cited bad weather,
slow-moving bureaucracy and an air-traffic bottleneck over Albania
because of the airlift of food and relief supplies.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's senior military commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, has
expressed aggravation at the delays of the Apaches, which are
suited to seek out and destroy tanks and other armored vehicles
involved in the attacks on Kosovo's ethnic Albanians. A NATO
official said Clark on Friday scolded officials organizing the
airlift into Albania, ordering them to do more to speed the
deployment.
</P>
<P>
   When NATO authorized the use of the Apaches on Monday, officials
said it would take only seven to 10 days to have them ready for
their combat missions.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance has also come under criticism for not moving fast
enough to protect the hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians
that it says are now living in the open in Kosovo under threat of
attack from Yugoslav forces and with little food and water.
</P>
<P>
   Although NATO has reported making progress against Yugoslavia's
military and police forces, bad weather has once again enveloped
the Balkans, limiting the alliance's attacks to cruise missiles and
high-flying warplanes, like the B-2 bombers. The skies over
Belgrade were overcast all day, with the clouds dipping as low as
1,500 feet at times.
</P>
<P>
   The Apaches can fly effectively in any weather and, officials
said, could be put to good use against Yugoslav forces in what are
now lulls in NATO's raids.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's attacks resumed for a 17th day Friday, relying
heavily on cruise missiles, officials said. Five explosions were
reported Friday evening in Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital. The
official Yugoslav news agency reported that a television
transmitter had been hit on Mount Goles near Kosovo's provincial
capital, Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   The latest attacks came hours after President Slobodan Milosevic
of Yugoslavia rejected an effort by a Cypriote official, Spyros
Kyprianou, to secure the release of three U.S. soldiers who were
captured along the Yugoslav-Macedonian border on March 31.
Kyprianou said Milosevic had ruled out ``any peaceful gestures''
because of the intensification of NATO's bombing in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen ordered still more U.S.
forces to join in a NATO force that has already grown significantly
since the strikes began on March 24. Cohen sent six more F-15C
fighter jets now based in Alaska to the region and ordered a Navy
minesweeper, the Inchon, to stay in the Adriatic rather than leave
as scheduled for the Persian Gulf. The Inchon has helicopters
aboard that could be used in the relief operation.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said Cohen now had an
official request from Clark for dozens of additional fighter and
support aircraft, including more fighters like the F-16, the F-15
and the A-10, which is designed to fly low and attack ground troops
and armor, and refueling aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional pressure on the Clinton administration also
continued to grow. A bipartisan group of senators and
representatives who traveled to NATO's headquarters with Cohen this
week sent President Clinton a letter, urging him to do more to at
least plan for the use of ground forces and to prepare the American
public for a long campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even assuming the success of the air campaign to significantly
degrade Milosevic's military capability, there is less certainty
that NATO's broader objectives in Kosovo (removal of Milosevic's
troops and return of refugees with international protection) will
be achieved,'' the group of nine Republicans and Democrats wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Before the rain and clouds set in again, U.S. and other NATO
warplanes had for the first time begun to strike armored forces
operating in Kosovo. And on Thursday the Pentagon said the strikes
had effectively cut the fuel and ammunition lines to the
40,000-strong Yugoslav army and to police units in the province.
</P>
<P>
   But officials concede that they have so far done little to
destroy the front-line armored forces accused of carrying out the
worst of the attacks in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clark had requested the deployment of the Apache helicopters _
along with long-range rocket batteries used to back them up _ more
than two weeks ago to accelerate that effort. But carrying out his
request initially stalled because of concerns about putting ground
forces so close to the fighting in Yugoslavia, and now because of
the sluggish deployment.
</P>
<P>
   Officials now concede officially that the schedule of putting
Apaches in place in seven to 10 days has slipped. Maj. Gen. Charles
Wald, the deputy director of strategic plans and policy for the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Friday that it was unlikely that even
an ``initial operational capability'' would be in place before
seven days.
</P>
<P>
   A major factor in the delay has been the small and underequipped
airport outside Tirana, which has been overwhelmed by the enormous
effort to ship food and other supplies to more than 200,000 ethnic
Albanian refugees who fled Yugoslav forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has already shipped 230,000 daily rations,
100,000 gallons of water and 700 tents to Albania and has plans for
still more shipments in the days and weeks ahead.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Defense Department official in Washington said NATO's
focus on the relief effort in Albania had slowed the effort to move
the Apache unit there. ``If we wanted them in quickly, it wouldn't
take long to get them in,'' the official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity. `It's a question of priorities.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Other officials have said that even if the Apaches arrived soon,
Yugoslavia's air defense system was still formidable enough to make
flying the helicopters risky. Clark has indicated that the Apaches
would join the fight right away, but other Pentagon officials would
prefer to use the Apaches only after the air defenses are further
weakened.
</P>
<P>
   Wald said the Air Force had sent a team of experts to Tirana's
airport to install a lighting system and air-traffic control
equipment that could allow landings and takeoffs at night; they are
now limited to daylight.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time it will be easier to bring more equipment in,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the weather over the Balkans has been so bad that it has
delayed the installation and testing of that equipment, which is
not expected to be in place before the end of the weekend. The
weather has also delayed some of the cargo flights from Germany,
where the Apaches and related forces are based.
</P>
<P>
   Only four of five C-17 flights scheduled to fly to Albania on
Thursday made it through the clouds and rain, while the other had
to cancel its flight. Friday, only five of seven were able to land,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Another senior defense official said that if the airport
operated 24 hours a day and was not hampered by the weather, the
full force could arrive within 16 days. At the current pace,
however, the estimate is that 25 more days will be needed, meaning
it will be May 2 when the full force is there.
</P>
<P>
   This official and others said another problem was the ``weight''
of the Army's force. Although the Apaches themselves are expected
to fly to Albania, the rocket batteries, armored vehicles and other
equipment to set up a secure base for 2,800 soldiers will require
some 150 cargo flights from Germany to Albania.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the Army is sending the force into remote, rugged
terrain in Europe's poorest country means that the force must bring
with it everything the soldiers need to live and work. ``It's not
like taking an airplane and landing at Aviano,'' the senior defense
official said, referring to the air base in Italy that is the nexus
of NATO's attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Apaches, along with the long-range rocket batteries, will
ultimately set up a base at an airfield now being carved out of a
pasture in an undisclosed location between Tirana and Albania's
northern border with Kosovo. The helicopters are likely to operate
in smaller groups from hidden bases in the mountains and forests
close to Kosovo's border.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, in a television interview from NATO's headquarters in
Brussels, Belgium, said Friday that the Apaches would allow NATO to
``work beneath the weather'' when rain and clouds scuttle other
flights.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance confirmed Friday that one of three bombs aimed
earlier this week at the main telephone exchange in Pristina had
missed its target and slammed into a residential area, although it
was unclear if anyone had died as a result. The Yugoslav
authorities say 10 people were killed when an errant bomb hit the
city on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``One bomb appeared to be seduced off the target at the final
stages,'' said NATO's military spokesman, Air Commodore David Wilby
of Britain. ``Close inspection of imagery indicates that it landed
some 200 to 300 meters away in what seems to be a small residential
area.'' He said the telephone exchange was a ``critical target''
since it was used for communications between Belgrade and Serbian
forces in Kosovo. He said NATO regretted any possible loss of
civilian life as a result of the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes Friday night hit a sprawling industrial complex in
Kragujevac that included the country's only auto plant. Pentagon
and NATO officials said the factory also made military vehicles and
was thus a legitimate military target.

ADS ON THE RISE AT DODGER STADIUM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Not long ago, pitching at Dodger Stadium occurred
only between the mound and home plate, except for orange Unocal
balls atop the outfield pavilions. Now commercialism has spread
through the ballpark, one of the final holdouts of a baseball
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   What in the name of Sandy Koufax is going on? older fans may be
asking, particularly since the Dodgers are one of the most
influential names in sports. As in most enterprises, the answer
comes down to the bottom line, and the Dodgers, with the second
biggest payroll in baseball, are obviously trying to recover some
of that cash. Like the cool $105million they are spending on
pitcher Kevin Brown over the next seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Though not overwhelming, the roster of advertising at the
37-year-old park more than doubled this season with a trio of ads
(Dodge, Bud Lite and Pacific Bell) adorning the outfield fence,
logos in both dugouts (New Era athletic uniforms), one in the
visitor's bullpen (MasterCard) and several along the foul lines,
including one for the Department of Water and Power.
</P>
<P>
   The incursion began in earnest last year with rotating
advertisements behind home plate. Industry observers believe the
ads _ nearly all at field level _ are aimed as much at the millions
watching at home on television as fans at the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a scale of 1 to 10 compared to other teams, the Dodgers are
probably a 3 right now,'' said Dean Bonham, head of a Denver-based
sports consulting firm. ``But I would imagine they'll be a 7 or 8
in a few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the ads, particularly those in the outfield, have
been designed to blend with the overall decor, they are surely
something of a jolt to fans who recall the four decades of the
O'Malley family's ownership prior to Rupert Murdoch's takeover last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dodgers have done a pretty good job of phasing in
advertising tastefully because the ads are much less invasive than
they could be,'' said sports consultant and USC marketing professor
David Carter. ``And I think they are first and foremost for the TV
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Stockhamer, the team's vice president of marketing, said
response to the new ads has been minimal. ``There's really been
very little reaction,'' he noted. ``We think Dodger Stadium has
less ad signage than almost any other sports facility. We've also
tried to make the signage blend in with the aesthetic of the
park.''
</P>
<P>
   Other teams have been far more aggressive in recent years. For
example, The Gap chain now has ads on the left-center and
right-center ``gaps'' on outfield fences at eight Major League
parks.
</P>
<P>
   Stockhamer said Dodger management recognizes the increased ads
represent a significant break with tradition. ``We're trying to be
thoughtful about this,'' he added. ``It's very important to us that
the sponsors be involved in our community activities. So you can't
just go out and buy a sign at Dodger Stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he noted, Pacific Bell has teamed with the Dodgers
on a program to encourage reading among children, while the Los
Angeles Department of Water and Power has backed the new Dodger
Experience museum area, which is free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said he was especially impressed with the Dodger
Experience. ``It's a great way for them to link the past with the
present and shows the appreciation for what the Dodgers mean to
baseball,'' he added. ``They are not forgetting that connection,
although I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that they are selling
merchandise there.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stockhamer also admitted that the realities of supporting a
roster with a $79 million payroll, trailing only the New York
Yankees, also played a role in the new ads appearing. ``There are
only so many revenue streams that a club has,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bonham said the Dodgers appear to have recognized that they need
to take a go-slow approach. ``The Dodgers fans are fairly
conservative when it comes to commercialization, and I think the
management is sensitive to that,'' he said. ``But to survive, the
team has to squeeze every last dollar. So over the long term, the
Dodgers are not going to be any different from other teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter believes the Dodgers were already moving toward ads in
the outfield last year when they posted murals of past Dodger
greats on the walls. ``I think they were trying to prepare people
to focus on the wall because there was going to be advertising at
some point,'' he said. ``And if they win the pennant this year, the
fans' tolerance for advertising will increase.''
</P>
<P>
   More advertising is clearly the direction for the entire game. A
few weeks ago, reports emerged that Major League Baseball was
considering the idea of allowing advertising on players' uniforms,
much like professional soccer teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think uniform ads are inevitable as one more strategy to
generate revenues and solve the disparity between large-market and
small-market teams,'' Bonham said. ``I would suggest we're going to
see corporate names on uniforms. It's something we need to get used
to.''

McCARRON IS BETTER THAN `LESSER-KNOWN' 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ At 22, it was clear to Scott McCarron that he
wasn't good enough to be a professional golfer. Eleven years later,
the former UCLA Bruin has put himself in a position to win golf's
first (and in the eyes of many, foremost) major.
</P>
<P>
   McCarron sits alone in second at the halfway point of the
Masters, one shot behind Jose Marie Olazabal and his 8-under-par
136.
</P>
<P>
   The low 12 golfers after the first two rounds include 10 players
with at least one major title to their name and two
``lesser-knowns,'' as one writer delicately described McCarron and
Brandel Chamblee to McCarron's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider myself a lesser-known,'' said McCarron, who
carded a 4-under-par 68 to go along with his opening 69. ``When I'm
playing with (Greg) Norman or (Fred) Couples, I feel I'm as good as
them. You have to believe that or you don't belong out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest anyone continued to doubt his credentials, McCarron rattled
them off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finished 10th at Augusta (in 1996), I finished 10th at the
U.S. Open (in 1997), I finished 10th at the PGA Championship (also
in 1997).''
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a guy who considered himself washed up as a golfer
in 1988. That was the year he graduated from UCLA, put to rest his
dream of becoming a pro and went into the apparel business with his
father in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   It was three years before he picked up a long putter and revived
his dream. He played on the Canadian tour for a year, qualified for
the PGA Tour in 1994 and since has won twice, in New Orleans and
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I actually was a pretty good player in college,'' McCarron
said. ``Maybe my heart just wasn't in it.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarron walked away from UCLA with a degree in history and a
friend for life in fellow golfer Brandt Jobe. Jobe was McCarron's
fraternity brother and the best man at his wedding, so it figures
there wouldn't be much separating the two at an event as momentous
as this.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, six strokes is all that stands between them. Jobe,
who is making his first Masters appearance, is at 143 after
shooting 72-71.
</P>
<P>
   ``For him and I to sit here, two college drinking buddies, and
walk down the fairways of Augusta, it's quite a thrill for both of
us,'' McCarron said.
</P>
<P>
   Great groove: &UR;  &LR; No one this week has needed fewer strokes to get
around the front nine than Jay Haas did Friday. He made the turn in
4-under-par 32.
</P>
<P>
   His round started inauspiciously, with a bogey 5 at No.1.
</P>
<P>
   But Haas, who has one of his sons carrying his bag this week,
rebounded with a birdie at No. 2 and then got into a glorious
groove, birdieing holes 6, 7, 8 and 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get back into the tournament and I feel like I did
today,'' said Haas, who opened with a 2-over 74.
</P>
<P>
   Haas fell off his torrid pace a tad down the stretch, giving
back one stroke to card a 3-under 69 for the day.
</P>
<P>
   It has been that kind of week for Haas at Augusta National; he
has played the first nine holes in 5 under par and the the back
nine in 4 over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just not playing the back nine very well,'' Haas said.
``No explanation other than I'm not hitting shots at the right
time.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Haas' 18th appearance here. His 69 was his best
accounting at Augusta National since his 64 in the second round in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Faldo's failings: &UR;  &LR; Nick Faldo has his own golf institute in
Orlando. He might want to consider taking his name off the
masthead, if only temporarily. His play of late hasn't exactly
provided a ringing endorsement for the school.
</P>
<P>
   Faldo, a three-time Masters champion, followed an opening-round
80 with a 1-over 73 to miss his third straight Masters cut. The
last time he played here over the weekend was in 1996, when he
breezed to a win on the wings of Greg Norman's collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Faldo has won just once on the PGA Tour (in L.A., in
1997). He hasn't had a top-10 finish in a major since his
fourth-place showing at the 1996 British Open and he has gone a
year-and-a-half without a top-10 finish on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fine line at the moment, isn't it?'' said Faldo, who
pronounced his game fairly sound technically even if he doesn't
have much to show for it in the way of results.
</P>
<P>
   Immelman with Singh: &UR;  &LR; Nineteen-year old amateur Trevor Immelman
made the cut with a two-day total of plus-4, helping his cause
considerably with a 4-under showing on the par-5s.
</P>
<P>
   Immelman will be paired today with Vijay Singh, the winner of
the last major of 1998 (the PGA Championship). Singh stuck around
for the weekend, no thanks to his putter. He had 31 putts on
Thursday and 37 on Friday on his way to a two-day total of
4-over-par 148.
</P>
<P>
   ``My putting is awful right now,'' he conceded. ``I feel like
I'm going to make everything when I stand over (the putts). But I'm
always worried about where the ball could end up if I don't stroke
it just right and that makes me very defensive. If I can conquer
that, I'll be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Also: &UR;  &LR; LPGA star Helen Alfredsson is here this week, doing
commentary for Swedish television. She has played the course once,
carding a 78.... In 1998 only seven players survived the cut in all
four majors. They were Tiger Woods, Fred Couples, Brad Faxon, John
Huston, Mark O'Meara, Ernie Els and Phil Mickelson. Each gave
himself a chance to repeat the feat this year by qualifying to play
the final two rounds here.

HARPER GETS A BREAK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ His minutes are declining, but don't mistake
that for a decline in Derek Harper's stamina or ability. The
16-year veteran says he's just fine, though his coach admits he's
happy to give the 37-year-old a rest.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Lakers' starting point guard played a season-low
17 minutes Tuesday against Utah, as rookie Tyronn Lue got hot in
his debut and played most of the game. The next night at
Sacramento, Harper played a new season-low 13 minutes, as backup
Derek Fisher got in a groove.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Kurt Rambis said it's no reflection on Harper, who's
averaging 7.5 points and 4.5 assists in 26.3 minutes per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never intended to play Derek Harper that many minutes to
begin with,'' Rambis said. ``He was brought in as a veteran backup
point guard, and that was our initial intention for him. He just
played so phenomenally well, that he deserved more minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to see what Ty could do and the possibilities he
could bring to a ball club. And in Sacramento, Fisher played very
well, and I've been very consistent in that if an individual or a
unit goes well, they stay in the game and get more time.''
</P>
<P>
   And Harper's not complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're called upon to play, you play, and when you're
not, you just sit and support the people that are playing,'' he
said. ``This is my 16th year in the league, so I don't ever
question that kind of stuff.... I'm past that in my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite playing several 25- to 30-minute games, Harper said he
feels ``good physically.... Age is overrated, man.'' Yet his
production is also down _ he's shooting 28.2 percent (11 for 39)
over his past seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Harper welcomes the rest, and Rambis admits his heavy minutes
are a concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I look at the stats sheet,'' he said. ``I know what
it's like to play when you're that old. It takes its toll on you.
When you start playing back-to-backs, your body takes a beating....
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a very good scenario for us, to get him as much
rest as possible going into the playoffs. We know what he can do,
we know he can step it up in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Model citizen: Dennis Rodman still picks up technical fouls at a
pace just slightly beneath his rebounding rate, but he has
otherwise been on his best behavior for the past two weeks _ since
the day he ditched practice.
</P>
<P>
   Rambis had a 30-minute hear-to-heart with Rodman that day and
said afterward that Rodman had agreed to be more a part of the team
for the rest of the season. So far, so good.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been on time for everything. He's done everything that we
wanted him to do,'' Rambis said. ``I have absolutely zero
complaints with him.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rodman has made his presence felt as much as his absences
were.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's talking more, he's communicating more, especially on the
court and in the locker room,'' Harper said. ``I think it's helping
us, especially from a defensive standpoint, because that's where
most of his communication is coming from ... Dennis has been very
positive.''

LOS ANGELES POLICE OFFER SUPPORT FOR POW's MOTHER 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Just hours after Vivian Ramirez learned efforts to
free her POW son Staff Sgt. Andrew Ramirez had failed Friday, she
accepted solace and encouragement from Los Angeles police officers.
</P>
<P>
   During an emotional ceremony at Parker Center, Ramirez and her
other son, Los Angeles police Detective Steven Ramirez, were given
posters bearing Andrew's picture under the heading ``Our American
Hero'' and signed by officers from the 18 police divisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost feel on top of the world. I will feel on top of the
world when my son comes home,'' Vivian Ramirez said, trying to hold
back tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry; it's been a trying day today not hearing any
news.''
</P>
<P>
   After receiving the posters, Steven Ramirez, a detective in the
Van Nuys Division, also offered his appreciation to his colleagues
for their support.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, soon he will be home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd first like to thank everybody. I'd especially like to
thank the people of the city of Los Angeles and the Los Angeles
Police Department, especially the wonderful people at Van Nuys.''
</P>
<P>
   The presentation to the family was made to show the support the
LAPD has for its members and their family, Police Chief Bernard C.
Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been trying to figure out what we could do to show our
support,'' Parks said. ``We thought of wearing yellow ribbons, but
then decided to show all the support that Andrew has.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ramirez's East Los Angeles neighborhood, other family
members, friends and relatives said they were disappointed but not
surprised that the three U.S. POWs captured by Serbian forces
remained in custody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wish that they would show him again to make sure he is
OK. I think the whole world is wishing that,'' said Olivia
Rodriguez, Andrew Ramirez's cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rodriguez maintained that the NATO airstrikes should not
halt. Oscar Rios, a friend and neighbor of Ramirez's, sees it
differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm upset myself. They're playing games with the U.S. If I was
the president, I'd stop bombing and then get them out _ and then
start bombing again,'' the 45-year-old Rios said.
</P>
<P>
   Another neighbor, Mike Lara, said he anticipated the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's any surprise. This guy doesn't have any
compassion for human rights, so why would he be any different with
the family or the POWs? It's his ace on the table, and he's going
to play it,'' Lara said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it comes as a surprise to anybody. We're bombing
his country and he's going to let go of some prisoners that he
captured? I don't think so. It was too good to be true,'' Lara
added.
</P>
<P>
   Another Ramirez cousin, John Hernandez, 20, who lives two doors
down from Andrew Ramirez's father's home, was more optimistic that
the men will be released.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just really worried right now. We don't know what's
going to happen. We thought we had a chance. We thought he'd come
home. We thought everything was going to go OK.''

`OUT OF THE CHANNEL' A PAINFUL LOOK BACK AT SPILL 
</HEADLINE>
 EDS: RESENDING TO CORRECT BYLINE   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Anybody who loves the marine environments and maritime
communities of the Pacific Coast should, albeit with a bit of pain,
read John Keeble's ``Out of the Channel: The Exxon-Valdez Oil Spill
in Prince William Sound.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is an investigative work, as well as a personal memoir,
of the greatest environmental disaster to hit the United States,
and of its yet-to-end aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Originally issued after the spill, ``Out of the Channel'' has
been updated to show how the spill set off a succession of
discouraging events. They include the high death rates in a killer
whale pod that resides in the pristine environment fouled by the
spill, the destructive clearcutting of forests by cash-strapped
native corporations, and a back-door deal between Exxon and a group
of seven Seattle-based seafood processors.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon quietly paid out a $70 million settlement for fishing
losses to the ``Seattle Seven.'' Secretly, however, the processors
agreed to apply for their share of any punitive damages awarded to
fishermen suing the oil giant. They would then hand the money back
to Exxon.
</P>
<P>
   A writing professor at Eastern Washington University, Keeble has
an eye for characters. Several are from the village of Cordova,
Alaska, whose fishermen fought against construction of the
Trans-Alaska Pipeline and warned that the Alyeska Pipeline Co. was
not prepared to deal with a spill.
</P>
<P>
   He relates a memorable prediction, delivered by phone to a
meeting in Valdez just six hours before the Exxon-Valdez went
aground on Bligh Reef. It came from Dr. Riki Ott, a marine
biologist and Cordova-based gillnetter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the high frequency of tankers into Port Valdez, the
increasing age and size of the tanker fleet, and the inability to
quickly contain and clean up an oil spill in the open water of
Alaska, fishermen feel that we are playing a game of Russian
roulette,'' Ott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When, not if, The Big One does occur and much or all of the
income from a fishing season is lost, compensation for processors,
support industries and local communities will be difficult if not
impossible to obtain,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The prediction has proven remarkably accurate. Exxon has used a
multiplicity of appeals to avoid paying a $5.3 billion civil
judgment awarded in 1994 by an Anchorage jury. In Cordova, the
largest cannery has closed. The value of a fishing license is
perhaps one-tenth of what it was before the spill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of the Channel'' is not a book of stereotypes. Keeble is
sympathetic to Capt. Joe Hazelwood, depicted as a drunken
ne'er-do-well even though he wasn't on the bridge at the time of
the accident. Keeble is scathing toward the U.S. Coast Guard for
its haphazard tracking of tankers and can't-happen-here attitude.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, Exxon has cleverly cut its losses from the '89
disaster. Its scientists claim that Prince William Sound has
completely recovered. Oil company apologists in the media have
taken to beating up Cordova, claiming the fishing village is
inhabited by people with nothing to do in the winter but watch
television and endlessly complain.
</P>
<P>
   Keeble presents a far truer picture. His Cordova is a town that
refuses to let Prince William Sound become the petroleum industry's
Potemkin Village, and dares to assert that a multinational company
must pay for the damage it did to a once-vibrant economy.

RANGERS LOSE AS BURKETT'S STRETCH WOES CONTINUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Rangers right-hander John Burkett suffers
from a baseball version of multiple-personality disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Suggested title for his biography: ``Dr. Windup, Mr. Stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Burkett once again demonstrated an inability to pitch from the
stretch with runners aboard, and that flaw reared its ugly head
during last night's 8-4 defeat to the Anaheim Angels at The
Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett surrendered three hits to the Angels during six at-bats
with runners aboard, and the final two resulted in four runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went out there feeling like I didn't have any weapons,''
Burkett said, ``and it showed.''
</P>
<P>
   The show didn't last long.
</P>
<P>
   Angels third baseman Troy Glaus delivered the knockout punch
with a two-out, two-run double during the third inning. Glaus
deposited a 3-2 curveball into the gap in left-center field that
scored Randy Velarde and Darin Erstad and provided the Angels a 5-1
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett, though, viewed the pitch prior to that as the turning
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where I've got to make my pitch,'' said Burkett, who
surrendered five runs on seven hits. ``If I make that pitch, I'm
out of the inning and maybe I can grind it out like \RAnaheim
left-hander Chuck\S Finley did. He didn't have his best stuff
either, but he was able to grind it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Burkett's 2-2 fastball, though, eluded the strike zone by the
narrowest of margins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was off the plate,'' Burkett said. ``I think Pudge made it
look good, but it was off the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   What made matters worse, Burkett said, was that Glaus appeared
to be looking for a breaking ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was frozen. I think I could have thrown it right down the
middle and he would have taken it,'' Burkett said. ``Now, you've
got to make another pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   The inability to pitch effectively from the stretch haunted
Burkett all last season. Opponents hit only .254 against the
right-hander with no one on base, but Burkett surrendered a .347
batting average with runners aboard. That ranked as the fifth-worst
figure among American League pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Designated hitter Todd Greene found Burkett's delivery from the
stretch inviting, as well. Greene followed Glaus' second-inning
single with a two-run homer on a first-pitch slider that gave the
Angels a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett worked extensively this spring on his mechanics from the
stretch and remains convinced that improvement will be forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I made progress,'' Burkett said. ``I still believe
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers rallied throughout the evening, and a fifth-inning,
solo home run by catcher Ivan Rodriguez off Finley pulled the
Rangers within one run at 5-4. Right-hander Esteban Loaiza, who
replaced Burkett, gave the Rangers that opportunity by retiring 10
of the first 11 batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, though, struck for three runs during the seventh
inning against Loaiza, whose 4 1/3-inning appearance marked the
second-longest relief appearance of his career. Tim Salmon's
two-out, two-run home run proved to be the final straw and gave the
Angels an 8-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't tired,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said. ``He was
throwing 95 and getting good hitters out. He made one bad pitch to
Salmon, and that was it.''

   What made matters worse, Burkett said, was that Glaus appeared
to be looking for a breaking ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was frozen. I think I could have thrown it right down the
middle and he would have taken it,'' Burkett said. ``Now, you've
got to make another pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   The inability to pitch effectively from the stretch haunted
Burkett all last season. Opponents hit only .254 against the
right-hander with no one on base, but Burkett surrendered a .347
batting average with runners aboard. That ranked as the fifth-worst
figure among American League pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Designated hitter Todd Greene found Burkett's delivery from the
stretch inviting, as well. Greene followed Glaus' second-inning
single with a two-run homer on a first-pitch slider that gave the
Angels a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett worked extensively this spring on his mechanics from the
stretch and remains convinced that improvement will be forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I made progress,'' Burkett said. ``I still believe
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers rallied throughout the evening, and a fifth-inning,
solo home run by catcher Ivan Rodriguez off Finley pulled the
Rangers within one run at 5-4. Right-hander Esteban Loaiza, who
replaced Burkett, gave the Rangers that opportunity by retiring 10
of the first 11 batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, though, struck for three runs during the seventh
inning against Loaiza, whose 4 1/3-inning appearance marked the
second-longest relief appearance of his career. Tim Salmon's
two-out, two-run home run proved to be the final straw and gave the
Angels an 8-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't tired,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said. ``He was
throwing 95 and getting good hitters out. He made one bad pitch to
Salmon, and that was it.''

ON BOWLING NIGHT, RANGERS HAVE FEW STRIKES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ It was unofficially Bowling Night at The
Ballpark in Arlington last night, which means:
</P>
<P>
   (a) We should have all gone bowling instead.
</P>
<P>
   (b) Hanging sliders from Ranger pitchers looked as big as
bowling balls to the visiting Angels' hitters.
</P>
<P>
   (c) Starter John Burkett rolled at least two too many
gutterballs.
</P>
<P>
   (d) We should have stayed home and rented a tape of Dudley
Moore's ``Arthur'', which featured the greatest bowling line ever
from the late John Gielgud, who told Liza Minnelli in his
wonderfully stuffy English accent: ``Normally one would have to go
to a bowling alley to meet a girl like you.''
</P>
<P>
   (e) All of the above.
</P>
<P>
   Hint: Take (e).
</P>
<P>
   All of this, sadly, leads us back to that sorest and sorriest of
subjects, Rangers' pitching, or lack thereof.
</P>
<P>
   There are far too many nights when trying to win with this staff
is like trying to make the 7-10 split. This was another of them.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett, who has been known to roll a perfect 300-game or two on
the hardwood, served up a home run to the game's first batter _
sound familiar? _ and a two-run homer to Todd Greene an inning
later.
</P>
<P>
   It was like throwing gutterballs in the first two frames, and
the Angels opened a four-game series between the two AL West
archrivals with an 8-4 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Good thing they didn't bring their ``A'' team.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn, back in California with an ankle sprain and watching
on TV, probably took a look at the watermelons Burkett was lobbing
up to the plate and grabbed a bat in his living room.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have played four games, won one of them a 6-0
victory behind Aaron Sele, but have given up a whopping 26 runs in
the other three. That's 6.5 per game, even with the shutout, and
that simply won't do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played only four games,'' manager Johnny Oates stressed
to us doom sayers who keep harping on this subject. ``What we have
to do is, the night we give up eight, score 10. No, we can't keep
giving up eight runs a game, but we don't have to throw shutouts
either. We need to be somewhere in between.
</P>
<P>
   ``If, at the end of 50 games, it's still at 6 1/2 \Rruns\S,
that's when you send up the flag. But it won't be.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so the sample is minuscule at this point, but the evidence
to date certainly looks damning.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Palmeiro's home run in the first was the first of his
career. Yes, even banjo hitters are now finding the range to the
most distant points of Home Run Porch.
</P>
<P>
   Greene's more damaging two-run shot in the second was a laser
beam to straightaway center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burkie struggled with his command,'' Oates said. ``Almost
every hit he gave up was on a hanging breaking ball.''
</P>
<P>
   When Todd Zeile's bases-empty homer cut it to 3-1 in the bottom
of the inning, Burkett hurried back out to the mound in the top of
the third and gave up singles to Randy Velarde and Darin Erstad
before hanging another lollipop down the middle for Troy Glaus. The
Angels' third baseman banged it off the top of the left-field wall
for a two-run double that mercifully sent Burkett to the showers.
</P>
<P>
   The most encouraging stretch of the night for the Rangers was
the 3 1/3 innings of shutout relief from previously scorched
Esteban Loaiza from the third through the sixth. Unfortunately,
even that was spoiled by Oates' questionable decision to stay with
him when he ran into trouble in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had cut Anaheim's lead to a run while Loaiza held
the Angels in check. But a leadoff single, a sacrifice bunt and a
run-scoring double by Randy Velarde made it 6-4 and left the fans
uneasy with the middle of the Angels' order due at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Oates could have brought in left-hander Mike Munoz to face
lefty-swinging Erstad, but elected to stay with the laboring
Loaiza. Zeile's diving stop robbed Erstad of a hit, but that was
only a temporary reprieve. Loaiza dropped down sidearm in an
attempt to gun a 2-2 fastball past Tim Salmon, left the pitch up
and down the middle, and Salmon was on it like a shark on a wounded
gamefish. The two-run homer broke the Rangers' (come)backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have brought in Munoz, but Loaiza was still throwing
well and he wasn't tired,'' Oates said, defending his decision.
``He's gone longer than that several times this spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Not, however, without getting bombed, which is why it might have
been nice to get him out after a successful outing.
</P>
<P>
   Oh well. Maybe next time they'll give away bowling shirts.

MOVIE TICKET PRICE HITS $8.50
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The $10 movie ticket looks more and more
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, AMC became the first chain in Los Angeles to reach
the $8.50 milestone for movie tickets, jumping over the $8.25 price
at several Cineplex locations with a 75-cent boost at four of its
top locations. Most other local chains held to $7.50 and $8,
although Mann Theaters -- with no fanfare whatsoever -- hit $8.50
last week at its flagship Chinese Theatre in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   AMC's move was far more sweeping, amounting to a 10 percent hike
at 57 of its top-grossing auditoriums. It imposed the new admission
prices for adult customers after 6 p.m. at the Promenade 16 in
Woodland Hills, the Santa Monica 7, the Century 14 in Century City
and the Rolling Hills 20 in Torrance.
</P>
<P>
   AMC, of Kansas City, Mo., also hiked prices to $8.50 at several
other top-grossing theaters in San Diego and Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our normal course of business,'' said AMC spokeswoman
Brenda Nolte. ``We review prices every few months and determine the
level for each theater on a market-by-market basis. We only went to
$8.50 at some of our trophy properties where we have outstanding
amenities.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles prices still lag well behind the top price in the
nation: $9.50 per ticket at Loews Cineplex Sony Lincoln Square in
Manhattan, following a 50-cent increase in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``Practically speaking, $8.50 would be considered among the
least expensive in Manhattan,'' noted analyst Stewart Halpern of
ING Barings Furman Selz. ``It isn't out of line in the context of
what you see in New York. In an environment in which monthly cable
charges are going up as fast as they are, going out to the movies
is going to look like a bargain.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Laemmle, owner of the Los Angeles-based art-house
specialty chain of the same name, said Friday there were no
immediate plans to boost prices beyond the current $7.50 top.
``We're just watching,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But price hikes will be inevitable, according to entertainment
industry consultant Kevin Skislock of Laguna Research Partners in
Irvine, and could hit $10 soon because of unique pressures faced by
chains.
</P>
<P>
   Theater operators are being squeezed on two fronts -- they face
a continued need to open expensive state-of-the-art megaplexes but
have been unable to negotiate better terms on dividing box office
revenues with studios in the crucial early weeks, when studios
receive most of the split.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exhibitors are in a very tough spot right now,'' Skislock
said. ``They've made a very major investment in plant and
equipment, which means that more people are seeing movies early on,
where the payout is higher for studios. But the studios have been
very reluctant to change the split with exhibitors, so the chains
are going to be getting more aggressive on pricing.''
</P>
<P>
   AMC warned last month that earnings for its fourth-quarter ended
March 31 would be lower than expected, and analysts have projected
a loss of $14 million for the period, more than triple the
year-earlier period. Its shares have been down about 25 percent in
recent weeks from its 1999 high, although the issue rose 56.25
cents to $15.4375 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Movie-ticket prices have generally not posted the same
acceleration as tickets for sporting events and concerts over the
past decade, with the top Southern California price rising only a
dollar in the last nine years. ``The price increases tend to happen
in little spurts,'' noted Jim Kozak, spokesman for the National
Association of Theater Owners.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the average ticket -- which includes all discount
prices -- went up a mere 11 percent between 1990 and last year,
rising from $4.22 to $4.70. Kozak noted that professional
basketball and football tickets jumped more than 50 percent during
the same period, while Halpern asserted that the exhibition
business should have been boosting its prices further in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that part of the motivation of what
they're doing now is to balance higher costs, but the fact remains
that the industry has not been as aggressive as I believe they
should have been,'' Halpern said.
</P>
<P>
   AMC's move is certain to reverberate at Hollywood studios, since
the chain traditionally has not been a leader in raising prices,
Skislock noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``AMC has always aimed to be the king of the midmarket, but
given the huge investment exhibitors made, there is going to be
more of this,'' Skislock said. ``In a noninflationary environment,
people will raise an eyebrow about increased prices and think twice
about it, so impulse moviegoing may decline for a while. This has
got to make Hollywood studios very nervous.''

PATIENTS AS FRAUD POLICE WON'T WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) The federal government and AARP are partnering up in
an enterprise that is probably not in the best interests of
Medicare beneficiaries, those who provide for their health-care
needs, or the political health of the republic.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the concept sounds good, even noble. The idea is to
enlist the 39 million or so Medicare enrollees as an army to fight
fraud and thereby bolster the program's financial health. To this
end, the lobby formerly known as the American Association of
Retired Persons has joined with government in a campaign to recruit
seniors to serve in what amounts to a health-care gestapo.
</P>
<P>
   Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala put it more
delicately when she exhorted beneficiaries, ``We're asking you to
be the eyes and ears of the Medicare program.''
</P>
<P>
   Now what could be wrong with asking Medicare beneficiaries to
police their health-care system for fraud and abuse?
</P>
<P>
   Plenty, actually.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, it replaces trust, the basic cornerstone of
doctor-patient relationships, with distrust. The cornerstone of
this program is the assumption that health-care providers aren't to
be trusted because everyone involved is a potential cheat. Can
anyone believe that turning patients into adversaries will improve
the quality of medicine?
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, asking old people to become snitches robs them of
their dignity. More troubling, perhaps, it empowers those with mean
and vindictive streaks to go out of their way to make trouble for
doctors, nurses, clinics and hospitals they feel haven't treated
them with proper deference or respect. In the wrong hands it can
become a tool of petty vengeance. The program's organizers counsel
restraint and use of proper channels, but this admonition will no
doubt be lost on the mean-spirited.
</P>
<P>
   Thirdly, there is the question of whether encouraging a
vigilante approach is unnecessary overkill. Nancy W. Dickey,
president of the American Medical Association, noted recently that
the physician community has in the main worked cooperatively with
government to reduce fraud and abuse. To this end, she said in a
recent essay in /{The Wall Street Journal/}, the level of Medicare
payments deemed ``improper'' declined by nearly 50 percent from
1996 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   As for estimating the magnitude of fraud, the methodology used
is suspect. The sampling of claims reviewed to screen for improper
payments is so minuscule as to make it statistically irrelevant. An
audit of only 600 Medicare claims, Dickey said, resulted in
government watchdogs claiming $12.6 billion worth of rip-offs last
year.
</P>
<P>
   In a broader political context, this is an approach to
governance that brings out the worst in the American character.
Snitches might be useful in fighting street crime, but transforming
America's senior citizens into a secret police against those trying
to help them puts the nation on a dangerous slippery slope to
despotism.
</P>
<P>
   Government overreaching is perhaps understandable, because this
is the nature of governments, even democratic republics. What's
puzzling is AARP's eagerness to play handmaiden to a police-state
initiative. It probably has something to do with Lord Acton's
observation about how power corrupts.

PROTECTION, KAN., AND Y2K PROTECTION: A MATCH MADE IN CYBERHEAVEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FINN BULLERS and DAVID HAYES  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) Small-town folks in Kansas and computer geeks from
California will hold a hometown barbecue today to celebrate a
strange Y2K kinship that brought together a struggling town and a
start-up online data management firm.
</P>
<P>
   It all started seven months ago with a public relations guy
named Ted Ladd. It was Ladd's job to create a big splash ad
campaign for  &LR; Backup, a 4-year-old San Diego company that earns its
money backing up computer files for homes and small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Ladd envisioned a Times Square or Sunset Strip blitz featuring a
Y2K countdown clock. ``Protect your data before it's too late,''
was the gist of the proposed campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Too costly, his colleagues said.
</P>
<P>
   Why not go the opposite direction? they asked. Put up a
billboard in the middle of nowhere, or better yet adopt a town and
protect every computer file in town from the Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
   So Ladd punched up his favorite Internet search engine looking
for unique names of Midwestern towns under 1,000 people. After
discarding Backup Corner, Pa., and Millennium, N.C., he hit the
mark with Protection, Kan., population 560.
</P>
<P>
   And the more research he did, the better the idea sounded.
</P>
<P>
   History shows that the town, 143 miles south of Wichita along
the Oklahoma border, was established in 1884 at a time when
protectionist policy dominated presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-three years later, the national spotlight hit Protection
when it became the first town in America to be protected against
polio with the Salk vaccine. And today, Ladd said, it will be ``the
only town in America protected from Y2K.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea is simple: Give every computer user in town _ that's
about 250 people _ a $99 online account that will back up their
files at the end of the day on a computer in San Diego. Total
retail value: almost $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   Protection residents invited Ladd and his colleagues into their
homes. The Kansans had heard of Y2K but thought it was only a
big-city worry.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until a year ago when the roof blew off Don's Place on
Main Street and destroyed the restaurant's computer and valuable
files that owner Don Dellinger found out how reliant he had become
on technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all talked about (the Y2K bug), joking about how computers
are going to go down, but not much attention was paid to it,''
Dellinger said over the clatter of the dinner crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the storm brought it to our attention. I had to build my
files from scratch. You're always supposed to back up your computer
files, but who really does?''
</P>
<P>
   Dellinger had to redesign his menus and format new financial
spreadsheets.
</P>
<P>
   For the past week, 25 women have been sprucing up the town for
today's big barbecue. And Dellinger has painted a spare room in his
restaurant to showcase photos of the artwork of Stan Herd, a local
man known the world over for his colorful crop artwork.
</P>
<P>
   Herd, who now lives in Lawrence, Kan., will unveil his latest
creative venture, a 650-foot-long artwork carved out of wheat, the
town's ``stamp of approval'' against Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Business owners Sally Selzer, Orlin Loucks and Danny McLarty
will give tours of their Y2K-ready shops. And computer files at the
town bank, co-op, feed yard and cattle chute manufacturer are safe
from fire, disaster or year 2000 bug.
</P>
<P>
   The adopt-a-town campaign has planted a seed in a town
struggling to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're shrinking like everyone else,'' said Dellinger, who in
the past quarter-century has seen the railroads stop rolling
through his town. ``You lose your school one month and then the
next month this (computer effort) starts up and you remain enthused
about your little community.''
(BULLET)Briday was another day for the Y2K nonrecord book.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some predictions to the contrary _ ``Some fear today is
Y2K doomsday,'' the San Jose Mercury News reported Friday morning _
the 99th day of the year passed without any serious reported Y2K
glitches.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts were concerned that day 99 in year 99 would trip up
computers that counted the date from the first day of the calendar
year, instead of by the month. In some cases, a string of nines was
used by programmers to signal the end of a program, or to tell a
computer to purge information.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's too early to say definitively that there were no
problems Friday, no major outages were reported anywhere in the
U.S. or overseas.
(BULLET)It was more public relations than public preparedness, but
the nation's electric utilities conducted a nationwide Y2K test
Friday to see whether they could communicate if telephone service
goes out.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the test, about 200 utilities across the country
simulated a telecommunications outage that cut off communications
between electric substations, generating plants, other utilities
and the regional power pool.
</P>
<P>
   Employees at the utilities used emergency radios to replace
telephone and computer data systems. The test went off with minor
hitches caused by lightning in some areas, employees who hadn't
been trained on mobile equipment in a few cases, and equipment that
still needs to be fine-tuned, according to the North American
Electric Reliability Council, an industry group that coordinated
the test,
(BULLET)The Federal Aviation Administration, which says it's 88
percent Y2K-ready, will put its money where its computers are late
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA will try the first live test of its Year 2000 air
traffic control computer fixes from the Denver International
Airport control center. The agency plans to split the computers
controlling air traffic around the airport and turn the clock ahead
to Jan. 1, 2000, in half of the systems.
</P>
<P>
   The radar systems will track both commercial flights and an FAA
Lear Jet.
</P>
<P>
   During the four-hour test, technicians will check computer
software changes designed to solve the Y2K problem. The FAA plane
and the small amount of commercial traffic expected during the
midnight hours will be tracked by air traffic control systems not
participating in the exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the computers will be rejoined and tapes from both
sides will be sent to the agency's technical center in Atlantic
City, N.J., for comparison. The results will be released next week.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said all of its systems would be Y2K ready by June
30.

PLANET HOLLYWOOD//AMC VENTURE SCALED BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Almost two years after AMC Entertainment Inc.
and Planet Hollywood decided to reach for the stars together, not
one of their Planet Movies By AMC centers has opened.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was for the once-high-flying Planet Hollywood and AMC
to open mega-movies and restaurants under one roof. By now, the
joint venture was supposed to have eight to 10 up and running
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The reality is that only one is under construction and, if all
goes according to plan, will open late next month in Easton, Ohio,
said AMC spokeswoman Brenda Nolte.
</P>
<P>
   After that, she said, it's wait and see, which raises the
question: What about the joint venture's commitment to Kansas City?
</P>
<P>
   As far as Nick Bashkiroff is concerned, there still is a
commitment to build in downtown Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the chairman of Planet Hollywood standing on stage
and the chairman of AMC standing on stage saying they're going to
come to Kansas City, and that's pretty formal,'' he said, referring
to a news conference in the summer of 1997 announcing the joint
venture.
</P>
<P>
   But Bashkiroff declined to say whether there was a signed lease
for the Planet Hollywood//AMC venture _ or any others for the
downtown Kansas City venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to comment on documents signed or not signed,''
he said. ``That's something that I don't think is necessary for
people outside of the company to know at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   The fortunes of Planet Hollywood have fallen fast. Its original
appeal came from movie prop-laden eateries and movie star names
like Demi Moore, Bruce Willis and Whoopi Goldberg, who as investors
showed up for openings in New York, Paris and London. Movie fans
flocked to the restaurants and, as they departed, were funneled
through stores stocked with glizty, expensive merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   But as more and more of the restaurants have opened, the
investor-stars have been reluctant to make the trek to places like
the Gurnee Mills mall north of Chicago, known for its plethora of
outlet stores, and the mall to end all malls, the Mall of America
outside Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is the food, which hasn't won good reviews and
is expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Bashkiroff conceded as much: ``What you have to remember is that
repeat business is primarily tied to the quality of your
food....It's nice to have all kinds of environmentals...if you
don't expect people to come back (more than once), and with a good
portion of the ticket being merchandise purchases.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Patty Caruso of Planet Hollywood said she wasn't sure
why plans for the Planet Hollywood-AMC venture had been scaled
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they wanted to make sure we didn't go too big too
fast,'' Caruso said. ``Obviously, we're struggling a little bit
right now, and we're in the doldrums, but I think the decision to
pull back was made before that happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Those doldrums are reflected in the financials. On the day it
went public in 1995, Planet Hollywood stock shot up to its all-time
high of 32.
</P>
<P>
   George K. Baum &AMP; Co. analyst Herb Buchbinder said Planet
Hollywood's problems have put a big question mark over the future
of the venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this whole Planet Hollywood thing looking so bad, why
would AMC want to go forward?'' asked Buchbinder. ``They did make a
big deal out of it initially, but it's really cooled off since
then.''

MAXIMUM SENTENCE IMPOSED IN ABUSE OF TWO CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY RIZZO  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLATHE, Kan. _ The scars on the little girl's face are obvious.
It's the emotional damage that is not so easy to see.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents say the girl, now 7, and her 8-year-old brother will
never fully recover from the summer of torture they endured at the
hands of a Merriam woman.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, a Johnson County judge Friday imposed the
maximum sentence of six years in prison for Sandra S. Wheeler.
</P>
<P>
   The children were abused when they stayed with Wheeler last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hollow victory. It can't fix what she did,'' said the
children's mother, Lolita Warnock. ``But she shouldn't get off on
probation.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler pleaded no contest in February to two counts of child
abuse, and District Judge Peter Ruddick found her guilty of the
felony charges.
</P>
<P>
   At that hearing, Assistant District Attorney Sheri McCracken
described how the children were beaten, kicked, bound with duct
tape and burned with hot water and bleach and how clumps of hair
were pulled from their heads.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was dehydrated and lost weight. His sister may have
suffered permanent eye damage.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler is a cousin of the children's father. The children
stayed with her and her three children for about a month last July
and August.
</P>
<P>
   Lolita Warnock said she would never forget the ``haunted look''
on the children's faces when she first saw them after Wheeler took
them back home to the Wichita area.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not over it now. They're not going to be over it in a
year. They're never going to get over it,'' she told the judge
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   She said that even now, whenever the children see the type of
van Wheeler drove, they ask whether it's her.
</P>
<P>
   ``They live with this fear that she might show up,'' Warnock
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler, 35, asked for probation Friday, tearfully pleading with
Ruddick to allow her to remain free so she could receive counseling
and treatment and be with her own three children.
</P>
<P>
   ``My children need me very much,'' Wheeler said. ``I really
don't know how my children will make it without me.''
</P>
<P>
   She described her battles with drugs, caused by the pain of
surgeries that have left her disabled and using a cane.
</P>
<P>
   Her attorney, Jay Norton, asked that she be sent to the
community corrections residential center, which would provide an
intensive, highly supervised probation environment.
</P>
<P>
   Norton said a mental health evaluator found that Wheeler had a
low risk of violent behavior. He called witnesses to testify Friday
that Wheeler was a loving mother.
</P>
<P>
   He said she entered pleas to the charges to spare the children
from having to testify.
</P>
<P>
   McCracken asked for the maximum sentence, saying Wheeler was
asking for the kind of mercy she didn't show with the children.
</P>
<P>
   She said Wheeler threatened to kill them and told them they
would never see their mother again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defendant is their nightmare. She will never go away,''
McCracken said. ``They are scarred.''
</P>
<P>
   Before imposing sentence, Ruddick said he had received many
letters from people supporting Wheeler. Most said they could not
believe she was capable of the kind of abuse she was convicted of
committing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter is it is unbelievable,'' the judge
said. ``It amounted to nothing less than torture.''

LEGISLATURE FAILS TO ADJOURN, WILL RETURN TODAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THE KANSAS CITY STAR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA, Kan. _ The Kansas Legislature had planned to adjourn
Friday for a two-week break, but _ as often happens in the
statehouse _ the proceedings didn't follow the script.
</P>
<P>
   Just after midnight Friday morning, negotiations on a $9 billion
state budget broke down.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the morning, as the full Legislature convened,
sign-carrying protesters patrolled the hallways, some walking, some
in wheelchairs, demanding more money for social service programs.
</P>
<P>
   At midafternoon, negotiators produced a deal on the state
budget. But doubts arose whether the Legislature would approve it,
and anyway, there wasn't enough time to distribute and analyze it
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   To reach a resolution, leaders said they would keep the House
and Senate in session at least through Saturday. After a break, the
Legislature will return April 28.
</P>
<P>
   In further maneuvering over highway construction, a proposal
bubbled to the surface, then disappeared in favor of still another
plan. But that one, too, failed to attract enough support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty close to chaos, but not nearly as much as the
House,'' said Sen. Audrey Langworthy, a Prairie Village Republican.
``That's normal for this time of year. You've just got to keep
talking and negotiating.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Robin Jennison, a Healy Republican, disagreed. ``I
don't think things are in chaos,'' Jennison said. ``But I would
have liked to have had the budget done and gotten out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   The budget wrangling involves how much to spend on the
Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services, and how to
rechannel money from administration to programs.
</P>
<P>
   The 12:30 a.m. Friday walkout occurred when Senate budget
negotiators made an offer to their House counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said: `That's unacceptable. Let's stay here and talk,' ''
said Rep. Phill Kline, a Shawnee Republican who is the House
appropriations chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dave Kerr, a Hutchinson Republican who is the Senate
appropriations chairman, then declared the meeting over and
departed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were tired and ready to go home,'' Kerr said. ``We're just
country kids. We're not used to staying up that late.''
</P>
<P>
   When the negotiators reconvened Friday, lobbyists and staff
members filled every available chair in the room.
</P>
<P>
   Activists seeking more funding for social programs milled in the
hallways, some of them carrying signs. ``Fund People Not Things,''
one placard read.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few hours, a deal emerged
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, I'm pleased,'' Kline said. ``I wish we would be a
little tighter on spending.''
</P>
<P>
   One key point was money for programs that aid the
developmentally disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Activists were seeking to preserve current funding for people
already in community programs, eliminate a 350-person waiting list
of persons needing care and increase the pay for workers who
provide the care.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative budget deal gave them some of what they wanted.
Money to eliminate the waiting list was removed. They vowed to
press the Legislature for more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no choice but to come back,'' said Tom Laing, director
of InterHab and an advocate for community programs.
</P>
<P>
   Further budget debate will occur when the Legislature finishes
in late April. The highway construction issue will await action
then.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, leaders struggled to craft a transportation plan
that would attract enough votes.
</P>
<P>
   A negotiated version late in the morning was too modest for
Senate Democrats, and they said a larger plan should be offered to
the House.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday afternoon, a slightly more ambitious plan emerged,
but a nose count of Republicans failed to show enough votes, and
Senate President Dick Bond, an Overland Park Republican, called it
quits for the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's considerable support for a highway plan,'' he
said. ``The question is, what's it going to look like.''
</P>
<P>
   He said further work on a transportation plan should be
postponed until lawmakers return at the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd better go home, cool off and come back fresh,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The last proposal Republicans and Democrats presented to their
members in informal meetings would have increased the gasoline tax
by 6 cents a gallon, boosted car and truck registration fees and
provided authority to issue up to $950 million of bonds for roads,
bridges, airports and railroads.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats complained that money for public schools was being
pushed aside as Republicans pressed for a transportation plan.
</P>
<P>
   By late in the day, Senate Democrats were saying they wanted
support for a $50-a-student increase in school aid this year and
next.
</P>
<P>
   Bond countered: ``Democrats want to leverage education against
highways. I'm not interested in trades. Each issue has to stand on
its own merits.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid all the activity, Rep. Mike O'Neal, a Hutchinson
Republican, left the statehouse to get married. A few hours later,
he and his wife, Cindy O'Neal, who is also his secretary, were back
in the Statehouse.

ADVOCATES LOOK FOR ANOTHER CHANCE FOR CONCEALED-WEAPONS
LEGISLATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIT WAGAR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Missouri gun-rights' advocates, still angry
about the rejection of concealed handguns, are looking toward next
year's race for governor as the best chance of getting a law on the
books.
</P>
<P>
   And many are looking for revenge on organizations and
politicians who helped defeat Proposition B, which on Tuesday
failed 52 percent to 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other gun advocates blame the loss on vote fraud, the governor
or newspapers. A few even blame the National Rifle Association for
not spending more, even through it spent nearly $4 million, almost
five times as much as the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Others saw in the election results the foundation of a future
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Citizens in 104 of 114 counties held that the right to carry
was the right thing for them,'' said Whit O'Daniel, field director
for Missourians Against Crime. ``So the right to carry is not dead.
The right governor would make a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Proposition B went to a public vote because Gov. Mel Carnahan, a
Democrat, has consistently threatened to veto any measure allowing
concealed weapons. Carnahan's term ends next year.
</P>
<P>
   But both parties' leading candidates in next year's race say
they would not sign a bill like Proposition B, which would have
allowed Missourians to carry concealed handguns with relatively few
restrictions. Both, however, left enough wiggle room to support a
more-stringent proposal.
</P>
<P>
   State Treasurer Bob Holden, the Democratic front-runner, opposed
Proposition B and said he did not see the need for people to carry
concealed guns.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was more inclined to favor what is known as a
``may-issue'' law, which requires applicants to have a strong
reason for needing to carry a gun and gives authorities broad
discretion on who gets a permit.
</P>
<P>
   A bill might be palatable if it restricted where concealed guns
could be carried and limited permit holders to off-duty and retired
police officers, court personnel and others with a demonstrated
need, Holden said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Jim Talent, the front-runner for the Republican
nomination, supported Proposition B as a crime deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   After Tuesday's vote, in which Talent's home turf of St. Louis
County was the decisive factor, Talent said he would not sign a
similar bill if he were governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people made their decision, and you have to respect
that,'' Talent said. ``But I think the legislature could find a way
to address some of the concerns people had.''
</P>
<P>
   Talent said he could support a ``may-issue'' law. He said he
preferred ``shall-issue'' proposals like Proposition B, which
require authorities to issue permits to anyone who fits the
qualifications. Shall-issue laws have worked well in other states,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gun-rights advocates would find a ``may-issue'' law hard to
swallow. At a Web site sponsored by Missourians for Personal
Safety, several people posted suggestions on ways to tighten the
proposal to make it more acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   They said to prohibit guns near schools, in bars or at sports
stadiums and to exclude permits from people convicted of
misdemeanor sex crimes. But several others opposed that approach.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of messages suggested boycotting companies such as
Hallmark Cards Inc. that gave money to fight Proposition B. Others
suggested refusing to contribute to fund-raisers run by the Police
Chiefs Association and the Sheriff's Association _ even though the
Sheriff's Association was neutral.
</P>
<P>
   Several messages picked up on the National Rifle Association's
attack on Carnahan last week, vowing to take revenge next year when
he runs for the U.S. Senate. Carnahan did not actively campaign
against Proposition B, but the association still blamed him.
</P>
<P>
   The association said Carnahan orchestrated the campaign against
concealed weapons. He even dispatched his daughter, Robin, to run
Safe Schools and Workplaces, which led the opposition, the
association said. Carnahan spokesman Chris Sifford scoffed at the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's 37 years old,'' Sifford said. ``She didn't ask her dad
whether she could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Safe Schools spokeswoman Lawren Massey said it was all sour
grapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wrote the bill, they picked the date for the vote, and
they managed the entire process, and now that it's decided, they
can't accept the choice that Missourians made,'' Massey said.

MEDIA, OTHERS LAMENT LACK OF DETAILS ABOUT AIR CAMPAIGN OVER
SERBIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MUPRHY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In this, the information age, there is an
information gap between the war front in Yugoslavia and the home
front in America.
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be just the way the Pentagon wants it.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists and other war-watchers are lamenting the lack of
details about the NATO air campaign over Serbia. They want more
specifics on the numbers of air missions, targets hit, tonnage of
bombs dropped and casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Pentagon often falls back on the term ``degraded''
to describe the effect of air strikes on Serbian capabilities. The
word was used six times, for example, in an 11-line Pentagon
statement Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They make these very vague claims of degrading, but their
claims are extremely limited and there is no sign of a decisive
effect on the ground,'' said John Steinbruner, a senior fellow in
foreign policy studies at the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbruner thinks the Pentagon would be happy to reveal more if
it had something positive to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own guess is that if there was a compelling display of
effectiveness directly linked to the operation in Kosovo, we'd be
seeing it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said there have been many successful bombing
missions, but describing them all publicly would help Yugoslav
leader Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information you provide to him on what we believe we have
accomplished, how we accomplished it, what munitions we used, what
aircraft we used, when they took off, when they landed, all those
kinds of things, play into an intelligence picture we do not at
this point want to provide,'' Capt. Michael Doubleday, deputy
assistant secretary of defense, told reporters this week.
</P>
<P>
   But some Pentagon reporters said that Milosevic will know most
of what he needs to know about an attack after it's over, and that
to withhold information prevents the public from deciding whether
the war is advisable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's helpful in the long run,'' said Dana Priest
of The Washington Post. ``They don't give us any data, even weeks
later, to help us independently assess the advocacy of the air
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Priest and Richard Parker, defense correspondent for Knight
Ridder Newspapers, said the Pentagon gave out much more information
during other military campaigns, including daily reports on damage
inflicted in the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't get any of that,'' Parker said. ``We don't know where
the targets are, by and large. The maps they use each day have
markings on them, but only show generally what sort of target it
was and roughly what part of Serbia it was in.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday and Friday, the Pentagon did release its most
detailed photographs and films yet of air-strike damage, but they
still amounted mostly ``to a snapshot of one night's work,'' Parker
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still don't know cumulatively what is going on,'' Parker
said.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Richard Bridges, director of defense information at the
Pentagon, said the government was not obligated ``to put a
scorecard out there'' cataloging bomb damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very frankly, I don't think the American people or the people
of Kansas City want the amount of detail the media are asking
for,'' Bridges said.
</P>
<P>
   To a degree, the press is a victim of its own technological
advances. The Internet and 24-hour new channels produce
instantaneous information that could help the enemy, Bridges said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can report real-time aircraft taking off and show
pictures of the weapons they are carrying,'' Bridges said. ``That
is about as early a warning as you can get. This is a different
world that it was 10 years ago and it requires the application of
different concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Another difference from 10 years ago _ shortly before the
Persian Gulf War _ is that the military leadership has changed.
Priest said Defense Secretary William Cohen was less open than his
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cohen is very insular, he keeps his business tight,'' Priest
said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, retired Lt. Gen. Tom Kelly recalled media briefings
he gave on the Persian Gulf War under the leadership of Gen. Colin
Powell and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had two minutes of guidance from Colin Powell before I went
down there,'' Kelly said. ``He said, `Don't go down there and start
any fights and don't address future operations.' I wasn't told I
wasn't allowed to tell them anything else. Our assumption was that
everything comes out in the long run, so don't cover it up.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was easier for the Pentagon to talk about the Persian
Gulf War than about Serbia because it was an American campaign,
whereas 19-member NATO is in control of the Serbian effort, said
retired Army Col. Ken Allard.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is an altogether more committee-prone structure,'' said
Allard, now a senior associate with the Center for International
and Strategic Studies. ``You tend to get a much more homogenized
version of the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker agreed that NATO is a roadblock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think NATO knows but isn't saying and I think a lot of
people here don't know until much later what happened,'' Parker
said. ``Cohen doesn't want to upset the allies and they control the
message.''
</P>
<P>
   Allard said the Pentagon is justified in keeping from the media
details that could hamper the war effort and risk American lives.
He thinks the real problem is an absence of information on why the
Serbian campaign was started and why it isn't more aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``In (the Persian Gulf War) we used overwhelming force to
achieve some very specific objectives,'' Allard said. ``Here, we
are using an underwhelming force for very vague purposes.''

EDS: RESENDING TO CORRECT BYLINE  
 `OUT OF THE CHANNEL' A PAINFUL LOOK BACK AT SPILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Anybody who loves the marine environments and maritime
communities of the Pacific Coast should, albeit with a bit of pain,
read John Keeble's ``Out of the Channel: The Exxon-Valdez Oil Spill
in Prince William Sound.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is an investigative work, as well as a personal memoir,
of the greatest environmental disaster to hit the United States,
and of its yet-to-end aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Originally issued after the spill, ``Out of the Channel'' has
been updated to show how the spill set off a succession of
discouraging events. They include the high death rates in a killer
whale pod that resides in the pristine environment fouled by the
spill, the destructive clearcutting of forests by cash-strapped
native corporations, and a back-door deal between Exxon and a group
of seven Seattle-based seafood processors.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon quietly paid out a $70 million settlement for fishing
losses to the ``Seattle Seven.'' Secretly, however, the processors
agreed to apply for their share of any punitive damages awarded to
fishermen suing the oil giant. They would then hand the money back
to Exxon.
</P>
<P>
   A writing professor at Eastern Washington University, Keeble has
an eye for characters. Several are from the village of Cordova,
Alaska, whose fishermen fought against construction of the
Trans-Alaska Pipeline and warned that the Alyeska Pipeline Co. was
not prepared to deal with a spill.
</P>
<P>
   He relates a memorable prediction, delivered by phone to a
meeting in Valdez just six hours before the Exxon-Valdez went
aground on Bligh Reef. It came from Dr. Riki Ott, a marine
biologist and Cordova-based gillnetter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the high frequency of tankers into Port Valdez, the
increasing age and size of the tanker fleet, and the inability to
quickly contain and clean up an oil spill in the open water of
Alaska, fishermen feel that we are playing a game of Russian
roulette,'' Ott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When, not if, The Big One does occur and much or all of the
income from a fishing season is lost, compensation for processors,
support industries and local communities will be difficult if not
impossible to obtain,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The prediction has proven remarkably accurate. Exxon has used a
multiplicity of appeals to avoid paying a $5.3 billion civil
judgment awarded in 1994 by an Anchorage jury. In Cordova, the
largest cannery has closed. The value of a fishing license is
perhaps one-tenth of what it was before the spill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of the Channel'' is not a book of stereotypes. Keeble is
sympathetic to Capt. Joe Hazelwood, depicted as a drunken
ne'er-do-well even though he wasn't on the bridge at the time of
the accident. Keeble is scathing toward the U.S. Coast Guard for
its haphazard tracking of tankers and can't-happen-here attitude.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, Exxon has cleverly cut its losses from the '89
disaster. Its scientists claim that Prince William Sound has
completely recovered. Oil company apologists in the media have
taken to beating up Cordova, claiming the fishing village is
inhabited by people with nothing to do in the winter but watch
television and endlessly complain.
</P>
<P>
   Keeble presents a far truer picture. His Cordova is a town that
refuses to let Prince William Sound become the petroleum industry's
Potemkin Village, and dares to assert that a multinational company
must pay for the damage it did to a once-vibrant economy.

MARINERS NEED A HOT TEAM TO WARM FANS IN NEW BALLPARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Walking into the Kingdome nearing twilight Friday, the
new ballyard looming, something occurred to me:
</P>
<P>
   Man, was it cold.
</P>
<P>
   OK, not a great scoop. But as excuses go, it's a valid one most
April evenings in Seattle for staying inside.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the new ballpark is not inside. It's outside, of
all places.
</P>
<P>
   True, it has a gargantuan carport. But underneath, no heaters.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that always the case these days when you spend $517
million? Go cheap, and you get what you pay for.
</P>
<P>
   As a factor in the playing of baseball, cold is nothing compared
to rain. Unless, of course, one makes a living hitting home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you think Albert Belle left Chicago?'' Ken Griffey Jr.
asked in his usual mischievous manner before the game.
</P>
<P>
   Becoming baseball's highest-paid player in 1999 ($11.9 million)
might have something to do with it. But Griffey would like to think
Belle's motivation included Camden Yards' shorter fences and
Baltimore's warmer springs.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey holds fast to the baseball belief that cold, heavy air
retards the flight of the ball. So if Friday night's Kingdome game
against Oakland had been held next door, the game definitely would
have been retarded, longball-wise.
</P>
<P>
   And if the Mariners' thick-armed offense is retarded, what would
be the point of sitting in 38 degrees for three hours?
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what will happen to the ball over there,''
Griffey said of the new digs, ``but if the ball doesn't go, then
what?''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey chuckled at the prospect of bringing in the new park's
fences yet again. He speculated that in the space between the
fences and the bleachers, the Mariners can create a big picnic and
party area.
</P>
<P>
   Or, if moving the fences means yet another unexpected expense
for a stadium that may yet out-price the Kennedy Space Center, the
Mariners could simply be remade into a pitching-dominant team. That
shouldn't take any longer than paying off the stadium bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the ball doesn't carry,'' Griffey said, ``how many
(big-hitting) free agents are you going to attract here?''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's musings about the new park came amid some curiosity
about the attendance numbers of the infant season. After a 13-year
low of 51,656 for an opening night, crowds of 20,435 and 21,050
finished out the White Sox series. Friday's game against the A's
drew 24,823, and the pre-sale for Saturday's annual Bat Night
promotion, normally a crowd in the 45,000 range, is about 28,000.
</P>
<P>
   Most ominous is that sales of season tickets, including the new
park, are 20,500, just a thousand more than the Kingdome
full-season record. The Mariners planned to cut off season ticket
sales at 24,000, but apparently the region's baseball fans saved
them the trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the obvious factors of a young season and unglamorous
opposition, the Mariners did little in the run-up to engender a
buzz, new yard notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was our big story?'' Griffey asked in his series of
self-answering questions. ``Will Griffey and A-Rod re-sign?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, almost the entire winter discussion of the Mariners,
with the notable exception of Jay Buhner's remarkable
rehabilitation from elbow surgery, was about what they can't,
couldn't or won't do. Not exactly the kind of thing to set a
marquee ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariner owners' disengagement from baseball's economic
battles, no matter how well-reasoned, has cast something of a pall.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 strategy thus far appears to rely exclusively on the
undeniable appeal of blue skies and green grass. The problem is the
honeymoon for the park may be far briefer than many imagined if
fans are allowed to spend their time the way the Mariner bosses
spent theirs _ coming up with reasons to disengage.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) Don't get attached to Griffey; he'll be gone. Don't
get attached to A-Rod; he'll be gone. Mariner pitchers are too old
and too young. Tickets are too expensive. There's no parking. It's
too cold. It's too hot (OK, the last one was a reach). (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   The tendency among some fans to avoid potentially futile
emotional investment is part of why Griffey called Mariner
president Chuck Armstrong in the off-season to suggest trading top
pitching prospect Ryan Anderson (``Space Needle,'' Griffey calls
him) for Roger Clemens, who subsequently went from the Blue Jays to
the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Said Griffey: ``Imagine what people would be saying about us if
we had Clemens.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Mariners have chosen rivets over Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the new park will be magnificent. But unless there is a
compelling team cavorting on its lawn, the possibility looms larger
that the region's baseball fans could let novelty wear thin
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Remember how a succession of Mariner owners and execs insisted
that baseball would never work in an ugly indoor park during
gorgeous Seattle summers?
</P>
<P>
   That would be baffling news to the 8.4 million Mariner fans who
attended Kingdome games the last three years. The park, it would
seem, comes in second to the play.
</P>
<P>
   For $517 million, one would think they had thought of
everything.

SHORT GAME WALTZES OLAZABAL INTO MASTERS LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Getting back on your feet again is a figure of
speech. For Jose Maria Olazabal, it was a goal, a dream, and for
the longest time, an impossibility.
</P>
<P>
   For 18 months in the mid-1990s, the leader of the Masters could
not walk, suffering from a lower back hernia that caused severe
pain in his feet. Friday, Olazabal cruised around Augusta National
effortlessly, firing a 6-under-par 66 to take a one-shot advantage
over Scott McCarron after two rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly rejuvenated at 44, Greg Norman is in a tie for third
place with U.S. Open champion Lee Janzen at 139, turning Magnolia
Lane into memory lane. They are three shots behind Olazabal, who is
at 8-under for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   If you're still looking for Tiger Woods and David Duval, the
supposed favorites, you'll find them far down the leaderboard.
Woods lofted one into Rae's Creek Friday and shot his second
consecutive even-par round. Duval had a 74, leaving the world's
top-ranked player at 145, nine shots back.
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal, a 33-year-old Spaniard, has long been recognized as
one of the world's finest golfers, winning 21 tournaments across
the globe, including a Masters championship in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He always plays well at Augusta, finishing 14th or higher in
seven of his past eight appearances. That knowledge is helping him
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very special place for me,'' Olazabal said.
``Experience is a great factor here. The more you know the course,
the more you know what you have to do, where you have to hit the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Olazabal had direction, hitting 13 of 17 greens and
stroking only 25 putts. Three years ago, he didn't know where he
was going. He thought he was headed for a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could hardly walk,'' Olazabal said. ``I watched golf and TV
and listened to music. It was not very nice at all. When you can't
walk, that's the lowest you can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal was misdiagnosed by three doctors, including one from
the Mayo Clinic. They all thought he had rheumatoid arthritis in
his feet. He eventually got another opinion from a German doctor
who discovered that his foot problems were being caused by a lower
back hernia.
</P>
<P>
   His treatment consisted of physical therapy along with
injections of iron, zinc, amino acids and shark cartilage, which
could still come in handy if Norman closes in this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days when I woke up in the morning, I knew my first
move would be to the bathroom,'' he told the Manchester Guardian.
``It was only nine feet from by bedroom, but I couldn't get there
on my feet. I had to crawl. I would get very, very depressed. I
wanted to just walk again at that time. I never thought of suicide
because always in the back of my mind, I hoped I might be made well
again that I could play golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal could not drive a car or a golf ball. For six months,
he did not touch a club. A cane seemed like a more realistic
possibility until he got the proper diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   He did not play in a golf tournament from September 1995 to
February '97, missing the '96 Masters, two years after winning the
green jacket. He watched the tournament from his home in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always have to try to be positive in a situation like
that,'' Olazabal said. ``I was just thinking that one day I will be
back there.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, he was. Olazabal has a wonderful quick tempo and
splendid short game that he crafted as an adolescent. At the age of
15, he noticed that his friends were typically hitting the ball 30
to 40 yards farther than him. To compensate, he worked on shots
around the green.
</P>
<P>
   The early practice may have contributed to two par-saving
recoveries Friday. A chip from behind the fifth green led to a par
putt from 7 feet. A blast from a greenside bunker at 7 led to a par
putt from 12 feet.
</P>
<P>
   At 15, Olazabal birdied after coaxing a delicate chip down a
severe slope within one foot of the hole. He capped his round with
a birdie putt from 10 feet at the 18th.
</P>
<P>
   McCarron, a 33-year-old from Sacramento, seems like a fun guy to
have a beer with at the 19th hole. He and his buddies at UCLA used
to have a few on Friday night before they would settle in to watch
the Masters on the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   McCarron figured a TV set was as close as he would get to
Augusta. He wanted to turn pro but realized he wasn't good enough.
He worked with his father in the golf apparel business before
rekindling his game.
</P>
<P>
   He used to putt left-handed but has become more successful with
a long putter more commonly seen on the senior tour. The highlight
of McCarron's round came when he used that oversized wand and
drained a 55-footer at No. 4, the only birdie of the day at the
205-yard hole.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, McCarron has used his length off the tee and touch on
the greens to become a legitimate candidate to win the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do I get my power from?'' he said in response to a
question. ``I don't know. I've always hit the golf ball far. It's
only recently that I've been able to find it after I hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually, if you are looking for McCarron, he's somewhere in the
middle of the pack or in the column under ``Missed Cut.'' But he
feels comfortable in these surroundings, in this kind of company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider myself a lesser-known,'' McCarron said.
``When I'm playing with Norman or (Fred) Couples, I feel I'm as
good as them. You have to believe that or you don't belong out
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal is just happy to be out here again. When asked about a
shot that he hit at 13 on Thursday, when his ball miraculously
skipped across the hazard and landed safely on the other side,
Olazabal said: ``It was a good break, but I haven't had too many
breaks in my life, so I'll take that one.''
</P>
<P>
   If Olazabal continues to play like he has, this weekend might be
a grueling test for everyone else, but just a walk in the park for
him.

SHARK HOPING NEW OUTLOOK KEEPS IN MASTERS CONTENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Blazing into contention, Greg Norman returned to
Augusta National yesterday, and now everyone is wondering if his
demons will too.
</P>
<P>
   The dashing Australian shot a 4-under-par 68 to move into a tie
for third place and within three shots of leader Jose Maria
Olazabal after the second round of The Masters.
</P>
<P>
   Although Olazabal will command much of the attention this
afternoon, Norman has the most intriguing storyline. Rejected three
times here, he was defeated by Jack Nicklaus in 1986, demoralized
by Larry Mize in '87 and devastated by Nick Faldo in '96.
</P>
<P>
   The setback three years ago was one of the most memorable
collapses in golf. Norman entered the final round with a six-shot
lead and lost to Nick Faldo by five strokes after shooting a 78.
</P>
<P>
   How will he hold up this weekend? Will he win his first green
jacket? Will he respond under pressure or wilt like he has in the
past?
</P>
<P>
   Reporters fired questions at Norman, who handled every one of
them like the deft veteran he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm quite enjoying it, to tell you the truth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since undergoing shoulder surgery last April that forced him to
give up golf for seven months, Norman has undergone a
transformation. He looks at golf as being a part of life, but not
the largest part. He would rather be at home with his wife, Laura,
and teen-aged kids, Morgan-Leigh and Gregory, than on the driving
range.
</P>
<P>
   Norman has a big-picture perspective that could, in an ironic
development, produce a Masters title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he tried too hard,'' said David Leadbetter, his coach.
``A different attitude can really help in this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Laura Norman, ``He realized there are other things in life.
That may translate into playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   When Mark O'Meara decided to quit being a perfectionist, he won
The Masters and British Open last year. Now that Norman has stopped
being so driven, perhaps the dividends will be evident Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling extremely relaxed and in control of what I'm
doing,'' Norman said. ``I don't have a sense of urgency. Urgency is
something where you're trying to force the issue. If you try to
force the issue, you don't relax on the golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman still has the desire. He believes that, even at 44, he
can win The Masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just as big a killer as I've ever been on the golf course
_ as I used to be _ because I want it,'' he said. ``But at the same
time, I've surrounded myself with the right things, and it takes a
lot of pressure off. Golf is not everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman bogeyed the first hole Friday to fall to even-par. The
old Norman might have pressed and ended up losing patience and
ground to the leaders. The new Norman stuck with it and did not
have another bogey. He was solid and spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   Once a lamentable figure, Norman could become the conversation
piece that talks back this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the tragedies we have had here, it would be a little
sweeter for us,'' said Laura Norman.
</P>
<P>
   His wife added that Norman was bothered more by Mize's
sudden-death chip-in than Faldo's victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greg just didn't play well (against Faldo),'' she said. ``When
you don't play well, you can justify losing.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Faldo defeat stands out because of the way it happened,
a supposedly gifted golfer proved that even the most skilled can
suffer mental breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Norman said the loss to Faldo had more of a positive than
negative impact. He still hears from people offering encouragement,
stemming from what happened three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``My locker is full of letters this week,'' he said. ``It
changed my life and made me appreciate people in a different way
because of the support they gave me.''
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, Norman would feel vindicated if he earns the green
jacket Sunday. Friday, he would not speculate on the possibility.
But his wife did, revealing that part of Norman's competitive
nature will never go away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a heartbreaker for him here,'' Laura Norman said.
``I don't think it would make everything else OK. At the end of the
day, he would still say he wanted the other two.''

KARROS DOUBLES FUN FOR DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On a night when Gary Sheffield was on the bench
with a sore right hip, the Los Angeles Dodgers' offense got a jolt
from first baseman Eric Karros.
</P>
<P>
   Karros tied a Dodgers record with three doubles and led a 17-hit
attack as the Dodgers rebounded from their lone loss of the season
with a 9-6 win Friday night over the Colorado Rockies at Dodger
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Karros also tied a career high with four hits, scored twice, had
an RBI and even stole his second base of the season. Devon White
also tied a career high with four hits.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Dreifort (1-0) won in his season debut, though it was
sometimes laboring. He allowed three hits and three runs (two
earned) and struck out seven, but he also wasn't very pitch
efficient. He threw 98 pitches (54 strikes) in five innings. Jeff
Shaw got the final three outs for his second save.
</P>
<P>
   Rockies starter John Thomson (0-1) was knocked out in the fourth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Karros' third double, a drive to the left-center-field fence,
scored Todd Hundley to give the Dodgers a 6-4 lead. Karros stole
third, and after Mike DeJean relieved Chuck McElroy and walked
Adrian Beltre, Jacob Brumfield's infield single plated Karros to
make it 7-4.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Dave Hansen continued his hot start with a single
to right to score Beltre with the Dodgers' eighth run.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers staked Dreifort the four-run lead, but up reared the
control problems Dreifort tends to suffer from inning to inning.
</P>
<P>
   He had allowed one hit through four innings, though he needed a
baserunning blunder by Dante Bichette to get out of a bases-loaded
situation in the second. Dreifort, who tied a career high with six
walks, walked three Rockies in that inning but was unscathed when
Jeff Reed lined to shortstop Jose Vizcaino, who caught the ball and
also caught Bichette breaking for home instead of back to the base.
Vizcaino fired to Beltre for the double play.
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't the end of the walks for Dreifort. After looking
masterful and appearing confident in striking out the side in the
fourth, he walked Darryl Hamilton with two outs in the fifth.
Hamilton stole second and Neifi Perez followed with a base hit to
center. But with the memory fresh of White throwing out Mike
Lansing at home Thursday, Hamilton held at third.
</P>
<P>
   Why steal a base with two outs and then hold on a single to
center? It didn't matter because Dreifort uncorked one of his three
wild pitches to allow Hamilton to score and cut the Dodgers lead to
5-2. Dreifort then walked Angel Echevarria, and Perez scored on a
single by Bichette. Vinny Castilla struck out to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The final Dodger to appear this season was Dave Mlicki, who took
over for Dreifort. Mlicki, the sixth starter in a five-man
rotation, gave up a leadoff double to Hamilton in the seventh.
Hamilton went to third on a fly out and scored on Roberto Ramirez's
single to right as the Rockies pulled within 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers took a 1-0 lead in the second when Karros doubled
and scored on Beltre's double to right field.
</P>
<P>
   Perez scored on Eric Young's throwing error in the third to even
the score 1-1, but the Dodgers answered quickly. White, who singled
in his first three at-bats, began the rally in the third with a
one-out hit. His hustle and baserunning savvy gave the Dodgers a
2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Mondesi singled to left and White made a wide turn around
second. Rockies left fielder Bichette tried to throw behind White
at second, so White immediately broke toward third. Lansing, the
Rockies' second baseman, threw the ball wildly to third, allowing
White to score and Mondesi wound up on third.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi scored on a wild pitch to give the Dodgers a 3-1 lead.
Todd Hundley singled and Karros doubled to put runners in scoring
position, but all the Dodgers could muster was a Beltre sacrifice
fly to make it 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers padded their lead in the fourth, but they might have
run themselves out of a bigger inning. Young singled with one out
and went to third on Vizcaino's double. White singled to right to
score Young and put the Dodgers ahead 5-1, but the chance for the
big inning was squelched when Vizcaino was thrown out at the plate
by Echevarria. It came with Mondesi on deck.

LAKERS BEAT TIMBERWOLVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Few who saw Friday night's game will buy the
notion _ in fact, the very words seem absurd _ but the Los Angeles
Lakers wake up today as a resurgent force in the Western
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   By virtue of a too-difficult 96-89 victory over the Minnesota
Timberwolves at the Forum, the Lakers reclaimed fourth place in the
conference for the first time since March 25.
</P>
<P>
   With two straight wins, a home-court seeding (for now) and
something resembling momentum, the Lakers can now focus on a
stretch run that will give them four shots at conference-leading
Portland, starting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   They hardly appear up to the task, based on Friday's near loss
to a depleted Timberwolves team that was down two starters.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers squandered a 10-point, third-quarter lead and let the
Wolves pull ahead by two points five minutes into the fourth.
Minnesota was missing offensive stalwarts Joe Smith and Terrell
Brandon, and Kevin Garnett had an off-night. But little-known Tom
Hammonds scored 22 points _ 12 in the fourth quarter _ to lead a
surprising charge.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota forged its last tie at 84-84 with about two minutes to
go, but Shaquille O'Neal staved off the upset, scoring four
straight points, then feeding Robert Horry for a layup to regain a
four-point lead with a just over a minute to go.
</P>
<P>
   Former Clippers guard James Robinson threw up a 3-point airball
with about a minute left to end the threat, and Glen Rice's two
free throws secured a 93-87 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal and Rice finished with 25 points each, and Horry provided
a needed punch with 13 points on 5-for-5 shooting, and seven
rebounds off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   With 12 games to go, there's precious little time for
momentum-building toward the postseason. What the Lakers really
need is a long string of wins to ensure a top-four seeding in the
conference and home-court advantage in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we're going _ winning one, losing one, winning two,
losing one _ I think we can't afford to focus on anything but our
game,'' Derek Harper said. ``I think right now everyone is
jockeying themselves for the end of the season and trying to be on
a positive note. You want to end the season on a positive to go
into the playoffs and be playing good basketball at the end of the
season. That's where our focus should be. Hopefully, that's where
it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers led 50-43 at halftime, but they should have had a
much bigger cushion against a depleted Timberwolves team.
</P>
<P>
   Starting forward Smith was attending his father's funeral, and
starting point guard Brandon was out with a right thigh contusion,
leaving Minnesota with a starting lineup of Garnett and four guys
they picked up at the ``Y'' _ Sam Mitchell, Dean Garrett, Bobby
Jackson and Malik Sealy.
</P>
<P>
   Even Garnett wasn't at full strength, playing with a bruised
abdomen suffered the night before against the Clippers. But he was
healthy enough to post 12 points and seven rebounds in the first
half, and along with Sam Mitchell's 10 points, kept the Wolves
close.
</P>
<P>
   Led by 17 points from Rice and 13 points and 10 rebounds from
O'Neal, the Lakers shot 52.5 percent in the half and outrebounded
Minnesota 24-19. Somehow, even shooting 38.3 percent, the Wolves
pulled within two points around the two-minute mark. But a late
surge, started with a Rice 3-pointer, gave the Lakers the
seven-point edge at the half.

FINLEY BEATS RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Chuck Finley has had this love-hate
relationship with the Texas Rangers during his career. He loves
coming to Texas because his parents always make the trip from his
home state of Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   But he hates losing and that's what the Anaheim Angels pitcher
always seems to do against the Rangers. Not this time, though.
</P>
<P>
   Finley gave the Angels exactly what they needed _ six good
innings _ and the offense snapped its minislump in an 8-4 Angels
victory Friday before 31,633 at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Finley (1-0) had not beaten the Rangers since June 29, 1995, and
it took a 20-run outburst by the Angels offense in that one. He
entered Friday's game with a personal nine-game losing streak
against the Rangers and a 7-16 lifetime mark, including 4-9 in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Was Finley worried about the streak?
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't, but my parents were, he said. ``My dad (Charles)
mentioned if I didn't do good he was going to charge me for gas.
But I could give up eight runs and he'll hug me and say I did a
good job. Thank God he doesn't know what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley was not dominating by any means _ he gave up four runs
and nine hits _ but he was efficient while making 91 pitches,
striking out five and walking one. No Angels starter had gone more
than 41/3 innings in the club's first three games, and the bullpen
needed a break.
</P>
<P>
   Finley, who was pushed back in the starting rotation because a
neck strain during spring training, provided such a break, handing
the ball over to Mark Petkovsek to start the seventh. Petkovsek,
acquired from the Cardinals during the offseason, threw two
scoreless innings and was followed by Troy Percival, who pitched a
1-2-3 ninth.
</P>
<P>
   It all started with Finley, even if he didn't get off to a good
start. He gave up three runs and seven hits in the first three
innings before settling into a groove.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started going with more slow stuff after the first three
innings,'' Finley said. ``I started throwing curveballs and splits
and spotted the fastball around. (Catcher) Charlie (O'Brien) did a
great job orchestrating the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course it helped Finley that the offense escaped the spell
the Indians pitching staff had put on the team. After the three
season-opening games against the Indians, the Angels began the
four-game set with Texas hitting .202 (19 for 94) as a team.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Palmeiro, getting his third consecutive start in left
field, set the tone early, hitting his first major-league home run
to lead off the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave us a real lift in the first inning,'' Angels manager
Terry Collins said. ``I sensed a different atmosphere on the bench
tonight. They said we've got to pick it up and get it going. We
can't let these guys trample over us. I was happy to see the guys
picked it especially after a long night.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels didn't arrive in Texas until 7 a.m. Friday and didn't
get to their hotel until about 8. But it didn't seem to affect the
hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Salmon homered (No.2) and doubled. Troy Glaus had two hits,
including a two-run double and Todd Greene hit his first home run
of the season. Randy Velarde, Darin Erstad and Andy Sheets also had
two hits apiece in the 12-hit attack. Rangers starter John Burkett
(0-1) lasted only 22/3 innings (5 runs, 7 hits).
</P>
<P>
   For one night anyway, no one was worried about a lineup that
didn't have Mo Vaughn, Jim Edmonds and Gary DiSarcina. And when
Palmeiro led off the game with his homer (one homer in 418
major-league at-bats), the Angels had to know it was going to be
their night and a memorable one for Palmeiro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had about three (homers) since Little League, so I kind
of remember 'em,'' he said. ``I was coming around third base and
Tim Belcher told me to slow down. I said I know what I'm doing.
Let's get this over with.''

IN NL WEST, IQ A BIG STAT CATEGORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's a mental Murderers Row, the greatest
collection of baseball brainpower since John J. McGraw dined alone.
</P>
<P>
   The National League West presents a rare challenge for new
arrival Davey Johnson of the Los Angeles Dodgers. Almost every time
he looks across a baseball diamond this season, attempting to read
the opposing manager, he'll see brilliance staring back.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they'll be seeing the same in him.
</P>
<P>
   There's Colorado's Jim Leyland, Johnson's opposite number Friday
night, his cigarette-burned fingers clutching a $2 million-a-year
contract, richest in the history of baseball managers.
</P>
<P>
   There's San Francisco's Dusty Baker, the only manager to wear
wristbands, because you can work up a sweat squeezing 90 wins out
of the division's poorest franchise.
</P>
<P>
   There's San Diego's Bruce Bochy, hard-looking under those albino
eyelashes but really a nice guy, maligned for the pitching moves
that backfired in Game 1 of the World Series but deserving credit
for the pennant.
</P>
<P>
   There's Arizona's Buck Showalter, a weary-looking 42-year-old,
the only one of the group who hasn't won a division title, though
he was on his way with the '94 Yankees before the strike.
</P>
<P>
   And there's Johnson, owner of the highest career winning
percentage among active major-league managers, a percentage that
edged upward to .576 with a 9-6 victory over Leyland's Rockies on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely, maybe never, has there been a division like this, in
which every manager has a Manager of the Year trophy somewhere at
home, every manager has led a team to the playoffs, every manager
has an unblemished record of improving the teams that hire him.
</P>
<P>
   On average, when one of the five NL West managers has taken over
a club, it has moved up by 14 games and two places in the standings
in his first full season.
</P>
<P>
   After Leyland went from Florida to the Rockies last October,
former Marlin Gary Sheffield was quoted saying, ``He makes them
better by 10 games right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen games? Ten games? Can one man be worth that much? Can
five men?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't put much emphasis on that,'' Johnson said in the
Dodger Stadium dugout. ``The old thing is: Players win games,
managers lose 'em. I don't often think I won a game or lost a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Raul) Mondesi (for instance) wins it. If I give him a rest
that might have gotten him playing at a high level, maybe....''
</P>
<P>
   How much does a good manager matter?
</P>
<P>
   Leyland's next victory will be his 1,000th in the majors. Only
Tony La Russa, Bobby Cox and Joe Torre, among active managers, have
done that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may be the only guy who's (also) lost 1,000,'' said Leyland
(he isn't), ``So I don't pay too much attention to things like
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago the Marlins won the World Series. Last year
(after the salary dump), I lost 108 games. So I'm living proof that
it's not the manager.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which is a way of expressing the managers' mission
statement: Put the players in position to make the fullest use of
their individual talents.
</P>
<P>
   The net effect of having a division full of proven winners might
be this: They cancel each other out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going into the game, you don't feel superior to the other
manager and you don't feel inferior,'' Leyland said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Johnson, who is 11 wins away from 1,000: ``I know what
Jim's going to do. Jim knows what I'm going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   What they don't always know, less than two months after they
reported to spring training, is what their players are going to do.
So neither Johnson nor Leyland is in midseason form. Johnson thinks
it will take three or four turns through the rotation before his
pitchers' tendencies become recognizable. Namely _ the tipoffs that
his starters are tired.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Baltimore's Mike) Mussina, he'd start throwing more of the
soft stuff. Scotty (Erickson), he'd start muscling up, trying to
throw harder, and his ball would straighten out,'' Johnson said,
recalling his two seasons with Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn a lot. Like (Thursday) night with Carlos (Perez).''
</P>
<P>
   After that game was delayed 1 hour 25 minutes by rain, the
Dodgers left-hander threw just 56 pitches in the first six innings
while shutting out the Rockies. Then he gave up a three-run homer
to Todd Helton and the Dodgers were on their way to their first
loss of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I misjudged the effect of the delay,'' Johnson said.
``Because one of the signs of being tired is hanging a slider.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday afternoon, Johnson had to decide whether to put Sheffield
in the lineup a night after the left fielder came out of a game
with a pulled hip muscle. He kept him on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially in the cool weather, it's better to be on the safe
side,'' Johnson said. ``A guy comes in cold, he pulls something,
and !ital!then!off! I've cost the team 10 games.''

   SEATTLE _ Anybody who loves the marine environments and maritime
communities of the Pacific Coast should, albeit with a bit of pain,
read John Keeble's ``Out of the Channel: The Exxon-Valdez Oil Spill
in Prince William Sound.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is an investigative work, as well as a personal memoir,
of the greatest environmental disaster to hit the United States,
and of its yet-to-end aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Originally issued after the spill, ``Out of the Channel'' has
been updated to show how the spill set off a succession of
discouraging events. They include the high death rates in a killer
whale pod that resides in the pristine environment fouled by the
spill, the destructive clearcutting of forests by cash-strapped
native corporations, and a back-door deal between Exxon and a group
of seven Seattle-based seafood processors.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon quietly paid out a $70 million settlement for fishing
losses to the ``Seattle Seven.'' Secretly, however, the processors
agreed to apply for their share of any punitive damages awarded to
fishermen suing the oil giant. They would then hand the money back
to Exxon.
</P>
<P>
   A writing professor at Eastern Washington University, Keeble has
an eye for characters. Several are from the village of Cordova,
Alaska, whose fishermen fought against construction of the
Trans-Alaska Pipeline and warned that the Alyeska Pipeline Co. was
not prepared to deal with a spill.
</P>
<P>
   He relates a memorable prediction, delivered by phone to a
meeting in Valdez just six hours before the Exxon-Valdez went
aground on Bligh Reef. It came from Dr. Riki Ott, a marine
biologist and Cordova-based gillnetter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the high frequency of tankers into Port Valdez, the
increasing age and size of the tanker fleet, and the inability to
quickly contain and clean up an oil spill in the open water of
Alaska, fishermen feel that we are playing a game of Russian
roulette,'' Ott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When, not if, The Big One does occur and much or all of the
income from a fishing season is lost, compensation for processors,
support industries and local communities will be difficult if not
impossible to obtain,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The prediction has proven remarkably accurate. Exxon has used a
multiplicity of appeals to avoid paying a $5.3 billion civil
judgment awarded in 1994 by an Anchorage jury. In Cordova, the
largest cannery has closed. The value of a fishing license is
perhaps one-tenth of what it was before the spill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of the Channel'' is not a book of stereotypes. Keeble is
sympathetic to Capt. Joe Hazelwood, depicted as a drunken
ne'er-do-well even though he wasn't on the bridge at the time of
the accident. Keeble is scathing toward the U.S. Coast Guard for
its haphazard tracking of tankers and can't-happen-here attitude.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, Exxon has cleverly cut its losses from the '89
disaster. Its scientists claim that Prince William Sound has
completely recovered. Oil company apologists in the media have
taken to beating up Cordova, claiming the fishing village is
inhabited by people with nothing to do in the winter but watch
television and endlessly complain.
</P>
<P>
   Keeble presents a far truer picture. His Cordova is a town that
refuses to let Prince William Sound become the petroleum industry's
Potemkin Village, and dares to assert that a multinational company
must pay for the damage it did to a once-vibrant economy.

SHARKS BITE DUCKS

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It wasn't too long ago that the Anaehim Mighty
Ducks were talking about finishing as high as fourth in the Western
Conference. Then fifth became the goal as the Phoenix Coyotes
slowly pulled away.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday night the San Jose Sharks dropped the Ducks into
sixth place as they defeated Anaheim 4-1 before 17,174 at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   With possible home-ice advantage on the line, the Ducks ran into
a red-hot goalie in Steve Shields and allowed three third-period
goals.
</P>
<P>
   With the game tied 1-1, Shields somehow got his glove up to rob
Paul Kariya's backhander on a breakaway 1{ minute into the final
period, and got just enough of another Kariya shot moments later.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Sharks took the lead for good. Jeff Friesen easily
banged home Magnus Ragnarsson's pass at 2:19 thanks to a pick that
Vincent Damphousse set on Jason Marshall, preventing the Anaheim
defenseman from getting to the other side of the crease.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks put the game away with a goal by Owen Nolan at 9:30,
and Joe Murphy made it 4-1 at 11:50 on an outnumbered attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks came out strong, outshooting the Sharks 9-1 in the
first nine minutes of the game. But Shields, who is 9-0-2 in his
last 11 games, made a key save on Kariya's wide-open bid from the
right circle 1{ minutes into the game and another on Teemu Selanne
while Anaheim was on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Ducks' recent first-period woes caught up with them.
The Sharks outshot the Ducks 12-4 the balance of the period and
took a 1-0 lead at 18:22 when Alexander Korolyuk beat Kariya to the
net and scored a power play goal after the young San Jose winger
had drawn a hooking penalty on Fredrik Olausson.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim has been outscored 10-4 and outshot 46-26 in the first
periods of its last six games.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks got on the scoreboard when Tomas Sandstrom, in a rare
shift as a point man, one-timed Marty McInnis' pass by Shields to
tie the game 1-1 at 8:19. It was the Ducks' NHL-leading 81st power
play goal of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim nearly took the lead moments later on a broken play. The
puck took a wild bounce in front of the net and went directly to
Kariya in front of Shields. But the San Jose goalie made a great
glove save on Karya's backhander.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks got two scoring chances in the final minutes of the
period. Nolan couldn't get his stick on Damphousse's centering pass
with four minutes left and Friesen was stopped by Hebert with less
10 seconds remaining.

TRADITIONAL MEDICINE TAKES ON ALTERNATIVES 
</HEADLINE>
 MEDICINE-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN WEST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ Acupuncture, therapeutic massage, herbal
therapies and yoga: Have these alternative therapies earned their
place in mainstream American medicine?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Andrew Weil, arguing for their acceptance, and Dr. Arnold
Relman, opposing the mainstreaming of these ancient medical
treatments into modern medicine, duked it out in a landmark debate
Friday night at the University of Arizona College of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Weil, who is on the cutting edge of what is new in alternative
medicine, sparred on most points with Relman, editor and chief
emeritus at the New England School of Medicine, who is squarely
from the mainstream medical community.
</P>
<P>
   The debate came on the wings of a scathing article Relman wrote
in the ``New'' ``Republic,'' in which he referred to Weil's methods
as preposterous. At the debate, he said Weil's therapies are
``based on wildly implausible theories.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the debate took place at all is an acknowledgment
that the mainstream medical community is no longer ignoring
alternative medicine.
</P>
<P>
   With 42 percent of the public now using some sort of alternative
medical therapies, Weil and others have been pushing the nation's
medical schools to start requiring more medical students to learn
more about such things as acupuncture, herbal therapies and
hundreds of other therapies.
</P>
<P>
   Relman was appalled by that idea that medical students should be
taught alternative therapies.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching medical students how to do alternative therapies would
overthrow what medical schools teach, Relman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You believe first,'' he said to Weil. ``Then you try it. Maybe
it will work. We tell medical students to look for the data. To
look for objective evidence is how you train doctors to be
trustworthy or reliable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should we bring it into the medical mainstream when
evidence is scant? It is based on unproven therapies, contrary to
all that 20th-century medicine . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a time of breakthroughs and this won't help us make
those advances.''
</P>
<P>
   But Weil disagreed, saying that powerful social and economic
forces moving now are going to make alternative medicine even more
widely used and it would be better to have doctors trained than to
just let it happen haphazardly.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, he said, we may have HMOs deciding what type of
massage therapy is good.
</P>
<P>
   More corporations are also interested in health plans that
include alternative therapies but don't know how to sort out what
works and what is cost-effective, Weil said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the future not only because patients want it, but
practitioners do, too, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medical students want to know why they aren't learning about
herbal therapies,'' Weil said.
</P>
<P>
   Relman replied that the reason more doctors and medical students
are interested in it is that medical care is being delivered like a
business. They are unhappy spending less time with patients and may
be looking for a different livelihood themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first of what may be many discussions in the future
that could affect every person's health, and the two participants
hope to take the debate to other college campuses.
</P>
<P>
   In response to Relman's comment that sorting out what to teach
from all the various alternative therapies would be impossible,
Weil said he found his answer on a button that someone sent him:
``Those who say it can't be done should get of the way of people
doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Both spoke strongly Friday on their positions, said Dr. Chris
Shearer, residency director at Phoenix Baptist Hospital and
president of the Arizona Academy of Family Physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``One winner in this debate _ that there needs to be more
research about alternative therapies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And there is, although many say not enough considering the huge
growing interest in alternative medicines. The National Institutes
of Health is spending $40 million to $50 million on research on
alternative therapies this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Relman's responses were defined by traditional medicine,''
said Carol Feingold, faculty member of the UA College of Nursing.
``But I think people want more than that, they don't just want
treatment of disease. They want health care, but they want the
whole picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard L. Bourke, chairman of National Integrative Medicine, a
health care business in the Valley, said, ``Patients today are
looking to physicians for answers and aren't getting them. Doctors
don't have the training or the time.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of different terms used when people describe
alternative therapies.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown that most of those using alternative medicine
are women, and about 86 percent have at least some college, said
Rena Gordon, a medical geographer affiliated with both the
University of Arizona and Arizona State University. They are
middle-age and socially established. Many of them live in the West.
</P>
<P>
   They use alternative therapies in conjunction with conventional
medicine, she said. Only 4 percent use alternative medicine
exclusively but disclosure is low. No one knows how many people go
to alternative healers because they don't talk about it, especially
with their family physician.
</P>
<P>
   Because Weil's clinic at UA is a teaching clinic, it is unable
to accommodate large numbers of patients. There is a waiting list
of several hundred and at least several months to be seen. The
clinic is set up as a self-pay program because most HMOs don't
reimburse.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, individuals interested in a place on the waiting
list may call 1-(520)-694-6555. &QL;

MCCAIN'S STAND ON KOSOVO CARRIES RISKS
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (ANALYSIS) 
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John McCain's presidential prospects were
elevated by his early advocacy for a U.S. ground forces option in
Kosovo, but his challenge is to keep momentum from disappearing be
fore it begins to translate into campaign donations and improved
poll numbers.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's politically risky Kosovo position _ declaring that the
U.S. must be prepared for ground troops and casualties _ has
distinguished him from a GOP field of presiden tial candidates who
by comparison have seemed cautious. The popular perception is that
McCain, largely through his frequent television ap pearances on
Kosovo, has begun to leapfrog over some of the Republi can
presidential contenders in the middle of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   Now McCain finds himself in the forefront of a volatile
foreign-policy debate that certainly could heighten his White House
chances, but it could also damage them considera bly.
</P>
<P>
   After seizing the mantle of Ko sovo leadership, McCain is
planning several moves next week, not with out some risk, that are
likely to keep him out front. In the most important of those moves,
McCain is expected to encourage Senate Republican and Democratic
leaders to support a resolution on how the U.S. should proceed in
the complicated Balkan crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, not yet written, would likely endorse the use of
ground forces, if they were deemed necessary by the Clinton
administra tion.
</P>
<P>
   McCain just returned from meet ings in Belgium with NATO allies.
In a letter signed Friday, McCain and eight other lawmakers on the
trip encouraged President Clinton to urge NATO to plan for
additional military missions, including the use of ground forces if
needed to reverse ``genocidal actions'' against Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The letter said NATO's mission of deterring Yugoslav President
Slo bodan Milosevic and his military capability could require
``many more weeks or months to succeed,'' and it warned that ``the
American public also needs to be better prepared for the likelihood
of alli ance casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain is expected to lay out his latest Kosovo thinking at a
speech Tuesday to the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, a Wash ington think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, McCain's initial Ko sovo expressions, like a
double-word score in Scrabble, have man aged to achieve two goals
simulta neously.
</P>
<P>
   By indefinitely postponing his presidential announcement tour be
cause of Kosovo, McCain high lighted his principal campaign theme
that he can rise above politics when the national interest is at
stake.
</P>
<P>
   And his early call not to rule out ground forces illuminated his
per sistent criticism of the White House for seeming indecisive on
this and other foreign-policy matters.
</P>
<P>
   A former prisoner of war in Vietnam, McCain has traditionally
been hesitant about committing U.S. troops overseas with no
definitive end in sight. In Bosnia, for example, McCain long
opposed calling in American pilots.
</P>
<P>
   McCain had doubts about Presi dent Clinton's Kosovo policy, too,
but said that once the mission was under way, it was incumbent upon
the United States to do anything it could to win.
</P>
<P>
   McCain ``is, I think literally the only major political figure
in either party who is forthrightly addressing the issue and
providing real leader ship,'' said Mike Hellon, a member of the
Republican National Commit tee from Arizona. ``I have to tell you,
I think our own guys (in the GOP) haven't fared much better'' than
the Democrats, Hellon said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's aides said it was too early to assess any potential
political gain from his position on Kosovo because there is
traditionally a ``lag'' separating events from fund-raising and
poll numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what this will do is give McCain a temporary boost,
because it will make more people think about him,'' said Arthur
Miller, a University of Iowa political scien tist. ``But if this
basically recedes from the forefront, I have a feeling that it's
hard to speak out on foreign-policy matters when there isn't
something urgent.''
</P>
<P>
   But for now McCain is ubiqui tous, appearing on as many as seven
national television programs in a day.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Opinsky, spokesman for McCain's presidential exploratory
committee, said Friday that the senator has not been consulting his
campaign advisers before adopting positions on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strategic interests of Amer ica are far more important to
him than his own political short-term desires,'' Opinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain faces potential political hazards in supporting a mission
that could result in an untold number of U.S. casualties and that
many of his Republican colleagues consider ill-defined.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republican senators are torn over Kosovo, Sen. Jon Kyl,
R-Ariz., said in a recent interview,
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a very conflicted Republican (caucus) here which
supports NATO, which is as con cerned about humanitarian issues as
anybody, and which is not afraid to use American force,
particularly against dictators like Milosevic,'' Kyl said.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl added that he and other leading GOP senators were ``signif
icantly influenced'' by a private briefing they received before the
airstrikes in which former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger said
he could not support the mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``His point was that, `Yes, if you don't do anything, there will
be a black eye for NATO because the threat was made,' '' Kyl said.
``But he balances that against the fact there is no national
security interest of the United States of any signifi cance. The
fact that you have a bad guy like Milosevic is not a reason to go
to war, because you've got a lot of bad guys around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Kyl said, ``Kissinger believes, as do I, that this
adminis tration never had a good plan about how to achieve its
objectives, and in fact, the objectives have been changing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyl, unlike McCain, voted last month against authorizing Clinton
to initiate military operations in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But once the mission started, Kyl said that he, like McCain,
wanted to ensure the troops be given every chance to succeed. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bob Thomas, a stocky, amiable 29-year-old chef,
stands in front of a green upholstered wall, a spotlight
illuminating his face and blue sweatshirt while a video camera
rolls.
</P>
<P>
   A mock television hostess welcomes him to ``the show'' and says,
``Bob, tell us about your new computerized restaurant guide.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's really fun to use,'' Thomas replies through a
mile-wide grin. ``You can find any kind of restaurant you want in
Boston, without having to push a single button.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the videotape is played back.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK. OK. That's good, but there are a few things to keep in
mind,'' said David Kratz, president of Kratz &AMP; Jensen Inc., a New
York public relations firm. ``One, take your hands off your hips
and use them to gesture; two, be more enthusiastic and passionate.
Make friends with the host: `Hi, Nicole, it's so nice to be here
with you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kratz belongs to the fast-growing field of chef publicists,
behind-the-scenes operatives who pump the bellows for hot and
want-to-be-hot kitchen celebrities. As well-known culinary figures
spend less time in the kitchen and more in front of cameras or on
book tours, publicists help them secure all sorts of
extracurricular activities, from kitchen-ware endorsements to
consulting, book writing and selling products (including
themselves) on Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Today's hot chef is the multimedia chef. ``When you get a job as
a chef, or a pastry chef, you start at a certain salary,''
explained Jacques Torres, the pastry chef at Le Cirque 2000 in
Manhattan. ``That salary will go up gradually; but if you really
want to make a better living, you have to get into consulting,
books, television and all of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Through these activities, high-profile chefs, many of whom own
their restaurants, can easily double or triple their basic incomes,
which usually run around $70,000 to $100,000 in major cities. It
can also give their restaurants a lift, even when the chef is
hundreds of miles away shooting an ad for imported mustard.
</P>
<P>
   In its March issue, Forbes magazine for the first time included
five chefs among its ``Celebrity 100,'' the highest-paid and most
influential people in various professions. Leading the pack was
Wolfgang Puck, the gastronomic mahatma whose restaurant empire
spans the country and who also has a line of frozen foods. Puck's
income for 1998 was estimated at $10.5 million, followed by Emeril
Lagasse, the television sensation from New Orleans, at $2.4
million; Jean-Georges Vongerichten of New York ($2.1 million);
Nobuyuki Matsuhisa of Los Angeles and Manhattan ($750,000); and
Daniel Boulud, also of Manhattan ($700,000). All have at least one
publicist behind them.
</P>
<P>
   Torres has been garnering more press than the pinot noir grape
in recent years, partly owing to the efforts of his three
publicist-collaborators, Kris Kruid, Fern Berman and Tina Wright.
Torres is planning his second television series, has written two
cookbooks, has a Web site, lectures at the French Culinary
Institute in Manhattan and has been featured in countless magazine
and newspaper articles.
</P>
<P>
   Joachim Splichal, a virtual unknown when he was the chef at Max
au Triangle in Los Angeles in 1983, received prodigious media
coverage, much of it organized by his wife, Christine. With his
suddenly heightened profile, Splichal began planning his own
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we were well-known, it was easier to raise money,'' he
explained. In 1989, with $650,000, he opened Patina on modish
Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles. Today he owns 13 restaurants,
consults for Windstar Cruises, runs a catering business, has
developed the commissary for 20th Century Fox, and is even, he
said, ``talking to the archdiocese of Los Angeles to develop food
service for their new cathedral.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the early 1980s, most chefs were cave dwellers in their
sweltering kitchens, and diners had little chance of, or interest
in, meeting them. If a publicity offer came their way, they handled
it themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Chef publicists, who used to mainly send out news releases and
pitch stories to reporters, today are much more involved with their
clients' careers. They coach chefs on how to comport themselves in
interviews, send them to high-profile charity and industry events,
help them with book ideas, search out corporate endorsements, help
train restaurant staffs and even act as in-house critics. The tab?
From $2,000 to $6,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Kratz &AMP; Jensen has offices in New York, San Francisco, Chicago
and Los Angeles, with 50 employees and billings in excess of $6
million. It handles a diverse range of clients, from celebrities to
chief executives; chefs and restaurants represent about 30 percent
of its business.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a chef is on TV, it's not about food, it's about
entertaining,'' said Lou Ekus, a media trainer in Greenfield,
Mass., who has prepped culinary luminaries like Lagasse, Stephan
Pyles of Dallas and Bobby Flay of New York. Ekus charges $3,000
plus expenses for a two-day seminar.
</P>
<P>
   The chef-publicist business is dominated by individuals (mostly
women) who have a handful of clients they work with intensively.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Tamara Wilson, an independent publicist in Seattle,
represents a half-dozen restaurants in the city, including the
Painted Table, Tulio and Stars Bar and Dining, owned by Jeremiah
Tower, who also owns Stars restaurant in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   One recent publicity coup was arranging a fishing trip to the
Copper River in Alaska for Tower and Hubert Trimbach, a wine maker
from Alsace. ``It was something different, and we got a lot of
press,'' Ms. Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   The publicists still spend a lot of time, of course, courting
the media _ through lunches, news releases and even gifts like
chocolate truffles at Easter. While some journalists grumble that
publicists overwhelm them with a Vesuvius of inconsequential
material, many say they can be useful.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative to hiring a publicist is mounting a sustained
advertising campaign, something most restaurants cannot afford. A
substantial advertising effort costs an estimated 2 to 3 percent of
gross income. When a publicist books a chef on television or has
him written up in the print media, the attention is not only more
credible but can be less expensive in the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   A high-profile chef, though, can be a double-edged sword for a
restaurant. In general, the more renowned a chef becomes, the more
control or equity he wants. Often, that results in the chef's
leaving for a better offer, or opening his own place.

   Dan Sachs opened Spruce restaurant in Chicago three years ago to
widespread plaudits for his chef, Keith Luce. Even though Luce had
a limited partnership in the restaurant, he decided last July to
leave for the Restaurant at Little Nell, a resort in Aspen, Colo.
``Publicity definitely had a role in my decision,'' Luce explained.
``The more status you get from the media, the better the offers
that come along.''
</P>
<P>
   For many chefs, the ultimate is turning themselves into a brand,
which often leads to corporate endorsements for everything from
kitchen equipment, chefs' attire and tableware to the likes of the
National Pork Products Council, Plugra Butter, Cervena Venison, and
Foods From Spain. Airlines also hire celebrity chefs to develop
menus.
</P>
<P>
   Cervena, the American marketing arm for New Zealand venison,
took on 15 leading chefs to publicize the product nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worked very well for everybody for six years,'' said Mary
Anne Harmon, the company's marketing manager until the program
ended in March. ``We had a product that nobody was doing anything
with, so we wanted to gain credibility with a core group of
influential chefs.''
</P>
<P>
   The chefs, among them Kevin Rathbun of Nava restaurant in
Atlanta, David Holben of the Riviera in Dallas, and Charlie Palmer
of Aureole in New York, were paid only a few thousand dollars a
year for public appearances. But the important currency was in
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``In return for being in the program, they received a lot of
media exposure,'' Ms. Harmon said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, chefs and publicists say it is difficult to quantify
the precise effects of public relations versus advertising. Some
successful chefs and restaurants eschew publicists, saying they can
do the job better themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got into business, I believed that the surest way
to stay out of the press was to have someone sending massive
mailings of packets and letters out,'' explained Danny Meyer, an
owner-partner in four successful Manhattan restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as chefs increasingly become celebrities in their own
right, they are expecting to be treated like stars, too. ``Chefs
have egos like everybody else,'' said Margie Korshak, a Chicago
publicist. ``In their restaurants they have always courted VIPs;
now they want to be one.''

<P>
   VANCOUVER, B.C. _ Dr. Jekyll one night. Mr. Hyde the next.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four hours after pulling off an impressive upset of the
Portland Trail Blazers, the Sonics were slapped with an equally
stunning 98-93 loss by the Vancouver Grizzlies Friday night at GM
Place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough loss,'' Sonics coach Paul Westphal said after his
team had once again fallen below .500 at 17-18. ``But give
Vancouver some credit. They made some plays down the stretch, and
we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, and somehow, the Sonics were in it at the frenzied end.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of 3-point baskets by Dale Ellis trimmed the Grizzlies'
lead to 90-88 with 1:35 remaining. But after Vin Baker rebounded a
rare missed shot by the Grizzlies' Shareef Abdur-Rahim, Gary Payton
threw the ball away.
</P>
<P>
   But the clincher came with 16.9 points remaining. Just when it
appeared the Sonics had made a defensive stop and would get the
ball with the Grizzlies clinging to a 92-90 lead, Terry Dehere
leaned around Ellis and tossed in a 3-pointer as the shot-clock
expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've hit a lot of big shots,'' Dehere, a 6-foot-4 guard, said
of his only basket in the game. ``This is definitely a big shot,
where we can win a close game down the stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   The flip side was the Sonics losing another close game down the
stretch to a team they should have, and could have, beaten.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how our season has gone,'' guard Hersey Hawkins said.
``It's been crazy bounces, one after the other. We had the Dehere
thing, the rebound, loose balls. It doesn't matter. For some reason
we haven't been able to come up with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially on the road, where the Sonics are now 4-13 entering
tomorrow's game against the Lakers in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   It was only the seventh win of the season for the Grizzlies, who
appeared as if they would be blown off their own court early in the
first quarter as Seattle stormed to a 19-6 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Grizzlies seemed to get more energized before a
sellout crowd of 19,193 as the Sonics struggled with their shooting
all evening.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics never did have an answer for Abdur-Rahim, who scored
28 points, grabbed 11 rebounds and blocked three shots. Equally
impressive and effective was rookie Felipe Lopez, who scored 21
points and also had 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics, meanwhile, shot 38.6 percent for the game.
</P>
<P>
   Payton finished with just 13 points, nine below his average, and
was 4 of 17 from the field. Detlef Schrempf was 2 of 11 from the
field and scored just 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a couple of guys we count on come up firing blanks most
of the game,'' Westphal said.
</P>
<P>
   Payton, at least, had an excuse. He was bothered during the game
by a sore back, but still managed to distribute 12 assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary is pretty stiff. His back was hurting him real bad
tonight,'' Westphal said. ``He won't say it, but I'll say it.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker had his second strong outing since returning from a
10-game absence because of a torn ligament in his right thumb. He
scored 15 points and had 11 rebounds. Ellis led the Sonics with 20
points and Hawkins had 17.
</P>
<P>
   But down the stretch, the Grizzlies repeatedly beat the Sonics
down the court, to the basket and to almost every loose ball.
</P>
<P>
   A ram-and-jam example came in the third quarter when the younger
Grizzlies outhustled the Sonics to take the lead and stretch it to
five points, 69-64. Cherokee Parks (two), Tony Massenburg and
Abdur-Rahim each had a hoop-rattling slam to ignite the surge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little afraid at the beginning,'' Lopez said. ``We
went down 13-2, but we just came back like we've been doing all
this time. We did our job and stepped up and hit big shots.''
</P>
<P>
   The Grizzlies' rim-rattling rally left Westphal frayed and still
searching for a remedy to the inconsistency that ails his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of big loose balls went their way. A couple of
buzzer-beaters went their way. We had a couple of turnovers,''
Westphal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all adds up to a great win for them, a bad loss for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Make that another bad loss.

   KOSOVO-MILITARY (Washington) _ Four days after NATO approved the
deployment of two dozen American Apache helicopter gunships to
attack Yugoslav tanks, frustrated NATO and Pentagon officials now
estimate that it could take a month before the helicopters are
available to fly into Kosovo. By Steven Lee Myers. With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-HUNGER (Washington) _ About 700,000 ethnic Albanians have
been uprooted from their homes by the Yugoslavs and are still in
Kosovo facing the risk of famine as food stocks quickly dwindle,
administration officials said Friday. Officials have considered air
drops of food but rejected the idea as too dangerous for NATO
pilots, who would have to fly at low levels and risk being hit by
Yugoslav ground fire, an official said. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-RUSSIA (Moscow) _ President Boris Yeltsin did not order
Russian nuclear missiles to be retargeted at NATO countries taking
part in the bombing of Yugoslavia. Nor did he formally endorse the
joining together of Russia, Belarus and Yugoslavia in a
geographically awkward Slavic union. But at a meeting Friday with
Gennadi Seleznyov, the Communist who is speaker of the Russian
Parliament's lower house, he unmistakably warned the West not to
push Russia into another war in the Balkans. By Celestine Bohlen.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-RUGOVA (Undated) _ or most of the last ten years,
Slobodan Milosevic, as the main generator of aroused Serbian
nationalism, has been trying to ignore Ibrahim Rugova, the 53 year
old literary historian who until recently was the unquestioned
leader of Kosovo's Albanians. But now, after the NATO attacks on
Yugoslavia and the forced flight of Albanians from Kosovo,
President Milosevic has turned to the adversary he spurned for so
long, as if acknowledging him as a suitable partner for building a
peace. By Michael T. Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-SURVEIL (Brussels) _ Three days after Serbian troops
closed border crossing points from Kosovo into Macedonia and
Albania, NATO reconnaissance planes have failed to locate any of
the tens of thousands of refugees who were turned back from the
frontier. By Craig R. Whitney. With photo.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-RELIEF (Washington) _ The new partnership between NATO
and the U.N. refugee organization is bringing supplies and shelter
to hundreds of thousands who have fled Kosovo, but some fear it is
straining the traditional neutrality of aid groups. by working so
closely with one side's military in an ongoing assault, the U.N.
refugee organization may have crossed the line that allows relief
organizations to care fo the victims of both sides of a conflict,
some governments and aid organizations said. By Elizabeth Becker.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-NATO (Brussels) _ The United States has quietly warned
Russia against providing military intelligence or assistance to
Belgrade, senior Western officials said Friday. The confidential
warning follows bitter complaints from Moscow about NATO's
airstrikes. Evidence that Russia was helping Belgrade would
undermine public support in the West for loans to Russia. By
Michael Gordon.

   CHINA-U.S.-TRADE (Washington) _ A look at why the WTO deal
didn't happen, and whether it had more to do with Congress, labor
or the Chinese. By David E. Sanger. With photo.
</P>
<P>
   VENEZUELA-PRESIDENT (Caracas, Venezuela) _ To the adoring,
impoverished masses who catapulted him to power, Hugo Chavez Frias
is El Comandante, their protector and benefactor, the bold leader
who will wipe out 40 years of inequality and corruption and
redirect this country's enormous oil wealth to better their lives.
To his opponents, the 44-year-old former army paratrooper who is
Venezuela's new president represents something unsettling, even
dangerous. By Larry Rohter.

<P>
   POLICE-CHIEFS (Washington) _ Police chiefs meeting here to

   SHIPYARD-STRIKE (Newport News, Va.) _ Seething about what they
called stingy wages and pensions, more than 8,000 workers at
Newport News Shipbuilding are on strike in one of the largest
walkouts of this decade. By Steven Greenhouse. With photo.
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIUM-BABIES (New York) _ For those who somehow missed the
media hype and the water-cooler jokes, Friday night was the night
that doctors and statisticians had calculated would be the
equivalent of a rare fertility eclipse. It offered the chance to
produce the ultimate millennial accessory, a child born on Jan. 1,
2000. By David W. Chen.
</P>
<P>
   ABORTION-DOCTOR (New York) _ Nearly six months after a Buffalo,
N.Y., area doctor who performed abortions was shot to death at home
by a rifle-wielding sniper, law enforcement authorities reported on
Friday that they had found a rifle in woods behind the doctor's
house in Amherst, N.Y. While the finding of the rifle appeared to
be the biggest break in the case so far, it raised questions among
friends and relatives of Dr. Barnett Slepian as to why local police
and the FBI had not used high-technology methods to locate the
rifle much sooner. By Joseph Berger.

   THRIFT-SUIT (Washington) _ A federal judge will order the
government to pay nearly $909 million to a California thrift that
nearly went bankrupt after Congress and the Bush administration
imposed tougher accounting changes on the industry a decade ago.
The decision awarded to Glendale Federal Bank one of the largest
claims ever assessed against the federal government and is
significant for the legal precedent it may set for the more than
120 other similar cases filed by existing and moribund savings
associations and their shareholders. By Stephen Labaton. With

   COMPAQ-EARNINGS (Undated) _ Compaq Computer Corp. disclosed that
first-quarter earnings would be disappointing, in part because of
price-cutting throughout the industry. By Saul Hansell.
</P>
<P>
   CELEBRITY-CHEFS (Undated) _ Today's hot chef is a multimedia
chef. And as well-known culinary figures spend less time in the
kitchen and more in front of cameras or on book tours, publicists
help them secure all sorts of extracurricular activities, from
kitchenware endorsements to consulting, book writing and selling
products (including themselves) on Web sites. By Bryan Miller. With

</P>
<P>
   HONGKONG-TRADE (Hong Kong) _ For China, which has spent years
trying to claw its way into the world's club of trading nations,
the benefits of such an expanded reach and strong connections are
clear. But for Hong Kong, which has thrived as a middleman between
China's closed markets and the outside world, the possibility of a
more open China raises hard questions about the future. By Mark
Landler.
</P>
<P>
   BROKER-GUILTY (New York) _ The Manhattan district attorney
announced Friday that Pasquale D'Onofrio, a former stockbroker at
Duke &AMP; Co., a defunct New York brokerage firm, pleaded guilty to

<P>
   LEWIS-COLUMN (London) _ NATO now has three irreducible war aims:
the removal of all Serbian military, paramilitary and police forces
from Kosovo; the return of all the ethnic Albanian refugees, and
their care and protection by an international force. In Britain, as
in the United States, Serbian atrocities have brought public
opinion solidly behind those objectives. But the leaders of NATO
are not so clear in stating them. By Anthony Lewis.

   SINGER-BIOETHICS (Undated) _ Not since 1940 when City College
tried to hire an atheist and advocate of free love, Bertrand
Russell, has the appointment of an academic philosopher by an
American university created such an uproar. The choice of Peter
Singer, a world renowned animal rights advocate, for a chair in
bioethics at Princeton University's Center for Human Values, has
jolted this genteel college town as well as the field of bioethics.
Singer has defended, in certain circumstances, euthanasia, not only

HARRIS IS UNLIKELY STAR AS NETS DEFEAT RAPTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Keith Van Horn and Stephon Marbury were
the likely saviors. Van Horn had used his crossover dribble and
athleticism to work the former Knicks warrior Charles Oakley to
death. And Marbury, the brazen point guard, is always looking to
deliver in the fourth quarter. But Friday night, the unusual
happened at Continental Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Lucious Harris, who has battled injury and ineffectiveness all
season, starred for the Nets. Burying three long jump shots and
making 4 of 4 free throws over the last eight minutes, the Nets'
shy eighth man led them to their fifth victory in six games, 106-99
over the Toronto Raptors.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-5-inch shooting guard did not enter the game with
such high aspirations. After spending a couple of weeks on the
injured list with a bulging disk in his back, Harris, who finished
with a season-high 17 points, was happy just to be on the floor,
let alone throwing in big shots in the critical moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good to be on the court,'' said Harris, who averages
just under 5 points and 15 minutes a game. ``I've been the
forgotten man for a while with my back injury. But I worked hard
and stayed with it, and tonight I showed what I can do on the
court.''
</P>
<P>
   While it is all but impossible for the Nets (10-25) to earn a
spot in the post-season, the game was not without playoff
implications. Toronto, riding the lovely mix of veteran leadership
(Oakley and Kevin Willis) and youthful explosiveness (Vince Carter
and Tracy McGrady) to its best season, entered the Meadowlands in
the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference,
one-half game ahead of the Knicks. But the loss, combined with the
Knicks' victory over the Atlanta Hawks, dropped the Raptors to
18-17 and moved the Knicks (19-17) back into a playoff slot.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets were certainly not trying to do the Knicks a favor. In
fact, they will attempt to push the storied franchise that
perpetually overshadows them back out of contention Sunday when the
geographic rivals meet at 3 p.m. at Continental Arena.
</P>
<P>
   That one will be intriguing for numerous reasons: the Knicks,
despite Friday's impressive victory, seem to be on the verge of
self-destruction, while the Nets, far removed from their
nightmarish start, are playing some of the finest ball in the East,
and Marbury, the Brooklyn native whom the Knicks coveted, will play
against his hometown team for the first time since joining the
Nets.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, however, would not add to the drama surrounding the
game with a boastful comment Friday night. ``I'm not going to be on
the back page,'' Marbury said, referring to the New York tabloid
newspapers. ``It's just another game. ''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the Nets, having starved for most of the season, are
hungry for any victory they can get, be it over the Knicks or the
Los Angeles Clippers. They are showing as much by playing with fire
and intensity whenever they take the court.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, they combined brute strength and crafty positioning
under the backboards _ they outrebounded Toronto, the league's
fourth-best rebounding team, by 52-42 _ with deftness in transition
to grab an 18-point lead, 77-59, late in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn and Marbury had been dazzling, hooking up in the first
quarter for a resounding alley-oop slam on a pass that Marbury
threw from beyond the halfcourt line. Van Horn led the Nets to a
32-21 advantage in the third quarter by scoring 16 of his game-high
30 points. Marbury, who scored 20 points, had all nine of his
assists in the first three periods.
</P>
<P>
   The Raptors' only answer to the Nets' show was the rookie
Carter, who scored 20 of his 26 points in the first half on jump
shots and wicked moves to the basket. But with the reserve guard
Dee Brown hitting three of his four 3-pointers in the final 13
minutes, Toronto pulled within 90-87 with three minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Harris, who had already made a 20-foot jumper and
assisted Marbury on a nice fast-break dunk in the quarter, hit a 21
footer to push the Nets' lead back to 5 points. Again, Toronto
pulled within 3 on a driving layin by McGrady. And again, Harris
answered with a 20-footer. The Raptors pulled within 3 points twice
more in the final minute, only to have Harris hit four free throws
to keep them at bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stephon said to me, `Just be ready to shoot the ball and when
it comes, don't hesitate,' '' Harris said. ``And I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   REBOUNDS
</P>
<P>
   The Nets have been in contact with the agent JIMMY SEXTON
concerning DAVID VAUGHN, a forward who played 15 games for the Nets
last season. &QL;

MARINERS NEED HOT TEAM TO WARM FANS IN NEW BALLPARK

<P>
   SEATTLE _ Walking into the Kingdome nearing twilight Friday, the
new ballyard looming, something occurred to me:
</P>
<P>
   Man, was it cold.
</P>
<P>
   OK, not a great scoop. But as excuses go, it's a valid one most
April evenings in Seattle for staying inside.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the new ballpark is not inside. It's outside, of
all places.
</P>
<P>
   True, it has a gargantuan carport. But underneath, no heaters.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that always the case these days when you spend $517
million? Go cheap, and you get what you pay for.
</P>
<P>
   As a factor in the playing of baseball, cold is nothing compared
to rain. Unless, of course, one makes a living hitting home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you think Albert Belle left Chicago?'' Ken Griffey Jr.
asked in his usual mischievous manner before the game.
</P>
<P>
   Becoming baseball's highest-paid player in 1999 ($11.9 million)
might have something to do with it. But Griffey would like to think
Belle's motivation included Camden Yards' shorter fences and
Baltimore's warmer springs.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey holds fast to the baseball belief that cold, heavy air
retards the flight of the ball. So if Friday night's Kingdome game
against Oakland had been held next door, the game definitely would
have been retarded, longball-wise.
</P>
<P>
   And if the Mariners' thick-armed offense is retarded, what would
be the point of sitting in 38 degrees for three hours?
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what will happen to the ball over there,''
Griffey said of the new digs, ``but if the ball doesn't go, then
what?''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey chuckled at the prospect of bringing in the new park's
fences yet again. He speculated that in the space between the
fences and the bleachers, the Mariners can create a big picnic and
party area.
</P>
<P>
   Or, if moving the fences means yet another unexpected expense
for a stadium that may yet out-price the Kennedy Space Center, the
Mariners could simply be remade into a pitching-dominant team. That
shouldn't take any longer than paying off the stadium bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the ball doesn't carry,'' Griffey said, ``how many
(big-hitting) free agents are you going to attract here?''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's musings about the new park came amid some curiosity
about the attendance numbers of the infant season. After a 13-year
low of 51,656 for an opening night, crowds of 20,435 and 21,050
finished out the White Sox series. Friday's game against the A's
drew 24,823, and the pre-sale for Saturday's annual Bat Night
promotion, normally a crowd in the 45,000 range, is about 28,000.
</P>
<P>
   Most ominous is that sales of season tickets, including the new
park, are 20,500, just a thousand more than the Kingdome
full-season record. The Mariners planned to cut off season ticket
sales at 24,000, but apparently the region's baseball fans saved
them the trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the obvious factors of a young season and unglamorous
opposition, the Mariners did little in the run-up to engender a
buzz, new yard notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was our big story?'' Griffey asked in his series of
self-answering questions. ``Will Griffey and A-Rod re-sign?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, almost the entire winter discussion of the Mariners,
with the notable exception of Jay Buhner's remarkable
rehabilitation from elbow surgery, was about what they can't,
couldn't or won't do. Not exactly the kind of thing to set a
marquee ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariner owners' disengagement from baseball's economic
battles, no matter how well-reasoned, has cast something of a pall.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 strategy thus far appears to rely exclusively on the
undeniable appeal of blue skies and green grass. The problem is the
honeymoon for the park may be far briefer than many imagined if
fans are allowed to spend their time the way the Mariner bosses
spent theirs _ coming up with reasons to disengage.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) Don't get attached to Griffey; he'll be gone. Don't
get attached to A-Rod; he'll be gone. Mariner pitchers are too old
and too young. Tickets are too expensive. There's no parking. It's
too cold. It's too hot (OK, the last one was a reach). (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   The tendency among some fans to avoid potentially futile
emotional investment is part of why Griffey called Mariner
president Chuck Armstrong in the off-season to suggest trading top
pitching prospect Ryan Anderson (``Space Needle,'' Griffey calls
him) for Roger Clemens, who subsequently went from the Blue Jays to
the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Said Griffey: ``Imagine what people would be saying about us if
we had Clemens.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Mariners have chosen rivets over Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the new park will be magnificent. But unless there is a
compelling team cavorting on its lawn, the possibility looms larger
that the region's baseball fans could let novelty wear thin
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Remember how a succession of Mariner owners and execs insisted
that baseball would never work in an ugly indoor park during
gorgeous Seattle summers?
</P>
<P>
   That would be baffling news to the 8.4 million Mariner fans who
attended Kingdome games the last three years. The park, it would
seem, comes in second to the play.
</P>
<P>
   For $517 million, one would think they had thought of
everything.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ For much of last summer, Mike Piazza felt he was
pressing every time at bat.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza would get one chance a game, if that, with runners in
scoring position. At the beginning of his tenure with the Mets, he
failed so often that the fans at Shea Stadium began to shower him
with boos.
</P>
<P>
   Those must seem like ancient times to Piazza. It seems as if
every time he comes up now, someone is on base. ``The key is that
guys are out there to drive in,'' Piazza said.
</P>
<P>
   The All-Star catcher drove in five runs Friday night to lead the
Mets and Masato Yoshii to a 10-3 defeat of the Montreal Expos, a
team that has bedeviled them in the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   Three of those runs batted in came during the Mets' four-run
first inning, when Piazza belted a hanging slider from Mike Thurman
over a cluster of television cameras beyond the center-field fence.
Through the first five games of the season, Piazza has had seven
at-bats with runners in scoring position. After going 2 for 2 in
such situations Friday, Piazza is 4 for 7 (.571) with two home runs
and seven r.b.i.
</P>
<P>
   One day after a frustrating loss here, everything was right
again in the Mets' world. Each member of the infield made at least
one terrific play on defense. Yoshii allowed two home runs, but
they were not costly, and he lasted seven innings. Even more
important, the Mets gave their starter something he rarely had last
season: runs to work with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this is the start of something new,'' Manager Bobby
Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Mets center fielder Brian McRae provided a
critique of the improving Expos, who were tough on the Mets last
season and again on Thursday. Montreal was 8-4 against the Mets
last year, which helped knock them out of a post-season berth. The
Expos also were 6-6 against the Atlanta Braves, the National League
East's champions, and 51-87 against everyone else. ``When they play
against us and the Braves, they play their best ball,'' McRae said.
``But they're not consistent. We get up for every game. Today will
be a different test.''
</P>
<P>
   Expos Manager Felipe Alou said before the game that he did not
believe his team was ready to contend, and added that the biggest
questions surrounding Montreal involved its starting pitching. One
of those question marks, Thurman, was pounded by the Mets on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Thurman went to a 3-2 count on the first three batters he faced,
walking all three. Only two runners were on base for Piazza, the
cleanup hitter, because the rookie catcher Michael Barrett had
thrown out Rickey Henderson on an attempted steal. That proved a
break for the Expos as Piazza launched an 0-1 pitch for a homer to
center field.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Robin Ventura then followed with a shot over the
fence in right to give the Mets back-to-back home runs and a 4-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   With Yoshii on the mound, it was not the safest of margins.
Yoshii had been so shaky this spring that the Mets had spent almost
two weeks preceding the regular season trying to shore up their
starting rotation. And when Barrett hit a two-run home run to
center with one out in the second, the Mets' lead was cut to 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Two innings later, it was 4-3, after Montreal's right fielder,
Vladimir Guerrero, launched a shot that cleared the bleachers in
left.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets loaded the bases for Piazza with one out in the fifth.
The rookie right-hander J. D. Smart came on in relief of Thurman.
Piazza greeted Smart with a two-run single to give him five runs
batted in on the night, his most as a Met. Ventura followed with a
run-scoring groundout, and the Mets were able to coast the rest of
the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``With our lineup, we could have guys on a lot,'' Ventura said.
``And that's what you want with Mike coming to the plate. You want
guys to be on so you can't pitch around him.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Piazza has made it hard for anybody to pitch to him,
too.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   TOM SEAVER will throw out the ceremonial first pitch at the
Mets' home opener on Monday.

ANKLE IS NOT ANGELS' ACHILLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's edition of The Sporting Muse, limping a bit in support
of Mo Vaughn: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While everyone in Anaheim holds their breath waiting for Mo
Vaughn's ankle to heal, let's take a minute to ask if Mo would have
been any help during losses Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels allowed nine runs in each game. Until ailing Chuck
Finley went six innings Friday at Texas, a starter had yet to last
five innings. Tim Belcher and Ken Hill went 4fr 1/3 and Steve
Sparks four Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, Vaughn may be the clubhouse catalyst everyone
expected him to be, and he may shake off his ankle injury and post
numbers like .300, 30 and 100. But he can't pitch, and that's where
the team has unfortunately been weakest since Finley, Jim Abbott
and Mark Langston won 55 games between them.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have not had a pitcher win 16 games or more since
1993. The club has been modestly succeeding despite having failed
to produce a quality, dependable pitcher from its system since the
mid-80s, when Finley and Kirk McCaskill emerged. You can't say the
Angels developed Abbott since he went from college and the Olympics
to the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, one of the most overlooked effects of inconsistent
pitching is the energy it demands of the lineup to always produce.
Most teams can feel secure that a four-run inning in the fourth or
fifth will stand up. Not the Angels. The only time they ever feel
safe is when Troy Percival is on the mound, and he may not get a
lot of save opportunities. ...
</P>
<P>
   I know Arizona manager Buck Showalter is supposed to have a
brilliant mind. But if I'm managing a team and the opposing catcher
is coming off surgery, like Todd Hundley, I run until he proves he
can make the throw without his arm breaking into pieces. ...
</P>
<P>
   The D-Backs are all of 2 years old, but they already have gone
through vast changeover from 1998. Only 10 players remain from the
inaugural D-Back team. This kind of changeover will only get worse
as free agency shatters whatever traditions there are left in
baseball. ...
</P>
<P>
   I think it's great that baseball has created an award in the
name of Hank Aaron. But once again, one has to ask why it took so
long. I mean, he's been the all-time home run king for 25 years.
...
</P>
<P>
   Aaron's award made me speculate on when Ken Griffey Jr. might
break it (assuming Mark McGwire doesn't beat him to it). Over the
last six seasons, five of which he hit 40 or more for the season,
Griffey has averaged one home run every three games.
</P>
<P>
   On a projection of Griffey playing 150 games a season and
keeping his one-in-three pace, he would hit home run No.400 in May
2000, No.500 in May 2002 and No.600 early in 2004, when he will be
just 34.
</P>
<P>
   He would be the second hitter to ever top 700 very early in
2006, pass Ruth's 714 in the summer, and likely begin the 2007
season needing just a handful of home runs to break the record. He
would then likely hit No.800 in 2008.
</P>
<P>
   Stats guys like Bill James use a protracted mathematical device
to compensate for statistical decline according to age. But the
upshot of any projection is that Griffey is the man most likely to
break it. By then, he might also be the first owner-player to ever
hold an all-time record. ...
</P>
<P>
   The NFL draft arrives next weekend, and the emphasis will be on
quarterbacks. The record for most quarterbacks chosen in the first
round is six, set in 1983, the class that produced Dan Marino, John
Elway and Jim Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   If one slots teams according to need, the record would likely be
broken. Scouts say 21 teams are definitely in the market for a
quarterback, and more than half of those project a 1999 draftee
would start by 2001 at the latest.
</P>
<P>
   These teams would include Baltimore, Carolina (Steve Beuerlein),
Chicago (Erik Kramer), Cleveland, Kansas City (Elvis Grbac), New
Orleans, New York Giants (Kent Graham), Oakland (Rich Gannon),
Philadelphia, Pittsburgh (Kordell Stewart), St. Louis (Tony Banks),
Seattle (Jon Kitna) and Tampa Bay (Trent Dilfer).
</P>
<P>
   Several others, like Atlanta (Chris Chandler), Cincinnati (Neil
O'Donnell), Dallas (Troy Aikman), Miami (Dan Marino) and San
Francisco (Steve Young), have aging quarterbacks, making the
drafting of one something to at least consider.
</P>
<P>
   The teams not really shopping: Arizona (Jake Plummer), Buffalo
(Doug Flutie/Rob Johnson), Denver (Bubby Brister/Brian Griese),
Detroit (Charlie Batch), Green Bay (Brett Favre), Indianapolis
(Peyton Manning), Jacksonville (Mark Brunell), Minnesota (Randall
Cunningham), New England (Drew Bledsoe), San Diego (Jim
Harbaugh/Ryan Leaf), Tennessee (Steve McNair) and Washington (Brad
Johnson). ...
</P>
<P>
   Here's how the '99 crop shakes out with a week to go:
</P>
<P>
   Top five picks: Tim Couch (Kentucky) and Akili Smith (Oregon).
Smith is Combine man-of-the-year because he had all of the
attributes NFL teams love. But he has only one year of Division I
football behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Top half, first round: Donovan McNabb (Syracuse) is this year's
upgrade of Steve McNair or Kordell Stewart. McNabb isn't as
talented as McNair, but he's very experienced running a pro
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Middle, first round: Cade McNown's (UCLA) stock depends on who
you ask. Those scouts who believe all quarterbacks must be 6-4 and
have a deep arm don't like him. Those who see him as a natural born
winner pray he'll be available when it's their turn. Said San
Francisco personnel man and ex-Bruin coach Terry Donahue: ``I would
love to have him, but he'll be long gone by the time we pick
(27th).'' Those NFL teams that passed on McNair will seriously
consider Daunte Culpepper (Central Florida). He's 6-4 and has a
howitzer for an arm.
</P>
<P>
   Low first round/second: Tulane's Shaun King is just 6-0, but he
earned a lot of admiration at workouts. Ted White (Howard) has been
compared by some to Doug Williams. Ohio State's Joe Germaine was
considered better than Brian Griese, the heir to John Elway's job.
</P>
<P>
   Others: Kansas State's Michael Bishop went into freefall after
K-State's national title chase died. Scouts feel he's too raw.
Washington's Brock Huard tumbled because of a soft reputation, but
Husky bloodlines will get him drafted. New Mexico's Graham Leigh is
the other sleeper besides White. ...
</P>
<P>
   News item: Divorce papers are filed by Andre Agassi and Brooke
Shields. Reaction: Coming to a cineplex near you, ``The Ex-Husbands
Club,'' starring Agassi, Dennis Rodman and Evander Holyfield, with
a cameo appearance by Tom Arnold.

CHILDS AND KNICKS TAKE HAWKS' BEST SHOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Chris Childs spit a tooth into his hand and fixed a
menacing stare on Dikembe Mutombo, who trotted away innocently. It
was all Childs could do not to dart toward the Hawks' towering
collection of pointy elbows and bony kneecaps and start swinging
away without regard to Mutombo's yard-long reach advantage.
</P>
<P>
   He'll save the retaliation for another game. It was too
important for him to keep his cool and stay in a game that had a
desperate, do-or-die feel to it. And Childs was too pivotal to the
outcome to let a flying elbow with four minutes left disturb the
uncommon poise the Knicks displayed Friday night as they broke
their three-game losing streak with an 86-78 victory at the Georgia
Dome.
</P>
<P>
   It was an uncommon night. Too often the Knicks (19-17) have
failed on the road and unraveled with a lead in the fourth quarter.
This time, they leaned on Childs for smooth ball movement, some
timely rebounds and the kind of in-your-face defense that put out
the fire on Mookie Blaylock's 28-point night.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Childs lifted the spirits of his beleaguered
team, which inched its way back into a playoff spot by a half game
after Toronto lost to the Nets, 106-99. All because he stayed in
the game and refused to counter a blow that left his front left
tooth in a box in his locker afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to get him back,'' said Childs, who was elbowed in
the mouth by Mutombo after he delivered a pass to Patrick Ewing,
who knocked down a jumper to give the Knicks an 80-71 lead with 3
minutes 59 seconds left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a 12-round fight. You can call Don King. It
was an intentional elbow. I'd already passed the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Mutombo just shrugged the broad shoulders on his 7-foot-2-inch
frame and waved off Childs' invitation the next time they meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what he says,'' said Mutombo, who finished with
21 rebounds but only scored 6 points. ``I don't get into those
stupid things. He can say what he wants. I didn't do anything to
him. I don't know what he's talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Childs was talking through a swollen lip. Although he was not
the team's primary scorer _ a right reserved for Latrell Sprewell's
18-point game on 6-for-15 shooting _ Childs delivered the kind of
energy the Knicks had been missing.
</P>
<P>
   With the Knicks holding a 67-65 lead to open the fourth quarter,
Childs penetrated and tossed a behind-the-back pass to Larry
Johnson. Johnson swung the ball to Sprewell, who passed it to
Childs on the right wing. Childs then drove the baseline and
sneaked in a no-look pass to Marcus Camby, who popped up for a
dunk.
</P>
<P>
   In one play, the Knicks revealed a side they have seldom shown
this year: they were aggressive, decisive, patient and unselfish.
</P>
<P>
   And they showed confidence. Two minutes later, Childs pulled up
for a 17-foot jumper with eight minutes to go. It did not matter
that he had been 1 for 4 on the night; he was not going to miss it.
Childs topped that with a couple of rebounds down the stretch, one
right in front of Mutombo, to keep his team moving forward. Instead
of giving up their lead, the Knicks increased it to 10 points by
holding the Hawks to 22 percent shooting from the field and forcing
them into five turnovers in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our mentality was better,'' Coach Jeff Van Gundy said.
``Must win? Yep, since we won, we had to have it. I thought we
played well on both ends. We can't exhale and think everything has
been corrected because it hasn't been.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks beat a good team on the road. The Hawks were missing
Steve Smith, but that did not take away from the way they closed
out the game. Without Smith, Blaylock was the threat. After
Blaylock had lit up Charlie Ward for five 3-pointers, Childs forced
him to miss his last three shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris had a great game,'' Ewing said. ``I know Dikembe elbowed
me in the head, too. We're friends but when we get on the floor,
it's war.''
</P>
<P>
   A war may be in the works. Mutombo, who has already broken two
noses this year with his lethal elbows, could face the wrath of
Childs. Not that he's worried. Mutombo rolled his eyes at Childs'
bravado.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's not a playoff game because I'm going to get him
back,'' Childs said. ``But I held back tonight. It wasn't worth it.
We needed this game. Getting into it tonight wasn't going to bring
my tooth back. If it had been a blowout, I might have done
something.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see how he hits me when I'm standing toe to toe.''
</P>
<P>
   REBOUNDS
</P>
<P>
   MARCUS CAMBY returned after missing three games with a strained
groin. He seemed to find his groove pretty quickly. Camby finished
4 for 6 shooting and scored 9 points, grabbed 5 rebounds and had a
blocked shot in 19 minutes. ... ALLAN HOUSTON missed five of his
first six shots but finished 4 for 9 for the game and scored 10
points. ... The Knicks improved their road record to 5-12. ...
Before their victory against Atlanta, the Knicks had been 1-7
against the top four teams in the Eastern Conference (Orlando,
Indiana, Miami and Atlanta).

KARROS DOUBLES FUN FOR DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They have won a pitcher's duel, won another game
with their bullpen picking up a starter. They have come from behind
late and rallied in the middle innings.
</P>
<P>
   Through the first week of the season the Los Angeles Dodgers
have won in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no way to explain the Dodgers' 9-6 win against the
Colorado Rockies on Friday at a cold Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros and Devon White tied career-highs with four hits
apiece. Karros also tied a Dodgers record with three doubles, the
third of which scored Todd Hundley to give the Dodgers a 6-4 lead
in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be a big inning for the Dodgers. Karros stole
third, and after Mike DeJean relieved Chuck McElroy and walked
Adrian Beltre, Jacob Brumfield's infield single plated Karros to
make it 7-4. Pinch-hitter Dave Hansen continued his hot start with
a single to right to score Beltre with the Dodgers' eighth run and
Raul Mondesi added a sacrifice fly in the eighth for a 9-5 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get caught up in a good game, a good two games, a
good three games,'' Karros said. ``I don't think anyone has gotten
caught up in anything. We haven't won anything yet.''
</P>
<P>
   If not for Dodgers closer Jeff Shaw snaring a Vinny Castilla
liner and turning it into a double play in the ninth, the Dodgers
might not have won this one. Instead, they followed up their only
loss of the season with their fourth win and evened the four-game
series at a win apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it took five Dodgers pitchers and 3 hours, 24 minutes
to get there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of seemed like the never-ending game,'' Karros said.
``It seemed like we were in good shape when we took a 5-1 lead and
they came back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers pounded out 17 hits, including six doubles, and took
a 9-5 lead into the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson was hoping for a ho-hum finish,
but the Rockies knocked Alan Mills from the game with a Neifi Perez
single and a Mike Kelly RBI double. Dante Bichette's infield single
put the tying run at the plate with none out, which is when
Castilla lined a slider back to Shaw.

<P>
   ``He hit if off the end of the bat so I had time, and it wasn't
too far from me,'' Shaw said. ``My first instinct was to look to
first, and (Castilla) was off the base.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw then struck out Thursday's home run hero Todd Helton to
record his second save.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was survival instinct,'' Johnson said. ``I was trying to
slide and not go to my closer in a non-close situation. I'm not one
to create a save situation.''
</P>
<P>
   No, but four other Dodgers pitchers could.
</P>
<P>
   It began with Darren Dreifort (1-0). He won in his season debut,
though it was laborsome at times. He allowed three hits and three
runs (two earned) and struck out seven, but he wasn't very
pitch-efficient. He threw 98 pitches (54 strikes) in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   The reliable Dodgers bullpen didn't fare that much better.
Johnson also went to Dave Mlicki, Pedro Borbon and Alan Mills, but
each allowed a run in a combined three innings.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Dodgers, the offense played its best game to
date. Karros and Devon White each had four hits, pacing a 17-hit
attack that built leads of 5-1 and 9-5.
</P>
<P>
   After getting four hits in the series opener, the Dodgers
knocked Rockies starter John Thomson (0-1) out of the fourth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about the way our offense is going,'' Johnson
said. ``We were able to do that without (Gary) Sheffield.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield missed the game because of a sore right hip. He's
hoping to play today, but the new mini-concern for Johnson is
second baseman Eric Young's left heel. Young hurt the heel in the
fifth fourth inning when he was rounding third before being held.
</P>
<P>
   Young scored on a base hit by Devon White to give the Dodgers
the 5-1 lead, and remained in the game. But afterward Johnson
expressed concern about Young's status for today.
</P>
<P>
   Team physical therapist Pat Screnar said Young had no swelling
in his heel, but the Dodgers' leadoff hitter would be evaluated
today.

RODMAN WON'T ANSWER CALL FOR LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Remember the Los Angeles Lakers' well-worn
slogan for the 1999 season? Say it together now: ``Dennis is
Dennis.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the mantra the Lakers live by, and might eventually die by.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Rodman, his own rulebook in hand, turned a slim Lakers
victory into another night of personal whimsy Friday. As the Lakers
tried mightily to close out a too-difficult 96-89 victory over the
Minnesota Timberwolves, Rodman refused to re-enter the game. For
the second time in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in the fourth quarter, the Lakers locked in a close
struggle with the Wolves, Rodman was summoned. He once again
pleaded ``tightness'' in his muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an unused stationary bicycle that Rodman himself
requested sat unused a few yards away from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Kurt Rambis tried to hide his frustration, but he made it
clear two weeks ago, when Rodman refused to re-enter a loss to
Sacramento, that it's the player's responsibility to be ready to
perform.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I wanted to put Dennis in, he said he was too stiff to go
in. So that was that,'' Rambis said Friday. ``I understand
ballplayers being stiff, but that's your job, to be ready the
entire basketball game. It doesn't matter whether you've played two
seconds or 48 minutes. It's the player's job to be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman's teammates downplayed the incident or declined to
discuss it.
</P>
<P>
   Last time this happened, Rodman skipped practice the next day.
Whether this is the precursor to another flare-up _ one that could
jeopardize Rodman's job _ is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   As per usual, Rodman did not speak to reporters afterward. He
did not address the issue in comments that were gathered by the
Lakers' public relations department.
</P>
<P>
   He did call the Lakers' effort ``nothing to be proud of'' and
``ridiculous. It's very disappointing for the fans to come out here
and see this kind of (garbage). It is not right. We should blow
teams like this away.''
</P>
<P>
   On that issue, he and the team are in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the Wolves overcame a 10-point, third-quarter deficit
and retook the lead briefly in the fourth despite playing without
three starters _ Joe Smith (attending father's funeral) and the
injured backcourt of Terrell Brandon and Anthony Peeler.
</P>
<P>
   And their only healthy star, Kevin Garnett, had an off-night,
missing 16 of 21 shots. But little-known Tom Hammonds scored 22
points _ 12 in the fourth quarter _ to lead a surprising charge,
and Minnesota tied the game as late as the 2:32 mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just need to understand where we are in the game a little
bit better,'' said Derek Harper. ``We have to find a way to finish
games off.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal staved off the upset, scoring four straight
points, then feeding Robert Horry for a layup to regain a
four-point lead with 1:16 to go. Former Clipper James Robinson's
3-point airball with about a minute left ended the threat, as the
Wolves were forced to foul.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal and Glen Rice scored 25 points each, and O'Neal added 15
rebounds _ 10 in the first half. Horry provided the latest spark
off the bench, hitting 5 of 5 shots and finishing with 13 points
and seven rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, despite the ugly win, the Lakers wake up today a
resurgent force in the Western Conference. With two straight wins,
the Lakers reclaimed fourth place in the conference for the first
time since March 25, moving just .001 ahead of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   But pleased with the way they got there? Not exactly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would I say I was happy? No, I wouldn't say that,'' Rambis
said. ``No. I'm not happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Not with the game, and presumably, not with his starting power
forward.

   Hoping for an Instant Replay &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On opening day of the baseball season in St. Louis, the luster,
the drama and anticipation _ the pure pleasure _ of much of last
season appeared to have hardly skipped a beat. As soon as Mark
McGwire came up to bat in the Cardinals' half of the first inning,
the sellout crowd of nearly 50,000 stood and cheered. And they kept
standing in prolonged homage as the millennium's Sultan of Swat _
the huge, rippling-muscled man who last season hit 70 homers,
breaking Roger Maris' hallowed, single-season home-run record by an
amazing nine _ walked. He struck out in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   But in the fifth McGwire, naturally, homered.
</P>
<P>
   Could this have been a harbinger of another resounding baseball
season, a season like the one that clearly marked a return for many
to the so-called national pastime, something that had been in
rather bad odor since the strike of 1994?
</P>
<P>
   Would McGwire and his virtual doppelganger, Sammy Sosa, make
another run at the record? Would the sullen Albert Belle, who also
homered in his first game for the Orioles? Could the Yankees
possibly repeat their magnificent performance? Might a Tony Gwynn
streak to a batting average of .400 for the year? Might there be
exciting division races, something lacking last season?
</P>
<P>
   However it turns out, it seemed that on opening day a nation was
returning with gusto to the days when it wanted to be taken out to
the ball game, to have some peanuts and Cracker Jack, and not to
care if it ever got back.

   For a time, it looked as if the son would go the way of the
father, toughing it out in great style. But John A. Gotti had
learned another lesson from watching his father: If the government
wants to put away a mobster, it can be pit-bull relentless. It
tried John J. Gotti four times before convicting him of murder in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   So on the eve of his trial, the younger Gotti cut a deal that
would give him what his lawyers, using parlance not customarily
heard in the underworld, described as ``closure.'' With striking
humility, Gotti pleaded guilty in White Plains, N.Y., to running a
criminal racket. The charges could send him to prison for seven
years, but Gotti received assurances that the plea would end all
other investigations.
</P>
<P>
   What prompted Gotti to fold his cards was learning that the
names of his jurors would be kept secret _ heightening the jurors'
sense that they had something to fear from Gotti _ and that even if
he won in White Plains he would soon be indicted in Brooklyn.

   An Inauspicious Start for a Chinese Premier's Visit  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Curse the stars, or whatever one blames for bad timing, but
Prime Minister Zhu Rongji of China walked into a minefield when he
visited Washington on the second stop on his nine-day, six-city
tour of America. The 70-year-old Chinese leader, known for his
hands-on management of his nation's economy and for his blunt
speaking style, impressed people in the capital with his candor.
But he blamed U.S. politics for the failure to close a deal for
China to enter the World Trade Organization, an agreement both
Chinese and U.S. negotiators said was agonizingly close.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said China was ``not quite there yet'' on its
long-standing application to join the world regulatory body on
trade. But the real issue was the sour political environment,
including fresh concerns about human rights and Chinese pilferage
of U.S. military secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Two months earlier or later, the two sides might have been able
to close the deal and send Zhu home with a prize, one Chinese
official ruminated. As it is, they will now go back to the
negotiating table and try to sign an agreement by the end of the
year. And Zhu, demonstrating a Chinese version of a stiff upper
lip, continued his tour of the United States with a stop in Denver,
to be followed by Chicago, New York and Boston.

   Check Out Your Driver
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court handed a warning to automobile passengers: You
give up your privacy rights when you get into the car, and if the
driver gets into trouble with the law, so may you.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled that as long as police have probable cause to
search a car for illegal drugs or other contraband, they can search
all closed containers in the car, including, in this case, a
passenger's pocketbook.
</P>
<P>
   Police need not suspect the passenger of a crime, Justice
Antonin Scalia said for the 6-3 majority, explaining that
``passengers, no less than drivers, possess a reduced expectation
of privacy'' when they get into a car.

   Too Much Cash? Just Give It Away.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Flush with cash from the soaring stock market, the nation's
foundations gave away a record amount of money last year, according
to a recent study. Foundations made an estimated $19.5 billion in
grants in 1998 to not-for-profit organizations, according to the
Foundation Center, a New York group that tracks foundation giving.
The amount represents an increase of about 41 percent since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The bull market has made donors more generous and fattened
endowments, according to the Foundation Center, which based its
1998 estimates on survey responses from more than 1,000
organizations.

   Accusations of Overcharging at Nuclear Cleanup Sites
</P>
<P>
   Cleaning up radioactive pollution at former nuclear weapons
plants has been tedious for workers and expensive for taxpayers,
although generally profitable for the contractors. Now an
accountant for two contractors at the Hanford nuclear reservation
in Washington state has filed a suit that says the contractors have
been illegally marking up their bills, adding overhead charges to
expenses that do not qualify.
</P>
<P>
   The contractors acted like a restaurant that pockets the
waitress' tips, according to the accountant, David Carbaugh, who
also claims he was fired for trying to alert the Energy Department.
The contractors, Fluor Daniel Hanford and Westinghouse Hanford Co.,
deny the charges, which were filed in U.S. District Court in
Spokane.

   A Guilty Plea in the Kidnapping and Murder of a Gay Man
</P>
<P>
   In Laramie, Wyo., where the murder of Matthew Shepard six months
ago provoked national soul-searching over violence against gay
people, Russell Henderson pleaded guilty to kidnapping and
murdering Shepard, a college student. He was sentenced to serve two
consecutive life terms in prison.
</P>
<P>
   To escape the death penalty, Henderson may have bargained with
prosecutors to testify in August in the capital murder trial of his
former friend, Aaron McKinney. In court, Henderson said McKinney
was the mastermind of the crime, choosing the student as a victim,
and then beating him savagely.
</P>
<P>
   Wyoming authorities have declined to classify the murder as a
hate crime or a murder motivated by hatred of gays.
</P>
<P>
   McKinney is expected to try to use the ``gay panic'' defense,
arguing that his uncontrollable anger was ignited by a sexual
advance by Shepard.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a Denver television reporter, obtained letters
written from jail by McKinney. In one letter peppered with
isspellings, McKinney, a high-school dropout, wrote to a female
friend that Shepard ``said he was gay and wanted a piece of me.''
In response, he wrote, ``Being verry drunk and homofobick I flipped
out and began to pistol whip'' the student.

   Drastic Action to Seal Leaks of Nuclear Secrets
</P>
<P>
   The current furor over the Clinton administration's handling of
evidence of Chinese atomic espionage is now forcing the
administration to scramble to plug leaks at America's three major
nuclear weapons laboratories, where it has been accused of
responding sluggishly to security problems.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most dramatic actions taken since the spy scandal
erupted last month, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson ordered a
suspension of all scientific work on the computer networks
containing America's most sensitive nuclear weapons secrets at the
Los Alamos, Sandia and Lawrence-Livermore laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   He took the action because he was convinced that security
problems had left the computer networks vulnerable to espionage.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Richardson decided to close down the networks for an
indefinite period after receiving an internal review that found
that security measures at Los Alamos and Lawrence-Livermore were
still below standard.
</P>
<P>
   Closing down the classified computer networks affects thousands
of workers at the weapons labs, and effectively halts most
classified work related to the maintenance of the U.S. nuclear
weapons inventory.

   Accusations of Overcharging at Nuclear Cleanup Sites
</P>
<P>
   Cleaning up radioactive pollution at former nuclear weapons
plants has been tedious for workers and expensive for taxpayers,
although generally profitable for the contractors. Now an
accountant for two contractors at the Hanford nuclear reservation
in Washington state has filed a suit that says the contractors have
been illegally marking up their bills, adding overhead charges to
expenses that do not qualify.
</P>
<P>
   The contractors acted like a restaurant that pockets the
waitress' tips, according to the accountant, David Carbaugh, who
also claims he was fired for trying to alert the Energy Department.
The contractors, Fluor Daniel Hanford and Westinghouse Hanford Co.,
deny the charges, which were filed in U.S. District Court in
Spokane.

   A Guilty Plea in the Kidnapping and Murder of a Gay Man
</P>
<P>
   In Laramie, Wyo., where the murder of Matthew Shepard six months
ago provoked national soul-searching over violence against gay
people, Russell Henderson pleaded guilty to kidnapping and
murdering Shepard, a college student. He was sentenced to serve two
consecutive life terms in prison.
</P>
<P>
   To escape the death penalty, Henderson may have bargained with
prosecutors to testify in August in the capital murder trial of his
former friend, Aaron McKinney. In court, Henderson said McKinney
was the mastermind of the crime, choosing the student as a victim,
and then beating him savagely.
</P>
<P>
   Wyoming authorities have declined to classify the murder as a
hate crime or a murder motivated by hatred of gays.
</P>
<P>
   McKinney is expected to try to use the ``gay panic'' defense,
arguing that his uncontrollable anger was ignited by a sexual
advance by Shepard.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a Denver television reporter, obtained letters
written from jail by McKinney. In one letter peppered with
misspellings, McKinney, a high-school dropout, wrote to a female
friend that Shepard ``said he was gay and wanted a piece of me.''
In response, he wrote, ``Being verry drunk and homofobick I flipped
out and began to pistol whip'' the student.

   Drastic Action to Seal Leaks of Nuclear Secrets
</P>
<P>
   The current furor over the Clinton administration's handling of
evidence of Chinese atomic espionage is now forcing the
administration to scramble to plug leaks at America's three major
nuclear weapons laboratories, where it has been accused of
responding sluggishly to security problems.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most dramatic actions taken since the spy scandal
erupted last month, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson ordered a
suspension of all scientific work on the computer networks
containing America's most sensitive nuclear weapons secrets at the
Los Alamos, Sandia and Lawrence-Livermore laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   He took the action because he was convinced that security
problems had left the computer networks vulnerable to espionage.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Richardson decided to close down the networks for an
indefinite period after receiving an internal review that found
that security measures at Los Alamos and Lawrence-Livermore were
still below standard.
</P>
<P>
   Closing down the classified computer networks affects thousands
of workers at the weapons labs, and effectively halts most
classified work related to the maintenance of the U.S. nuclear
weapons inventory.

   Gazing through a computer screen onto the vast expanse of the
World Wide Web, one feels like an explorer perched at the edge of
an endless wilderness. It's a bit of a letdown, then, to learn how
very finite the whole place really is.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at a company called Alexa Internet, using computers
to automatically plumb the depths of this ocean of information,
recently estimated that, as of last summer, the Web was three
terabytes in size _ three trillion bytes of information, about
5,000 CD-ROMs. Just about the whole thing would fit onto Sun
Microsystem's top-of-the-line StorEdge A7000 Intelligent Storage
Server, an array of speedy hard-disk drives occupying less than 150
cubic feet. This cyberspace that people have been romping around in
could be squeezed inside a bedroom closet.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not the size of the Web that matters. As the world is
increasingly coming to appreciate, physical space and cyberspace
operate according to different rules.
</P>
<P>
   In what they describe as a new science of Webology, computer
scientists at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center in Silicon Valley
recently funneled a large portion of the Web, about 55 million
pages (leaving out the pictures), onto 400 billion bytes of disk
space. Held in captivity in Palo Alto, this Web in a Box is poked
and prodded, studied like a great beast _ or, to use the metaphor
the researchers prefer, like an ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of this simulation, and by probing the real,
living Web with electronic signals, they seek laws by which the
members of the planetary community of Internet foragers compete and
cooperate in the constant search for information. The Internet has
become a living laboratory, a place to study mass human behavior
with a precision and on a scale never possible before.
</P>
<P>
   ``No central authority has cultivated the Web as a beautiful
garden,'' said Dr. Bernardo Huberman, an Internet ecologist at
Xerox PARC. ``It grows on its own like an ecosystem.'' Informavores
hunting down an interesting site link it to their own, and that
site is soon linked to others, forming a vast spider web of
connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sheer reach and structural complexity of the Web makes it
an ecology of knowledge, with relationships, information `food
chains,' and dynamic interactions that could soon become as rich
as, if not richer than, many natural ecosystems,'' Huberman wrote
in a paper last year with his colleagues Peter Pirolli, James
Pitkow and Rajan Lukose.
</P>
<P>
   But it is hard to find the right metaphor for something so
strange. Viewed in real time, with data seekers buzzing from site
to site, the Web can seem like a swarm of virtual insects, one
whose flutterings (in the form of mouse clicks) can be recorded and
sifted for clues to behavioral laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not doing computer science,'' Huberman said, ``but
something more akin to social science.'' What strategies do people
use to hunt down information? Why, for no apparent reason, do
storms of activity suddenly surge through the Internet, causing the
whole thing to grind to a halt? And why, just as mysteriously, do
these information fronts suddenly subside?
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Web began to burgeon, barely under human control,
people have been straining to relate it to something familiar _ an
ecosystem, the weather, an unruly crowd at a rock concert. The Web
is a great ocean on which you surf from site to site. It's a
cyberspace with a topology of its own: Two points distant in
physical space can be adjacent in cyberspace, a single mouse click
away. But an e-mail message sent in an instant to a neighbor next
door might be routed through a maze of links extending thousands of
miles.
</P>
<P>
   Lada Adamic, a Stanford University graduate student working on
Xerox PARC's Internet ecology project, recently found that
cyberspace, like the world described in the John Guare play ``Six
Degrees of Separation,'' is a small place indeed. Just as any two
people on Earth are said to be connected by a human chain of
acquaintance with no more than a few links, so can you pick two Web
sites at random and get from one to the other with about four
clicks.
</P>
<P>
   The research quantifies what Web users intuitively know: Because
of the high density of connections, it can be surprisingly easy to
find information in what amounts to a library without a card
catalog, filled with unindexed books.
</P>
<P>
   The thunderstorms of congestion on the Net, another study found,
can be analyzed in terms of crowd behavior. (Meteorology, sociology
_ the metaphors inevitably clash.) Sudden clots of congestion can
sometimes be traced to obvious causes, like the recent virtual
lingerie show of Victoria's Secret. More often they arise and
quickly dissipate for obscure reasons best understood using what
social scientists call game theory.
</P>
<P>
   You log on to the Internet and find the playing field uncrowded.
With Web sites popping up as quickly as you touch their links, you
click more and more, downloading video files and sound tracks with
little regard for the capacity, or ``bandwidth,'' you are
consuming. Millions of other players are selfishly doing the same.
Inevitably the activity reaches a threshold and connection speeds
start to crawl.
</P>
<P>
   Should you stay around, knowing that others will soon give up in
frustration, leaving you more room? Or will you gain in the long
run if you help relieve the congestion, logging off until the storm
has probably blown by? You must decide, in terms of game theory,
whether to defect from the common good or cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a classic social dilemma, a vastly larger-scale
version of what happens when you are confronted with a steady busy
signal at the theater box office and must decide whether to call
back later or set your phone on constant redial. Short spikes of
congestion are followed by lulls _ a pattern that can be predicted
statistically and verified by ``pinging'' the Net, as the engineers
say, bouncing thousands of packets of information off a particular
site and timing in milliseconds how long they take to return.
</P>
<P>
   From measuring millions of mouse clicks, another study has
derived a mathematical ``law of surfing'' predicting how many pages
one typically visits within a single Web site _ about 1{, a finding
that has been of keen interest to Internet entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   As the Web continues to grow exponentially (with everyone
someday as likely to have a Web page as a street address), it will
become an ever richer distillation of human behavior. Even the
dead, discontinued pages will be around for scholars to scrutinize.
</P>
<P>
   A group called the Internet Archive in San Francisco has
collected and stored on disks and tapes more than a billion Web
pages, exceeding 13 terabytes. (The entire Library of Congress has
been estimated to contain 20 terabytes of text.) The plan is to
provide snapshots, year by year, of just what the great terrestrial
brain has been thinking.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In view of the accumulating evidence of a genocidal campaign
unleashed against Kosovo's Albanians by Serbian forces directed by
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, the conduct of ordinary
Serbs is starting to attract the kinds of questions raised in
Daniel Jonah Goldhagen's book, ``Hitler's Willing Executioners,
Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversial book examined how some longstanding
``eliminationist'' myths within German culture predisposed what
might be thought of as normal citizens to accept, support and in
many instances actively carry out Nazi policies of Jewish
extermination. Those policies remain a benchmark of evil in this
century, and there are, of course, great differences of scale
distinguishing what happened in Germany from what is happening in
Serbia. Nonetheless, focusing on actions of common men and women in
both places and the willingness of many to follow murderous leads,
does not, at the moment, seem inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Goldhagen himself thinks that questioning the behavior of the
Serbian nation is essential. ``Right now is the time when we must
ask the question of how ordinary people have acted while it can
still influence events. Those who support what has been happening
in Kosovo should be made aware that they will be held complicit in
what will most likely be the last enormous crime of the century,''
said Goldhagen, a professor of government at Harvard who is working
on a study of genocide in the last 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Former Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, who is also a
former U.S. ambassador to Yugoslavia, raised a similar point last
week in an op-ed article in The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
   ``Although Milosevic is the prime mover behind the murder and
agony that have filled our television screens for the better part
of a decade, he has not acted alone. He may plan the strategy, but
the Serbian people are the willing instruments of his terror. There
are, of course, many decent Serbs who decry the violence, just as
there were decent Germans under Hitler, but that does not excuse
the Serb nation for its part in making a killing field of so much
of the former Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually, and probably rightly, issues of collective
responsibility remain taboo in polite society. Within the
pluralistic tradition, there is a reluctance to assign guilt to
all, or most, or even many citizens of an offending state, and
instead focus blame on culpable leaders. But as Goldhagen has
persuasively argued, there was a correlation between Hitler's
policies of extermination and the willingness of a sizable German
population to support such ideas. In an escalating manner the
actions of the Nazi leader and the approval of those he led
mutually reinforced and encouraged each other.
</P>
<P>
   And while, as Eagleburger noted, there are Serbs who have
deplored the violence, a similar reverberating process has been
under way in Serbia since 1987, when Milosevic broke Titoism's
major precept of never discussing ethnic tensions in public.
Instead, he openly played to Serb nationalist sentiments, affirming
widespread Serb feelings of victimization and martyrdom stretching
back centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of the collusive relationship between Milosevic and
the populace that both empowers and follows him has been evident in
the tone of such Serbian public expression as has reached beyond
Yugoslav territory. Some has been in the form of e-mail messages to
media organizations, universities, and addresses pulled out of the
air, like messages placed in bottles and thrown into the ocean.
There have also been the images of people at rock-concert rallies
in Belgrade and other cities, dancing in defiance of NATO and in
support of the man they call Slobo. According to sources in
Belgrade, the first of these rallies, which included some placards
critical of the leader, was spontaneous, but later ones were
organized and criticism disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   What is so striking about these expressions is how stridently
they clash with images of other people that the world has been
watching, images of people burned out of their homes, standing in
lines that have stretched for 15 miles trying to enter countries
that have no room for them or do not want them. Or images of people
from many different villages telling the same stories _ of their
friends and relatives shot and killed, of men being taken away to
places unknown. All of this is happening to Albanians at the hands
of Serbs less than 200 miles from Belgrade, but given the responses
of Serbs it might as well be taking place on the moon. Even in
1913, during a similar uprooting of Kosovars, there were louder
voices of dissent in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, neither Serbs nor any other people can be expected to
look much beyond their own fear and suffering when their cities are
being struck by rockets and bombs. It is unrealistic to assume that
any Serb might denounce the Serb assault on Albanians or that any
such cry inside the country would be loud enough to be heard above
the cheering and rallying around the chants of wartime chauvinism.
</P>
<P>
   Those few media organs in Serbia that have bravely struggled for
years to maintain independence in the face of government control
have been squelched. The radio station B-92 was shut down by police
last week but even before that it reported that it was not able to
report on what was happening in Kosovo. The journal Vreme has
suddenly suspended its previous criticism of the government.
</P>
<P>
   The images of the Albanian refugees that have been telecast all
over the world have not been carried by Serbian television and have
been seen only by those Serbians who have dish antennas and cable
service.
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible that people just don't know what is happening to
the Albanians and that therefore they bear little or no
responsibility for the support they show? Here too, Goldhagen saw
similarities with the Nazi period. ``How many Germans knew that
there was a formal program of Jewish extermination? My guess is not
many, but almost all knew that their civilization was killing Jews
by the tens of thousands.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that it would require a sizable force to burn villages
and set hundreds of thousands of residents to flight and that the
people carrying out such tasks all have relatives and friends who
would bring the accounts to general attention.

century, and there are, of course, great differences of scale
distinguishing what happened in Germany from what is happening in
Serbia. Nonetheless, focusing on actions of common men and women in
both places and the willingness of many to follow murderous leads,
does not, at the moment, seem inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Goldhagen himself thinks that questioning the behavior of the
Serbian nation is essential. ``Right now is the time when we must
ask the question of how ordinary people have acted while it can
still influence events. Those who support what has been happening
in Kosovo should be made aware that they will be held complicit in
what will most likely be the last enormous crime of the century,''
said Goldhagen, a professor of government at Harvard who is working
on a study of genocide in the last 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Former Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, who is also a
former U.S. ambassador to Yugoslavia, raised a similar point last
week in an op-ed article in The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
   ``Although Milosevic is the prime mover behind the murder and
agony that have filled our television screens for the better part
of a decade, he has not acted alone. He may plan the strategy, but
the Serbian people are the willing instruments of his terror. There
are, of course, many decent Serbs who decry the violence, just as
there were decent Germans under Hitler, but that does not excuse
the Serb nation for its part in making a killing field of so much
of the former Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually, and probably rightly, issues of collective
responsibility remain taboo in polite society. Within the
pluralistic tradition, there is a reluctance to assign guilt to
all, or most, or even many citizens of an offending state, and
instead focus blame on culpable leaders. But as Goldhagen has
persuasively argued, there was a correlation between Hitler's
policies of extermination and the willingness of a sizable German
population to support such ideas. In an escalating manner the
actions of the Nazi leader and the approval of those he led
mutually reinforced and encouraged each other.
</P>
<P>
   And while, as Eagleburger noted, there are Serbs who have
deplored the violence, a similar reverberating process has been
under way in Serbia since 1987, when Milosevic broke Titoism's
major precept of never discussing ethnic tensions in public.
Instead, he openly played to Serb nationalist sentiments, affirming
widespread Serb feelings of victimization and martyrdom stretching
back centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of the collusive relationship between Milosevic and
the populace that both empowers and follows him has been evident in
the tone of such Serbian public expression as has reached beyond
Yugoslav territory. Some has been in the form of e-mail messages to
media organizations, universities, and addresses pulled out of the
air, like messages placed in bottles and thrown into the ocean.
There have also been the images of people at rock-concert rallies
in Belgrade and other cities, dancing in defiance of NATO and in
support of the man they call Slobo. According to sources in
Belgrade, the first of these rallies, which included some placards
critical of the leader, was spontaneous, but later ones were
organized and criticism disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   What is so striking about these expressions is how stridently
they clash with images of other people that the world has been
watching, images of people burned out of their homes, standing in
lines that have stretched for 15 miles trying to enter countries
that have no room for them or do not want them. Or images of people
from many different villages telling the same stories _ of their
friends and relatives shot and killed, of men being taken away to
places unknown. All of this is happening to Albanians at the hands
of Serbs less than 200 miles from Belgrade, but given the responses
of Serbs it might as well be taking place on the moon. Even in
1913, during a similar uprooting of Kosovars, there were louder
voices of dissent in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, neither Serbs nor any other people can be expected to
look much beyond their own fear and suffering when their cities are
being struck by rockets and bombs. It is unrealistic to assume that
any Serb might denounce the Serb assault on Albanians or that any
such cry inside the country would be loud enough to be heard above
the cheering and rallying around the chants of wartime chauvinism.
</P>
<P>
   Those few media organs in Serbia that have bravely struggled for
years to maintain independence in the face of government control
have been squelched. The radio station B-92 was shut down by police
last week but even before that it reported that it was not able to
report on what was happening in Kosovo. The journal Vreme has
suddenly suspended its previous criticism of the government.
</P>
<P>
   The images of the Albanian refugees that have been telecast all
over the world have not been carried by Serbian television and have
been seen only by those Serbians who have dish antennas and cable
service.
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible that people just don't know what is happening to
the Albanians and that therefore they bear little or no
responsibility for the support they show? Here too, Goldhagen saw
similarities with the Nazi period. ``How many Germans knew that
there was a formal program of Jewish extermination? My guess is not
many, but almost all knew that their civilization was killing Jews
by the tens of thousands.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that it would require a sizable force to burn villages
and set hundreds of thousands of residents to flight and that the
people carrying out such tasks all have relatives and friends who
would bring the accounts to general attention.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail from Serbia is characterized by an overwhelming sense
of defensiveness and unredeemed victimization. As the
correspondents denounce NATO and the United States, there is no
sense that the rockets are a response to Serb conduct. The
Albanians, if they are mentioned at all, are referred to as Muslims
who wish to establish a base for guerrilla terror, or narcotics
traffickers, or former allies and beneficiaries of the Ottoman
Turks. As for Serbs, they are persistently portrayed as defenders
of Christianity in Europe, heroic fighters in two world wars whose
contributions to civilization have gone unrewarded. Even writers
who identify themselves as Milosevic's opponents show more scorn
than sympathy for the Kosovar Albanians, blaming them for keeping
him in power by boycotting elections rather than voting with the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the letters mention the sacredness of Kosovo to Serbs
and cite the battle there in 1389 at which they were defeated by
the Turks. There are far fewer references to the more contemporary
history of Serb conflicts with Croats and Bosnians over the last
eight years. For instance no one mentions the destruction of
Vukovar by Serbs in 1991 or the massacre of Bosnian men and boys in
Srebrenica in 1995, an atrocity for which the military and
political leaders of the Bosnian Serbs have been indicted. Such
things appear to be missing from the current context although there
are occasional accurate references to the Croats having waged
campaigns of ethnic cleansing that chased Serbs into flight.
</P>
<P>
   But where does patriotism end and complicity in war crimes
begin? Surely there is a difference between people who are chanting
``Slobo, Slobo'' and those who are burning homes, separating wives
and husbands, and shooting civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Aryeh Neier, the president of the Open Society Institute and the
author of ``War Crimes, Brutality, Genocide, Terror and the
Struggle for Justice,'' argues that in recent wars like those in
Rwanda and Bosnia, there was a greater degree of criminal
responsibility on the part of ordinary citizens than was the case
in Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
   With the Nazis, he pointed out, the killing was highly
bureaucratized, and the victims were generally unknown to those who
killed them. In Rwanda and Bosnia, he said, many of the
perpetrators knew the victims, often having lived with them, gone
to school with them and in some cases married into their families.
In both places, Neier said, because of the way people were killed,
there were almost as many killers as victims.
</P>
<P>
   As for Kosovo, he said there was insufficient information to
determine what was happening or how to apportion responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   In Tirana, the Albanian capital, there lives an Albanian writer
named Fatos Lubunja, who under the regime of the late dictator
Enver Hoxa spent 17 years in prison. Now he edits an intellectual
journal and monitors human rights abuses. In a message to a friend
he traced many instances of Serb attacks on Albanians, dating from
expulsion in 1878 when Milan Obrenovic, a Serbian king, rallied his
countrymen with the words, ``The more Albanians you kick out of our
land the greater patriots you will be.'' Lubunja cited ethnic
cleansing campaigns of 1913 and 1920, and then he addressed the
questions that Goldhagen raised in his book.
</P>
<P>
   He was, he said, suspicious of judgments based on assumptions
that people inevitably repeat the conduct of their ancestors. ``But
if we can speak of collective guilt, I think we have to consider a
long historical process of manipulation; all those politicians,
historians, writers, teachers, who have created and nourished some
dangerous myths, have manipulated history and, in the end, created
those closed-minded horrible human beings who are ready to kill the
others.''

<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria _ Two weeks into the Western bombardment of
Yugoslavia, with the air attacks aimed at punishing Christian Serbs
for their persecution of Muslim Kosovars, the Islamic world was
presented with a U.S. military campaign that it could identify
with. After all, the United States and its allies were clearly
siding with Muslims this time, not reflexively bashing Iraq or
unstintingly supporting Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But the reaction has been anything but simple. Sympathies for
the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo, most of whom are Muslims, are
strong in the Muslim Middle East, but they are tangled with another
powerful sentiment _ an abiding mistrust of the West, whose resort
to force against the Serbs is being seen as something much less
than heroic.
</P>
<P>
   Only Jordan and Egypt have even gone so far as to withdraw their
ambassadors from Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital. Not a single Arab
government has openly endorsed the Western airstrikes, and Iraq,
Libya and Iran have condemned them.
</P>
<P>
   In the Islamic world, of course, the Kosovars who have been
driven from their homes are much more than generic civilians. They
are fellow Muslims, and many in the Middle East believe they are
being made to suffer because of religion. In genuine solidarity,
Arab and Muslim countries have dispatched tents, food and other
supplies to the Balkans to assist the victims.
</P>
<P>
   But against the backdrop of recent history, the U.S.-led air
operations are being viewed by most Arabs and Muslims with an
uneasy ambivalence. One source of the discomfort is a gnawing
suspicion that the offensive may have accelerated the exodus. A
larger reason, more unique to the Middle East, is rooted deeply in
the way most Arabs and Muslims look at recent history. Until the
Kosovo crisis began, after all, the focus of U.S. military might
had been squarely on the Islamic world, with cruise-missile strikes
in Afghanistan, Sudan and Iraq in the last eight months alone.
</P>
<P>
   In each of those cases, Arab and Muslim leaders have voiced
protests, contending that at least the attacks should have been
preceded by U.N. authorization. And yet, once again in Kosovo, the
United States and its allies have bypassed the United Nations,
intensifying what in Arab eyes was already a worrying trend.
</P>
<P>
   It may be Serbs, not Muslims who are targets, but the current
offensive appears to many Arabs and other Muslims as more of the
same: a fresh case of Western heavy-handedness. The next time the
United States and its allies decide to unleash military might, they
warn, a Muslim country will likely again be the target. And that
next time, the West will have crossed another important threshold,
having carried out a sustained military operation without even
paying heed to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is any Muslim feeling safer?'' asked Iran's supreme leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, bitterly in a speech in Tehran last week,
in a reference to the attack on the Serbs. He said of the West,
``In the name of democracy, they feel entitled to use the strongest
measures against those who disagree with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the reaction has not been altogether uniform, and some
Arab intellectuals who have in the past been outspoken critics of
the West have begun to speak out against fellow Arabs for their
standoffishness.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamist author Fahmy Howeidy, writing in the Egyptian
newspaper Al Ahram, compared the horror unfolding in the Balkans
with the ``slaughter and mayhem unleashed by the Tartars seven
centuries ago in the sacking of Baghdad, an infamous turning point
in Islamic history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt that what the Serbs are doing in Kosovo is
even worse,'' Howeidy wrote, adding: ``Anyone who purports
neutrality is a traitor to the wretched Muslims of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   But most other Arab commentators, and Arab leaders themselves,
have shied away from casting the conflict as a religious war, an
idea that many warn is a dangerously volatile proposition. And
while the United States and its allies have vowed that the Kosovar
refugees will be returned to their homeland, the exodus of the
Kosovars has served to remind many Arabs of what they recall as a
past Western betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   In the Middle East, the flight of the Kosovars to Macedonia and
Albania looks much like the flight of Palestinians to Jordan, Syria
and Lebanon after the creation of Israel in 1948. That, too, was
described at the time as a temporary uprooting, but it has proven
effectively permanent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is history repeating itself?'' The Syria Times asked last
week, questioning whether the United States and its allies will
prove any more willing to fight for the return of the Kosovars than
they were for a return of the Palestinians who are still in refugee
camps around the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   The skepticism reflects a gap between Arab public opinion and
U.S. policy that has only widened in recent years, driven mostly by
Arab bitterness toward what is seen as Washington's one-sided
handling of Israel and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, Arab culture does tend to put a
premium on skepticism. And so in coffee houses and salons, all
kinds of theories are being floated, including the idea that the
West's true motive in bombing is not to help the Kosovars at all,
but to hurt them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't forget that this is the land of conspiracy,'' said Nabil
Samman, a Syrian political commentator. ``And many people think
that this is a conspiracy between NATO and the Serbs to drive the
Albanians out.''

<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ The leaders of NATO have long been planning
a summit meeting in Washington from April 23 to 25 to celebrate the
alliance's first 50 years and chart a new ``strategic concept''
defining its role in European security in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, that role is being defined in practice in
Kosovo, not on paper in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The role right now is that of a bulwark against the consequences
of ethnic instability in Europe's southeastern rim. For that, much
more than Russian nuclear bombs, is today the biggest threat to
European security, as it was a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   And if NATO cannot defeat the effort by President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia to drive the ethnic Albanian population out
of the historic Serbian province of Kosovo, the alliance risks
going the way of the League of Nations and other failed
20th-century attempts to deal with the same ethnic instability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to stop this tragedy of great dimensions, caused by
somebody who has a name, Slobodan Milosevic,'' said NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana. As a young man during the Cold
War, he opposed Spain's entry into the alliance. Now, still a
socialist who describes himself as a Social Democrat, he defines
the purpose of the allied bombing campaign in Kosovo as ``a mission
of human rights and trying to preserve human values.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether NATO's chosen strategy of using bombs instead of ground
troops to stop the brutal Serb ``ethnic cleansing'' in Kosovo can
succeed is highly debatable, at least outside the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Milosevic's unilateral ``cease-fire'' last week, and his
dickering over the freedom of three U.S. soldiers who were captured
on the Macedonian border, were signs of weakness rather than
tactical maneuvers for advantage, the allies have given themselves
a daunting task: to stop the Serb attacks against civilians, escort
nearly half a million refugees back to their homes in Kosovo, and
guarantee a lasting peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Many military experts believe it will take ground forces to do
the job, and this presents new complications for NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the risk of completely losing face, it will be necessary to
move to a combined air and ground operation,'' Gen. Maurice
Schmitt, a retired French chief of staff, wrote in the daily Le
Figaro last week. He suggested that it could be done with fewer
than 150,000 allied troops.
</P>
<P>
   But the use of ground troops, with its implications of
casualties, is the most sensitive political question for President
Clinton and other NATO leaders. Led by the United States, NATO
continues to insist that it will only go in after the Serb forces
withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   NATO was conceived 50 years ago to prevent World War III, not to
face down tinpot tyrants in the Balkans. In the age of nuclear
standoff, its credibility was unquestioned, and it won the Cold War
without ever firing a shot.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in taking military action in Europe, NATO has felt bold
enough to do what it could not think of doing in Hungary or
Czechoslovakia or Poland when the Soviet Union intervened. And
Milosevic, for his part, has done what Stalin and his successors
never dared to do, defying allied threats and then allied bombing.
Indeed, he used the bombing as cover for a long-prepared campaign
of military and police brutality against Kosovo Albanian civilians.
</P>
<P>
   So, under their current strategy for preserving their
credibility, the allies will have to show continued stamina and
united resolve to keep punishing the Serb military and police
forces until they give up, a task that could take weeks or even
months.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's foreign ministers will try to demonstrate determination
by gathering in Brussels on Monday, but for some members _
particularly Greece, which has Orthodox religious ties with Serbia,
and Italy, which fears being overwhelmed by Albanian refugees _ it
has not been easy.
</P>
<P>
   The sources of the current bind are not difficult to trace. Even
though credibility has always been NATO's most important asset,
NATO frittered away the credibility of its bombing threat against
Milosevic, menacing him with words so many times over the past year
of violence in Kosovo that in the end he concluded the alliance was
full of hot air.
</P>
<P>
   He was wrong. But NATO was also wrong if it thought Milosevic
would cave in after being hit by a few bombs. Milosevic gambled
that he could create an Albanian-free Kosovo faster than allied
conventional bombing could reduce the military and police forces he
was using to carry out his brutal sweeps. And with 10 days of bad
weather and NATO aircraft less effective than hoped against Serb
tanks and troops, he has come close to winning his gamble.
</P>
<P>
   The allies now hope the tide has begun to turn, but they will
have to do more than fight Milosevic to a draw to show that the
alliance has a credible role for the future.
</P>
<P>
   For the first 40 years of NATO's existence, Article 5 of the
North Atlantic Treaty, signed in Washington on April 4, 1949,
defined the core of the alliance as collective defense against
armed attack. But then the threat of armed attack from Russia
became secondary when communism collapsed; in its place, the
virulent nationalisms of the Balkans and the Caucasus that helped
spark World War I became wildly resurgent.
</P>
<P>
   This produced what the alliance calls ``non-Article 5''
missions, like the peacekeeping force in Bosnia and the air
operation over Kosovo. ``Preserving strategic stability in the
Euro-Atlantic area'' is probably the way the alliance will define
its reason for being in the new strategic concept to be approved in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo has reminded the European allies that when security
problems in their own back yard require a rapid military response,
they need U.S. help. But the United States, as the allies see it,
wavers between wanting to drag them into distant confrontations in
places like Iraq and North Korea, and losing interest in a Europe
that ought to be able to take care of itself.
</P>
<P>
   So they debate over things like how the European allies could
use NATO structures to conduct military operations without the
United States, or how the European Union could build a defense
structure of its own.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a lot of talking about such things in Washington
in two weeks. But none of it will mean much if the allies do not
get things right in Kosovo.

<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ The leaders of NATO have long been planning
a summit meeting in Washington from April 23 to 25 to celebrate the
alliance's first 50 years and chart a new ``strategic concept''
defining its role in European security in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, that role is being defined in practice in
Kosovo, not on paper in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The role right now is that of a bulwark against the consequences
of ethnic instability in Europe's southeastern rim. For that, much
more than Russian nuclear bombs, is today the biggest threat to
European security, as it was a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   And if NATO cannot defeat the effort by President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia to drive the ethnic Albanian population out
of the historic Serbian province of Kosovo, the alliance risks
going the way of the League of Nations and other failed
20th-century attempts to deal with the same ethnic instability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to stop this tragedy of great dimensions, caused by
somebody who has a name, Slobodan Milosevic,'' said NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana. As a young man during the Cold
War, he opposed Spain's entry into the alliance. Now, still a

   MEXICO CITY _ A Mexican governor suddenly runs afoul of the top
authorities. Instead of appearing in court to defend himself, he
goes on the lam. Later, he sends a message from a clandestine
location saying he is being persecuted by aides to the Mexican
president and fears for his life.
</P>
<P>
   Last week that was the news from Mexico _ the story of Mario
Villanueva Madrid, the governor who became a fugitive from drug and
racketeering charges.
</P>
<P>
   But broadly speaking, it's also an old story. It was the story
of Pablo Chapa Bezanilla, the deputy attorney general who went
underground in 1997; and of Gerardo de Prevoisin, the president of
Mexico's largest airline, who fled into hiding three years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The general outlines also fit the story of Mario Ruiz Massieu, a
former drug czar who fled Mexico in 1995, and of Carlos Cabal
Peniche, a bank president who lived clandestinely for four years
before his arrest in Australia in November.
</P>
<P>
   There are so many other such cases that to Mexicans, the public
figure turned fugitive has become something of cliche.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our system, there's a thin line separating public officials
from outlaws, and legality from illegality,'' said Homero Aridjis,
a Mexican poet and head of International PEN, the writers' group.
``Overnight, they can leave behind their prerogatives of power and
turn into fugitives.''
</P>
<P>
   To Americans, the idea of running from justice seems like a bad
one even for common criminals, much less for state governors,
federal prosecutors or top corporate executives. But in Mexico,
most recent cases demonstrate the opposite: Fleeing justice usually
pays off.
</P>
<P>
   With the justice system awash in graft and vulnerable to
political pressure, those who clash with the president and his men
but have enough money to flee usually defend themselves more
effectively from exile or even from underground than from a Mexican
prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like Mario Villanueva who become fugitives are experts
in our authoritarian system,'' said Lorenzo Meyer Cosio, a
historian at Mexico City's Colegio de Mexico. ``They know that if
you confront the president, there is no court or judge or defense
team that can protect you.''
</P>
<P>
   Villanueva, the governor of the Caribbean state of Quintana Roo
who clashed with President Ernesto Zedillo and his associates, fled
into hiding last month. Tuesday, the day after his six-year tenure
ended, an arrest warrant was issued for him. Villanueva faxed
newspapers to decry the ``lynch mob'' atmosphere in which
prosecutors were manufacturing evidence to ``destroy me physically,
psychologically and morally.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Mexicans view former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari,
who left Mexico during a 1995 dispute with Zedillo, as a kind of
fugitive. In exile in Ireland, he has not been charged with any
crime. His brother Raul, however, was convicted in January for the
murder of a rival politician, illustrating how badly trials can go
here for defendants who do not flee; Raul's conviction came despite
multiple contradictions in the government's case and proof of
evidence rigging.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Chapa, the deputy attorney general who in 1997 was
indicted for planting a skeleton to incriminate Raul Salinas in the
murder case, demonstrated the wisdom of going underground.
</P>
<P>
   With police closing in, Chapa fled his home in the trunk of his
car, and later sent a letter to newspapers calling himself a
``refugee in self-defense.'' Chapa was later arrested and jailed in
Spain and extradited. But by then he was well-prepared for legal
skirmishes, and once in Mexico was quickly freed.
</P>
<P>
   Another fugitive who beat the system is Angel Isidoro Rodriguez,
a banker who fled to Spain in 1994 after he was accused of fraud.
The Spanish authorities arrested and jailed him last year, but
after his extradition to Mexico, lawyers quickly obtained his
release, too.
</P>
<P>
   Several fugitives have floated the threat that they could reveal
details of high-level corruption or criminality, and many Mexicans
believe that has helped them in their battles with the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   De Prevoisin, the airline chief who fled into exile when he was
charged with embezzling $72 million in 1994, later accused
Zedillo's party of extorting $8 million from the airline during his
election campaign. De Prevoisin eluded arrest until last year and
is currently fighting extradition from Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Cabal Peniche, a banker and friend of former President
Salinas, fled Mexico in 1994 amid charges that he participated in a
$700 million fraud. Authorities traced him to Australia, where he,
too, is battling extradition. Cabal has also threatened to reveal
details of his donations to Zedillo's campaign, estimated at $4
million. ``I am being persecuted because of the threat that it is
believed I represent to the system,'' he said recently.

LIBYA'S GADHAFI WEARIES OF THE COLD SHOULDER

<P>
   Highly placed visitors invited lately to the palatial desert
tent of Col. Moammar Gadhafi sensed in the Libyan leader's
conversation a yearning to be readmitted to the world. Me, a
terrorist? he would plead. Of course, he was always an
unpredictable loner and he did spend decades bankrolling
revolutionaries and guerrilla leaders, especially in Africa. But
why are they _ now often heads of government just as he is _
getting all the invitations to London and Washington while he is
left stranded in the sand?
</P>
<P>
   Arabs, Africans, a procession of international lawyers and U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan have been telling Gadhafi for months
that only he can end his isolation, by turning over for trial two
Libyan intelligence agents accused of masterminding the bombing of
Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988, an attack
that killed 280 people. Last week, running out of hope for any
further concessions from Britain and the United States, Gadhafi
finally agreed to deliver the suspects to a former military base in
the Netherlands, where they will be tried under Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
   Was it Libya's oil-dependent economy, in a tailspin because of
world petroleum prices, that did it? Was it threats from Washington
that things could get worse for Tripoli if there was not a break in
the decadelong standoff? Was it that Gadhafi's options had run out
and that, like Saddam Hussein, he had failed to persuade his Arab
neighbors to defy international law and break sanctions on his
behalf? Or was his search for a new kind of Arab nationalism,
rooted in the 1950s and '60s, hopelessly out of date, rendering him
an irritant as well as an anomaly in the Arab world?
</P>
<P>
   No one explanation seems to suffice, say those who have dealt
with the Libyan leader.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the once-flamboyant Gadhafi _ who spent much of last
year in a wheelchair, on crutches or leaning on a cane after what
he brushed off as broken bones but what his critics suspect may
have been an ambush or attempted assassination _ had to battle his
own secret demons. A quixotic leader who 30 years ago transformed
an Arab monarchy into something he chose to call the Libyan Arab
Jamahiriya, or state of the masses, Gadhafi took a political risk
in turning over two citizens to foreign powers he had spent years
vilifying as enemies of his people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very important step,'' said Hussein Hassouna, the
Arab League's representative at the United Nations. ``It will
change everything in the region.'' Arabs say Gadhafi was aware he
had boxed himself in with his refusal to cooperate in the Lockerbie
case and was being bypassed by developments in the Arab world and
the Mediterranean, where links between North Africa and the
European Union are expanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody said to him, `Once you take that step, it will open
up a lot of potential; you have a lot to gain,''' Hassouna said.
Investors and tourists alike seem poised to pounce on the novelty
of Libya, a Mediterranean nation with historical sites as old as
Phoenicia.
</P>
<P>
   More important than advice, however, were the cover and strong
shoulders to lean on that Arab leaders, Annan and President Nelson
Mandela of South Africa gave Gadhafi. Mandela went to Libya more
than a year ago (to the annoyance of Washington) and honored
Gadhafi with South Africa's highest award for Libya's assistance to
the African National Congress during the long years of apartheid.
With trust established, Mandela was able to play a major role _
later to be joined by President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Crown
Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia _ in persuading Gadhafi to accept
the creative Arab proposal that the two Libyan agents be tried in a
third country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was easier to accede to the urging of Mandela than to be
seen to be surrendering to the United States,'' said Thomas Franck,
director of the Center for International Studies at the New York
University Law School. ``The main task in arranging an outcome like
this is to find a way that one of the most eccentric of leaders can
climb down the tree he's climbed up without appearing to be giving
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Clovis Maksoud, a former representative of the Arab League at
the United Nations and now director of the Center for the Global
South at American University in Washington, said: ``Mandela assumed
a fatherly approach. Mandela said, `He helped us in the past, and
we will help him now.'''
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to suggestions that Gadhafi stalled because he feared a
foreign court he could not control, Franck said the Libyan leader
has been one of the most frequent users of the International Court
of Justice in the Hague, Netherlands (unrelated to the specially
created Scottish panel that will try the Libyans), and has abided
by its rulings _ not a claim that can be made by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Libyans allowed the international court, better known as the
World Court, to adjudicate sea rights in a dispute with Tunisia and
Malta, and also obeyed the court's order to return to Chad a strip
of territory fought over in a long and costly war.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, international sanctions on Libya, though not separate
U.S. restrictions on travel and trade, were suspended as promised.
As a result, Libya is now free _ assuming the suspension becomes
permanent in 90 days _ to reopen airline links with the rest of the
world, upgrade its oil industry, rebuild a decrepit communications
system, construct a railroad and pursue other long-delayed
development projects with the help of foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   Yet people who have dealt with Gadhafi say it was not economic
considerations alone that made a settlement possible. The Libyan
leader is too complex for that.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions on Libya, imposed in 1992 and widened in 1993, bit
into the economy, but not too hard. Unlike Iraq, Libya was able to
continue selling oil and gas, its big money earners, and spend the
money on anything it chose except arms and certain equipment for
the petroleum industry.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was Washington's threat of wider sanctions crucial, since it
was assumed that the Clinton administration would find it hard to
persuade the Security Council to take such a step, given
Washington's growing alienation from the United Nations and a
general wariness there about the long-term wisdom of embargoes,
with their unfortunate side effects on civilians. Moreover, the
United States is deeply involved in Kosovo and monitoring a
critical Israeli election and an unfinished war in Iraq, among
other crises. So Libya has slipped down the scale of policy
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   A need to end his isolation and salvage his place in history may
have been the most important factor to Gadhafi.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has definitely got out of the cage he was in,'' Maksoud
said. ``But it is not a defeat for him or a triumph for the
Americans.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Highly placed visitors invited lately to the palatial desert
tent of Col. Moammar Gadhafi sensed in the Libyan leader's
conversation a yearning to be readmitted to the world. Me, a
terrorist? he would plead. Of course, he was always an
unpredictable loner and he did spend decades bankrolling
revolutionaries and guerrilla leaders, especially in Africa. But
why are they _ now often heads of government just as he is _
getting all the invitations to London and Washington while he is
left stranded in the sand?
</P>
<P>
   Arabs, Africans, a procession of international lawyers and U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan have been telling Gadhafi for months
that only he can end his isolation, by turning over for trial two
Libyan intelligence agents accused of masterminding the bombing of
Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988, an attack
that killed 280 people. Last week, running out of hope for any
further concessions from Britain and the United States, Gadhafi
finally agreed to deliver the suspects to a former military base in
the Netherlands, where they will be tried under Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
   Was it Libya's oil-dependent economy, in a tailspin because of
world petroleum prices, that did it? Was it threats from Washington
that things could get worse for Tripoli if there was not a break in
the decadelong standoff? Was it that Gadhafi's options had run out
and that, like Saddam Hussein, he had failed to persuade his Arab
neighbors to defy international law and break sanctions on his
behalf? Or was his search for a new kind of Arab nationalism,
rooted in the 1950s and '60s, hopelessly out of date, rendering him
an irritant as well as an anomaly in the Arab world?
</P>
<P>
   No one explanation seems to suffice, say those who have dealt
with the Libyan leader.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the once-flamboyant Gadhafi _ who spent much of last
year in a wheelchair, on crutches or leaning on a cane after what
he brushed off as broken bones but what his critics suspect may
have been an ambush or attempted assassination _ had to battle his
own secret demons. A quixotic leader who 30 years ago transformed
an Arab monarchy into something he chose to call the Libyan Arab
Jamahiriya, or state of the masses, Gadhafi took a political risk
in turning over two citizens to foreign powers he had spent years
vilifying as enemies of his people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very important step,'' said Hussein Hassouna, the
Arab League's representative at the United Nations. ``It will

<P>
   How is a man of middle age supposed to feel when he is told,
some three decades after his inglorious stateside military service,
that he played an essential part in the defeat of godless
communism?
</P>
<P>
   How is he supposed to feel upon learning that Congress has, at
long last, recognized his contribution to the national defense with
something called the Cold War Recognition Certificate?
</P>
<P>
   The certificate took its place in the pantheon of military
honors last week, when the Defense Department began accepting
applications. Anyone who served in the armed forces or in one of
several federal government positions between Japan's 1945 surrender
ending World War II and Mikhail Gorbachev's resignation as
president of the Soviet Union at the end of 1991 is eligible to
apply.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., the certificate could
go to as many as 22 million people. It carries no financial
benefits or privileges whatever. But, oh, the glory!
</P>
<P>
   Bearing Defense Secretary William Cohen's signature, the
certificate looks and sounds not unlike an honorable discharge. A
Pentagon spokesman, Army Lt. Col. Tom Begines, said the brass did
not push for the certificate, but allowed that maybe it's not such
a bad idea. Government civilians who fought the good fight but have
no military discharges to show for it (foreign service employees,
Defense Department workers, people in intelligence agencies) might
be pleased to have a certificate, the colonel suggested.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Lazio, Mollie Conkey, said her boss got
the idea a few years ago while talking to the husband of one of his
aides. The man had spent eight years in the Army and knew full well
that victory does not always come on the battlefield, that victory
and glory do not always march in step.
</P>
<P>
   And so language creating the Cold War certificate was tucked
into a military-spending bill for the 1998 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the greatest triumphs of freedom and democracy ended
without so much as a parade or any formal recognition,'' Lazio said
last fall, in remarks timed to coincide the start of CNN's ``Cold
War'' series. ``The time has come to remind the world that the
American victory in bringing the Cold War to an end _ while
avoiding nuclear devastation _ is one of the greatest achievements
in the history of mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   But how is a middle-aged man to feel if he knows, in his heart
of hearts, that he wasn't trying to do much for mankind, that he
was just trying to get his military service out of the way?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps his biggest hardships were, say, the broiling August sun
at Fort Knox, Ky., during basic training, then the winter damp at
Fort Gordon, Ga., where he learned to operate teletypes and code
machines, followed by five-and-a-half years of weekly reserve
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone desiring a certificate can write to Cold War Recognition,
4035 Ridge Top Rd., Fairfax, VA 22030. Information is available on
the Internet at coldwar.army.mil/
</P>
<P>
   Because so many people are eligible and not everyone may covet a
certificate, the Pentagon decided to send them only to people who
ask, Begines said. The operation has been budgeted at $600,000 for
the next fiscal year, with future spending uncertain, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans' groups have been enthusiastic about the certificate,
Begines said, perhaps because veterans _ those who were shot at and
those who weren't _ have memories not just of fear and death, but
of being bored and tired.
</P>
<P>
   And homesick. ``For most of the Cold War, the United States
maintained a force of over 300,000 service people in Europe,
patrolling the borders and skies of our allies,'' Begines said.
They fought a war that lasted four decades _ ``a long twilight
struggle,'' in the words of President John F. Kennedy, who knew
what war was like.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people saved us from a nuclear holocaust,'' said Ms.
Conkey, the congressional aide.
</P>
<P>
   But the middle-aged man in question never went overseas, never
got shot at. If he were given a special commendation, it might
right read like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Whereas he kept a stoic expression while enduring the
profanity of the master sergeant, and whereas he braved the grease
and sweat of countless hours of mess hall duty;
</P>
<P>
   ``And whereas during basic training he handled a rifle pretty
well and managed to throw a real, honest-to-goodness live hand
grenade without blowing up himself or his buddies, and whereas he
performed his clerical duties efficiently and conscientiously
thereafter ...''
</P>
<P>
   This middle-aged man doesn't think he did all that much, not
when he recalls standing amid acres of white crosses in the U.S.
military cemetery overlooking Omaha Beach, not when he remembers a
college classmate who didn't come back from Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Let others who are more deserving get their Cold War Recognition
Certificates. I already have a piece of paper. ``This certificate
is awarded as a testimonial of honest and faithful service,'' it
says. My honorable discharge.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This is the time of year _ just as Americans are
grousing over their tax returns _ when Republicans and their allies
try to stoke the flames of tax rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Come mid-April, they like to re-enact the Boston Tea Party,
America's original tax revolt, or stage mock funerals for the tax
code or toss the thick tomes that contain the nation's tax laws
into trash cans. This year, the National Federation of Independent
Business, a lobbying group for small business, is planning to hand
out aspirin at post offices to last-minute tax filers.
</P>
<P>
   But these stunts seem only to highlight what's missing: the kind
of grass-roots uprising that inspired California's Proposition 13
restrictions on property taxes and swept Ronald Reagan into office
nearly two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   This public quiescence is puzzling to the proponents of tax
relief who think that now more than ever it is the time for
significant tax cutting or an overhaul of the tax code. They point
to the fact that federal tax receipts, which are estimated to reach
$1.8 trillion by the end of the federal fiscal year this October,
will amount to 20.6 percent of the gross domestic product. That is
a level unmatched since World War II. They also argue that the
federal surpluses that began appearing last year after a decade of
deficits make the idea of sweeping tax cuts feasible again.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, however, appear to have turned their political
energies and interests elsewhere. It is not that they would reject
a tax cut. A private poll that the National Republican
Congressional Committee distributed to House Republicans at a
retreat in February found that 67 percent of Americans favored a
tax reduction of 10 percent across the board.
</P>
<P>
   But voters seemed more ambivalent about tax cuts when they were
asked how they wanted the government to use the federal surplus.
Given a list of options, 31 percent of those polled said they
wanted the money devoted to Social Security, 26 percent to reducing
the national debt and only 18 percent to tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans are now telling Americans they don't
have to choose. They argue that the Republican budget plan for the
new fiscal year will protect Social Security funds and still have
money left over for tax cuts that grow to $800 billion over a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts say it is economic expansion that has
decreased the public interest in tax cutting. The unemployment rate
is nearing a 29-year low, and the flush times have left most
Americans with money in their pockets and blunted the
anti-government animus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you have good times it makes it harder for tax cutters
like myself and Republicans to make the case you're being bit in
the wallet,'' said Stephen Moore, an economist with the Cato
Institute, a conservative research center. ``Ronald Reagan wouldn't
have been elected in 1980 with the tax cut proposal if we weren't
in a time of economic crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   But in charting the change in attitudes, it is also instructive
to remember the nature of the 1970s economic crisis. That was when
President Gerald Ford made ``Whip Inflation Now'' his motto. When
Howard Jarvis caught the imaginations of Californians and propelled
Proposition 13 to victory in 1978, double-digit inflation was
pushing taxpayers into higher brackets unaccompanied by any real
increase in income. It was also increasing the assessed values of
their homes _ prompting higher property taxes. The biggest victims
were lower- and middle-income Americans, who could be easily moved
into higher tax brackets.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Reagan's 1981 tax act not only cut taxes, it
indexed tax brackets, adjusting them so that inflation alone would
not push people into higher brackets even if they had seen no real
increase in their income.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the irritants in the tax system, like inflation
pushing people up through brackets, have been taken care of now,''
said Iris Lav, the deputy director of the Center on Budget and
Policy Priorities, a liberal non-profit research group.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, inflation nearly disappeared. And instead of
viewing their home as their most important nest egg, many
middle-class Americans are now relying on investments and 401k
plans _ wealth that is not taxed until the stocks are sold.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the lack of rebellion is that the tax burden
is not shared equally. Because of the deficit reduction plans of
1990 and 1993, the rich are paying a larger share of federal taxes
than before. But the tax burden on the middle class and working
class has decreased. Examining an array of taxes, the Congressional
Budget Office found that the 20 percent of families at the middle
of the nation's income scale earned an average income of $38,400 in
1995 and paid 20.2 percent of that in federal taxes. This year,
this group is projected to earn $45,100 on average and pay 18.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Such tax trends have led Americans to look beyond the present.
``We're in a period now where in a variety of fronts, particularly
education, Social Security and Medicare, Americans actually want
government to do something,'' said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic
pollster. ``They are not willing to sacrifice government's ability
to deal with those problems for the sake of a tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosperity has even caused some Republicans to question the
supply-siders, who still hold enormous intellectual sway in their
party. ``Republicans have always been dominated by supply-siders
who said, `cut taxes' at every possible moment,'' said Rep. Joe
Scarborough, R-Fla. ``The lesson of '95 and '96 has been if you cut
federal spending, the markets respond, interest rates drop and the
economy explodes that way, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what you call that,'' Scarborough said. ``It's
not Keynesian. It's not supply side. Maybe its Greenspan
economics.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, even without a tax rebellion, it is likely that
Congress will enact some kind of tax relief this year. President
Clinton now uses the tax code as his chosen instrument of social
policy instead of direct-spending programs. His budget proposed tax
credits for child and health care amounting to $4.1 billion in tax
reductions in fiscal 2000 and $32.6 billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, who are determined to put new muscle in what has
long been their signature issue, have proposed a modest $15 billion
in tax cuts for 2000 growing to $800 billion over a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``My rule of politics is nobody ever lost an election by cutting
taxes,'' said Moore. ``It's always a good bread-and-butter issue
for the Republican Party.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This is the time of year _ just as Americans are
grousing over their tax returns _ when Republicans and their allies
try to stoke the flames of tax rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Come mid-April, they like to re-enact the Boston Tea Party,
America's original tax revolt, or stage mock funerals for the tax
code or toss the thick tomes that contain the nation's tax laws
into trash cans. This year, the National Federation of Independent
Business, a lobbying group for small business, is planning to hand
out aspirin at post offices to last-minute tax filers.
</P>
<P>
   But these stunts seem only to highlight what's missing: the kind
of grass-roots uprising that inspired California's Proposition 13
restrictions on property taxes and swept Ronald Reagan into office
nearly two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   This public quiescence is puzzling to the proponents of tax
relief who think that now more than ever it is the time for
significant tax cutting or an overhaul of the tax code. They point
to the fact that federal tax receipts, which are estimated to reach
$1.8 trillion by the end of the federal fiscal year this October,
will amount to 20.6 percent of the gross domestic product. That is
a level unmatched since World War II. They also argue that the
federal surpluses that began appearing last year after a decade of
deficits make the idea of sweeping tax cuts feasible again.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, however, appear to have turned their political
energies and interests elsewhere. It is not that they would reject
a tax cut. A private poll that the National Republican
Congressional Committee distributed to House Republicans at a
retreat in February found that 67 percent of Americans favored a
tax reduction of 10 percent across the board.
</P>
<P>
   But voters seemed more ambivalent about tax cuts when they were
asked how they wanted the government to use the federal surplus.
Given a list of options, 31 percent of those polled said they
wanted the money devoted to Social Security, 26 percent to reducing
the national debt and only 18 percent to tax relief.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Meeting in February to review interest rate policy,
members of the Federal Reserve fretted, as they always do, about
the possible resurgence of inflation. But their discussion soon
turned to whether the central bank's system of spotting incipient
wage and price pressures might be malfunctioning.
</P>
<P>
   This early-warning system _ built around interrelationships
between unemployment, growth and inflation _ assumes that when
joblessness falls below a certain ``natural'' level, prices will
rise. As a forecasting and policy-making tool, the framework
provided a reasonably accurate way of knowing when inflation would
strike and enabling the Fed to head it off by adjusting monetary
policy. At least until the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment has been falling for seven years, and in March it
dipped to 4.2 percent, its lowest level in nearly three decades and
well below any mainstream estimate of the natural unemployment
rate. Economic growth, while slowing somewhat, remains robust. Yet
the predicted inflation is nowhere to be found. And although
theoretical economists have been debating the issue of a natural
rate for years, concern about the concept's reliability now are
beginning to change the way the Fed thinks about inflation and sets
policy.
</P>
<P>
   The sketchy minutes of the central bank's February meeting _ the
only account made public _ suggest that even Fed officials are
struggling to find answers. The combination ``over an extended
period of strong economic growth, very low rates of unemployment,
and the absence of any buildup of inflation could not be explained
in terms of normal historical relationships,'' the minutes said.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Fed officials, according to the minutes, ``suggested
that the inflation process was not well understood and that
inflation forecasts were subject to a wide range of uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed does not understand the inflation process? It is like a
conference of top cardiac surgeons deciding that it did not really
know how the heart works, or NASA admitting that it was not sure
what happens when the countdown reaches zero.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists believe that since the Fed has less confidence
in its ability to predict inflation, it will be less likely to act
pre-emptively against inflation _ its strategy through much of the
last several decades _ and more likely to wait for evidence that
wage and price increases are actually accelerating.
</P>
<P>
   The natural-rate theory, which is encompassed in such arcane
concepts as the Phillips Curve and the non-accelerating inflation
rate of unemployment, still has its advocates, including some Fed
officials. Even skeptics acknowledge that there is a long-term
tradeoff between unemployment and inflation. The question is
whether the tradeoffs are consistent enough in a rapidly changing
economy to be of any use in predicting inflation and setting
interest rates at the appropriate level.
</P>
<P>
   ``These various road maps or rules that we use are valid at
times,'' said L. Douglas Lee, chief economist at HSBC Securities.
``But what you always have to remember is that the U.S. economy is
a very dynamic creature and things don't remain fixed. What works
at one point in terms of understanding inflation may not work at
another, but then may change and work again.''
</P>
<P>
   The trick for policy-makers, Lee said, is to remain flexible and
to recognize when their old assumptions are no longer working _
something that he and many other economists credit Fed Chairman
Alan Greenspan with doing well in the last few years. Greenspan has
consistently resisted pressure to raise rates over the past few
years just because the old models have been sending warnings
signals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Policy-makers have to keep on top of what's going on, so they
don't use the old road map on a new road,'' Lee said. ``We've had
quite a lengthy period of time now where the economy has grown
faster and inflation has been less than the Fed's forecast
expected. The longer the economy surprises you, the more you have
to question your fundamental assumptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists have offered a raft of explanations for the apparent
breakdown in the old relationships between employment, growth and
inflation, some suggesting that the change is temporary, others
seeing it as emblematic of a fundamental shift in the way the
economy works.
</P>
<P>
   Those in the fundamental change camp, which includes an
increasing number of Fed officials, say that inflation is being
dampened by improved productivity in American business. Faced with
a shortage of labor, employers are paying somewhat higher wages.
But because of intense competition, at home and abroad, they are
unable to pass on the higher costs to consumers. So they are
investing heavily in computers and other cost-saving equipment, and
re-examining the way they operate to reduce expenses at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   Although the statistics are fuzzy, economists increasingly
believe that the result has been the first lasting improvement in
productivity _ output per worker _ since it inexplicably turned
down in the early 1970s. Higher productivity means the economy can
sustain higher rates of non-inflationary growth.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship of inflation to unemployment, Greenspan told
Congress earlier this year, ``is clearly a far more complex
process'' than implied by the natural-rate concept. ``At some
point,'' he said, ``the general notion that a different type of
process is involved here is going to probably gain, in my judgment,
a majority view among economists.''

   CINCINNATI _ Faced with a long prison term and financial ruin,
Michael Gallagher did what criminals routinely do in such
circumstances: He cut a deal with prosecutors, swapping
incriminating information against someone else for leniency and a
lighter sentence.
</P>
<P>
   But Gallagher was not just another white-collar miscreant or
small-time hoodlum. He was an investigative reporter who had worked
for Cincinnati's dominant newspaper, The Enquirer. His decision to
reveal the name of a confidential source, along with notes,
documents and secretly taped conversations, is echoing through the
legal and journalistic communities as a major assault on the
revered principle of protecting sources. And the case is raising
questions about the legal rights of sources who are burned by
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Most legal precedents on this subject involve efforts to protect
confidential sources in the face of attempts by prosecutors or
others to force disclosure of their names. Indeed, it is something
of a badge of honor among journalists to go to jail _ or promise to
_ rather than identify a source.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher had promised his source, George Ventura, a former
lawyer for Chiquita Brands International, that he would go to jail
rather than reveal that Ventura had helped him gain access to
Chiquita's voice-mail system, according to evidence disclosed last
week. But in the end, Gallagher struck a deal with prosecutors and
identified Ventura. Now it is Ventura who faces the prospect of
going to jail. He is charged with violations of Ohio's electronic
communication privacy law and unauthorized access to a computer. If
convicted, could be sentenced to as much as 12{ years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Kovach, curator of the Nieman Foundation at Harvard
University, said Gallagher's actions were unfortunate for all
journalists. ``In throwing over a source, he has given up the right
to ever claim to be a journalist,'' Kovach said. ``His integrity
was on the line and he surrendered it. It hurts the stature of
journalism all around to have someone behave publicly the way
Gallagher has behaved.''
</P>
<P>
   That view was echoed by Jane Kirtley, the executive director of
the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. ``I've dealt with
reporters who would _ and do _ go to jail to protect sources, so
this is a very painful case,'' Ms. Kirtley said. ``It smacks of
saving your own hide by letting your source take the
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   The rationale for protecting sources is straightforward: Often
the only way to obtain information about criminal wrongdoing,
corporate mismanagement or public corruption is by promising
anonymity to someone who has information about those matters.
</P>
<P>
   In an affidavit filed in the Cincinnati case, Sandra Davidson, a
journalism professor at the University of Missouri, said that if a
reporter does not keep a promise of confidentiality, sources will
dry up and so will the flow of information. ``That chilling effect,
however, will not stop at that particular journalist, but will also
affect the ability of the journalist's colleagues to gather
information,'' she said. ``If the sources of information dry up,
then the functioning of the whole system collapses.''
</P>
<P>
   The initial contact between The Enquirer and Ventura had come in
early October of 1997, several months after Gallagher and another
reporter, Cameron McWhirter, had begun work on the Chiquita
project. Ventura, who had left Chiquita a year earlier, sent an
e-mail message to McWhirter offering to help with the story,
according to testimony and statements in court by Daniel Breyer, a
special prosecutor for Hamilton County.
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, in a taped telephone conversation with
McWhirter, Ventura said, ``You've got to have someone run through
those voice mails,'' according to Breyer. In the same conversation,
Ventura provided secret access codes for the voice mails of at
least two Chiquita lawyers, the prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, the Enquirer published an 18-page special section
challenging the business practices of Chiquita, the huge banana
company based in Cincinnati. But less than two months later, the
newspaper, owned by Gannett Co., published a front-page apology,
agreed to pay Chiquita more than $10 million and fired Gallagher,
its star investigative reporter, saying he had misled his editors.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-September, Gallagher had reached a bargain with the
special prosecutor in which he pleaded guilty to two felonies,
carrying a total sentence of up to 2{ years in prison. To avoid
more extensive charges, he told prosecutors that Ventura had
provided him with access codes to the Chiquita voice-mail system
and agreed to testify against his former source.
</P>
<P>
   McWhirter, who has never identified Ventura or anyone else as a
source, testified that in October 1997 he had passed the voice-mail
access codes on to Gallagher, who quickly used them to gain access
to the voice-mail system 15 to 20 times before being informed by
his editors and lawyers for the newspaper that what he was doing
was probably illegal.
</P>
<P>
   But Gallagher continued to tap into the voice-mail system
without his editors' knowledge, according to his testimony last
week. Gallagher said he believed protecting the identity of a
source is ``one of the highest responsibilities a journalist has.''
He offered no explanation for disclosing Ventura's assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Like many confidential sources, Ventura was a disgruntled former
employee. In an interview last week, he said he had been angered by
Chiquita's treatment of some of its employees while he was working
for the company in Honduras, and that he had quit partly in
protest. But it was also disclosed in court by Breyer that Ventura
had demanded $1.5 million from Chiquita, and had threatened to file
a discrimination complaint and go to the press.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Breyer said, Ventura was suspected of being a
source for the articles even before Gallagher revealed his
identity. Nonetheless, Ventura was not indicted until after the
reporter agreed to cooperate and confirmed Ventura's role to
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   In defending himself against the 10-count indictment returned by
a county grand jury last September, Ventura has taken the unusual
step of invoking Ohio's shield law. He claims that the protection
afforded journalists who refuse to reveal sources should also apply
to the sources. The judge in the case, Ann Marie Tracey, has not
yet ruled on the shield law question. It is an issue for which
there are few legal precedents and little agreement among
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   The law must not only shield the journalist from having to
reveal his or her source,'' said Ms. Davidson, ``but the law must
also shield the source from having his or her identity revealed by
the journalist.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Kirtley sees a danger in extending the protections.
``Allowing a source to use the shield law as a sword to control the
reporter would signal yet another attempt to erode the intent of
shield laws, which is to protect a journalist,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Gallagher, he faces a maximum sentence of 2{ years,
having pleaded guilty to two of what might have been hundreds of
counts. He also faces a civil suit brought by Chiquita. And,
judging from the questions asked in court last week by Ventura's
lawyer, Marc Mezibov, both Gallagher and the Enquirer face the
likelihood of a civil suit by Ventura for breach of contract in
divulging his identity.

   CINCINNATI _ Faced with a long prison term and financial ruin,
Michael Gallagher did what criminals routinely do in such
circumstances: He cut a deal with prosecutors, swapping
incriminating information against someone else for leniency and a
lighter sentence.
</P>
<P>
   But Gallagher was not just another white-collar miscreant or
small-time hoodlum. He was an investigative reporter who had worked
for Cincinnati's dominant newspaper, The Enquirer. His decision to
reveal the name of a confidential source, along with notes,
documents and secretly taped conversations, is echoing through the
legal and journalistic communities as a major assault on the
revered principle of protecting sources. And the case is raising
questions about the legal rights of sources who are burned by
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Most legal precedents on this subject involve efforts to protect
confidential sources in the face of attempts by prosecutors or
others to force disclosure of their names. Indeed, it is something
of a badge of honor among journalists to go to jail _ or promise to
_ rather than identify a source.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher had promised his source, George Ventura, a former
lawyer for Chiquita Brands International, that he would go to jail
rather than reveal that Ventura had helped him gain access to
Chiquita's voice-mail system, according to evidence disclosed last
week. But in the end, Gallagher struck a deal with prosecutors and
identified Ventura. Now it is Ventura who faces the prospect of
going to jail. He is charged with violations of Ohio's electronic
communication privacy law and unauthorized access to a computer. If
convicted, could be sentenced to as much as 12{ years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Kovach, curator of the Nieman Foundation at Harvard
University, said Gallagher's actions were unfortunate for all
journalists. ``In throwing over a source, he has given up the right
to ever claim to be a journalist,'' Kovach said. ``His integrity
was on the line and he surrendered it. It hurts the stature of
journalism all around to have someone behave publicly the way
Gallagher has behaved.''
</P>
<P>
   That view was echoed by Jane Kirtley, the executive director of
the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. ``I've dealt with

this is a very painful case,'' Ms. Kirtley said. ``It smacks of

wine, her face lit up and she began to talk. She told me one of the

for Sunday, April 11, moved Saturday.

</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-ECOSYSTEM-REVIEW (Undated) _ Scientists at the Xerox
Palo Alto Research Center have squeezed a big portion of the Web,
about 55 million pages, onto 400 billion bytes of disk space. Held
in captivity, this Web in a box is poked and prodded by researchers
studying it like a great beast _ or, to use the metaphor they
prefer, like an ecosystem. They seek the laws by which the members
of the planetary community of Internet foragers compete and
cooperate in the constant search for information. The Internet is a
living laboratory to study mass human behavior with a precision and
scale never possible before. By George Johnson. (`a' category)
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-GENOCIDE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Amid growing signs of a
genocidal campaign by Serbian forces against Kosovo's Albanians,
the conduct of ordinary Serbs is starting to attract the kinds of
questions raised in Daniel Jonah Goldhagen's book, `Hitler's
Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust.'
Goldhagen himself thinks that questioning the behavior of the
Serbian nation at this moment is not only fitting but essential. By
Michael T. Kaufman. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-NATO-REVIEW (Brussels) _ NATO has been planning a 50th
anniversary summit this month to chart a new `strategic concept'
defining its role in European security. But that role is instead
being redefined in Kosovo. The role has become that of a bulwark
against the consequences of ethnic instability in Europe's
southeastern periphery, which is today the biggest threat to
European security, just as it was a century ago. If it cannot
resolve the Kosovo crisis, NATO may go the way of the League of
Nations. By Craig R. Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MIDEAST-REVIEW (Damascus) _ NATO's punishment of Serb
Christians for their persecution of Kosovar Muslims presented the
Islamic world with a campaign that it could identify with. After
all, the U.S. and its allies were siding with Muslims this time,
not bashing Iraq or supporting Israel. But while sympathies for the
Kosovars are strong in the Muslim Middle East, they are tangled
with an abiding mistrust of the West, whose use of force against
the Serbs is seen as less than heroic. By Douglas Jehl.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-FUGITIVES-REVIEW (Mexico City) _ A look at the
frequently-occurring phenomenon of Mexican government officials who
are accused of corruption and then flee. There are so many such
cases that, to Mexicans, the public figure turned fugitive has
become a cliche. `In our system, there's a thin line separating
public officials from outlaws, and legality from illegality,' said
poet Homero Aridjis. `Overnight, they can leave behind their
prerogatives of power and turn into fugitives.' By Sam Dillon.
</P>
<P>
   GADHAFI-LOCKERBIE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Sources close to Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi say his agreement to turn over the suspects
in the Lockerbie jetliner bombing was not greatly influenced by
sanctions or other economic pressures. A need to end his isolation
and salvage his place in history may have been the most important
factor. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   COLDWAR-HEROES-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Cold War Recognition
Certificate took its place in the pantheon of military honors last
week, when the Pentagon began accepting applications. Anyone who
served in the armed forces or in one of several federal government
positions between Sept. 2, 1945, when Japan surrendered to the
U.S., and Dec. 25, 1991, when Mikhail Gorbachev resigned as
president of the Soviet Union, is eligible to apply. The
certificate could go to as many as 22 million people. It carries no
financial benefits or privileges whatever _ but, oh, the glory! By
David Stout.
</P>
<P>
   TAX-CUT-REVIEW (Washington) _ Recent public quiescence on the
issue of taxes is puzzling to conservatives who think that the time
is ripe for significant tax cutting or a sweeping overhaul of the
tax code. But Americans appear to have turned their political
energies and interests elsewhere. Although they would not reject a
tax cut, polls indicate many would prefer the money be dedicated to
Social Security or other programs. So congressional Republicans
have been working to tell Americans that they don't have to choose.
By Alison Mitchell. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   ECON-JOBLESS-REVIEW (Washington) Unemployment has been falling
for seven years and economic growth remains robust. By conventional
economic theory, this should be producing inflation. But in fact,
inflation is nowhere to be found. And while theoretical economists
have been debating the issue for years, doubts about this
conventional wisdom on unemployment are now are beginning to change
the way the Federal Reserve sets policy. By Richard W. Stevenson.

<P>
   CONFIDENTIAL-SOURCES-REVIEW (Cincinnati) _ Cincinnati Enquirer
reporter Mike Gallagher's decision to reveal the identity of a
confidential source, along with notes, documents and secretly taped
conversations, is echoing through the legal and journalistic
communities as a major assault on the revered principle of
protecting sources. The case is raising new questions about the
legal rights of sources who are burned by journalists. By Douglas
Frantz.
</P>
<P>
   ENTREPRENEUR-ADS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Get-rich-quick schemes
have been around a long time. But with this era's remarkable
economic expansion and concurrent growth of home-based businesses,
magazines that cater to small-scale entrepreneurs lately have
become thick with ads placing the home business smack dab on the
road to Easy Street.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week, leading
with Mark McGwire's first home run of the season and John Gotti's
plea bargain.

   KOSOVO (Coded `i')
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-RDP (Brussels, Belgium) _ Lede-all: With NATO bombing of
Yugoslavia now in its 17th day, a senior allied diplomat said here
Saturday that the alliance was prepared to continue air attacks
``for many more weeks'' but that the idea of using ground troops
was not being seriously discussed. By Craig R. Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   EXCLUSIVE-DOWNED-F117 (Washington) _ Ever since a U.S. Air Force
F-117 was downed over Yugoslavia on March 27, Pentagon officials
have puzzled over what could have brought down one of the world's
stealthiest warplanes. Two weeks later, after extensive interviews
with the pilot, a review of technical clues and an analysis of how
the Serbian air defenses have been operating, a secret Air Force
inquiry now believes a combination of tactics, quick learning and
luck came together in one brilliant moment to shoot down the
premier attack jet in America's arsenal. ``We think whoever did
this won the lotto that night,'' said one senior American officer.
By Eric Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-BELGRADE (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ More than 300 civilians
have died and nearly 3,000 have been wounded from the NATO bombing
attacks on Yugoslavia that began March 24, a senior Yugoslav
official said in an interview Saturday. They are the first and most
concrete figures for civilian casualties to emerge since the air
strikes began, although they cannot be independently confirmed. By
Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-ALBANIA (Kukes, Albania) _ The interior of Kosovo is a
wasteland of burned villages and wandering farm animals, refugees
allowed to cross the border overnight said Saturday, its landscape
empty of ethnic Albanians and swarming with Serb troops on the
move. ``It's a desert, what we have seen,'' said Jakup Slamnku, 41,
one of about 1,500 refugees. By John Kifner.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MONTENEGRO (Podgorica, Montenegro) _ Under Yugoslav law,
Dragon Soc's refusal to join the Yugoslav Army makes him subject to
imprisonment as a draft dodger. Soc ought to know. He is the
minister of justice for the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro. And
his draft dodging is part of a power struggle here that Western
governments fear could spill over into civil war. By Blaine Harden.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-SUMMIT (Washington) _ In two weeks, the largest summit in
U.S. history will convene as presidents, prime ministers, soldiers
and statesmen of 42 nations mark NATO's past glories and bright
promise. But how can you throw a party with war in the Balkans and
refugees flooding southeastern Europe? By Tim Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-ORTHODOX (Moscow) _ As Orthodox Christians from Moscow to
Belgrade, from Athens to Bucharest start celebrating Easter at
midnight services Saturday night, the usual joy of this most sacred
of holidays has been tinged with feelings of unease, grief, fear
and anger over the continuing conflict in Yugoslavia, home of their
Orthodox brethren, the Serbs. By Celestine Bohlen.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-HISTORY (Berlin) _ Having provided the key to his rise to
power, Kosovo has the potential to be Slobodan Milosevic's nemesis.
By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-CAMPUS (New Brunswick, N.J.) _ When Rutgers University
organized a ``teach-in'' on the hundreds of years of Balkan
conflict, they expected 80 students but wound up with more than
400. It was a sign of how a fascination with Kosovo has touched
several of the nation's college campuses, as this apolitical,
post-Cold War generation tunes in to foreign conflict. By Mike
Allen.
</P>
<P>
   OTHER INTERNATIONAL (Coded `i')
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-SEX (Beijing) _ As far as sex goes, the Chinese have a lot
of catching up to do. For three decades the Communist Party branded
recreational sex a bourgeois pastime; prostitution and sexually
transmitted diseases quickly disappeared. That 30-year vacuum in
part explains the proliferation of sex education courses, where
young Chinese learn about sex from scratch, often with the same
earnestness that they study computers. By Elisabeth Rosenthal.
</P>
<P>
   SAFRICA-WINNIE (Soweto, South Africa) _ To those who wrote
Winnie Madikizela-Mandela's political obituary a couple years back:
look again. By Suzanne Daley.
</P>
<P>
   ITALY-CLERGY-CONTRIBUTIONS (Rome) _ Contributions to sustain the
Roman Catholic clergy has steadily declined in Italy, and some
blame the scandal surrounding Cardinal Michele Giordano, the
archbishop of Naples, who is being investigated on allegations of
usury and extortion. By Alessandra Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   U.N.-WOMEN-POPULATION (United Nations) _ A consensus reached at
a 180-nation conference in Cairo five years ago on a new strategy
for limiting world population growth by improving the status of
women is now facing serious religious, ideological and financial
difficulties. By Paul Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   TRADE-ASSESS (Washington) _ There are two basic types of trade
disputes, one involving attempts to open another country's markets,
the other centered on protecting industries at home that have been
battered by global competition. The Clinton administration's effort
to negotiate a deal that would bring China into the global trading
system spans both. But neither the White House nor Congress nor
even the Republican or Democratic Parties themselves have resolved
those conflicting pressures on the question of China or in trade
policy more generally. By Richard W. Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL (Coded `a')
</P>
<P>
   JUVENILE-CRIME (Little Rock, Ark.) _ Something unexpected
happened in the year since two boys in Jonesboro, Ark., shot up a
schoolyard, killing five people and riveting a nation. Though many
residents were furious that a harsh punishment could not be imposed
on the killers, officials did not write a law that simply moves
children into the adult justice system. Instead, state leaders
brought in child development specialists, consulted with both
prosecutors and defense lawyers, and came up with a far more
tempered bill than anyone had expected. By David Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   TOBACCO-LAWSUIT (Albany, N.Y.) _ The court fight over New York's
share of the national tobacco settlement _ a battle primarily
between Gov. George Pataki and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani _ threatens
to delay distribution of the money for all 46 of the states
involved, lawyers and advocates involved in the settlement say. By
Richard Perez-Pena.
</P>
<P>
   HOGS-MUSIC-LAWSUIT (Stewart, Fla.) _ It's a confrontation of old
and new Florida, here in this corner of Martin County about 30
minutes north of Palm Beach. The Florida Club, a golf course and
subdivision with homes that sell for around $300,000, is suing two
pig farmers, claiming that the country music the two play bothers
its golfers. The farmers swear the music improves the hogs'
disposition. By Rick Bragg.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-GAS-PRICES (Los Angeles) _ High gas prices have
Californians fuming. By Christian Berthelsen.
</P>
<P>
   NY-GIRLS-SCHOOLS (New York) _ Arlene Gibson, the headmistress at
Spence, remembers the bad old days, the early '90s, when girls'
schools had to convince parents of the benefits of single-sex
education. Now, most of Manhattan's seven private girls' schools
had 10 applications for every $17,000-plus kindergarten opening for
this coming fall, more than the average for New York's private
schools. And the only public girls' school in New York City has
also been deluged with applications. By Tamar Lewin.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON  &LR; (coded `w')
</P>
<P>
   EDWARDS-FCC (Washington ) _ Eddie Edwards, Sr., is a successful
black entreprenuer who owns eight television stations across the

<P>
   SOWETO, South Africa _ To those who wrote Winnie
Madikizela-Mandela's political obituary a couple of years back:
Look again.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, President Nelson Mandela's former wife took a beating
at hearings of the country's Truth and Reconciliation Commission
and then suffered an embarrassing defeat in her bid for the deputy
presidency of the African National Congress. She got fewer than 150
votes from more than 2,000 delegates.
</P>
<P>
   But when the African National Congress published its list of
candidates in late February, she was in the No. 10 spot, a position
that acknowledges her popularity and that virtually assures she
will be returned to Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   In case the next generation of party officials should
underestimate her support, her recent appearance at a campaign
rally here upstaged the man most likely to be the country's next
president: Thabo Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
   The ups and downs of Mrs. Madikizela-Mandela's private life are
also back in the news: She is locked in a bitter feud with Mandela
over the house where they once lived here and _ in a gesture that
flabbergasted the nation _ she gave away her wedding ring to the
13-year-old daughter of a former security officer who used to spy
on her.
</P>
<P>
   Her prominence on the African National Congress list drew a
storm of attacks from opposition parties who were all too glad to
point out that the ANC had promised to propose only ``clean''
candidates _ those with no history of ill discipline, corruption or
a criminal record of a nonpolitical nature. Mrs. Madikizela-Mandela
has been convicted of assault and kidnapping, and many similar
accusations are still being investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Under the country's system of proportional representation,
voters do not cast votes for candidates but for a party, which
proposes its own candidates. Mrs. Madikizela-Mandela was not the
only ANC candidate on this year's list with a questionable history.
</P>
<P>
   After the list was produced by voting at local levels of the
party, Mbeki, the party leader, said it would be reviewed for
undesirables. But the party also made clear that Mrs.
Madikizela-Mandela would probably survive the culling process: ANC
officials were quick to spring to her defense, saying her behavior
in the past was due to the stresses and hardships she was subjected
to when apartheid-era security forces routinely harassed her.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition parties, however, countered that even her
post-apartheid behavior was questionable. Mrs. Madikizela-Mandela,
who leads the ANC's Women's League and is a member of Parliament,
rarely attends sessions or makes any contributions. She also owes
thousands of dollars to the government for unauthorized trips, cell
phones and cars.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, she created a stir when it came to light that she was
traveling on a diplomatic passport, though she may no longer be
entitled to one. The subject came up when, on private business, she
tried to board a British Air flight to London with more than $1,500
in excess baggage. She could not pay the fees, and other
first-class passengers helped her pay the excess, it was widely
reported here. She wrote a furious letter to the airline management
demanding she be reimbursed.
</P>
<P>
   Her popularity, however, seems unquestionable.
</P>
<P>
   From the urban sprawl in Soweto to the rural areas of the
country's Kwa-Zulu/Natal province, Mrs. Madikizela-Mandela has
shown she can draw a crowd. She is a veteran politician, seen one
week in a church choir holding a Bible, the next bringing boxes of
food and donated clothing to crime victims. Yet within the party
she is seen as something of a loose cannon.
</P>
<P>
   Of late she has been toeing the party line, however, praising
Mbeki and predicting that he will have the brains and the will to
rid the country of crime and bring jobs to the millions of
unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say that her prominence on the candidates list is
a strategic move by the ANC to make sure that she does not leave
the party to start her own or to join her longtime friend Bantu
Holomisa and his fast-growing new United Democratic Movement.
</P>
<P>
   At the official opening of the ANC campaign in Soweto in March,
Mrs. Madikizela-Mandela stole the show. She arrived 45 minutes
late, as Mbeki was reading his speech. But the crowd cheered and
yelled so much that he had to stop to acknowledge her with a
traditional salute, ``Viva the president of the African National
Congress Women's League.'' Even then, however, the crowd kept
cheering and Mbeki labored through much of his speech unheard.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela, who was also at the event, did not even greet his
former wife. Apparently, the two are back in court over the
four-room house here, where they lived together before he was sent
to prison for 27 years.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the house has been under Mrs. Madikizela-Mandela's
control, and two years ago she opened it as a museum, charging a $2
entry fee. She raised eyebrows when she also encouraged visitors to
buy small vials of dirt from the property for $8. The dirt came in
a box labeled ``Heroes Acre.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a few months, Mandela, who exercised his right to buy the
house from the government in 1997, gave it to the Soweto Heritage
Trust, a foundation that oversees some of Soweto's other landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   Now Mandela and the trust are moving to evict Mrs.
Madikizela-Mandela, and she is countersuing, contending that her
rights to buy the house, on Vilakazi Street in the Orlando West
section of Soweto, were ignored. The house is one of hundreds of
identical houses built for blacks under the apartheid government.
</P>
<P>
   While she may want the house, Mrs. Mandela is shedding other
memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, she gave away the wedding ring that Mandela
had given her, calling it a gesture of reconciliation. She gave the
gold ring with two diamonds to the 13-year-old daughter of a former
security policeman, Paul Erasmus. Erasmus admitted during a Truth
and Reconciliation Commission hearing into Mrs.
Madikizela-Mandela's role in Soweto violence before 1990 that he
had spied on her and had taken part in efforts to spread malicious
information about her.
</P>
<P>
   But the two have remained friends. Mrs. Madikizela-Mandela gave
the ring to Candice Erasmus when she was attending a birthday party
for one of Mrs. Madikizela-Mandela's children. Erasmus said the
ring would be kept in trust and probably donated to a museum one
day.

   GUNS-RING (Los Angeles) _ When deputies stopped a Ford Bronco at
a crowded West Hollywood nightclub, TV actor Omar Gooding was
behind the wheel and three handguns with erased serial numbers were
on the seat. Using new, sophisticated technology, ATF agents
painstakingly traced back the guns to more than 1,200 an illegal
immigrant bought using a forged gun dealer's license. That led them
to a 365-pound Los Angeles man and two other illegal dealers who
had sold the guns to San Fernando Valley gangs, the Mexican Mafia,
drive-by shooters, a bank robber _ and Gooding. By Greg Gittrich.

   KOSOVA-DEJAVU (Los Angeles) _ Silvia Martin can barely stand to
watch the TV news images of huddled refugees driven from their

terror. ``It's us all over again. When I see a young girl I think,
`I was there too,''' said Martin, an 80-year-old Hollywood resident
who was sent to Auschwitz at age 22. Among Holocaust survivors,
reactions like Martin's to the scenes of the Kosovo crisis are
common, say psychologist who treat them. A European campaign of
``ethnic cleansing'' starkly evokes the Nazi era and is taking its
toll on many elderly survivors. By Sharline Chiang. (Will move in

CHARITY PLEA IN ITALY DRAWS MONEY TO PAY PRIESTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Using stark images of sick and starving children, the
Roman Catholic Church in Italy is beginning its annual fund-raising
drive.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday and Monday, Italian television will be flooded with
90-second commercials produced by the Milan-based advertising
agency Saatchi and Saatchi.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements movingly convey the efforts of Catholic
missionaries to relieve suffering around the world. What the
advertising campaign, which cost $3.3 million, does not make clear
is that almost half of the money raised by the church does not go
to help Kosovo refugees, Guatemalan orphans or Somali single
mothers but to pay the salaries of Italy's 38,000 priests.
</P>
<P>
   And that does not please Italy's bishops. ``If we are forced to
use 50 percent of our money to sustain the clergy, then obviously
we have less money to spend on charity work at home and abroad,''
said Bishop Attilio Nicora, head of legal affairs for the Italian
Conference of Bishops, which is responsible for fund raising.
``Italians are very generous, but we are having a hard time trying
to give a more orderly orientation to their generosity.''
</P>
<P>
   Italians have been especially generous to Kosovo refugees. To
date, they have donated more than $8 million to the government's
Kosovo relief project, ``Rainbow.'' The Catholic relief
organization Caritas has been so deluged with clothes, blankets and
food that organizers had to appeal to donors to hold back for now.
</P>
<P>
   Nicora said that while donations to Catholic Church charities
had grown steadily over the last few years, contributions earmarked
to sustain the clergy had declined just as steadily.
</P>
<P>
   He blamed priests' reluctance to ask for help, as well as
Italians' instinctive mistrust of large institutions, including the
Rome-based Central Institute of Support to the Clergy, which
collects money for priests' salaries.
</P>
<P>
   But some Catholics also detect a link between the drop in
contributions to the clergy and the scandal surrounding Cardinal
Michele Giordano, the archbishop of Naples, who is being
investigated by state prosecutors on allegations of usury and
extortion.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican has steadfastly supported Giordano, lodging a formal
complaint with the Italian government after prosecutors raided his
office in August, a step it viewed as a violation of church
sovereignty. But in an unusual display of openness the latest issue
of Sovvenire, a church magazine distributed to those who donate to
the clergy, published letters from angry readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always contributed money to sustain the clergy,''
Gianfranco Pederzoll, a donor from the outskirts of Milan, wrote.
``But I won't do it as long as Cardinal Giordano manages church
funds to ends which we all know.''
</P>
<P>
   An unsigned editorial urged readers not to rush to judgment, but
the fact that the magazine aired the grievances was in itself a
sign of dismay within the church.
</P>
<P>
   Nicora said he did not believe that there was a link between
Giordano's legal troubles, which began last summer, and the drop in
direct contributions to priests' salaries, which fell from $25
million in 1994 to $23.75 million in 1997 and $23 million last
year. ``Unfortunately we have witnessed a slow, progressive decline
that is continuous, but not clamorous,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The U.S. Constitution bans government subsidies to religious
organizations. In some European countries, such as Germany and
Austria, the state subsidizes parochial schools. In Italy, a
country where Catholicism was the state religion until 1984, the
sometimes hazy division of church and state remains a thorny issue
for many.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the Italian government instituted a system whereby
taxpayers could earmark .8 percent of their taxes for a variety of
charitable entities. Forty-six percent of Italy's 30 million
taxpayers do check off that box, and most _ 82.5 percent _ choose
to give it to the Catholic Church. Last year the church took in
more than $700 million from that source.
</P>
<P>
   The church separately seeks donations for priests' salaries,
soliciting year-end contributions that are rewarded by a small tax
deduction. Only 159,000 Italians opted to make such a donation last
year, and the $23 million collected covered only 5 percent of the
cost of paying priests. The church had to cover the rest by using
money originally intended to go to religious work and charity
efforts at home and overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``People prefer to give to local charities or causes that they
feel emotionally,'' Nicora said. ``Giving money over to a central
institution based in Rome is harder. People have to be very
educated in church affairs to make that leap.'' He added,
``Unfortunately, we have not been very successful in nurturing such
sentiments in many people.''

ANALYSIS: TRADE DEBATE SHOWS FRICTIONS OF SHRINKING WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There are two basic types of trade disputes, one
involving attempts to open another country's markets, the other
centered on protecting industries at home that have been battered
by global competition.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's efforts to negotiate a deal that
would bring China into the global trading system spans both. But
neither the White House nor Congress nor even the Republican or
Democratic parties themselves have resolved those conflicting
pressures, on the question of China or in trade policy more
generally.
</P>
<P>
   Opening China to U.S. commerce would, for instance, be a boon in
many ways to the United States, and it is therefore attractive to
supporters of free trade and many business interests.
</P>
<P>
   But doing it in a way that leaves even a relatively small number
of American jobs exposed to China's unpolished but very real
economic might could create a political backlash that would doom
approval of the deal by a Congress already predisposed to view
China with suspicion if not hostility.
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, the debate over how to deal with China
encapsulates the broader question of how governments can manage the
process of integrating their markets without unduly fueling
political and social tensions at home.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to break down foreign trade barriers are generally
driven by the idea that prying open new markets creates jobs and
profits. Efforts to shield domestic industries are usually inspired
by raw political pressure from companies and workers suffering the
effects of economic changes an ocean or continent away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten to a stage where the issue isn't just how to
liberalize trade, but how to adjudicate disputes about what's
enough, what is socially justifiable, how you reconcile systems
that are based on different types of institutions and different
cultures,'' said Jeffrey Garten, dean of the Yale School of
Management and a former Clinton administration trade official.
</P>
<P>
   Even without China, the United States is engaged in a wide
spectrum of trade disputes. The issues being fought with the
European Union alone touch on a broad range of products and
services. Washington is pressing Europe to drop its ban on
importing beef from hormone-treated cattle. It is battling to make
it easier for a U.S. company to export bananas to Europe. It is
squabbling with Europe over standards for computer privacy.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there is considerable pressure from Congress
to do something about the plight of U.S. steelmakers, which have
suffered from a flood of low-cost imports from Russia, Asia and
other parts of the world. Last month the House voted 289-141 to
limit steel imports, bringing together members of both parties from
states where jobs have been endangered by what they consider unfair
competition.
</P>
<P>
   There are also smoldering bipartisan efforts in Congress to take
steps to help textile makers, another politically powerful interest
group that has faced wrenching upheaval as commerce has become more
global.
</P>
<P>
   The crosscurrents can be difficult for politicians to navigate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trade votes ripple through labor, business, human rights and
foreign policy,'' said Rep. Tim Roemer, D-Ind. ``They touch a lot
of nerves and a lot of bases. It used to be, when I first got to
Congress in the early 1990s, that abortion and gun control were the
most intense votes. Now it's often trade votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Roemer voted to curb steel imports last month, which free-trade
purists would call protectionist. But he said he supports bringing
China into the World Trade Organization as long as the United
States can be assured the deal will be fair.
</P>
<P>
   Roemer's was precisely the kind of swing vote that President
Clinton had in mind when he walked away from an all-but-completed
trade deal on Thursday with China's prime minister, Zhu Rongji.
Concluding that he could never get the deal through Congress
without more explicit concessions _ despite substantial concessions
from China on other key issues _ Clinton opted to gamble that
further negotiations would yield progress rather than a backlash
from the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president gauged this on the substance of the concessions
by the Chinese, on which they need to give more on textiles, steel,
automobiles and telecommunications, as well as on the political
climate,'' Roemer said after meeting on Friday with Zhu. ``He's
trying to live up to what we're seeking, which is both free trade
and fair trade.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that it is becoming increasingly difficult for
nations to agree on what is fair.
</P>
<P>
   The international body at the heart of the negotiation with
China _ the World Trade Organization _ was set up to work out rules
for global commerce and judge its members' compliance. As might be
expected of any institution built on the presumption that nations
benefit from voluntarily ceding some of their sovereignty, the
trade organization has had a rocky first few years.
</P>
<P>
   Its role is likely to become even more contentious as more
countries with developing economies like that of China _ the
largest country still outside the system _ are allowed in and try
to mesh their domestic realities with a still unsettled global
norm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coming battles are over differences in economic systems
and political preferences,'' Garten said. ``The extent of trade has
become too massive and too complex for problems to be resolved
between two countries. Someone is going to have to be in the
middle, and all we have is the WTO.''
</P>
<P>
   The bad news, Garten said, is that the organization is
inexperienced and unproved. The good news, he added, is that it
seems to be set up to deal effectively with international disputes
and that, from a parochial perspective, its rulings so far have
tended to favor the United States.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Garten said, China and the United States alike _
as well as every other trading nation _ need an outside arbiter as
a bulwark against the kinds of domestic political pressures that
could otherwise stall progress on trade issues or lead to the
system's unraveling.
</P>
<P>
   Garten used the example of Mexico, whose government has resisted
intense internal pressures for protectionism in recent years by
pointing to the country's international commitments under the trade
organization and the North American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The politics of it is that those who are hurt by trade always
scream first and loudest,'' Garten said. ``But if you are bound by
some kind of international treaty, then there is a rallying point
for those who want to see trade continue.''

HORRORS IN KOSOVO REVIVE PAST FOR HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY SHARLINE CHIANG  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sixty years after Joseph Neustadt's family died in
the Holocaust, the suffering of the past has come back, as he sees
the haunting images of ``ethnic cleansing'' in Yugoslavia, of
Kosovar refugees driven from their homes by Serbian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cry every time I see it,'' Neustadt, 71, of Los Angeles,
said last week. ``It's terrible. It reminds me of what happened to
us in the Holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Martin, who fled on foot from Nazi terror but ended up in
Auschwitz at the age of 22, also has revisited the horror of the
past in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's us all over again. When I see a young girl I think, I was
there too,'' said Martin, 80, a native of Austria who now lives in
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Among Holocaust survivors, such reactions to the scenes of the
Kosovo crisis are common, say psychologists who treat survivors of
genocide. A European campaign of ethnic cleansing starkly evokes
the Nazi era and is taking its toll on many elderly survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Portney, a psychiatrist in Santa Monica, has been
treating Holocaust survivors and relatives for about 25 years. He
says patients began to report distress about the genocide in the
former Yugoslavia from the early 1990s when violence broke out in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   But what's happening in Kosovo is even more disturbing to them,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's starting to have more resemblance to the Nazi Holocaust
as people are being transported and dying on trains that are packed
with people, reports of mass murders,'' said Portney, a psychiatry
professor at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Televised images of the refugees serve as ``traumatic
reminders'' of the past, Portney said. An estimated 80 percent of
Holocaust survivors are believed to suffer from post-traumatic
stress order, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign of ethnic cleansing by the Serbs creates a
particularly sad and ironic context this year for Yom HaShoah,
Holocaust Remembrance Day.
</P>
<P>
   The day was established after the war as a memorial to those who
died in the Holocaust. It commemorates the day according to the
Jewish calendar that Allied troops liberated the first Nazi camp
and this year falls on April 13. Yom HaShoah is often observed with
events promoting tolerance and marked by vows against allowing
history to repeat itself.
</P>
<P>
   What troubles many survivors is the realization that dictators
like Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and campaigns of ethnic
cleansing did not end with the defeat of Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might have thought that Hitler was an anomaly in
history,'' Elliot Dorff, a rector and professor of philosophy at
the University of Judaism in Los Angeles, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``After it's all said and done, he was defeated. And what might
comfort them is that the post-war Germans have denounced what the
Nazis did. But any comfort like that is undermined as soon as one
sees that sort of cleansing is being used with a vengeance in the
Balkans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Martin volunteers at the Shoah Foundation in hopes of
preventing future generations from having to endure what she and
others did. The Los Angeles-based educational foundation was
established by filmmaker Steven Spielberg in 1994 after he made
``Schindler's List.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to keep your morale. We try so hard to teach to the
young people so it won't repeat itself,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there it is in the living room. What is it that makes it
hard for people to learn? What is it that people do not have
respect for humanity?'' she asked, her voice shaking.
</P>
<P>
   Sigi Hart, 73, has been asking himself some of those same
questions. A survivor from Germany now living in the Los Angeles
suburb of Calabasas, he was 14 when the Holocaust started. For
almost two years he survived at Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   Images of Albanians packed onto crowded trains take him back to
one of his own train rides that allowed him and 2,000 others to
escape from Belgium to France.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so terrible to see the people of Kosovo, to see them walk
the mountains,'' Hart said. ``It all comes back to me like a
nightmare.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Despite similarities, several Holocaust survivors also pointed
out tremendous differences between the crisis in Kosovo and their
own experience.
</P>
<P>
   During the Holocaust, the mass murder of European Jews by the
Nazis during World War II, Adolf Hitler planned to wipe out the
entire Jewish population as part of a plan to take over the world.
By the end of the war in 1945, about 6million Jewish men, women and
children _ more than two-thirds of the Jews in Europe _ were
killed. Also killed were many members of other ethnic groups,
especially Gypsies, Poles and Slavs.
</P>
<P>
   The mass killing was organized with industrial efficiency, with
millions dying in gas chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Holocaust survivors are extremely sympathetic to the plight of
Albanians, Hart said. But the fact that NATO has stepped in to stop
Milosevic, that refugees are receiving aid and are being welcomed
by so many nations likely has triggered a tinge of bitterness among
some Holocaust survivors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hart noted how boats filled with Holocaust refugees fleeing
Germany and attempting to seek asylum in the United States were
turned away.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it happened to us, there was nobody there for us. We had
nobody. You cannot compare it to our plight. No way,'' Hart said.
The Serbs ``want them out of the country, but they're not killing
everybody. In our case, it was systematic killing.''

LOS ANGELES: Ammunition shop Investigators believe Sycip clamped each gun into the vice and
ground off the weapons' serial numbers before peddling them to
three main distributors.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The handiwork makes the weapons nearly untraceable and allowed
Sycip to sell the guns for as much as seven times the wholesale
value, federal agents said.
</P>
<P>
   Between October 1995 and March 1996, Sycip had bought 51
packages from a wholesaler in Sparks, Nev., and paid about $36,000
in COD charges for the majority of the weapons, according to United
Parcel Service receipts seized by the agents.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also found records detailing illegal purchases
from a Selma, Ala., gun dealer.
</P>
<P>
   The stockpile consisted of Jennings 9 mm, Jennings .380-caliber,
Sundance .25-caliber and Phoenix Arms &UR;  &LR; Raven .25-caliber handguns _
all made by a ring of notorious gun manufacturers south of Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1996, Sycip pleaded guilty to one count of dealing,
importing and manufacturing firearms without a license. He was
sentenced to 30 months in state prison and two years of supervised
probation, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Borthwick.
</P>
<P>
   Sycip has since returned to the Philippines, but not before
providing agents with a trail to follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept fairly detailed records of all the transactions. He
gave us a pretty clear idea of where the guns were going,''
Borthwick said.
</P>
<P>
   According to federal investigators, Sycip sold slightly more
than 400 weapons to two people who hawked the firearms to gangs
throughout Southern California and the Mexican Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   One of those people is dead.
</P>
<P>
   Another is under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Agents refused to release the names of either suspect and
significant details about the cases. ``But most of the weapons were
going to one guy, Kahir `Tim' Helo,'' Borthwick said.
</P>
<P>
   Kahir Helo _ a 365-pound man with lifelong kidney disease and a
nickel-and-dime criminal past _ routinely rendezvoused with Sycip
in supermarket parking lots across the Valley, purchasing 785 of
the handguns, federal agents said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Makar, investigators have a record of more than 200
calls from the Sun Valley gasoline station where Helo worked to
Sycip's home.
</P>
<P>
   Helo, 27, sold the guns primarily to Glendale gang members; one
of his customers was a bank robber who held up the First Interstate
Bank in Escondido on Jan. 31, 1996, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   After surrendering to authorities in September, Helo pleaded
guilty to one count of dealing firearms without a license and one
count of possession of a firearm with removed or altered serial
numbers, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A medical report submitted to the court in his defense described
Helo as ``morbidly obese,'' ``very fragile'' and ``roly-poly'' in
recent years due to his kidney problems.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Blumenkrantz claimed incarceration ``would result in
severe medical and psychiatric trauma,'' possibly contributing to
the gunrunner's ``demise.''
</P>
<P>
   In a groveling apology letter to a federal judge, Helo sought
mercy, saying his crimes were &UR;  &LR; all just a big mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you would be able to look into my heart for one second you
would see that I don't have the heart of a criminal, but the heart
of someone who made a big mistake and regrets it at every waking
moment,'' Helo wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Confined to a federal prison medical center in Springfield, Mo.,
Helo is serving an 18-month sentence and will be under supervised
probation for two years after his release. He receives daily
dialysis treatments to keep him alive.
</P>
<P>
   While in prison, he is not eligible for a kidney transplant. He
could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say that Helo received a harsh sentence is absurd,'' said
the ATF's Torres. ``I am pleased to say that the system worked in
this case.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Firearms trafficking is an evil crime,'' he said. ``Being the
father of two boys, I take it seriously when a firearms trafficker
illegally dumps these things on the street for the simple motive of
greed.''
</P>
<P>
   Agents continue to search for the remainder of the 1,200 guns.
At the time deputies stopped Gooding and found the guns, nothing
required them to submit them to the ATF for tracing.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and Los
Angeles Police Department didn't start tracing all guns used in
crimes until last year, and two months ago California became only
the second state to pass legislation requiring law enforcement
officials to trace every recovered weapon.
</P>
<P>
   It is becoming a national movement.
</P>
<P>
   Startled by the ATF gun trafficking report, President Clinton
proposed in February to add more money to the federal budget to
enable more cities to perform comprehensive tracing. Currently only
27 cities, including Los Angeles, trace all recovered firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've started submitting more traces to the ATF. It gives us a
better picture of what's happening in terms of where the guns are
coming from. We also have a better idea where they're ending up,''
said Detective Steven Mulldorfer, commander of the LAPD Gun Unit.
</P>
<P>
   The ATF's Torres said modern computer technology has become
``the Achilles' heel of today's gun traffickers,'' and that
Hastings' long shot paid off.

BLACK MARKET ARMS CRIMINALS, GANGSTERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREG GITTRICH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When deputies stopped a Ford Bronco outside a
crowded West Hollywood nightclub, they found TV actor Omar Gooding
behind the wheel and three handguns missing serial numbers on the
seat.
</P>
<P>
   Using new, sophisticated technology, ATF agents painstakingly
identified the guns and traced them back to a cache of more than
1,200 weapons an illegal immigrant bought with a forged gun
dealer's license.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, that led them to a 365-pound Northridge man and two
other illegal dealers who had sold the weapons to San Fernando
Valley gangs, the Mexican Mafia, drive-by shooters, a bank robber _
and Gooding, younger brother of Oscar-winning actor Cuba Gooding
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, authorities have recovered 59 of the 1,200 guns in
what they say is a shocking story of black market gunrunning in Los
Angeles _ a trail of crime facilitated by the ease with which
criminals can get weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very typical of the type of gun trafficking that's
going on right now in Los Angeles,'' said John Torres, assistant
special agent in charge of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms' Los Angeles Field Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guns were being used in crimes in the San Fernando
Valley, Los Angeles and near San Diego literally within a week
after they were purchased illegally. They hit the street extremely
quickly. They were brand new and most of them were not
small-caliber handguns.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a new Los Angeles law that limits buyers to one gun
purchase a month as part of a nationwide push for stronger gun
laws, thousands of these weapons continue to reach criminals and
children, Torres said.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to a long-held presumption, criminals don't need to
steal their guns or buy them across state lines, according to a new
analysis by the ATF, the most comprehensive study of its kind.
Rather, a growing portion of the guns used in crimes taken from
juveniles and felons in Los Angeles are less than three years old
and bought from gun shops but then resold to people who otherwise
couldn't buy them legally.
</P>
<P>
   Like the ones that ended up in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The massive gunrunning ring began unraveling Nov. 25, 1995, at 2
a.m. when sheriff's deputies in the West Hollywood station got an
anonymous telephone call.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a report that these guys in a car on Sunset Boulevard
had at least one gun,'' recalled Deputy Mark Gayman.
</P>
<P>
   Gayman and his partner stopped the Ford Bronco parked outside a
nightclub on the crowded boulevard. The deputy had no idea the
driver was Gooding, a 22-year-old Sherman Oaks actor from TV's
``The Smart Guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When the crowd outside the nightclub saw who we were
arresting, we nearly had a riot on our hands,'' Gayman said. ``They
were throwing bottles and rocks, and yelling the normal stuff at
us. We had to call for backup from LAPD and Beverly Hills. It
wasn't a good situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Bronco were three handguns, all with obliterated
serial numbers.
</P>
<P>
   According to court records, Gooding pleaded no contest to
possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number. He was
fined $500 and placed on probation for 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Gooding and his publicist declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   He also refused to tell deputies where he got the guns, two
Sundance .25-caliber handguns and a late-model Sterling pistol.
Without his help, the chances of tracing the guns taken from
Gooding's car looked bleak because the serial numbers appeared to
be chiseled off, deputies said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Detective Lawrence Hastings forwarded the firearms
to the ATF National Tracing Center in West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   In the following months, federal agents raised the serial
numbers on one of the Sundance models, tracing the gun to J&AMP;J Loan,
a pawn shop on Florence Avenue in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing records from the federal firearm license
assigned to the shop, Torres said, investigators discovered the
handgun was one of 1,200 firearms purchased between May 1995 and
March 1996 by the retailer.
</P>
<P>
   The shop, however, had been closed during that entire period,
Torres said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A former employee, Manuel Sycip, stole the license and
doctored it,'' Torres said. ``The shop's owners had no idea what he
was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   According to court papers, Sycip came to the United States from
the Philippines on a special visa in 1991 to obtain medical
treatment for his daughter. After the visa expired, he illegally
remained in the country and got a job at J&AMP;J Loan.
</P>
<P>
   When the owner died, Sycip started his own gun business, federal
agents said.
</P>
<P>
   ATF Special Agent Thomas Makar led a search of Sycip's Temple
City apartment June 4, 1996. The task force seized 30 firearms, as
well as electric grinding tools found ``on a vise in a bedroom that
had been converted into a firearms and ammunition workshop.''

had 10 applications for every $17,000-plus kindergarten opening for
this coming fall, more than the average for New York's private
schools. And the only public girls' school in New York City has
also been deluged with applications. By Tamar Lewin.

of catching up to do. For three decades the Communist Party branded
recreational sex a bourgeois pastime; prostitution and sexually

<P>
   BEIJING _ There are two sides to the sexual revolution that is
sweeping through China.
</P>
<P>
   At a free afternoon sex education workshop in coastal Ningbo,
24-year-old Zhu Dihui takes diligent notes on condoms and
conception, gearing up to partake of sensual pleasures that were
mostly off-limits to his parents' generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plan to get married in a year or two, and this is important
training,'' said Zhu, who describes himself as ``conservative'' and
who took a day off from his job at a department store to go to the
workshop. ``I need to learn some things: When is the best time to
get pregnant, what kinds of contraceptives are available. Both men
and women should be informed.''
</P>
<P>
   But 750 miles away, at a low brick clinic by a highway in
Beijing, it is clear that China's sexual revolution has brought
more than healthy liberation: each day, a parade of nervous young
men, most with cell phones and leather jackets, shuffle into Dr.
Yang Guanglu's spartan green examination room, each with a story
and a sexually transmitted disease.
</P>
<P>
   In China, rates of sexually transmitted diseases are rising more
than 20 percent a year, helping to fuel a small but growing HIV
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life these days is much more open,'' said a 29-year-old sound
engineer with a ponytail who gave only his surname, Wang. Wang
recently got his first case of gonorrhea after unprotected sex with
a prostitute. ``I guess the key is self-protection, using
condoms,'' he said. ``You have to learn how to look after yourself
now.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to avoid noticing sex in China these days, with sex
shops sprouting up in every city and sex-advice call-in shows on
late-night radio.
</P>
<P>
   Walls in urban areas are decorated with fliers for sexual
clinics (``One Shot and You're Cured!''). Newspaper columns debate
the pros and cons of condom advertising. Viagra _ here called Weige
(or ``big brother'') _ is the most talked about drug in town, even
though it is not yet approved for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``For decades sex was totally unmentionable; people who talked
about it were persecuted and regarded as hooligans,'' said Dr. Ma
Xiaonian, whose Viagra paperweight and bookshelves scattered with
phallic symbols attest to his status as the only board-certified
sexologist in China. ``But in the 80s the subject freed up in fits
and starts. And today, if a magazine doesn't have sex, its sales
will certainly fall.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese have a lot of catching up to do. For three decades
the Communist Party branded recreational sex a bourgeois pastime;
prostitution and sexually transmitted diseases quickly disappeared.
But, with sex taboo and even basic sex education classes abolished,
a whole generation was left ignorant and embarrassed. Their
children today often arrive at adulthood in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Particularly in the small cities and towns, sheer ignorance of
sex is a big, big problem,'' said the doctor, who is a frequent
guest on call-in advice shows. ``There are so many wrong ideas,
even among doctors, that people don't know what to believe.''
</P>
<P>
   To emphasize the point he pulled out an article by a People's
Liberation Army ``expert'' on premature ejaculation, warning that
masturbation will cause impotence after marriage.
</P>
<P>
   This 30-year vacuum in part explains the proliferation of sex
education courses, where young Chinese learn about sex from
scratch, often with the same earnestness that they study computers.
</P>
<P>
   At the Shanghai Metallurgical Institute, 25 college students
recently watched a middle-aged chemistry professor named Xu Ganhe
project anatomical drawings on a screen and discuss the case of a
women who had a needle left in her abdomen during surgery. ``She
couldn't enjoy sex for the next 18 years, so a court gave her
$7,000. Was it worth that much?'' Xu asked, to a smattering of
giggles.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys show that still only about 20 percent of college
students in China have premarital sex. In Xu's class, only one
student, Wang Yirong, had ever discussed sex with his parents; he
initiated the discussion. ``The old generation was restricted by
the revolutionary way of thinking,'' Wang explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk about sex when we're lying in our dorm room at
night,'' said Cai Ruihua, a pretty 20-year-old. ``But our parents
are still very conservative.'' Xu admitted that he had never
discussed sex with his own 23-year-old triplet sons.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a deep conservative streak still runs through China,
especially in some government circles. Local officials and party
newspapers regularly criticize sex talk shows as ``spiritual
pollution'' and some cities have banned condom advertisements from
public places. Government anti-pornography campaigns are still
common _ even though pirated pornographic videos are readily
available.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop, sex in China often has an oddly
antiseptic bent _ not a lusty pleasure but a science to be mastered
for physical and mental health. Sex shop salesmen often wear white
coats, and the shops employ doctors for free consultations.

<P>
   Every morning Qiao Yue, 38, drops his 8-year-old daughter off at
school and goes to work at his new sex shop, referred to as an
``adult health store.'' It is a cache of condoms and pink
rechargeable vibrators, aphrodisiacs and life-like vaginas, all in
the midst of an otherwise nondescript block of restaurants and
small electronics stores.
</P>
<P>
   There are now 2,000 such stores across the country, with well
over $20 million in sales. ``There is a big market for this stuff
now,'' said Qiao, a former factory manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``People used to think that once they had their kid, that was
it, sex was over,'' he said. ``But people's attitudes toward sex
have changed dramatically since opening up. Now people believe that
sex is something that is first good for your health and only last
for reproduction.'' His customers range from 70-year-old professors
to 20-year-old laid-off workers; about two-thirds are men.
</P>
<P>
   The medicalization of sex perhaps explains why the impending
arrival of Viagra has caused such a hubbub, with traditional
medical doctors rushing to patent a home-grown version and usurp
the name. Black market Weige costs more than $40 a pill.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another effect of more liberal attitudes about sex,
one that is most obvious in nightclubs sprinkled with prostitutes
and the clinics treating sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
   There were 461,510 cases of sexually transmitted disease in
China in 1997, almost a hundredfold increase from the 5,838 cases
in 1985. Most experts believe this estimate is low, since many of
the small private clinics do not report cases.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors who were in medical school in the '50s, '60s and '70s
never saw a patient with gonorrhea. But at the Beijing Institute
for Sexually Transmitted Diseases Control and Research, Dr. Yang
Guanglu and his assistants _ who take swabs and administer shots _
now see 40 or 50 people a day.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to syphilis and gonorrhea, Yang has also diagnosed a
few cases of AIDS. Unprotected sex is an increasingly common means
of HIV transmission in a country where fewer than 5 percent of
adults use condoms, a number of surveys have shown.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're fine! That's normal!'' Yang said cheerfully to a young
man whose pants and long johns still hung around his ankles. The
man had recently visited a prostitute and was convinced that he had
caught something.
</P>
<P>
   But most customers leave with another diagnosis. ``I have to
come back for shots for three days?'' asked a young traveling
salesman named Zheng, with syphilis.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to,'' said the doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then how'll I get cured?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't!'' said Yang, an avuncular man in his early 60s.
``Go get the shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Yang does not pass judgment _ and supports the use of
condoms _ he does see his booming business as a sign of moral
laxity.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to become prosperous, we've needed to engage the
outside world, and that has let new ideas and also diseases in,''
he said. ``There are those in China whose moral standards are not
up to snuff, and a small number have sex lives that are very
chaotic.''
</P>
<P>
   China is now beginning to address the epidemic of sexually
transmitted diseases. But it is a difficult task, particularly in
rural areas, where officialdom is often most squeamish about sex
and government family planning offices the sole purveyors of
contraceptives. Traditionally, family planning clinics only cater
to married couples and rely heavily on IUDs, although some are
starting to offer condoms and birth control pills.
</P>
<P>
   In the cities, contraceptives are now widely sold in drugstores
and ``adult health'' shops. Patrons are slowly learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers used to throw money on the table and run out
embarrassed,'' said Qiao, the shop owner. ``Now it's more like
buying clothes. They ask questions. Can they return merchandise? Is
there a warranty? That sort of thing.''

POPULATION CONTROL MEASURES TO AID WOMEN ARE STUMBLING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Egypt, Italy, Bangladesh, Argentina, Nicaragua, Guatemala,
Chile, Libya, Sudan, Algeria and Malta)   By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ A consensus reached at a 180-nation conference
in Cairo, Egypt, five years ago on a new strategy for limiting
world population growth by improving the status of women is now
facing serious religious, ideological and financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   The new strategy would allow the world's population to rise from
its present level of about 5.9 billion people to close to 9.8
billion by the year 2050, and then hold it at around that level.
</P>
<P>
   But a review conference convened here at the end of last month
to see what progress countries were making toward the Cairo goals
broke up with barely half its work completed.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of comparing experiences with the Cairo program, the 180
governments represented spent days wrangling over such sensitive
issues as abortion, contraception, sex education for teen-agers and
women's rights to the frustration of the more than 700 private
organizations interested in population and women's issues attending
the session.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting did not even discuss money for the Cairo program. It
is increasingly unclear whether the world will be able to raise
spending on population policies from $10 billion a year at present
to the $17 billion required under the new strategy in the year
2000, or the nearly $22 billion needed by 2015 at a time when
Western aid to developing nations is falling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are having a replay of the differences which surfaced at
Cairo by some of the countries who feel they lost out then,''
acknowledged Bangladesh's representative, Anwarul Karim Chowdhury,
chairman of the review conference, which will reconvene next month
to complete its work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sorry to see a meeting that was supposed to take stock
of how countries are implementing the Cairo program turn into an
attempt to renegotiate that program,'' said Anika Rahman, of the
Center for Reproductive Law and Policy, one of the private lobbying
groups attending the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a ``huge gap between promises and performance,'' June
Persaud, the Guyanese delegate who spoke for the Group of 77, as
the 130 developing member countries of the United Nations call
themselves, predicted the industrialized world will provide only 33
percent of the $5.7 billion it is supposed to contribute to the
program by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike earlier U.N. efforts to curb population growth, which
emphasized numerical targets, the Cairo strategy assumes women will
automatically limit the size of their families as they become
healthier, richer and more educated and enjoy a higher social
status.
</P>
<P>
   It calls for universal access to reproductive and sexual health
care by 2015 as well as universal access to primary education,
gender equality and sharp reductions in infant, child and maternal
mortality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cairo marks a shift in emphasis in population policy from
targets and numbers to improving women's lives,'' said Rosalind P.
Petchesky, of the International Reproductive Rights Research Action
Group. ``You won't stem population growth without bettering the lot
of women.''
</P>
<P>
   But instead of using last month's review conference to compare
national experiences in carrying out the Cairo program, delegates
found themselves locked in a linguistic struggle over what they
should say about a number of sensitive subjects in the report they
will present to a special session of the U.N. General Assembly in
July.
</P>
<P>
   A loose coalition of conservative Roman Catholic and Muslim
countries, led by the Vatican and including Argentina, Nicaragua,
Guatemala, Chile, Libya, Sudan, Algeria and Malta, sought
continually to water down commitments made at Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   They balked, for instance, at a pledge to ensure abortions are
safe for women legally entitled to them.
</P>
<P>
   They sought to bolster parental authority at the expense of
educating young people about sex and providing them with
independent health care. They opposed any endorsement of so-called
``emergency contraception,'' which destroys a fertilized egg before
it becomes implanted in the uterine wall, making a women clinically
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, this group sought unsuccessfully to block private
pressure groups like the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy
from attending next month's reconvened conference.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ The French writer Andre Malraux once warned a Serbian
visitor of the danger of an ``Algerian war'' in Kosovo. He added,
``And your Algeria will not be on another continent, but in your
heartland.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 years after that prediction was made, it appears to
have come true. The resistance of an overwhelming majority of
ethnic Albanians fiercely opposed to what they see as colonial
Serbian oppression has passed beyond the intermittent rioting of
the 1980s to the war of today.
</P>
<P>
   The Algerian war, a brutal struggle for Algerian independence
from France, brought the fall of the French Fourth Republic.
Whether President Slobodan Milosevic's autocratic Yugoslav regime
can survive the fighting in Kosovo remains a question. But it is
already clear that, having provided the key to his rise to power,
Kosovo has the potential to be Milosevic's nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after driving several hundred thousand Albanians from
their homes, Milosevic reversed course _ at least nominally _ and
made what seemed a curious appeal. He invited Kosovo Albanians to
come back and share ``joint life, peace, unity and understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   The language was strongly reminiscent of the official parlance
of Tito's Yugoslavia, a country always described as a ``socialist
federation of free and equal peoples'' based on ``the brotherhood
and unity'' of its ``nations and nationalities'' and on ``the
struggle for peace in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   This use of the language of Tito's times has been a hallmark for
Milosevic since he rose to power in 1987, becoming the Serbian
leader after a long climb through the ranks of the League of
Communists.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the long and violent break-up of Tito's Yugoslavia, a
country of six republics, two autonomous provinces, at least five
distinct languages and three main religions, Milosevic has sought
to maintain the illusion that the country still existed. This
served to buttress his argument that Serbs merely wanted to remain
in their state while other national groups were causing the
bloodshed by wanting to leave it.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was Milosevic himself who played the leading role in
undoing the delicate mosaic of Tito's Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   With its multiple ethnic and national groups _ 36 percent Serb,
20 percent Croat, 9 percent Bosnian Muslim, 8 percent Albanian, 8
percent Slovene, 6 percent Macedonian, 2.5 percent Montenegrin _
this former Yugoslavia long governed by Tito hinged on elaborate
mechanisms of balance and self-government.
</P>
<P>
   But, opting to fill the vacuum of a crumbling Communist system
with the compelling but treacherous clamor of Serbian nationalism,
Milosevic smashed Tito's delicate equilibrium in the late 1980s.
Kosovo was the principal vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Accusing the ethnic Albanians of ``demographic genocide''
against the minority Kosovo Serbs _ a reference to the Albanians'
high birth rate _ and expressing the grievances of Kosovo Serbs,
who felt they had become aliens on Serbia's most holy land,
Milosevic quashed the autonomy that Tito had accorded Kosovo, and
in 1989 installed his own men to replace the province's
predominantly Albanian leadership.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Milosevic had already moved to secure his power by
mounting similar internal coups to gain control of Serbia's other
autonomous province, Vojvodina, and the republic of Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the eight-member rotating presidency bequeathed by
Tito on Yugoslavia had become one in which Milosevic controlled
four seats _ those of Serbia, Kosovo, Vojvodina and Montenegro. The
Slovenes and Croats, who had long chafed at federal rule from
Belgrade, quickly dubbed Yugoslavia ``Serboslavia'' and wanted out,
just as the Kosovo Albanians do today.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that Milosevic was aware, even a decade ago, that the
process he had set in motion would be violent.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, in 1989, he spoke of a ``humiliated'' Serbian people
that should throw off its ``inferiority complex'' to assume its
place as ``the big nation in this region'' and recover its ``its
state, national and spiritual integrity'' through ``armed battles''
if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Those battles have now unfurled with such persistence and
violence that Milosevic's most recent appeal for ``unity'' and
``joint life'' with the Albanians appears to run counter to a
decade whose overwhelming characteristic has been the separation
and unscrambling of once-mixed Yugoslav ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point,'' said Jonathan Eyal, a British foreign policy
analyst, ``an independent Kosovo, sooner or later, is probably
inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there is not much ``joint life'' left in what was
Yugoslavia. Slovenia was always ethnically homogeneous _ with a
population more than 90 percent Slovene _ and it was therefore able
to extricate itself from Yugoslavia in 1991 with relatively little
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia, whose population was 12 percent Serbian before the wars
of Yugoslavia's destruction began, endured four years of conflict
before it gained independent control of all its territory, a
process that involved the eviction of most Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, after the departure of about 300,000 Serbs, the Serbian
share of the population has fallen to about 5 percent and continues
to dwindle.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnia, the most ethnically mixed of the former Yugoslav
republics, was 43.7 percent Muslim, 31.4 percent Serbian and 17.3
percent Croatian, according to the last Yugoslav census, taken a
year before war erupted there in 1992. It is now governed on the
basis of the de facto division of the country into three largely
ethnically pure regions under Serbian, Muslim and Croatian control.
</P>
<P>
   After the eviction of more than 800,000 Muslims, most of them
driven out in 1992, the Serbian area of Bosnia, covering 49 percent
of the territory, is now 94 percent Serbian.
</P>
<P>
   The Muslim area, covering 32 percent of the territory, is now
more than 90 percent Muslim. The Croatian area, accounting for the
remaining 19 percent of Bosnia, is more than 90 percent Croat.
</P>
<P>
   In all, this unraveling of Tito's Yugoslavia has involved the
deaths of more than 200,000 people and the displacement of more
than 3 million _ including the hundreds of thousands of ethnic
Albanians now driven out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of the Serbian province of Vojvodina, where
an ethnic Hungarian minority lives alongside Serbs, most
coexistence has been obliterated.
</P>
<P>
   Tito was always aware of the fragility of his postwar creation:
``a federal state having the form of a state community of
voluntarily united nations and their socialist republics,'' as he
once described it. He saw government essentially as a balancing act
in which he placed himself at the fulcrum.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has taken over some of the Titoesque trappings _ the
relentless state propaganda dedicated to his person, the official
language of ``unity'' and ``peace'' and ``friendship.'' Kosovo's
Albanians, at least, are likely to pay little heed to such
terminology in their press for independence. Kosovo's place in
Serbia and Yugoslavia, like Algeria's place in France four decades
ago, now appears acutely vulnerable.

COMMENTARY: COWBOY FEMINISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As that wacky Freud gloomily observed, ``My God, what does a
woman want?''
</P>
<P>
   When we were gatherers, we wanted hunters.
</P>
<P>
   Then we wanted clean-cut doctors and lawyers instead of hirsute
alphas in loin cloths.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the '60s. We wanted equal pay for equal work,
co-partners and zipless adventures.
</P>
<P>
   Then we wanted Mr. Moms, male nurturers to share the burden of
food-shopping and baby-diapering (alpha Alan Aldas).
</P>
<P>
   And now that we have feminized society and domesticated our men,
now that we have forced them to help pick Martha Stewart stencils
and watch Olympic ice dancing, guess what we really want.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Yup. Brawny, rippling, rawhide hunks who don't know a Flaubert
from a flambe, or King Lear from King Kong.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboy Option is the perfect coda for a year when feminists
committed hara-kiri to defend their president, and when Hillary
Clinton was unmasked as a counterfeit feminist after she let her
man step all over her.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment scandal dissolved into a rabid demand for the
cherry lip glaze Monica wore during her interview with Barbara
Walters. (There's still a two-week waiting list for it.)
</P>
<P>
   The backlash against feminism offers a rich menu of alternatives
_ from Doris Day to Cosmo nymphet. Drew Barrymore is making a
big-screen version of ``Charlie's Angels.'' Conservative women urge
a return to modesty, while women's magazines pant with seduction
tricks. An April Glamour story interprets the shy, enigmatic
creatures: ``From His Refusal to Talk to His X-Rated Fantasies.''
</P>
<P>
   And now comes Sara Davidson with a new answer to Freud's query.
A journalist who later became a writer and producer for ``Dr.
Quinn, Medicine Woman,'' Ms. Davidson wrote ``Loose Change,'' the
tale of three women navigating the revolutions of the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The '60s changed the world; the way men and women talk, the
way women look at themselves,'' she told The New York Times in
1977. ``Everything is utterly, utterly changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Two decades later, everything is utterly, utterly changed again.
In her new ``fictionalized memoir,'' ``Cowboy: A Love Story,'' Ms.
Davidson asks why a woman can't be more like a man, and choose a
mate based on animal attraction rather than intellectual
compatibility.
</P>
<P>
   The 56-year-old went to do a story on a cowboy poetry and music
festival back in 1993 and met Richard Goff, rawhide braider. Ten
years her junior, he knew how to use his hands. She calls him Zack
in her memoir.
</P>
<P>
   The only impediment to joy for Ms. Davidson was that she and
Goff did not share the same reference points. It's hard to believe
that someone who worked on ``Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman'' could find
someone intellectually and culturally inadequate. But she winced a
bit. He had never heard of Anne Frank, or even William Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   He did, however, have other talents. ``We were two famished
souls and we were having a feeding frenzy,'' she writes, in one of
her tamer passages.
</P>
<P>
   In a Times interview last week with Alex Witchel, Ms. Davidson
struggled with the trade-offs.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes she sounded confident about ``fourth-wave feminism,''
where, she said, all the rules go out the window and women can
choose ``nontraditional'' men.
</P>
<P>
   Other times, she was defensive: ``Can I have a deep relationship
with someone who hasn't read Anne Frank?'' She is wrestling with
her elitism, hoping that literacy is not more important than lust.
</P>
<P>
   I asked my girlfriends what trade-offs they would make.
``Shakespeare and Fitzgerald are requirements,'' said Jill. ``But
I'd sacrifice a few lesser Henry James novels.''
</P>
<P>
   It's tough. What if he knows about Brutus' fatal blunders but
has never heard of ``Coriolanus''? Does he have to have experienced
the Norton Shakespeare, or will the Miramax version do?
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboy Option is already giving men I know the jitters. They
are annoyed that just when we've trained them to be more like us,
we decide to be more like them. Just when we've impressed upon them
the shame of liking dumb, sexy girls, we pounce on dumb, sexy guys.
</P>
<P>
   What does a woman want?
</P>
<P>
   Rodeo and Juliet.

COMMENTARY: SENIOR CITIZENS ON THE BREAD LINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz.)   (bl)  
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. _ Getting enough to eat has sometimes been a
problem for Dolores Heuser. She lost an arm to cancer and her
savings are gone. While much of America was experiencing an
economic boom, she was making a demoralizing move from her
comfortable home in the Phoenix suburb of Youngtown to a low-income
residence in nearby El Mirage. Having reached her 70s (``I won't
tell you exactly how old I am,'' she said), Ms. Heuser, a widow,
frequently found herself without money for food.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in a very bad situation,'' she said. ``I only had Social
Security coming in, and I couldn't get by on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunger is an awful, debilitating companion. You can test this by
missing a few meals. Ms. Heuser learned, like many thousands of
other elderly citizens, that after her essential monthly expenses
were paid, the money she would have spent on food had mostly
vanished. She was helped through her crisis by donations of food
distributed by the Second Harvest food-bank network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without that, I don't know what I would have done,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Scenes of poverty-stricken Americans standing in bread lines are
standard in documentaries about the Depression, which ended more
than half a century ago. What is not generally acknowledged _
perhaps not widely known _ is that there are bread lines all over
the United States right now.
</P>
<P>
   Early Thursday morning older residents of El Mirage began lining
up at a senior citizens center for donations of food provided by
the West Side Food Bank in the neighboring town of Surprise. They
did not discuss their portfolios or the surging Nasdaq. The
heralded free-market economy had left them far behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, this helps, you know,'' said Carol Lorig, 80. ``I have
to take care of my son, who's ill and can't work. We don't have
enough money.''
</P>
<P>
   William Yakubik, 86, said: ``You cut down the food if you have
to. Eat less. The cost of living, you know how it is. Robbing Peter
to pay Paul. Feast or famine.''
</P>
<P>
   Debbi Ennis, one of the directors of the food bank, said the
elderly residents who line up for food supplies are especially
vulnerable to unexpected expenses. ``These are people who cannot
afford food if they experience an illness and have to buy medicine,
or if their car breaks down and has to be repaired, or if there is
some kind of unexpected housing expense, like a leaking roof or a
break-in. Then they are in serious trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   A study a few years ago by the Urban Institute, a research
organization in Washington, found that nearly 2 million elderly
Americans had faced at least one of two terrible dilemmas: whether
to pay their rent or buy food, or whether to pay for medicine or
buy food. Those are choices no American should have to make.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the nation's population as a whole, Doug O'Brien,
the director of public policy and research at Second Harvest, said:
``We are finding a great deal of pain and anxiety and some
instances of malnutrition. Hunger is disguised in this country.
It's not like it is in North Korea, where people have to eat grass,
or in East Africa, where they just waste away. It's not
life-threatening in most cases. But it is a serious, insidious
problem that affects many million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a hunger problem. And other Western industrialized
nations do not have a hunger problem. And that is just not
acceptable when we have such abundance.''
</P>
<P>
   Second Harvest is the largest nonprofit clearinghouse in the
United States for donations to soup kitchens and food pantries.
Officials said a recent comprehensive survey showed that over the
course of a year, more than 21 million people sought emergency food
assistance through the Second Harvest network. The officials
stressed that the 21 million figure referred to separate
individuals, not the total number of emergency meals served. And
they said they believed that there were many more Americans,
millions more, who did not have enough money to pay for an adequate
diet.
</P>
<P>
   Dolores Heuser, whose situation is typical, is resigned to her
new circumstances. ``I can't go to a lovely restaurant,'' she said.
``I can't get my hair set anymore. But I am thankful for the
assistance. I'll go on Monday for a food box.''

have puzzled over what could have brought down one of the world's

with the pilot, a review of technical clues and an analysis of how
the Serbian air defenses have been operating, a secret Air Force
inquiry now believes a combination of tactics, quick learning and

on the killers, officials did not write a law that simply moves
children into the adult justice system. Instead, state leaders
brought in child development specialists, consulted with both
prosecutors and defense lawyers, and came up with a far more
tempered bill than anyone had expected. By David Firestone.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ira J. Feldman finished filling his Mazda with
gasoline, eyed the readout on the pump and raised his hands, arms
wide, as if to say, ``You've got to be kidding.'' At $1.59 a
gallon, he had just paid $21.56 for 13 gallons of gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a joke,'' Feldman, a 51-year-old home restorer, said.
``What's the excuse? They're telling us there's a war? The chairman
of the board had a bad meal last night? I don't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although gasoline prices around the country have increased over
the past several months, in part because of announced cuts in
worldwide oil production, prices in California have soared the
most, with the sharpest increases in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The average price for a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline in
California this week was $1.58, up from $1.11 in late February,
when fires and production problems at refineries in the state,
coupled with the overall increase in crude prices, began to drive
up the price. Nationwide, the average is about $1.10.
</P>
<P>
   California, with 25 million registered vehicles, sprawling
cities and suburbs and a lattice of eight-lane highways, consumes a
million barrels of gasoline a day. For most of the state's 33
million people, it is a staple, like bread or eggs or milk.
</P>
<P>
   The high prices leave some drivers wavering between anger and
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, they're astronomical, Jonni Mae, 46, a business owner,
said of prices after paying $9 for five gallons of super-unleaded
gas. ``I have to spend the money. But I hate to spend the money.''
</P>
<P>
   A fire at a Tosco refinery in the San Francisco Bay area on Feb.
22 and another at a nearby Chevron refinery one month later are
blamed for onset of the price increase. The fires, along with other
distribution problems, caused a 15 percent drop in production,
driving up prices.
</P>
<P>
   California's government mandates use of a less polluting
oxygenated blend that is rarely produced elsewhere, making it
difficult to import gasoline during shortages.
</P>
<P>
   The 15 percent drop in production, which has since been more
than corrected, has led to a 30 percent retail price increase on
regular unleaded. As a result, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., asked
the Federal Trade Commission in a March 31 letter to take action to
ensure fair competition and keep prices down. A Los Angeles
councilwoman, Laura Chick, has asked the city to look into the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   John Lichtblau, an analyst for the Petroleum Industry Research
Foundation, which is financed by the industry, said gasoline
companies were not taking advantage of events.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way the market works,'' Lichtblau said. ``When
production is down, prices can temporarily increase
disproportionately. Basically, what you have is an unusual shutdown
of normal refinery operations in one single market.''
</P>
<P>
   But drivers remain suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think somebody just wants more money in their pocket,'' said
Robert Arias, a 39-year-old construction worker from Victorville.
``I mean, people are going to have to buy it no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   Arias was filling his pickup, which gets 16 miles to the gallon,
for the second time Saturday. ``Don't have much of a choice,'' he
said. ``It's either pay it, or stay home.''

NATO FINDS KOSOVO WAR IS A FLY IN ITS CHAMPAGNE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By TIM WEINER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In two weeks, the largest summit meeting in
American history is happening here. Presidents, prime ministers,
soldiers and statesmen from 42 nations will gather to honor the
50th anniversary of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   But the guests in white tie may still be making war in the
Balkans, casting a shroud over what was to have been a celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Images of shattered towns and burning buildings will be fresh in
the world's mind as the champagne glasses clink at the White House,
toasts are exchanged, and President Clinton proclaims a new
``strategic concept'' for NATO. The Kosovo Albanians will be ``the
uninvited guests at the summit,'' said Richard Haass, director of
the Brookings Institution, and the specter of hungry and homeless
refugees could haunt the glittering state dinners.
</P>
<P>
   Preparations are proceeding apace. Predicting that limousines
ferrying 1,700 foreign leaders and their entourages will choke the
streets, the government has told 90,000 federal workers to stay
home, the better to speed the Lincolns and Cadillacs from gala to
gala. But no one can stop an apparently imminent collision of pomp
and war.
</P>
<P>
   Some American officials saw this excruciatingly awkward moment
coming. ``Come late April, we could be debating the fine points of
a new strategic concept while Europe faces a new humanitarian
disaster, a new flood of refugees, and the fourth Balkan war of
this century,'' Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott told an
international security conference in London last month.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that if war came to Kosovo, it would ``cast a pall,
not only over the Washington summit,'' but over world leaders'
hopes ``to fulfill the objectives they will set for themselves at
the summit.''
</P>
<P>
   The pall is cast. The summit meeting now looks like ``an
unpleasant and inauspicious 50th anniversary,'' said Charles
Kupchan, a former senior European affairs officer on the National
Security Council. ``What was supposed to be a celebratory,
self-congratulatory feast may look more like a wake, and people
have to stare that in the face.''
</P>
<P>
   Kupchan, now a professor at Georgetown University, continued:
``These things are supposed to be scripted well in advance, but no
one knows what the facts on the ground will be two weeks from now.
There's a huge amount riding on the summit with the backdrop of an
ongoing slaughter. I can't image how NATO leaders are going to make
this look like a success.''
</P>
<P>
   Against this gloomy backdrop, administration officials say they
will have to ``adjust the tone'' of the gathering. For example, a
fly-by of NATO fighter jets in formation may be canceled as being
in poor taste. But they are determined that the two state dinners,
the two formal lunches and the rest of the diplomatic show will go
on for NATO's 19 member nations and most of the members of the
post-Cold War Partnership for Peace. Russia now looks like it will
boycott the summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The man at the National Security Council coordinating the show _
which Clinton administration officials are now calling a
commemoration, not a celebration _ is Don Bandler, a career Foreign
Service officer and a counselor to National Security Adviser Sandy
Berger.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few people have said, `Why don't you cancel this?''' Bandler
said. ``We don't think that makes any sense.'' He vowed that the
summit meeting would be ``serious and sober,'' not
``triumphalist.''
</P>
<P>
   Triumph is the least likely atmosphere for the gathering, said
Ivo Daalder, who left the National Security Council in 1997, where
he had been senior staff member in charge of European issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that NATO's first major engagement turns out to be a
failure,'' he said. ``And that forces you to ask: What is NATO for?
What good is NATO if it can't deal with a tin-pot dictator in the
middle of Europe?''
</P>
<P>
   American diplomats and White House officials know that the
future of NATO depends on the outcome in Kosovo. The new
``strategic concept'' that will be put forth at the summit meeting
by Clinton is supposed to supplant a doctrine that has not been
updated since 1991, before the enemy that NATO was created to
defeat in war, the Soviet Union, folded its tent.
</P>
<P>
   This new concept calls for NATO to fight outside its members'
borders to defend their interests _ in places like the Middle East
or South Asia. This global ambition is now being tested daily in
battle in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our publics and our parliaments will evaluate the Washington
summit's decisions about NATO's role in managing future crises on
the basis of how well we manage this one,'' said Sandy Vershbow,
the U.S. representative on the North Atlantic Council, the
political arm of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   While no one knows how the war might end, or when, it is now
clear that ``if this mission fails, NATO fails,'' said Daalder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new NATO that was emerging and would have been codified at
the summit now confronts in practice what it was supposed to
confront in theory,'' he said. ``Its new mission is to insure
security outside its borders. Having defined that mission as
fundamental, it is now losing this war and calling into question
its own existence.''

allowed to cross the border overnight said Saturday, its landscape
empty of ethnic Albanians and swarming with Serb troops on the
move. ``It's a desert, what we have seen,'' said Jakup Slamnku, 41,
one of about 1,500 refugees. By John Kifner.

   NY-GIRLS-SCHOOLS (New York) _ Arlene Gibson, the headmistress at
Spence, remembers the bad old days, the early '90s, when girls'
schools had to convince parents of the benefits of single-sex
education. Now, most of Manhattan's seven private girls' schools
had 10 applications for every $17,000-plus kindergarten opening for
this coming fall, more than the average for New York's private
schools. And the only public girls' school in New York City has
also been deluged with applications. By Tamar Lewin.

   EXCLUSIVE-DOWNED-F117 (Washington) _ Ever since a U.S. Air Force
F-117 was downed over Yugoslavia on March 27, Pentagon officials
have puzzled over what could have brought down one of the world's
stealthiest warplanes. Two weeks later, after extensive interviews
with the pilot, a review of technical clues and an analysis of how
the Serbian air defenses have been operating, a secret Air Force
inquiry now believes a combination of tactics, quick learning and
luck came together in one brilliant moment to shoot down the
premier attack jet in America's arsenal. ``We think whoever did
this won the lotto that night,'' said one senior American officer.

on the killers, officials did not write a law that simply moves
children into the adult justice system. Instead, state leaders
brought in child development specialists, consulted with both
prosecutors and defense lawyers, and came up with a far more
tempered bill than anyone had expected. By David Firestone.

YUGOSLAVIAN OFFICIAL TELLS OF PEACE TALKS AND DEATHS

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Serious talks are under way to create an
interim government for Kosovo, a senior Yugoslav official said
Saturday. He also said that more than 300 civilians died and nearly
3,000 more were wounded in the NATO bombings.
</P>
<P>
   These are the most concrete figures for civilian casualties to
emerge since the airstrikes began, although they cannot be
independently confirmed. There has been virtually no information
about Yugoslav military casualties, which are considered a state
secret in wartime.
</P>
<P>
   The official also said that the moderate ethnic Albanian leader,
Ibrahim Rugova, is continuing talks with top Yugoslav officials on
an interim political solution, meeting again on Friday in Pristina
with two deputy prime ministers, Nikola Sainovic and Ratko
Markovic.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Nebojsa Vujovic, was the top-ranking Yugoslav
diplomat in Washington, and lived there for nine years, before the
war began and Belgrade broke relations with the United States and
several other NATO countries. He has just been appointed spokesman
for the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Despite ``NATO propaganda and lies'' that Rugova is being held
against his will and forced into discussions, Vujovic said, ``Dr.
Rugova is not a hostage _ he's a free man who feels the heartbeat
of his people.
</P>
<P>
   ``His talks with us pull the rug out from under the
aggressors,'' Vujovic said, referring to NATO. President Clinton
and other NATO leaders say the bombing will go on until the Serbs
agree to provide Kosovo with a full measure of autonomy under the
protection of an international security force. Before the bombing
began, Belgrade had rejected the idea of 30,000 NATO-led forces
policing a Western-drafted plan in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The talks concern ``an interim government with joint
institutions of self-government representing all ethnic groups and
covering all branches of the local Serbian government,'' including
the police, Vujovic said.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of an interim government with representation by
Serbs and Albanians has been agreed upon, based on a framework for
autonomy, he said, without adding details.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the framework was not specifically based on ``the
Rambouillet process,'' referring to negotiations in France earlier
this year that produced a Western draft plan for far-reaching
Kosovar autonomy. The plan was accepted by the ethnic Albanian
delegation, including Rugova, but rejected by the Serbian
delegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rambouillet was just a grand masquerade, not a real process of
negotiation,'' Vujovic said. ``Dr. Rugova was there but was just
pushed aside, even though he had been earlier received at the White
House and the State Department at the highest level, and the French
gave him a medal. But the U.S. found a new alliance with the Kosovo
Liberation Army, and Rugova's aware of that, and aware of what that
situation has brought the ordinary Albanians of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if this correspondent could interview Rugova, Vujovic
said, ``That time may come,'' but insisted that Yugoslavian
authorities had concerns for Rugova's safety. He said that there
were ideas being floated that Rugova might travel to Moscow to show
that he was acting freely. He also said that Italy and the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe had both asked
for him to visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's most needed here to participate in the process right
now,'' Vujovic said.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign ministry officials regularly deny NATO allegations that
Serbian forces are committing atrocities in Kosovo. They say that
the Kosovo Liberation Army has been fighting a war against the
Serbs and that it is difficult to separate the rebels from the
civilians who support them. They have rejected accusations of mass
killings as well as the existence of an organized policy of
``ethnic cleansing,'' attributing the flight of Kosovo citizens to
fear of NATO bombings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Asked about an article in Saturday's New York Times quoting U.S.
officials saying that up to 700,000 ethnic Albanians are displaced
inside Kosovo and running out of food, Vujovic said the numbers are
``grossly exaggerated.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the bombings began, he said, ``I can guarantee you, there
were not 700,000 displaced people there.'' Vujovic went on to ask:
``Who makes the humanitarian catastrophe NATO says it is bombing to
prevent? The bombs themselves or Serbs chasing the people? Kosovo
has had the greatest bombings, and who would sit in their houses
when the bombs are flying?''
</P>
<P>
   He complained that when the Yugoslavian authorities ask the
ethnic Albanians to remain in Kosovo, they are accused of
endangering them. ``If they go, we are to blame. If they stay, we
are also to blame. It's a no-win for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Vujovic noted with satisfaction that NATO had finally admitted
that one of its bombs had hit a residential part of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many other mistakes have they made that they have not
admitted?'' he asked. He said that 12 civilians had died from a
bomb that landed in the center of the town of Cuprija on Thursday
night, leaving 400 families homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Another 124 people were wounded _ with 23 still in the hospital,
six in intensive care _ when the Zastava automobile and munitions
factory was bombed in Kragujevac, said Milan Beko, the manager of
the factory, interviewed there on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the wounded, visited in the local hospital, were
suffering blast and pressure wounds, with large hematomas and
internal injuries, said Dr. Slavica Djukic-Dejanovic, the head of
the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A ``human shield'' of workers was used to protect the factory,
which is why the night attack hurt so many.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters were not allowed to see the munitions part of the
factory.
</P>
<P>
   Such attacks only stiffen Serbian patriotism and resistance,
Vujovic said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will defend ourselves, with help or without it,'' he said.
``We have no other choice. We're really in a corner, like a cat,
and our nails are out. We've got nowhere to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Told that some Yugoslavians express concerns about how long the
bombing will go on and what long-term damage it will do, Vujovic
said: ``This psychological nervousness will pass and be replaced
with anger, and this anger will grow. Each day, we're like a
porcupine rolling itself more and more tightly into a ball, with
our quills out.''

   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ With NATO bombing of Yugoslavia now in its
18th day, a senior allied diplomat said here Saturday that the
alliance was prepared to continue air attacks ``for many more
weeks'' but that the idea of using ground troops was not being
seriously discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's agreement in the alliance that the air campaign is
having its effect, but that there's a lot more time left before it
has run its course,'' the official said. ``The issue of ground
troops is not being debated in a formal or serious way within the
alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other NATO foreign
ministers will meet here Monday, the alliance's spokesman, Jamie
Shea, said Saturday, to reaffirm the alliance's determination to
continue the air campaign with undiminished intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Albright will go to Oslo, Norway, on Tuesday to talk with the
Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, about the possibility of
bringing Russia back into the search for a lasting peace settlement
in Kosovo, officials said, despite its firm opposition to the
allied bombing campaign and its sharp warnings to the alliance not
to try to go into Kosovo with ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook also had a 45-minute
telephone call with Ivanov on Saturday morning, and Doug Henderson,
the British armed forces minister, said in London on Saturday that
Ivanov had reaffirmed Russia's desire to stay out of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin indicated on Friday that Russia might
respond if the allies decided to fight their way into Kosovo on the
ground. Politically, that is still a forbidden topic for the
allies, and the foreign ministers are not planning to decide on
Monday to change that, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The air campaign will continue, the allies insist, until
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic calls off Serbian military
and police operations that have driven most of the 1.8 million
ethnic Albanians from their homes in Kosovo, and agrees to let
international peacekeepers in to enforce a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said that ``in the next few days'' NATO would be conducting
125 flights to ferry in some two dozen U.S. Apache helicopters and
their accompanying missiles and equipment. Although in Washington
officials said the helicopters' arrival could take a month,
officials here said Saturday that they may be ready for combat
sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials here said that Serbian army and heavily armed
police units have continued attacks against the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army units near Malisevo and farther north near
Mitrovica, despite Milosevic's declaration of a unilateral
cease-fire early last week.
</P>
<P>
   NATO released an aerial photograph of the village of Prilea, an
Albanian settlement two miles from Decani in Kosovo, that showed
almost total destruction of its two-story concrete block homes.
NATO had not bombed the village at all, a military spokesman said,
and all the damage had been done deliberately by the Serbian forces
who drove the original inhabitants away. NATO says 200 villages and
towns have been destroyed by the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian border guards on Friday night also reopened crossings
from Kosovo after three days, and ethnic Albanian refugees began
lining up to get into Macedonia and Albania again Saturday,
according to officials in the field and at NATO headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters at Blace on the Macedonian border saw at least 200
ethnic Albanians moving into the neutral zone between Yugoslav and
Macedonian territory early Saturday and being checked by Macedonian
border guards, the Reuters news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, another group of 1,500 bedraggled Kosovo refugees
sheltered by plastic sheeting crossed into the northern Albanian
village of Morini, saying Serbs had chased them from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The allies also published a map indicating three large areas
inside Kosovo where they believe more than 200,000 people have been
forced to seek shelter in the rubble of their ruined villages or in
the fields and hills of the countryside. The map showed 70,000
people possibly scattered in a broad area east of Malisevo, 60,000
west of Pristina, and another 80,000 to 100,000 west of Podujevo
north of Pristina, the provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they were trying to figure out if they could
effectively drop food and emergency supplies to them from the air.
But the officials indicated that they were skeptical of the idea
unless the few aid agencies allowed to operate in Kosovo could
help.
</P>
<P>
   Low clouds and rain over target areas throughout Yugoslavia on
Friday night and Saturday significantly hindered the air campaign
against the Serbian forces. Those carrying out the attacks in
Kosovo have now largely dug in and taken cover in wrecked villages
or off the main roads, according to Col. Konrad Freytag, an allied
military spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the few air-dropped guided bomb attacks that did take
place destroyed a microwave relay tower near Pristina, and knocked
Serbian state-controlled television off the air there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a relay which has a dual use capability, and was mainly
used by the military,'' Freytag said.
</P>
<P>
   Allied civilian authorities have so far denied the alliance's
top military commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, the authority he
requested to blast Serbian television towers and eliminate what he
believes to be insidious anti-NATO propaganda from the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, according to senior officials here, the allies
are all still agreed that a sustained bombing campaign alone can
force Milosevic to accept a settlement and allow international
peacekeepers in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people knew it could be a long campaign,'' one senior
diplomat said. ``They are pretty realistic about the fact that this
will probably go on for many more weeks. As we get closer to the
goal, I think his attitude will begin to shift.''
</P>
<P>
   The allies say they have destroyed half of Yugoslavia's fuel
supplies, half of its most sophisticated military interceptors, and
two out of the three main army headquarters that did the planning
for the Serbian campaign in Kosovo.

 BRUSSELS, Belgium: in Kosovo.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Milosevic's plan to redraw the ethnic map of the province to
drive out most of the people of Albanian ancestry who lived there
was put in place last October, according to German Defense Ministry
officials.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, code-named ``horseshoe'' or ``potkova'' in the Serbian
language, was launched last October, even as Milosevic was
promising to withdraw the police and military forces that had
already begun driving Albanians out of their homes, German Defense
Minister Rudolf Scharping said in Bonn last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our analysis of `operation horseshoe' sadly confirms what we
had inferred during the negotiations, which is that Milosevic
wanted to win time to prepare a systematic deportation,'' Scharping
said.
</P>
<P>
   Already under threat of NATO bombing last fall, Milosevic agreed
in October talks with Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. special envoy to
the Balkans, to withdraw the attacking Serbian forces. But he would
not accept an international peacekeeping force, so Holbrooke
settled for 2,500 unarmed observers from the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   These observers were never able to stop continued fighting or to
compel Serbian forces to conform to Milosevic's promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``The operation began in November of 1998 in Kosovo,'' Scharping
said. ``It shows that in a certain part of Kosovo the Yugoslav army
and police planned and then began, between November of 1998 and the
beginning of the negotiations in Rambouillet, to expel people.''
</P>
<P>
   German diplomats said that NATO intelligence had observed the
military buildup north of Kosovo and inside the province, but had
wrongly concluded that it was aimed only at the Kosovo Liberation
Army, which has been fighting for independence but last month
accepted proposals for autonomy under Serbian rule, with a NATO
peacekeeping force to guarantee it, in the peace plan worked out in
talks at Rambouillet castle near Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's refusal to accept that plan or even discuss an
international peacekeeping plan was what sparked NATO bombing on
March 24.
</P>
<P>
   The only ground forces the allies planned for are 28,000
peacekeepers in case Milosevic accepts a settlement in Kosovo.
Diplomats here say that if the allies do decide to send in a ground
force, they could do so quickly, since allied military planners
last fall did some contingency planning.

STUDENT INSULARITY MUTES THEIR OUTRAGE TO BALKAN CONFLICT

 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. _ The students at Rutgers University lined
up to stuff their book bags with maps, time lines and other
handouts about the crisis in Kosovo, then elbowed their way into a
``teach-in'' that amounted to a crash course on the hundreds of
years of Balkan conflict that preceded NATO's bombing of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers had set up seats for 80 students but wound up drawing
more than 400. Some tapped notes into their Palm Pilots; most
stayed through all four hours of lectures on Tuesday by experts on
the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Light, 20, a junior majoring in history, came out
convinced that the human rights atrocities justified intervention.
``I'm not a violent person, but the way those people are being
attacked over there _ give me a gun,'' he said. ``If my
grandparents had NATO to protect them from the Nazis, I would have
an aunt. She wouldn't have died at Treblinka.''
</P>
<P>
   Light's outburst testified to a fascination with the Kosovo
conflict that has touched several of the nation's college campuses,
as this apolitical, post-Cold War generation tuned in to foreign
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   A college freshman this year was probably in fourth grade when
the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, in fifth grade when the Persian Gulf
War was fought in early 1991. So for today's students, war is as
antiseptic and theoretical as a computer game. There is none of the
passion that inflamed a Rutgers teach-in on Vietnam in 1965 _ when
a rock sailed through a lecture hall's window _ but then there is
no draft, and no body bags, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a formative experience,'' said James
Miller, a political science professor on the graduate faculty of
the New School University who has studied social protests. ``This
is a generation that is serious-minded and is going to ask
pragmatic and practical questions. Campuses remain places where in
a moment of crisis, young people will take the time to think
through what is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   What students say have shaken them about Kosovo are television
pictures of American soldiers held captive, comparisons to World
War II and the Holocaust, and fear that a military quagmire lies
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Rallies, food drives and speak-outs are being thrown together by
students who say they feel a moral responsibility to respond, but
have only a murky idea of what is happening. Like many adults, they
are not sure what to think, let alone what to do. So the new
activism seems heartfelt, but tentative. The flier for a
candlelight vigil at Elon College in North Carolina, for instance,
proclaims, ``The war in Kosovo demands our attention,'' but planned
action consists of a moment of silence ``for the people who are
suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People are, like, `Whoa! This is something really
important,''' said Vanessa Marvin, 20, a junior at Yale University.
However, Ms. Marvin said she was uncertain what course the United
States should follow, because she did not know the alternatives.
All she can be sure of, she said, is, ``I'm very against
genocide.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Charles Young, a Rutgers doctoral student in history, showed up
at the teach-in in his red ``People's Bookstore'' T-shirt, an
artifact of his days in Madison, Wis., a bastion of student
protests in the 1960s. Young, now 39, was 13 when the draft ended
in 1973. He calls himself a pacifist, but said he is stumped by
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``For once, imperialism is backing the victims,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Chapman University in Orange, Calif., political science
students decided to help the local American Red Cross chapter with
a phone bank for refugee aid. Two University of Kentucky students
have started a relief drive. At the University of Vermont, art
students turned a collage assignment into a gallery of martial
images, including a tank made of plumbing parts, with people formed
from knives, forks and spoons emerging from the gun barrel.
</P>
<P>
   More cuttingly, Virginia Commonwealth University students
greeted visitors at the edge of their Richmond campus on Easter
with signs like, ``No Bomb Is Smart.'' At Rutgers, stenciled black
spray paint began appearing on sidewalks around the campus,
condemning NATO as the ``Nazi American Terrorist Organization.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little new, of course, in students reacting with moral
outrage. ``Whatever else has changed, students are primed to
respond morally, even if an issue is remote from them,'' said
Richard Flacks, a sociology professor at the University of
California at Santa Barbara who has studied demonstrations for 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   Flacks said students' response to this crisis was likely to be
muted by their general disengagement from international affairs.
``To a lot of students, the whole world looks like Bosnia _ a
confusing, undecodable, highly messy set of happenings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even after sitting through the Rutgers teach-in, Justin Main,
21, a junior who had a sketch pad tucked under his arm, still
grasped for basics. ``This Milosevic guy is Serbian, right?'' Main
asked.
</P>
<P>
   After a debate on Wednesday at Columbia University's School of
International and Public Affairs, students left with raging
ambivalence. ``You feel so disheartened by the whole thing,'' said
Rebecca Zimmerman, a sophomore majoring in political science.
``There doesn't seem to be any right answer.''
</P>
<P>
   The degree to which war is largely an intellectual exercise for
today's students was reflected in a chat on the way out of the
Rutgers teach-in. Hidekel Elivo, a freshman majoring in finance,
was saying the United States should back up its air power with
ground troops _ an idea that horrified Anna Tello, a sophomore
majoring in political science.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would send Americans to get killed?'' she asked
incredulously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to get killed,'' Elivo said. ``To help out.''

 &HT;    Off-limits? Some say Congress should leave IOC alone
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Just as the bruises have begun to fade, the battered
International Olympic Committee is about to take another hit: U.S.
politicians are waiting in the halls of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the lords of the rings convened an emergency session
in the security of their marble-clad compound on the shores of Lake
Geneva for a little blood-letting and wound-licking _ and a promise
to press ahead with an ethical cleansing to purge its past of
secrecy and self-dealing.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), not one to shy away from
cameras or controversy, wasn't impressed.
</P>
<P>
   Tough bills in works
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a possible Republican presidential candidate who is
convening his own IOC reform session Wednesday before the Senate
Commerce Committee, said the IOC effort fell far short of what was
needed ``to bring transparency and accountability to the
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain plans tough legislation to strip the IOC of its
tax-exempt status. And he hopes that hitting the international
organization where it hurts _ in its fat bank account will push the
IOC to take more action.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's view is that the IOC merely sacrificed a half-dozen
small fry, set up a couple of commissions chaired by its own
leader, Juan Antonio Samaranch, and washed its hands of the whole
unpleasantness. However, the senator was pleased that two big
names, Henry Kissinger and Peter Ueberroth, agreed last week to
serve on the IOC 2000 reform panel.
</P>
<P>
   McCain thinks Samaranch hasn't taken any of it seriously. Last
month, he closed the IOC meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland, by
proclaiming: ``We promised to clean house. We did it. We promised
reforms. We did it.''
</P>
<P>
   The 78-year-old Spaniard declined McCain's invitation to go
before the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation to
discuss the culture that corrupted Salt Lake City _ and presumably
other cities bidding to host the Olympics. That refusal prompted
McCain to fire off a statement suggesting that Samaranch did not
``understand the gravity of the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the IOC didn't even appear to notice the scandal until
nervous sponsors started withholding payments and calling Lausanne
last winter.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics is a $1 billion-a-year enterprise, and much of that
money comes from corporations seeking to link their products with
the idealized image of the Games. If that image is tainted, it
isn't worth as much to the Coca-Colas and Kodaks that pay $50
million for sponsor rights every four years.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's committee will hear proposed legislation from Sen. Ted
Stevens (R-Alaska) to limit tax deductions that U.S. companies can
take from their sponsorship fees and advertising expenses. For
those companies that claim the deductions, sponsoring the Games
suddenly becomes a far more costly proposition.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also would limit the IOC's access to billions of
dollars in fees for television rights by giving negotiating power
to the U.S. Olympic Committee, which already receives more Olympic
revenue than any other national Olympic committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``If more money were to come in to the U.S. and less would go to
other countries, that would cause some real anxiety and pain among
the other countries of the world and the IOC,'' said Bob Heussner
of Advantage International, Olympic marketing consultants based in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic scholar John J. MacAloon went even further. ``The USOC
does not own the property,'' MacAloon said. ``This is the pirates
emptying the safe while the ship is on rocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the world's premier Olympic scholars join the IOC in
opposing the U.S. government's intervention. The Olympics, they
say, operates outside of global politics, boycotts notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain is astute,'' said historian John Lucas of Penn State,
``but what he knows about the inner machinations of the Olympic
movement can be written on the back of a 33-cent postage stamp. It
would be presumptuous of me to go down to Washington and tell the
Finance Committee how to spend their money.''
</P>
<P>
   The historian thinks Congress has no credibility when it
scrutinizes a private, foreign organization but doesn't appear
interested in examining the United States' own Olympic committee,
the USOC, an organization over which it has jurisdiction under the
Olympic and Amateur Sports Act.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas, who has studied the Olympics for 45 years, acknowledges
that the IOC is in desperate need of reform. But he said, ``McCain
should have absolutely nothing to do directly or indirectly with an
organization that is European-based, international in nature and
mandated by the Swiss government as a nonprofit organization.''
</P>
<P>
   USOC backers to appear
</P>
<P>
   The USOC refuses to release the results of its own internal
investigation into what gifts its members received from bid cities.
It also will not divulge what actions it has taken against any
employees or board members, despite evidence that some probably
knew about Salt Lake City's million-dollar bribery campaign.
</P>
<P>
   MacAloon, a professor of anthropology at the University of
Chicago, said he thinks the USOC is setting the agenda for McCain's
hearings and will emerge unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled to speak are USOC President William Hybl and members
of a USOC-appointed investigation commission headed by former
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine. The commission's
report, issued last month, criticized the IOC for lacking openness
and creating a culture of gift giving that is ``potentially illegal
and inevitably corrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   If the hearings discuss the USOC's role in the scandal, MacAloon
said, ``Then it will be doing good service to the reform of the
Olympic movement. But if, instead, it holds hands with the USOC in
joyful IOC bashing, it will be a huge embarrassment.''
</P>
<P>
   Anita DeFrantz, an IOC member from Los Angeles, will represent
Samaranch. ``It is important for the IOC to be there and have it's
story come out,'' IOC Vice President Dick Pound said. ``And it's
better to have that come out of the mouth of a U.S. citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound, a Canadian who headed the IOC's internal investigation,
said he thinks that McCain's hearing are too late. ``I think it was
a hot issue in February before the IOC began to look at the whole
issue of restructuring,'' Pound said. `` A good deal of what they
seem to be looking for, we've already done.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said sponsors should be upset about congressional
interference.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were a Coca-Cola or Kodak or Xerox,'' Pound said, ``I
would wonder what Congress is proposing to do by monkeying with the
Internal Revenue Code, simply because there is some concern about
where a business expenditure is being directed. I would think that
kind of action would horrify the business community at large.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if McCain's hearing doesn't push the reform legislation
forward, the Olympics has more headaches to come.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Justice Department is expected to complete in June its
criminal investigation into Salt Lake City's bid tactics. Still
under investigation are questions about the commingling of personal
funds with Salt Lake bid committee accounts, the trail of money
from Salt Lake City to foreign destinations and alleged phony
corporations and contracts, according to reports in Salt Lake
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Utah attorney general has launched her own
probe into the Olympic bribery scandal.
</P>
<P>
   And two congressmen are pressing President Clinton to designate
the IOC as a ``public international organization,'' subject to a
treaty prohibiting Americans from bribing foreign officials.
Clinton is expected to act by Tuesday, the day before McCain's
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Olympic pool was not a cesspool, it certainly had
infectious bacteria in it,'' historian Lucas said. ``It most surely
is being stirred up.''

 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Just as the bruises have begun to fade, the battered
International Olympic Committee is about to take another hit: U.S.
politicians are waiting in the halls of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the lords of the rings convened an emergency session
in the security of their marble-clad compound on the shores of Lake
Geneva for a little blood-letting and wound-licking _ and a promise
to press ahead with an ethical cleansing to purge its past of
secrecy and self-dealing.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), not one to shy away from
cameras or controversy, wasn't impressed.
</P>
<P>
   Tough bills in works
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a possible Republican presidential candidate who is
convening his own IOC reform session Wednesday before the Senate
Commerce Committee, said the IOC effort fell far short of what was
needed ``to bring transparency and accountability to the
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain plans tough legislation to strip the IOC of its
tax-exempt status. And he hopes that hitting the international
organization where it hurts _ in its fat bank account will push the
IOC to take more action.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's view is that the IOC merely sacrificed a half-dozen
small fry, set up a couple of commissions chaired by its own
leader, Juan Antonio Samaranch, and washed its hands of the whole
unpleasantness. However, the senator was pleased that two big
names, Henry Kissinger and Peter Ueberroth, agreed last week to
serve on the IOC 2000 reform panel.
</P>
<P>
   McCain thinks Samaranch hasn't taken any of it seriously. Last
month, he closed the IOC meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland, by
proclaiming: ``We promised to clean house. We did it. We promised
reforms. We did it.''
</P>
<P>
   The 78-year-old Spaniard declined McCain's invitation to go
before the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation to
discuss the culture that corrupted Salt Lake City _ and presumably
other cities bidding to host the Olympics. That refusal prompted
McCain to fire off a statement suggesting that Samaranch did not
``understand the gravity of the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the IOC didn't even appear to notice the scandal until
nervous sponsors started withholding payments and calling Lausanne
last winter.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics is a $1 billion-a-year enterprise, and much of that
money comes from corporations seeking to link their products with
the idealized image of the Games. If that image is tainted, it
isn't worth as much to the Coca-Colas and Kodaks that pay $50
million for sponsor rights every four years.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's committee will hear proposed legislation from Sen. Ted
Stevens (R-Alaska) to limit tax deductions that U.S. companies can
take from their sponsorship fees and advertising expenses. For
those companies that claim the deductions, sponsoring the Games
suddenly becomes a far more costly proposition.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also would limit the IOC's access to billions of
dollars in fees for television rights by giving negotiating power
to the U.S. Olympic Committee, which already receives more Olympic
revenue than any other national Olympic committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``If more money were to come in to the U.S. and less would go to
other countries, that would cause some real anxiety and pain among
the other countries of the world and the IOC,'' said Bob Heussner
of Advantage International, Olympic marketing consultants based in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic scholar John J. MacAloon went even further. ``The USOC
does not own the property,'' MacAloon said. ``This is the pirates
emptying the safe while the ship is on rocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the world's premier Olympic scholars join the IOC in
opposing the U.S. government's intervention. The Olympics, they
say, operates outside of global politics, boycotts notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain is astute,'' said historian John Lucas of Penn State,
``but what he knows about the inner machinations of the Olympic
movement can be written on the back of a 33-cent postage stamp. It
would be presumptuous of me to go down to Washington and tell the
Finance Committee how to spend their money.''
</P>
<P>
   The historian thinks Congress has no credibility when it
scrutinizes a private, foreign organization but doesn't appear
interested in examining the United States' own Olympic committee,
the USOC, an organization over which it has jurisdiction under the
Olympic and Amateur Sports Act.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas, who has studied the Olympics for 45 years, acknowledges
that the IOC is in desperate need of reform. But he said, ``McCain
should have absolutely nothing to do directly or indirectly with an
organization that is European-based, international in nature and
mandated by the Swiss government as a nonprofit organization.''
</P>
<P>
   USOC backers to appear
</P>
<P>
   The USOC refuses to release the results of its own internal
investigation into what gifts its members received from bid cities.
It also will not divulge what actions it has taken against any
employees or board members, despite evidence that some probably
knew about Salt Lake City's million-dollar bribery campaign.
</P>
<P>
   MacAloon, a professor of anthropology at the University of
Chicago, said he thinks the USOC is setting the agenda for McCain's
hearings and will emerge unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled to speak are USOC President William Hybl and members
of a USOC-appointed investigation commission headed by former
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine. The commission's
report, issued last month, criticized the IOC for lacking openness
and creating a culture of gift giving that is ``potentially illegal
and inevitably corrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   If the hearings discuss the USOC's role in the scandal, MacAloon
said, ``Then it will be doing good service to the reform of the
Olympic movement. But if, instead, it holds hands with the USOC in
joyful IOC bashing, it will be a huge embarrassment.''
</P>
<P>
   Anita DeFrantz, an IOC member from Los Angeles, will represent
Samaranch. ``It is important for the IOC to be there and have it's
story come out,'' IOC Vice President Dick Pound said. ``And it's
better to have that come out of the mouth of a U.S. citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound, a Canadian who headed the IOC's internal investigation,
said he thinks that McCain's hearing are too late. ``I think it was
a hot issue in February before the IOC began to look at the whole
issue of restructuring,'' Pound said. `` A good deal of what they
seem to be looking for, we've already done.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said sponsors should be upset about congressional
interference.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were a Coca-Cola or Kodak or Xerox,'' Pound said, ``I
would wonder what Congress is proposing to do by monkeying with the
Internal Revenue Code, simply because there is some concern about
where a business expenditure is being directed. I would think that
kind of action would horrify the business community at large.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if McCain's hearing doesn't push the reform legislation
forward, the Olympics has more headaches to come.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Justice Department is expected to complete in June its
criminal investigation into Salt Lake City's bid tactics. Still
under investigation are questions about the commingling of personal
funds with Salt Lake bid committee accounts, the trail of money
from Salt Lake City to foreign destinations and alleged phony
corporations and contracts, according to reports in Salt Lake
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Utah attorney general has launched her own
probe into the Olympic bribery scandal.
</P>
<P>
   And two congressmen are pressing President Clinton to designate
the IOC as a ``public international organization,'' subject to a
treaty prohibiting Americans from bribing foreign officials.
Clinton is expected to act by Tuesday, the day before McCain's
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Olympic pool was not a cesspool, it certainly had
infectious bacteria in it,'' historian Lucas said. ``It most surely
is being stirred up.''

   KUKES, Albania _ The interior of Kosovo is a wasteland of burned
villages and wandering farm animals, empty of ethnic Albanians but
swarming with Serbian forces, refugees allowed to cross into
Albania said Saturday. They said that the Serbian forces included
tank columns moving in all directions and that troops were taking
up quarters in the ravaged houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a desert, what we have seen,'' said Jakup Slamaku, 41,
one of about 1,500 refugees who made a circuitous 12-hour journey
though central Kosovo from their village of Vragolija, just south
of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear why these villagers were moved out and allowed
to go to Albania overnight Friday, three days after the forces of
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic closed the border and drove
an estimated 80,000 refugees waiting to cross into Albania back
into Kosovo. Their fate remains unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The accounts of the arriving villagers provides a rare glimpse
inside Kosovo well into the third week of NATO's air campaign,
which began March 24. Foreign journalists, aid workers and monitors
were either evacuated from Kosovo or were expelled as Serbian
forces began their well-organized effort to drive out or displace
many of the province's majority ethnic Albanian population.
</P>
<P>
   The accounts suggested that, despite NATO air strikes, the Serbs
are still able to move and mass troops on the ground and appear to
be digging in against any possible ground attack. The accounts also
suggested that the Serbs have created such widespread destruction
that it will be difficult for the refugees to ever rebuild their
lives there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Along the road, I saw many horses and cows and sheep, but no
men,'' Slamaku said, resting with his wife in the teeming tent city
that Italians have built beside the road into Albania from the
border with Kosovo. ``There were no people, only Serb forces. I
have seen many tanks.''
</P>
<P>
   The villagers said they caught no glimpse of the tens of
thousands of refugees whose waiting column was suddenly turned back
in the middle of the night Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   They confirmed accounts of a line of burned and destroyed
tractors and other vehicles along the highway from Prizren to Szur,
the last village about three miles north of the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen many tractors burned,'' Slamaku said.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to the missing refugees, estimated by aid workers
to number 80,000, remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   [NATO officials published a map in Brussels showing three large
areas where they said up to 200,000 people have been forced to seek
shelter in the rubble of ruined villages or in the hills and
valleys of the countryside, but it was not clear whether the 80,000
were among them).
</P>
<P>
   Mysterious, too, was why the whole village of Vragolija was
allowed to leave after the Serbs slammed the border shut at
midweek.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility is that its location, on the southern approaches
to Kosovo's capital, Pristina, and near the city's military and
civilian airfield, was considered strategic and that the military
wanted to take it over as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The villagers said that as they gathered on the road to leave,
the Yugoslav Army shelled and then set fire to the village. Serbian
forces also tore up all their identity documents, saying it was to
insure they would never return, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The villagers said they had been surrounded for more than a week
by Serbian forces. At 9:30 on Friday morning, they said, they were
told they must vacate the village immediately. At first they
thought they must go on foot, but then they were sent back to get
their vehicles. Originally they were told they were going to
Macedonia, but as they left, they said, they were told the
destination was Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being directed along the main road that winds
directly southwest from Pristina through Prizren and to the border
with Albania, the refugees said, they were directed by troops at
each intersection over secondary highways in a wide loop about
three times as long, first west, then south to Djakovica, then east
again before hooking up with a highway below Prizren.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the choice of route was mysterious. The main road may
have been filled with military traffic. Or there may have been
something along that route that the Serbs did not want the
Albanians to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a desert,'' said Bashkim Pllana, 25, of the landscape he
traveled. ``There are houses burned and destroyed cars everywhere
on the street. There are horses and cows. Nobody was there but the
Serb forces, mainly the paramilitary, who jeered and insulted us
along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbian forces have left their barracks, and are
stationing themselves in the houses and the villages,'' he went on.
``Now they are in every village with tanks and artillery an every
kind of arms imaginable.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, villagers said, their refugee convoy was overtaken
by a column of about 20 tanks headed west from Pristina, traveling
both on their own tracks and on truck-like carriers.
</P>
<P>
   For six miles, said Xhemal Slavwiku, 64, ``I have seen a line of
burned trucks and tractors, and even where they killed the horses
and burned the carriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serb forces,'' he said, ``were moving in both directions,
both overtaking us and coming the other way.''

MONTENEGRO TRYING TO RESIST SERBIA'S DRAFT

   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia _ The Yugoslav army wants Dragon Soc.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers bearing conscription notices have come to his house on
three occasions, most recently on Thursday morning, to demand that
he come with them to their barracks near the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Soc said the draft notices are an insult and a provocation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a kind of teasing _ it makes the tension here rise every
day,'' he said, adding that under Yugoslav law his refusal to join
the army makes him subject to imprisonment as a draft dodger.
</P>
<P>
   Soc ought to know. He is the minister of justice for the
Yugoslav republic of Montenegro. His government has declared that
it wants nothing whatsoever to do with the brutal expulsions and
destruction that the army, under the command of President Slobodan
Milosevic, is carrying out in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The justice minister's draft dodging is part of a power struggle
here that Western governments fear could spill over into civil war.
It pits the democratically elected government of Montenegro against
the Yugoslav army controlled by Milosevic, which has about 12,000
troops inside the republic.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro and Serbia are all that is left of the six republics
that once made up Yugoslavia. With just 640,000 residents and a
leadership that is struggling to forge economic ties with the West,
Montenegro has emerged as the balky little brother in Milosevic's
dictatorial command of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The government here has not formally seceded, but it no longer
recognizes the legality of the federal government in Belgrade. The
republic's president, Milo Djukanovic, condemns what he calls
Milosevic's ``senseless policy of confrontation with the whole
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic on Thursday warned the commander of the Yugoslav army
in Montenegro, Gen. Milorad Obradovic, to order his troops to stop
breaking into the houses of citizens of Montenegro and forcibly
taking them into military service, said Branko Perovic, the foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``In recent days, besides trying to draft our minister of
justice, they are knocking down doors with armed police and taking
people away from their families by force,'' said Perovic, who said
that hundreds of Montenegrins had been drafted in that manner in
the last week, including several scores of people who run important
state institutions like schools and welfare centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president warned the general not to take any one of those
people who are important,'' said Perovic, adding that he did not
know what the army's response to the warning will be.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, even as he warned the army, Djukanovic went out of his
way to reassure the general that his government recognizes the
legitimacy of the army's role in this country, Perovic said.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO bombings of Yugoslavia have forced the government here
to try to square a circle _ to stand up to Milosevic's military and
resist the emergency authority it is trying to impose under the
martial law imposed as bombings began, on March 24, but to resist
in a way that does not hand Milosevic a pretext for a coup.
</P>
<P>
   Before the bombs, things were simpler. As two recent elections
proved, a majority of Montenegrins, despite their historical and
religious ties to Serbia, were delighted with Djukanovic's
overtures to the United States and Western Europe. They seemed to
appreciate his scathing criticism of Milosevic. Since the bombing
began 18 days ago, though, Djukanovic has said that all bets are
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to be very smart to understand that under these
circumstances it is very hard to speak about reforms and
democracy,'' Djukanovic told Corriere delle Sera, the Italian
daily, this week. ``It is now very easy for Milosevic to manipulate
Montenegrins.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav army is now busy in Montenegro trying to carry out
the general call-up of reservists and new recruits that was ordered
by Milosevic as part of a declaration of martial law. The
Montenegrin government has been just as busy in the last 2{ weeks
trying to devise ways to give comfort, alternatives and excuses to
the large number of young men here who believe it would be insane
to serve in the Milosevic military.
</P>
<P>
   Such young Montenegrins are not hard to find. ``I am still
young, and I don't want to get killed,'' said Dejan Nikolic, 22, a
reservist who has received and ignored two notices demanding that
he report to an army anti-aircraft battery near Podgorica.
</P>
<P>
   There is an honored tradition of war in Montenegro. From the
14th to the 19th centuries, the main business of the tribal people
who lived here was fighting the Ottoman Turks, who never completely
conquered this mountainous republic. The Turks did conquer Serbia,
despite the best efforts of Montenegrins to help their Orthodox
brothers resist that defeat.
</P>
<P>
   All this history adds up to a relationship between Montenegrins
and Serbs that might be summed up as, ``I like you, but I think you
might be taking advantage of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Montenegrins have been more than willing to help Serbia fight
its battles. Beginning with Serbia's loss to the Turks in Kosovo in
1389, on through two world wars and finally during Milosevic's
losing battles in Croatia and Bosnia, Montenegrins did their bit
for Yugoslav solidarity. Indeed, Radovan Karadzic, leader of
Bosnia's Serbs during the 1992-95 war, comes from Montenegro, as
does the family of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But many Montenegrins say that in the back of their minds, there
has always been a sneaking suspicion that they were being played as
patsies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a saying that the Serbs will fight until the last
Montenegrin gets killed,'' said Velko Vlahovic, 30, a pilot who is
a reservist in the Yugoslav army.
</P>
<P>
   The Montenegrin government has devised a system of excuses that
conscripts can show to the Yugoslav army to be legally exempted
from military service. It's called ``obligatory working duty.''
Under this system, a reporter at Montenegrin television, for
example, could get a note from his editor saying that he is doing
essential work.
</P>
<P>
   Momir Krivacevic, 26, a reporter at Montenegrin television, did
exactly that. He sent his exemption letter to the army. But the
army sent it back, saying he still must serve. Krivacevic said that
soldiers have come looking for him at the television station.
</P>
<P>
   What is he going do to?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask the army, I have to go,'' Krivacevic said. ``If you
ask me, no chance. I don't recognize the federal army as legal
anymore in Montenegro. But if the Montenegrin police call me, I
will go.''
</P>
<P>
   Those police units, a force of about 8,000 that reports to the
Montenegrin president, have accepted as volunteers about a hundred
draft dodgers with military skills, according to a government
official.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, of course, is a draft dodger. Dejan Cvijanovic,
28, a computer specialist at the pro-Milosevic newspaper, Dan, has
volunteered to join the army and go to Kosovo to fight NATO. He
says he is awaiting orders. Cvijanovic says he is eager to fight,
and he believes the Montenegrin government is guilty of historical
and cultural treachery by backing away from the defense of Kosovo.
Sooner or later, he says, this treachery will force the army to
overthrow the government in Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo is our sacred place,'' he said. ``I didn't support
Milosevic before, but at this moment he is my president and my
leader. We will win, of course. God is on our side. Every bomb
dropped on Kosovo is a bomb dropped on Jesus Christ himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The minister of justice, meanwhile, is annoyed with the army's
temerity in upsetting what he said has been a longstanding Yugoslav
tradition of exempting elected officials from military service.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was elected to the Montenegrin Parliament in 1992, I
was a member of the army reserves and I had to resign from my
military position,'' Soc said. ``Now they are coming to a
minister's house and saying `come with us.'''

<P>
   MOSCOW _ As Orthodox Christians from Moscow to Belgrade, from
Athens to Bucharest, start celebrating Easter at midnight services
Saturday night, the usual joy of this most sacred of holidays has
been tinged with feelings of unease, grief, fear and anger over the
continuing conflict in Yugoslavia, home of their Orthodox brethren,
the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Not only church leaders, but also politicians from predominantly
Orthodox countries have appealed for an Easter cease-fire, on the
ground and from the air. The latest was a telephone call Friday
night to NATO General-Secretary Javier Solana by Romanian President
Emil Constantinescu, a supporter of NATO policy who asked that NATO
warplanes stop their bombing on a day of ``great spiritual
significance'' for Orthodox Christians.
</P>
<P>
   In Athens Friday, anti-NATO demonstrators joined traditional
Good Friday processions, with vociferous calls for a halt to the
bombing. And in Russia, Aleksei II, Patriarch of Moscow and All
Russia, in recent remarks, questioned the morality of those who
would continue to bomb on Easter Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they carry on bombing over Orthodox Easter, what kind of
Christians are they?'' he asked, in a statement aired on the Voice
of Russia radio station on April 6. ``They are not Christians, they
are barbarians.''
</P>
<P>
   In a televised address Friday night, the patriarch called on
both NATO and Yugoslav leaders to end ``the vicious cycle of
violence'' and appealed for calm in Russia itself, where the war in
the Balkans has added a note of belligerence to the national
political debate.
</P>
<P>
   For many Orthodox Christians, the latest war in Yugoslavia has
posed a deep moral dilemma, as they struggle between concern for
their fellow Orthodox Serbs now living under NATO attack and
disgust with Serbian policies in the predominantly Albanian
province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to affect the joy of the day,'' said the Rev. Daniel
Hubiak, an American parish priest at an Orthodox church in Moscow.
``All of this only points to the message in one of our readings
today. `Do not put your trust in princes, in sons of men.' Christ
is our only hope, and in the final analysis, He is the one who is
going to judge all of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost all Orthodox church leaders have joined in calls to end
the violence in Yugoslavia, just as Pope John Paul II and other
Christian leaders led an appeal for a cease-fire last Sunday, when
the rest of the Christian world celebrated Easter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the religious leadership of the Christian churches,
without covert or overt coordination, has been calling for roughly
the same thing, for a cessation of the violence, not just a
pause,'' said the Rev. Leonid Kiskovsky, ecumenical officer of the
Orthodox Church of America.
</P>
<P>
   In Bulgaria, where the Orthodox church has been split by a
dispute between rival patriarchs, the church's voice been
relatively muted. But in a newspaper aligned with the Bulgarian
Socialist Party, a recent front page showed a picture of Christ on
the cross under attack by Stealth bombers, beneath a headline that
read ``Their Easter.''
</P>
<P>
   In Greece, a NATO member with an overwhelmingly Orthodox
population, the government of Prime Minister Costas Simitis has
also appealed for an Easter cease-fire, most recently during a
visit to Athens by a top State Department official, Strobe Talbott.
</P>
<P>
   With the Greek Orthodox Church in the lead, Greek popular
opinion has been generally critical of the NATO campaign, fueled in
part by sympathy for the Serbs and by lingering resentments against
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In a traditional Easter message distributed by the Serbian
Orthodox Church, the theological message of Christ's resurrection
was followed by a last-minute addition, a paragraph accusing NATO
of causing the catastrophe that has sent hundreds of thousands of
people fleeing their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The mood in one Belgrade church this morning was one of unease
and anger, said the Rev. Radomir Rakic in a telephone interview.
``We would not like this Easter to be like the Easter of 1941, when
the Nazis bombed Belgrade, or Easter 1944 when the Allies bombed at
the end of the war,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were celebrating the liturgy this morning when believe me
or not, as I was reading the Gospel at about 9:25, just when I was
reading the Easter Greeting of the Angel at the Tomb, `Rejoice, He
is not here,' at that very same moment, we could hear the air raid
siren,'' said Rakic. ``And I thought, my good God, we are listening
to the happiness of these words, and to the alarm, at the same
time. But when the all-clear signal was sounded, we didn't hear it,
because we were deep in prayer.''

ARKANSAS TEMPERS JUSTICE IN NEW LAW FOR JUVENILES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ark.)  (lb) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ After two boys shot up their schoolyard in
Jonesboro in March of last year, killing five people and riveting a
nation, Paul Kelly feared the worst for Arkansas' juvenile justice
system. The boys, 11 and 13, were too young to be prosecuted as
adults under state law, and angry lawmakers seemed to be trampling
one another in their efforts to make it easier to imprison
youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was talk about frying these kids, and anyone else like
them,'' said Kelly, the senior program coordinator for Arkansas
Advocates for Children and Families, a nonprofit group that
supports children's rights. ``There were legislators who wanted to
be able to try a child of any age as an adult.''
</P>
<P>
   But something unexpected happened since Jonesboro became a
national symbol of prepubescent violence. Though the state was
deeply traumatized by the shootings and many residents were furious
that a harsh punishment could not be imposed on the killers,
officials did not write a law that simply moves children into the
adult justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, state leaders brought in child-development specialists,
consulted both prosecutors and defense lawyers, and came up with a
far more tempered bill than anyone on either side had expected.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation removes the blanket prohibition against trying
children age 14 and under as adults.
</P>
<P>
   But it imposes a significant burden if prosecutors want to
charge children younger than 13 as adults. The prosecutors will
have to show that the youngsters understand the criminality of
their conduct and fully appreciate the outcome of their actions,
among several other psychological tests. National experts say this
is one of the most carefully drawn provisions on juvenile justice
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas may sometimes be seen as one of an undifferentiated
mass of conservative Southern states, but it has its own stubbornly
progressive streak, some of which was on display when Gov. Mike
Huckabee, a Republican, signed the juvenile justice bill into law
at a Capitol ceremony on Wednesday. There in the room stood Kelly,
along with several other children's advocates who had been prepared
to oppose the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've really put some good protections in there for younger
children,'' said Didi Sallings, the executive director of the
Arkansas Public Defender Commission, who wrote the psychological
sections of the bill at the behest of the state Senate. ``It will
be a rare kid who can pass the competency test and be tried as an
adult, which is just the way I intended it.''
</P>
<P>
   But notably absent from the signing ceremony were the
prosecutors in the Jonesboro case, and the relatives of the four
schoolgirls and one teacher who were killed that day, most of whom
resolutely oppose the new law as far too weak.
</P>
<P>
   Brent Davis, the lead prosecutor in the case, said that if the
law had been in effect at the time of the slayings, it would still
have been impossible to try the two killers as adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pity the prosecutor who has to try to figure out this law,''
Davis said. ``It started out as a good effort, but then they let
all these people from the criminal defense bar work on it to make
it a consensus bill, and they loaded it up with all this
psychobabble. There's no real likelihood this law could be used.''
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of the victims have also criticized the law as unfair
and insensitive.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, however, was the only prosecutor in the state to speak
out against the bill; other district attorneys helped draft its
language. The sponsor of the bill, state Sen. Thomas Kennedy, a
former prosecutor, said the Legislature had to put aside the
objections from people close to the Jonesboro case.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want public policy to be purely reactionary in
nature,'' said Kennedy, D-Russellville, which is northwest of
Little Rock and halfway across the state from Jonesboro. ``I like
and respect Brent, but he's wrong. He was so close to the Jonesboro
case that he did not necessarily approach this issue absent of
emotion.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, Kennedy's comments are surprising, because he was
one of the first to demand tougher sentencing for juveniles the day
after the shooting. ``There are certain crimes which are so
egregious that we cannot allow these offenders to feel anything
less than the full impact of the law,'' he said that day.
</P>
<P>
   But the passage of time _ along with a lobbying blitz from
social workers and children's advocates _ significantly moderated
his view and that of most other legislators.
</P>
<P>
   The juvenile crime rate is falling in Arkansas, as it is across
the nation, and after a year, the Jonesboro shooting came to be
seen as a fluke, however horrendous. Had the Legislature been in
session at the time of the shooting, many people around the capital
agree, the law might have been much more stringent.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the law clearly improves the chances that prosecutors
can try more serious juvenile crimes in adult courts, with adult
punishments. Previously, there was simply no way that anyone
younger than 14 could face long-term punishment, even if they were
convicted of capital murder, as the Jonesboro killers were.
</P>
<P>
   The new law removes that absolute barrier, making it possible to
sentence a child of any age to life in prison for capital murder,
although it is progressively harder to impose that sentence on
younger children.
</P>
<P>
   The law borrows an idea that first became popular in Minnesota
called ``blended sentencing,'' in which children who receive long
sentences for major crimes would have their sentences reviewed by a
judge at age 18 to see if they had been at all rehabilitated. The
judge would have the option of continuing their sentence in adult
prison or releasing them.
</P>
<P>
   Except for capital murder convictions, juveniles could not
receive sentences longer than 40 years, and no child under 16 could
be sent to an adult prison. Previously, children 14 and older could
be sent to prison if convicted as adults, but those convicted as
juveniles have been released at age 18 because the state has no
institution to hold them from the ages of 18 to 21.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last seven years, almost every state has made it easier
for juveniles to be tried as adults, in many cases in response to
highly publicized cases of violence. But though Jonesboro was the
site of the most notorious of those cases, Arkansas' juvenile rules
are still more lenient than those of many states.
</P>
<P>
   Some states, for example, require adult trials of juveniles 13
or older in murder cases. Others have no minimum age for which a
murder suspect can be tried as an adult, or have a minimum age
below 13.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Laurence Steinberg, a Temple University psychology professor
who directs the MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Adolescent
Development and Juvenile Justice, said the psychological test
required by Arkansas for those 13 and younger was important because
the adolescent brain is still developing at that age. His testimony
and that of other experts before a panel set up last year by
Huckabee was critical in getting the competency language inserted
into the new law.
</P>
<P>
   The bill does nothing to improve the condition of the state's
poorly managed juvenile institutions, which have been the subject
of several newspaper exposes, or to limit the youngsters' access to
guns. Many people in Jonesboro have lamented the lack of any real
deterrent growing out of the shootings, but the strength of their
emotions has isolated them from the mainstream consensus in the
rest of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone can understand that as victims, they feel the need to
punish, punish, punish,'' said Ms. Sallings, the public defender.
``But the Legislature agreed that you can't change the entire
criminal justice system just to fit a certain set of facts, no
matter how bad they happened to be.''

 &HT;    Partially engraved headstones will need Y2K fix
 &HT;    By Steve Bennish
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ You might call it the Y2K _ RIP problem.
</P>
<P>
   Families have long purchased headstones in advance, hoping to
spare surviving members additional expense after a family member
dies. They pay engravers to etch the century date in the stones,
with the last two numbers carved after death.
</P>
<P>
   But because so many people are now living longer than
anticipated _ and will likely pass the millennium mark in good
health _ local memorial companies say they'll have their hands full
correcting the ``19'' on the headstones to ``20'' after Jan. 1,
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Why headstone purchasers made the presumption that they'd die
before 2000 is anybody's guess, although industry professionals say
that sparing relatives additional expenses down the line is a
common motive.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, partial date stones appear to be more common in
the Midwest than in other areas of the nation, said William Minozzi
of the Monument Builders of North America, an industry trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Hopkins, superintendant of David's Cemetery, estimates
that at least 100 stones there have partial death dates.
</P>
<P>
   Most companies stopped including the partial death dates on
their pre-paid stones in the early '80s, Hopkins said. But that
still leaves perhaps up to 1 percent of all stones with partial
dates.
</P>
<P>
   Fixing the stones won't be cheap. The process involves mixing
epoxy with granite to fill the numbers and then recarving the
stone. Carving just the year can cost about $100. More is charged
for full dates with month and day.

 &HT;    Women leverage the links
 &HT;    By Angela Townsend
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ You've snagged a precious four hours with a
potential client and serious golfer who _ if you signed her _ would
catapult your standing with the boss overnight. To make a good
impression, you take her out for a round of golf.
</P>
<P>
   The first few holes go well, with a steady banter of friendly
talk about business, families and the like.
</P>
<P>
   But on the eighth hole, it all falls apart; you crack a joke
during her backswing and break her concentration. Your big title
and prestigious civic club memberships hurtle down the fairway of
professional failure.
</P>
<P>
   Networking with a 9-iron has been second nature for businessmen
for decades. Women, still relatively new at navigating the
corporate ladder, are at a disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   To alleviate that, the Kettering/Moraine/Oakwood Area Chamber of
Commerce on Friday (April 16) is hosting a Working Women's Luncheon
titled, ``Networking in Golf.''
</P>
<P>
   The luncheon, expected to draw more than 50 people, will include
a lesson with the golf pro at Country Club of the North, as well as
a presentation on how to use golf properly as a networking tool.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Molly Brown-Boula and Kim Grant come in.
</P>
<P>
   Founders of Executive Sport Networking, a corporate and
executive training company based in Brown-Boulay's Springboro home,
the women conduct seminars on using golf as an effective networking
tool.
</P>
<P>
   While neither woman claims to be any more than a novice on the
greens, both have done their share of circulating within golfing
circles. Grant is tournament coordinator for the Firstar LPGA
Classic. Brown-Boulay, who until April 1998 was interim director of
alumni relations at Wright State University and is now a free-lance
writer, has a background in event planning and management.
</P>
<P>
   For the past year, Grant and Brown-Boulay have been developing
and holding seminars tailored to the needs of individual companies
or other organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The sessions do much more than assuage the fears of those who
are afraid of looking stupid on the course. ``If you're intimidated
by golfing, go out and watch the first tee; you will see some ugly
swings,'' Brown-Boulay said.
</P>
<P>
   They also address questions that a simple golf lesson can't
cover, such as: When do you conduct business on the course? Do you
actually bring a contract out to sign? Do you engage in gambling
games? Do you drink or smoke? What about tipping?
</P>
<P>
   Executive Sports Networking is currently working with a large
bank headquartered in Chicago to hold a seminar later this year for
nine of its top female executives, and has begun scheduling other
events to be held in and around the Miami Valley through fall.
</P>
<P>
   Executive Sports Networking has few peers. There are only about
a dozen other such organizations, mostly in large cities like San
Francisco, Washington, D.C., and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   But with women making up almost 40 percent of all beginning
golfers in the country, according to the National Golf Foundation,
the need for such services has grown, said Nancy Oliver.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a competitive world, you need every advantage,'' said
Oliver, who founded the Executive Women's Golf Association in 1991.
``Women are finding that some of the tools they need to bring with
them include the ability to entertain corporate clients in the same
way men have.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver, who for a dozen years had been handling corporate public
relations accounts and organizing golf events around Florida, knew
that if she relied solely on lessons from a golf pro, she'd come
away knowing how to swing the club, but unaware of how to play the
game _ golf terminology, proper attire and how to behave on the
golf course.
</P>
<P>
   Wanting to learn the game in a nonthreatening atmosphere, she
organized an eight-week clinic for local businesswomen. Today, EWG
has 90 chapters and 13,000 members in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   K/M/O Chamber executive director Michelle Hughes is encouraged
by the interest in the upcoming luncheon, part of a series of
topics aimed at female chamber members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time women have the opportunity for relationship building,
it's an advantage,'' Hughes said. ``We want to make it convenient
and easy for them.''

COUNTRY CLUB MEETS ENEMY: COUNTRY, AND PIGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (lb) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STUART, Fla. _ Two worlds collide, on the 15th tee.
</P>
<P>
   On one side of the skinny blacktop road, the manicured fairways
of the Florida Club golf course meander through the palmetto scrub,
where a solitary golfer with a retirement tan hacks hard at the
ball and then chases it down in his golf cart, like a duck after a
June bug.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, 165 mud-spattered pigs wallow, grunt, scratch
and squeal under the skimpy shade of the same southeast Florida
scrub, and the stench, from the animals, the manure and the mounds
of rotting lettuce, tomatoes and moldy bread that they consume,
hits the people who turn in the sandy driveway like a punch in the
nose.
</P>
<P>
   Country music _ at the moment the Dixie Chicks, singing on WIRK
radio about crying mamas and wide open spaces _ mingles with the
smell and the heat and the squeals, and the whole experience drifts
across the scrub, across the road and onto the carefully tended
greens of the Florida Club course.
</P>
<P>
   The pigs' owner, a big, ruddy-faced, white-haired, sunburned man
named Paul Thompson, sits in the shade beside the fly-blown pens
and shakes his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now who,'' he said, ``would choose to build a golf course next
to a pig farm? Didn't they read the sign? It says `pig farm,' not
`rose garden.'''
</P>
<P>
   He shakes his head again.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they say I'm crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a confrontation of old and new Florida, here in this corner
of Martin County about 30 minutes north of Palm Beach, was bound to
lead to lawyers. But it is the music, not the smell, that has
Thompson in court, defending his right to play Merle Haggard, Garth
Brooks and Dolly Parton for his pigs. He swears it improves their
disposition.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Club, a golf course and subdivision with homes that
sell for around $300,000, is suing Thompson, 60, and another
farmer, claiming that the country music they play bothers its
golfers.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson says he is being told how to live his life by the new,
richer residents who are encroaching on what used to be a wild,
simple place, ``just one more case of the rich developers running
over the little guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he knew the developers were rich, he smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I've never seen a poor developer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A trial date has not been set.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Cotten, the general manager of the Florida Club, insists
that its members only want to play in peace, and that the legal
challenge is a simple lawsuit designed to halt a nuisance. The club
seeks no damages, just reduced volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy is persisting with his story of the big developers
squeezing him out,'' which is false, Cotten said. ``He's welcome to
stay there.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the club have said that Thompson and the neighbor
who also raises music-accented pork, Tom Rossano, want the club to
buy their property at an inflated price, to gain peace and quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Cotten said Thompson also liked being courted by the media.
``He's just a lonely guy who's enjoying the attention,'' Cotten
said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he was playing the country music in an effort to
get the club to buy his three acres, Thompson said no.
</P>
<P>
   He was here first, in 1957, 38 years before the country club, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked whether he would consider selling his property,
Thompson replied that ``everything is for sale, if someone is
willing to sell, and someone is willing to buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I can't force anybody to buy me out,'' and certainly, he
said, not by playing country music.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I pulled up in my car here for the first time, in '57,
there was country music on the radio,'' Thompson said. Over the
years, he read studies about how music made cows give more milk,
made chickens lay more eggs and even made small children in
day-care centers happier.
</P>
<P>
   What was good for humans must be good for pigs, he reasoned. He
found that the music soothed the pigs, and made them less prone to
attack each other in their tight surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   The pigs, Thompson said, do not know the difference between
styles of music, between Handel and Hank Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play country,'' he said, ``because I like country.''
</P>
<P>
   The golfers, bent over their Big Bertha drivers, trying to
cleanly strike a small white sphere, have found that hard to do
with George Jones warbling: ``It's that teeny-weeny, itsy-bitsy
thing we call the love bug.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson has no sympathy for them. He does not play golf.
</P>
<P>
   He considers the golfers hypocrites, people who do not want to
know where their pork comes from.
</P>
<P>
   ``Standing around moaning about me, with a pork chop in their
mouth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The battle with the country club has been raging for the past
year, and so far the law seems to be on the pig farmers' side.
</P>
<P>
   Checks on the noise level of the music by deputies of the Martin
County Sheriff's Department and the neighboring St. Lucie County
Sheriff's Department found that the music at both Thompson's and
Rossano's farms was below the 60 decibels allowed in residential
areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no violation,'' said Jenell Atlas, the public
information officer for the Martin County Sheriff's Office.
Thompson has ``been out there many, many years. As far as we're
concerned, he's not breaking the law.''
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, it seems a lopsided battle. One of the
country club's lawyers is Tom Warner, a Republican state
representative.
</P>
<P>
   And within the past year, the country club pushed for and won a
new ordinance that set a decibel level for residential areas _ the
very one that Thompson has been obeying.
</P>
<P>
   But Thompson is no backwoods farmer, despite the pig flop on his
boots. He has his own Web site _ www.pigfarmer.com _ and now he has
his own legal defense fund, the Paul Thompson-Pig Farmer Legal
Defense Fund, to be precise.
</P>
<P>
   It will give him a chance, he said, against the country club.
</P>
<P>
   Why not just turn the music down, he is asked. Well, he said,
the pigs could not hear it, and, worse than that, it would be
giving up.
</P>
<P>
   And when he gives up, he said, it will be only when ``they're
carrying me out of here, walking slow and singing low.''
</P>
<P>
   Appropriately, John Anderson comes on the radio a few minutes
later, singing about a dying way of life in Florida:
</P>
<P>
   ``Blow, blow Seminole wind.
</P>
<P>
   Blow like it's never gonna blow again.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to tell if the pigs are impressed.

WASHINGTON TALK: SOFT MONEY AND SOME NOT-SO-HARD PROMISES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bookshelves in the capital are sagging with
countless handsomely bound, carefully researched, long-forgotten
reports proposing laws and policies that, were they ever to be
adopted, would affect millions of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   One characteristic of these studies _ about Social Security,
taxes, health policy, education and dozens of other areas _ is that
the people who conduct them and make the recommendations often do
not themselves follow the prescriptions in their own daily lives
that they would impose on the body politic.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point involves the report advocating sweeping changes
in campaign finance laws published last month by the Committee for
Economic Development, an organization of business executives. The
report's principal recommendation is that soft money, the
unregulated donations that corporations can give to political
parties, should be outlawed. OK
</P>
<P>
   Corporations and unions have long been prohibited from giving
money directly to political candidates, but in recent elections,
they have gotten around the restrictions by donating large sums to
the parties.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1998 elections, corporations and business trade groups
gave a record $121 million in soft money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public cannot help but believe that these donors enjoy
special influence and receive special favors,'' the report stated.
``The suspicion of corruption deepens public cynicism and
diminishes public confidence in government. More important, these
activities raise the likelihood of actual corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference where the report was released, a
co-chairman of the subcommittee that conducted the study, Edward A.
Kangas, chairman and chief executive of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu,
the accounting and consulting firm, declared, ``Bad government is
bad business.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``We fundamentally look at our campaign financing and
election processes, and we see many of the same fissures and cracks
in the foundation that led to the collapse of financial markets
elsewhere in the world, and we ask, `What might that hold for us
here in America?'''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he told a reporter, ``Until I understood the depth of
the problem, I was like a lot of Americans: I don't think I cared
too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, it appears that Kangas' firm has no intention of
restricting its own soft money donations. For the 1998 elections,
Deloitte &AMP; Touche, the American subsidiary of Deloitte Touche
Tohmatsu, gave $185,300 to the Republican Party and $41,725 to the
Democratic Party, Federal Election Commission records show.
</P>
<P>
   Kangas was in Europe this week and told associates to say he was
too tied up in meetings to return a reporter's telephone calls. But
Ellen Ringel, the spokeswoman for Deloitte &AMP; Touche, provided this
statement: `` Kangas' views with regard to his participation in the
CED report are his personal views and do not necessarily represent
the views of Deloitte &AMP; Touche in the United States and will not
require Deloitte &AMP; Touche in the United States to do anything but
what is in the best interest of the partnership within the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ringel said Kangas had approved the statement.
</P>
<P>
   Kangas is not the first corporate executive to conclude that
soft money donations were a bad investment. In 1997, as a Senate
committee was exposing widespread abuses in campaign finance
practices by both parties, four large American corporations
announced that they were forswearing soft money donations.
</P>
<P>
   A review of Election Commission records shows that the companies
have basically kept their word, but three have reneged to a minor
extent. For example, General Motors, which gave more than $400,000
in soft money in the 1996 elections, gave no corporate money for
last year's races, but it allowed its political action committee to
donate $40,000 to the Republican National Committee after the 1997
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Political action committees are run by corporate officers, but
the money comes from ostensibly voluntary donations, usually from
executives. They are allowed to give up to $25,000 to political
committees set up by the parties. Presumably, the Republican Party
classified GM's 1997-1998 donations as soft money because they
exceeded that limit.
</P>
<P>
   Harry J. Pearce, vice chairman of GM, said in an interview that
the company's policy applied to corporate funds, not to the
political action committee. Pearce said that he was satisfied with
the self-imposed ban on corporate spending on politics and that it
would not be changed.
</P>
<P>
   The Ameritech Corp., the Midwest telephone company, which gave
nearly $200,000 in the 1996 elections, gave about $60,000 in 1997
and 1998. Some of this was also from a political action committee.
Most of the rest, said Gary Lytle, head of the company's Washington
office, apparently resulted from executives around the country not
understanding what the rules were.
</P>
<P>
   Allied Signal, the aerospace company, which gave about $200,000
in the 1996 elections, gave $15,000 a year to the Republican Party
in 1997 and 1998. Ken Cole, vice president for government
relations, said that the money had been earmarked for conferences
of the Republican Governors' Association and that the company had
been assured that it would not be used for election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The one corporation that has completely stuck by its guns is the
Monsanto Co., which donated about $75,000 in 1995 and 1996 and has
given no soft money since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we said what we were going to do, we meant it,'' said
Philip Angell, spokesman in Monsanto's Washington office. As for
making an exception for PAC money, Angell said, ``Either you are or
you aren't, and we've decided we're not.''

OPPONENTS SAY TV STATION DEAL IS A RACIAL SHAM
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Md., N.C., Okla., Pa., Wis.)  (rk) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It is hard to typecast Edwin Edwards, a black
businessman from Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   To his admirers, Edwards is a pioneer: the first black person to
own a television station in a top 20 broadcast market, Pittsburgh.
Owner of seven television stations in cities including Baltimore,
Raleigh, N.C., and Milwaukee, and in the process of buying others,
Edwards is the model of an entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   He is also active in the Boy Scouts, sits on the board of the
Pittsburgh Urban League and is co-sponsor of an annual affair for
African-Americans who have made significant contributions to the
black residents of Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   His detractors, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH
Coalition, draw another portrait. To them, Edwards is a sham whose
company, Glencairn Limited, is little more than a black front to
enable a major white company, Sinclair Broadcasting, to evade the
federal ban on owning more than one television station in a given
market. They say this type of relationship undermines support for
affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Edwards' critics are seeking to block a complex
deal in which Glencairn would acquire four television stations,
including one in Oklahoma City, where Sinclair already owns a
television station. Both Jackson's organization and rival station
owners have complained that the deal is nothing more than a means
to allow Sinclair to own two stations in the Oklahoma City market.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Jackson's group note that 97 percent of the stock in
Edwards' company is held by Carolyn Smith, the mother of David,
Frederick, Duncan and Robert Smith, the four men who control
Sinclair, or by their children. Ms. Smith and the children also
have an option to buy the remaining 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while Glencairn owns the licenses of Edwards'
television stations, in each case he has, for a fee, ceded control
over programming, advertising and personnel, as well as buildings,
transmitters and other physical assets, to Sinclair.
</P>
<P>
   All of Edwards' stations also are in markets where Sinclair
already owns a television station.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glencairn appears to be determined to immortalize itself as
the poster child for sham ownership structures,'' lawyers for
Kelley International Licensing, a competing television company,
wrote in a complaint to the Federal Communications Commission last
December.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards and lawyers for Sinclair deny any subterfuge, saying the
commission has on several occasions approved Glencairn's ownership
structure and its purchase of stations in markets where Sinclair
already had stations. They also note that the stock held by the
Smith family consists of nonvoting shares.
</P>
<P>
   And they say it is strange that the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition is
trying to discredit an effort that has given a black man a foothold
in the overwhelming white club of television station owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud of my relationship with Sinclair,'' Edwards
said in an interview on Thursday. ``It's a beautiful, beautiful
family whom I've worked with and who have helped me. Isn't that
what we're trying to say to other broadcasters in this day and age
_ reach out and help minorities gain a foothold in ownership
opportunities?''
</P>
<P>
   But some advocates for minority ownership of television and
radio stations worry that Edwards' relationship with Sinclair gives
affirmative action efforts in business a bad name. They note that
in 1995, Congress repealed a program that gave tax breaks to
white-owned companies that sold television stations to minorities.
Deals like those between Edwards and Sinclair, these advocates say,
hurt efforts to have such programs restored.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the danger of the Glencairn-Sinclair deal,'' said James
Winston, president of the National Association of Black
Broadcasters. ``It gives some in Congress the excuse not to promote
black ownership.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The questions about Glencairn and its relationship with Sinclair
give a racial twist to the issue of the growing number of
television station owners who agree to give up control of their
operations to other companies, sometimes companies that already own
stations in the same market.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC estimates that there are more than 100 of these
arrangements across the country. The commission is considering
whether companies that operate television stations under these
agreements, like Sinclair, should be considered de facto owners. If
they are, then the commission's prohibition against owning more
than one station in a market would apply.
</P>
<P>
   The latest wrinkle in the long-running dispute between Edwards
and Sinclair on one side, and several competing companies and the
Rainbow/PUSH Coalition on the other, involves the Oklahoma City
transaction. It is part of a complex deal in which Sinclair paid
nearly $100 million to merge with Sullivan Broadcast Holdings,
which owns 11 television stations. As part of the deal, four of
those stations, including KOKH-TV in Oklahoma City, were
transferred to Glencairn.
</P>
<P>
   Among those companies competing with KOKH-TV is KFOR-TV, a
station owned by The New York Times Co. The company has not filed a
formal complaint about the transfer of the station to Glencairn.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, Glencairn agreed to cede day-to-day control
of nearly all of the programming on the Oklahoma City station to
Sinclair. In addition, both Sinclair and Glencairn used the same
bank, Chase Manhattan, and the same loan officer to arrange
financing.
</P>
<P>
   Glencairn paid nothing outright to acquire the four stations,
but did agree to assume a debt that had been held by Sullivan. At
one point, in papers submitted to the FCC, Edwards said the debt
amounted to $80 million. He later revised that figure, saying the
amount of the debt was actually about $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards' detractors said his confusion over the amount of debt
he was assuming in a deal that would expand his television empire
by more than two-thirds was evidence that he was merely a
figurehead for his company and therefore unfamiliar with the
transactions that were being carried out in his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are the owner, at the very least you should know the
price you are paying,'' said Andrew Schwartzman, president of the
Media Access Project, which seeks to increase the number of radio
and television stations owned by minorities.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Edwards said he had made an honest mistake. ``If
this is the only thing the petitioners have to stand on, it's
laughable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as a result of the protest raised by the Rainbow/PUSH
Coalition and Kelley, the FCC last month asked Sinclair to provide
more details about the transaction. Federal officials declined to
comment on their requests.

RECIPIENTS OF WELFARE ARE FEWEST SINCE 1969  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton announced Saturday that fewer
people were on welfare than at any point in the last three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Welfare caseloads have dropped by 4.6 million, or 38 percent,
since Clinton signed the Republican-initiated overhaul of the
welfare system into law in August 1996. There are now 7.6 million
people on welfare, according to the government's just-collected
figures from December, down from 14.1 million when Clinton took
office in January 1993.
</P>
<P>
   As the nation's economy continues its expansion, the new welfare
numbers, the lowest since 1969, not surprisingly coincide with
record drops in unemployment _ to 4.2 percent in March, the lowest
level in 29 years.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the new welfare figures in his weekly radio
address, Clinton said that the federal government had been doing
its share to help move welfare recipients into the work force.
</P>
<P>
   He said the government had hired 12,000 welfare recipients in
the last two years, surpassing the goal he set in March 1997 to
hire 10,000 welfare recipients by September 2000. Private companies
participating in the nonprofit Welfare to Work Partnership have
hired more than 410,000 welfare recipients, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he wanted to continue to drive down the number of
welfare recipients by implementing the final two rules that were
part of the 1996 welfare law. These would hold states accountable
for moving people off welfare, and make it easier for states to use
their welfare block grants to pay for child care, transportation
and other needs to help welfare recipients hold jobs.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the states failed to use the full amounts of
their federal welfare grants last year. State officials have said
that their welfare rolls dropped much faster than they anticipated,
in part because of the strong economy, making it difficult for them
to use all the federal money they were entitled to. Others have
admitted to just socking the money away to use in a recession.
</P>
<P>
   All 50 states have reduced their welfare rolls since January
1993, with 29 states cutting their rolls by more than 50 percent.

   KOSOVO-GITMO _ MIAMI _ Aritonne Georges, a Haitian in Lake
Worth, Fla., grew up in the hemisphere's poorest country and spent
three days in a flimsy boat trying to flee a brutal dictatorship.
Yet some of the worst days of his life were spent at Guantanamo
Bay, Cuba, which he calls a ``hell on earth.'' Those people
familiar with the U.S. naval base, like Georges, are appalled at
the idea of Kosovo refugees being housed there. So it's no wonder
the Clinton administration so far can't find any refugees willing
to come to Cuba. As a result, the Clinton administration appears to
be re-thinking its plan to airlift up to 20,000 refugees to Cuba.
Instead, they may house refugees on the U.S. mainland, or put more
money into providing shelter for refugees in Albania and Macedonia.
And that pleases people like Joyce Feilke, a school counselor in
Austin, Texas who lived at Gitmo for two years. She said ``we could
house the refugees better at a campsite in Austin than we could at
Guantanamo Bay. That place is enough to drive anyone crazy.''

   OLY-CONGRESS _ After a brief reprieve, the IOC bribery scandal
is heating up again, this time in the halls of Congress. A

status in the U.S., limit the amount of Olympic fees sponsors could
deduct and place U.S. TV rights fees _ the single biggest source of
Olympic income _ with the USOC instead of the IOC. The White House
was asked almost a month ago by the U.S. Olympic Committee to
include the IOC under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and an
answer is possible Tuesday. And the Justice Department and the FBI
also are investigating possible violations of federal fraud and tax
laws. (Turner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 40.

system, where jury-rigged hookups are commonplace. In February
President Ernesto Zedillo proposed privatizing much of this
state-run industry, hoping to bring in millions of private
investment to make it more efficient and expand its capacity.
Zedillo has run into lots of opposition, though. The privatization
of banks and highways has led to some disasters, making
privatization a dirty word in Mexico. (Ferriss, Cox News Service)

for every one of you.'' The scene was classic Faulkner: direct,
low-key, no-frills. In his first year heading the nation's largest
university, Faulkner is getting grades from A plus to incomplete.
Since taking office last April 13, Faulkner has faced ongoing
protests from staff over their pay, an overnight takeover of the
Main Building by angry students and the skepticism of
high-technology executives he wants badly to woo. We give readers a
sense of the job he is doing. (Roser, Austin American-Statesman).

students are taught by teachers who lack proper credentials. And
nobody is required to tell their parents, many of whom have no idea
the problem is so pervasive. Educators have downplayed the problem
but an increasing body of evidence indicates that unqualified
teachers could be the driving force behind poor educational
performance. University of Texas data from the 1996-97 school year
shows that students with properly certified teachers pass the TAAS
at higher rates than their peers with uncertified teachers. The
study also shows that the most affluent schools are more likely to
have properly certified teachers. Uncertified teachers are most
abundant in bilingual education, English as a Second Language and
computer sciences _ three key educational areas in a state that's
increasingly Hispanic and increasingly computerized. (Brooks,

Zedillo has run into lots of opposition, though. The privatization

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Arlene Gibson, headmistress at the Spence School, a
private girls school on Manhattan's Upper East Side, remembers the
bad old days, the early '90s, when girls' schools had to convince
parents of the benefits of single-sex education.
</P>
<P>
   ``One used to have to make the case, especially to fathers, for
why girls' schools,'' she said. ``You don't have to do that
anymore. There is a sense now that they know the issue of girls and
computers, they know the research on who talks in class, there's a
general awareness.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it has gone well beyond awareness, into a kind of
frenzy, for Manhattan's seven private girls' schools: Most had 10
applications for every $17,000-plus kindergarten opening for this
coming fall, more than the average for New York's private schools.
And the only public girls' school in New York City, the 3-year-old
Young Women's Leadership School in Harlem, has also been deluged
with applications.
</P>
<P>
   But the gender research and attention to girls' special needs
that have spurred increasing interest in girls' schools are also
reshaping the coeducational private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Although coed schools defend themselves as being more in step
with the modern world and say they represent the most basic
diversity in education, over the last few years, most of the city's
private coed schools have made explicit efforts to ensure that
girls will not be overshadowed.
</P>
<P>
   Many have started gender-equity committees and projects
reconsidering everything from the boys-chase-the-girls game at
recess to who controls the mouse during computer time _ and who
supervises the computer lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've videotaped teachers at different levels to see if there
are unconscious biases,'' said Elisabeth Krents, the admissions
director at Dalton. ``We've analyzed leadership roles to see if
they're divided among girls and boys. We don't say, `OK, boys into
the dress-up corner, girls into the block area,' but we build it
into everything we do. In second-grade, right now, they're studying
Grimms' fairy tales, analyzing the gender stereotypes.''
</P>
<P>
   Applications at Manhattan's private girls' schools have
increased 69 percent since 1991, according to the National
Coalition of Girls' Schools, with many applicants coming from
beyond the traditional Upper East Side milieu. Nationally, the
coalition said, applications at girls' schools are also rising,
though at less than half the rate of the Manhattan schools. But no
other city has anything like the number of single-sex options that
Manhattan offers.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the interest in single-sex schools has grown out of the
publicity following the American Association of University Women's
1992 research review, ``How Schools Shortchange Girls,'' which
concluded that girls face constant bias from kindergarten through
high school.
</P>
<P>
   And the coalition of girls' schools, founded a year earlier, has
touted the benefits of schools where girls get, as they put it,
``not just equal opportunity, but every opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The writings of people like Carol Gilligan and Mary Pipher, too,
promoted the idea that girls entering adolescence often lose
confidence in themselves and begin to falter in self-esteem and
fall behind in math, science and computer classes.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, a crop of new books on boys' emotional and
developmental needs has spurred interest in boys' schools as well,
though that is just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent research shows that boys and girls both thrive
in good coed schools. But with everyone from politicians to
educators stressing higher educational standards and back-to-basics
learning, the rigor and traditional style of girls' schools _ and
those plaid or pleated uniforms that so many public schools are now
also adopting _ seem not impossibly old-fashioned but right in tune
with the times.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many parents have concluded that single-sex
schooling will help ensure that their daughters have room to shine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't want to ruin my daughter's feistiness,'' said
Marion Markham Abood, an Upper West Side mother whose daughter is
in kindergarten at Nightingale-Bamford. ``I didn't want to chance
that her spirit would be quashed in any way at a coed school. If
she wants to be president of the country, who am I to ruin her
chance by having her overshadowed by some boy?''
</P>
<P>
   Preschool directors far from the Upper East Side have been
especially struck by the widening circle of applicants to girls'
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of our parents used to consider single-sex schools, but
there's been a significant shift in the past five or six years,''
said Sheila Wolper, the director of Beginnings, a nursery school
that sends about 35 children off to kindergarten each year.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that coed private schools are lacking for
applicants. They, too, have had a banner year, in what has become
an increasingly anxious admissions season, echoing the college
scene.
</P>
<P>
   While parents and admissions directors alike seem to believe
that kindergarten competition is getting more intense, the schools
will not release admission statistics, so it is difficult to assess
how much is reality and how much is nervous parents' applying to
more kindergartens than they used to _ sometimes upward of 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Educational Records Bureau, which tests children applying to
private New York kindergartens, said the number tested rose nearly
25 percent from 1990 to 1996, but has been relatively consistent,
about 1,970, for the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   But over the last four years, interest in the Manhattan girls'
schools has grown so strongly that several were forced to add new
kindergarten sections when an unexpectedly large proportion of
students who were offered places actually accepted them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing more parents who might not have gone to
independent schools themselves, but who feel that girls' schools
promote a can-do attitude,'' said Concepcion Alvar, the admissions
director at Marymount School, which, like several other girls'
schools, sent out fewer acceptances this year than in the past,
took no one from the waiting list, and still ended up with a larger
kindergarten than they had planned for the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of the gender research deals with preadolescents
and older children, the girls' schools say that all-girls' classes
can be an advantage even for kindergartners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who has to wait while the boys get settled? The girls,'' said
Barbara Root, the admissions director at Convent of the Sacred
Heart. ``Whose time is not always used as well as it might be? Who
can do more in a group where no one's thinking about throwing
blocks?''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   But administrators and teachers in coed schools are frustrated
that so many parents are ignoring the benefits of mixing boys and
girls _ and that many of them are actually misreading the gender
research.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look closely, all the research the AAUW reports is that
the best environment for girls is a cooperative, informal one where
children work in groups and collaborate, a place like ours,'' said
John Dexter, the head of the coed Trevor Day School. ``Most girls'
schools are formal, with uniforms, single individual desks and
frontal teaching, with the teacher standing up front and talking.
But we suffer, because people that might have come here are going
to single-sex schools, seeing that as preferable.''
</P>
<P>
   He and others point out that the research does not say that boys
and girls tend to learn differently and therefore should be
separated, but rather that boys and girls learn differently so
teachers should use approaches that work for both.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in a report issued last year _ ``Separated by Sex: A
Critical Look at Single Sex Education for Girls'' _ the American
Association of University Women concluded that boys and girls alike
flourish in good coeducational schools, and that while many girls
prefer single-sex math and science classes, there is no evidence
that they do better in them.
</P>
<P>
   But while coeducation remains the paradigm of American
education, those who believe in teaching boys and girls together
are now having to make their case to parents.
</P>
<P>
   One girls' school headmistress, laughing, pulled out the
brochure for a conference, ``Coeducation: The best we can do for
our children?'' to be held in May at Phillips Academy in Andover,
Mass., a prestigious coed boarding school.
</P>
<P>
   ``While researchers have cited advantages to educating the sexes
separately, coeducation and its underlying assumptions have gone
virtually unexamined,'' the brochure says, promising that those who
attend the conference will come away able to ``articulate a theory
or philosophy that guides coeducational schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Some parents shopping for schools this year said they felt that
the coed schools did not articulate a real philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't have a compelling answer to why coed,'' said Molly
McEneny, who will send her daughter, Catherine, to a girls' school
for kindergarten next September. ``All they could say was `It's a
coed world.' I think girls' schools can teach to girls in a very
concentrated way at the younger ages, teaching the way girls learn
best. And at the older ages, girls get every opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The coed schools say that with careful attention they can, and
do, give girls every opportunity and are even more vigilant these
days about promoting equity between boys and girls.
</P>
<P>
   Both Dalton and Ethical Culture, for example, brought in a
consultant, Catherine Krupnick, a lecturer at the Harvard Graduate
School of Education, who had videotaped classes at Harvard. She had
studied who talked and for how long, and found that boys dominated
discussion except where there was a female instructor and a
predominantly female class.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's Harvard or preschool, boys have a quicker
reaction time, and the first hand up will usually be a boy's,'' she
said. ``If you want to give more people a chance to participate,
you need to create some waiting time, and not call on that first
hand.''
</P>
<P>
   At Ethical, with Ms. Krupnick's guidance, teachers did extensive
videotape analysis of each kindergarten and prekindergarten class.
Much of what they found _ that boys spent more time in the block
area than girls, for example _ confirmed what they already knew.
</P>
<P>
   But the tapes also showed more subtle and surprising
differences. For example, one teacher who gave the children a math
problem and then went around the circle asking for answers noticed
that she allowed girls who demurred to pass immediately, but when a
boy wanted to pass, she would ask, ``Are you sure?'' before moving
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also saw that where a big group of very verbal boys sat
together, the teacher would orient her body language toward them,''
said Sara Adler, the principal of the lower grades at Ethical
Culture. ``Cultural biases become pervasive in your practice if you
don't keep tabs on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing what they were doing, Ms. Adler said, led teachers to
change their practices. ``When it's time to sit down for a meeting,
the teacher might say, `Today we're going to have a pattern: two
boys, then two girls,''' she said. ``We put children in
mixed-gender groups and say, `Today's your group's day with the
blocks.'''
</P>
<P>
   Other coed schools took different actions to promote gender
equity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked very hard for a woman who coordinates our
computers,'' said Dexter of Trevor Day. ``It's no accident that
four out of five math teachers here are women.''
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan Country School, which is coed, trained its teachers to
give gender the same explicit attention as race. ``We noticed that
we had been letting sexual and homosexual epithets pass, which we
would never do for racial epithets, so we stopped that,'' said
Michele Sola, the director.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is not only to encourage girls to pursue
activities traditionally associated with boys, Ms. Sola said, but
to get boys to appreciate activities that girls tend to favor.
</P>
<P>
   It even came down to re-engineering boys-chase-the-girls: ``We
talked with the 4- and 5-year-olds about the feelings of always
being the chaser or always chased, about changing the rules so that
there can be mixed-gender groups, and a teacher intervening in the
middle, to announce that the chasers will now be chased,'' Ms. Sola
said. ``We really believe in equity.''
</P>
<P>
   All well and good, the single-sex schools say, but the girls'
schools, where every day is girls' block day, send a powerful
message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember one little 5-year-old,'' said Edes Gilbert, the
former headmistress at Spence, ``standing in the middle of the room
in her new uniform, who looked around on the first day of the
school and said: `Thank God! No boys in the block corner!'''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Snow will blanket the mountains of Southern California on Sunday
as a cold upper-level low pressure system arrives from the Pacific
Ocean. Meanwhile, a chilly rain will dampen coastal regions, where
1/2 inch of precipitation could fall near Los Angeles and San Diego
by evening. A few rumbles of thunder may accompany the rain as the
chilly air arriving at high altitudes renders the atmosphere
increasingly unstable.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, offshore breezes will direct dry air toward the
Northwest Coast, providing much of Washington and Oregon with
mostly sunny skies and mild conditions. The remainder of the West,
including the Rockies, will stay mainly dry as ample sunshine
covers the region.
</P>
<P>
   High-altitude moisture streaming northeast from Mexico will
bring patches of high cirrus clouds to Texas and the Southeast on
Sunday. The only impact from these clouds will be to dim the sun at
times since the lower portions of the atmosphere will be too dry to
support any rain. Farther south, Florida will remain generally
sunny and very warm with a few locations surpassing 90 degrees over
the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Moisture attendant to a team of low pressure systems will spread
a cold rain over the eastern Great Lakes and northern Middle
Atlantic States. Cold air filtering south from Ontario will cause
the rain to mix with snow along the northern shield of the
precipitation in northern Michigan and over northern sections of
the upper Middle West. Elsewhere, a narrow wedge of dry air will
promote sunny and cool conditions in central New England. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Tornado Damage &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Experts have been surveying damage caused by recent storms in
the Middle West to confirm the areas where tornadoes were to blame.
When twisters are large and witnessed by many people, the job is
easy. In other cases, people sometimes confuse benign, pendulous
clouds with tornadoes. Moreover, damage thought to be caused by a
tornado is often the result of straight-line winds generated when
downdrafts in thunderstorms spread out rapidly after hitting the
ground. Experts look for spiral patterns in damaged trees and
buildings, strong evidence of the swirling winds of a twister. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The court fight over New York's share of the
national tobacco settlement _ a battle primarily between Gov.
George Pataki and New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani _ threatens
to delay distribution of the money for all 46 of the states
involved, lawyers and advocates involved in the settlement say.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, the major tobacco companies agreed last
year to pay the states $206 billion over 25 years to cover the
costs of treating tobacco-related illness. But no money can flow
until most of the states, as defined by a mathematical formula,
have had their plans for distributing the money approved by the
state courts to avoid legal challenges.
</P>
<P>
   California's plan is widely seen as likely to be held up for
some time, making New York's role all the more important. And as
long as both New York's and California's plans are uncertain, it is
impossible to reach the mathematical threshold for releasing the
money.
</P>
<P>
   Most states have completed their plans, and several others are
expected to do so soon. People who have followed the settlement say
it is possible _ even likely _ that by later this spring, so many
states will be on board that New York could put them over the top.
Once the formula targets are reached, the first payments to the
states will be made immediately, but if they are not reached, the
first payments will be made on June 30, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York has probably become the key, the difference between
getting there soon and waiting more than a year,'' said Peter
Fisher, manager for state issues at the Campaign for Tobacco-Free
Kids, a group based in Washington that tracks the progress of the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia's legislature has already allocated its first-year
installment of the tobacco money, and Fisher said several other
states are expected to follow suit as they approve their 1999-2000
budgets. Many states have made at least tentative plans to use the
money to ease the burden of financing health care, to start new
smoking-prevention and education programs, or to pay for wholly
unrelated projects, all of which may have to be postponed for a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Some governments, including those of New York City and Nassau
County, N.Y., have talked of selling bonds against the expected
stream of revenue, an idea that now faces delay until next year.
</P>
<P>
   New York Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer, who is a central
figure in the lawsuit, said, ``I think the soonest we could get a
resolution in the courts is in about six months, and it could be
substantially longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of smoking and officials in other states stress that
if the city and the state have a legitimate disagreement, they have
every right to pursue it to its conclusion. But for Pataki and
Giuliani, a pair of Republicans with a long-running feud, the
dispute threatens to fix blame on them for delaying delivery of the
money, just as they are trying to raise their standings nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   When the settlement was reached last year with the attorneys
general of the states, Dennis C. Vacco, New York's attorney general
at the time, decided that the state would keep 51 percent of New
York's $25 billion allocation, with 49 percent divided among New
York City and the counties outside the city. New York City would
receive $6.7 billion under this formula.

<P>
   Giuliani contends that the city is shortchanged under this plan,
and at his direction the city has sued to challenge it. Westchester
and Erie counties are also plaintiffs in the suit, but their
complaints are different from the city's and, lawyers in the
attorney general's office say, more easily resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The city has raised three main arguments against the state's
formula for distributing the money: that it is partly based on
population, which does not reflect the actual health costs caused
by smoking; that it omits the smoking-related costs of health
coverage for government workers, retirees and their families; and
that it is based on incorrect figures for Medicaid costs.
</P>
<P>
   Vacco's lawyers contended that the formula was correct, and that
other states had used population in their allocations. And in a
ruling in December that the city has appealed, a state Supreme
Court justice accepted the state's formula as fair and said that
the city's share compared favorably with what it would receive in
other states.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki supports the plan, but its original sponsor, Vacco, a
Republican, is gone, having lost the election to Spitzer, a
Democrat, in November. Spitzer, with nothing invested in any side
of the dispute, is trying to negotiate a settlement between the
governor and the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Spitzer's office and opponents of smoking, speaking
on the condition of anonymity, contend that the governor is
intentionally stalling a possible settlement. They say he does not
want the state's first installment of the tobacco money, more than
$800 million, delivered this year, for fear it would become a part
of the current budget negotiations and would encourage the state
Legislature to spend more while Pataki is trying to restrain
spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pataki's dilemma is he wants to delay, but he can't be seen as
delaying without making a lot of people in other states angry,''
one Spitzer aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael McKeon, Pataki's press secretary, said: ``That's just
wild speculation. The bottom line is, we're ready to move forward.
We're not the ones pressing the case; the mayor is.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The governor has proposed using a large portion of the tobacco
money to reduce the state's debt, but he has not proposed a major
increase in the state's anti-smoking programs _ an increase
recommended last year by a Department of Health advisory panel.
That decision has earned him criticism from groups that oppose
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it raises serious questions as to the governor's
commitment to taking on the tobacco menace when he has rejected a
plan put out by the health advisers, and now it appears he's
dragging his feet on even getting the money,'' said Blair Horner,
legislative director of the New York Public Interest Research
Group, who was a member of the advisory panel.
</P>
<P>
   There are political risks for Giuliani in the dispute, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the city's position was that the money it was
seeking should be taken from the state's share of the money. But in
its latest court filings, the city seeks a thorough overhaul of the
distribution plan that would mean less money for many rural
counties. That is a potentially risky position for Giuliani, who
may be about to make his first bid for statewide office, the U.S.
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   McKeon said the governor and his staff were aware ``that there
could be implications beyond New York'' in the city's suit, but he
played them down. Pataki, in discussing the state budget, has said
several times this year that there was no way the money could be
delivered this year, a position disputed by some of the lawyers who
negotiated the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Lorna Bade Goodman, senior litigator in the City Corporation
Counsel's office, said the city was eager to end the dispute
through negotiations with the governor's office. ``Let's be fair:
it's not just us holding the money up,'' she said. ``There are
other states, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the tobacco deal, before any of the money can be paid, 80
percent of the main parties to the settlement (46 states, the
District of Columbia and Puerto Rico), accounting for 80 percent of
the money, must have final approval from their own state courts.
(Four other states _ Texas, Minnesota, Florida and Mississippi _
reached separate settlements in their own tobacco lawsuits.)
</P>
<P>
   The first threshold, approval by 80 percent, or 39 parties, has
nearly been reached. Thirty-seven have received final approval,
while four others face no legal challenges but are waiting until
they have passed a deadline for mounting such a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Those 41 plaintiffs account for 60 percent of the money.
</P>
<P>
   California and New York each account for almost 13 percent of
the money, so the 80 percent mark cannot be reached with both
states outstanding. California's situation is odd, in that the
attorney general's office there considers that the state has won
final approval, despite some outstanding appeals, which the office
considers peripheral to the case.
</P>
<P>
   But both the National Association of Attorneys General and, more
important, the tobacco industry, see the appeals as an obstacle and
consider California to be one of the states outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   There are pending challenges in five other states that together
would get 14 percent of the money. By far the largest are
Pennsylvania and New Jersey, which account for almost 10 percent of
the total, but opponents of smoking say they do not expect either
of those challenges to be much of an obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``California and New York are the real problem,'' said Fred
Olson, an aide to Attorney General Christine Gregoire of Washington
state, who played a leading role in the case. ``If California's
held up, then New York becomes the linchpin.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the past eight years, Knicks Ernie Grunfeld has
left other general managers envious while he dips into the league's
largest revenue pool with a crane's scoop. But after seasons of
using cash piles to facilitate trades and patch up mistakes,
Grunfeld has helped turn an organization that once contended for a
title into a money pit.
</P>
<P>
   After spending $68.6 million on this year's team _ a payroll
that doubles the league average _ Grunfeld has collected a
hodgepodge of talents to revolve around an aging superstar
incapable of carrying the team on a nightly basis. Often choosing a
player's cache over chemistry, Grunfeld's decision-making is partly
responsible for a situation that has left the Knicks in a desperate
scramble to make the playoffs and provide some return on a payroll
that one Eastern Conference official called ``fiscal negligence.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Knicks can salvage their season with a playoff run
starting with Sunday's game against the Nets, members of the
organization say Grunfeld's history of disingenuous relationships
with players and his meddlesome approach toward coach Jeff Van
Gundy has left him only thin insulation from being fired. While
core players like Patrick Ewing, Allan Houston and Larry Johnson
have rallied around Van Gundy, Grunfeld's management style has been
questioned by current players and former Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tells you something when the general manager could be fired
and the coach could survive,'' said one member of the organization,
who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``Usually, it's the other
way around.''
</P>
<P>
   To those within the organization, Grunfeld has made his position
more precarious by creating a mistrust between himself and the
players and coaches, a rift that manifested itself March 14. Just
hours before tipoff, NBC aired a report citing sources saying Van
Gundy could be fired if the team lost to Charlotte that day.
Grunfeld called the report ``ridiculous.'' But Van Gundy reacted as
if he believed the report was true and showed how hollow he felt
Grunfeld's support was.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of the organization felt it was Grunfeld who
leaked Van Gundy's precarious job status in order to deflect
attention from himself. ``I resent any implication of any kind,''
said Grunfeld on Friday. ``If someone has something to say, they
should come and say it to me. But that's absolute bull.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue ruffled players, who wondered privately if Grunfeld
was trying to undermine Van Gundy. In the larger picture, the
situation is just part of a rift that has been growing between the
players and a team president they don't trust. Although no current
Knicks would comment publicly, several criticized Grunfeld off the
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're seeing a bad situation that has been created by
losing,'' said Madison Square Garden president Dave Checketts. ``I
see a team that is losing more than they should. And that creates
everything you're talking about. People say, `Well, why is this?
Where does it come from? Is it the mix of talent? Is it practice
time? Are they too small to compete in the half-court East without
Charles Oakley? Is there a rift between players and management?' I
think it may be a combination of a whole host of factors. I don't
think any lack of trust or any rift is at the heart of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning tends to heal uneasiness and promote job security. These
are uneasy times for the Knicks. Even under the umbrella of an
ownership as wealthy as Charles Dolan's CableVision, Grunfeld and
Checketts will have to answer for a payroll that has thus far
produced a 19-17 team that is in danger of missing the playoffs for
the first time in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``For what we've invested, the results have been
disappointing,'' Checketts said. ``When the Knicks were in the NBA
finals, we were at $26 million on our payroll. So, yes, we've spent
a lot. I understand that. It hasn't worked out, and the
responsibility comes back to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Checketts will decide whether Grunfeld comes back
next year. Grunfeld, an affable personality who is close to
Checketts, said he fully expects to return. Others wonder how he
can escape his mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ernie has tried to build a team to challenge other teams _
like the Heat and the Pacers _ instead of putting good quality
people on the floor who complemented each other,'' said the former
Knick Buck Williams. ``When I first came, Ernie told me he wanted
to win with veteran players. They traded John Wallace, Walter
McCarty and John Thomas because they were committed to the
veterans. Then a shift in philosophy came. They dealt Charles
Oakley, and discounted chemistry. Oak sacrificed to make the team
better, and he helped make Patrick's life easier. And I'd say with
Patrick, why get younger until he retires?''
</P>
<P>
   Oakley was traded to Toronto in June for the young and athletic
Marcus Camby. Then, Grunfeld worked behind the scenes to prod the
coach into giving the third-year pro more playing time so Grunfeld
could justify the six-year, $48 million extension he gave Camby in
mid March.
</P>
<P>
   ``Camby is just another in a long list of players they've
overpaid to keep,'' one Eastern Conference official said. ``They've
been able to buy their way out of problems for years, and it's
going to catch up to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there are general managers who envy the Knicks'
seemingly unlimited funds. ``It'd be so much easier to build a club
and not worry about the bottom line,'' said Rick Sund, the Pistons'
vice president of basketball operations.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Grunfeld has paid and paid, costs which ultimately trickle down
to ticket holders who pay the highest prices in the league. When
the Knicks needed an insurance policy for Ewing, they re-signed
Chris Dudley to a $28 million deal that left other general managers
sniggering. When it looked as if Miami's Pat Riley _ who has
appeared to bait the Knicks into making several moves _ was going
to swoop down and sign Chris Childs in 1996, the Knicks forked over
$24 million for six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were bidding against Miami,'' Grunfeld explained. ``When
you're in a free-agent situation, sometimes you have to overpay.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Childs' deal allowed Charlie Ward to demand a
five-year, $27 million contract because he had supplanted Childs as
the starter. Over $50 million later, the Knicks still need a point
guard and tried unsuccessfully to land Stephon Marbury with an
offer of Allan Houston or Latrell Sprewell, along with Childs.
</P>
<P>
   Packed with high salaried players, the Knicks are viewed as a
team with locked-in pieces, although Grunfeld feels confident he
can make moves. ``They may have a couple of parts,'' one general
manager said. ``But it's not going to be easy to convince a team to
take Sprewell with his track record. It's hard to validate the
risk. The Knicks take risks other teams won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Risk is something general managers live with everyday. And most
don't have the assets the Knicks do. Sund is one of many general
managers finding success despite a tighter budget. The Pistons
payroll is close to $32 million and yet they have a 22-14 record
and are pushing the Pacers for the Central Division title. The
Orlando Magic, with a payroll of $40 million, has been able to
survive Shaquille O'Neal's departure and become contenders again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, more than ever, there is an eye on making the right
strategic moves with the right talent,'' said John Gabriel, the
Magic's general manager. ``That's part of why we're pretty good
today. We've stuck with the team instead of turning to every free
agent with new contracts.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Grunfeld has shaken up his core group this year, a
strategy that has been open to debate. Nothing was more rattling
than the Oakley trade. In the aftermath of that deal, Grunfeld was
criticized and, at times, has responded in ways considered petty.
Upon Oakley's return to the Garden for the first time since the
trade, for instance, Grunfeld decided to air a tribute to Oakley at
halftime instead of before the game. Never a defender of
Grunfeld's, Oakley said the whole situation was embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we had done that differently,'' Checketts said. ``You
have to put yourself in the place of a general manager, who, on the
one hand, would like to acknowledge the contributions of a player,
and on the other hand, does not want to spend so much time that it
detracts from the job at hand. And that's to go out and win a game.
It's not an easy situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Traded players rarely praise management. But an unusually high
number of former Knicks have little regard for Grunfeld, like
Oakley, Derek Harper and Anthony Mason. Through them, Grunfeld is
portrayed as a bungling general manager who asked for their input
but cut them off in mid-sentence when it wasn't what he wanted to
hear.
</P>
<P>
   What becomes of Grunfeld's tenure isn't clear. Checketts said
he'll evaluate everyone at the end of the season, but has shown no
public indication that he is displeased with Grunfeld's
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone out and got the players we thought could succeed,''
he said. ``We've had quite a run.
</P>
<P>
   ``The summer of `96, Ernie traded and got Larry Johnson and
Allan Houston and Chris Childs, they were all solid moves,''
Checketts said. ``Since that time, we've picked up Kurt Thomas as a
free agent, then traded for Sprewell and for Camby. At the time, we
thought they'd all work out very well. At this point, we have to
conclude they haven't worked out very well. But I'd say Ernie's job
performance has been very, very good.''

SPORTS COLUMN: CHANGES FOR A BETTER MASTERS FINISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ If the Masters really begins on the back nine on
Sunday, as so many here like to say, it will be an even more
difficult back nine this Sunday, particularly and possibly
poignantly because of changes on two of the four finishing holes.
</P>
<P>
   With 20 new loblolly pine trees resembling a line of sentries to
the right of the fairway on the 500-yard 15th; with the Eisenhower
Tree again creating a guardhouse to check the tee shots on the
17th, which has been lengthened to 425 yards, and with a subtle
touch of rough off every fairway, the leaders will have to do what
golfers would rather not do. Think.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 17th is going to be one of the great finishing holes
now,'' said Raymond Floyd, the 1976 winner. ``Instead of the very
birdieable-type hole it was with players' length today.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Masters' second-most-difficult hole through the first two
rounds, with a 4.307-stroke average, the 17th yielded only 12
birdies, far off the pace of the 39 birdies there last year when
Mark O'Meara birdied both the 17th and the 18th holes to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hate to play that 17th hole with the wind we had in the
first round,'' Colin Montgomerie said. ``When they put the pin on
the front over the bunker, it gets very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the final round, the flagstick usually is where
Montgomerie described it _ on the front of the green behind the
bunker guarding the green. In other years, most pros were hitting a
wedge or a 9-iron. Now it's a 7-iron, unless their tee shot has
clunked into the Eisenhower Tree, as David Duval's did Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But the 15th should continue as the most perilous of Augusta
National's finishing holes, primarily because of the ponds in front
and behind the green where the hopes of Masters leaders often
drown. And with those new trees, the rough and no more mounds in
the fairway, the leaders won't be whaling away on the tee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best change to the course was what they did to the 15th
fairway,'' said Nick Price, alluding to the removal of the mounds.
``Now you have to hit an excellent tee shot to have a reasonable
chance for the green.''
</P>
<P>
   Those mounds acted like slingshots for tee shots, adding
anywhere from 20 to 40 yards. But without those mounds _ and
fearing both the the trees on the right and the rough, even at only
one and three-eighths inches _ it's a different mind set for the
big hitters. From that rough, they can't be sure of holding the
green.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big change,'' Scott McCarron said. ``I used to hit up
on that hill and kick it back to the fairway. In the first round I
was trying to hit a 3-iron to the green and that's a club or two
different than it was for me in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   In other final rounds, an eagle 3 at the 15th has sometimes
defined the winner, notably Jack Nicklaus in 1986. But halfway
through this Masters, there was only one eagle there, by Frank
Lickliter. With balls spinning back into the pond or skipping into
the pond beyond, that slippery 15th green has usually created more
problems than it solved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like what they did at the 11th with the new green,'' Price
said, alluding to the Masters officials, ``and they might want to
start thinking about doing something to the 15th green. Once the
ball starts spinning there, it could come back 25 feet and go in
the water. You're not safe with a sand wedge or a pitching wedge or
a lob wedge.''
</P>
<P>
   Through two rounds, the 11th hole, with a new, treacherous
back-left pin position available Sunday on its rebuilt green, has
emerged as the sixth-most-difficult hole, up from ninth last year.
</P>
<P>
   On this year's other altered hole, the second, where a new back
tee has stretched the downhill dogleg left to 575 yards, the pros
must think, too. Even a big hitter like McCarron, who had a par-5
there in each of the first two rounds. In previous years, he
invariably went for the green in two.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, I'd take a driver and try to get it over the bunker
and get it down there, then hit a 5-iron or a 6-iron,'' McCarron
said. ``Now I'm trying to hit a 3-wood short of that big bunker on
the right, then hit another 3-wood up near the green. So it's a
three-shot hole.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 15th, where Gene Sarazen's double-eagle 2 put the
Masters on the map in 1935, is also a three-shot hole because of
its new trees to the right, its rough and the absence of the
mounds. And it's where the Masters could turn Sunday, as it so
often has in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at the people around that 15th green,'' Nick Price said
with a laugh, ``and I think, man, these people must like to see us
really battle here.''

10 TOP LINEMEN COULD GO IN THE FIRST 2 ROUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York Giants general manager Ernie Accorsi looks at the group
of offensive linemen in next week's National Football League draft
and sometimes he can't believe his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is pretty impressive,'' Accorsi said. ``I can't say the
last time we had this many good offensive linemen. I can say this
group would be hard to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   It is such a good bunch, that as many as 10 top offensive
linemen could go in the first two rounds, most of them tackles and
many capable of stepping into a starting lineup soon.
</P>
<P>
   Many assume the Giants will take a tackle or a guard. The Giants
select 19th over all and, though a lineman is a priority, the
Giants' system still calls for the team to take the best player on
their draft board, even if it is a quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   But the Giants have apparently changed that philosophy by making
subtle changes in the way they approach the draft. They may lean
more toward their needs instead of stubbornly sticking to their
formula of drafting the best-rated player. Still, if the Giants
passed up a good lineman it would be like Jay Leno passing up a
good joke.
</P>
<P>
   Some scouts believe the best college tackle is probably John
Tait, a 6-foot-6-inch, 310-pound mountain at Brigham Young. Some
scouts love his maturity as a 24-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   There is little chance Tait will still be around by the time the
Giants pick, especially since the Chicago Bears, the Arizona
Cardinals and the Detroit Lions are all looking hard at him and
pick in the top 10. That means the Giants will have to settle for
the next tier, players like L.J. Shelton from Eastern Michigan,
Aaron Gibson from Wisconsin and Jon Jansen from Michigan. Given the
Giants' fondness for Big 10 players, Jansen or Gibson are likely
choices.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton weighs 341 pounds, Jansen was nicknamed the rock and
Gibson can bench-press 485 pounds. Not a bad group.
</P>
<P>
   The best guard is probably Doug Brzezinski from Boston College.
At 6-3, 309 pounds, he is a solid player, but scouts question
whether he can block quick defensive tackles.
</P>
<P>
   A Background Check
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Dolphins are seriously considering drafting the
troubled running back Cecil Collins. Coach Jimmy Johnson has sent
scouts and other team officials to both of Collins' former
campuses, first at McNeese State, where he played last year and
then at Louisiana State.
</P>
<P>
   There is little question that Collins is the most athletically
gifted back in the country. He is a solid 210 pounds and can run
the 40-yard dash in 4.4 seconds. He should be a guaranteed top-10
pick.
</P>
<P>
   But Collins has had problems off the field. He was arrested
following the 1997 season on a charge of breaking into a woman's
apartment. Then, at McNeese State, he tested positive for
marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins are of course cautious, which is why they are
interviewing almost anyone connected with Collins' life and
checking court records to get a complete picture. Johnson believes,
at least for now, that he can work with Collins and keep him out of
trouble. Johnson also signed Lawrence Phillips, another running
back with a history of arrests, in 1997, only to cut him eight
months later.
</P>
<P>
   Salary-Cap Concerns
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Cowboys are not the only team being looked at by the
National Football League for possible salary-cap violations. The
league has other investigations underway, though it is unclear
which teams are being scrutinized.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, several teams complained to the NFL regarding the
situation of three potential Dallas players. Some teams believe the
Cowboys have reached some form of agreement with center Mark
Stepnoski, wide receiver Raghib Ismail and linebacker Quentin
Coryatt. Once a signed agreement is reached, the contract must be
turned into the league office within 24 hours. The teams believe
the Cowboys are not turning in those three contracts because those
deals would put Dallas over the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   What the Cowboys may be trying is not new, but in recent years
the NFL has seriously tried to crack down on such practices. If
teams can simply sign a player and report it to the league whenever
it chooses, then the salary cap means nothing.
</P>
<P>
   According to team executives, the Kansas City Chiefs and San
Francisco 49ers have been previously warned about such practices
after other teams turned them in. It is common for individual clubs
to police themselves.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jason Grimsley, a relief pitcher in his first season
with the New York Yankees, was among those who flocked to see the
movie ``Mission: Impossible'' in 1996, and as he watched Tom Cruise
and an accomplice crawl through an air duct to steal secret
information, memories of Grimsley's own impossible mission came
back to him.
</P>
<P>
   Grimsley didn't steal government secrets, but he was at the
center of a heist that is part of baseball lore for its audacity
and ingenuity. For the first time, Grimsley acknowledged last week
that it was he who crawled through the innards of the Chicago's
Comiskey Park into the umpires' dressing room on July 15, 1994, to
exchange an illegally corked bat of his Cleveland Indians teammate
Albert Belle for one that was cork-free.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the biggest adrenaline rushes I've ever
experienced,'' Grimsley said in telling a tale known to others but
never addressed by himself.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians were in a playoff race with the White Sox as they
played in Chicago, and Belle, the Indians' left fielder, was
obliterating American League pitching _ when the season was ended
by a strike on Aug. 12, he had a .357 average and 36 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's manager, Gene Lamont, had been tipped off that Belle
might have hollowed out the barrel of his bat and filled it with
cork, which makes the head of the bat lighter, increasing the speed
of the swing. As is the prerogative of any manager, Lamont
challenged the legality of Belle's bat in the first inning, a
process that automatically prompted an umpire, Dave Phillips, to
take the bat and lock it in the umpires' dressing room for later
examination.
</P>
<P>
   As the bat was removed from the field, the Cleveland dugout was
seized with concern. Belle's teammates knew it contained the
illegal substance, and once that was discovered, their best hitter
would certainly be suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Grimsley, who was one of the Indians' starting pitchers but was
not working that night, said, ``As I was sitting there, the thought
came to my mind: I can get that bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Grimsley said he knew that the clubhouse contained a false
ceiling, with removable square tiles, and he surmised that the
umpires' dressing room, situated on the same level, must have had
the same kind of ceiling. Grimsley walked back toward the clubhouse
and down a hallway to do some reconnaissance _ he noted the
whereabouts of the umpires' room, and the cement-block walls that
framed the rooms.
</P>
<P>
   If he climbed above the ceiling, Grimsley figured, he could
crawl atop the cement-block walls and work his way from the
Indians' clubhouse to the umpires' room. He estimated the distance
between the clubhouse and the umpires' room to be at least 100
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Grimsley, who was born and reared in Cleveland, Texas, is 6 feet
3 inches and 180 pounds. He had never done this sort of thing
before, but he had never been afraid of adventure. He climbed trees
aggressively as a child and loved to ride his bicycle and his
motorcycle over jumps. When he was 12, he ran a motorcycle over a
stump and lost his big left toe.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was like a puzzle to be solved,'' he said. ``It's like
the game we play _ this was a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Grimsley, who said he was the primary operative but was aided by
another member of the organization who was not a player, procured a
yellow flashlight and a cork-free bat, then climbed onto the desk
in the office of Manager Mike Hargrove, removed a ceiling tile and
climbed on top of the cement-block wall.
</P>
<P>
   The wall Grimsley had to balance on was about 18 inches wide. A
slip and he would fall through the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Grimsley aimed his flashlight and located a wall at which he
knew he would have to turn. Some light seeped through the tile
cracks, but it was dark, and very hot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty hairy up there,'' said Grimsley, whose journey
was complicated by piping that hung from wires and crossed the
cement-block walls. Grimsley and his accomplice had to move slowly
and carefully over the pipes, lest they rupture them and destroy
the operation. Grimsley estimated that it took them 35 to 40
minutes to traverse the distance to where they guessed the umpires'
locker room to be.
</P>
<P>
   Grimsley made two turns, and as he moved closer to the umpires'
room, the slant of the stands slowly reduced his headroom. As he
neared his destination, Grimsley had to pull himself along on his
stomach, the flashlight in his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   At last, he reached where he thought the umpires' room was and
removed a tile. But he had miscalculated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a groundskeeper in there, sitting in there on a
couch,'' he said. ``I put the tile back down, but he had to know.
Thank goodness he didn't say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Now knowing precisely where he was, Grimsley moved a few feet to
his right and lifted a tile to the umpires' dressing room.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart was going 1,000 miles an hour,'' Grimsley said. ``And
in I went. I just rolled the dice. A crapshoot.''
</P>
<P>
   What if an umpire had walked in at that moment?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm nailed,'' he said. ``I'm busted.''
</P>
<P>
   Grimsley said he quickly dropped from the top of a refrigerator
to a counter top and down, and immediately spotted Belle's bat in
an umpire's locker. He made the exchange, as imperfect as it was.
According to another member of the Indians' organization, Grimsley
had to switch Belle's bat with one belonging to Paul Sorrento
because every one of Belle's bats was corked.
</P>
<P>
   Grimsley said he climbed back out, paused to make sure his
footprints were not apparent in the dust on top of the
refrigerator, and replaced the tile. ``As soon as I got back up,
somebody came back in the room,'' he said. ``I had to sit there for
about two minutes; I was about 20 or 30 feet from somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Grimsley doesn't know for sure if the person was an umpire, but
whoever it was left, and Grimsley and his accomplice returned to
the Cleveland clubhouse, four innings after the operation began,
and Grimsley informed the rest of the Indians of his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were pretty excited,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, which the Indians won 3-2, the umpires had no
doubt that the bats had been switched _ the one now in their
possession bore Sorrento's name. White Sox officials were
apoplectic, and there was talk of bringing in the FBI. Ultimately,
the Indians were told that if they returned Belle's original bat,
there would be no punishment for whoever made the switch. They
complied, and Belle was given a 10-game suspension, a penalty that
was appealed and reduced to seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Grimsley's role were not disclosed at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Grimsley said his teammates were supportive of his action, for
there was no doubt about his motivation. ``I had the interests of
the Cleveland Indians at heart,'' said Grimsley, who was later
treated to a round of golf by Belle.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Grimsley _ whose identity as the culprit was
unknown to the White Sox _ was standing in the outfield with a
couple of teammates when Mike LaValliere, a Chicago catcher, walked
over to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I heard you guys had a mission impossible last night,''
LaValliere said, smiling. ``That's beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   He walked away, leaving Grimsley grinning behind him.

DUSTY BAKER MAY BE KEY IN BEEFED-UP NL WEST COMPETITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers should be favored to win the National
League West, right? They certainly spent enough of Rupert Murdoch's
money, didn't they?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but don't overlook the Colorado Rockies. They fired a
perfectly capable manager, Don Baylor, and lured Jim Leyland to
Denver by giving him $2 million a year for three years. This is a
guy who knows how to win. Look what he did two years ago with the
Florida Marlins, the last best team money could buy.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the Arizona Diamondbacks? After only one year of
existence, they bought up all the pitchers on the free-agent market
(except the one the Dodgers got), figuring pitching was the fastest
route to respectability and the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers, Rockies, Diamondbacks _ there's hardly room for the San
Francisco Giants. But the Giants have something none of those teams
have. That would be their manager, Dusty Baker. No one in the
division writes off the Giants with Baker driving their engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dusty will find a way to get them to overachieve,'' said Sandy
Johnson, the Diamondbacks' assistant general manager and one of
Baker's many admirers.
</P>
<P>
   Leyland himself rates Baker highly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dusty Baker does as good as anybody,'' the Rockies' manager
said. ``They'll be right there in my opinion because that's just
the way he is. He won't let them not be there. Whether they win or
not, who knows? But they'll be there. You can take it to the bank.
He's too good. He's got those guys playing hard for him every day.
They respect him a lot. That's been obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants won the division title in 1997, then missed the
wild-card spot last year in a playoff loss to the Chicago Cubs.
They started this season with the West's lowest payroll (even the
downsizing San Diego Padres are paying their players more) and five
victories in their first five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``This division's so close,'' Baker said. ``An injury or two,
add a player or take a player away, that could make all the
difference in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' winter moves and their ability and readiness to
spend money to bolster their team have emboldened them to think
they will prevail in the division, but Baker has not jumped on
their bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think they got it,'' the two-time manager of the year
said shortly before the season began. ``Let them think what they
want. I don't care. They still have to play. They were picked for
first five out of the last six years, weren't they?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Baker added, the Dodgers have a good team. But he said:
``Who knows what's going to happen? Look at the Orioles. Look at
the teams everybody picks to win. You don't know what's going to
happen over there. Nobody knows. If everybody knew what's going to
happen, why start the season? Money makes you better, but money
doesn't necessarily assure you of winning. It helps. Talent
supersedes the dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   Anointed by Aaron
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. insists he is not a home run hitter, but a home
run hitter he greatly respects and admires has anointed him as one.
</P>
<P>
   With the 25th anniversary of his record-breaking 715th home run
commanding much attention recently, Henry Aaron has been asked if
he thinks anyone playing today could break his record of 755.
</P>
<P>
   ``One player who has a good chance of doing it,'' Aaron said,
``is Ken Griffey Jr. because of his age and the way he has hit home
runs the last few years. If he can stay healthy and stay focused
the way he has the last few years, he could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, the man who says he isn't a home-run hitter, has hit 56
home runs each of the last two seasons, joining Babe Ruth and Mark
McGwire as the only players who have attained the 50 plateau in
successive seasons. He began this season, his 11th, with 350 home
runs.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting 50 or more in each of the next several seasons would
certainly put Griffey in position to reach Aaron, but no one can
expect him to maintain that pace.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can he be expected to play enough seasons to hit another 400
or so.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron played 23 seasons, his final one coming at age 42. Griffey
is 29, and 13 more seasons would give him 23 and have him playing
his last season at age 41.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron never hit more than 47 home runs in a season. His next
highest total was 45. He did not lead the National League either
year. Willie Mays beat him, 49 to 45, in 1962, and Willie Stargell
topped him, 48-47, in 1971. Aaron led the league four times, three
times hitting 44, his uniform number.
</P>
<P>
   A Legendary Temper
</P>
<P>
   When Henry Aaron and Bud Selig were in their 20s and working in
Milwaukee, they went to football games together. One game in
particular stands out in Selig's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd get sideline passes for the Packers games and stand
behind the Packer bench,'' related Selig, who grew up to become the
baseball commissioner. ``The Packers were playing the Rams, and
they were scuffling. Vince Lombardi got the offensive line together
and read them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hank and I were so petrified we didn't know where to hide. He
looked at me and I looked at him. I said what should we do?
</P>
<P>
   ``We sort of cowered off to the side and watched the rest of the
game from there. Both of us were absolutely petrified. Vince's
legendary temper got us and it wasn't even aimed at us.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Long Purple Line
</P>
<P>
   And then there was one. At the end of the season's first week,
Derek Jeter of the Yankees alone remained standing among the Three
Musketeers of shortstops. Alex Rodriguez of Seattle had had surgery
for torn knee cartilage and will miss four to six weeks. Nomar
Garciaparra of Boston had a strained hamstring, and the length of
his absence was undetermined.
</P>
<P>
   Their injuries are only two of a rash that has struck front-line
players. It started with Moises Alou of Houston, who tore a knee
ligament before spring training even began.
</P>
<P>
   During the exhibition schedule, Kerry Wood of the Chicago Cubs
and Matt Morris of St. Louis each tore an elbow ligament. They both
had ligament transplants, making Tommy John the most commonly heard
name in spring training. John was the first pitcher, 25 years ago,
to have such elbow surgery.
</P>
<P>
   A fellow John played with figured in the injury business, too.
That would be Achilles, as in Achilles' tendon. Carlos Hernandez,
the San Diego catcher, ruptured his midway through the exhibition
schedule and is gone for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries have continued to plague key players. Mo Vaughn
suffered a severe high ankle sprain in Anaheim's opener and joined
two other Angels starters, shortstop Gary DiSarcina and center
fielder Jim Edmonds, on the disabled list. Pat Meares of
Pittsburgh, another shortstop, went on the disabled list with a
sprained wrist.
</P>
<P>
   Cal Ripken Jr. of Baltimore, of all people, left the Orioles'
opener early, then missed the next two games with a stiff back, the
first time since August 1981 he had missed consecutive games. He
was back in the lineup Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Awestruck in the Dugout
</P>
<P>
   It's too early, Todd Stottlemyre said, to know if following
Randy Johnson in the Arizona pitching rotation will help him or
hurt him. ``I just hope I'm not the day off for the club that has
to face him the first day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever he finds out about the order, though, the son of the
Yankees' pitching coach said he was looking forward to watching his
new teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the one guy that when he faces a club, the opposing
manager makes a makeshift lineup because there are certain guys who
aren't going to play against Randy,'' Stottlemyre said. ``He has
great possibilities of doing something really special every fifth
day. Not that he will every fifth day, but to know that I have a
chance to sit in the dugout and watch the premier power pitcher in
today's game pitch will be awesome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess it will be a lot like when guys used to be on a team
with Nolan Ryan, where he had a chance to throw a no-hitter that
day, or he had a chance to strike out a million guys that day or
whatever it was. When Nolan took the mound, there was a chance he
could do something special that day. I look at Randy in the same
way. Geez, what's he going to do today?''
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre, however, said he and his fellow Diamondbacks
pitchers would have to be careful not to get caught up in trying to
emulate Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know good and well I'm not capable of putting up Randy
Johnson numbers,'' the 33-year-old right-hander said. ``So for me
to try to keep up will take me into that arena where I'm trying to
do too much. It will be a mental challenge to remember, when you're
watching him blowing guys away, that doesn't mean I'll be able to
show up and do the same thing the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   Big Tippers, Regardless
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are the first baseball team to open a season with an
average salary of $3 million. They disavow that distinction,
however, calling it meaningless. They say they do not have the
highest payroll in the major leagues, but are only No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   They are third, behind Los Angeles and Baltimore, but in the
luxury tax computations. Those payroll figures are based on the
average annual value of the contracts of all players on 40-man
rosters and determine which five teams pay the tax at the end of
the year and how much they pay. They are the figures, the clubs
feel, that count.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' $3 million average salary is based on figures for
this season alone. This method of computing average salaries has
been used for more than 30 years and is the only one that can put
salaries in perspective. But they don't cost the teams a penny
more. Whichever set of figures is used, though, it's a lot of
money.

SPORTS COLUMN: A MAD RIOT AND A MATURE CELEBRATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST LANSING, Mich. _ March Madness bottomed out 16 days ago
after Michigan State lost to Duke in a semifinal game of the Final
Four. Minutes before the final buzzer in Florida, the first fire
was set here. Soon more than 5,000 people were rampaging through
downtown, drinking and shooting videos of each other breaking
windows, throwing bottles and vandalizing cars, including a police
cruiser. There was discussion that long night of calling out the
National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   It was only briefly national news. It is still the subject of
agonized discussion here about the limits of official authority,
curfews, relations between town and gown, restrictions on alcohol
and the willingness of students who were not involved to identify
rioting classmates in photographs and videotape. There is much talk
of reclaiming the university from its own barbarians; the riot
spilled out of a hard-partying private apartment complex for
students called Cedar Village. The last time there was so much
passion on campus was a year ago when there was a riot against a
proposed alcohol ban.
</P>
<P>
   So what's sports got to do with it?
</P>
<P>
   I brought that up at lunch last week with six senior faculty
members, a mix of philosophy, English and history professors. They
became animated. Most had been engaged by the success of the team
and followed it through the season with some excitement and
pleasure. They were not eager to link the viciousness of the riot
with Spartan basketball or even intercollegiate sports.
</P>
<P>
   So was it just a mini-spring break? The weather had turned warm
enough for comfortable mooning.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't quite ready to let it go at that, which was about
their limit of consensus. Sports was clearly some kind of excuse, a
permission to go mad. Alcohol was a fuel, and this is the Bud Lite
generation to which beer, breasts and ball games are inextricably
bound. One professor thought that because of the fear of sexually
transmitted diseases, casual violence had replaced casual sex as a
campus release. Another thought that the student population had
``tilted'' away from the ``salt of the earth'' Midwestern strivers
to a cohort of entitled yet goalless children.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a metaphor _ at least one always emerges from such
a group _ it was ESPN. Several professors thought that for many
students, the all-sports channel had become the only news channel.
For some it might have also become a carrier of values about
winning and losing rather than growing and becoming. (ESPN also
reinforces, I suspect, the vulnerable viewer as the passionate
spectator of other people's performances, of a certain slobbish
maleness revolving around beer, fast cars and a post-ironic
jokiness that insulates him against real engagement with life.)
</P>
<P>
   This is a little like blaming the epidemic of American obesity
on Ben and Jerry. They wish. Nobody is supposed to find a
categorical imperative in ``SportsCenter.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, what's to make of the president of the University of
Connecticut, whose basketball team beat Duke in the championship
game, declaring that ``athletics has enabled us to grow
exponentially''? His predecessor, who had supported the men's and
women's basketball programs, was more specific. He credited the
success of the teams with helping to secure about $1 billion from
the state Legislature, pumping up alumni donations and student
applications and attracting hot professors.
</P>
<P>
   So how can we have it both ways, I wondered, especially since
only one team a season becomes a champion. UConn wins, and when the
final score flashes at Storrs, many of the 15,000 undergraduates
build a careful bonfire of pizza boxes and sing ``Kumbaya'' all
night. Five thousand Michigan State students, most of whom were not
born in 1979 when Magic Johnson led the Spartans to their last
Final Four, run amok in defeat. OK, professors, you have an hour to
fill a blue book.
</P>
<P>
   In the rare silence, I tried to lighten the mood. So, how about
that Derek Jeter? He was brought up in Kalamazoo, only an hour from
here. Early reports from spring training have him a combination of
Michael Jordan, Billy Budd (whom they all knew well) and Adam
Graves (whom most did not).
</P>
<P>
   They were not interested; baseball is a regional game, I guess.
They chuckled indulgently at my amazement that George Steinbrenner
could call anyone a fat toad, or that the Masters, the ``cathedral
of golf,'' could desecrate tradition by remodeling four holes.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the history professor Peter Levine, a runner and
former Columbia rower now beached by a bad knee, I was able to
cheer them with news of a new training aid: www.georgesheehan.com.
The running doc, who died in 1993 at the age of 74, has loped back
to us from cyberspace. The Web site, run by some of his 12
children, includes his classic mix of ideology and practical
advice.
</P>
<P>
   The best parts for me were rereading his instructions on
stretching and his 20 rules for runners. My favorite is still No.
14: ``Give dogs their territory. Cross to the other side of the
road and pick up some object you can brandish at them. Never try to
outrun a dog. Face the dog and keep talking until it appears to be
safe to go on.''
</P>
<P>
   We all took that as ideology.

NETS' TURNAROUND IS ALL ABOUT DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

</P>
<P>
   After his first game with the New Jersey Nets, Stephon Marbury
sat in the visitors' locker room at Miami Arena and sulked. He and
his new teammates had just been crushed by 26 points, bullied and
outrun by the Miami Heat. With a bowed head and a solemn tone,
Marbury complained to reporters that the Nets did not have a
defensive clue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense is bad,'' Marbury said after that 102-76 loss on
March 14, the day before coach John Calipari was fired. ``Really
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   That night, as he flew to Toronto on the team's chartered plane,
Marbury wondered how a club with such poor defensive ability had
won 43 games and made the playoffs the year before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe they were winning last year,'' Marbury said
recently. ``Then they told me they weren't really stopping anybody.
They said they were just outscoring people, and I realized, `Yeah,
they were.'''
</P>
<P>
   When the Nets play host to the Knicks Sunday afternoon, Marbury
will have a different opinion about his team's capacity to shut
opponents down. Under the new coaching regime of Don Casey, Eddie
Jordan and Jim Lynam, the Nets have been remade defensively,
winning five of their last six games in a barrage of steals and
fast-break baskets.
</P>
<P>
   Averaging 11.3 steals over their last seven games _ the
Philadelphia 76ers, the league leader in steals, average 10.8 a
game _ the Nets (10-25) have beaten Atlanta, Miami and Toronto, all
playoff-caliber teams, and come within two points of defeating
Orlando, the Eastern Conference leader, in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like night and day,'' Marbury said. ``We're going out
with the intention of stopping people. Coach Jordan has been doing
a great job as far as making sure everyone plays hard every night
defensively. His defensive tactics have been awesome, and we've
been playing aggressive and that has allowed us to make our offense
step up.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no surprise that Jordan is behind the Nets' defensive
resurgence. As a player during the 1970s and early 1980s, Jordan
was one of the best defenders on his level. Jordan, the career
steals leader at Rutgers, led the Scarlet Knights to the Final Four
of the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament in 1976,
and two years later, as a point guard for the Nets, he was the
National Basketball Association leader in steals.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after taking over for Calipari on an interim basis and
hiring Jordan and Lynam as his assistants, Casey put Jordan in
charge of the offense and Lynam the defense. But Jordan, who was
released by Sacramento last August after going 33-64 as its head
coach, had been studying the Nets' defense on videotape since
getting the call from Casey. So he asked to be switched to the
other end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that defense wins in the league,'' said Jordan, 44, who
played for four NBA teams before retiring in 1984. ``I played for
the Lakers and we had offensive players, but our coach, Pat Riley,
stressed defense. We won a championship in 1982 with different
types of presses. My defense is what enabled me to hang around the
league for seven years. So I was looking forward to teaching it to
these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the coaching change, the Nets did not appear
capable of becoming a defensive force. Their footwork was terrible.
Their rotations were slow. Their willingness to bang was in
question. And there was no commitment to buckling down and
defending for 24 seconds. Their only hope of winning was to light
it up offensively, but since they owned the league's worst field
goal percentage, that was unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   But Jordan, seeing a quick, athletic team, thought the Nets had
great defensive potential, despite their passive play.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't disrupting the offense,'' Jordan said. ``They
weren't trying to make the offense do what the defense wanted it to
do. I saw the Nets not making the offense do things it didn't want
to do. So our thing the first couple of days after we got here was
that we have to change that and start disrupting the offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Players have said that much of their defensive tentativeness
came from Calipari's constant shifts in strategy. He would change
his philosophy by the game, depending on the opponent's personnel.
Sometimes they would trap a pick-and-roll, sometimes they would
switch it, sometimes they would fight over the pick. And there were
other options, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel comfortable out there, and I don't think the
team did either,'' Keith Van Horn said. ``We felt like we were
always kind of confused, kind of lost out there. But I don't feel
that way anymore. We've got confidence because we're going into the
game knowing what we're going to do and we feel prepared.''
</P>

 &UR; UNDATED: xxxx. &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In giving the Nets a defensive facelift, Jordan emphasized the
importance of banging the offensive player before he bangs you.
Following those orders, the Nets, despite playing without the
injured Jayson Williams, outmuscled Miami recently when they
defeated the Heat, and Marbury limited Philadelphia's Allen Iverson
to 23 points on 8-of-23 shooting last week largely because he wore
Iverson down by bumping his upper body constantly when Iverson did
not have the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan also taught the Nets the value of slapping down at the
ball when it's in the opponent's grasp, leading the Boston Celtics'
coach, Rick Pitino, to call the Nets ``one of the best slap-down
steals teams in the league'' after the Nets made 15 steals in
beating his club on Easter Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The most important change the Nets have made, though, has been
their strategic shift in defending the pick-and-roll, an NBA staple
that nearly every team runs consistently. Jordan has the Nets
defending it the way the Chicago Bulls did in winning last year's
championship against the Utah Jazz, the league's best pick-and-roll
team.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Nets see a pick-and-roll play coming, the man defending
the ball-handler, usually Marbury, pushes the dribbler toward the
baseline. The man defending the picker, usually Van Horn, drops
toward the baseline to stop the ball-handler from penetrating to
the basket. The two defenders then trap the ball handler, forcing
him to pass back to the top of the key. Anticipating the pass, a
roving Net, usually Kendall Gill, looks to make the steal and take
the ball in for a breakaway dunk.
</P>
<P>
   That is also the concept Philadelphia is using to lead the
league in takeaways. Making that play, in addition to slapping down
at balls in the paint, is what has enabled Gill to make 35 steals
over the past seven games, including an NBA-record-tying 11 against
Miami. Incidentally, Gill broke Jordan's franchise record of 10
steals in a game with that performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel rejuvenated by the defense that Eddie Jordan has put
in,'' said Gill, now the league leader in steals for the first time
in his career at 2.43 a game. ``Our new philosophy is that if we
play defense we're going to have fun. And we've been having a lot
of fun. Everybody wants to come to practice and come to the games
now, and our defense has a lot to do with that.''

 &HT;    Heat ends slump in emphatic fashion
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After losing six of seven _ the team's worst slump
since Pat Riley's first year (1995-96) _ the Heat recovered to
knock off three titans _ Washington, Toronto and Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The Raptors shot .296 in a 92-70 rout at Air Canada Centre. ``To
make a team quit like that _ it makes you feel good,'' Heat forward
P.J. Brown said. ``Vince Carter (3-for-10, 12 points) was down
tonight. He basically said, `I quit. It's too hard.'''
</P>
<P>
   OK, but Riley, unhappy with everyone except Alonzo Mourning
during the skid, refuses to acknowledge his team is out of its
slump because he doesn't want complacency, especially with Miami
chasing the Magic in the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Stealing steals lead
</P>
<P>
   Now Mookie Blaylock knows what he has to do to win another
steals title. Kendall Gill used 11 steals against the Heat (tying
an NBA record set by San Antonio's Larry Kenon in 1976), seven
against the Celtics and five more against the Wizards to go from
11th in the league to first with 2.44.
</P>
<P>
   Plain speaking
</P>
<P>
   Talking: The Bulls got waxed by 32 by the Pistons last week and
late in the game Dickey Simpkins started something when he took
down Pistons forward Grant Hill. ``All night they're taking it to
the rack. Someone had to let them know, `Hey, you can't come in
here.''' Simpkins said. ``That's part of this game, hard fouls. I
guess they made more of it because he's the great, all-American
boy. That's cool. I just wanted to let people know you can't dunk
on us and take it to the rack on us.'' Pacers give up on McKey
</P>
<P>
   A sore point around the Pacers _ literally _ has been the knee
of Derrick McKey, who has been out all season. But coach Larry Bird
said the team won't wait much longer for McKey. ``If he's not back
in the next few days, we might as well call it a season for him,''
Bird said. ``These guys who went through this tough season, to
bring another guy into the mix can hurt you. Everybody's
disappointed. But if the man's hurt, he's hurt. We need him, but
there comes a time of the season when you've got to make a decision
whether he should come back or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Dumars milestone
</P>
<P>
   Joe Dumars played in his 1,000th game, becoming the 56th to do
it, the 10th with one team and the eighth to do it with his first
team. The other eight: Hal Greer, Dolph Schayes, Hakeem Olajuwon,
Karl Malone, John Stockton, Calvin Murphy and John Havlicek.
</P>
<P>
   Game operations crews fined
</P>
<P>
   The NBA finally took action to rein in the game operations crews
that run rampant league-wide. The Raptors' bunch game drew a quiet
$10,000 slap for actions in a game against the Knicks on March 21.
When former Raptor Marcus Camby entered the game, the PA system
played the sound of a baby crying. Also, when guard Latrell
Sprewell was at the free-throw line, the stadium scoreboards
flashed the word ``choke,'' referring to Sprewell's infamous
altercation with Golden State coach P.J. Carlesimo a year ago.

 &HT;    Rider blazes aimless trail in Portland
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Despite the mindless behavior of their most talented
player, the victories keep on coming for the Portland Trail
Blazers. They are the NBA's best team with one of the league's
worst characters _ the infamous Isaiah (J.R.) Rider, who gives new
meaning to the word distraction.
</P>
<P>
   Rider, as usual, has been a one-man annoyance, finding trouble
at nearly every turn. On a team less centered, he'd be the mother
of all adversities, taking away from a gifted team that's played
marvelously and unselfishly.
</P>
<P>
   But the Blazers, 21 games over .500 going into the weekend,
somehow seemingly ignore Rider's antics and plow ahead. And if
there's one thing that makes them scary come the playoffs, that
would be it: Their ability to stay the course in the face of
Hurricane Rider.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed,'' Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy admitted.
``I'm disappointed that we're a team that has the best record in
the league and we're having to fight through the things that we
shouldn't have to fight through.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be Rider. In one whirlwind week, the 6-foot-4 guard
covered many bases afoul of the law and good sense. He was
suspended by the NBA for a game for charging a fan in the stands
who had gotten into an argument with his brother at Golden State;
it was learned he received his second multiviolation traffic stop
in Portland in five weeks; and, for good measure, Rider and the
Blazers were sued by a Detroit fan he spat on during a game last
season _ an incident that resulted in a three-game suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just hopeful that this is the end of it for our whole
team, not just J.R.,'' Dunleavy said. ``Hopefully, nobody gets into
a situation they shouldn't be in.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: Rider, clean up your act. Please.
</P>
<P>
   However, with a career checkered with suspensions _ three of the
one-game variety this season _ this reality is firm: What you see
in Isaiah Rider is what you don't want to get, but do anyway.
</P>
<P>
   To keep distracted from the distractions, Dunleavy manages a
roster that is among the deepest in the league. No one has had a
career year, but most of his players have been steady and
productive. Point guard Damon Stoudamire has had flashes of
brilliance, but not been the lightning rod of his first two years.
Rasheed Wallace brings energy on the front line; Walt Williams is a
versatile swing man off the bench; Brian Grant's a fierce rebounder
and inside scorer; Arvydas Sabonis is the deft-passing center;
Jimmy Jackson brings scoring off the bench; Greg Anthony is an
aggressive defender in the backcourt.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's former Atlanta Hawk Stacey Augmon doing things
defensively and in the open court, and Lithonia's Kelvin Cato
bringing big-man relief. That's a 10-man rotation, which is
virtually unheard of in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard, but it's fun,'' Dunleavy said of dealing with all
that talent. ``You've got to keep guys _ I don't know if happy is
the right word. It's more like they've got to keep me happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough of his players have done that. So much so, that no less
than Uneasy Rider said: ``We all feel like we're going to win every
game, even if we're not playing really good. Once we (Rider and
Stoudamire) start playing well, we will be deadly.''
</P>
<P>
   The most likely Blazer-killer is Rider. Portland has shown it
can overcome him. But for how long?

 &HT;    John Thompson could be next Nets coach
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The third coaching casualty of the season sparked
widespread speculation around the league about future moves. Could
Maurice Cheeks be in for the Wizards, replacing fired Bernie
Bickerstaff? Is former Georgetown coach John Thompson be headed to
New Jersey? Or would it be Mike Fratello? And what of Jeff Van
Gundy with his floundering Knicks?
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who several years ago turned down a chance to be coach
and general manager of the Denver Nuggets, is reportedly expected
to be offered the reins of the Nets, replacing interim Don Casey,
who took over for fired John Calipari.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets wanted to talk to New Jersey native Fratello, the
Cleveland coach, before they hired Calipari in 1996, but moved on
when the Cavs insisted on center Shawn Bradley in return for
interviewing Fratello.
</P>
<P>
   But Thompson seems to be getting pushed for the job by none
other than agent David Falk, who has clients Stephon Marbury, Keith
Van Horn and Kerry Kittles on the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the Hudson River, it's getting more and
more tight for Van Gundy. The Knicks went into the weekend out of
the playoffs. Someone has to pay for that. Asked if he believes the
decision on his fate already has been made, Van Gundy told Newsday:
``I don't know. . . . And I couldn't care less. What I mean is, I
think I've been through a lot, and I don't think necessarily I've
always been, uh. . . . I think it's something that comes sometimes
from my own organization. I've sort of been put out there on a limb
a little bit. And I know I can do this job and will do this job
better than anyone they get. So I say, (forget) it. I don't care.
If they decide they need to do something else? Well, they will.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheeks, the former Philadelphia point guard and now 76ers
assistant coach, was interviewed last week by the Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando coach Chuck Daly summed up the coaching carousel: ``It's
the business. You never hear of anyone in the league office losing
their job. You rarely hear about a general manager getting fired.
And scouts are pretty secure, too. There's a hot seat with every
franchise, and it's usually where the coach sits.''
</P>
<P>
   It ain't my fault
</P>
<P>
   Reviled in Chicago as the man who broke up a dynasty, Bulls
general manager Jerry Krause said last week that he was not
responsible for Michael Jordan, coach Phil Jackson, Scottie Pippen,
Dennis Rodman, Luc Longley, Steve Kerr and Jud Buechler leaving in
the dismantling of the six-time champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody chased them away,'' he said. ``They left on their own.
And the team? It simply got old. And when a team gets old, you have
to make changes. Nobody wants to win more than I do. And nobody
hated to see Michael retire more than I did. The dynasty never was
going to last forever. It had to change.''
</P>
<P>
   It was speculated the Bulls would pursue possible free agents
Kobe Bryant, Allen Iverson, Antoine Walker, Zydrunas Ilgauskas or
Stephon Marbury, but each re-signed with their teams, making them
unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys, meaning the media, missed a very important point
here,'' Krause said. ``You guys linked up us with players that we
were not even interested in. Just because a guy is a good player
does not mean that he will be our kind of player. And when some of
these good players re-sign with their own teams we don't see that
as a loss because we never wanted him anyway,'' Krause said.
</P>
<P>
   Who, then, does Krause want? Oliver Miller?
</P>
<P>
   THEY SAID IT
</P>
<P>
   ''No, I don't use the term that loosely,'' Dallas coach Don
Nelson said about his early-season proclamation that Michael Finley
would elevate to a ''great'' player.
</P>
<P>
   ''How do you defend him? You don't. You end up on the bench (in
foul trouble),'' Golden State's Jason Caffey said about guarding
Utah's Karl Malone.
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS UP
</P>
<P>
   To the Denver Nuggets. After 17 road losses in a row this season
_ and 25 spanning last year and this _ they won a game away from
Colorado. It was in Vancouver, which isn't exactly the Delta
Center, but it counts.
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS DOWN
</P>
<P>
   To the New York Knicks. They made a series of moves to upgrade
themselves, but have apparently quit on embattled coach Jeff Van
Gundy. If the playoffs started this weekend, the Knicks would be
out. They have better talent than that.

 &HT;    Jazz showing steel for stretch run
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Let's see how much the Jazz have left for the stretch
run. Starting Thursday they faced 16 games in 23 nights, quite a
chore for an old team. The good news: 10 are at home, six on the
road. Says Karl Malone: ``You try not to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Literally, you have to focus on playing one game at a time.
You only worry about tonight's game, not tomorrow night's game,''
John Stockton said.
</P>
<P>
   The most difficult task: ``Staying mentally ready,'' Bryon
Russell said. ``You'll be all right physically, because there's
always time to get your rest but it becomes a mind over matter kind
of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz showed how tough they are by ripping the Lakers down
the stretch Tuesday with Atlanta native Shandon Anderson scoring
all of his 12 points in the final 9:48 against a clueless Kobe
Bryant. Anderson went to the hoop and took passes from the Mailman,
who was out on the wing entertaining Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   Discord among the Lakers
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, back in Tinseltown, the Lakers are very upset about
their defense and fingers pointed at Bryant for free-lancing and
losing track of Anderson. Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal, not
naming names but sounding ominous: ``The school I came from, a guy
isn't doing his job, you just take him out _ immediately.'' . . .
Rick Fox, sounding increasingly unhappy with his decision to return
to the Lakers: ``Bottom line is they beat us playing their game.
And they took us out of our game. To be quite honest with you, I'm
not sure what is our game is.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC unlucky for Rockets
</P>
<P>
   When the Houston Rockets completed a practice in Seattle, NBC's
Bob Costas bet he could make eight of 10 free throws, offering $100
to anyone bold enough to challenge him. He made six and paid up.
That's the least he can do, since Houston is awful in NBC games,
1-12 the last two years, with three more Sunday dates coming up,
starting with today's return visit to the Delta Center and the
Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers weighs on Clippers
</P>
<P>
   If they don't win two more games, the Clippers will finish 5-45,
a .100 percentage, which is even worse than the '72-'73 76ers'
record .110, making the Clippers the worst team ever. Poetic
justice there. One reason is Rodney Rogers' dismal campaign. After
posting career numbers (15.1 ppg., 5.6 rebounds) last season, he
showed up for his free agent year too heavy, went to the bench and
is averaging 8.4 ppg. and 4.6 rebounds. ``I really didn't think
that we were going to play (because of the lockout),'' Rogers said.
``That was dumb on my part. I should have been getting myself
prepared. My contract year and coming in not ready to play really
hurt me.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidd's passing phase
</P>
<P>
   After committing three turnovers in the first quarter of
Tuesday's game in Los Angeles, Jason Kidd complained the game ball
was too flat. After committing three turnovers in the second
quarter with a new ball, Kidd decided this one was too bouncy. But
after throwing the ball away three more times in the third quarter.
Kidd finally came to more logical conclusion. ``It was me. I was
horrible.'' So staring into the abyss of losing to the then-3-27
Clippers, Kidd decided to stop passing in the fourth quarter just
to see what might happen. The result: 15 points in the last 12
minutes and a 88-83 win.
</P>
<P>
   Payton vs. Baker
</P>
<P>
   Gary Payton and injured power forward Vin Baker got into a
verbal battle during a Seattle scrimmage in Sacramento. Baker took
the worse end of an exchange that lasted 10 minutes. Payton, an
accomplished trash talker, told Baker that he is ``out of shape,''
``soft,'' and told him to ``put on a uniform.'' Baker was activated
Thursday after being on the injured list with a partially torn
thumb ligament.

 &HT;    DL worth a reach to Reeves
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The NFL draft is six days away, and coach Dan Reeves
continues to say the Falcons have put a premium on getting a top
defensive lineman and/or defensive back.
</P>
<P>
   Despite subscribing to the ``best player available'' theory,
Reeves, like every NFL coach, sometimes picks a player to fill a
need even when there are other players available who rate higher.
</P>
<P>
   So it's possible that when the Falcons' first choice, No. 30,
rolls around, they could take a defensive lineman ranked, say, No.
40, over a cornerback ranked No. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because there don't figure to be many quality defensive
linemen left when Atlanta picks again, late in the third round.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, though, Reeves has gambled and lost. In 1988, Reeves
and current Falcons college scouting chief Reed Johnson selected
Syracuse nose tackle Ted Gregory in the first round. Gregory never
played in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 with the Falcons, Johnson and Reeves tabbed Indiana
defensive tackle Nathan Davis early in the second round. Davis did
not have a tackle as a rookie and quit on the first day of training
camp last summer. He's with the Cowboys now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two biggest mistakes I've ever made were defensive lineman
we were trying to make into players,'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia defensive end Patrick Kerney and LSU defensive tackle
Anthony McFarland are expected to be gone by the time the Falcons
pick. Florida defensive tackle Reggie McGrew is a possibility, as
is Florida State defensive end Tony Bryant. West Virginia defensive
tackle John Thornton and Saginaw Valley State defensive end Lamar
King also intrigue Atlanta, but probably not enough to invest a
first-round choice. Not shopping for a RB
</P>
<P>
   Might the Falcons consider looking for a running back in the
middle or late rounds while Byron Hanspard continues his recovery
from two torn knee ligaments? ``No,'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   Moving soon?
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons should know within six weeks where their new home
will be next year.
</P>
<P>
   The sites under consideration, all roughly 15-30 acres, are in
Gwinnett, Hall, Forsyth and Barrow counties, including a site at
Chateau Elan. Also, officials at Stone Mountain Park in DeKalb
County have been swapping ideas with the Falcons. Workout news
</P>
<P>
   Running back Jamal Anderson, free safety Eugene Robinson, right
guard Gene Williams, wide receiver/return man Tim Dwight,
cornerback Elijah Williams and practice-squad tackle Greg Studdard
have not participated in the offseason conditioning program.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves said Gene Williams' wife recently had a child. Dwight,
Elijah Williams and Studdard are finishing college degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has between $1.5 million and $1.6 million left to spend
under the salary cap. ... The Jacksonville Jaguars are scheduled to
scrimmage Atlanta on Saturday, Aug. 7 at Furman University. ... The
Falcons have 59 players on the roster, and can take 80 to training
camp. ... There has been no significant talks in two weeks between
Falcon officials and the agent for Anderson about a contract
extension. ... The Falcons' third preseason game, Aug. 27 at
Tennessee, will be televised by ESPN at 8 p.m.

 &HT;    Thoroughly NFL pedigree in secondary
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ NFL scouts often describe cornerback prospects in
terms associated with champion racehorses. The thoroughbred
comparisons might be more appropriate than usual for the 1999
draft, which features its share of family ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like with horses, there may be something to the whole
issue of good bloodlines,'' said Southern Cal cornerback Daylon
McCutcheon, whose father is former NFL running back Lawrence
McCutcheon, the second-leading rusher in Rams history and still a
scout for the team. ``Look at the guys (at the combine) who have
some NFL legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   The cornerback position is stocked with players with
NFL-pedigree blood. Chris McAlister of Arizona is the son of former
Philadelphia and New England tailback James McAlister. Alabama's
Fernando Bryant has a pair of uncles, wide receiver Ray Griffin
(Detroit) and cornerback Don Griffin (San Francisco and Cleveland),
who played in the league. Fred Vinson of Vanderbilt is a cousin of
Arizona cornerback Corey Chavous.
</P>
<P>
   Even the premier cornerback prospect, Champ Bailey of Georgia,
can claim an NFL connection. Older brother Ronald Bailey, a former
Bulldogs cornerback, was an undrafted free agent in camp with
Dallas last summer, recently signed with Tampa Bay and is playing
in the NFL Europe League.
</P>
<P>
   McAlister acknowledged recently that he feels an advantage over
other players because of his NFL family ties. ``My father can sit
and talk with me on all the good things about the league,''
McAlister said. ``And about all the other things, too, like being
able to overcome adversity.''
</P>
<P>
   McAlister is considered the No. 2 corner prospect but viewed by
many scouts as having better mechanics than Bailey. The Arizona
standout already has demonstrated an ability to handle tough times.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA flagged his SAT scores when he was coming out of
Pasadena (Calif.) High School. Instead of enrolling at UCLA, his
father's alma mater, he wound up at San Antonio Junior College for
a year before signing with Arizona. The elder McAlister had a
similar problem at UCLA. Chris McAlister also was suspended for one
game last season for a student loan that the NCAA deemed improper.
</P>
<P>
   Through the difficult times, he persevered, and his size and
speed have made him a hot commodity and probable top 10 selection.
McAlister is one of the few cornerbacks with the kind of size that
scouts like; a shortage in this draft will force teams to look at
such players as Antwan Edwards of Clemson at corner first.
</P>
<P>
   As it has been the past few years, the draft is thin at safety.
A safety might not be taken until the late second or early third
round.

 &HT;    No. 1 hopeful Couch gets second audition
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This is the day of reckoning for Kentucky quarterback
Tim Couch, who for the second time in a month gets the chance to
convince the Cleveland Browns he should be the No. 1 overall choice
in the NFL draft. In addition to the Brown's top two football men _
vice president Dwight Clark and coach Chris Palmer _ owner Al
Lerner and club president Carmen Policy will be among the team's
11-man contingent in Lexington for the private session this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really want to put him to the test,'' said Palmer, who will
conduct the workout. At a March 11 session in which tutor Larry
Kennan set the agenda, Couch threw just 46 passes. He can expect to
throw 75 to 80 today. An interesting stat on Couch: The Browns
dissected each of his 553 pass attempts from 1998 in Hal Mumme's
four-wideout set and found that two-thirds of them traveled 10
yards or less.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their kind words for Heisman winner Ricky Williams after
last week's session, the Browns aren't likely to take the Texas
tailback and the choice probably boils down to Couch or Oregon
quarterback Akili Smith. Cleveland was less than wowed by Williams.
While he weighed in at 224 pounds, down 20 from what he was at the
combine, Williams still looked soft to scouts. And his 40-yard
times _ 4.6-4.7 against the wind and the low 4.5s with it _ were
not eye-popping.
</P>
<P>
   Much ado about . . .
</P>
<P>
   League vice president of labor relations Harold Henderson will
investigate salary cap maneuvers by Dallas owner Jerry Jones, but
don't expect even a rap on the knuckles from commissioner Paul
Tagliabue. The Cowboys have reached agreements with center Mark
Stepnoski, wideout Rocket Ismail and linebacker Quentin Coryatt but
have yet to execute the contracts. They need to clear cap room by
redoing the deals of quarterback Troy Aikman and cornerback Deion
Sanders. Teams have complained about the Cowboys' tactics, but it
is commonplace. Tennessee did the same thing with linebacker Eddie
Robinson and fullback Lorenzo Neal. The Titans reached a verbal
accord months ago with guard Bruce Matthews but the contract still
hasn't been filed with the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is interested in free agent defensive end Derrick
Alexander, a five-year veteran from Minnesota. His agent has
exchanged proposals with Falcons GM Harold Richardson, but the team
might prefer to wait until after the draft. Alexander also is
talking with Cleveland but would prefer to play here. ... Seattle
will sign free agent wideout Sean Dawkins on Monday. ... Add Dallas
to the teams now interested in Rams quarterback Tony Banks. The
Ravens also have investigated Banks as an alternative to signing
Warren Moon as a backup. The Cowboys called at least one NFC West
team to see if they would be interested in trading for wideout
Michael Irvin. ... Jets coach Bill Parcells would deal third-down
back Leon Johnson for the right price. ... Pittsburgh offensive
right tackle Justin Strzelczyk re-injured his knee while leaping
over a bar during a tavern brawl. Strzelczyk is done for the
season. The Steelers, who last week signed Rams free agent Wayne
Gandy to play left tackle, are considering Bengals free agent
Anthony Brown for the right tackle spot. ... Look for Jacksonville
to fill its hole at middle linebacker by drafting Tennessee's Al
Wilson in the first round. ... Miami coach Jimmy Johnson wants to
deal out of the first round and take McNeese State tailback Cecil
Collins in the second.

 &HT;    The bass tours' reel women
 &HT;    By Scott Bernarde
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Pam Martin might be one of the most skilled Georgia
anglers of either gender, but she doesn't necessarily look at
herself as a trailblazer. At the same time, she wouldn't mind being
thought of that way.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, 36, has made a mark on tournament bass fishing in her
dozen years of competing in top-level events. The all-time money
leader and two-time angler of the year in the now-defunct Bass'n
Gal tournament circuit, the Bainbridge angler, who first began
honing her skills as a child on weekend camping trips with her
parents and grandparents to Lake Seminole, is one of a handful of
female pros standing out in the male-dominated sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'd call myself a trailblazer, but I would
hope in my 12 years of fishing I have influenced someone to at
least get out and enjoy the outdoors,'' said Martin, also an avid
turkey hunter. ``I'm not one of the founders or the first ones, but
having met some of the goals I've made, I would hope someone would
look at me that way.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a safe bet someone is, especially with Martin's
credentials. Along with the Bass'n Gal accomplishments, she is one
of the leading competitors on the relatively young Women's Bass
Fishing Association. She was third in points standings and second
in the season-ending championship. She also has competed alongside,
and beaten, men in big tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Martin fished three years on the Wal-Mart FLW Tour, one of the
two major professional circuits that attract most of the sport's
top anglers. In 1997, she finished 25th in the Forrest Wood Open on
Lake Minnetonka, Minn., and was 10th in another event, on Lake
Seminole, her home lake, after leading the field for the first
round. Her abilities have attracted several sponsors who typically
back her male counterparts, such as Ranger boats, Evinrude outboard
motors and All-Star rods.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 12 years, (tournament fishing) is all I've known, but I've
seen an acceptance by the general public that it's OK for women to
compete in tournaments,'' Martin says. ``And, you know, the bass
don't know if you're male or female.''
</P>
<P>
   Fishing against men never dissuaded Martin nor the others who
have followed former Bass'n Gal champion Vojai Reed, the first
woman to enter a major men's tournament when she competed in a
BASSMaster event in 1991. Until the 1990-91 season, the Bass
Anglers Sportsman Society rulebook had specified that only men
could compete in its tournaments. When the Montgomery, Ala.-based
company changed the wording in the rulebook, it in essence opened
the door to women to try their luck in bass fishing's top events.
</P>
<P>
   There are seven female professionals as listed by the
Association of Bass Professionals who compete in BASS events. The
most notable of the group is Sherrie Brubaker, last year's WBFA
champion, who competed in the BASSMaster Central Division this
season. Marcia Fann of Florida finished 47th in the Eastern
Division points standings.
</P>
<P>
   Results are showing on the stat sheets at male-dominated
tournaments. Last March, Wanda Rucker, a 48-year-old Cocoa, Fla.,
grandmother, became the first woman to win a Red Man tournament _
after more than 2,500 Red Man events since 1979. Rucker has noticed
more women in Red Man tournaments since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the last (Red Man) tournament at Lake Okeechobee, there
were like 15 women in the field. There were never more than five or
six before,'' said Rucker, who won there last year. ``So what does
that tell you? Maybe they're either trying to get my butt or
they're following my lead and think they can (win), too. ... I
really do feel I've encouraged some women.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the successes has come acceptance from the male
anglers. ``Maybe at first, the men, when they saw the women in the
crowd, they may have thought, `Oh, no. What if I get a woman (as a
partner)?''' Rucker said. ``But most of the men I've fished with
have become friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Rucker still holds the women's record for the one-day stringer
she caught in a Red Man tournament in 1997; it was 22 pounds, and
she finished fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Martin says that fishing has always been a part of her life, and
she's had hundreds of opportunities to fish with men.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as fishing with men is concerned, that's never been a
problem,'' she said. ``I've been fishing long enough that a lot of
these guys know me. I've always felt right at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the crossover successes of Martin, Rucker and others,
the state of women's professional bass fishing is still in the
developmental stage. Attracting sponsors can be difficult. In fact,
even though Bass'n Gal existed for more than 20 years and had more
than 30,000 members, it closed its doors in January 1998 partly
because it was tough to get sponsors. ``It's proving hard to
attract sponsors because it's perceived as a man's sport,'' said
WBFA President Willie Cook, who points out that more than 13
million women in the United States buy fishing licences every year.
``My saying is that the gender stops where the line begins.''
</P>
<P>
   The WBFA, which started in 1997, has been received pretty well
in the industry so far. ``This circuit's coming on strong,'' said
Martin. ``They're out there to really promote the ladies.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Martin has her sights set on the big trails, where six
figures and lucrative endorsements await the winners. ``Whether
it's FLW, EverStart or BASS, I will definitely be fishing something
other than (the WBFA).

 &HT;    Stefan still No. 1 in draft, but doubts emerging
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News ServiceCzech Republic native Patrik Stefan
<TEXT>
remains the consensus top player in the June entry draft, but teams
_ including the Thrashers _ might be starting to have second
thoughts about selecting him. Stefan, who has been playing with the
Long Beach Ice Dogs of the IHL, suffered at least his second
concussion of the season last week and will miss the rest of the
season. The 18-year-old, who missed 38 games earlier this season
with a concussion and spinal injury, last week was knocked
unconscious for nine minutes when he collided with the knee of Las
Vegas forward Kevin Kaminsky. Kaminsky suffered a torn knee
ligament. Although the decision to sit out the remainder of the
season is somewhat precautionary, long-term effects of the
concussions and Stefan's durability have come into question. He
also has had groin and knee ailments. Tampa Bay adviser Cliff
Fletcher already is making comparisons to Brett Lindros, the
brother of Eric Lindros, who retired after just 51 NHL games
because of repeated concussions. ``Everybody is going to have to do
their homework on him,'' Nashville general manager David Poile
said. Stefan told a Long Beach newspaper that he is still having
headaches. ``I was so excited to be back, and then this happens,''
he said. He did not question the check by Kaminsky but said, ``I
think these players in the league want to give me something.'' The
Thrashers will pick first, second or third in the draft, depending
on the result of a lottery next month.

   THRASHERS UPDATE
</P>
<P>
   As general manager Don Waddell scouts amateurs in Europe,
goaltending consultant Andy Moog is continuing to critique NHL,
minor-league and draft-eligible goalies. Moog, who lives near
Dallas, says he has filed reports on 15 to 20 players and sees two
to three games a week. ``It's just my own observations on a guy,''
said Moog, who can't discuss NHL goalies publicly, because of
tampering rules. ``I've never done this before, so I don't know if
it reads like an official scouting report.'' Asked if he felt
confident that the Thrashers would land a strong goaltender in the
expansion draft, Moog said, ``That's not up to me. I know there's a
surplus of goaltenders right now. But it depends on what all the
teams do (with their protected lists). There could still be some
trades.

 &HT;    Questions about ailing Lindros
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A few lingering issues during Eric Lindros' recovery
from a collapsed lung:
</P>
<P>
   1. Philadelphia's initial suggestion that Lindros could return
for the playoffs was misguided. Lindros had approximately three
liters of blood, or half that in his body, seep into his chest
cavity. It will take three to four months just for that blood to be
regenerated. That doesn't take into account time for conditioning
and the star's emotional rehabilitation. He has been told that if
he had taken the team flight from Nashville back to Philadelphia
instead of checking into a hospital, he might have died on the
plane. Is Lindros going to be ready to step back onto the ice this
year?
</P>
<P>
   2. Lindros has only a handshake agreement on a contract for next
season. Given his history of injuries and a now uncertain future,
specifics of that deal might be re-visited.
</P>
<P>
   3. Lindros's absence gives the Flyers an excuse if they exit the
playoffs early. The question is whether owner Ed Snider will let it
affect his critique of GM Bob Clarke and coach Roger Neilson.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane warning
</P>
<P>
   Carolina backup goalie Trevor Kidd wasn't lured into a false
sense of security when he signed a two-year, $4 million contract
extension recently _ and his fears were reaffirmed when the
Hurricanes signed No. 1 goalie Arturs Irbe to a three-year deal
totaling $5.8 million. Kidd almost certainly will be exposed in the
expansion draft to the Thrashers. By selecting him, Atlanta not
only could strengthen its goaltending but also weaken that of a
Southeast Division opponent. ``If they're going to make a decision
now based on stats and games played,'' Kidd said, ``then you don't
have to be a rocket scientist to figure out that I'm going to be
the odd man out.'' There are advantages and disadvantages to
leaving Carolina, he said. ``This is a great place to play,'' he
said. ``My family enjoys it here. But I'm not going to be Mr. Nice
Guy again next year, playing 22-24 games.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh's Jaromir Jagr criticized coach Kevin Constantine in
a Czech Republic newspaper: ``I don't like the way he prepares the
team, and I'm not the only one among the players. His communication
with us is just awful. Either he yells at us or he just hides
somewhere.'' The two aren't saying much publicly about the remarks.
... Carolina coach Paul Maurice on gripes that the slumping
Hurricanes will be afforded the No. 3 playoff seed for winning the
Southeast Division: ``We don't make the rules.'' ... Tampa Bay was
so happy to dump high-salaried backup goalie Bill Ranford that it
will receive nothing in return if Ranford plays in four or fewer
playoff games. The Lightning gets a fifth-round pick if Ranford
plays in at least five postseason games or a fourth if he plays in
10 or more. ... Boston's Byron Dafoe became only the sixth goalie
since the expansion era, from 1967-68, to record at least 10
shutouts in a season.

 &HT;    Robinson talks way out of L.A.
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For a Hall of Fame player and someone who always lhad
the respect of his players, Larry Robinson is picking a strange way
to end his coaching tenure in Los Angeles. Robinson now concedes
that he doesn't know if he wants to continue behind the bench,
although indications are that Kings ownership already has decided
to make a change. An emotional guy, Robinson ripped his players and
seemed to wash himself of all responsibility when the Kings lost
for the sixth time in seven games and were cropped from the playoff
picture. ``Some of them are just playing it out,'' he said.
``That's what it looks like. I don't have anything to lose, but
some of these guys are playing for their contracts, for their jobs
next year. ... If they don't care to play on the ice, why should I
care? I'm not the one losing.'' Robinson continued his verbal
assault, saying, ``It was easy to play last year when things were
going well, but you really see the true colors of a person when
there's some adversity. Ones that can step up and play through
adversity, those are the ones you want to have around. The others?
Let them go. Cull those out. You're only going to make yourself
better.'' Two days later, Robinson turned the focus back on
himself, saying he already has had discussions with general manager
Dave Taylor about staying in the system as a minor-league
instructor. But he might have talked his way out of that job.

   Marc Crawford is 7-22-5 (.279) since replacing Mike Keenan
(15-24-6, .467) as Vancouver's coach, but he seems to have the
support of his players during this painful transition period.
Crawford has won their respect with more teaching and less
intimidating than Keenan. ``This was a club that under Mike was a
high energy club that forechecked a great deal and really tried to
create havoc,'' Crawford said. ``We've tried to add a little bit
more structure to our play and play with a little bit more purpose
offensively and defensively.''

   Colorado goalie Patrick Roy upset Edmonton players when he took
four shots down ice at an empty net in an attempt to score his
first goal. Mike Grier called it ``selfish.'' Roy's response: ``I
guess they respect my shot because there were all ready at the blue
line.'' ... Dallas' power play _ 9 for 80 _ has dropped from first
to sixth in the rankings. ... Change of scenery: Goalie Bill
Ranford was 3-18-3 with a 3.90 goals-against average with Tampa
Bay. He is 2-0 and 2.50 with Detroit. ``It's like a new life coming
here,'' he said. ... Edmonton GM Glen Sather says rumors that he is
headed to San Jose are untrue and a year old, adding, ``I'm not
going. You've even got (Sharks GM Dean) Lombardi thinking I'm going
to take his job.'' ... You might have to scratch San Jose's Steve
Shields as a potential unprotected goalie for the Thrashers.
Shields has played so well for the Sharks down the stretch that
it's possible the team will protect him and expose veteran Mike
Vernon. Shields made 33 saves in a 1-0 win over Phoenix on
Wednesday to drop his GAA to 2.16.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ever since a U.S. Air Force F-117 was downed over
Yugoslavia on March 27, Pentagon officials have puzzled over what
could have brought down one of the world's stealthiest warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, after extensive interviews with the pilot, a
review of technical clues and an analysis of how the Serbian air
defenses have been operating, a secret Air Force inquiry now
believes a combination of tactics, quick learning and luck came
together in one brilliant moment to shoot down the premier attack
jet in America's arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   The culprit, they believe, is an SA-3 surface-to-air missile.
But it probably was not used in the normal fashion, with its
operators relying only on their own local radars to detect the
target.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Air Force and other military officials now believe that
Serbian spotters in Serbia, and perhaps in Bosnia and along the
Montenegrin coast, may have patched together enough quick glimpses
of the warplane from scattered radars to track the elusive
aircraft, however briefly, to fire a missile from a battery near
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs used their radar sparingly in order to avoid a
counterattack by the NATO fighter.
</P>
<P>
   For the Serbs, it was a longshot, low-tech solution to a
challenge posed by one of the most sophisticated warplanes in the
world, Pentagon officials said. In the end, it may have been
tactics aided by a lot of luck, and not technology, that brought
down the F-117 and gave Belgrade a propaganda windfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think whoever did this won the lotto that night,'' said one
senior American officer.
</P>
<P>
   NATO and Pentagon officials have such respect for Yugoslavia's
air defenses that low-flying attack planes have flown only a
handful of strike missions. But shooting down an F-117 showed
unusual skill. In addition to its radar-absorbing skin and
radar-scattering angles, the Nighthawk, as the F-117 is called,
typically flies a zig-zag pattern to avoid tracking.
</P>
<P>
   The F-117 is not invisible, but barely visible to most radars.
It is most vulnerable when turning suddenly at low altitudes, which
can reflect radar beams to receivers, or when opening its bomb bay
door.
</P>
<P>
   What American military officials now suspect is that Serbian
spotters, perhaps starting with spies in Italy watching the F-117s
take off, were able to determine a rough schedule of how long it
took the planes to cross the Adriatic, and how long to fly to
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing this, Serbian radar operators would have a better sense
of when and where to watch. Once a shadowy figure crossed their
screens, they would alert the operator down the line. The downed
F-117 had already dropped at least one of its laser-guided,
2,000-pound bombs near Belgrade, so that was another clue.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are unsure now whether Serbian gunners were able to
integrate this net of far-flung radars to feed the location of the
plane to a missile launcher, or to cue up the SA-3s own radar so
the operator had only to briefly flip it on to track and fire.
</P>
<P>
   Since the stealth plane went down, other planes on bombing runs
have recorded instances when the Serbian forces lobbed
surface-to-air missiles at them without radar guidance. This is
clearly less reliable, but it lets the Serbian missile sites avoid
counterstrikes by NATO's fighters, whose own missiles can home in
on the beams of Serbian ground radars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the limited air space over there and the sophisticated
air defense system they have,'' the senior American officer said,
``there's always the possibility of a kill.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the Pentagon says the cause of what downed the plane
is still under investigation. But military officials familiar with
the inquiry say this account is emerging as the most likely
explanation of what caused the first-ever F-117 lost in combat, and
the only manned aircraft felled so far in the aerial bombardment of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

<P>

</P>
<P>
   After the crash, the Air Force assembled a secret team of
experts in air defenses, stealth technology and other technical
areas, and dispatched them under strict security to Langley Air
Force Base in Virginia to figure out what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Michael E. Ryan, the Air Force chief of staff, recently
reviewed a draft of the team's report and sent it back to answer
additional questions, a senior Pentagon official said. The final
report is expected to be forwarded soon to Ryan and Gen. Henry H.
Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon refused Saturday to comment
on any detail of the F-117 downing to avoid tipping off the
Yugoslav military. ``The Yugoslav air defense system is both
sophisticated and adaptable,'' Bacon said in an interview. ``The
Yugoslav forces are attempting to make rapid adjustments in the way
they use their air defenses to shoot down U.S. planes while
protecting their radars and missiles from allied attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is the account that experts now say is the most likely
scenario.
</P>
<P>
   The F-117s, operating out of the Aviano air base in northern
Italy, typically were flying missions at medium altitude, between
15,000 feet and 25,000 feet: close enough to drop their payloads
with near pinpoint accuracy, but out of reach of most of
Yugoslavia's anti-aircraft fire and surface-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
   At about 8:45 p.m. in the Balkans on March 27, the fourth night
of the air war, an F-117 Nighthawk was heading back to base after
dropping at least one of its 2,000-pound, laser-guided bombs on a
target near heavily defended Belgrade. Bad weather, which had
forced scores of missions canceled, did not hinder the Nighthawk,
two senior Air Force officers said.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, with little or no warning, an SA-3 missile streaking
at three times the speed of sound and guided by an improvised
network of Serbian radars, exploded in a blast of fragments a few
feet from the bat-winged plane, slamming it into an uncontrolled
dive.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-aircraft missiles have warheads with 130 pounds of high
explosives that are designed to detonate when the projectile gets
within about 20 feet of its target.
</P>
<P>
   Alarms in the radar-evading F-117's cockpit usually warn a pilot
when a SAM radar is homing in, or painting, his plane. But the
Yugoslav military so fears the anti-radiation missiles that NATO
warplanes launch at these radars, it has largely turned them off.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether the pilot got any warning of the missile
bearing in on him. If he did, it was probably too late. Stunned by
the explosion, the veteran pilot struggled against pressure five
times the force of gravity to yank the handles below his seat to
eject from the crippled warplane.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one fragment of this whole event I can't remember is
pulling the handles,'' the pilot said in an account the Air Force
released this week, withholding his name at the aviator's request.
``God took my hands and pulled.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven hours later, a daring commando team snatched the downed
pilot from the hiding place to which he parachuted behind enemy
lines, and whisked him back to allied hands, first in Bosnia, then
in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   With the wreckage of the $43 million plane now in Yugoslav
hands, some questions may never be answered satisfactorily. And, of
course, there are competing theories of what happened:
</P>
<P>
   That a barrage of ground fire or an SA-6 missile, not an SA-3,
scored a lucky hit. All would have produced what look like bullet
holes in the wing wreckage that was shown on Serbian television.
</P>
<P>
   That the pilot, frustrated by dense clouds, took a chance and
flew his jet-black plane under 15,000 feet, only to be silhouetted
against the dull gray evening sky by an eerie glow from ground fire
reflecting off the cloud ceiling. Or that a bomb-bay door stuck
open, making the F-117 vulnerable to radar. But officials closest
to the investigation have discounted or ruled out these theories.
</P>
<P>
   A malfunction seems unlikely, industry officials say, because
the plane's manufacturer, Lockheed Martin, and its fabled Skunk
Works development center in Burbank, Calif., have not yet been
consulted by the Pentagon. Lockheed referred all questions to the
Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   Some Air Force officers are also upset that NATO did not bomb
the wreckage to prevent the plane's secrets from falling into
hostile hands. Pentagon officials have tried to discount this fear,
saying the F-117's technology is more than 20 years old, and less
sophisticated than that of its larger cousin, the B-2 bomber.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say that it appears the F-117 may have flown on
autopilot after the pilot ejected, and made a more or less
controlled landing, pancaking into a field. That may be why such
large portions of the plane, including its wing, were visible. If
the Nighthawk had landed nose first at high speed, it would have
been a smoldering ruin, these officials say.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Air Force and NATO commanders do not appear overly
concerned. After the downing, commanders issued stern verbal
warnings to F-117 pilots to keep alert. But Gen. Wesley K. Clark,
the Supreme Commander of NATO forces, requested, and was granted,
an additional 13 F-117s.
</P>
<P>
   ``When flown in its operating envelope, above 15,000 feet and
outside of huge acquisition radars, the F-117 is still difficult,
if not impossible, to see on a SAM radar until it's too late to do
anything about it,'' said Gen. John Michael Loh, who was the Air
Force vice chief of staff during the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the fighter has assumed an almost mystical reputation
since the war, when F-117s flew more than 1,250 missions, including
all the riskiest runs over downtown Baghdad. None of the Nighthawks
suffered even a scratch.
</P>
<P>
   And in the skies over Yugoslavia, the F-117s have even more help
than they did in the gulf. The plane's angular design and composite
skin are meant to deflect or absorb searching radar beams, and
offset its relative lack of speed (it's subsonic) and
maneuverability.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the anti-radiation missiles, the Air Force is for the
first time using a new, advanced radar-jamming system. Unlike
conventional electronic jammers, which radar operators can detect,
the new technology remotely injects signals into the radar that are
not evident to the operator on the ground, and can hinder the
missile's accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   For these reasons, senior Pentagon officials say Yugoslav forces
are essentially using a point-and-shoot method for firing missiles
now, rather than risk turning on their radars.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Boeing Co. and four airlines are seeking an
exemption from government rules, so the company's 777 jet can fly
farther from land. The purpose is to allow the plane, which has two
engines, to fly across the Pacific even when emergency airfields
along the route are closed by bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   The effort has created a dispute with Airbus, Boeing's only
major competitor and a proponent of four-engine planes, as well as
a re-evaluation by safety experts of whether it is still
appropriate to set safety rules governing oceanic flights based on
how many engines a plane has.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not so sure that makes a lot of sense,'' Chet Ekstrand, a
Boeing vice president, said of the rules. ``The vast majority of
reasons for diverting have nothing to do with engines.''
</P>
<P>
   The most frequent, Ekstrand said, are passenger illness.
</P>
<P>
   But John Leahy, senior vice president for sales at Airbus, said
in a recent briefing for Wall Street analysts that twin-engine
planes might be adequate for the Atlantic but not the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can put the North Atlantic and two continents into the
Pacific and there is still water to spare,'' Leahy said.
</P>
<P>
   Delta, Continental, American and United Air Lines asked the
Federal Aviation Administration last month for the change, which
would allow the 777 jets to make flights of up to nearly three and
a half hours from emergency airfields instead of the current
three-hour limit. The agency is considering the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a level of safety afforded by 180 minutes today,''
Tom McSweeny, the agency's associate administrator for aircraft
certification, said in an interview. ``If somebody wants to
entertain more than 180 minutes, they have to propose to us what
level of safety they want to meet, and we have to agree with
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilots union at American Air Lines, the Allied Pilots
Association, asked the agency to reject the request, or at least to
hold public hearings on it. The union said that the farther from an
airport an airplane gets, the greater the risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pilot has interests coincident with the passenger's,''
said Richard Lavoy, president of the union. ``We're on board with
them, not sitting in either a government office or a corporate
office, calculating risk.''
</P>
<P>
   But a larger union, the Air Line Pilots Association, backs the
change, partly because the airlines are volunteering to a variety
of other steps to reduce risk. For example, the airlines have
agreed to eliminate rules that let planes fly even if a fuel gauge
is broken or if the auxiliary power unit, an extra jet engine for
making electricity, is not working.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The issue is also focusing attention on the uncertain future of
remote airports in the Pacific, no longer needed for refueling
stops or strategic assets in the Cold War. The Navy pulled out of
Midway Island and gave it to the Fish and Wildlife Service in April
1997. The Air Force gave up another field, near the western end of
the Aleutians, in March 1995. Both airstrips are now run by
contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Before the jet era, the aviation agency required two-engine
planes to stay within an hour's flying time of a suitable airfield,
but in 1985, accepting the airlines' arguments that jets fail only
one-tenth as often as piston engines, the agency extended that to
as much as two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the airlines wanted more flexibility as they stopped
funneling most international passengers through gateways like New
York and London and started flying through smaller places like
Pittsburgh and Birmingham, Ala. Traffic on those routes helped
build a market for smaller two-engine planes.
</P>
<P>
   To allow planes like that to fly across the Atlantic, the
aviation agency in 1988 approved flights of up to three hours from
emergency landing sites. And soon after the twin-engine 777 was
introduced in 1995, it qualified for the three-hour rule.
</P>
<P>
   But three hours, enough to allow 757s and 767s to cross the
Atlantic without going far out of their way to stay close to
Newfoundland or Iceland, is sometimes not enough for the Pacific.
If two or three airports in Alaska or Siberia are closed by bad
weather, the three-hour limit would be exceeded by four to 11
minutes, about 28 to 77 miles, for the 777. For the 777, three
hours is 1,260 miles; the airlines are seeking 1,450 miles.
</P>
<P>
   United Air Lines wants to begin flying its 777s to Tokyo from
San Francisco this year. To avoid a more southerly route that could
stretch the trip from San Francisco to 12{ hours from 11, it would
need those extra minutes to reach an airfield.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy, the Airbus official, said: ``If you lose an engine on a
quad, you have an annoying situation. If you lose an engine on a
twin, you have an emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ekstrand, the Boeing official, said that the longer flying
times to emergency sites were manageable by the 777 and that
problems on the plane were extremely rare. Based on 1998 operating
statistics, he said, if a 777 flew about three times every two
days, it would have to make an unscheduled landing once every 87
years.
</P>
<P>
   United Air Lines said that since 1986, when it began flights
across the Pacific, its planes have diverted only three times, each
time because of a sick passenger.

   BLACE, Macedonia _ Serbian forces are hunting down ethnic
Albanians hiding in woods and villages in southeastern Kosovo and
herding them into Urosevac, a sizable town roughly 30 miles from
the Macedonian border, refugees arriving from Kosovo said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the roughly 100 Kosovo Albanians who managed to cross
into Macedonia Saturday said that about 5,000 ethnic Albanians are
in Urosevac, where they reportedly live under a strict 7 p.m.-to-7
a.m. curfew and face shortages of food.
</P>
<P>
   Heavily armed Serb civilians patrol the streets of the town, and
some Albanians are ordered to leave their doors open for spot
police checks, some of the refugees said. Their accounts could not
be independently confirmed because foreign journalists, aid workers
and monitors were expelled or evacuated from Kosovo just after NATO
bombing began on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the ethnic Albanians in Urosevac are unsure whether to
stay or to flee, refugees who talked to reporters said. Many stores
have been looted, they added. This means that ethnic Albanians who
have stayed in their homes, and new arrivals hounded from the
countryside into the town are forced to live in abandoned homes and
rely on dwindling stocks in kitchens, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have anything to eat back there!'' Idiriz Sejeva, a
35-year-old refugee shouted to reporters from a bus window just
after crossing the border where Macedonian guards organized the
refugees' departure for what officials said were refugee camps.
``There are a lot of soldiers! You can't even go buy bread! There
is no food!''
</P>
<P>
   Ramiz Ramadani, a 52-year-old teacher, expressed frustration
with the lack of aid for people trapped in the province. ``No one
is doing anything about the refugees in Kosovo,'' Ramadani said.
``At least get them some food by helicopter or at least let them
come here.''
</P>
<P>
   Western officials and the U.N. refugee agency have expressed
strong concern about the fate of hundreds of thousands of ethnic
Albanians still in Kosovo. Food drops have been considered, but
rejected as too dangerous for the NATO pilots who would have to fly
low to make the drops, risking Serbian anti-aircraft fire. There
would also be no guarantee of the food reaching the ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Ramadani said that Serbian forces came to his small village near
Urosevac several days after NATO's air campaign began and told the
villagers they would be safe. But the following day another group
of soldiers arrived and residents fled in fear, he said. The
soldiers killed five elderly people, including two confined to
wheelchairs, he said, and looted and burned homes.
</P>
<P>
   He said he, his wife and three sons fled into the hills with
other villagers, but they were captured by Serbian soldiers.
Jewelry was taken from some of the women and the group was ordered
to enter Urosevac.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were all empty houses and no food,'' he said. ``The Serb
civilians, even the kids, were carrying machine guns.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even though the curfew allowed him to walk the streets between 7
a.m. and 7 p.m., Ramadani said he only dared venture outside twice
in the town. He was told that the border was closed but he also
heard that trains to Macedonia were running.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving early this morning with a few dozen other people from
the town, he boarded a nearly empty train for the border. Serbian
police, who earlier this week reportedly forced refugees back into
Kosovo as President Slobodan Milosevic declared a ceasefire, tried
to talk Ramadani's group out of leaving, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The police urged the group to turn back, and said the only way
into Macedonia was to walk down railroad tracks mined on either
side, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half of our group turned back,'' he said. ``They were
scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramadani and his family headed down the tracks. Upon arrival,
they waited several hours to be processed by the Macedonian police
before being taken to join the 18,000 other refugees in a sprawling
refugee camp built by British NATO soldiers in the town of Brazde.
</P>
<P>
   Sejeva, a longtime resident of Urosevac, said that he fled into
the woods from his home in the town when NATO bombing began, but
returned to the town several days later when his pregnant wife
needed medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Four days ago, Serb soldiers raided the small tent area in the
woods where he and his wife initially hid, and the couple decided
to trek through the woods, hoping to get to Macedonia. He and a few
dozen others who made it were held by Macedonian police when they
arrived this morning before being bused out.
</P>
<P>
   Genc Rexha, a 28-year-old architecture student who also lived in
Urosevac, recounted a life of horror in the town that, if true, is
reminiscent of tactics used by Serb paramilitaries in the 1992-95
war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Rexha, who arrived with Ramadani, said that houses of local
Albanian leaders were targeted for destruction. Albanians were
dragged into the street by masked men and then forced to watch as
their homes were looted, he said. And last Friday, Serbs shot dead
a young Albanian for no apparent reason as he walked down the
street at 1:30 p.m., Rexha said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people are getting ready to try to escape,'' he
said. ``But they don't know the way. They are scared.''

<P>
   BLOOMFIELD HILLS, Mich. _ For two decades, Richard Callaghan and
Craig Maurizi worked together in the sport of international figure
skating. Callaghan was first Maurizi's coach, then his colleague,
and the two together coached some of the most promising skaters in
the United States. They enjoyed considerable success.
</P>
<P>
   Having begun working with Callaghan when he was 13, Maurizi rose
through the ranks of pairs skating to finish fifth at the 1986
national championships. And in 1998, with Maurizi assisting
Callaghan, Tara Lipinski won the Olympic gold medal in Nagano,
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, Maurizi has come forward to claim that his
relationship with Callaghan, one of the dominant figures in
skating, was much more complicated, even exploitative.
</P>
<P>
   Maurizi, 36, who has recently embarked on his own as a coach and
taken Lipinski with him, has said in a series of interviews in
recent weeks that Callaghan engaged in inappropriate sexual conduct
with him when he was 15, and later abused his position of authority
to initiate a full sexual relationship when Maurizi was 18 and
barely out of high school. The sexual relationship, Maurizi claims,
continued, off and on, until two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Maurizi, who never reported any misconduct by Callaghan during
the 21 years of their collaboration and friendship, registered a
complaint last month with the U.S. Figure Skating Association. He
said he had only recently been able to talk about his sexual
relationship with Callaghan, and had, with the help of a therapist
and the support of his wife, come to the conclusion that the
relationship had been wrong, and that Callaghan needed to be
investigated.
</P>
<P>
   Callaghan, who has retained a lawyer, vehemently denied that he
ever had sex with Maurizi and dismissed any suggestion that he had
engaged in any improper behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent, four-hour interview here at his lawyer's office,
Callaghan contended that Maurizi's charges were part of an effort
to rob him of his skaters and thus enhance his former protege's
professional and financial standing. Maurizi and Callaghan
separated as coaching colleagues last year after a tense Olympic
season, with Lipinski choosing to work with Maurizi.
</P>
<P>
   Maurizi, referring to his years with Callaghan, said: ``At the
time, I thought the sex was consensual. Now, when I look back, I
don't think it was consensual. I don't care how old a student is,
whether it's a boy or a girl, a coach should never have sex with a
student. The coach is the person the athlete looks up to for
leadership and to be a role model. I don't think coaches understand
the influence they can exert over students. People need to be more
aware of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Disbrow, president of the U.S. Figure Skating Association,
said that Maurizi informed him last month of his allegations
against Callaghan, but added that the association would not act
until it received a formal written grievance. Maurizi said he
planned to submit his written complaint within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Callaghan, 53, who is married with a grown daughter, resigned as
director of competitive skating at the Detroit Skating Club in
early March and said he planned to retire from the competitive side
of the sport. Callaghan's decision _ he plans to continue serving
as a consultant to his skaters _ surprised the skating world, for
he is the most successful coach in the country, having produced an
Olympic champion, two world champions and seven national titles.
</P>
<P>
   Callaghan said his resignation was unrelated to the allegations
made by Maurizi, and was instead the result of having, after 27
years, grown weary of the relentless travel and daily grind of
international coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked my butt off to be successful,'' Callaghan said. ``I
think I've got the right to cut back. I'm proud of what I've
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with four dozen skaters, coaches, officials, agents
and parents, including more than a dozen of Callaghan's current and
former students, have produced differing portraits: For some, he is
a consummate, if tough and exacting, professional; for others, he
is an authoritarian presence who could bully female skaters and
make unwanted sexual advances to male skaters under his care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, he has done so much for my career,'' Todd Eldredge,
27, said of Callaghan. Eldredge, who has worked with Callaghan
since he was in elementary school, has won five national titles and
was world champion in 1996. Eldredge said that across two decades
of work with Callaghan he had seen no evidence of misconduct of any
kind. ``He's been like a father figure,'' Eldredge said. ``His
style is that he wants things right. He'll push you to get the
results he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   But Eddy Zeidler, 28, a former student, said Callaghan exposed
himself to him in a hotel room in 1992. And Roman Fraden, 24,
another former student, said that Callaghan made inappropriate
sexual remarks to him in 1994, and Fraden's parents said they
confronted Callaghan over the remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Agle, who coached with Callaghan in Philadelphia in the
early 1980s, said that three different male skaters approached her
in 1986 and said they had witnessed or been subjected to sexual
advances by Callaghan. And the former managers of the San Diego
rink where Callaghan worked in the early 1990s said two young
skaters complained in 1991 that they had witnessed Callaghan
kissing an adult male student during a workout at the rink.
</P>
<P>
   The managers ultimately sided with Callaghan, believing the
girls or their coach might have misconstrued what they saw or made
up the story.
</P>
<P>
   One thing, though, is sure: no formal complaint has ever before
been filed against Callaghan for any kind of misconduct. Officials
with the figure skating association said Maurizi's allegations were
the first of their kind. Officials at private rinks in Buffalo,
N.Y.; Philadelphia; Colorado Springs, Colo.; San Diego, and
Detroit, where Callaghan has worked, said he never left any job as
a result of concerns over improper behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Callaghan, for his part, said some of his former students were
attempting to blame him for unfulfilled careers. Zeidler, he said,
left Detroit owing him and the skating club several thousand
dollars, a claim confirmed by Drew Paterson, a former president of
the club.
</P>
<P>
   Callaghan said that he made no inappropriate remarks to Fraden,
and that Fraden's parents never raised the issue with him. Of
Agle's allegation, he said it was consistent with a pattern of
unfounded claims made against him over the years. Regarding the San
Diego incident, Callaghan said he was choreographing a routine for
an upcoming competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``For whatever reasons I don't understand, people love me or
hate me,'' Callaghan said. ``I have no clue why. In almost 30
years, I've taught about 500 kids. I don't understand this. The
allegations are awful. I can't believe I worked my butt off for
kids to be successful in skating to be better people, and this
stuff happens.''

 BLOOMFIELD HILLS: stuff happens.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The son of a fencing salesman from Rochester, N.Y., Callaghan
began skating at age 9 or 10. He showed a rare versatility,
competing in singles, pairs and ice dancing. He finished fifth at
the national championships in 1965 at age 19, and then toured with
the Ice Capades and Holiday on Ice shows for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Always, though, he wanted to teach. ``I protected myself, so I
would be able to teach whoever walked in the door,'' he said,
referring to his preparations to master different aspects of figure
skating.
</P>
<P>
   As with gymnastics, many figure skaters leave home as
adolescents to take lessons from the best coaches, sometimes moving
with one or both parents, sometimes moving alone. A skater might
spend four hours a day practicing, and with frequent travel to
competitions coaches can essentially become guardians, chaperons
and advisers as well as shapers of careers.
</P>
<P>
   Maurizi began taking lessons from Callaghan as a 13-year-old in
1976 in Buffalo. What began with simple lessons between coach and
student, Maurizi says, evolved into a long, complex partnership
that included success on the ice and an unhealthy, but effectively
unbreakable relationship off it. Maurizi, over the years, took
lessons with his coach in Buffalo, Philadelphia and Colorado
Springs, and later coached with him in San Diego and Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Callaghan moved with his family from Buffalo to work in
Philadelphia, and Maurizi, then 18, followed him, as skaters often
do with their coaches. It was there, Maurizi said, that the
relationship with Callaghan became sexual, and their encounters
occurred at his own apartment, at Callaghan's home, in hotel rooms
and at a skating rink, usually after nights of drinking.
</P>
<P>
   The skater said that he felt uncomfortable, but that his fear of
disappointing Callaghan overcame his sense that something was not
right.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, when he was 23 and had moved to Colorado Springs to
continue taking lessons with Callaghan, Maurizi said he told his
coach he was uncomfortable with the sexual relationship and wanted
it to end, but that Callaghan interfered with his attempts to date
women. It was not until 1989, when he met his wife, Chaundra, that
he had a steady girlfriend, Maurizi said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had the guts,'' Maurizi said in explaining why he
never broke from Callaghan until last winter. ``I didn't want to
experience his wrath, or hurt him. I still feel some remnants of
that today.''
</P>
<P>
   Since he left Callaghan, Maurizi said, he has been able to tell
his wife and certain friends about the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Callaghan said he believed that Maurizi, having already taken
Lipinski, is making the accusations to lure other skaters and gain
bigger paydays. Lipinski's parents said she left Callaghan because
they felt she was not getting adequate attention and because he had
become intrusive in trying to dictate all aspects of Lipinski's
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Groulx, Callaghan's lawyer, said: ``Mr. Maurizi has
certainly not enjoyed the coaching success that Richard has. Until
a short time ago, he was making significantly less than $100,000 a
year. Now, by swaying certain prominent members of the Detroit
Skating Club through these allegations to come under his tutelage,
he has the opportunity to earn upwards of $250,000 a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Maurizi said he told Callaghan on Feb. 19 at the Detroit Skating
Club that he had begun to speak openly of their relationship. He
said Callaghan blamed him for being the aggressor in the
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was extremely sad and disappointing to me,'' Maurizi
said. ``He seemed to be blaming me. It was an awful thing to
hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Callaghan denied the subject ever came up and said the meeting
had been amicable.

CHINESE VISITOR PLAYS TO THE MANY AUDIENCES IN U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Fla., Calif.) (lb) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Chinese leaders, tutored by their own experts and
legions of ``foreign friends'' who pass through Beijing, have
learned a lesson over the years: The United States is not a
one-party dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Simple though it sounds, it has taken the Chinese government the
better part of the quarter-century to digest that fact. The United
States, especially when it comes to the volatile subject of China,
is not one state, but 50. It has 435 political factions, each with
its own seat in the House of Representatives. The media, academia
and the corporate world rarely toe the ``party'' line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to believe that if your president and our leaders can
trust one another, then there is no problem,'' said a Chinese
Foreign Ministry official in the delegation of the visiting Chinese
prime minister. ``That is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   This has led to the remarkable spectacle of Prime Minister Zhu
Rongji, trained in the Communist Party system, cajoling members of
Congress, rallying businesses, courting the media, and now, as he
brings his whistle-stop tour of America to Denver, taking his case
to the American people.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu, though deeply disappointed that he was unable to seal a
deal for China's entry into the World Trade Organization last week,
hoped but never assumed that President Clinton would deliver on the
trade deal that the two sides have been negotiating in recent
weeks, senior Chinese aides said in interviews on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Especially given what they describe as the ``bad political
environment'' in relation to China these days, Zhu and his advisers
felt that even if the accord was signed, the prime minister would
still have to ``campaign'' vigorously to help Clinton get it
through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The idea marks a sea change in the way China deals with the
United States. Chinese officials have long lamented that their fine
working relationships with presidents, dating back to Richard
Nixon, often do not ensure stable relations.
</P>
<P>
   Now China is trying to build bridges to a more diverse group of
U.S. political and business leaders. The campaign seems unlikely to
generate a public groundswell of support to get China into the
trade group. But for the Chinese strategy to work, Zhu need not
necessarily do that, his aides say. It is enough to persuade a
cross-section of political, media and academic leaders that the
United States can do business with China, and specifically with
Zhu.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister quipped at his joint news conference with
Clinton on Thursday that he is a neophyte in the glare of media
spotlights in Washington. But he appears not only to tolerate the
rough and tumble of American politics but also to enjoy it, showing
off his ability to make jokes and speak off the cuff.
</P>
<P>
   The apparently tireless 70-year-old Zhu, unruffled despite
several late-night strategy sessions and a brutal travel schedule,
delved into environmental policy at a forum with Vice President Al
Gore on Friday. The prime minister pointedly departed from his
prepared text to detail environmental problems in China, moments
after Gore, who is campaigning for president, delivered remarks on
the subject read verbatim from a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   Then, late into the evening, Zhu spoke extemporaneously and took
questions from an audience of China scholars and diplomats at a
Washington hotel, expounding at length on his disappointment over
the failure to close the trade deal. He sounded crestfallen at
times, even suggesting that he could suffer politically at home for
compromising too much. But the audience loved the performance,
which seemed to be the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I went back to China and talked about all these concessions
I have made, I could be kicked out of office,'' Zhu said, a slight
grin suggesting that he is confident this is not about to happen.
``The problem is not that I am afraid of this, but that the Chinese
people will never accept too many concessions.''
</P>
<P>
   It is almost as though Zhu, in a role reversal, wants to
negotiate the trade accord in public while his U.S. counterparts
prefer to settle matters privately. He warned his dinner audience
that the concessions China has made to date are not set in stone
until the two sides agree on an interim joint statement, a matter
he says is still not final despite U.S. suggestions to the
contrary.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Like any campaigner, Zhu is careful to praise his friends.
Speaking of greatly expanded opportunities for foreign insurance
companies in China if it joins the world trade group, he recalled
the pioneering experiences of Maurice Greenberg, chairman of
insurance giant American International Group, who received the
first foreign license to sell policies in Shanghai, China, years
ago. Then he joked that he had received ``no favors'' from
Greenberg in exchange for this privileged access to the China
market.
</P>
<P>
   At times, he has laid bare the strategy for his U.S. visit.
Speaking in Chinese to a group of Chinese-Americans last week, he
played on the Chinese word ``qi,'' which, depending on context, can
mean ``anger'' or ``morale.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that amid allegations about Chinese human rights abuses
and spying, the best he could expect on this trip was to reduce the
``qi'' that many Americans felt toward China by accepting their
criticism. Then he added, his voice rising, that he also hoped to
increase the ``qi'' of all Chinese-Americans, calling on them to
help promote better bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Zhu seems almost to be engaging in his own version of
pork-barrel politics. He agreed to separate from the trade
negotiations a side accord liberalizing Chinese import rules for
U.S. wheat and citrus fruit. The reason: California and Florida,
two of the most important states politically, are big citrus
exporters.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Alcee Hastings, D-Fla., seemed to validate that tactic.
Hastings, who had breakfast with Zhu at Blair House on Friday
morning, said the citrus agreement solved his biggest requirement
for China's entry into the trade group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that we need to hammer away at them all the
time,'' Hastings said. ``Congress should stop looking for demons.''
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister's performance is by no means perfect. Several
people who watched his news conference with Clinton, for instance,
faulted him for referring to Abraham Lincoln and the U.S. Civil War
as an analogy for China's policy toward Taiwan, an off-the-cuff
remark that sounded aggressive and prompted a rebuke from Clinton.
Several others said he appeared unwilling to engage in serious
discussion about human rights, despite promises to do so.
</P>
<P>
   But halfway through his U.S. tour, some China experts are
comparing Zhu to Chou En-lai, the prime minister who served loyally
at Mao Tse-tung's side before and after the communist revolution.
Like Chou, Zhu focuses on carrying out policy effectively, not
debating ideology. And like Chou, Zhu is rapidly becoming the
public face of China, at least to the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is selling himself as the intelligent, sophisticated, Chou
En-lai guy,'' said James Lilley, a former ambassador to China.
``He's post-Tiananmen square, Shanghai not Beijing, economic
reform, free market, MIT and science and all that. All very
effective.''

 &HT;    Exodus of GIs created winners, losers in La.
 &HT;    By Matt Kempner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEESVILLE, La. _ Despite its best efforts, this GI town isn't
utopia yet.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty years after a group of Californians founded a large
commune here and promised members equal pay and equal social
opportunities, Leesville is a town in search of economic equality
with growing Southern communities.
</P>
<P>
   The New Llano commune lasted just 20 years. A U.S. Army base
here has survived longer, but it has never been particularly
reliable. It opened and closed often enough to flood the town with
soldiers preparing for World War II and wars in Korea and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Leesville is struggling again. True, the regular Wal-Mart
was upgraded to a Super Wal-Mart and a mobile home manufacturer
started operations in town. But houses, bars, shops and a mobile
home park are abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Polk _ still far and away the biggest employer in Leesville
and Vernon Parish _ remains open. But by early 1993, the Army base
had shipped out half of its 16,000 soldiers. Vernon Parish lost one
in six of its residents.
</P>
<P>
   Proprietors of mom-and-pop stores found they didn't have enough
work to keep their counter help. With fewer military kids in
school, the government laid off teachers. Requests for emergency
assistance to buy groceries and pay rent rose by more than a third.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is afraid to borrow and invest capital because it is
so uncertain right now,'' said Ron Steed, who is president of both
the Merchants &AMP; Farmers Bank and the local chamber of commerce. At
home, he is comforted by the sounds of shots fired during training
maneuvers at the nearby base. ``That's good to hear. You know they
are still there.''
</P>
<P>
   While much of the South booms with growth, the trend has been
lopsided. Some communities lost population in the 1990s. Heavily
represented among them are military communities that have had to
recreate their economies after base closings and cutbacks of the
1980s and 1990s. But not all such communities are hurting.
</P>
<P>
   Central Louisiana suffered two whacks in the military
dice-and-slice. Leesville lost half the troop strength at Fort
Polk. And 50 miles away, across bayous and pine forests, the larger
city of Alexandria lost everyone at England Air Force Base. The
installation closed in late 1992, taking with it 3,000 military
personnel and 1,000 civilian jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps to the surprise of the people who still live there,
Alexandria appears to be better off without them.
</P>
<P>
   In six years, the community's total number of jobs is up, not
down. Economists and locals agree the city is economically
healthier than it was. The U.S. Department of Defense highlights
Alexandria as proof that communities don't have to be doomed when
tanks, ships and fighter wings leave.
</P>
<P>
   With 50,000 residents, Alexandria is the biggest economic center
in a central Louisiana landscape dominated by pine trees and cotton
and soybean farms.
</P>
<P>
   But to understand the plight that faced Alexandria, you have to
understand what the city isn't.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't particularly close to New Orleans. Or Baton Rouge. Or
Shreveport. It isn't on the Mississippi River. It isn't sitting on
oceans of easily accessible oil. And, up until recently, it wasn't
on an interstate.
</P>
<P>
   That changed just as the base was closing. Road crews began work
on sections of Interstate 49 through Alexandria, pumping new jobs
into the community. When the highway was completed, it spurred new
restaurants and gas stations and helped local officials trying to
attract new industry.
</P>
<P>
   But the city's successes weren't all happenstance. When locals
learned England Air Force Base might be among those closed, leaders
broke into two groups. One worked on plan A, which was to lobby to
keep the base open. The second worked secretly on plan B, which was
to figure out a way to reuse the base if it closed.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials persuaded the federal government to give the
base to a new state-created regional authority. Next, the authority
persuaded the federal government to pay it to temporarily maintain
the base after it closed _ giving local officials a chance to learn
on the job how to run a 2,500-acre complex with nearly 500
buildings, 600 houses and apartment units, and a runway long enough
to handle 747s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started out just trying to keep the grass cut and the
lights on,'' said Jon Grafton, Alexandria's former city clerk who
now serves as executive director of the authority overseeing the
complex.
</P>
<P>
   The glass doors to his offices still carry the logo of the 23rd
Tactical Fighter Wing. It's from there that he makes this
pronouncement: ``Communities that have bases close have this
incredible asset and opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Now called the England Industrial Airpark &AMP; Community, the
former base is a weird mix of military base and industrial park.
Military homes have been turned into a new retirement community.
Hangars have been taken over by an aircraft repair company.
</P>
<P>
   There's an Internet service provider on base, a computer
manufacturer, a new call center, satellite classrooms for a local
university and other businesses. Officials also moved a regional
airport to use the base runways and increase the passenger load of
commuter airlines serving the community.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the military hasn't disappeared. The
Department of Defense pays $1.3 million annually to use its old
base to fly in thousands of troops 10 times a year for exercises at
Fort Polk in Leesville.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,600 people work at the park, and about a third of
the homes are occupied. But there also are vacant spaces. The base
movie theater opened up as a commercial operation, then closed.
Dormitory buildings and the base bowling alley sit mostly unused.
While leads for new industrial prospects have slowed, authority
officials have laid plans to embark on their first major
construction projects: A new 220-acre golf course and a new
terminal five times bigger than the current one.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Roy Jr., a personal injury lawyer in town, saw enough
positive signs last year to invest some of his personal fortune
into starting a professional ice hockey team at the Rapides Parish
Coliseum. The Alexandria Warthogs _ named after the aircraft once
based at England _ are both a salute to the base and proof that the
city has moved on, Roy says. ``We've become more self-reliant as a
community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Across from the coliseum, at Connie's bar, proprietor Connie
Stilley braced for devastation after the Air Force base closed.
Instead, she said, ``I make more money now than I ever did.''
</P>
<P>
   She concludes that base personnel spent most of their money at
the base. ``Bases are just about self-sufficient. They don't need
the community really and truly.'' And Alexandria, she said, has
learned it didn't really need the base.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty miles away, the city of Leesville can't draw the same
conclusion about Fort Polk.

   ``Our biggest industry here is Wal-Mart. Does that tell you
anything?'' said Renee Brannon, who oversees programs development
at the Vernon Community Action Council in Leesville.
</P>
<P>
   Limited opportunities is the price of being in not just a small
town, but one that has lost population, she said. Students with
good grades leave for college and never come back.
</P>
<P>
   Some local leaders are looking for economic diversification
beyond the military. They are marketing land to industries and have
pushed for a four-lane connection to I-49 in Alexandria. But the
efforts were slow to take off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of old heads that made a fortune here on the
military, and they didn't want to change,'' said Ron Steed, who for
12 years has been president at the Merchants &AMP; Farmers Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have forgotten the smokestacks and taken care of the green
suits,'' he said. ``That's where we have fallen down.''

 &HT;    Eat more bison? Industry faces a hard sell
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ No, it doesn't taste like chicken and it certainly
doesn't look like it.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking bison, an animal that Ted Turner is trying to
establish as a healthy culinary alternative to beef.
</P>
<P>
   It's an uphill fight, but what else is new for Turner, who
helped build the cable TV industry with his TBS and CNN news
channels.
</P>
<P>
   As with his cable TV company, Turner's bison operation will
succeed only if the country's small and struggling bison industry
does, too. That means, once again, Turner must build an industry to
support his fledgling company.
</P>
<P>
   R.E. ``Teddy'' Turner Jr. heads his father's bison marketing
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Turner estimates his bison operations are already
among the largest in market value and herd size. While a tough sell
now, he is convinced bison can work as a business. ``Bison are more
profitable than cattle right now. Cattle prices have fallen sharply
while those for bison are going up.''
</P>
<P>
   While it looks like beef, bison meat differs in makeup and
taste. Bison is almost as lean as turkey and is best served rare.
Most restaurants overcook bison, which tastes wonderfully sweet
when prepared correctly. It's more expensive than beef, typically
two or three times higher in price.
</P>
<P>
   The market
</P>
<P>
   Today, naturalists consider bison the proper term for this
woolly range denizen. Buffalo refers to a cattlelike species that
lives in parts of Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, there are about 250,000 bison herded for commercial
meat. The number is growing by about 20 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
   But the bison market is small compared with that for beef. About
20,000 bison a year are slaughtered for meat compared with 120,000
cattle a day.
</P>
<P>
   Turner has about 17,000 bison on nine of his 16 U.S. properties.
He expects to grow his herds to 30,000 by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The bison operations are part of Atlanta-based Turner
Enterprises Inc., a private company. Turner sells his marketable
bison, mostly male calves, to the North American Bison Cooperative.
He owns 10 percent of the cooperative, which was formed to pool
industry supply and set common quality standards.
</P>
<P>
   The cooperative slaughters and packages the bison, but the
marketing of the product is left to the individual companies. For
Turner, that company is U.S. Bison Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a sales and marketing company focused on the
Southeast,'' says Hansell Roddenbery, U.S. Bison's president and
chief executive. Teddy Jr. is chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Roddenbery explains that U.S. Bison doesn't buy meat from
Turner's ranches but from the cooperative. In that way, ``we are
helping all the members of the cooperative.'' Right now, Turner's
ranches aren't big cooperative contributors because his bison are
young and not producing many marketable calves.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a long-term investment,'' says Teddy. ``It won't be
profitable for the first couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge
</P>
<P>
   Developing the commercial market is a major hurdle. There's good
demand for bison steaks in fancy restaurants. But demand for lesser
cuts such as hamburger and hot dogs is almost nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   That's a problem because most of the 400 pounds of meat from a
bison are better suited for hamburger and hot dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, 30 percent to 40 percent of all bison meat goes into
cold storage. ``It doesn't do us any good to keep pushing
tenderloin,'' says Teddy. ``Our job is to sell more hamburger.''
</P>
<P>
   Hot dogs and hamburger don't have steak's high profit margins so
Turner will have to sell a lot of bison hot dogs to become
profitable.
</P>
<P>
   While the plan is to eventually reach supermarkets, Teddy is
initially marketing to restaurants because people are more apt to
try something new when eating out.
</P>
<P>
   If people like a bison steak, he reasons, they'll be more likely
to buy the hamburger meat later on.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant effort is off to a strong start. Roddenbery, who
does the selling, is signing up restaurants weekly. Among those in
metro Atlanta are Nava, Jocks &AMP; Jills, the Downtown Capital Club,
the Ritz-Carlton Buckhead and downtown, the Marriott Marquis, the
Commerce Club and the Piedmont Driving Club.
</P>
<P>
   Roddenbery has also struck a deal with Turner Field, which is
now selling bison hot dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of places are sampling bison,'' says Teddy.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is Turner's famous name behind the product.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got Dad,'' says Teddy. ``That's a huge advantage. His
name is a marketer's dream.''

SPORTS COLUMN: A CROSSROADS MOMENT IN THE WNBA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)   By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long before she graduated from Notre Dame law school and worked
on both sides of the employee-relations street, Coquese Washington
understood the repercussions of a labor war. She grew up in Flint,
Mich., and her parents worked for General Motors, in rebellious
union shops. Her father went on strike. Her mother was laid off.
Families went broke. Familiar stores became boarded-up shells, and
her city the backdrop in ``Roger and Me,'' Michael Moore's bitterly
anti-corporate film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labor strife is nothing new to me,'' said the 28-year-old
backup point guard for the New York Liberty, knowing the fallout
may not be pretty, no matter how right you are.
</P>
<P>
   There are times when risks and odds must be ignored, when the
line in the sand, or on the hardwood, should be drawn. Now may be
one of them, because it happens to be a crossroads moment for women
in professional team sports. The 2-year-old Women's National
Basketball Association has all the leverage in its first collective
bargaining stare down. But the time has come to ask: Are the women
to be real players with legitimate jobs, or marketing pawns,
symbols of synergy, in the expansive universe of powerful men like
David Stern?
</P>
<P>
   ``We look upon this as a rite of passage,'' said Val Ackerman,
the WNBA president, handpicked for the position by Stern. ``Unions
are an accouterment of major-league sports. To that extent, it's
not a surprise we're in bargaining.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, after the way Stern dealt with the men, the
league's idea of bargaining has thus far been in the form of one
offer, take it or leave it, with a new round of talks scheduled to
begin Sunday or Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of retaliation, implicit or otherwise, begins with a
defunct league of very good players, potential scabs, waiting
outside the lines for another opportunity to work. The WNBA
veterans, Washington said, may not have much more than the moral
high ground to stand on, the rare sports union the public can't
call greedy. That is more than the men had in their recent
confrontation with Stern.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very mindful of the fact that this is a young league,''
Washington, a member of the women's negotiating team, said late
last week. ``But we also want some kind of commitment that shows
the players are as important as the marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   As a WNBA rookie last summer, Washington made the minimum,
$15,000. The American Basketball League paid her $40,000 the
previous season, a livable wage, but the ABL folded last December,
leaving Stern's annex as the only game around.
</P>
<P>
   The upstart rival crushed, the summertime concept proven to be
the best way to go, the ball is now with Ackerman and Stern. They
can push the players around, have it their way, or they can stop
throwing out optimistically averaged packages that are more
propaganda and move off their $20,000 minimum salary offer. They
can demonstrate that the advancement of the women's game is more to
them than a politically correct means of promoting the NBA name and
licensed products for 12 months a year.
</P>
<P>
   Winning with class means showing some compassion, allowing for a
negotiated settlement that will make the players rush back with a
smile. It is already unfortunate enough to have the WNBA players
fighting hard to limit the number of ABL players being signed.
Another $1 million into the pot _ what Stern uses to cater the
breakfast buffet at All-Star weekend _ would avoid the unseemly
prospect of ABL players walking past WNBA pickets.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, probably sooner, Darwin will win out. The most
gifted players will inherit the league. The WNBA, which has far
exceeded startup projections, will continue to grow, or it won't.
It should be obvious that the best chance it has to become an
indisputable revenue producer is to not make players exhaust
themselves all winter, playing in Europe and Asia, because they
can't make enough back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were told the whole idea was to create jobs in the States,
so we wouldn't have to go running all over the world to make enough
money to live,'' Washington said. ``People might say, `Get another
job.' How many jobs can you get where you pick up in May and say
you'll be back in October?''
</P>
<P>
   Washington practiced litigation and real-estate law for the New
York firm Rubin Baum Levin Constant &AMP; Friedman after last season.
She left in February, accepting the cold reality that the number of
jobs in the women's game was now half what it was.
</P>
<P>
   The players are smart enough to know that you do not go to a
competitive training camp after leading a sedentary 40-hour work
week, with executive lunches and a quick trip to the gym. Val
Ackerman and David Stern should know you don't grow a sport with a
handful of stars under personal-services contracts, while the rest
of the players get a stipend, not a salary.
</P>
<P>
   That is not promoting women's sports as much as it is convincing
people that the wrong league won.

 &HT;    Freaknik '99: Is the party ending or just changing?
 &HT;    By Ernie Suggs
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Freaknik '99 rolls into town this week, Andrea
Harvey will lock herself in her dorm room. She learned her lesson
four years ago while a junior at Cedar Grove High School in
Decatur.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to work at a drugstore in South DeKalb Mall,''
recalled Harvey, now a student at Agnes Scott College, where she is
student government president.
</P>
<P>
   What she saw in the mall's food court could easily have been a
scene from a strip club.
</P>
<P>
   Women were atop tables stripping, guys were groping and police
were arresting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy pulled me and asked if I was going to strip for
him,'' said Harvey. ``The more insistent he got, the larger the
group got.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, Harvey found herself surrounded by at least 40
guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``They engulfed me. Pulled my dress off. Groped me in places,''
said Harvey. ``I was pretty hysterical, but no one heard my
screams.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey said security rescued her, and she never reported the
assault to police or even talked about it for years because she was
embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   One thing she did do was avoid Freaknik.
</P>
<P>
   ``In theory, Freaknik was probably a very good idea,'' said
Harvey. ``But it has changed from what it was. Now, the general
atmosphere lends to behavior of disrespect and degradation.''
</P>
<P>
   Stories like Harvey's are what many people think about when
Freaknik, the 18-year-old spring break gathering for black college
students, comes to mind.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of spring break?
</P>
<P>
   Freaknik began in 1982, when a small group of Washington, D.C.
natives, who couldn't make it home from Atlanta colleges for spring
break, decided to have a picnic in the park. What started out
innocently has morphed into a roving and oftentimes unwieldy street
party, rife with images of sex and violence. ``Freaknik is a
mockery to our ancestors,'' said Eric Abercrumbie, director of the
African-American Cultural and Research Center at the University of
Cincinnati. ``They want to do things that are exciting to them or
on the edge, but it turns into an embarrassment. There are people
who have died so we can walk on the streets of Atlanta and they are
doing this on those very streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Some feel Abercrumbie's assessment is too harsh. They point out
that the arrests and reported assaults are minuscule, compared to
the number who attend.
</P>
<P>
   According to statistics provided by the Atlanta Police
Department, only a small percentage of Freaknik participants are
actually arrested during the event. In 1994, when Freaknik reached
its apex of 200,000 people, arrests totaled 143.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's gathering drew just 50,000 people, and fewer than
500 arrests were reported, not even 1 percent of the estimated
attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Most of what goes on at Freaknik may be typical of what goes on
at locations all over the country _ from Virginia Beach to Daytona
Beach to Venice Beach _ during spring break. As MTV has proved with
its spring break specials, students, white or black, are going to
trash hotel rooms, clog up intersections, get drunk and act rowdy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freaknik is looked at with more scrutiny because it is a black
event,'' said Robin Hughes, a 23-year-old native of Mobile, Ala.,
and a Clark Atlanta University graduate. ``But for the most part,
we have to accept some of the blame, because we do get out of hand.
There are some things that you just can't do in the middle of
downtown, and just because they do it doesn't mean that it is right
for us to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Brinson, a psychology professor at North Carolina Central
University, said Freaknik demonstrates the sudden and unpredictable
nature of crowds. Brinson said students and young adults may lead
regular, quiet lives at home, only to come to Atlanta to strip on
the roofs of cars or chase women down Auburn Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things start off innocently enough, then they turn violent. It
might have something to do with people trying to express their
frustration. Whatever that may be,'' Brinson said. ``It is a
complex, disturbing matter to me personally and professionally, and
it is played out almost daily in our court system when people cross
the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Brinson believes that unlike youth of the 1960s and 1970s, when
individuality was stressed, young people are now content with being
part of the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a security issue here,'' said Brinson. ``People go
along with this because there is protection in numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey said that when she was attacked in 1995, although most of
the faces were unfamiliar, she saw at least two people she knew
from high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't talk about it for a while,'' she said. ``Now, when
the discussion comes up, I'll talk about it. I don't know if I
would advise people not to go, but I would advise them on the
situation they put themselves in by just being there.''
</P>
<P>
   `With a name like Freaknik'
</P>
<P>
   Angel Crawford, a major with the Opa-locka (Fla.) Police
Department, gladly welcomes that kind of advice. She said she
hadn't really heard about Freaknik until her 20-year-old daughter
mentioned it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freaknik? I asked her what kind of spring break she was going
to with a name like Freaknik,'' said Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   She e-mailed a sorority sister in Atlanta to find out more. Now
her daughter, Porshe, will be staying home in Opalocka during
Freaknik, Crawford said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have concerns as a parent for a child that is going to go
away _ especially a young lady. When (my sorority sister) wrote me
and told me about the assaults and the type of women who come up
there, I said absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   Porshe Crawford said she and her friends were just looking for a
cool place to go for her first spring break as a college student.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard it was just people having fun . . . maybe sort of
wild. I didn't know it was about that,'' said the Broward Community
College freshman. ``Some of the things she was saying about some
girl getting stripped in the street, all those men, it appears to
be pretty wild. I didn't know it was to that extreme. I just
thought it was fun. It did change my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she won't attend Freaknik, she may attend the Black
College Reunion in Daytona Beach this weekend, one of two major
events, along with the Kappa Beach Party in Galveston, Texas, that
rival Freaknik for attendance by African-American college students.
</P>
<P>
   The events in Daytona Beach and Galveston may explain why
Freaknik attendance has dropped each year since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Abercrumbie cited numerous reasons for Freaknik's decline,
including poor planning and a lack of a significant adult
supervision. But there is an even more basic problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name started it and suggested the behavior,'' Abercrumbie
said. ``A new name and a new design would help. The cry is that
young people want something to do. How do you channel that in a
positive way? When you think of Freaknik, you want to see freaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Some are struggling to change that image. Although it is
commonly known as Freaknik, it is technically the Black College
Spring Break. Locals have voiced their concerns, and up to 500
Atlanta high school students will be wearing red ``Don't Freak No
Mo'' T-shirts during this year's event to show the city that not
everyone who attends Freaknik is a freak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freaknik, and what it has become, is an event that the city
and the citizens of the city do not welcome,'' said Atlanta native
Byron Amos, a newly appointed member of a municipal committee
examining the event. ``We are trying to convert Freaknik into Black
College Spring Break, which is a more productive and respectable
event.''
</P>
<P>
   Amos, a senior at Clark Atlanta University, said that in order
to do that, they will focus more on the positive side of the event,
like the accompanying Sweet Auburn Festival and job fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can bring that to light, we can overshadow some of the
negative,'' said Amos, 26.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that only the partyers can change the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really hard to get around the negatives. It all falls
back on the participants.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even if your NFL team yearns to draft a linebacker, a
cornerback or a wide receiver though your club may need a safety or
a tenacious tackle, its selectors cannot help but notice that one
position keeps surfacing this year like a life
preserver: &UR;  &LR; quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   It is a tempting lot. There are more high-quality quarterbacks
to choose from than in any recent NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   So many, in fact, that when the draft kicks off Saturday at the
Theater in Madison Square Garden, expect a record number of
quarterbacks to be taken in the first two rounds. There have never
been more than six selected in the first two rounds (in 1983, six
went in the first round and none in the second); this year there is
a solid chance that at least seven will be selected in rounds 1 and
2.
</P>
<P>
   There is a chance that the record of six quarterbacks selected
in the first round will be matched. And consider this: Quarterbacks
could be chosen with the first three picks, which has happened only
once, in 1971. Ponder the possibility that four of the top six
selections could be quarterbacks and that as many as 14 to 18 could
be drafted overall, compared with eight last year.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacks color the personalities of their teams. And
quarterbacks color the personality of the 64th NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``This draft is rich in quarterbacks, and the question is, What
is the quality of the wealth?'' said Carmen Policy, president of
the expansion Cleveland Browns, who own the No. 1 pick. ``Four of
the top six picks possibly being quarterbacks says a lot; that is
quite a number. But are they superstars, or busts? The hardest
position to project is the quarterback position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will sit down early next week and discuss all of the
information we have compiled and begin to make decisions. Our
people have worked around the clock. They are just worn out. But
they're supposed to be. It's draft time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could go the running back route and draft Ricky Williams.
We could make a trade, drop down and take a chance on one of
several quarterbacks. But the consensus is the top two quarterbacks
are Akili Smith and Tim Couch, and the proper order is up for
grabs. We are looking to fall in love. We've got our banking
account in order. We've got a fresh haircut. Our suit is on. We're
hoping to be smitten by one of these guys. And we want true love _
not a tawdry affair.''
</P>
<P>
   Policy wants a quarterback, a franchise quarterback, because the
previous 79 NFL seasons have showed that championships and Super
Bowls are not won without one.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few seasons ago, however, NFL teams were howling over the
dearth of good college quarterbacks. What changed?
</P>
<P>
   ``The college game has changed,'' said Ozzie Newsome, the
Baltimore Ravens' vice president for player personnel. ``College
football has gone to four and five wideouts. There is more of a
passing emphasis. It used to be that you could run, run, run on
offense and play defense and win a national championship. Now teams
like Florida State and coaches like Steve Spurrier have implemented
pro-style passing offenses, and others have followed suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Rich McKay, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' general manger, is
co-chairman of the league's competition committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was brought to us four years ago,'' he said. ``Teams asked
what could we do about developing quarterbacks in college? We
looked at the history of it and decided that half the teams every
year in the NFL lose. And quarterbacks get the blame. It is the
nature of the game and the position. But this is a very unusual
draft. People should enjoy this as far as the quarterbacks are
concerned because the way it might fall, well, it hasn't ever
happened before. And it may never happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Couch are joined by Donovan McNabb and Daunte
Culpepper as the projected quarterback elite. They will be the
first four selected. But what about the others?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some quarterbacks who can jump in and play, and
there are some who show some tools and need developing,'' said
Michael Huyghue, the Jacksonville Jaguars' senior vice president in
charge of football operations. ``There are some quarterbacks who
show natural intelligence, and others who exhibit football
intelligence. Those traits appeal to different people in different
ways.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Huyghue says to look for where Cade McNown of UCLA, Ted White of
Howard and Michael Bishop of Kansas State fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``McNown has been seen in a good offense,'' Huyghue said. ``He
played in an offense that put points on the board. He is athletic
and moves well. With White, the knock is he is from a small school,
but he is big, has the arm strength and is developing. A team is
going to take a chance on him and maybe find it was worth it.
Bishop is intriguing because he won. Give me a quarterback that won
games. That is one of the strongest selling points of the
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Green, the Minnesota Vikings' head coach, said that he
would continue to build his teams through the draft and that though
his team was quarterback rich, he would not rule out drafting
another one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anthony Wright from South Carolina _ his team wasn't very
good, but this guy might be,'' Green said. ``Brian Kuklick from
Wake Forest threw for a lot of yards. Joe Germaine out of Ohio
State is worth looking at; he is good enough to be a No. 3
quarterback and maybe can work his way higher. Shaun King at Tulane
won a lot of games. You can zero in on these guys and if you make
the right pick, you set your team on a steady stream.''

CRITICS SAY INMATES ARE SHACKLED IN CHILDBIRTH  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
 - PREGNANT-INMATES-775&AMP;ADD-NYT   By NINA SIEGAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nine years ago, after reports that pregnant inmates
were being kept in shackles during labor and delivery, a federal
court ordered the New York City Department of Correction to stop
the practice. It also prohibited the routine shackling of inmates
after they had given birth, requiring the department to consult a
physician before using restraints.
</P>
<P>
   But now, prisoners and their advocates say, female inmates who
are taken to Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens are again being
shackled routinely after giving birth, and, in some cases, during
delivery, in violation of the court decree.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International reported last month that in the first half
of 1998, six female inmates from Rikers Island had been shackled
while waiting to give birth, some of them during delivery. The
Prisoners' Rights Project of the Legal Aid Society, upon reviewing
recent Department of Correction records, which indicate a sharp
rise in the number of inmates shackled after delivery, has asked
the department to re-evaluate its restraint policy.
</P>
<P>
   Dori A. Lewis, a lawyer with the Prisoners' Rights Project,
which brought the suit that led to the court decree, said she hoped
that the city would respond to advocates' concerns. ``If not,'' she
said, ``various options are open to us, one of which is seeking
court intervention.''
</P>
<P>
   While a spokesman for the department, Thomas Antenen, defended
the use of restraints in hospital recovery rooms as a
``common-sense security practice,'' he emphatically denied that any
women had been restrained at Elmhurst during labor or delivery, and
called the Amnesty report ``inaccurate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't do it,'' he said. ``Once they go into the labor
room or the delivery room, any restraints they may have on them
would be removed, and that is policy.''
</P>
<P>
   But advocates say accounts by current and former inmates suggest
otherwise. In one example, Sabrina Jefferson, 28, of Mount Vernon,
N.Y., who served six months at Rikers for violating probation last
year, said she was left alone in a labor room at Elmhurst on April
26, 1998, with her left leg shackled to the bed and her hands
cuffed together. When her baby arrived, she said, she was unable to
reach the call button to summon a nurse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 3:41 a.m. when the baby came out,'' she said. ``When
the nurses and the doctor came into the room it was 3:45 a.m.
Nobody was there when I had the baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Another former inmate, Tanya L. Watson, 31, of Brooklyn, said
that when she gave birth to her son at Elmhurst in April 1996, just
27 days after her arrest on a charge of selling drugs, her leg and
wrist were shackled to the hospital bed throughout childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital and the Department of Correction would not discuss
either woman's case, saying patients' medical histories are
private.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates for inmates and human rights groups say the
accounts are troubling. ``It still happens,'' said the Rev. Annie
Bovian, executive director of Women's Advocate Ministry Inc., a
nonprofit group in Harlem, who interviewed inmates for the Amnesty
report.
</P>
<P>
   Some physicians say shackling presents serious health risks to
new mothers, including an increased likelihood of blood clotting,
which could lead to a pulmonary embolism, blocking lung function.
Robert L. Cohen, who was director of Rikers Island health services
from 1982 to 1986, said restraints should be used only if there are
no alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to care for prisoners in a hospital setting,
you maintain a secure area where there's no need for shackling,''
said Cohen, who is a member of the National Commission on
Correctional Health Care, a standard-setting group.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Elmhurst Hospital, unlike Bellevue Hospital Center in
Manhattan or Kings County Hospital Center in Brooklyn, where male
inmates from Rikers receive medical care, has no secure ward for
jail inmates receiving regular medical care, although there is a
secure psychiatric ward for inmates. Antenen said most female
inmates from Rikers receive their care at Elmhurst, but there are
not enough of them to warrant a separate ward. One or two guards
accompany each pregnant inmate to the hospital and remain posted
outside the door when the inmate enters the labor or delivery room,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   A nurse who works in the Elmhurst delivery room and who spoke on
condition of anonymity said Rikers inmates were always placed in
restraints in the recovery room, which is in the public part of the
hospital. She said she had simply assumed that the practice was
Department of Correction policy. ``They follow their procedure and
we follow ours,'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Legal Aid Society said jail records kept by correctional
officers from Nov. 1 to March 1 indicate that two pregnant women
were shackled at Elmhurst during labor in December, and at least 20
inmates were restrained after they gave birth.
</P>
<P>
   Antenen said the jail records did not necessarily mean that the
inmates were shackled during labor. ``They might have been
restrained because they went right into the delivery room,'' he
said, explaining that pregnant inmates are transported to the
hospital in shackles. But he added, ``They were not restrained
while giving birth.''
</P>
<P>
   The hospital's director of external affairs, Dario L.
Centorcelli, said about 100 Rikers inmates are admitted each year
for delivery and are usually escorted by one or two guards. He said
that as far as he knew, no inmates were shackled during labor and
delivery. But he added, ``Afterwards, they are treated as a normal
prisoner, and it's up to Corrections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors prefer the patients not to be in handcuffs, but these
are prisoners, and Corrections has their guidelines to protect
against escape, and we have to bend with them,'' Centorcelli said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Lewis said the use of restraints after birth was so
routine that it seemed as if medical and security concerns were not
being weighed properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has not been input from the doctor as to whether a woman
who had a Caesarean or an episiotomy should be shackled'' while in
recovery, she said. ``Some of the women were in on a misdemeanor,
and putting those factors together, we would question the
appropriateness of those women being shackled.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewis helped monitor jail records for several years after
the decree. She said she had found that no inmates were shackled
during labor or delivery and very few were restrained after
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been happening very consistently in the last several
months,'' she said.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: PAYING MORE TAXES WITHOUT COMPLAINTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the procrastinators among us prepare to send in our tax
returns this week, there are a few certainties: Well-off people
will be paying a lot, but the companies whose stock they own _ and
whose success may have made those people rich _ will pay much less
than they would have a generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   That trend is an international one, reflecting the fact that in
an increasingly global economy it is much easier for a company to
pick up and move. Both states and nations are more likely now than
ever before to reduce taxes as a lure to corporate employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even small variations in local tax rates may have important
effects on capital flows and, by implication, on the economy as a
whole,'' reported James Hines Jr., an economist now at the
University of Michigan, after studying the flow of investment
within this country.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, Ireland has achieved rapid growth by offering low
corporate taxes. That infuriated Oskar Lafontaine, the former
German finance minister who wanted to raise taxes on German
business. Before he lost his job in a power struggle, he was
pushing for ``tax harmonization'' within Europe as a way to force
Ireland to raise its taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, with Lafontaine gone, Germany is likely to cut
corporate tax rates while also reducing preferences that have
allowed favored companies and industries to pay relatively low
taxes while those in other industries are hit hard.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, at any given tax rate corporate income-tax payments
fluctuate with the economy, falling in recessions and rising when
business is good. American companies are expected to pay income
taxes equal to 2.1 percent of the gross domestic product this year,
up from 1.6 percent in the recession year of 1990.
</P>
<P>
   But the overall trend can be seen more clearly by comparing the
two longest economic expansions of U.S. history _ the one from 1961
through 1969 and the current one, which began in 1991. During the
1960s boom, corporate income-tax collections peaked at 4.2 percent
of GDP, twice the current level. But individual income-tax
collections never got as high as the current figure, about 9.9
percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
   Just how you view the downward trend of corporate taxes depends
on your politics. To many on the left, and some on the right, it
demonstrates ``corporate welfare'' that lets powerful companies
avoid paying their fair share. Most congressional Republicans
ignore the drop in corporate tax collections, however, while
railing against the rising overall level of taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans have been stunned to see how indifferent voters
are to calls for tax cuts this year. In part, that reflects
President Clinton's success in making those who call for lower
taxes appear to be endangering Medicare and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   But it also reflects the fact that changes in tax law have made
it more certain that high-income taxpayers will pay more while
moderate-income families are hit less. Thanks largely to the
$500-per-child tax credit, a family of four earning the national
median income now faces a lower effective tax rate than at any time
since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   In the current boom, the number of people with high incomes has
soared. In 1992, just under a million tax returns showed adjusted
gross income of more than $200,000. In 1996, the latest year for
which figures are available, that number was up more than 50
percent, to 1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The increase reflects surging capital gains and stock-option
profits for corporate executives, and taxes on that income help to
explain why tax receipts have been higher than expected in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   For the government, there is a risk in growing increasingly
reliant on stock market-generated profits. If those profits stop
coming, tax receipts could be surprisingly small. But for now, both
the rich and the government are raking in the cash.

<P>
   TIRANA, Albania One of the world's nastiest border zones became
even more dangerous Saturday when Serb forces and ethnic Albanian
guerrillas escalated fighting and created new perils for the Kosovo
Albanian refugees trying to flee to safe haven here in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been machine gun fire, rifles, sniper fire,
artillery, mortars, even heavy artillery at some stages,'' said
Andrea Angeli, spokeswoman here for the 55-nation Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The OSCE monitors, expelled from Yugoslavia before the latest
ethnic cleansing campaign against Kosovar Albanians, now are posted
at border positions. The monitor team confirmed the continuation of
hostilities that began Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not far from refugee crossings,'' Angeli said, placing
the skirmishes at about 12 miles north of a border post used by
ethnic Albanians escaping what the refugees describe as threats and
harassment from Serbian Yugoslav police and militia.
</P>
<P>
   The border area fighting carries the danger of broadening the
Balkan conflict, should Albania itself come under heavy attack.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian Information Minister Musa Ulqini said at least two and
as many as six mortar shells originating in Yugoslavia landed on
Albanian soil Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fighting today continued to be very harsh,'' Ulqini said at a
briefing Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   He said that on Saturday the Albanian government removed 10,000
refugees from the more than 100,000 refugees who have been located
in the region's biggest camp at the the northeastern Albanian
border town of Kukes. The effort to relocate the Kosovar exiles has
become more urgent since the build-up of troops on both sides of
the border began this week.
</P>
<P>
   The major fighting between Serb troops and guerrillas of the
Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) is about 30 miles from the primary
border crossing used by refugees heading to Kukes. But Angeli said
the exiles have been making their way into Albania at a number of
border locations.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Friday, the OSCE reported that four KLA fighters were
killed and two wounded. Angeli had no reports of casualties
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Western intelligence sources in the region said Saturday that
KLA elements, after remaining for weeks in mountain redoubts in
northern Albania, crossed back to their home country to renew
fighting against the Serb-dominated Yugoslav government after it
closed the border crossings.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas may have resumed combat in an effort to protect
Kosovar refugees blocked from crossing out of Kosovo into Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Until refugees were trapped inside Yugoslavia, the KLA had kept
a low profile. The main border crossings into both Albania and
Macedonia were closed Wednesday, although a few hundred were
permitted to leave Yugoslavia in the early morning hours Saturday.
Afterward, the border apparently was closed again.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA and the Serb-led Yugoslav government were principals to
the Yugoslav peace talks brokered by the United States in February.
The guerrilla leaders reluctantly agreed to accept a package that
would give the Kosovo province of Yugoslavia the status of
autonomy, but not independence.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA also would have laid down arms under the agreement, and
an international peace force would have been stationed in Kosovo to
protect the population both ethnic Albanians and ethnic Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   But the Serb-led government would not agree to the plan,
resulting in the ethnic cleansing campaign that apparently started
just before NATO bombing began on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA may retreat back across the border again to hideouts in
Albania if NATO steps up its military campaign against the Yugoslav
government, as has been promised once the weather clears and more
NATO air power arrives.

IN TRIBUTE, SOLDINI ATTEMPTS RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It would seem that victory in a single-handed yacht race around
the world would merit a nap in an Alpine meadow, or a walk in the
park at least. But for Giovanni Soldini, the Italian likely to win
the Around Alone sailing competition, another sea adventure is on
the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   When the global race is over, probably in early May, Soldini
will be off to New York City. He plans to bring FILA, the 60-foot
sailboat he built for the Around Alone, to the docks at Chelsea
Pier. And as soon as the weather turns blustery, he and a small
crew will set sail in an attempt to beat the nine-day
trans-Atlantic record from New York to England.
</P>
<P>
   The voyage brings with it a measure of unfinished business for
Soldini, who failed in a similar attempt two years ago. At that
time, a fierce storm undermined his effort less than 400 miles from
the finish. But more to the point, his closest friend, Andreas
Romanelli, was washed overboard and vanished.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time I try that record,'' Soldini said in a telephone
interview last week, ``I lost one of my best friends to the ocean
in an accident. So now, we want to try again. This racing is a very
big walk in your life. But I think the sea and sailing teach you
how to live _ not to be too nervous and to understand what's
important in life.''
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old Soldini was one of nine solo sailors setting off
Saturday from Punta del Este, Uruguay, the third and last stopover
in the 27,000-mile Around Alone competition. With 5,751 miles to go
to Charleston, S.C., the race starting point last September,
Soldini has a commanding lead in the round-the-world event. He is
12 days ahead of Marc Thiercelin of France, the next closest
competitor in the Class I division, for 60-foot sailboats. And he
is 10 days ahead of Jean-Pierre Mouligne of France, the top racer
in Class II, for 50-foot boats.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-won victories are within the grasp of both Soldini, in
Class I, and Mouligne, in Class II. ``It's almost too good to be
true to be this far ahead of the others,'' Mouligne said last week
of the seven-day lead his boat, Cray Valley, has in Class II.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not really relaxed about it. The only way I could lose
is with a catastrophic failure on the boat, so I am checking its
rig carefully. My first goal is to win the race overall, but I
would like to win the last leg, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Mouligne is being dogged by two Class II competitors, Brad Van
Liew of Los Angeles, the only American left in the race, and Mike
Garside of England. Both men are hungry to beat Mouligne in at
least one stretch of the competition, a prize that has eluded them
in the first three stages.
</P>
<P>
   The race has been a long ordeal for all the competitors. Sixteen
solo sailors began the competition, but calamity rode shotgun on
several of the hulls. Mike Golding, of England, as well prepared as
anyone, struck a sandbar outside New Zealand at the end of the
second leg and lost the use of his boat.
</P>
<P>
   On the way to Cape Horn at the tip of South America during leg
three, Josh Hall and Thiercelin, two leading skippers in the
60-foot class, lost their boats' rigs and with the spars, almost
any chance of winning. In another leg-three mishap infused with
drama and heroics, Isabelle Autissier was rescued after capsizing
2,000 miles from nowhere in the South Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Fallout from that episode eventually took on its own tale of
strife. Soldini, who temporarily dropped out of the race to save
Autissier, became an international hero. But Thiercelin, who had
been slow to respond, was criticized for his lack of dependability.
</P>
<P>
   Thiercelin had been having mast problems on his 60-foot boat,
somewhere, when Autissier's mayday was reported. But race officials
concluded that such personal problems did not warrant disregarding
a life-and-death situation involving a fellow competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Soldini said last week that the episode clarified solo sailors'
overall responsibilities to one another. ``When you are alone in
the Southern Ocean,'' he said, ``it is very easy to make a bad
decision. But it is important to recognize the need to make right
value judgments all the time. The next time this kind of thing
comes up, nobody will have to think twice about whether to go or
not to go.''

A GUY WHO HASN'T WON A MAJOR AMONG THE GIANTS WHO HAVE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Scott McCarron quit golf after graduating from
UCLA in 1988 and went into business with his father. At that time,
McCarron knew he was not good enough to play on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven years later, McCarron has a chance to win the Masters,
starting Sunday's third round at 7 under par, one stroke behind the
leader, Jose Maria Olazabal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, I'm surprised a little bit by where I am,''
McCarron said. ``But once I turned pro, I had very high goals for
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarron recommitted himself to golf in 1992, and he has not
regretted the decision. Despite the imposing names that were on the
leader board, like Greg Norman, Lee Janzen, Nick Price, Davis Love
III and Bernhard Langer, McCarron said he would not be intimidated
playing in Sunday's twosome with Olazabal.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one time, Nick Price was sitting there, the guy who never
won a major,'' McCarron said. ``At one time, Greg Norman was the
guy who never won a major. Just because you haven't won a major
doesn't mean you're not going to win one. It just depends on how
you handle yourself down the stretch, and handling yourself at the
Masters down the stretch is going to be very difficult. That, I'm
looking forward to.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends and Rivals: Price and Norman
</P>
<P>
   Nick Price and Greg Norman are good friends, but that
relationship will be put on hold this weekend as both try to win
the Masters, one of the major championships that has eluded them
both.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Norman wants to win the Masters more badly, Price said:
``I don't know, I'm not inside Greg's head, so I can't tell. I
can't speak for him. I know how much I want it.''
</P>
<P>
   Price said that if he and Norman were paired together Sunday, so
be it. ``We've been there before,'' Price said. ``He who plays best
wins.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tougher, the Better
</P>
<P>
   When today's best players are mentioned, Lee Janzen's name does
not always come up, but he was in position to win his third major,
starting Sunday at 5 under par, only three strokes off the lead.
With two U.S. Open championships, Janzen has won more majors than
Tiger Woods, David Duval, Phil Mickelson or Justin Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I think I'm underrated sometimes?'' asked Janzen, repeating
a question. ``Yeah, sometimes. Why? I don't know. Maybe because
I've never had the one breakthrough year, like David Duval, or
Tiger Woods, or some other guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Janzen, 34, has proven his ability to win on difficult golf
courses, and he believes that a tougher Augusta National Golf Club
this year has improved his chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard there was going to be a little rough, I was
excited,'' Janzen said. ``The difference this year is I haven't
tried to hit any heroic shots, which a lot of times got me in
trouble. I'm more relaxed. I'm not as gung-ho to hit the ball right
next to the hole every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Putter Fails O'Meara
</P>
<P>
   Mark O'Meara, the defending Masters champion, was almost out of
contention after two rounds at 2 over par, 10 strokes off the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have the speed of the greens all day,'' O'Meara said
after his 76 on Friday. ``The key is you have to putt well here,
and I didn't. I just didn't feel comfortable. I never really put a
good stroke on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Patience About the Process
</P>
<P>
   Phil Mickelson, who entered the third round at 1 under par,
thought he would have to work on his patience. ``I'm thinking about
the end result, instead of going through the process,'' Mickelson
said. ``I need to think about the process instead of the final
number. If I ultimately want to win, that's what I have to do. The
challenge is to relax and let the shot be created, instead of being
forced.''
</P>
<P>
   Long Climb Ahead
</P>
<P>
   Bob Estes was still within striking distance at 1 under par
after two rounds, but he admitted that it could be intimidating to
look at a leader board filled with major winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I have the resume that the rest of the guys
have,'' Estes said. ``I would feel a lot better if I were 8 or 10
ahead of them. Thirty-six is a lot of holes, and on this course,
you can go in either direction. But it is a lot easier to go in the
wrong direction.''

FINANCIAL SETBACKS BRING SENSE OF DISTRUST AT THE DAILY NEWS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Helen Kennedy, The Daily News' reporter in the
Balkans, is heading home. On-the-spot coverage of the war and
refugee crisis in Kosovo is more than her newspaper can afford
right now; its newsroom budget has just been trimmed by 5 percent.
She is returning to a newsroom where no raises will be given this
year and where reporters must get approval before taking a source
to lunch.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News, the in-your-face tabloid that in the early 1990s
survived union confrontation, revolving-door ownership and
bankruptcy, has been knocked back on its heels by a series of
financial reversals.
</P>
<P>
   Just when the newspaper was ready to print a snazzy new color
edition, balky pressroom equipment scuttled the attempt. The
newspaper's owners, Fred Drasner and Mortimer B. Zuckerman, have
had to pay more than $2 million for replacement parts and overtime
by its pressmen in the last few months.
</P>
<P>
   Just when The News had amicably reached terms with its eight
craft unions, a labor arbitrator a month ago gave a ninth union,
representing the drivers, a far more expensive settlement. Since
the craft unions are entitled to the same raises, the paper faces
unexpected costs of $18.5 million in 1999 alone, News executives
say, and millions more in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Just when the paper was unveiling its expanded Sunday edition,
in which it is investing about $2 million, the new Sunday staff
finds itself coexisting with colleagues who are on a severely
restricted financial diet.
</P>
<P>
   No, this is not a reprise of the paper's near-death experience
less than a decade ago. But the financial pinch is making the
paper's owners testy, its journalists angry and its union leaders
nervous. ``If you're asking, is the timing exquisite,'' Drasner
said dryly, ``the answer is no.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Drasner and Zuckerman said they will ask for help from all
the newspaper's constituencies _ from employees to advertisers to
suppliers. But such assurances do not resonate in a newsroom
already bruised by cutbacks, low raises and the departure in the
last 18 months of ``enough colleagues to make up a baseball team,''
as one reporter put it.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper's editor, Debby Krenek, said the problems are
manageable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, the key is to be very judicious about what you spend your
money on,'' she said. ``You can do that. It's not fun. But it's
just managing things a little tighter. And if you do that, you
don't have to make the major cuts none of us want to make.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be no layoffs, she said, and no cuts in the space
that the paper devotes to news.
</P>
<P>
   But no amount of explanations can dispel the suspicion and
resentment the latest cutbacks bring. For nine months, the monthly
budgetary bulletins from The Daily News have seemed an exercise in
division. Spend. Cut. Spend. Cut. Look, we are really investing in
the Sunday paper. Look, this labor arbitration award is going to
cost a lot _ we will have to make some real cuts.
</P>
<P>
   And while all newsrooms are riled about something at any given
time, ``riled'' is too mild to describe the feelings at The Daily
News, the country's sixth-largest newspaper, where anger and
financial unease have made the place seasick.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the nausea has been provoked by unforeseen reversals _
or, from a less forgiving perspective, failed gambits.
</P>
<P>
   The paper might have gotten more relief from the pressroom labor
and equipment bills if it had not lost a lawsuit against Goss
Graphic Systems, which supplied the $62 million press. It might
have faced lower labor costs if it could have reached accommodation
with the drivers' union two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it is appealing the March award to the Newspaper and Mail
Deliverers' Union of New York, which represents 418 drivers who
ferry 723,000 copies of the paper across the five boroughs and into
the suburbs every day.
</P>
<P>
   These unexpected bills come on top of significant investments
the owners have made in the paper over the years. A new Unisys
newsroom computer system is costing at least $4 million, and
hundreds of thousands of dollars are supporting two extra reporters
and seven extra pages a week devoted to Brooklyn and Queens. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper's most heralded investment _ an expanded Sunday
section, for which the newspaper hired a marquee editor, Edward
Kosner, and planned to spend close to $2 million _ was upstaged by
the most stinging reversal, the labor arbitration agreement. The
Sunday expansion added about six people to a newsroom staff of
about 370. Zuckerman said he has increased the newsroom budget by
50 percent since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   All the upheaval has left the newsroom bruised. And what makes
the chronic discontent far worse, some on the staff say, is their
belief that the pain is not being shared equally. For all the
demoralizing cuts in the rest of the newsroom, Kosner's Sunday
budget appears untouchable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best reporting we have on the story of the year is being
yanked,'' said one senior newsroom executive of the Balkan
coverage. This person, like all but two of the newsroom employees
interviewed extensively, spoke on condition of anonymity. The
cutbacks ``send an extremely unfortunate psychological message,''
the executive added. ``It suggests that we don't have the money to
gather the news in the traditional way. Internally, the
juxtaposition of this and the Sunday launch is sending people into
orbit.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some of those who resent the Sunday staff's special status
readily concede that the new section, with its expanded opinion
pages and pull-out feature sections, is clean, well-packaged
journalism that may pull in more readers. And an emphasis on the
Sunday paper would appear to make economic sense, since Zuckerman
says it brings in about one-third of the newspaper's advertising
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   But when reporters and editors learned that the Sunday staff had
held a congratulatory dinner for 24 people _ employees and some
others _ at the pricey restaurant Cite on Wednesday, they were
quick to calculate how many days of Kosovo coverage that money
would have bought.
</P>
<P>
   Kosner, who said he had paid for the dinner himself, said that
the Sunday staff was already ``very lean.'' He added, ``I haven't
been approached about cuts, and I'm not making them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In December 1995, after the demise of a rival, New York Newsday,
The News' Sunday circulation reached about 1 million. By last
September, it was 815,000. The clear culprit in the decline was the
Sunday edition of The New York Post, the tabloid owned by Rupert
Murdoch. Its original price was 25 cents _ much less than The Daily
News, which responded by cutting its Sunday price to $1 from $1.50.
</P>
<P>
   But the readers still drifted away. At a time when all three
city dailies _ The Post, The News and The New York Times _ were
losing circulation, The News suddenly started hemorrhaging Sunday
readers. More than 20 percent of the circulation disappeared in
three years.
</P>
<P>
   The decline coincided with the period of rapid-fire newsroom
turnover, as Martin Dunn, the editor, left in 1996, to be replaced
by Pete Hamill, whom Zuckerman ousted nine months later. Zuckerman
then selected Ms. Krenek as editor, but after a little more than a
year, he diluted her authority by naming Kosner to run the Sunday
paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never viewed the world of journalism as static,''
Zuckerman said in an interview. ``It's always ongoing. I never have
been satisfied and will never be satisfied with any work in
progress. We've worked to improve it year after year after year. I
haven't taken money out of these entities. I've put money into
them. The editorial product is more important than anything. More
of the money has been invested in the editorial side of my products
than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   In the month since the bad news on the labor front, no one in
management has publicly uttered the words ``bankruptcy'' or
``sale.'' ``Those are the least agreeable options,'' Drasner said
in a telephone interview last week. If The News had the corporate
equivalent of galloping pneumonia with its strike, sale, bankruptcy
and resurrection in 1990 and 1991, the current situation is ``a bad
cold,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the two owners of this privately held company have little
inclination to open their books. Zuckerman says that the paper's
advertising revenues have risen every year. Drasner says that ``The
Daily News was profitable from the time we acquired it until we
began experiencing significant production problems resulting from
breaking in the new plant'' in late 1997 and early 1998. ``These
problems negatively affected distribution and circulation,'' he
added, in a reference to the balky printing equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Drasner added, ``The recent arbitration decision will have a
substantial adverse affect on our profitability going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Without a public balance sheet, it is impossible to know how
badly the labor arbitration ruling could hurt the business. People
are treading cautiously.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the eight labor unions that make up the Alliance of
Printing Trades, whose battles with previous owners were visceral
and violent, say almost nothing about the current situation, on the
record or off. Those eight unions already have negotiated wage
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   But as they were negotiating, all were aware that the one
maverick union, the drivers union, had reached an impasse with
Zuckerman and Drasner, and that the parties had entered binding
arbitration in April 1997. The craft unions' agreements stipulated
that whatever the drivers got, the craft union members would get as
well. Those ``me too'' clauses added millions of dollars to the
total labor bill when the arbitrator's award was announced.
</P>
<P>
   A tenth union, the Newspaper Guild, has no part of any of those
agreements, and the journalists in it are less hesitant to
criticize management. ``I think that the owners of this paper have
given short shrift to the people who produce it day in and day
out,'' said Tom Robbins, a reporter who covers labor. ``I think
that Mort and Fred take a lot for granted in this newsroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Some reporters have asked one another if savings could not be
achieved by cutting back on contracts with suppliers, particularly
since some of them are companies in which Zuckerman and Drasner
hold an interest.
</P>
<P>
   One of these, Applied Graphics Technologies Inc., helps prepare
advertisements for publication for clients like General Motors,
Walt Disney Co., The New York Times _ and The Daily News. For
several years, Applied Graphics personnel have created ads for the
newspaper and helped digitize its photo library, services that cost
$6 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Such dealings between companies with common ownership are legal,
providing that all the services are provided at market rates.
``Whatever we do, we do on a market-based basis,'' Zuckerman said.
``One of the things you learn in business is you don't subsidize
one company with another.''
</P>
<P>
   If newsroom employees are concerned about such matters, Drasner
said, they would be better advised to worry about their own work.
</P>
<P>
   The effect on the paper's journalism is not immediately evident.
The newspaper that offered a ground-breaking series on the spread
of asthma among inner-city children a year ago is also breaking
ground on aspects of the Amadou Diallo shooting. The Washington
columnist, Lars-Erik Nelson, is probing to find the appeal of
potential presidential candidates like John McCain. And reporter
Helen Kennedy, through this weekend, was putting a face on the
Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But that kind of coverage is less affordable than it used to be.
And, as Ms. Krenek observed: ``When we covered the war in Bosnia we
didn't cover the war the entire time. And for the amount of time we
did cover it, we ran up a bill of $70,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not giving up on the commitment to cover'' the Kosovo
crisis, Ms. Krenek said, ``but we're trying to be judicious about
it. Helen went over on a relief flight. She's coming back on a
reasonably priced commercial flight. If the United States sends in
ground troops, we'll send somebody back.''

   OLY-CONGRESS _ After a brief reprieve, the IOC bribery scandal
is heating up again, this time in the halls of Congress. A
congressional committee begins considering legislation Wednesday
that could cripple the IOC by denying it millions of dollars in
sponsorships. The legislation would strip the IOC's tax-exempt
status in the U.S, limit the amount of Olympic fees sponsors could
deduct and place U.S. TV rights fees _ the single biggest source of
Olympic income _ with the USOC instead of the IOC. The White House
was asked almost a month ago by the U.S. Olympic Committee to
include the IOC under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and an
answer is possible Tuesday. And the Justice Department and the FBI
also are investigating possible violations of federal fraud and tax
laws. (Turner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 40.

 &HT;    Security breach penalty stuns Air Force
 &HT;    By Wes Hills
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ U.S. Air Force officials were embarrassed by how
easily a Chinese computer programmer penetrated a critical weapons
database. Now they are shocked by how little prison time he faces.
</P>
<P>
   The database, managed from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base,
advises commanders on the combat readiness of weapons systems, such
as F-16 fighters and B-2 bombers.
</P>
<P>
   Zhangyi ``Steven'' Liu's hacking of the $148 million Reliability
and Maintainability Information System set off alarms at the
highest levels of the Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
   Liu, 26, born in Shanghai and hired by a subcontractor, gained
access to passwords that gave him the power to create, change or
delete any file in the system.
</P>
<P>
   One top Air Force official described it as the most serious
security failure in decades, according to recently disclosed
documents.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force officials were shocked by two things:
</P>
<P>
   _ Liu did it easily, since the weapons maintenance computer
system had virtually no security checks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Liu could not be charged with a felony. He faces at most one
year in prison if convicted of gaining illegal access to an Air
Force computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is the most serious nonviolent crime committed
within the past 20 to 30 years, and there are no laws that cover
this type of crime,'' said Rick DeNezza, the Material Systems Group
executive director, according to U.S. District Court records in
Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Liu, who faces trial May 17, plan to argue that
the Air Force is responsible for the security breach. The Air
Force, they say, allowed nearly a dozen programmers from China to
service the system without ever telling them what they couldn't do.
</P>
<P>
   The trial may carry major risks for Liu as well.
</P>
<P>
   Liu's jury will be selected amid national focus on suspicions
that China stole nuclear weapons designs through espionage at the
Los Alamos National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Wen Ho Lee, a Taiwan-born American computer scientist at the New
Mexico lab, is the focus of that investigation. He was fired March
8 for violating security regulations, but has not been charged with
a crime.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department said Tuesday it had suspended all
scientific work on sensitive computer networks computers at Las
Alamos, Sandia and Lawrence-Livermore national nuclear weapons
laboratories over fears that security lapses made the computers
vulnerable to espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Liu's case appeared to be resolved in March 1997, when he
pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts of gaining illegal access
to REMIS.
</P>
<P>
   Col. William J. Colmer, who manages more than 170 information
systems for the Air Force, testified at a sentencing hearing that
Liu's penetration of REMIS led to a review of thousands of other
Air Force information systems across the world ``to search for
similar vulnerabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``the real fear'' of Liu's intrusion ``was not that Liu had
discovered something helpful to a foreign government,'' said one
federal official who asked not to be identified. ``The fear is that
he was in a position to put bugs in the program and cause the
program to go down at a critical time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens,'' this source asked, ``if you can't fly planes
because nobody can tell the status of the planes?''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Magistrate Judge Michael R. Merz sentenced Liu in May 1998
to 6 months in jail and fined him $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   But Merz recently permitted Liu to withdraw his plea, concluding
he had not fully cautioned Liu of all of its consequences.
</P>
<P>
   In his brief seeking a new trial, Liu's federal public defender,
Randolph W. Alden, noted that on the eve of Liu's plea, the Air
Force Office of Special Investigations issued its report of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   That report, Alden stated, ``showed that levels of access (on
REMIS) had not been established, therefore, it was impossible for
Liu to have exceeded his authorized access.''
</P>
<P>
   High grades, low pay
</P>
<P>
   Liu, born in Shanghai, the People's Republic of China, is the
only child of poor parents.
</P>
<P>
   But with the help of several scholarships, Liu obtained a
bachelor's degree in electronic engineering in 1994 from Shanghai
Jiao Tong University, where he was rated an ``excellent student''
in the top 10 percent of excellent students at the university,
according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   He landed his first job in 1995 at Shanghai Tandem Software
Systems, a subcontractor used by a Litton Industries Inc.
subsidiary, Litton PRC of McLean, Va., the prime contractor for the
REMIS system.
</P>
<P>
   Court records and other sources said Liu earned only a fraction
of what U.S. computer programmers would be paid _ $500 a month,
which he sent to his parents. He also received about $35 per diem.
The company also paid his rent (up to four at a single apartment),
utilities and medical insurance and provided an older car for
several employees to drive to work.
</P>
<P>
   Liu and 10 other Chinese foreign nationals were brought to
Dayton to debug and improve REMIS' developmental side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came with a dream to succeed in the land of opportunity,''
Liu told Merz.
</P>
<P>
   Then, twice in 1996, while seeking to review a performance
evaluation, Liu said he accidently discovered the ``super super''
passwords file for the system administrator. The file had the
passwords of more than 400 REMIS users.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with the passwords, Liu gained access to REMIS'
operational side, which performs the day-to-day logistical
functions of the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   Liu said he felt ``like a kid who found a toy... I found
Pandora's Box.''
</P>
<P>
   He has told court officials that people of his nationality
should not have been allowed to work on the system; security was so
lax, he concluded ``it was not a concern here.''
</P>
<P>
   No shields
</P>
<P>
   Liu drew support from Dale E.S. Blommendahl, who designed
Safeguard, a software security program provided to the Air Force to
secure REMIS and encrypt the passwords.
</P>
<P>
   Blommendahl, who now employs Liu at his XYPRO Technology Corp.
of Simi Valley, Calif., said REMIS security was so lax that
``anybody could have put in anything at any time. It just wasn't
protected.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the lack of audit logs would have led him to conduct an
audit of 2.5 million lines of computer code going back to the
beginning of the system. The first phase of REMIS became
operational in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Liu said he was ``allowed to walk in a room of secrets. They put
the tools in the room without ever telling me not to use them, and
just expecting that I wouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   When Liu's intrusion was discovered during routine maintenance,
it set off ``quite an uproar'' at the highest levels of the Defense
Department, said one source close to the probe.
</P>
<P>
   Court records show investigators feared the worst _ that Liu was
a cyberwarrior bent on espionage.
</P>
<P>
   These concerns weren't allayed after Liu and five of the other
Chinese programmers flunked lie-detector tests in which they were
asked if they had provided the passwords to anyone, downloaded the
password files to steal them for personal gain and used the
passwords files to gain access to other computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   Such tests, however, are not admissible in criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials declined comment on why they did
not prosecute other Chinese programmers who also admitted they
gained unauthorized access to REMIS, and allowed them to return to
China.
</P>
<P>
   And now that Liu has been allowed to withdraw his plea, their
testimony may no longer be available.
</P>
<P>
   `Scapegoat'
</P>
<P>
   Col. Colmer said it cost Litton and the Air Force $358,000 to
secure REMIS, including changing all passwords, installing
Safeguard and performing two painstaking reviews to determine what
Liu had done. He said those reviews determined that Liu had not
changed data or installed a ``Trojan Horse'' or back door through
which he could continue to enter the system.
</P>
<P>
   Blommendahl said the Air Force should foot the bill for securing
REMIS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if Liu had never set foot in Dayton, Ohio, all of the
code analysis and security upgrading would have needed to be done,
and would have been done at some point in time when the security
deficiencies in the REMIS system became apparent,'' Blommendahl
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steven is a scapegoat for their own stupidity and laziness,''
said Dayton attorney Gary W. Gottschlich, who previously
represented Liu.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just simply economic,'' Gottschlich said of foreign
nationals' access to such systems. ``There are many foreign
nationals from around the world working on such projects. They're
available and they're cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   After his arrest, Liu received a small severance. His only
assets were a Packard Bell computer valued at $1,500 and his
checking account, with a balance of $213.
</P>
<P>
   ``His employer, which has brought him to the U.S. from China,
abandoned him in Dayton with nothing more than a $700 severance
payment,'' said Dayton attorney Richard A. Maresca, who has also
represented Liu. ``He lost his car; he lost his apartment; he lost
his way home. His employer physically segregated him from his
co-workers, the only friends he had....
</P>
<P>
   ``He has lived for one year in confusion and terror over a law
enforcement and judicial system whose workings he cannot
comprehend.''
</P>
<P>
   What is REMIS
</P>
<P>
   _ REMIS contains, by tail number, the mission capability of all
Air Force aircraft. It also shows maintenance data such as parts
requirements and reveals what location each aircraft is assigned.
The data also include the communications, electronics and missiles
with which each aircraft is configured, according to court
documents.

WORKS OF ART FOR CLEMENS ON THE MOUND AND FANS IN STANDS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Roger Clemens will inspire the imagination of Yankee
Stadium's decorators like no other pitcher in club history. While
he made his debut as a Yankee here Saturday, a half-dozen amateur
artists tried to keep up with Clemens' strikeouts, in varying
fashions. Hanging from the grandstands, there were K's in script,
K's in medical tape and, in honor of Clemens' nickname, rockets
hung by one fan.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens struck out eight and allowed three hits in pitching
seven-and-two-thirds shutout innings in the Yankees' 5-0 victory
over Detroit. Clemens has not suffered a lost since May 29 of last
year; his 16 consecutive victories are one short of the American
League record, shared by Baltimore's Dave McNally (in 1968-69) and
Cleveland's Johnny Allen (1936-37). Carl Hubbell set the
major-league record of 24 for the New York Giants during the 1936
and 1937 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit hitters were 0-for-7 with runners in scoring
position against Clemens; the Yankees' starting pitchers' have held
opponents to just one hit in 18 at-bats with runners in scoring
position in 342/3 innings of work.
</P>
<P>
   Chili Davis and Scott Brosius each hit home runs for the second
consecutive afternoon, and the Yankees won their fourth consecutive
game with Don Zimmer, the interim manager, in charge. When Manager
Joe Torre, recovering from prostate cancer, visited with the
Yankees' general manager, Brian Cashman, before the game, Cashman
asked jokingly: ``What if Zimmer starts the season 20-1? We might
not want you back.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clemens stretched and warmed up, a handful of Tigers pitchers
watched from a distance. Clemens has his own routine, unique to him
_ for instance, Clemens will mimic the motion of fielding a
grounder and then firing to first base several times _ and if he
had not won a Cy Young Award or two along the way, his habits might
be seen as eccentric. But conventional wisdom is that Clemens does
everything for a reason, so others watch and learn.
</P>
<P>
   There was a lesson in how Clemens pitched to Tony Clark,
Detroit's towering first baseman. After throwing a curveball away
with his first pitch to Clark _ the big guy leaned over the plate
to get a closer look _ Clemens buzzed an inside fastball past
Clark, who flinched a bit. With Clark alerted to the real
possibility that he might step into a 94-mile-per-hour fastball,
Clemens subsequently pitched outside, and Clark waved weakly,
fouling off two fastballs and striking out on a splitter in the
dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's next at-bat occurred in the fourth; the Tigers' hitters
had compiled a single hit and four strikeouts by then. Clemens
continued to pitch outside to Clark, who seemed to be waiting for
Clemens to throw something inside. Clemens threw two curves for
called strikes, then uncorked a split-fingered fastball that Clark
flailed at unsuccessfully.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Guidry set the Yankees' single-season record for strikeouts,
with 248 in 1978, and in a sense, that mark is already in jeopardy:
Clemens has struck out more than that in each of the last three
years, and there aren't any signs of a let-up. He was completely
dominant against the Tigers. He allowed just a single hit in the
first four innings, and did not permit a walk until the seventh.
After going to a 3-ball, 1-strike count on Gregg Jefferies in the
first inning, Clemens did not reach his second three-ball count for
another 23 batters.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He did not throw more than 13 pitches in any of the game's first
six innings, finally reaching 19 pitches in the seventh. He threw
strikes to get ahead in the count, prompting the Detroit hitters to
chase other pitches out of the strike zone. Detroit's best chance
for runs came in the seventh, when Damion Easley led off with a
double, and with two outs, Bobby Higginson drew a walk _ probably
because Clemens chose to pitch around him.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Catalanotto pinch-hit for the shortstop Deivi Cruz, and
Clemens dispatched him with three pitches, the last a fastball over
the outside corner. Clemens pumped a fist, and the crowd of 42,058
cheered along with him. After Clemens was replaced in the eighth,
fans stood and roared, Clemens acknowledging with a tip of his cap
and a wave of his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Moehler, Detroit's starting pitcher, was arguably the most
effective pitcher against the Yankees last season, compiling a 3.10
earned run average with a 2-1 record _ not too many folks can say
they compiled a winning record against the Yankees in 1998 _ in his
unspectacular style, throwing strikes with an OK fastball, changing
locations. When asked about Moehler Saturday morning, Derek Jeter
said he could remember Moehler was a good pitcher with great
control, but he could not recall exactly what sort of pitches he
throws.
</P>
<P>
   But once the Yankees reacquainted themselves with the
right-hander, in their pregame examination of video and scouting
reports, they put together some runs. Davis hit his home run to the
opposite field in the second, Brosius smashed his in the fifth, and
Derek Jeter drove a two-run triple in the seventh before Moehler
was replaced.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH:
</P>
<P>
   Ramiro Mendoza, who pitched eight shutout innings Wednesday in a
start made in place of Hideki Irabu, will start again Tuesday,
according to Don Zimmer, the interim manager. Zimmer said he did
not know how long Mendoza will remain in the rotation, or how long
Irabu will remain in the bullpen, but he was sure Mendoza deserved
another start. ``This guy has done everything the Yankees have
asked him to do,'' said Zimmer, who will face a quandry if Mendoza
continues to pitch well: Zimmer believes the staff is better with
the versatile Mendoza in the bullpen. ... A day after being ejected
by the home plate umpire, Garu Cederstrom,the pitcher David Cone
visited with Cederstrom and apologized for yelling at him after
being relieved in the home opener, explaining that he simply
snapped after a long day of pitching in mushy conditions.

 &HT;    THE TAX MAN'S STING IS DEEPER, BUT COMPLAINTS ARE MUTED
 &HT;    With TAX-DATA-1STLEDE graphics material for each Cox state. For
release Sunday, April 11.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Americans, filling out the last lines of their 1040
forms for Thursday's tax deadline, are paying the highest rate of
federal revenues in the nation's peacetime history. Of every $5
generated by the economy last year, slightly more than $1 went to
Uncle Sam.
</P>
<P>
   Only one other time has revenue soaked up a greater share of
output, and that was at the height of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   So why aren't Americans chaining themselves to IRS offices and
staging tax revolts?
</P>
<P>
   At least part of the reason is rising personal income that has
taken some of the sting out of paying income taxes in the late
1990s. At the same time, the nation's tax burden has been shifting
sharply to the richest taxpayers. And perhaps equally important in
tempering outrage, few taxpayers have any concept of how much they
actually pay.
</P>
<P>
   Add to all of that President Clinton's vow to save the surplus
collections for Social Security, and even many Republicans in
Congress have lost their zeal for reducing taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly have been more receptive times for tax cuts,''
conceded Daniel Mitchell, a senior fellow at the Heritage
Foundation, who has been disappointed at lagging interest in
tossing out the tax code and replacing it with a simple flat tax
with one low rate.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional proposals for a 10 percent across-the-board cut
quickly died, replaced by a plan for unspecified reductions of $800
billion over 10 years. The president's budget, although it includes
a variety of targeted tax cuts, calls for more tax increases than
reductions.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a windfall of revenues continues to pour in, largely
because the rich have gotten richer and paid soaring amounts of
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Among those making $1 million or more a year, federal income tax
payments doubled between 1993 and 1997, according to a
Congressional Budget Office analysis. People with an adjusted gross
income of $200,000 or more paid 37 percent of all income taxes
collected by the federal government, although this group makes up
only 1.5 percent of taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our clients are paying through the nose,'' said Roger W. Lusby
III, an accountant with Frazier &AMP; Deeter in Atlanta. But he added
that annual tax complaints from clients in the upper brackets have
been somewhat muted by the booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock market's been good and the retirement accounts are
good,'' he said. He added that many are taking advantage of cuts in
the capital gains tax rate to a maximum 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the income scale, many low-income families
now receive checks from the federal government at tax time. With
the expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit since 1993, working
parents with low and modest incomes can receive up to $3,756 when
they file their tax returns this year.
</P>
<P>
   For middle class households, income taxes have remained fairly
stable. This year, many can lighten their load if they fit under
income ceilings that allow them to take advantage of child credits
($400 for dependent children under age 18), college tuition credits
(up to $1,500), and other recently enacted tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   More burdensome for these households is the payroll tax for
Social Security and Medicare, levied on a salary base that rose
this year to $72,600. The combined 15.3 percent charge (including
the half paid by the employer) is widely seen as regressive, since
it hits hardest families with less discretionary income. The
payroll tax now exceeds income taxes for the overwhelming majority
of American households.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, many taxpayers have only a vague idea of the total
amount they turn over to the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``A high school student working his first job, thinking he's
earning $10 an hour for seven hours and should get $70, is shocked
when he sees his first paycheck'' after the government takes its
share, said Kathy Burlison, a tax research specialist for H&AMP;R
Block. As for the rest of taxpayers, she said, ``We just accept it
as part of our society.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if a family adds up the tax money withheld from paychecks,
that would tell only part of the story. Various levels of
government collect dozens of less visible taxes, assessed every
time they pull up to the gas pump, buy a soda, take a trip or make
other purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Americans recognized the high level of taxation, there
might well be a second American Revolution,'' wrote Bryan Riley of
the National Taxpayers Union Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Americans for Tax Reform, a group that urges slashing revenues,
has estimated that ``hidden'' taxes add an average 35 cents to the
cost of a $1.14 loaf of bread, 18 cents to a can of soda, and
$63.60 to a $159 airline ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The Tax Foundation, a private research group, has totaled
revenues of all kinds and come up with an average cost of nearly
$10,000 for every American last year. That's more than the average
per-person cost of housing, food and clothing combined.
</P>
<P>
   So are taxes too high? That depends on your perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington's paycheck has been growing faster than America's
paycheck,'' said Scott Hodge, at Citizens for a Sound Economy
Foundation, who favors an across-the-board tax cut. ``Tax revenues
as a percent of gross domestic product is estimated to be over 20.7
percent in 1999, the highest since 1944-45. And there's no end in
sight.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodge estimates that since Clinton took office, 35 cents of
every new dollar of personal income created by the economy has gone
to taxes.
</P>
<P>
   However, at the liberal Citizens for Tax Justice, tax policy
director Michael Ettlinger applauded the increase in tax
collections.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people are doing well, they pay more taxes. That's a good
thing,'' he said. ``Now's the time to pave roads and build new
school buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he said, more loopholes should be closed so that the
rich pay even a bigger share. Dismissing charges that government
will waste money, he said, ``I think most of the money goes to
things that help people.''

BROTHER JOHN SELLERS, BLUES AND JAZZ SINGER, DIES AT 74  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Miss., Ill.)   By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Brother John Sellers, a singer known for his raw and
earthy rendition of blues, jazz and gospel music, died on March 27
at his home in Manhattan. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers, who suffered from diabetes and high blood pressure,
died in his sleep, said a spokeswoman for the Alvin Ailey American
Dance Theater, with which he was long associated.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers learned to perform by watching minstrel singers like
Robert Johnson and Blind Lemon Jefferson on the streets of
Clarksville, Miss., where he was born. By age 5, he was dancing,
singing and playing the tambourine in tent shows put on by the
Sanctified church, whose worshipers were known as Holy Rollers.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later he was discovered by the gospel singer Mahalia
Jackson, who took him away from the bordello where he lived after
being abandoned by his parents. He went to Chicago, where he lived
with Jackson and with relatives of his mother. He began to sing
with Jackson, who was becoming famous, and sometimes filled in for
her on concert dates. He also attached himself to the blues singer
Big Bill Broonzy, with whom he studied informally.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1950s, Sellers made two well-received recordings for
Vanguard Records' new jazz line, working with musicians like Sonny
Terry, Johnny Johns and Jo Jones. In 1958, he went to Europe with
Broonzy to perform and record, and enjoyed a huge success. Not long
after, he became a regular at Folk City, a new nightclub in
Greenwich Village where singers like Joan Baez, Bob Dylan and Paul
Simon and Art Garfunkel got early exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers was singing at Folk City one night in 1961 when a young
choreographer named Alvin Ailey wandered in, drawn by the sound of
his voice. The artists were soon collaborating on Ailey's ``Blues
Suite'' and ``Revelations,'' whose scores were arranged by Sellers
and incorporated his music.
</P>
<P>
   His singing reminded Ailey of his childhood in rural Texas. ``A
mans blues _a solo man _ (maybe Ailey, maybe not),'' the
choreographer wrote in a poem called ``John Sellers Sings.''
</P>
<P>
   Sellers' last performance with the Ailey company was in 1997. At
the time of his death he was in litigation with the dance company
over royalties and the copyright to ``Revelations.''
</P>
<P>
   Sellers also performed on Broadway in Langston Hughes'
``Tambourines to Glory.'' During his years with the Ailey company,
he continued to sing in Europe and in the Far East and performed in
the late 1950s and 60s in lectures with Studs Terkel, a longtime
friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brother John had a light tenor voice that was very strong,''
Terkel said, adding that ``the sinful and the secular'' could be
heard in his singing. ``He was no Mahalia, no Bill Broonzy, but
there was a clarity and a sense of urgency. When Brother John sang
`Wading in the Water,' for example, you got the feeling of the
young preacher inviting the people into the shallow waters, that
they had to do it because if they did, they'd be found, they'd be
saved. Brother John had this way of making things come alive.''
</P>
<P>
   No immediate family members survive.

IN SECOND HOMES, NO VACATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Vt., Conn., N.J., Mass., R.I.)  (lb) 
 By MARY McALEER VIZARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ken Davis has been looking for a second home in
Vermont for several months now, but hasn't yet found what he wants
at the right price. ``I've put bids on a few properties,'' he said,
``but they weren't my dream houses, so I could afford to let them
go.''
</P>
<P>
   But with the nice weather coming, he is getting a little
anxious. ``My intention is to have a place in 30 to 60 days,'' he
said. ``I want to take advantage of the low interest rates now and
have the house to enjoy in the summer and fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Real estate brokers say that the problem for Davis and other
buyers is a pronounced lack of inventory in certain desirable
categories in almost all markets from as far north as Vermont and
the Adirondacks to as far south as the Jersey Shore and Bucks
County, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of inventory in turn reflects several seasons of strong
markets in popular second-home areas. In the Town of Southampton on
Long Island, the dollar value of property sales last year was $1.4
billion, more than half again the figure for 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut's Litchfield County, sales were up 20 percent in
1998 over the previous year. And brokers report that, whether in
the Berkshires, the Jersey Shore or the second-home market in the
northern reaches of Westchester County, demand is especially strong
at the highest end of the market, with regular sales of second
homes carrying price tags of over a million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and his wife, Margie, are prepared to spend $200,000 to
$225,000 for a four-bedroom house, with cathedral ceilings, a
winding driveway and spectacular views. ``My ultimate dream,''
Davis said, ``is to sit out on the deck with a cigar and a glass of
Grand Marnier, maybe barbecue, and watch the world go by.''
</P>
<P>
   At one time the couple thought about postponing their
second-home purchase in favor of buying a larger permanent home or
upgrading the four-bedroom bilevel they now have in Franklin Lakes,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we decided that we really want to get out of the daily
grind and have a place to go to decompress,'' said Davis, who works
as a manufacturer's sales representative. ``Instead of having my
money sitting in a bank or mutual fund, it's better to enjoy it,
and buying a second home helps diversify your portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   Vivian Thomas, a sales agent with ReMax Star Properties in
Manchester, Vt., has been working with the Davises and is clearly
frustrated. ``We're out of inventory in their price range,'' she
said. ``What we have people don't want, like the dated chalets with
avocado appliances and the harvest-gold shag carpeting.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are plenty of those available, Ms. Thomas said. She
now has one under contract, a three-bedroom, two-bath chalet, with
a deck and hot tub, that sold for $101,000. They can even go as low
as $59,000 for a small two-bedroom, one-bath A-frame. ``That's not
what most people want today,'' Ms. Thomas said. ``They're really
for the bargain hunters.''
</P>
<P>
   The Davises represent, in many ways, the typical buyers now
coming through her door, Ms. Thomas said. ``They're primarily young
families in their mid-30s,'' she said. ``They're more
sophisticated, less bargain hunters. They have a very specific idea
of what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said that he was concentrating his search in and around
Manchester ``because I like that it's near skiing.'' (The closest
areas are Stratton and Bromley.) ``But there are also other
activities, like fishing, hiking and biking. I plan to use the
house year-round.''
</P>
<P>
   Manchester is, in many ways, a traditional New England
community, with an idyllic Colonial-era town center comprised of a
collection of white clapboard buildings. It is the kind of place
where, in the evening, soft amber lights glow from the windows of
historic inns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything slows down when you get up there,'' Davis said.
``You can really feel it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Manchester is also known for its outlet shopping centers,
which have been designed to fit in with the prevailing
architecture, and attract large crowds, especially on the weekends.
``I like the shopping and activity level,'' Davis said. ``I want a
country house, but I don't want to to be in the middle of
nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year the people who walked into Ms. Thomas' office were
looking primarily for properties priced from $100,000 to $150,000.
Now, she said, it's $200,000 to $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers in many second-home markets say they find people are
ready to buy, and that money is not their first concern. Rather
it's finding what they want. In some areas, with higher-priced
housing stock, the high end of the market has really taken off, say
brokers, even for properties over $1 million. But those, too, are
in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a reflection of interest rates,'' said Nora
Preusser, who owns a real estate agency in Garrison, where the
market for second homes has moved up sharply in the last three
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buyers are realizing that the time to buy is now,'' Ms.
Preusser said. ``Trouble is, we often can't accommodate them
because we don't have the listings. In the 20 years I've been in
the business, I've never seen inventory this low. It's one-half
what it was a year ago. We have twice as many buyers as properties
available.''

<P>
   In the lake communities in the Adirondacks, interest has spiked
in the last year and a half for ``large houses with waterfront
property,'' said Roger Friedman, a principal of Friedman Realty, in
Schroon Lake. ``But we don't have the product,'' Friedman said.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Inventory isn't low in all categories, only in the ones people
seem to want,'' Friedman said. ``People are interested in houses in
the low $200,000s to mid-$300,000s. The majority of our listings
are for cottages, selling for $170,000 to $190,000.''
</P>
<P>
   The lowest listing now is for a small three-bedroom shorefront
cabin for $119,000. ``There's very little over $200,000, that's the
problem,'' Friedman said.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman Realty's sales area encompasses five lakes, including
Schroon, Loon, Brant, Friend's and Paradox. His office recently
sold a four-bedroom contemporary with 250 feet of waterfront
property and 4.8 acres on Schroon Lake for $495,000, which is the
area's high end. ``It sold for the asking price,'' said Friedman,
``which is happening more and more.''
</P>
<P>
   The Adirondacks attract a particular kind of buyer, said
Friedman's brother, Joel, a partner in the business. ``What
distinguishes us is the abundance of lakes we have and natural
beauty,'' he said. The residential properties are part of a state
park, with six million acres of mostly untouched wilderness, with
little development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's in its natural state here,'' said Joel Friedman.
``You have to like the outdoors. Buyers up here are more
conservative, not as tied in to the stock market and interest
rates. They're buying a dream.''
</P>
<P>
   David Smith and his wife, Mary, decided to buy a house on
Paradox Lake after visiting last summer. ``It was the Fourth of
July weekend, and there were maybe three boats on the water,''
Smith said. ``We thought, `Wow, we're less than four hours from
Manhattan and look at this,'''
</P>
<P>
   The couple bought a three-bedroom, ranch with a knotty pine
great room and an 8- by 42-foot screened-in porch, ``which is
important during black-fly season,'' said Smith, who owns an
insurance company in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking to spend about $200,000 and realized that this
same house would be $450,000 on Lake George or Bolton's Landing,''
he said. ``Even if I could have afforded it I wouldn't have wanted
those areas because they are insanely busy in the summers and one
thing we definitely wanted was peace and quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   The commute to the Adirondacks can be off-putting to some, but
some actually find it restorative. ``When I turn off the Northway
and the trees come together over my car,'' said Emilio Locascio, a
Yonkers contractor who owns a house on Schroon Lake, ``I feel like
I'm entering the enchanted forest.''
</P>
<P>
   On most Fridays, the ride takes him about three hours and 40
minutes, he said. ``The 40 minutes you drive past Lake George is
the price you pay for privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the five-lake region, only Schroon Lake has a downtown, a
main street with one supermarket, a convenience store and a few
other shops. ``For so long Schroon Lake was considered primarily a
summer resort,'' Roger Friedman said. ``But now people are
discovering it for winter recreation as well.'' Just this year, the
only movie theater in town installed its first heating system.
</P>
<P>
   Such rustic surroundings don't appeal to everyone, which is why
some buyers prefer to stay closer to New York City, where the
market for second homes has been booming. From the mid-'90s, the
second-home market in Columbia County has improved between 30
percent and 50 percent in the areas that are considered the most
popular, said Esther Anderson, who owns a real estate agency in
Kinderhook.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are primarily interested in the southern section of the
county,'' she said. ``There's also interest in the eastern section
bordering Massachusetts. Most people don't want to go north of
Kinderhook.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Inventory is so low that people are now buying properties that
have languished on the market for years because they need work, or
they're on the main roads,'' she continued. ``Most people want
homes priced between $200,000 and $500,000. Bidding wars are common
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales in Litchfield County, Conn., were up 20 percent in 1998
over the previous year, according to Elyse Harney, who owns a real
estate agency in Salisbury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the best selling year in 10 years, since we came out of
the 1987 slump,'' Ms. Harney said. ``In 1997 things started to sell
and it hasn't slowed down.''
</P>
<P>
   Most houses go for $300,000 to $500,000, she said, although it's
possible to get something for less. One current listing is for a
converted schoolhouse in Norfolk, Conn., with three bedrooms, two
baths and cathedral ceilings on 3.4 acres. It is priced at
$195,000.
</P>
<P>
   Another area that has benefited from its proximity to New York
City is Westchester County, where the second-home market has picked
up in recent years, according to Ebie Wood, manager of the Pound
Ridge office of Houlihan/Lawrence. ``Some of our communities, such
as Pound Ridge and Bedford, even though they're only one hour from
Manhattan, are completely different environments,'' Ms. Wood said.
``It's an alternative from the Hamptons. We're getting people who
couldn't stand the commute.''
</P>
<P>
   People looking for a second home in Westchester want a unique
property with some acreage, Ms. Wood added, noting that the houses
tend to start at $650,000 and go into the millions. Second-home
buyers are ``not looking for a traditional colonial,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Garrison and Cold Spring, in Putnam County, ``60 percent or
more of my customers come from the city and use the houses here as
second homes,'' said Ms. Preusser, who owns a real estate agency in
Garrison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business is a third better than a year ago,'' she said. ``It's
hard to find anything below $350,000. We're also very low in the
$500,000 to $700,000 categories. Then it jumps to $1 million and
up.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Berkshires, brokers are getting a lot of requests for
houses that sell for more than $3 million, said Charlotte Isaacs,
who owns a real estate agency in Stockbridge, Mass. ``Years ago we
used to sell one or two in the $1 million-plus category,'' she
said. ``In the past year we've sold a dozen.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The high end has also been booming in the ocean communities.
``It's wild here,'' said Cheryl Vetovick, manager of Diane Turton
Realtors, in Spring Lake, N.J. ``Most listings are staying on for
only a week or two,'' said Ms. Vetovick, who sells mostly in Spring
Lake, Sea Girt and Belmar. ``Bidding wars are common. A house
listed at $600,000 recently sold for $100,000 over the asking
price. I haven't seen a market like this in the nine years I've
managed the office.''
</P>
<P>
   Her office recently sold a house in Sea Girt for $3.9 million.
``That's the highest house price we've ever had and it sold in 10
days,'' Ms. Vetovick said.
</P>
<P>
   Million-dollar properties in Cape Cod have also started to move,
according to Larry Peters, co-owner of Cape Shores Real Estate in
Wellfleet, Mass. ``Everyone, it seems, wants to be near the
ocean,'' he said, ``but there's not a whole lot left.'' Peters
sells properties in Truro and Wellfleet. ``We're seeing
million-dollar all-cash deals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, New Yorkers have increasingly been opting for
houses in coastal Rhode Island. ``It's like we've been
discovered,'' said Raymond Mott, owner of Properties Unlimited in
Charlestown. ``We have people coming in pounding their chests with
money,'' Mott said. ``They want something by the water, and we have
nothing for them. It's a lot less active a mile away from the
water. The price range of $300,000 to $500,000 seems to be the most
comfortable zone for most people.''
</P>
<P>
   The east end of Long Island seems almost impervious to the
normal fluctuations of the market elsewhere. In the Town of
Southampton, for instance, property sales totaled $822 million in
1997, and rose to $1.4 billion in 1998. ``The market has gone up 1
to 1.5 percent per month during that time,'' said Tim Cunningham,
president of Cunningham Real Estate in Southampton. ``All price
ranges are active. The buyers are in their early 30s to mid-50s, at
the peak of their careers.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, he said, buyers are more particular about being on
streets with little or no traffic and they tend to use the houses
all year long, not just in summer. ``They're making a high
investment,'' Cunningham. ``I guess they feel compelled to use it
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales so far this year have also been healthy on Fire Island,
said Rose Ann Larson, who has an agency in Saltaire and also sells
in Kismet. ``In the last 12 years, sales were a little bit late, at
the end of the season,'' Ms. Larson said. ``Sales have already
started this year. All price categories are moving, from a low of
$225,000 to over $1 million.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bucks County, Pa., doesn't have the ocean, it does have
the Delaware River and canals, and is a 75-minute commute from
midtown Manhattan. ``It's been a wonderful market,'' said Troy
Baker, director of sales for Kurfiss Real Estate in New Hope, Pa.
``At the end of March, we did $60 million of business, which is
exactly the same as the first half of last year.''
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ``weekender,'' Baker said, wants acreage and a
swimming pool. ``The high end here is $1 million. Anything at the
low end, or $200,000, hardly lasts a week,'' he said. ``For that
you'd get an attached duplex house or town house, not a
single-family home. Most people want a three-bedroom single-family
home with a couple of acres for $300,000.''
</P>
<P>
   People come to Bucks County for a rural feeling, the
recreational opportunities of the Delaware River and the canals,
Baker added. ``We get a lot of artists and writers,'' he said. ``We
have the Bucks County Playhouse. Sally Jessy Raphael just sold her
bed and breakfast, but still maintains a home here.'' Popular towns
include New Hope and Solebury.

 ALOU THINKS THE EXPOS WILL STAY IN MONTREAL
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ The Olympic Stadium sit-in lasted only one day.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the Montreal Expos had their biggest crowd,
43,918, in nearly three years for their festive 1999 home opener _
a 5-1 victory over the Mets _ things were back to normal Friday
night. The announced crowd was 12,386.
</P>
<P>
   The big-budget Mets pounded the low-budget Expos, 10-3, behind
Mike Piazza's five runs batted in. The banners bashing the Montreal
team president Claude Brochu were at a minimum. It was as if the
town had slipped into a collective hangover, knowing that the
antiquated track-and-field stadium might have hosted its final home
opener.
</P>
<P>
   But the message from the night before was clear: there are
baseball fans in this French-speaking city, and they want the Expos
to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to be here,'' Montreal manager Felipe Alou
said Friday afternoon. ``And the players believe we're going to be
here. Until I and the players see a significant move announced,
this club will be here. But I don't believe it has anything to do
with attendance. I don't believe it has to do with managing, or
wins, or how many fans show up anymore. There's been too much water
under the bridges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowd last night was significant. It sent a good message
that if you do things right, there will be people here. But I don't
believe the fans will save this franchise. They've never been given
a chance before, so why now? It's up to everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Like financing a new downtown stadium, an official arbiter for
many franchises' survival these days. If the city can find the
financing within the next six weeks, there is a good chance that
the Expos, who have been here 31 years, will stay. If not, they are
likely headed for northern Virginia or Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, wherever the Expos call home next season, there is
a good chance that they will be good.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time in the eight years that I've been
managing here that we didn't lose any significant players,'' said
Alou, who has had to endure yearly fire sales. ``And it looks like
we won't lose any next year. Now, the question is, are we going to
stay here or leave? Will there be a new stadium here or not? Will
there be more money invested here or not? Those are the players
now. It's a whole different game.''
</P>
<P>
   And the game is being played, as Alou was trying to get across,
not just on the field or in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, the fans made a statement with their presence.
``I have the feeling that the people who came and the people who
couldn't come and wished they could have been here, they want the
club to stay here,'' Alou said. ``Otherwise we would have had
15,000 people or 10,000 people for our opening day.''
</P>
<P>
   And what the fans saw was a team with the pieces falling into
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know this club is getting better,'' Alou said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In 23-year-old right fielder Vladimir Guerrero, the Expos have a
top young player.
</P>
<P>
   Mets catcher Mike Piazza said of Guerrero, ``The ball makes a
different sound coming off his bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero pounded a double and a home run in Friday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Complementing Guerrero in an improving lineup are left fielder
Rondell White; first baseman Brad Fullmer, who was seventh in the
National League in doubles last season with 44; and the rookie
catcher-third baseman Michael Barrett, the team's most highly
regarded prospect, who drilled a two-run homer Friday night on the
first pitch he had seen at Olympic Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing holding the Expos back from contending this year,
Alou said, was the development of their young pitching staff. After
the opening-day starter, Dustin Hermanson, there are questions.
``But there are no questions about their arms,'' Alou said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there any question that in Ugueth Urbina, the Expos
possess one of the most dominant closers in the game.
</P>
<P>
   These Expos seem poised for a return to the success they enjoyed
earlier in the 90s. In 1994, the Expos had the best record in
baseball before the players went on strike; and in 1996, they were
eliminated from post-season contention on the next-to-last day of
the season. The stars of those teams _ Larry Walker, John
Wetteland, Ken Hill, Pedro Martinez, Marquis Grissom and Moises
Alou _ were basically sold off in waves. No one knows the fate of
this year's team yet.
</P>
<P>
   Alou said his team and the fans deserve better, but he also
knows they can only do so much to preserve Montreal's baseball
heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if Guerrero wins the MVP,'' Alou said. ``That's
not keeping the team here. Pedro Martinez won the Cy Young. And if
we win the division or the wild card, that's not going to keep the
team here.
</P>
<P>
   ``But don't tell me you like baseball today and then you don't
like it next year. I don't believe it. It's just that hopes were so
high and then you don't see Wetteland, Hill and Walker. And there
were others I don't remember.'' &QL;

 SUSPECT IN SLAYING OF JERSEY POLICE OFFICER ARRESTED  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A man has been arrested in connection with Thursday's
fatal shooting of an Orange, N.J., police officer, although no
charges have been filed against him yet, officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Weiss, a spokesman for the Essex County Prosecutor's
officer, said the man ``is a serious suspect,'' whom investigators
were still questioning Saturday. The man was arrested Friday night
after scores of police officers spent 24 hours scouring the streets
of Orange, a 2.2-square-mile city of 29,000 residents northwest of
Newark, and nearby communities.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the prosecutor's office and the Orange Police
Department declined to identify the suspect or to discuss the
circumstances of the arrest. ``If and when he's been officially
charged, we'll go through that,'' Weiss said, adding, ``the
investigation is continuing.''
</P>
<P>
   The slain officer, Joyce Anne Carnegie, 38, was shot in the head
and abdomen at close range after approaching a man who matched the
description of a robbery suspect, the authorities said. The
victim's younger sister, Gayle Carnegie, said the police called
Saturday morning ``to say they have the guy in custody and they
would be getting back to us with the details of the arrest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just so overjoyed to know that they caught the guy so
quickly,'' said Ms. Carnegie, a nurse's aide who lives in Newark.
``We know that the police do their job, and we know that they love
one of their own fellow police officers. They were out there all
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the officers searching for Carnegie's killer worked
through the night, canvassing the streets, backyards and parking
lots of the normally quiet town in patrol cars with their sirens
blaring. The police director, Richard Conti, was said to have
stayed in his office from Friday until about 7 a.m. Saturday; his
assistant left at 1 a.m., only to return later in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, residents dropped bouquets at a makeshift memorial
near the site of the shooting, and friends and family lovingly
recalled a woman who took seriously the role of the beat cop as
guardian of a community.
</P>
<P>
   Carnegie was the first member of the Orange Police Department to
die in the line of duty in 33 years, and the second female New
Jersey officer ever killed on the job. Her death sent the
113-member police force into emotional turmoil, and members of the
City Council spent Saturday morning at police headquarters
consoling grief-stricken officers.
</P>
<P>
   Carnegie lived with her mother in North Plainfield. She
discovered a love for law enforcement while working as a security
guard at a Sears department store, according to her mother, and
continued to work part-time as a guard at a clothing store when
off-duty.
</P>
<P>
   A funeral has been scheduled for 11 a.m. Thursday at St.
Matthew's Church in Orange, Ms. Carnegie said.

MOREY BERNSTEIN, PROPONENT OF BRIDEY MURPHY, DIES AT 79  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ireland, Colo.)   By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Morey Bernstein, the Colorado businessman who pursued an amateur
interest in hypnotism all the way back to 19th-century Ireland as
he coaxed a young mother into recounting a previous life as a woman
named Bridey Murphy, died on April 2 at his apartment in Pueblo,
Colo. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   His family said the cause was an irregular heart beat.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when hypnotism is old hat, the occult is fashionable
and a Shirley MacLaine can blithely claim memory of a dozen
incarnations, it is hard to imagine the sensation created in 1956
when Bernstein published ``The Quest for Bridey Murphy,'' an
account of how he had repeatedly hypnotized a woman he called Ruth
Simmons, taking her farther and farther back into her childhood
until she went over the hump, as he put it, and emerged with a
thick Irish brogue describing a presumably previous life in eerie
and persuasive detail.
</P>
<P>
   Within months of the book's publication in January 1956, it
created a cultural brush fire, elevating hypnotism into something
of a national mania and laying the groundwork for a later surge in
interest in reincarnation and channeling.
</P>
<P>
   Publication started with an optimistic initial press run of
10,000 copies, but sales were so brisk that by the middle of March,
200,000 copies were in print, though ``Bridey'' was not even at the
halfway mark of its 26-week run on the best-seller list of The New
York Times. The book, reissued in 1965, was eventually published in
30 languages in 34 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the inevitable ``come as you were parties,'' and
cartoons in which parents greeted newborns with ``welcome back,''
the book, bought mainly by those who rarely read books, touched off
a 25-fold increase in the sale of works on hypnotism. Pretty soon a
vast crop of newly minted amateur hypnotists started performing at
parties all over the country, invariably getting eager subjects to
recall all sorts of previous lives in chilling detail, suggesting
to psychologists and other skeptics that highly impressionable
subjects were so eager to please their hypnotists that the merest
urging that they focus their minds on past lives led them to
ransack their unconscious minds for stray childhood memories and
reassemble them into a convincing former life.
</P>
<P>
   By the time ``The Search for Bridey Murphy'' came out as a movie
late in 1956, with Louis Hayward as Bernstein and Teresa Wright as
Ruth Simmons, such skepticism was ascendant, especially after
investigators in Ireland had failed to find any record of Bridey
Murphy or her family and a Chicago newspaper series had found many
parallels between incidents in the real Ruth Simmons' girlhood in
20th-century Chicago and those she attributed in her trances to a
previous life.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bridey believers concede that the various
investigations failed to prove that she had lived as she had been
described, they also insist that the investigations failed to prove
she had not.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bernstein never wavered in his belief that his
subject really had a previous life in Ireland, but then he came
from a family that had taken a lot on faith.
</P>
<P>
   There was, for example, his grandfather, Morris Bernstein, whose
belief in America as the promised land led him to flee the pogroms
of Russia and make his way to New York, where he stayed just long
enough to learn, as family legend has it, that junk was the
immigrant's calling, that every Jewish immigrant in New York was
already a junk dealer and that he should go west to seek his
fortune.
</P>
<P>
   When he heard later that the only steel mill west of the
Mississippi was in Pueblo, he went there and opened a junkyard with
scrap metal as a specialty in 1890. By the time his grandson
entered the business some 60 years later, after graduating with
honors from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in
1941, his father and uncle had renamed it Bernstein Brothers and
turned it into a thriving business dealing in heavy equipment,
plumbing supplies and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Morey Bernstein made it flourish even more, developing a large
mail order operation specializing in ranch equipment and supplies.
</P>
<P>
   For all Bernstein's business success, the incident that would
change his life came when he went to a party in the early 1940s and
saw a friend perform hypnotism as a parlor trick. Bernstein was so
impressed that he soon became an amateur hypnotist himself, reading
everything he could on the subject and hypnotizing his country club
friends to a fare-thee-well, sometimes just for the novelty of it,
sometimes in an effort to cure chronic headaches and other
ailments.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Bernstein hypnotized Ginni Tighe, as she was then
known, the 27-year-old wife of a local car dealer, he knew she was
the best subject he had ever worked with. After some experimenting
with age regression, the two agreed to see if she could remember
anything before her birth, and in a tape recorded session on Nov.
29, 1952, she obliged.
</P>
<P>
   Her recollections then and in a series of other sessions (ended
the next year after she became pregnant with her third child)
became the basis for the 1956 book, with Mrs. Tighe disguised as
Ruth Simmons.
</P>
<P>
   Known as Virginia Morrow after a later marriage, she was never
convinced that she had been Bridey Murphy but retained an open mind
until 1995, when she died in a Denver suburb, perhaps for the
second time.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein, who gave up hypnotism after discovering Bridey
Murphy, sold his business in 1970, prospered in the stock market
using the techniques developed by Benjamin Graham and became a
major Pueblo philanthropist, donating land for the city's
convention center and an arts center and giving millions to the
University of Southern Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a brother, Robert, of Bethesda, Md.

ARTHUR M. HETTICH, EXECUTIVE WHO GUIDED POPULAR MAGAZINES, DIES AT
73  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass. )   By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Arthur M. Hettich, a retired senior executive for The
New York Times Co.'s magazine group and a former president of
Family Circle magazine, disappeared on Monday while swimming off
Grand Turk Island in Turks and Caicos and is presumed drowned,
according to his family. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
   Hettich's quick climb through the magazine world began in 1967,
when he became editor in chief of Family Circle, then owned by
Cowles Communications, and soon made it a hit by emphasizing
practical, how-to articles for women from all walks of life. Within
a year, the magazine's circulation had doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Just as quickly, Hettich rose through the ranks of the magazine,
becoming editorial director in 1975, senior vice president in 1982
and, in 1985, president of Family Circle, which The New York Times
Co. bought in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Hettich became senior vice president of The New York
Times magazine group, which included Golf Digest and Tennis and a
number of women's magazines. (The company has since sold most of
its magazines, but continues to publish Golf Digest.) After his
retirement from The Times Co., he continued to work as a
consultant, editor and writer.
</P>
<P>
   Born and raised in Brooklyn, N.Y., Hettich served in the Navy
during World War II. He received a bachelor's degree in English in
1949 from Amherst College and earned a master's degree in English
in 1950 from Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, Hettich was a reporter for The Daily Mirror in New
York and an assistant promotion manager for Redbook magazine. In
1957, he started his own publishing company Magabooks.
</P>
<P>
   From 1960 to 1967, Hettich worked at Cowles, rising to vice
president and director of public relations, before moving to Family
Circle.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, the former Mary Elizabeth Fitz
Randolph; three children, Michael, of Miami, John, of Katonah,
N.Y., and Elizabeth, of Brooklyn; a brother, Robert E. Hettich of
Westford, Ma., and five grandchildren.

MILSTEIN'S FAILED BID FOR THE REDSKINS IS BAD NEWS FOR THE
ISLANDERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Islanders' seemingly perpetual ownership mess,
which has seen the team fall even further from respectability this
season, probably will not be straightened out before next season.
Howard Milstein's failed attempt to purchase the Washington
Redskins made sure of that.
</P>
<P>
   When Milstein, the Islanders' co-owner, withdrew his $800
million bid to buy the Redskins last Wednesday, knowing that he did
not have the votes to be approved by the National Football League's
owners, groans could be heard from every corner of Nassau Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Milstein will not be rushed to sell the Islanders, whose
record (22-46-10) is the second worst in the National Hockey
League. Now, Milstein can take his sweet time, wait for bidders to
make offers and accept the highest amount. That could take months,
lasting through the summer, through the free-agent signing period
and into next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That does concern me,'' Islander forward Bryan Smolinski,
whose contract is up at season's end, said. ``Personally, I would
like to make this my home. But I don't know what's going to happen
with the offer sheet. All of this could be resolved by July. But I
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   While most players said they have not spent much time worrying
about the ownership mess, veterans like Smolinski and others who
have contracts to work out this summer (Trevor Linden, the
Islanders' captain, is another) have followed the situation
closely. Smolinski said he would like to see the two Milstein
brothers and Steven Gluckstern keep the Islanders, although that
does not seem likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really hope they keep the team and really want to do
something with it,'' Smolinski said. ``I think this is better than
the Redskins' organization. We're at rock bottom, but we have a
chance to really make this respectable again.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Islanders cannot be respectable until there is stable
ownership. That clearly is not the case now. On Thursday, one
high-ranking Islanders' official asked a reporter, ``Who are the
owners?'' He did not know because a report earlier in the week
suggested that Howard Milstein sold his 45 percent stake in the
Islanders to his brother, Edward, more than a month ago. The
transfer was never announced.
</P>
<P>
   The Milsteins and Gluckstern, who also owns 45 percent of the
Islanders, have put the team back on the market. They will
entertain offers of $150 million or more, according to an
Islanders' official. They paid $195 million for the Islanders and
the team's lucrative cable contract in February 1998. But it is
unlikely that they will get back what they paid for the team
because of the problems getting a new arena in Nassau County and
the unfavorable lease with SMG, the company that manages Nassau
Coliseum. The Islanders' front office would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a lot of problems,'' said the Canadiens' Scott
Lachance, who was traded by the Islanders to Montreal last month
after eight seasons on Long Island. ``It goes from ownership to the
players. The instability is frustrating for everyone. Thankfully,
I'm not in a position where I have to worry about that stuff
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You want all the guys to be happy,'' Lachance added. ``But
that's not going to happen until you get some stability in the
front office. I didn't realize until I got traded to Montreal the
difference. When you go to the locker room, you're just happy to be
there.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SLAP SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   Islander goalie Felix Potvin, who has not played since Feb. 24
because of a torn right groin muscle and sat on the bench for last
Thursday's game against the Canadiens, wanted to start last night's
game against the Carolina Hurricanes. Potvin, who is 1-6-1 since
coming to the Islanders on Jan. 9 from Toronto in exchange for
defenseman Bryan Berard, said he wanted to play before the season
ended. Coach Bill Stewart, however, said he would not play Potvin
unless the goalie's groin muscle was 100 percent stable. &QL;

COMMENTARY: ZONING FOR VISITORS THAT FLY IN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By IVER PETERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST CAPE MAY, N.J. _ To tourists, the way to Cape May is
nothing more than the two southbound lanes of the Garden State
Parkway that eventually peter out in a local street and end at a
liquor store on West Ferry Road.
</P>
<P>
   But consider the bird's-eye view, says Patricia Sutton, the
education coordinator for the New Jersey Audubon Society's Cape May
bird observatory. To a thrush or warbler or flicker beating south
against the approach of winter, New Jersey's sharply tapered cape
is a migratory trap, a funnel of land that gathers and focuses
flocks of southbound birds into the southern tip of the state until
suddenly the land ends at the Delaware Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shock,'' Ms. Sutton said. ``Cape May Peninsula is the
first major land's end the birds encounter on their way south, and
suddenly there's 13 miles of Delaware Bay to cross. It may seem
like nothing, but it's a pretty major hop.''
</P>
<P>
   So, tired, hungry and thirsty, the birds see the land give way
to water, they hit the brakes, and start looking for a likely place
to feed and to rest before heading over open water. Many end up in
Barbara Freels' big back yard here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, the birds _ I can't begin to tell you how many we get,''
said Mrs. Freels, a lifelong resident of West Cape May. ``We had a
whiskered tern show up all the way from Africa last year, so that
should give you an idea of how important we are for birds down
here.''
</P>
<P>
   So Mrs. Freels showed up at West Cape May Town Hall with about
100 other voters last week to support borough ordinance 268-99, the
Landscaping and Vegetation Plan, which is intended to keep the
borough bird-friendly, even as all those other tourists funnel down
here and buy up open space for retirement homes.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new ordinance, which West Cape May expects to adopt
next month, the newcomers would have to give up their habit of
cutting down trees on their lots and putting in pebble lawns of
crushed rock or shells where dune grass, goldenrod and wild plum
bushes once sheltered and fed migrating birds.
</P>
<P>
   Cape May City and Cape May Point have already adopted the new
rules under a state order that they do so in exchange for fresh
water from a new desalinization plant. West Cape May is under the
same order. And the rules are clear: Cut down a tree to build a
house and you must plant one or two elsewhere; 35 percent to 45
percent of the land must have plant life, depending on the zoning,
and in all cases there must be efforts to retain as much natural
vegetation as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all put plants in our yards,'' Ms. Sutton told the West
Cape May Board of Commissioners last week. ``We put trees in, we
put shrubs in, so let's get used to putting in plants that have
fruit, cones, catkins or seeds. A red cedar will feed 35 different
kinds of birds, but if you go to a nursery they'll try to sell you
arborvitae. Well, zip birds feed on arborvitae.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of those in the audience seemed to be on the side of the
birds, but the sentiment was not universal. Although it is changing
as newcomers move in, West Cape May is still the conservative farm
neighbor of glitzy Cape May City to the east, and many longtime
landowners are counting on making a lot of money from development.
None of them are keen on having the state tell them how to
landscape their property.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 878 acres total in town, and 300 acres are wetlands,
so that's a third for the birds already,'' Tom Douglas, a local
landowner, complained.
</P>
<P>
   James Roney, a town commissioner, said: ``I do feel that this is
a case of the state holding a gun against our heads, and that this
is something being imposed on us by the bureaucrats sitting up in
Trenton in their ivory towers. But I have nothing against birds.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Jackson, a professional fishing guide, cheered Roney up
when he said that birds increase property values.
</P>
<P>
   ``Birds do?'' Roney exclaimed with a mischievous grin. ``Birds
increase property values? Well, when we have our assessment, we'll
have to bring that into it.''

CLASSMATES, PARENTS AND POLICE SCOUR MANHATTAN FOR MISSING
SCHOOLGIRL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ More than 70 volunteers fanned out through Manhattan
Saturday with cars, cell phones and posters in a community effort
to find a 14-year-old girl who disappeared Thursday night after a
dentist's appointment.
</P>
<P>
   The girl, Maureen Lynch, is a ninth grader at the Convent of the
Sacred Heart, a school for girls at 91st Street and Fifth Avenue,
and the searchers included classmates and their parents, as well as
officers from the 13th Precinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine anything worse,'' said Monica Merrill, one of
the parents, fighting back tears. ``It's a universal fear.''
</P>
<P>
   The girl, who has a medical problem that causes fainting spells,
may have been sighted by a West Side doorman early Saturday,
Detective Pat McGovern said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the police distributed fliers in Central Park and in
every police car and precinct in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Maureen went on a class trip to the Black Rock
Forest, a nature preserve in Cornwall, in Orange County, and may
have been light-headed from sun exposure, her father, Robert Lynch,
said. That afternoon at the office of her orthodontist, Dr. Vincent
LaBruna, she appeared pale and light-headed and was urged to drink
fluids, the dentist told her parents later. At 7 p.m. when she had
not come home, her parents called the police and reported her
missing.
</P>
<P>
   She is 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighs 140 pounds, with red hair
and brown eyes. She was wearing either blue jeans or black Adidas
running pants and probably had on a blue fleece pullover jacket,
her mother, Mary, said. Her medical problem, known as
hydrocephalus, causes a chronic buildup of fluid in the brain, Mrs.
Lynch said, but it does not affect day-to-day activities.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, a doorman at Columbus Avenue and 62d Street called 911
to report that at approximately 1 a.m., he saw a girl resembling
Maureen. Suspecting that she was in trouble, he encouraged her to
call her family. When she declined, he gave her $5 and a subway
token, McGovern said.
</P>
<P>
   While that report raised hopes, it also deepened the mystery.
Standing with volunteers who assembled for supplies and
instructions at the Monsignor Farricker Parish Hall of the Church
of the Epiphany, Lynch said, ``I just want my daughter back
safely.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch, an actuary for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., and
his wife, have another daughter, 8.
</P>
<P>
   The disappearance ruptured the sense of security among
classmates at Sacred Heart and their parents. ``It makes it more of
a shock because it's such a beautiful school,'' said Ciro Scotti,
who volunteered to help search and whose daughter is one of 57
girls in the ninth grade. The children feel safe there, and by
extension, he said, parents feel that their daughters are safe in
the city. Former students include Caroline Kennedy.  &QL;

across Yugoslavia, as well as scores of tanks, artillery pieces and
trucks. Still, the Pentagon insists the air war is going well.

   KOSOVO-GITMO _ MIAMI _ Aritonne Georges, a Haitian in Lake
Worth, Fla., grew up in the hemisphere's poorest country and spent
three days in a flimsy boat trying to flee a brutal dictatorship.
Yet some of the worst days of his life were spent at Guantanamo
Bay, Cuba, which he calls a ``hell on earth.'' Those people
familiar with the U.S. naval base, like Georges, are appalled at
the idea of Kosovo refugees being housed there. So it's no wonder
the Clinton administration so far can't find any refugees willing
to come to Cuba. As a result, the Clinton administration appears to
be re-thinking its plan to airlift up to 20,000 refugees to Cuba.
Instead, they may house refugees on the U.S. mainland, or put more
money into providing shelter for refugees in Albania and Macedonia.
And that pleases people like Joyce Feilke, a school counselor in
Austin, Texas who lived at Gitmo for two years. She said ``we could
house the refugees better at a campsite in Austin than we could at
Guantanamo Bay. That place is enough to drive anyone crazy.''

   OLY-CONGRESS _ After a brief reprieve, the IOC bribery scandal
is heating up again, this time in the halls of Congress. A
congressional committee begins considering legislation Wednesday
that could cripple the IOC by denying it millions of dollars in
sponsorships. The legislation would strip the IOC's tax-exempt
status in the U.S., limit the amount of Olympic fees sponsors could
deduct and place U.S. TV rights fees _ the single biggest source of
Olympic income _ with the USOC instead of the IOC. The White House
was asked almost a month ago by the U.S. Olympic Committee to
include the IOC under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and an
answer is possible Tuesday. And the Justice Department and the FBI
also are investigating possible violations of federal fraud and tax
laws. (Turner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 40.

teachers could be the driving force behind poor educational
performance. University of Texas data from the 1996-97 school year
shows that students with properly certified teachers pass the TAAS
at higher rates than their peers with uncertified teachers. The
study also shows that the most affluent schools are more likely to
have properly certified teachers. Uncertified teachers are most
abundant in bilingual education, English as a Second Language and
computer sciences _ three key educational areas in a state that's
increasingly Hispanic and increasingly computerized. (Brooks,

HOW A DECISION LOOSENED CLINTON'S BURDEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the days leading to NATO air raids over
Yugoslavia, President Clinton was having trouble sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton does not tend to sleep much anyway, aides said, and they
attributed his recent restlessness, and the bags under his eyes, to
allergies.
</P>
<P>
   But once the bombing campaign began, Clinton was full of energy.
He would stride from the Oval Office to the situation room, or pop
in on one White House office or another.
</P>
<P>
   His days were full of meetings with foreign policy advisers,
telephone calls to world leaders, briefings from strategists, and
the requisite public statements to build support for the military
action _ while juggling domestic issues.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's involvement in the finer details of the military
operation was such that sometimes he personally checked off targets
NATO should hit because, one Democratic operative close to the
White House said, ``He knows that both God and the devil are in the
details.''
</P>
<P>
   With the bombing campaign now well into its third week, and as
the uncommon has become patterned, Clinton's aides say the demands
of commanding the war have eased.
</P>
<P>
   The political demands, however, may be on the rise. Congress
returns from its spring recess this week, and aides are voicing
determination not to allow Kosovo to become a new excuse, after the
impeachment, for Congress not to act on the president's agenda on
taxes, health care, and preserving Social Security. Fresh lines
were drawn Saturday, as Clinton focused his weekly radio address on
welfare reform, but Republicans responded in their message with
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides say that with US involvement in Yugoslavia
unlikely to end soon, the president is trying to strike a balance
in paying proper attention to the biggest foreign policy crisis of
his presidency, while also tending to other government issues and
to politics, especially helping Vice President Al Gore to succeed
him as president.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for the first time since NATO launched strikes on
March 24, Clinton ventured outside Washington to promote a domestic
initiative. At a rally Friday in Philadelphia, he pushed for a
patients' bill of rights when dealing with health maintenance
organizations. In the speech, Clinton admitted that the event was
unlikely to make the evening news because of Kosovo, despite the
presence of dozens of members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The organized forces of the status quo will do nothing,''
Clinton said about changing the HMO system. ``They will say, `Oh,
well, the president went to Philadelphia, and he brought all the
Congress members here, and there were 100 members of Congress
around the country, but they probably can't break through on the
evening news tonight because of Kosovo. That's another excuse we'll
have to let this thing slide,' '' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Clinton plans to resume his fund-raising for
Democratic candidates. After canceling a fund-raising swing through
Cincinnati, Las Vegas and Sacramento on the week the bombing began,
he now plans to attend Democratic fund-raisers Friday in Detroit
and Boston. He also will make a fund-raising appearance in Austin
on April 21, in a visit to dedicate a new airport.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Lewis, a senior adviser to Clinton, said that it would have
been inappropriate to attend fund-raisers as the NATO bombing
campaign began. But now, ``it is important to make clear that we
are in for the long haul,'' in Yugoslavia, she said. ``Therefore,
the work of government is going to go on at every level.''
</P>
<P>
   Another senior aide said that Clinton continues to worry about
the Kosovo outcome, and that he is not treating it as ``just
another event'' in days that, on two occasions including Saturday,
have included time for golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has some concerns to make sure this comes out well,'' the
aide said of Kosovo. ``This is certainly a serious matter _ it's
the thing that we probably start each day thinking about and end
each day thinking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides say that Clinton has read newspaper coverage of the
conflict, some of it more closely than others. They say he is
acutely aware of the criticism of his methods and objectives in the
Balkans, especially given the personal nature of some comments
about his status as the first baby boomer president who also had
protested the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   One Democratic source familiar with his thinking said Clinton
believed he could not stand by while ethnic Albanians in Kosovo
were being killed and driven from their homes. He said Clinton has
buffered himself against the criticism by believing it was his job
to take a larger view beyond the pundits.
</P>
<P>
   This source said Clinton thought some of the early criticism,
especially from Republican presidential candidates, was
``politically motivated and was the kind of criticism that did not
attach itself to his predecessors in similar contexts.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas B. Sosnik, a Clinton aide, described his boss's attitude
thus: ``We had a series of tough options, none of them particularly
attractive. We're proceeding on it; it seems to be working. It's
going to take some time, and we haven't looked back.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton talks to Gore every day about Kosovo. Gore calls the
president for updates, even while on the road campaigning for the
nomination. Aides for both men say that political considerations
are not a factor in the administration's decision against sending
ground troops, at least at this stage of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a straight-up, do-the-right-thing'' kind of
conversation, a Clinton aide said. ``If you get tangled up in
trying to figure out all the politics, you are going to lose sight
of what you are trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic operative said: ``The political considerations
are indirect. I don't think Al Gore or anyone on his behalf is
arguing that we don't want to deal with this next year, so let's
not send in ground troops.''
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom, the strategist said, the White House political
strategy is being driven by then-General Colin L. Powell's doctrine
of using force: ``Let's do what we can do that we feel confident we
can generate long-term public support for.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategist said that while polls show growing support for
the use of ground troops, the backing could easily and quickly
evaporate when you ``start shipping home body bags.''

 &HT;    Faulkner earns both high grades, hard knocks as UT president
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The elite group of high school students invited
to visit the University of Texas shuffled to their seats and waited
for UT President Larry Faulkner to deliver the inevitable hard
sell.
</P>
<P>
   It never came.
</P>
<P>
   ``This setting probably isn't the right setting for every one of
you,'' Faulkner flatly told them, arms folded across his chest, as
they snacked on cookies and Cokes. ``It's very important for you to
find a place where you are well-matched.''
</P>
<P>
   This scene on a recent Friday was classic Faulkner: direct,
low-key, no frills.
</P>
<P>
   In his first year heading the nation's largest university,
Faulkner's style and approach are under the microscope. He's
getting grades ranging from ``A plus'' to ``incomplete.'' Not all
of his chores have been as pleasant as courting students like
Dalton Newsom, an East Texas high school senior who said Faulkner
won him over.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office April 13, 1998, Faulkner has faced ongoing
protests from staff over their pay, an overnight takeover of the
Main Building by angry students and the skepticism of
high-technology executives he wants badly to woo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't take all this personally,'' he said. ``People who are
involved in all of those things are raising issues that are
important to them, and they're important to me. My responsibility
is try to find practical ways to address them. That often is a lot
tougher than people recognize.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner, who got a doctorate in chemistry from UT in 1969, just
three years after earning his bachelor's degree, approaches
problems with cool, scientific reserve. He gathers information,
analyzes it and then stakes out a position. It was that studied
approach that caused him to realize the value of acquiring the
exquisite $35 million Suida-Manning art collection for UT, a
triumph he considers his biggest achievement. He avoids making
dramatic statements on impulse, and the few times he has, he's been
stung.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call it rough,'' he said in a measured voice of his
first year as a university president. ``I would say it's been very
full.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got such a tough act to follow,'' English Professor Alan
Friedman said, referring to Faulkner's friend and predecessor, the
charismatic and eloquent Robert Berdahl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's doing well under difficult circumstances,'' said
Gretchen Ritter, an associate professor of government. ``I wouldn't
say he has had a honeymoon, in light of the extremely high regard
people held President Berdahl. People expected good things, and
there's a deep sense of loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are waiting to see how things are going to turn out
under President Faulkner.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner ultimately will be judged on how well he protects the
quality of a school that is not as financially robust as he
imagined.
</P>
<P>
   He is in the thick of a seven-year campaign to raise $1 billion
from private donors by 2004. He also is trying to persuade
lawmakers to provide a larger chunk than one-fourth of UT's budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``This university is not nearly as muscular as I thought it
was,'' Faulkner said in an interview at his office, its south
windows framing the Capitol dome. ``This university is working on a
per student basis with one half . . . to two-thirds of what most of
the other major competitors are working with. What that translates
to is better student-faculty ratios at other places, better staff
support for students at other places and better ability to attract
and hold graduate students.''
</P>
<P>
   On the same Friday he spoke to Newsom and the other students,
Faulkner met with lawmakers on the budget, spoke to several campus
committees _ including one he told several times to get its act
together _ accepted a $75,000 check to UT from Phillips Petroleum
executives, attended a reception at the Music School and spoke at a
banquet of math and science teachers.
</P>
<P>
   During that 13-hour day, Faulkner laughed frequently but did not
avoid delivering sobering news. He told a campus advisory committee
UT needs an additional $66 million over the next two years to pay
faculty, staff and graduate students salaries that are more
competitive with the best public universities, including the
University of California at Berkeley and the University of
Michigan. He's been told to expect a maximum of about $26 million.
</P>
<P>
   Several leading legislators said that if Faulkner doesn't get
all he wants, it's no reflection on his abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a very skilled advocate,'' said state Sen. Bill Ratliff,
the Mount Pleasant Republican who chairs the powerful Senate
Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Ratliff, an engineer known for his methodical demeanor, added
that he likes Faulkner's low-key style. ``Frankly, I appreciate
someone who tells me their case and trusts me to treat him
fairly.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner _ whom observers called a quick study with a deep grasp
of UT's complicated budget _ told the Faculty Council last month
that he is committed to raising pay, even if it means cutting
programs, hiring fewer people and shrinking enrollments. ``Why does
he have to pirate the staff to do it?'' asked Sue Gamel, an
academic adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner said his options are limited. ``I don't have the
ability to print money.''
</P>
<P>
   He has created seven study groups to work on priorities he
carved out last fall, including higher salaries. Other groups are
examining ways to make UT more accessible to students, financially
stronger, more closely tied to the high-tech community, more
involved in public schools, No. 1 in Latin American studies and
better-suited to undergraduates.
</P>
<P>
   Reuben McDaniel, a professor of management science and
information systems, said Faulkner's frank talk is refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed somebody who could look at people square in the eye
and say we are not going to be a first-class university without
more resources,'' McDaniel said. ``It's been wonderful to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the financial worries, Faulkner has had to grapple
with the fallout from the federal court's 1996 Hopwood ruling,
which led to a dismantling of affirmative action programs. The
issue is not going away as Texas shifts from a state dominated by
Anglos to one in which Hispanics and blacks together will outnumber
non-Hispanic whites.
</P>
<P>
   Students involved in the Anti-Racist Organizing Committee who
occupied the Tower overnight in October have continued to object to
Faulkner's stance on affirmative action. After agreeing to hold a
series of forums with the students, Faulkner said that while he is
committed to diversity, he intends to follow the law and seek new
tools to diversify the student body.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say he doesn't care,'' said Felicia Enuha, a
junior majoring in biochemistry. ``It seems to me he's doing what
he's being told to by the higher-ups, and that's where his
priorities are.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmund T. Gordon, an associate professor of anthropology who
moderated the first forum, praised Faulkner for taking part but
said students and faculty expect more.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to continue that process and go further in finding
innovative ways to increase diversity and foment a respect for
differences on the campus,'' Gordon said. ``Even after a year it's
not quite clear where he stands on the issues important to me. . .
. He needs to have more contact with the rest of us commoners and
students.''
</P>
<P>
   Denise Gobert, co-chairperson of the Graduate Student Assembly,
said she has easy access to Faulkner and sees him soliciting a
range of views.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be I was the one minority sitting around the
table,'' said Gobert, who is black. ``Now, there are two or three
others sitting around the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner, whose career included many chemistry awards and
teaching jobs at Harvard, Illinois and even briefly at UT, during
the 1983-84 school year, wants the university to be closer to the
community and state it serves. A campuswide open house March 6 drew
at least 20,000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's a start, he said. He also wants better ties with the
high-technology industry.
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner appeared on a panel in January before high-tech
executives but left them riled when he said UT ``will be here after
a large number of enterprises in this room are not.''
</P>
<P>
   Summit organizers had instructed panelists to be provocative,
but some said Faulkner went overboard, prompting audience members
to boo and toss whiffle balls his way. Lt. Gov. Rick Perry demanded
an explanation. Faulkner, who said the incident was retold with
more ``built-in rancor than actually existed,'' sent Perry and some
of the executives a five-page letter, not counting attachments, on
UT's work with high-tech businesses and its plans to expand work
force education and industry interactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Dr. Faulkner has gotten a bad rap,'' said Bill Bock,
CEO and president of Dazel, an enterprise software company. ``I
frankly believe we finally have somebody who really does care about
this and will make change happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are skeptical, including the high-tech entrepreneur who
was on the panel with Faulkner.
</P>
<P>
   ``For whatever reason, Dr. Faulkner has fallen into the status
quo'' of isolating UT from the community, said Andrew Heller,
founder of INT Labs, a networking startup in Lakeway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been here a year and started with more positive
discussions than he's ended it with,'' Heller said. ``I wouldn't
give him a failing grade, but I wouldn't give him more than a C.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Faulkner has won many admirers his first year, including
the secretaries he inherited at UT. His executive assistant, Nancy
McCowen, worked with him nine years in Illinois and came to UT,
even though it means living away from her family for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never met a man who is a better teacher, is more humble,
has more integrity and allows someone to do their job the way he
does,'' McCowen said.
</P>
<P>
   When Faulkner headed to the kitchen to rinse his coffee cup, he
wouldn't let her take it from him because the handle was wet.
</P>
<P>
   Although he often mentions his wife and their two adult
children, he does not display any family photographs or personal
mementos. There is nothing in his office or on his desk that says
Larry Faulkner works here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why that's true,'' he said. ``I have never taken
time to do anything of that kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Time has been at a premium this year. He was off-campus nearly
half the time, meeting donors, alumni and elected officials. Now,
with many important contacts made and $344 million raised toward
the $1 billion campaign, he plans to spend more time learning the
campus and the community.
</P>
<P>
   He appears to have the full support of UT regents and Chancellor
William Cunningham, who had a strained relationship with Berdahl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a president at a major public university has the most
difficult job in this country because he has so many different
constituencies that he has to satisfy or pacify,'' said Austin
lawyer Larry Temple, chairman of the Ex-Students' Association.
``I've watched with admiration and appreciation the way Larry has
acquitted himself in that role. . . .I give him an A plus.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner said the hardest part is finding time for himself and
his family. During football season, he worked six nights a week, as
alumni, donors and others came to town during the week for
meetings, receptions and other activities. ``I was ready to
collapse by Christmas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, he and his wife, Mary Ann, almost never eat dinner at
home more than once or twice a week. He hasn't had time to exercise
in months. Fortunately, he said, ``I've never been terribly prone
to stress.''
</P>
<P>
   He worked late on the Friday he spoke to the students so he
could meet people at the Music School reception and welcome the
science and math teachers at their banquet.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some of the three or four dozen people at the reception
might have been surprised to learn later Faulkner had been there.
He stood in roughly the same spot and chatted amiably with some of
the guests for nearly an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Regent Patrick Oxford, a Houston attorney, said Faulkner's
personality ``is a little bit of a surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you first start talking to him, he comes across in the
first instance as a little bit of a chemist _ reserved in
judgment,'' he said. ``But if you just poke around a little bit,
there's huge passion in there, and that's what's surprising. He's
not the kind of person who walks in a room and everyone looks at.
But if he does say something, he's the one everyone is looking
at.''

 &HT;    Up close and personal with Larry Faulkner
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Some things you might not know about Larry
Faulkner:
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to a chemist to have a favorite molecule:
``Anthracene,'' Faulkner said. Made up of carbon and hydrogen,
``it's beautifully symmetric, and I published my first paper here
at UT on the study of light generated from actions involving
anthracene.''
</P>
<P>
   He drives a 1996 Olds Cutlass, and its color is described in the
owners manual as orange-red. ``Just don't call it maroon,''
Faulkner said, referring to the Aggie color.
</P>
<P>
   As a high school student in Shreveport, La., he used to sail in
competitions with his father, James Clifford Faulkner Jr. He still
loves sailing but doesn't own a boat.
</P>
<P>
   He's ``probably not'' related to writer William Faulkner, he
said, but his dad used to visit Mississippi often, and some people
used to ask him if he was William Faulkner. ``We called him Uncle
Bill,'' Faulkner said.
</P>
<P>
   A seventh-grade teacher inspired his interest in science. He got
a telescope for Christmas in the eighth grade and became fascinated
with astronomy. He still has the telescope but said, ``I haven't
gotten it out of the box in quite a while.''
</P>
<P>
   As a freshman at Southern Methodist University, Faulkner tried
to follow his father and grandfather into civil engineering. But he
had a terrible time using a Leroy, a stylus device civil engineers
use to make block letters. It's designed for right-handed people,
he said. He switched to chemistry, a passion since high school.
</P>
<P>
   He's reading Michael Dell's book, ``Direct From Dell: Strategies
That Revolutionized an Industry.'' Next up is UT Professor Jim
Magnuson's ``Windfall.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner married his high school sweetheart, Mary Ann, who got a
teaching degree from SMU. Their daughter, Susan, 21, is at the
University of Illinois combining both her parents' interests: a
teaching degree with certification in chemistry and physics. Their
son, Brian, 27, has a chemistry degree and works for Dow Chemical
in Freeport.

 &HT;    Shot for over-40 club
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRISTOL, Tenn. _ NASCAR biannually brings its Winston Cup circus
to this small town tucked away in the Smoky Mountains, on the
border of Tennessee and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   While the spring and fall dates at Bristol Motor Speedway afford
locals an opportunity to herd in their livestock and milk racing
fans for camping and parking, it also gives some of NASCAR's
veteran drivers a legitimate shot at finding victory lane.
</P>
<P>
   Of the top 25 qualifiers in today's Food City 500 at Bristol, 15
drivers are over the age of 40. Pole-sitter Rusty Wallace and
veterans Bobby Hamilton, Robert Pressley and Darrell Waltrip, all
starting inside the first six rows, will make their best starts of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   On this half-mile oval, the second-shortest track still used on
the Winston Cup circuit, experience and mental concentration often
are more valuable than horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very tough, very demanding race,'' said 58-year-old
driver Dave Marcis, who will make his best start at 22nd. ``Just
the bouncing around and the jarring around here, and the speed and
concentration level you have to maintain, will wear you out.''
</P>
<P>
   There are still some familiar names in the front rows as
Wallace, Jeff Gordon, Bobby Labonte and rookie Tony Stewart took
the top four starting spots.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the drivers near the top of the points standings _
Jeff and Ward Burton, Terry Labonte, Mike Skinner and Jeremy
Mayfield _ will start near the back and pit on the back
straightaway, leaving them at a disadvantage on green-flag
pitstops.
</P>
<P>
   After spending the first six weekends of the Winston Cup
schedule on superspeedways, drivers like Marcis are looking forward
to an upcoming stretch of three short-track races in the next five
events.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will disagree, but I think short-track racing needs to
remain a part of NASCAR,'' Marcis said. ``It's important. You can't
take everything away. You can't take the apples out of an apple
pie. It ain't going to be good anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   There are only three tracks less than a mile in length _ Bristol
and Martinsville and Richmond _ that have six dates on Winston
Cup's 34-race schedule. Nashville and North Wilkesboro, N.C., two
other short tracks, lost their Cup races to superspeedways, which
allow track owners to build more seats around larger facilities.
``If everybody built one-and-a-half mile speedways, and that seems
to be kind of the trend these days, there wouldn't be anything to
this series,'' said Paul Andrews, crew chief for Mayfield. ``All
you would be doing is going from this market to that market to do
the same thing, week in and week out. That's not racing. That's
tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield, one of five Cup drivers who started their career on
the short tracks around Owensboro, Ky., agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where just about all of us came from,'' he said.
``Working your entire life to get to the top of motorsports and
then not having any short-track races would be like going home to
your mom's house and saying, `Why don't you bake that chicken
instead of frying it?' You still get the chicken, but it's just not
the same. I can't imagine NASCAR without short tracks.

 &HT;    Monte Carlo debut pushed back again
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bristol, Tenn. _ Chevrolet will delay the debut of its 2000
Monte Carlo race car until next season, officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet officials said NASCAR hasn't approved the model. The
car was to debut at the Coca-Cola 600 in Charlotte next month then
was pushed back to the Brickyard 400 Aug. 7 in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We at Chevrolet are disappointed that NASCAR has not yet
approved the Monte Carlo for use in Winston Cup competition,'' said
Kurt Ritter, Chevy's marketing general manager. ``This lengthy
approval process has been a major distraction to everyone. It has
now reached the point where time has run out for us and our
Chevrolet teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritter said Chevrolet introduced the model to NASCAR more than a
year ago. NASCAR officials tested six cars _ two Chevys, Fords and
Pontiacs _ at the wind tunnel at Lockheed Martin in Marietta after
the Cracker Barrell 500 at Atlanta Motor Speedway on March 14.
NASCAR officials compared that data to the new Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Further changes were requested by NASCAR and, as before, we
compiled with their requests,'' Ritter said. ``As it stands today,
NASCAR is asking us to make changes that, when compared to the
current '99 Monte Carlo and to other brands, would make the new car
uncompetitive on the race track.''
</P>
<P>
   Tough break for Earnhardt
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt, who is 16th in points and mired in a 38-race
winless drought, caught another bad break Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In the happy-hour practice following the Busch race, Earnhardt
lost control of his No. 3 Chevrolet and hit the wall in turn 1.
Earnhardt's car had extensive damage in the front and was removed
by a tow truck. He went to a backup car, so he'll start 43rd
instead of 34th.
</P>
<P>
   Close call for Buckshot
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup rookie Buckshot Jones of Tucker qualified for
today's race in dramatic fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, the ninth of 10 drivers to run in second-round qualifying
Saturday, knocked Ernie Irvan off the bubble for the 36th starting
spot. Jones had an average speed of 122.984 mph on his first lap,
and then his No. 00 Pontiac spun out in turn 4 on the second.
</P>
<P>
   But rookie Stanton Barrett, the final driver attempting to
qualify, couldn't beat Jones' time and missed the race. Joining
Barrett with DNQs were Rich Bickle, Derrike Cope and Carl Long.
</P>
<P>
   Changes for Junior
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt Jr., who will run five Winston Cup races this
year before jumping to the circuit full-time in 2000, has dropped
the Oct. 17 Winston 500 in Talladega, Ala., this season. Instead,
Junior will drive in the Exide Batteries 400 at Richmond, Va., on
Sept. 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd hoped to build a new superspeedway car for Talladega that
we could also use next year,'' said Dale Earnhardt, owner of his
son's No. 8 Chevrolet team. ``Unfortunately, the new Monte Carlo is
not going to be racing by Talladega, so we've had to make a change
in our 1999 plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Junior won the Busch event at Richmond in September and finished
second at the track in June.
</P>
<P>
   Pit stops
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Rudd seems close to hiring Joe Garone as crew chief.
Garone left Bill Elliott's team after the Primestar 500 at Texas on
March 28. ``We'd love to have Joe, but we gotta make sure it's
gonna work for everybody,'' Rudd said. ``But he'd be a big asset to
the race team.

 &HT;    Live from Daytona, it's Black College Reunion
 &HT;    By Ernie Suggs
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Spring break is alive and well in Daytona
Beach. At least that is the case for the 100,000 African-Americans
who have converged there this weekend for Black College Reunion,
the annual street party that attracts people from all over the
country.
</P>
<P>
   But as the crowds stretched Saturday across the miles of white
sand and cruised down Atlantic Avenue, the popular consensus was
that Atlanta's Freaknik, set to being late this week, may be on its
last legs.
</P>
<P>
   Many said they thought Freaknik, long the king of black college
spring break events, was already dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rumor has it that it has been canceled and moved to Los
Angeles,'' said Barnesta Porter, who came down from Birmingham,
Ala. ``They told us that the mayor didn't want it there anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is mind-boggling,'' said Afalabi Mega, an Atlanta vendor in
Daytona Beach hawking Black College Reunion and Freaknik T-shirts.
``People think it is not going to happen. I am down here serving as
an ambassador. We are letting people know about Freaknik.''
</P>
<P>
   While BCR's attendance has continued to grow, Freaknik observers
are expecting a crowd smaller than last year's 50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The miles of beach vs. Peachtree Street's asphalt is only one
reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Atlanta, they block all the exits off. The police will get
you for playing music too loud, for cruising, for everything,''
said Wallace Copeland, a native of Atlanta. ``Here, even though
they are being hard on us, at least they let us represent.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, in Atlanta, the unpredictable nature of Freaknik makes it
difficult to judge where people will be from one night to the next.
</P>
<P>
   In Daytona, everybody is either on the beach or on Atlantic
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Although the weekend started in controversy with the city's
attempt to block off traffic along the beach, the first two days of
BCR have been low in incidents and high on fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``In comparison to the two, Daytona Beach is a much better
event,'' said Melinda Tenn of Norcross, Ga., a Freaknik veteran.
``Here we have wide open spaces for these kids to run free.
Freaknik is necessary, but they need to find a way to control the
crowd and to make them feel more welcome.''

A KOREAN CHURCH LOOKS TO ENGLISH LANGUAGE MINISTRY TO STOP THE
`SILENT EXODUS'  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By VIVIAN S. TOY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The hundreds of people who fill the main sanctuary of
the Korean American Presbyterian Church of Queens in Flushing every
Sunday sit stiffly as the senior pastor, the Rev. Young Choon
Chang, preaches the ways of God to them in Korean. They murmur
solemn hymns, following the lead of string musicians and a robed
minister who waves his arms in broad strokes to keep time.
</P>
<P>
   Across the hall in a small chapel, a twenty-something crowd of
about 150 sways to the melodic strains of gospel tunes pulsating
from an electric guitar and drums. They are just as rapt as their
elders when the preaching begins. But here, it is in English, and
they erupt in laughter whenever John Choi, a 26-year-old
seminarian, makes a point in a worldly way _ like when he stopped
to tell them about the great time he had at a concert by the Trash
Can Sinatras.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the two congregations make up one of the biggest
Korean churches in the metropolitan region, with 3,500 members. The
Korean and English ministries also illustrate the two halves of a
familiar immigrant story. There are the first-generation
immigrants, who cling to the church and to one another in their new
country; and then there are their children, who grew up here and
struggle with just how much of their parents' culture to hang on
to.
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders hope that the English ministry will help solve
one of their community's biggest problems: the potential loss of an
entire generation _ a phenomenon that experts on Korean immigrants
refer to as a ``silent exodus.''
</P>
<P>
   While Korean churches mirror the Roman Catholic parishes of
Italian and Irish immigrants and Jewish congregations at the turn
of the century, one major difference is that the earlier immigrants
brought their religion with them, while many Koreans adopt
Christianity only after arriving here. Only 25 percent of the
population in Korea professes Christianity, compared with more than
70 percent of Korean-Americans, say clergy members and academics.
</P>
<P>
   That is in part because Korean Christians are more likely to
immigrate, since they tend to live in cities and are more
westernized. Many Korean immigrants, too, convert to Christianity
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   S.Y. Park, who immigrated from Seoul, South Korea, five years
ago, said her family joined the church ``because it's the only
place where our children can learn the customs of Korea.'' She and
her husband enjoy the chance to share a bowl of steaming noodles
with fellow immigrants in the church basement every Sunday, but
they are even more comforted by the knowledge that their teen-age
son is studying Korean in one of the school's 40 classrooms
upstairs.
</P>
<P>
   The church has long sent children toddler- to high-school age to
separate, fairly informal Sunday services at which both English and
Korean are spoken. But before the English ministry, the only option
adulthood provided was joining the more austere, strictly Korean
congregation. College students and young professionals often felt
they had little in common with that congregation, a generation of
immigrants who worked long hours running grocery stores and
dry-cleaning shops.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the church had provided simultaneous English
translation at Korean services with headphones, but it was still
losing more than 50 percent of its young members when they reached
college age, church leaders said. So five years ago they created
the Queens Presbyterian English Ministry, nicknamed Q-PEM, to stem
the tide.
</P>
<P>
   While Q-PEM is influenced by the Korean church, members say it
is much more casual _ in a phrase, much less Korean. Instead of a
receiving line of ladies who bow as you enter the church, a greeter
at Q-PEM looks you in the eye, smiles and points you toward a seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our interactions are definitely a lot more Westernized,'' said
Charles Paek, a Florida native who moved to New York about four
years ago. ``It's very Korean to have a sense of hierarchy, but at
Q-PEM, we call each other by our first names and we're all more or
less equal.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Chi, who at 29 is one of the oldest members of Q-PEM,
said he felt more at ease at Q-PEM, but staying connected to the
church of his childhood was also important to him. ``Even though I
don't really understand Korean that well, I'm still not totally
Americanized,'' said Chi, who immigrated with his family when he
was 5.
</P>
<P>
   Although the second generation may feel more at home in their
own ministry, the English ministry has by no means completely
bridged the gap between generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Korean congregation looks at the English ministry as the
children's church and treats it that way too,'' said Richard
Colligan, one of the few non-Korean members of Q-PEM. Colligan's
wife, Christine, is Korean-born and very active in the Korean
congregation.
</P>
<P>
   The English ministry is financially dependent on the Korean
congregation and is governed by the Korean ministry's board. A year
ago, for example, Q-PEM proposed that some of its members be named
deacons, but leaders of the Korean congregation turned them down,
saying the candidates were too young and inexperienced.
</P>
<P>
   Paek said that the relationship between the congregations is a
complicated and evolving one. ``It's not that the Korean
congregation gives us a lack of respect, it's more that in Korean
culture, we're supposed to respect and defer to them,'' he said.
``The tension is there because I don't think we completely
understand each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Pyong Gap Min, a Korean-born sociology professor at Queens
College, said that while most first generation Korean-Americans
attend a Korean church every Sunday, only about 30 percent of
second generation Koreans do. ``There's a big drop because the
first generation goes to church for networking and for
fellowship,'' he said. ``But the second generation is more
assimilated and doesn't need that as much.''
</P>
<P>
   Min said that many Korean-Americans also have criticized their
church leaders for focusing their energies only on church programs
and not playing a more significant role in the larger immigrant
community. The Korean clergy generally defers to business leaders
on political issues.
</P>
<P>
   Korean-American churches, primarily Protestant congregations,
have existed in New York since the early 1920s. Korean immigration
to the region has increased steadily ever since immigration quotas
were lifted in 1965, and there are now about 400,000 Korean
immigrants here, according to the Korean Association of New York.
Korean church leaders estimate that there now are more than 600
Korean churches in the area, up from about 150 in 1980. The highest
concentration is in Queens, which has more than 200 churches.
</P>
<P>
   The churches have thrived because immigrants have relied on them
for services. Larger churches provide citizenship classes, help
finding apartments and jobs, and Korean schools and seminaries.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders at the Korean American Presbyterian Church of Queens
are aware of the church's role in dealing with the tensions between
the generations, said the Rev. Brian Inbum Song, who oversees the
church's English ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like all immigrant groups, we hope our traditions and our
Christian life style will continue with our children and their
children,'' Song said. ``Fifty years from now, if we have failed,
it will be because we didn't plan well now.''

EDITORIAL: MEDICATING THE MENTALLY ILL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, April 11:
</P>
<P>
   Since last January, when Kendra Webdale was pushed in front of a
Manhattan subway train by a man with a history of mental problems,
politicians in Albany have been debating whether to make it easier
to force people with mental illness to take their medication.
Andrew Goldstein, the man accused of shoving Ms. Webdale to her
death, had been repeatedly hospitalized for schizophrenia, but
seemed to have a pattern of dropping out of his treatment programs
and neglecting to take his medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Attorney General Eliot Spitzer has proposed legislation
that would make it possible for courts to order some of the
mentally ill to follow their outpatient treatment programs or face
institutionalization. Proposing a new law in the wake of a widely
publicized tragedy is such a knee-jerk reaction for politicians
that Spitzer's bill deserves special scrutiny. But the idea has
real merit.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would apply only to people who have been hospitalized
due to a failure to follow a treatment program. When such patients
are released, hospitals or caregivers could apply to the court for
a special order requiring that they take their medication and
follow their outpatient program.
</P>
<P>
   Petitioners would have to demonstrate that the patients' history
showed a particular danger that they would fail to take care of
themselves, and that their conditions were serious enough to
justify court supervision. If patients ignored an order and failed
to take medication, caregivers could ask that they be recommitted
to the hospital for re-evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Civil libertarians worry that such a law could be used to force
medication or commitment on someone with borderline mental
problems. Spitzer and the Legislature must be sensitive to those
concerns. But they must also listen to families of the mentally ill
who too often see their loved ones' refusal to take medication lead
to recurrent psychotic symptoms. The result of that sort of
tailspin is seldom the kind of violence that led to the Webdale
tragedy. But it almost always takes a terrible toll on the patient,
the family and the community.
</P>
<P>
   That was just the pattern described last week by the parents of
a man shot while brandishing a sword on a commuter train. He had
been repeatedly treated for mental problems but failed to follow
through on his outpatient care. If the Legislature can make it
easier to avoid these crises, it should act promptly.

PETER THACHER, DIPLOMAT WHO HELPED LEAD A U.N. AGENCY, DIES AT 72  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., France, Kenya, Sweden )   By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peter Shaw Thacher, a former State Department official and a
retired deputy executive director of the U.N. Environment Program,
died on April 3 at a nursing home in Mystic, Conn. He was 72 and
lived in Stonington Borough.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was a brain tumor, said his wife, Mary C.
McGrath Thacher.
</P>
<P>
   As a leader of the U.N. Environment Program in the mid-1970s,
Thacher helped the agency assess environmental problems around the
world. Earlier in the decade, as director of the program's European
operations in Geneva, he built up the embryonic agency and forged
relationships with European governments and other U.N. agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very early environmental advocate,'' said Adnan Amin,
director of the U.N. Environment Program's regional office for
North America.
</P>
<P>
   Thacher was born in New York on Sept. 8, 1926. He served in the
Navy in World War II and was graduated from Yale College in 1948.
After graduation, he went to Paris on a summer trip and stayed as a
clerk-typist assigned to the Marshall Plan.
</P>
<P>
   He later served in the Korean War with the Department of the
Army. In July 1954, Thacher was aboard a commercial aircraft that
was shot down by Communists in China; 8 of the 18 passengers
survived.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, Thacher became a Foreign Service officer and
was assigned to the U. S. Mission to the United Nations, where he
stayed for 14 years. In 1971, Thacher became program director in
Stockholm for the U. N. Conference on the Human Environment.
Subsequently, he became director of the U. N. Environment Program's
European office in Geneva. In 1977, he went to Kenya as the
organization's deputy executive director, with the rank of
assistant secretary-general of the United Nations. He worked in
Nairobi until 1983, when he retired and returned to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   That year, he became a distinguished fellow at the World
Resources Institute in Washington. He also advised many other
organizations, including the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration and the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, he was named conservationist of the year by the
Connecticut Association of Conservation and Inland Wetlands
Commissions.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, Thacher is survived by three children, Ann
Thacher Tate of Stonington, Linda Thacher Visscher of Mystic and
Peter Jr., of Washington, and one granddaughter.

WITH 57TH PICK, JETS APPROACH DRAFT QUIETLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After two years of running a vacuum cleaner through
the college player draft to restock a failing franchise, the
resurgent Jets will go quietly into the annual selections next
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   They do not make a pick until the virtual end of the second
round _ No. 57. Overall, they have a total of eight choices,
including extra selections in the sixth and seventh rounds.
</P>
<P>
   They may have lost a first-round choice, but they gained Bill
Parcells. The NFL's commissioner, Paul Tagliabue, awarded the
Patriots the Jets' first-round pick for 1999 two years ago, when
Parcells was permitted to join the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Now Parcells is living with that decision, which in any event
has worked out better than owner Leon Hess could have imagined. The
Jets are coming off a 12-4 season, which ended with a loss in the
AFC championship game to the Denver Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Parcells wants a first-rounder. Who doesn't? He didn't
get one last year either, when he compensated the Patriots for
nabbing free agent Curtis Martin. ``I don't have the ammunition to
move up next week,'' Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   But that may be moot. The Jets have strengthened themselves with
off-season free-agent moves that improve the punter position (Tom
Tupa), outside linebacker (Roman Phifer), free safety (Steve
Atwater) and tight end (Eric Green).
</P>
<P>
   Now, they go into the draft looking for a guard, a cornerback, a
burly fullback, a speed receiver and, with luck, a quarterback of
the future. There is college depth at guard. And the Jets did
produce a remarkable rookie tackle last year in Jason Fabini, a
fourth-rounder.
</P>
<P>
   Among the interior linemen the Jets might still see at No. 57,
there are Doug Brzezinski of Boston College, Derrick Fletcher of
Baylor, Anthony Cesario of Colorado State and Brandon Burlsworth of
Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have done extensive research of this offensive-line
group,'' said Parcells. ``I just can't tell you how much work we've
done.''
</P>
<P>
   The offensive line produced spectacular protection for
quarterback Vinny Testaverde last season; after one victory he
pronounced it the best of his career. But the line often messed up
on the running game. Blown assignments _ some involving tight end
Kyle Brady _ and less-than-sterling execution contributed to Curtis
Martin's low average of 3.5 yards a carry.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells is leaving nothing to chance despite his low draft
pick. He even had running backs' coach Mo Carthon, and the Jets'
security chief, Steve Yarnell, investigate the controversial but
game-breaking Cecil Collins. He was expelled from Louisiana State
and McNeese State after legal run-ins.
</P>
<P>
   Would Parcells take him?
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd have to wait and see that,'' said Parcells with a grin.
``Obviously I wasn't sending those guys down for practice. I'm not
going to say what I would do.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Parcells does say that he wants depth at cornerback and a speed
receiver. Yet, unless a rare find is uncovered at receiver, or a
Fabini-type emerges for the line, no potential draftee at the other
Jets' need positions could offer immediate help. And in any event,
a quarterback so far down would be a project.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Parcells plans to look at Chris Miller, the former Rams'
quarterback who left football two years ago following a series of
concussions. But Parcells believes several more quality veteran
backups at quarterback will be available in June.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his pessimism about getting a higher draft pick,
Parcells admits he would listen to trade talk that included draft
choices, especially involving his running backs. Excluding Curtis
Martin, the backs currently on the Jets are Leon Johnson, Robert
Farmer, Richie Anderson or Jerald Sowell.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Atwater's arrival has repercussions for two Jets:
Kevin Williams, the rookie who started at free safety the early
part of the year, and Scott Frost, the former Nebraska quarterback
who saw limited action at strong safety.
</P>
<P>
   Williams will be a backup cornerback, and Frost will be groomed
at free safety. Because of Frost's size _ 6 feet 3 inches and 219
pounds _ and football skills, Parcells drafted him on the third
round last year and saw visions of a marauding free safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want him to learn under Atwater,'' said Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   Frost is one of 16 players from Parcells' first two drafts still
on the Jets and is a performer who the coach fantasizes can be an
impact player.

SPORTS COLUMN: WILLIAMS SYMBOLIZED THE NETS  
</HEADLINE>

 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Imagine you're an impressionable kid out of the
University of Maryland in the early 1980s, looking for friends with
similar interests at your new job. You're reliable, responsible and
mature for 22.
</P>
<P>
   Your new friends are, well, not quite there yet.
</P>
<P>
   You are Buck Williams, in the passenger seat of a speeding
vehicle driven by that rascal Micheal Ray Richardson. Your tardy
teammate is approaching 100 miles an hour down Route 17 en route to
Newark Airport, chatting away. Inches from the divider, you are in
danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike!'' you yell. ``Stop looking at me when you talk. Look at
the road, you fool. I'll talk. You drive.''
</P>
<P>
   If you are blessed and lucky, you make it to the team plane _
where that mischievous Darryl Dawkins is informing anyone who will
listen that he is not of this Earth, but instead from ``Lovetron,
baby. You know the planet.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, to be an 80s kind of Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``You needed strong parents to stay sane,'' Williams said,
laughing last week. ``Those were crazy times,'' he added. ``Crazy,
but fun times. Good memories, too. All good.''
</P>
<P>
   If you are indeed blessed and lucky, you play 17 more seasons in
the NBA, buy those strong parents their dream home, send your son
to the same Greenwich, Conn., private school that President Bush
attended and retire with the same dignity you came into the league
with in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets will raise Williams' No. 52 jersey to the Continental
Arena roof Sunday. Fittingly, the team Williams finished his career
with _ the Knicks _ will be in attendance. And some kid with a
Stephon Marbury jersey will ask some kid with a Keith Van Horn
jersey, ``Who's that?'' You only hope their parents will tell them.
</P>
<P>
   Before becoming an NBA finals cog in Portland and an invaluable
role player in New York, Williams was the Nets. Eight years, 635
games, 10 team records and more than 10,000 points and nearly 8,000
rebounds. More than that, he was a rock, a stabilizing force for
every team on which he played.
</P>
<P>
   Especially for those wacky kids off the New Jersey Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darryl should have done standup comedy,'' Williams said of the
colorful center. ``He was a real approachable guy, an ambassador. I
learned a lot from him about dealing with people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows he used to call himself `Chocolate Thunder.'
But the nights he didn't play well, we'd say he was Chocolate
Blunder.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams calls Richardson, the All-Star shooting guard who was
suspended from the league for drug use and still plays in Europe,
his most loyal teammate. He does not remember a more flammable
player than the Richardson, who took the court against the 76ers in
1984, the season the Nets shocked the defending world champions in
a first-round series.
</P>
<P>
   There are other memories: Larry Brown's beckoning him after
practice in those first seasons, saying, ``Young fella, we need to
work on some low-post moves.'' Stan Albeck's giving him and his
teammates the freedom to create on the floor. And that revolving
roster that always kept turning around Williams, the one grounded
player, the descendant of share-croppers who rose from the cotton
fields of Rocky Mount, N.C., and grew into one of the game's
premier rebounders.
</P>
<P>
   His desire to claim a loose ball was trumped only by his
professionalism and class at a time when the NBA sorely needed
both.
</P>
<P>
   At the ceremony Sunday, Williams will be accompanied not only by
his wife, Mimi, and their two boys, Julien, 9, and Malek, 6, but
also by his three siblings, Cynthia, Ann and Clyde Williams. He
wishes his parents could be there, too.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Moses Williams, died two years ago at 83, three
years after Buck's mother, Betty, who was 68.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at your peers and then you see how you turn out, and
you reflect back and realize what kind of people they really
were,'' he said of his parents. ``That's the one missing element.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Buck, they were workers, picking cotton and tobacco when
they both were young. Moses, one of the smartest men Buck knew, had
but a third-grade education.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was really bright, but he was left-handed,'' Buck said.
``In those days, they wouldn't allow you to write left-handed. The
teacher would crack him on his left hand every time he tried. He
became so frustrated. They needed help on the farm. So he left
school.''
</P>
<P>
   Moses became a concrete finisher and Betty a homemaker.
</P>
<P>
   In a better story than any he could cull from his playing days,
Buck related this one:
</P>
<P>
   His father was working on a set of cement steps outside a new
deluxe home in Rocky Mount, leveling off the concrete just so. The
supervisor of the construction firm, who was white, told Buck's
father not to be so fussy and perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry about it, Moses,'' he said. ``You won't be living
here. It's too expensive for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Moses Williams, proud he had given Buck a better life than he
had himself, told his grown son this story 17 years ago on those
same concrete steps. That day, with money from his first
professional contract, Buck had bought the home for his parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to get him to sell the house for years and move into
something bigger, but he wouldn't do it,'' Buck said. ``Too much
sentimental value, I guess.''

 &HT;    Students taught by properly certified teachers tend to pass
TAAS, study shows
 &HT;    By A. Phillips Brooks
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Elementary students in schools with properly
certified teachers _ those teaching in their licensed fields _ were
more likely to pass the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills than
their peers in schools that employed uncertified teachers or those
teaching out of their field, a new statewide analysis shows.
</P>
<P>
   The study, the first in Texas to explore the relationship
between teacher certification and student performance on the TAAS,
does not prove conclusively that a student's ability to pass the
test is directly tied to teacher certification. But researchers who
performed the analysis say it suggests that there is a link.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence is pretty clear that teacher certification
matters,'' said Uri Treisman, director of the Charles A. Dana
Center at the University of Texas. Treisman conducted the analysis
and will brief legislators Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are likely to influence major educational policies
Texas lawmakers are considering _ from bills to end social
promotions and increase teacher pay to proposals requiring schools
to tell parents when their children are taught by improperly
certified teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got all this push for accountability, and we've been
leaving out the teacher,'' said Rep. Dianne White Delisi
(R-Temple), who has introduced several bills aimed at enticing more
people into teaching.
</P>
<P>
   About a fifth of the state's students _ 760,000 out of 3.8
million _ were in classes where teachers were not certified in the
1996-97 school year, the analysis showed.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, that meant teachers teaching outside their fields
_ English teachers teaching algebra, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   But it also includes professionals embarking on a second career
without formal instruction in education and teachers who have not
yet received their certification.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis by the Dana Center, based on 1996-97 school year
figures provided by the State Board for Educator Certification and
the Texas Education Agency, examined certification of teachers in
elementary, middle and high school and TAAS passage rates for
students in grades three through five.
</P>
<P>
   It showed that at elementary schools where all of the teachers
were properly certified, students tended to pass the TAAS at higher
rates than their peers at schools where significant numbers of
teachers were uncertified or improperly certified.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis also found that the shortage of properly certified
teachers was more acute in some courses, such as bilingual
education and computer classes.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the students in bilingual elementary classes and
secondary computer science classes were taught by uncertified or
improperly certified teachers.
</P>
<P>
   And high schools with large populations of low-income students
were less likely to have certified teachers than schools with fewer
low-income students, Treisman concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Treisman's analysis comes in the wake of several national and
state studies that increasingly point to the teacher as a major
factor in student achievement. Some researchers are now saying the
teacher is the single most important influence in learning,
surpassing even socioeconomic factors once held out as the key
agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that unquestionably matters most is good teachers,''
said Kati Haycock, director of the Education Trust, a Washington
research and advocacy group for low-income students. ``It's the
single most important variable in instruction.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, teachers groups and school administrators have
debated whether it makes a difference if students are taught by
properly certified teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Education leaders have downplayed the problem in Texas, where
hundreds of thousands of students every year are in classrooms
taught by improperly certified teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet no one is required to tell parents when their children are
taught by teachers the state says are not adequately prepared. And
administrators are not volunteering the information for fear of
setting off alarms among parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is telling parents that schools are employing teachers
who are not credentialed in their fields,'' said Haycock.
</P>
<P>
   ``This the deep, dirty secret of American education.''
</P>
<P>
   Because schools with more affluent students are more likely to
get certified teachers than campuses with poorer students, Treisman
said the analysis raises ``very deep and profound questions about
equity: Whose children have access to which teachers?''
</P>
<P>
   In his freshman calculus class, Treisman said, he sees the
results of uncertified or improperly certified teachers among
students who graduated in the top 10 percent of their high school
class. Students with access to certified or experienced math
teachers took advanced math classes in high school, including
calculus, he said. Students with lesser-qualified or uncertified
math teachers took fewer honors math classes primarily because the
schools did not have teachers to instruct those classes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That trend is not unique to Texas. Nationally, schools with high
enrollments of low-income students tend to get the most uncertified
teachers or those who are teaching out of their field, Haycock
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see very clearly is, the poorer the school or the
more kids of color, the less-qualified teachers are,'' she said.
``We routinely are taking the kids who are most dependent upon
their teachers for content learning and we're systematically
assigning them teachers with the weakest content base.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers groups say the analysis confirms what they've known for
years. ``These kids are hit with a triple whammy,'' said John Cole,
president of the Texas Federation of Teachers. ``They are in a
low-wealth school district from an impoverished family and end up
with a teacher who stays one chapter ahead of the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Corpus Christi teacher Adrian Fernandez can tell you how it
happens.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Fernandez stepped into his first classroom ready
to use the reading-instruction skills he spent four years honing in
college. But Woodlawn Elementary School needed a third-grade math
teacher. Fernandez, hired as a reading teacher, became a math
teacher by default. That also is how the inexperienced teacher
became the curriculum director for all third-grade math
instruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had less than two weeks to prepare for my first math
lesson,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Treisman stopped short of saying certified teachers are the most
effective teachers, and no one is claiming certification trumps
experience or other training. But he and others say certification
is a key indicator of a teacher's qualifications and preparation
for the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not every student who fails to learn is the result of bad
teaching,'' Cole said. ``But you can't teach what you don't know.
That is why certification matters.''
</P>
<P>
   School officials say they prefer to hire properly certified
teachers because they are typically better-trained in their field
than other teachers.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a certified high school math teacher has completed
18 semester hours of college mathematics courses, about six
courses. But schools can hire an English teacher who has completed
only six hours _ two courses _ in math to teach an algebra,
geometry or calculus class.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is there aren't enough certified teachers to go
around. A booming economy has compounded the teacher shortage,
especially of certified math and science teachers, who are trading
the classroom for offices _ and fatter paychecks _ in the high-tech
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with those factors, lawmakers are not likely to eliminate
exemptions that allow uncertified or improperly certified teachers
_ and in some cases totally unqualified teachers _ into Texas
classrooms. Principals would be unable to open many classrooms each
year if exemptions were outlawed, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``School districts aren't hiring uncertified teachers by choice;
they are doing it out of necessity,'' said David Dunn, a spokesman
for the Texas Association of School Boards.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Delisi said superintendents in her Central Texas district
recruit heavily, even outside Texas, but still can't fill their
classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are using teachers who may not hold the right
certificate, or in some cases, worse _ substitutes,'' Delisi said.
``And you know what the qualifications are for subs _ nada.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers groups are pushing for legislation requiring schools to
tell parents when their children are being taught by uncertified or
improperly certified teachers _ a move they hope will spur
legislators to address what they say are the root causes of the
teacher shortage: low pay and poor benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents need to be told when an uncertified teacher is
teaching their child so they can rally with us to fix the
problem,'' said Amy White, president of the Association of Texas
Professional Educators.
</P>
<P>
   A similar measure is pending in Congress, which would require
school districts receiving federal dollars to provide parents that
information.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little desire to pass such legislation in Texas
this session, several state leaders said. ``It's not racing through
the Legislature,'' said State Board of Education member Will Davis
of Austin.
</P>
<P>
   To attract and retain more educators, teachers' groups want
legislators to approve a $6,000 across-the-board pay raise to bring
their average $33,648 annual salary from 38th in the nation to the
national average. That proposal has not taken off, either, though
Senate Education Committee Chairman Teel Bivins has proposed a
measure that would give teachers about $2,000 more in take-home pay
by reducing their contribution to their retirement.
</P>
<P>
   And Delisi has introduced a package of incentives aimed at
attracting more college students to the teaching profession and
encouraging teachers to contain their training throughout their
careers.
</P>
<P>
   Some say more is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason we have been unwilling to bite the bullet, to
pay the salaries, provide the benefits, to do what it takes to get
our children qualified teachers,'' said Jane Conoley, dean of the
Texas A&AMP;M University College of Education.

BISHOP LEADS ABORTION PROTEST ON LONG ISLAND  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN T. McQUISTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHTOWN, N.Y. _ Signaling his willingness to maintain a highly
visible role in the fight against abortion, Bishop James T. McHugh,
the new spiritual leader of Long Island's 1.3 million Roman
Catholics, led a peaceful rally here Saturday morning outside a
Planned Parenthood clinic.
</P>
<P>
   The protest began with a morning Mass at St. Patrick's Roman
Catholic Church here, where McHugh called on 700 members of the
congregation to pray for an end to abortions and ``for the removal
of this dark stain that has cast a blight across our great
country.''
</P>
<P>
   He then led a procession of 250 parishioners from the church to
the clinic. Along the way, the marchers prayed the rosary and
intoned readings from the Stations of the Cross and the ``Prayer
for Life,'' which speaks of ``the vast number of children who have
not been born.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased that Bishop McHugh is now with us,'' said Mary
Murphy, of Central Islip, who pushed a stroller carrying her
3-year-old daughter, Megan. ``Abortion is a terrible sin.''
</P>
<P>
   They marched down East Main Street, past the Smithtown Library,
then turned left onto Maple Avenue, where they stopped in front of
the Planned Parenthood medical center. There were 20 patients
inside, said Francine Stein, the president and chief executive of
Planned Parenthood Hudson Peconic, which operates 15 centers in
Suffolk, Putnam, Rockland and Westchester Counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We honor their right to have different beliefs,'' Ms. Stein
said as she watched the prayer vigil from a second-floor window of
the clinic. ``We have no problem with people who protest
peacefully. It's a reaffirmation of the pluralism in our society,
one of freedom and tolerance. We only object when they interfere
with our patients and when they frighten and anger them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stein said three patients who had been scheduled for
Saturday morning decided to reschedule because of the protest.
``This is not an ordinary Saturday morning for us,'' she said. ``We
usually have a group of about two dozen protesters, but they only
occasionally bother the patients. Sometimes we even take them
coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stein was joined at the clinic by six members of a group
called Clergy for Choice, who expressed their support for the work
of Planned Parenthood, which serves more than 33,000 clients at its
15 centers, providing contraceptives, pregnancy tests and
counseling, tests for sexually transmitted diseases, breast exams,
Pap tests, prenatal care and first-trimester abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moral decisions like this cannot be legislated,'' said Clark
Berge of the Episcopalian Society of St. Francis Little Portion
Friary in Mount Sinai. ``The right to choose is sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Noelle Damico of the Congregational United Church of
Christ in Mount Sinai said that Planned Parenthood clinics provided
a variety of services for women. ``Abortion is only one of those
choices, and one that should be considered as a last resort.'' she
said. ``But women should have that choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's protest marked the first active leadership role at a
Long Island abortion rally by McHugh, who was appointed by the
Vatican last December as the coadjutor bishop. He will eventually
succeed the Most Reverend John R. McGann as the bishop of the
Diocese of Rockville Center, which comprises Nassau and Suffolk
Counties.
</P>
<P>
   McHugh was formerly the director of the Family Life Bureau and
the Pro-Life Office of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops
in Washington and is credited with developing the church's
political and legal opposition to Roe vs. Wade in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Last week he joined McGann and six other bishops in condemning a
lawsuit filed by New York State Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer
aimed at keeping the antiabortion group Operation Save America from
blocking access to abortion clinics in western New York during a
weeklong protest April 18-25.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lawsuit denies the right of free speech and denies the
right of public assembly,'' McGann said in a statement distributed
at this morning's service in St. Patrick's Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``All people have the right to express their positions civilly
and peacefully on issues affecting human life,'' he said, urging
the parishioners to join the morning's march.

GOP FINDS ALLIES IN SEEKING EASIER ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP RULES IN
NEW YORK
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ New York's business leaders have long worked with
their Republican allies in the Capitol in an unsuccessful campaign
to scale back rules requiring companies to conduct extensive
cleanups of polluted industrial sites that they want to develop.
</P>
<P>
   But now business has found a new ally: black and Hispanic
Democrats from poor inner-city neighborhoods where developers say
they would transform abandoned industrial sites into attractive
commercial properties if it were not for the state's stringent
environmental rules.
</P>
<P>
   While business groups and minority leaders differ over the
details of the changes they support, there is growing agreement
that the environmental rules may be stifling economic growth in the
state's inner cities as well as other industrial centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see these properties languish when we have such needs in
our community makes you question the principles that we have
operated under with regard to environmental protection,'' said
Jeffrion L. Aubry, a prominent black Democratic assemblyman from
Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to maintain standards of protection for your
community,'' he added. ``But at the same time you want to see these
properties put back into some economic use. So the question is: how
do you spur development of these properties in our community and at
the same time retain the public protections?''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is expected to be one of the most hotly contested
environmental matters the governor and the Legislature take up this
year. The main element in the state's effort to clean up hazardous
waste sites, the Superfund program, is running out of money, and
business leaders are pushing to overhaul its rules and standards as
part of any final agreement to refinance it.
</P>
<P>
   The budding alliance involving minority politicians, business
leaders and civic leaders threatens to fracture the traditional
Democratic alliance with environmentalists and give momentum to
those who want to see the standards eased.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats and their allies in the environmental community
have generally held that polluted former industrial properties,
known as brownfields, should be cleaned to a fairly high standard
and that the companies that own them should pay the costs, even if
a previous owner was primarily responsible for the contamination.
</P>
<P>
   Business, in turn, has argued that a high cleanup standard is
not needed for brownfields that will be used for factories instead
of homes and that holding property owners fully responsible for the
cleanup costs, no matter their role in the pollution, is sure to
inhibit investment. As evidence, they point to thousands of
industrial tracts that they say have been shunned by developers
because of concerns over legal liability for pollution and
contamination.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over brownfields comes as aides to Gov. George
Pataki, a Republican, are preparing legislation to overhaul the
laws governing liability and cleanup standards, ranging from sites
with relatively little toxic waste to those deemed hazardous enough
to qualify for money under the state Superfund program. Pataki and
his aides said he intended to introduce a bill in the current
legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   The major questions in the debate over brownfields include
whether prospective developers should be granted liability
protections from unforeseen cleanup costs and whether the state
should continue to require all polluted properties to be cleaned to
a single high standard or instead should make the standards
dependent on a site's eventual use. Put another way, does a
brownfield being used to build a gas station need to be as clean as
one being used for a nursery school?
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Shepard, the executive director of the West Harlem
Environmental Action Group, said she supported many of the changes
being sought by business leaders because the current laws are not
working.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many people who argue that brownfields should be
cleaned up to pristine conditions,'' Ms. Shepard said. ``And in a
perfect world, we would like to return some of them to pristine
conditions. But I think the bottom line should be a cleanup that
protects public health while promoting economic development.''

COBBLESTONED HILLS TO TEST MONCASSIN'S AILING BACK  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France, Germany, Belgium, Italy )   By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Because Frederic Moncassin has a bad back, one of the
last things he ought to be doing this past week is bouncing along
on a bicycle over cobblestoned roads and feeling the jolts roll up
his arms, through his shoulders and into his lumbar region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oof,'' he said, referring to his ride last Sunday in the Tour
of Flanders over 16 cobblestoned hills. ``Too hard. I had to drop
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he came back for more pounding Wednesday in the
Ghent-Wevelgem race in Belgium, where he placed 25th among 124
finishers. On Sunday, he will face the ultimate: the 97th
Paris-Roubaix classic, which includes 51.5 kilometers (32 miles) of
cobblestones in its total of 273 kilometers (169 miles). That's
more than twice the distance over cobblestones as in both races in
Belgium combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to Paris-Roubaix,'' of course, Moncassin
said on the phone this past week from Ghent, where his Credit
Agricole team was staying before it moved down to France for
Paris-Roubaix. ``At least it's flat, not like all those hills in
the Tour of Flanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my favorite race,'' the Frenchman continued. ``Always has
been. Every French boy dreams of winning the Tour de France and
Paris-Roubaix.''
</P>
<P>
   Since he is neither a strong climber nor a rapid time trialer,
Moncassin will never come close to winning the Tour, although in
1996 he did wear the overall leader's yellow jersey for a day
during the first week's flat stages.
</P>
<P>
   Paris-Roubaix is a different story for a rider known for his
aptitude for the cold and rainy races of Belgium and northern
France. It's a tough man's race _ most of the top 20 in the sport
will skip it _ and Moncassin, for all his friendliness and habitual
cheerfulness, is a tough man.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old Frenchman has come close to victory in
Paris-Roubaix, finishing eighth twice, 11th once and fifth last
year when a teammate, Magnus Baeckstedt, a Swede, paced him for a
long part of the day, letting Moncassin ride in his slipstream and
save his energy.
</P>
<P>
   That is unlikely to happen on Sunday. Teamwork is vital in
Paris-Roubaix, where a minor rider often has to give a wheel or
even his bicycle to a leader after one of the many crashes and
flats that always mark the race. But this year Moncassin will not
be a protected leader.
</P>
<P>
   As he admitted, his condition is not what it should be and the
team will concentrate its attentions on Stuart O'Grady, an
Australian.
</P>
<P>
   ``O'Grady has top form, is going strong,'' Moncassin said. ``Me,
I'm only moderate.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is his back, which he injured late last spring when
he crossed the finish line in the Four Days of Dunkirk race and
collided with a photographer standing in a prohibited zone.
Sprinting with his head down and never seeing the photographer,
Moncassin fell heavily.
</P>
<P>
   The crash was just another in a list of jinxes. In 1994, he
twisted a foot while coming down from the stage where teams in the
Tour de France were being introduced the night before the race
began; the result was a tendon injury that prevented him from
starting. In 1997, in an early sprint finish of the Tour, he was
first head-butted by Erik Zabel, a German rival, and then skulled
by a water bottle thrown at him by Tom Steels, a Belgian, in the
mistaken assumption that Moncassin had interfered with him; Zabel
was deprived of his victory and Steels was expelled from the race.
The rattled Moncassin never again was a factor in sprints.
</P>
<P>
   In his best year, 1996, Moncassin was one of the top French
sprinters, registering four victories that included the sprinter's
crown jewel, the Tour de France stage into Bordeaux.
</P>
<P>
   But the next year, and every year since, victory has evaded him.
Despite seven second places, including the vaunted Tour of
Flanders, and nine third places, including the equally prestigious
Milan-San Remo classic, he was zero for 1997 and 1998 in the
victory column.
</P>
<P>
   This season has started no better. ``Maybe Sunday,'' he said,
sounding unconvinced.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates are pulling for him. ``A really good fellow,''
O'Grady calls Moncassin. In a country not remarked for its
friendliness to foreigners, Moncassin has helped many of them on
his own and other teams to settle near him in the south.
</P>
<P>
   Tough men like him, these friends and neighbors will also be
riding in Paris-Roubaix. Like Moncassin, they know its golden rule.
``Try to avoid crashes,'' he said. ``Flats, you can't prevent on
all those cobblestones.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those cobblestones,'' he repeated, and even over the phone
he could be heard shuddering.

</P>
<P>
   Some comments from Larry Faulkner during his first year as
president of the University of Texas:
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see is what you get. I think I'm fairly
straightforward.''
</P>
<P>
   In a March 26, interview
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas as a society places a greater emphasis on athletics than
other societies, more than Illinois but maybe not more than
Michigan. The trick is to carry it out without corrupting the
character of the institution. Athletics is very powerful as a tool
for unifying a community. That's why universities put up with all
that they do.''
</P>
<P>
   March 26 interview
</P>
<P>
   ``As many of you are aware, when students are gone is one of the
nicest times on a university campus.''
</P>
<P>
   To members of the American Astronomical Society visiting UT
during winter break, Jan. 6
</P>
<P>
   ``I will bet this university will be here after a large number
of enterprises in this room are not.''
</P>
<P>
   To high-technology executives at the Alpha.360 Summit, Jan. 5
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that America and Texas will be healthier if we can
find methods that do not involve race as a criterion in admissions
or financial aid, yet succeed in promoting inclusion and diversity
as well as (or better than) the established race-sensitive
policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Written statement on affirmative action, Nov. 16, 1998
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us make this place more than a university of the first
class. Let's take it to the head of the class. . . . Our
competition is intelligent, experienced and visionary. We must not
deceive ourselves that we will be able to compete consistently,
year after year, for the talent and facilities that Texas needs
against the best universities in America with 70 percent of their
resources.''
</P>
<P>
   State of the University speech, Oct. 6, 1998
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real jewel of a university, and my priority as its
president will be to keep it that way and to help the people of
Texas understand what they have in this marvelous place.''

EDITORIAL: WAR IN AN ERA OF ETHNIC CONFLICT 
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, April 11:
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on NATO's setbacks in Kosovo, former Sen. Sam Nunn
dryly observed on NBC's ``Today'' show that the alliance has so far
proved to be less effective at waging war than it was at deterring
one during the long confrontation with the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   With Congress reconvening this week, a noisy debate over NATO's
strategy and performance is sure to be joined. It ought to be
informed by a realistic sense of the limitations of air power and a
healthy appreciation for the complexities of this conflict.
Important lessons can already be gleaned from this war that may
help the United States and its allies prevail in Yugoslavia as well
as future conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the ragged start in the Balkans, NATO air supremacy
should be sufficient over time to grind down Serbian resistance and
bring Slobodan Milosevic to a political settlement. The pace has
been slowed in part by bad weather and a decent regard for the
safety of NATO pilots.
</P>
<P>
   But in an era when air power is the preferred form of American
armed intervention abroad, it is apparent that the Pentagon needs
to develop more effective and varied ways to use its arsenal of
warplanes, cruise missiles and precision bombs. It may also need to
adjust the mix of weapons it buys and maintains, and be ready to
deal with an exodus of refugees that often materializes when ethnic
conflicts suddenly intensify.
</P>
<P>
   The allure of air power dates back to the second World War,
though it has often proved less decisive than its champions hoped
at winning conflicts or changing enemy minds. But since the heavy
casualties and domestic political upheavals of the Vietnam War,
American leaders have understandably limited their use of ground
troops, relying instead on bomb and missile attacks. Even in the
Persian Gulf War, the allied land invasion of Kuwait and Iraq was
preceded by more than a month of intense aerial bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, policy-makers and military planners assigned air
forces to achieve military and political objectives that were at
least initially difficult to attain with the chosen weapons and
tactics. That was based in large part on an expectation, shared by
this page, that Milosevic would likely retreat quickly in the face
of a NATO attack. In late 1995, NATO bombing in Bosnia, along with
Croatian military gains on the ground, brought him to Dayton to
make peace.
</P>
<P>
   A critical part of military planning is preparing for the
unexpected, and it now appears that NATO did not assemble enough
air power to intensify the bombing of military targets if Milosevic
failed to buckle. The alliance had threatened to use military power
for months, giving itself plenty of time to assemble forces. A
larger fleet of planes might have allowed NATO to damage Serbian
air defenses more quickly and move on to other targets. Dozens of
additional planes have been sent to the region in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Slowing the Serbian rampage through Kosovo has been especially
difficult. The ferocity and velocity of the assault surprised the
alliance, and air power is not the most effective way to combat
dispersed ground forces in mountainous, heavily forested terrain.
The American planes designed to maneuver through or above
well-defended air space _ stealth aircraft and high-performance
fighter-bombers _ are ill-suited to deal with infantry and tanks
that are best attacked at low altitude and low speed.
</P>
<P>
   The weapons made for such warfare, including A-10 attack planes
and Apache helicopters, are more vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire
and missile defenses and were not designed to operate deep in enemy
territory. The Pentagon must try to develop air weapons and
reconnaissance systems that can operate in the kinds of conditions
that exist in Kosovo, a battlefield of ethnic conflict that is sure
to become increasingly common in the years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is running short of cruise missiles that are
launched from B-52 bombers. Given the extensive use of these
weapons in recent conflicts, the Pentagon and Congress should have
watched the inventory more closely and ordered replacements or
conversions.
</P>
<P>
   In future ethnic conflicts, the United States and its allies
will have to be better prepared to handle hordes of displaced
people. Governmental resources, including military units, will need
to be committed in advance to the effort. Having made the
defensible decision to rely primarily on air power in regional
conflicts that do not immediately threaten American security,
Washington will need to be as imaginative and agile as possible in
fighting such wars and in preparing for their repercussions.  &QL;

 &HT;    Teacher certification requires degree, tests
 &HT;    By Staff reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ To be certified, or licensed, to teach in Texas,
candidates must:
</P>
<P>
   _ Have a bachelor's degree.
</P>
<P>
   _ Complete a state-approved teacher-education program at a
university or an alternative program run by some colleges, large
school districts and Texas Education Agency regional service
centers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pass certification exams testing their knowledge of their
content area and of teaching methods.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching without certification
</P>
<P>
   School districts are allowed to hire uncertified teachers for
specific assignments. The districts must obtain special permits:
</P>
<P>
   _ Emergency permit: The teacher is not certified at all or not
certified at the correct grade level. Good for up to three years,
depending on how much training he or she lacks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Temporary classroom assignment permit: Teacher is certified
but not in the subject area in which he or she is teaching. Good
for one year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nonrenewable permit: The teacher has completed most
requirements for certification, except passing certification exams.
Good for six to 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   _ Temporary exemption permit: The teacher's previous assignment
no longer exists because of fluctuations in enrollment or course
offerings. Valid for one year.
</P>
<P>
   _ School district teaching permit: Issued by school district to
``unique, highly qualified persons.'' Requires a bachelor's degree
and work experience to match what will be taught. May be denied by
the state education commissioner. Valid indefinitely, but not
transferable across districts.
</P>
<P>
   Substitute teachers
</P>
<P>
   Districts can hire substitutes to teach classes temporarily or
for the long term when a teacher cannot be found. Districts often
use retired teachers or college graduates. But in many cases,
districts hire high school graduates who have little or no college
education.

US TO SEND 82 MORE PLANES TO AID NATO CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD AND ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Heeding warnings that an even ``greater
humanitarian disaster'' loomed for hundreds of thousands of ethnic
Albanians trapped in Kosovo than for the more than half million who
have fled the province in the past 18 days, the Pentagon announced
Saturday that 82 more US warplanes were joining NATO's air campaign
to crush Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon also, for the first time, said US reservists may be
called up in the campaign to stop Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic's ``ethnic cleansing'' _ a term coined by Serbs to
describe the forced removal of another ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
   The plight of ethnic Albanians hiding in the mountains and
forests of Kosovo is ``a bigger problem than the refugees here,''
said Ilaz Ramajli, a Kosovo official in Albania. ``The refugees
here arrived and do not have to fear for their lives. They are not
being attacked.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramajli, an aide to ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova,
pleaded for NATO to airdrop food and medical aid to the Albanian
Kosovars, who have been driven from their homes in the last two
weeks by Serb police and paramilitary units.
</P>
<P>
   US officials estimate that up to 750,000 ethnic Albanians are
displaced inside Kosovo, many in hiding, without food or adequate
clothing, and some the victims of atrocities. ``They aren't living
in luxury, and they aren't being treated very nicely,'' Major
General Charles Wald said at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   At NATO headquarters in Brussels, spokesman Jamie Shea said the
alliance was ``very concerned'' but had no ``miracle solution'' for
reaching the endangered Kosovar Albanians, many of whom were pushed
back into the country after Yugoslavia closed Kosovo's borders
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The US response is not an airdrop over Kosovo _ up to now such
low-altitude air missions have been considered too risky for
alliance pilots. Instead, the Pentagon is adding the 82 fighters,
tankers, and transports to the 400 aircraft it has already
committed to NATO to intensify the air war over Yugoslavia and its
Serbian province, Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The addition of these aircraft will . . . expand the number of
strikes over any 24-hour period and give us more deep-strike
capacity,'' said Pentagon spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon, adding that
he expected other NATO allies to enhance their forces in a matter
of days, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, it will allow us to increase the intensity of the
air campaign over Kosovo and Yugoslavia,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft, which were requested by the NATO commander,
General Wesley K. Clark, and will join some 200 other allied
warplanes in the force, include 24 F-16 fighters armed with HARM
antiradar missiles; 4 tank-killing A-10 Thunderbolt attack
aircraft; 6 radar-jamming EA-6B Prowlers; 39 KC-135s and 2 KC-10s,
both refueling tanker aircraft; and 7 C-130 transports. The
Pentagon has promised 24 Apache helicopter gunships, but Wald said
Saturday it could take a month for them all to be in operation.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon also said the expanding air campaign could require the
call-up of reserve military personnel. So far, enough reserve
tanker pilots have volunteered to fly support missions, ``but if we
reach a point where we exhaust the volunteer pool, then we probably
would have to seek a reservist call-up for pilots,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   Because certain other military specialties exist only in the
reserves, Bacon said ``it's conceivable'' there would have to be
additional calls on reservists.
</P>
<P>
   Even with signs that NATO was widening the war, cloudy weather
hampered its operations Friday night. Three out of four air
missions were canceled, said Colonel Konrad Freytag, a NATO
spokesman, though cruise missiles were fired from British and US
ships.
</P>
<P>
   Freytag confirmed that a NATO bomb struck a radio-relay tower at
Golec, near the Kosovo capital of Pristina. ``It was used mainly
for military purposes, that's why we took it out,'' Freytag said,
responding to complaints from Belgrade that the bombing knocked out
Serbian TV broadcasts in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials said they would not verify reports out of
Yugoslavia that NATO bombs fell on the airport at Slatina, south of
Pristina. Explosions also were heard at a military airport in the
capital of the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   As air-raid sirens sounded in Belgrade and civilians stood as
human shields on Serbian bridges, the official news agency Tanjug
said: ``NATO barbarians are attempting to bomb us just a few hours
before the Orthodox Easter celebrations.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said the air campaign was having an effect. ``In
the last two weeks we have inflicted a hell of a lot of damage,
quite frankly, on the Yugoslav armed forces,'' said Shea, the
spokesman. He estimated that half of the Serbs' MiG-29 aircraft had
been destroyed, as had two of its three major army headquarters, 50
percent of its fuel stocks, ``a lot'' of vehicles, and key elements
of Yugoslav command, control, and communications.
</P>
<P>
   Still, members of Congress from both parties who accompanied
Defense Secretary William S. Cohen to Brussels last week said they
don't believe a sustained air campaign would remove Serb forces
from Kosovo. Friday, they appealed to President Clinton to
reconsider his opposition to deploying ground troops in the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``While our focus is on accomplishing the current mission of
significantly degrading Milosevic's military capability through an
intense air campaign, we believe it is prudent for the US to urge
NATO to plan for additional military missions, including the use of
ground forces,'' the nine senators and representatives wrote in a
letter to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the president faces a domestic debate over the
military operation in Yugoslavia when Congress returns from a
two-week recess. He is scheduled to meet with groups of senators
and representatives Monday and Tuesday to explain the policy and
progress.
</P>
<P>
   In a Republican radio address Saturday, Representative Heather
Wilson of New Mexico said US policy ``has failed to achieve our
political objectives and accelerated the humanitarian disaster in
the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president owes us an explanation of what, exactly,
`winning' would mean, and what the costs would be, in dollars, yes,
but mostly in lives lost and dreams destroyed,'' said Wilson, a
former Air Force officer.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's foreign policy team met at the White House to review
the air war and reportedly remained steadfast against introducing
ground troops. The president believes ``we can achieve our
objectives through the phased air campaign,'' National Security
Council spokesman David Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
   But what Ramajli, the ethnic Albanian leader, called the
``greater humanitarian disaster'' _ starvation on the ground in
Kosovo _ complicates NATO's plans for a long and sustained air
campaign. NATO officials were weighing Yugoslavia's motives in
reopening Kosovo's borders with Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very possible that there will be a humanitarian
catastrophe in the forests,'' Ramajli said. ``The situation is
very, very bad, especially for ill people and old people. We had a
practice in Bosnia with NATO countries to drop humanitarian aid and
medical aid. I hope the countries will do the same here.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if food drops would lure Serb troops, he responded that
that danger ``always exists.''

   (NYT8) NAPLES, Fla. -- April 10, 1999 -- SKATE-SCANDAL, 4-10 --
Former skater Craig Maurizi, 36, who is now Tara Lipinski's coach,
has come forward to claim that his working relationship with
Richard Callaghan, one of the dominant figures in skating, involved
inappropriate sexual conduct with him when Maurizi was 15.
Callaghan, who has retained a lawyer, vehemently denies that he
ever had sex with Maurizi. ``I don't care how old a student is,
whether it's a boy or a girl, a coach should never have sex with a
student,'' says Maurizi. (Gary I. Rothstein/New York Times Photo)

schools have made explicit efforts to ensure that girls will not be

   (NYT8) NAPLES, Fla. -- April 10, 1999 -- SKATE-SCANDAL, 4-10 --
Former skater Craig Maurizi, 36, who is now Tara Lipinski's coach,
has come forward to claim that his working relationship with
Richard Callaghan, one of the dominant figures in skating, involved
inappropriate sexual conduct with him when Maurizi was 15.
Callaghan, who has retained a lawyer, vehemently denies that he
ever had sex with Maurizi. ``I don't care how old a student is,
whether it's a boy or a girl, a coach should never have sex with a
student,'' says Maurizi. (Gary I. Rothstein/New York Times Photo)

schools have made explicit efforts to ensure that girls will not be

late February, fires and production problems at refineries in the

 &HT;    Fans stake their claims in Augusta land rush
 &HT;    By Michelle Hiskey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ You don't have to go to Spain for the running of
the bulls. Just show up at Augusta National Golf Club a few hours
before the gates open.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of fans from all over the world congregate along
Washington and Berckmans roads, waiting for the gates to open and
their perennial sprint to their favorite spot on the course. For
diehard spectators, the best observation points are claimed hours
before the first player tees off.
</P>
<P>
   Clark Rogers flew in from San Francisco and stands inches away
from the green door just before 7 a.m. Saturday, just as he has for
five Masters. He clutches two chairs, one to sit on at the first
tee, the other for later at the 18th green.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as much tradition as anything,'' he says. ``But I don't
know if I want to tell my secrets to the newspaper. Then everyone
will know.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd around him grows belligerent, pointing to their
watches, peeking through a gap in the gate to yell at the Pinkerton
guards. ``Hello! Hello!'' they shout. ``The other gates are open!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the donuts we gave them didn't work,'' one fan
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Once allowed in, they hurriedly march through the parking lot,
only to wait another 30 minutes at the club entrance. The course
opens at 8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to tell y'all not to run,'' says an exasperated
security guard, ``but y'all are going to run anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be competitive,'' Rogers confides. ``They've said
`no running' for years, but people start to run anyway. And that's
a real bummer. When there was never anyone running there was an
equal chance to get your chairs set.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone clutches at least one folding seat, most of them green.
Next to the Masters badge, it's a fan's most critical accessory.
Fast feet help, too. A legend circulates about a 77-year-old man
who measured the distance between the entrance and his favorite
spot, and practiced running that span for several months. He got
there first.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone's got their strategy. ``You don't want to get boxed
out,'' says Drew Hoffman. He and three buddies grip a couple dozen
chairs destined for the 18th green, where clients of their Ohio
relocation service will sit.
</P>
<P>
   ``My future,'' adds Hoffman's coworker Tim Hinkley, ``depends on
that first row.'' It seemed inevitable that the popularity of the
Masters would spawn the corporate chair-saver.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the guards stand back and the fans pour forth. The
guards yell at them to walk, but after a few steps, they take off
again. In five minutes, there's a ring of seats six deep on the
18th green.
</P>
<P>
   Others make a beeline to the first tee, or fan out to the back
nine. They blow by the newcomers still clutching their maps, trying
to figure out which hole to go to. They are sweating and huffing
and puffing as they pop their seats up.
</P>
<P>
   Soon there are more folding chairs than at a college graduation.
At 8:21 a.m., it's hard to find a decent spot around the large,
par-3 16th green. Even though it's still being mowed and the hole
hasn't been cut, veteran spectators know Saturday's traditional pin
position is back right, and they cluster there.
</P>
<P>
   Some people have sat in the same spot so many years that they've
put down roots. Bland Massie, 71, of Fort Valley, kept up with the
vacations, children, divorces and deaths of nine friends he made in
20 years near the 15th green.
</P>
<P>
   The tradition ended this year when trees replaced the mound
where his group sat, and they scattered to other spots. Massie now
sits farther back on the 16th green, partly because he can't get
there as quickly. ``I ran until I was 69,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Once set up, a chair is more grounded than a pioneer's stake in
the Oklahoma land rush. Spectators move about freely in the hours
before the players appear, knowing that no one will move their
seat. It's a tradition as revered as the green jacket, because
everyone respects the perspiration and strategy involved in getting
it there.

COWBOYS SHOULD TAKE A LONG LOOK AT SHORT AGGIES LINEBACKER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ History is on Dat Nguyen's side. So is
geography. So, obviously, are college credentials.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a long story for the Cowboys, and the short version is
this: They blew it years ago on Baylor's Mike Singletary, who
wasn't tall enough by Valley Ranch computerized standards.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, it was Texas Tech's 5-foot-10 Zach Thomas who
failed to measure up to the ``mike'' (middle linebacker) minimum of
6-foot-1.
</P>
<P>
   Valley Ranch management of another era had to eat a load of crow
as Singletary was playing his way into the Pro Football Hall of
Fame. Gil Brandt is still wondering how that much heart was crammed
into a 5-10 frame. It simply didn't compute on Gil's P.C.
</P>
<P>
   Singletary was 90 miles down the road in Waco. The Cowboys had
four college seasons to watch him, but they never looked beyond
Singletary's supposed lack of height. In that same 1981 draft that
the Bears took Singletary in the second round, the Cowboys went
heavy for linebackers.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure you remember the likes of Scott Pelluer, 6-1; Derrie
Nelson, 6-2; Danny Spradlin, 6-1; Paul Piurowski, 6-2. When that
kind of tall-enough talent is available, why gamble on a runt from
Baylor?
</P>
<P>
   Three Aprils ago, Zach Thomas was still undrafted in the fifth
round when Jimmy Johnson grabbed him for the Dolphins. Even in his
rookie season, it was obvious the rest of the league screwed up on
Thomas, a bona fide football player. But again, he was in the
Cowboys' back yard, making the local miss doubly bad.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to Texas A&AMP;M's linebacking machine, Mr. Nguyen.
Along with many of the top college players in the country, Nguyen
was a Valley Ranch guest on Friday as the Cowboys were sizing up
talent for next weekend's NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   Among the linebackers, Rahim Abdullah of Clemson was here. He's
6-5. So was the highly acclaimed Chris Claiborne of USC, at 6-2.
And Northwestern's Barry Gardner, a tick under 6-1. And the huge
Andy Katzenmoyer of Ohio State, standing over 6-3. Another hot name
was Jevon Kearse of Florida, who is nearly 6-5 and also plays end.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was ``little'' Dat. Barely 5-11.
</P>
<P>
   So how do the Cowboys play this in the draft? Do they take a
blood oath not to miss out on another high-profile linebacker from
a Texas college, just because he's 5-11 instead of 6-1?
</P>
<P>
   But if they want Dat Nguyen, and every indication is they do,
then do you ``reach'' in the second round? Would he still be there
in the third? Could they wait until the fourth?
</P>
<P>
   One Valley Ranch voice said when the entire Cowboys draft team _
coaches, scouts and Jerry Jones _ broke down on film every
available linebacker, Nguyen was rated the most ``productive''
college player of all. But are the Cowboys scared of 5-11? Sure
they are.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Lacewell, the team's director of scouting, said, ``Here's
the deal on Dat Nguyen _ no matter what round he goes, the draft
gurus will immediately say it's too high, that it's a reach. But
wherever we take him, I don't care what the gurus will have to say
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after three months of intense personal scrutiny for this
draft, Nguyen could still laugh Friday when asked if he was weary
of being labeled ``too short.''
</P>
<P>
   ``God gave me 5-11 and told me that's what I had to work with,''
he replied. ``Actually, I'm proud of it. I'd like to be able to
stretch out to that prototype NFL size of 6-4, but there has never
been a perfect physical specimen in football. Even if you are 6-4,
there's always something that doesn't measure up.''
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen has been college football's special story. The son of
Vietnamese refugees who settled on the Texas coast, he will be the
first of his nationality ever to play in the NFL. And was only the
second to play major college football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it as a miracle ride so far, and no matter what
happens on draft day, some team is going to give me a chance. ...
at least I hope so,'' said Nguyen. ``In what round you are drafted
is obviously important. But for me, getting the opportunity is the
big thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen is currently 230 pounds, and despite some NFL clubs
saying he played at 215 at A&AMP;M, he laughed when told there were
reports he ``beefed up'' for the draft. So did R.C. Slocum, his
college coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dat was 230 here,'' said Slocum. ``Shortness is the only knock
any NFL team can have on Dat. He has the size, just not the height
the NFL likes. But all the other football credentials are there.
Plus, there will not be a player of higher personal character
involved in this or any other draft.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys want Dat Nguyen, 5-11 and all. By the draft's second
round on Saturday, we start finding out how much they regret
Singletary and Thomas.

RACE IS RIGHT ON TRACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALLEN WOLFE  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ There's something fishy going on with the
Long Beach Grand Prix course this year.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing sinister or suspect; it's just that the downtown
Long Beach street circuit has been modified and lengthened since
last year's race, so a portion of the track will loop around the
new Aquarium of the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic change is in the turn 1 area at the end of the
Shoreline Drive straightaway. Instead of turning right into the
Pine Avenue parking area, drivers will take a sharp left turn and
proceed in a loop around the aquarium complex. Seven new turns had
to be created to complete the process before linking up with
Seaside Way.
</P>
<P>
   The revised city-street circuit is now 1.85 miles and 11 turns
as opposed to last year's configuration of 1.59 miles and eight
turns. Surprisingly, only grandstands 2, 5, 6 and 7 were affected
by the change.
</P>
<P>
   It took nine weeks for Dwight Tanaka, vice president of
operations for the Grand Prix Association of Long Beach, and his
four foremen and crew of 30 to build the circuit. In addition to
the concrete barriers and safety fence, the track also features 21
spectator grandstands, six spectator-pedestrian bridges, 12
television/photo towers, eight big-screen vision boards and 61 VIP
corporate hospitality and viewing suites.
</P>
<P>
   This race marks Tanaka's 21st year as construction supervisor
and it proved to be one of his most challenging.
</P>
<P>
   ``We literally had to build a city within a city, with an
infrastructure capable of supporting 300,000-plus people,'' said
Tanaka. ``We take great pride in providing a world-class facility
for our competitors, sponsors and spectators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new course should be an exciting circuit for the drivers
and fans. With a longer front stretch down Shoreline (Drive), an
opportunity is present to reach higher speeds, then going into turn
1, drivers will have to brake hard to turn left and go around the
aquarium's parking facility. The additional turns will also make
for more competitive racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Many interested parties had to be satisfied before the project
could go ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to work closely with many city entities to decide what
the most challenging, exciting and safest course would be for
all,'' said Chris Pook, president and CEO of the Grand Prix
Association of Long Beach. ``This is the first change we have made
to the course since 1992. Officials from the City of Long Beach,
Aquarium, Shoreline Village, Oliver McMillan (developer of the
Queensway Bay project) and SMG (operators of the Long Beach
Entertainment and Convention Center) provided input.''
</P>
<P>
   The circuit safety system is unique and at the cutting edge for
city street events around the country. The basic safety elements
have remained unchanged since they were developed and introduced by
Dr. Peter Talbot, a Menlo Park doctor, for the first race in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The circuit is lined by 1,800 concrete blocks, each one 12 feet
long and weighing 8,100 pounds. All are fitted with debris fence
poles on which 10 miles of cable is tightly strung. Three miles of
catch fencing is then strapped in place above the blocks; the
result is a safety system that protects competitors and fans alike.
</P>
<P>
   Also lining the circuit are 250 tire crash barriers (64 tires
per pallet) that are strategically positioned at turns and runoff
areas. Dr. Talbot referred to the energy-absorbing tire piles as
``spherical elastic attenuators.'' &QL;

MOCHA EXPRESS ONE OF STARS FROM '98 BACK FOR RETURN TRIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas _ Every year at Lone Star Park at Grand
Prairie, new horses become stars.
</P>
<P>
   But for 1999, many stakes heroes from last year will be
returning for encores.
</P>
<P>
   Mocha Express was chosen horse of the meeting for last summer's
thoroughbred season, and is preparing to run April 18 in the Texas
Mile at Lone Star.
</P>
<P>
   Jockey Marlon St. Julien `` has been working him, and he seems
to be doing really good,'' trainer Tim Harder said.
</P>
<P>
   Mocha Express won the Lone Star Park Handicap and Assault Stakes
last season, and recently won a stakes on grass at Turf Paradise in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Artica, owned by Royce Roberts and trained by Tony Richey, is
expected to defend her Irving Distaff title on opening weekend. She
also won the Fort Worth Handicap at Lone Star last year.
</P>
<P>
   Richey is also bringing back Allen Bogan Memorial winner Chief
Three Sox, who recently took a fast allowance at Oaklawn Park.
</P>
<P>
   Mastery's Gamble is another being pointed for the Irving
Distaff. The 7-year-old mare notched victories in the Two Altazano
Stakes and Texas Legends Stakes a year ago at Lone Star.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a hard-knocking old gal,'' trainer Tommie Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   Again expected to be among the top filly-and-mare turf runners
is the consistent come-from-behinder Sarah Lane's Oates, coming off
a productive winter at Fair Grounds. Also back for more is
Spiritbound, the gutsy sprinter who won the 1997 Crescent Stakes
and 1998 Grand Prairie Gold Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Dallas Keen, who tied with Jim Gaston atop the races-won
standings last summer, could have one of the best older handicap
horses on the grounds in Allen's Oop, a long shot third-place
finisher in the New Orleans Handicap while only a neck behind Real
Quiet. He is scheduled to run next in the Texas Mile.
</P>
<P>
   Among other Keen stakes runners are 3-year-old filly Keenski and
3-year-old Valhol, a maiden who ran fourth in the Louisiana Derby
and was scheduled to compete yesterday in the Arkansas Derby.
</P>
<P>
   The stables of trainers Steve Asmussen and Mike Stidham should
again pack a powerful punch.
</P>
<P>
   Asmussen's stakes horses include turf mare Swearingen,
3-year-old filly Dreams Gallore, and female sprinters Little Sister
and Western Bowl. Stidham won three Texas Champions Day races last
fall with Letterhead, Lone Star Derby candidate Desert Demon and
Waynes Classy Girl, and they are expected to be joined at Lone Star
by Razorback Handicap winner Desert Air.
</P>
<P>
   Watch for Texas-bred sprinter Beverly Greedy, a winner of three
consecutive races at Oaklawn, to surface in Texas-bred stakes
races.
</P>
<P>
   And trainer Donnie Von Hemel could be loaded this summer, if
everything works according to plan.
</P>
<P>
   Burbank, Lone Star's champion grass horse of 1997, is in
training and will be ready to resume his career in early-season
Lone Star races.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took a break over the winter and took it easy down in
Florida like rich people do,'' Von Hemel said.
</P>
<P>
   Other familiar Von Hemel horses that could appear in stakes
races are Sir Tiff, Illusive Ghost, Leave A Legacy and Toll Booth
Willie.
</P>
<P>
   Custer, who took the Alysheba Breeders' Cup Stakes last May
before he was sidelined by surgery for a condylar fracture of a
leg, has suffered another training setback and probably won't be
seen until the latter part of the meeting, Von Hemel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can get them all to the races,'' Von Hemel said, ``they
could be a force.''

JOCKEY EDDIE MARTIN BETTER THAN EVER AFTER MISHAP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last time Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie fans saw jockey
Eddie Martin, he lay motionless on the infield grass course.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was thrown from his mount in a gruesome chain-reaction
spill last May 31. He hit the ground hard, and then apparently was
kicked in the head and trampled by a trailing horse.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the grandstand who witnessed the accident feared the
worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were saying, `Man, that dude's dead,' '' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Unconscious but alive, Martin was hurt badly enough that he
needed four months of recuperation and therapy before doctors
permitted him to return to the saddle. Despite those unpleasant
memories from his first Lone Star season, Martin, a 35-year-old New
Orleans native, is returning for the 1999 thoroughbred meet
beginning Thursday. He's not only competing again; he comes into
the Lone Star meet as one of the hottest jockeys in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Martin ranks ninth nationally in races won, 75, and 12th in
purses earned, $2,084,695. He finished second in the standings at
Fair Grounds in New Orleans with 98 winners, compared with 44 for
Marlon St. Julien, Lone Star's leading jockey last summer. Martin
also notched the biggest win of his career last month, guiding
Precocity to a New Orleans Handicap upset over Real Quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are really booming right now,'' Martin said. ``I've got
quite a few clients to work for, so I'm just hoping the Fair
Grounds meet can carry over into Lone Star.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was doing well last year, too, before I wiped out.'`
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who ran third at the Fair Grounds a year ago, has no
memories of the spill that nearly killed him. He has no
recollection of a conversation with trainer Bobby Barnett minutes
before the sixth race, or of leaving the gate aboard
Nightstargazer, whose legs became tangled with another horse
running into the first turn.
</P>
<P>
   When paramedics arrived at his side, Martin was unconscious. His
protective riding helmet was cracked in half, his shoulder was
dislocated, his nose was shattered and his face and head were
beginning to swell.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Dottie, who was six months pregnant at the time, had
spent that afternoon birthday-shopping in New Orleans for their
10-year-old son, Beau. When they returned to their house in Kenner,
La., their Caller ID unit registered 40 telephone calls from
friends in Kentucky, Illinois, West Virginia and even Canada who
had been watching the Lone Star race via simulcast.
</P>
<P>
   As the wife of a jockey, Dottie Martin said she ``pretty much
knew what had happened before I returned the calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Dottie was given only sketchy details of her husband's condition
over the phone. She couldn't get a flight to Dallas until 9 p.m.
When she finally arrived at Methodist Hospital, she was so
traumatized at the sight of her husband that she went into false
labor that night and had to be treated with medication to stop the
contractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was on a ventilator,'' she recalls, ``and he was one big
bruise from head to toe. I wasn't expecting that. Even the whites
of his eyes were swollen. I didn't know the whites of someone's
eyes could be swollen over the pupils, but they were.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors diagnosed Martin with severe swelling of the two frontal
lobes of his brain, the rough equivalent of a massive concussion.
He was fed intravenously and kept in a drug-induced coma for two
weeks to calm his movements and permit his injured brain to heal
properly.
</P>
<P>
   He responded only to an emergency-room nurse named Nicole, who
had been the first voice he heard upon arriving at the hospital.
She visited Martin to feed and shave him, even on her days off.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he finally came out \Rof the coma\S,'' Dottie said, ``at
first he was calling me Linda and Marilyn and Madison. He never did
get the name right. It's a good thing I don't know any of those
people.''
</P>
<P>
   As a younger rider, Martin had overcome occasional battles with
substance abuse, but coming back from these injuries was a far
different challenge. He was airlifted to a hospital in New Orleans
after coming out of his coma, and when finally released a month
after the accident, he was weak from inactivity. The reflexes so
important to his profession were as slow as those of a punch-drunk
fighter because of the nature of the injury and the heavy doses of
morphine he had received.
</P>
<P>
   A nurse told Martin that a bedridden person loses a percentage
of their strength for each day they are on their back.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I laid on my back for a good 25 days,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Lone Star's insurance company picked up the medical bills for
Martin, which totaled about $100,000. Still, the family went four
months without a paycheck, other than $275 weekly provided by
insurance and the Jockey's Guild. Martin said he was fortunate that
he had done well enough in the previous months to put money away as
a contingency.
</P>
<P>
   Martin underwent physical and occupational therapy during July,
August and September.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the worst part of all, getting him to calm down and
relax,'' Dottie said. ``Eddie's an active person, and he wasn't
allowed to drive or do anything physical, not even sweep outside.
He was real angry, thinking he was OK and they were telling him,
`No, you're not.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I could have returned a lot sooner than I did,''
Eddie said, ``but I had many neurosurgeons and doctors who were
very cautious about my recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   At last, Martin made it back to the races, riding a horse for
owner and trainer Louis Roussel on Sept. 28 at Louisiana Downs in
Bossier City. Two days later, daughter Alexandra was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a beautiful baby, and everything has worked out all
right,'' said Dottie, who nevertheless wishes her husband would
find a new line of work.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs is a happy ending that will get even happier this summer
if Martin can keep his hot streak going. At Lone Star, he is
expected to ride many of the horses trained by Roussel, Sam David
Jr., Tom Amoss and Troy Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got no hard feelings against Lone Star, and I'm looking
forward to returning,'' he said. ``A lot of people from the track
visited me in the hospital, and they even bought my son tickets to
Six Flags. Lone Star is first-class, and puts on a good show.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin seems most concerned that others at Lone Star who saw the
Memorial Day weekend wreck might feel sorry for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't like that,'' he said. ``People have to understand
that my job is so dangerous, things like this happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin could avoid pity by carrying with him a copy of the
latest national jockey standings.

COWBOYS ACCUSED OF DOING WHAT MANY TEAMS DO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No teams have admitted to ratting on the Cowboys and none are
likely to, either, since most have been guilty of the same thing
Jerry Jones is doing. Getting a verbal agreement, then working to
free up cap room has been common practice since the advent of NFL
free agency.
</P>
<P>
   Examples:
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee Titans agreed to terms with linebacker Eddie
Robinson on March 1. The contract wasn't filed with the league
until March 31.
</P>
<P>
   The Carolina Panthers agreed to terms with defensive end Antonio
Edwards on Feb. 20. It was officially reported on March 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cowboys are doing what a lot of teams do,'' said an NFL
personnel director who asked for anonymity. ``There's nothing
wrong. We all do it. You're trying to find ways to clear money
before you actually sign the players.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Quentin Coryatt has spent a lot of time at Valley Ranch,
but this off-season isn't the first time that's happened. Coryatt
and Cowboys cornerback Kevin Smith are best friends and former
college roommates at A&AMP;M. Coryatt has spent time living at Smith's
home and has accompanied him to work out at Valley Ranch on many
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret, however, that Coryatt and Rocket Ismail are
indeed house-shopping in the Valley Ranch area.
</P>
<P>
   The eventual signings of linebacker Coryatt, wide receiver
Ismail and center Mark Stepnoski will mark this off-season as the
franchise's biggest ever. The Cowboys have never before added three
bona fide star free agents, never added three starters or paid this
type of money at one time to multiple players.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, the Cowboys have focused on re-signing their own
free agents. These three players will fill three of the most
pressing needs on the team and will allow them to go into the draft
in position to take the best player available rather than drafting
for need as they have so often in the past.
HANSEN REALLY UNPLUGGED
</P>
<P>
   Dale Hansen, whose one-hour special Friday night on WFAA/Channel
8 was billed as the show that ``might get me fired,'' was livid
with his bosses after one of his wisecracks was cut from the final
product.
</P>
<P>
   ``How in the heck does the Dow Jones go from 7,500 to 10,000 in
six months,'' Hansen asked his live audience, ``and Belo \Rthe
company that owns Channel 8\S drops a buck and a half?''
</P>
<P>
   There was a mild titter from the audience, which set up Hansen's
real punchline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry, you don't have to laugh,'' Hansen shot back.
``That'll never make the air anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience roared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may get over this,'' Hansen fumed after learning of the cut,
``and I may not.''
</P>
<P>
   Who knows, the promo might still be right on the money.
NO HOME SWEET HOME
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth minor-league hockey scene is in disarray after
Fire owner Dave Elmore closed down his franchise, ostensibly
because of a ludicrous lawsuit filed by the Brahmas over the Fire's
grade-school program. Lawyers say the suit was sure to be thrown
out of court, but it gave Elmore, a reluctant owner anyway, the
perfect excuse to dump a franchise that had never made money in its
seven years here.
</P>
<P>
   This leaves the city to the Brahmas and Andy Moog _ the
franchise's majority owner is a New York broker named Stuart
Frasier, but Moog, the former Stars goalie, is the high-profile
minority owner _ but that's still an uneasy situation.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the city seems to give a hoot. The Brahmas have been
forced to play some of their playoff games in Plano and even in
Reunion Arena because the city has booked so many dates at either
the Convention Center or Will Rogers. The Brahmas have a right to
feel like orphans. They are essentially without a home.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be too shocked when Moog dumps this little experiment.
Most people in and around the situation say he is in this to gain
experience with hopes of jumping to the NHL and a nice front-office
position.
NOT JUST A NUMBER
</P>
<P>
   Rangers manager Johnny Oates was a backup Braves catcher in 1974
when Hank Aaron hit his record-breaking 715th home run. He was
standing just to Tom House's left when the then-Braves reliever
caught the most famous home-run ball in history.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody was paying much attention when Aaron later hit No. 726 in
Atlanta toward the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball hit the back wall \Rof the bullpen\S and rolled
away,'' Oates recalled. ``Nobody went after it. I strolled over and
put it in my back pocket, because I'm thinking, `Hey, this might be
his last one.' But he hit another one in San Diego, No. 727, into
the stands.'' (The next season, Aaron went over to the American
League with the Brewers and hit 22 more before his retirement.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I have that ball at home in my den _ I've only kept maybe
half-a-dozen things through the years _ and all it says on it is
the number sign and `726' that I wrote under the label, Official
National League Baseball.'''
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PROBLEM
</P>
<P>
   Former Ranger Mike Stanley, now with the Red Sox, was sitting in
his hotel room in Kansas City last weekend when ``I went into the
bathroom and water was streaming out of the ceiling above the light
fixture. I called up the front desk and said, `Houston, we have a
problem.' '' It seems that Red Sox rookie Lou Merloni, who had the
room just above Stanley, had turned on the hot water in the shower
to steam the wrinkles out of his pants. One problem: He didn't open
the drain before leaving to spend 40 minutes working out in a
health club.
</P>
<P>
   NEVER `LEFT' OUT
Two quotes emphasizing the importance of training your male
children to throw left-handed:
</P>
<P>
   Oakland and former Rangers pitcher Kenny Rogers: ``I don't want
to pitch until I'm 50, but I'm left-handed, so I guess I almost
could if I wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers general manager Doug Melvin on prospect Mike Venafro:
``Tom Schieffer asked me if he could pitch in the majors. I said,
`He's left-handed, and he's 23. He's got 17 more years to prove it.
He's got at least until he's Tony Fossas' age, doesn't he?''
DID YOU KNOW?
</P>
<P>
   Close friends of both say there's still been no reconciliation
between former Rangers and longtime friends Larry Parrish and Buddy
Bell after the relationship foundered once Parrish replaced Bell as
Tigers manager. ... Yankees owner George Steinbrenner still won't
return Don Zimmer's calls after the two clashed over whether Hideki
Irabu should be replaced in the rotation by Ramiro Mendoza. ...
</P>
<P>
   Ever the diplomat, former Ranger Will Clark made sure that two
cases of Bud Light were loaded on the Cuban bus after the Orioles'
exhibition game in Havana. ... Clark's wearing No. 12 with the
Orioles because his favorite number, 22, was once worn by Jim
Palmer and has been retired.
</P>
<P>
   TCU has joined the bidding on the WAC baseball tournament with
the idea of bringing in lights to attract more fans to the Frog
diamond. ... Vladimir Jaksic, the sharpshooting TCU hoops forward,
plans to spend the summer back home in Croatia. He says he won't be
in the war zone, but you can imagine the nervousness his decision
has caused at TCU. ...
</P>
<P>
   Former Rangers rookie Fernando Tatis is off to a terrific start
(three homers in the Cardinals' first three games) following an
ugly winter season in Puerto Rico, which included rumors that he
was spending too many late nights out on the town. ... Addendum to
last week's note on Steve Busby doing the postgame call-in show on
KRLD: Buzz is working with Kate Delaney following home games; Jack
Lazorko, who works for the Rangers, will continue to join her
following road games.
</P>
<P>
   REVO'S RIMSHOTS
</P>
<P>
   Problem with WFAA/Channel 8's Dale Hansen taping an hour-long
special at Las Colinas hotspot Cool River, as he did Thursday for
Friday night's show, is that his bar tab afterward _ he's a
generous host _ invariably blows out the station budget. Or at
least it would if Hansen didn't pony up out of his own pocket. He
won't say how high it went, but with seven bottles of Dom Perignon
on the tab and a $464 tip, you do the math.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Chipper Jones, watching Tiger Woods struggle to
hit batting practice pitching during an appearance in the Braves'
camp this spring, turned to Atlanta first baseman Ryan Klesko and
said, ``I can play golf better than he can hit.'' Maybe so,
Chipper, but more important, Tiger can play golf better than you
can hit.

BRADLEY, IN DIG AT GORE, SAYS HE THINKS BIG 
(HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley cast himself
Saturday as the candidate of big, ambitious ideas in a
not-so-subtle contrast with Vice President Al Gore, who has
recently put forward several relatively small-bore policy
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   At a convention here of the New Hampshire Democratic Party,
Bradley, thus far the only rival to Gore for the Democratic Party
presidential nomination, recited a litany of bold accomplishments
led by his party, from Social Security to the Marshall Plan to
racial integration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just the small things but the big challenges,''
Bradley declared to nearly 500 people gathered in the state that
holds the first presidential primary. ``We must remember: We've
done the big things in the past. We can do the big things in the
future.'' He added, ``The role of the President is not to shrink
from challenges but to confront challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   The convention here was the first event of the 2000 campaign
that drew large entourages from the Bradley and Gore camps,
including caravans of exuberant college students. Gore's aides said
he had a previous commitment, but his wife, Tipper, appeared in his
place.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Mrs. Gore would not talk specifically about
Bradley's comments about her husband, saying, ``probably Senator
Bradley has his own ideas, and I respect that.'' But she lauded the
vice president's proposals as touching issues that people ``feel
deeply in their daily lives.'' As the campaign progresses, Mrs.
Gore said, her husband will have more time to spell out his vision
on foreign policy, education and other matters.
</P>
<P>
   While Bradley took care not to mention Gore by name, his
advisers said the theme of big versus small ideas may emerge as a
central one of his campaign. In his speech, Bradley, a former
senator from New Jersey, touched on ambitious goals like improving
race relations, restoring trust in government and cleaning up the
way campaigns are financed.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been criticized by some Democrats, as well as by
Republicans, for following the example of President Clinton in the
1996 campaign and advancing popular but relatively narrow measures
not traditionally the province of a president, like requiring
better passenger service on airlines and taking steps to alleviate
traffic congestion.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Whouley, a senior adviser to the Gore campaign, was more
direct than Mrs. Gore in responding to Bradley. ``Senator Bill
Bradley is a very intelligent man,'' Whouley said. ``But for
someone who's short on specifics but eloquent in rhetoric, it's
interesting that he has taken shots at our specifics when he hasn't
articulated any of his own.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Gore at a news conference after the speech, Bradley
expanded upon his vision for a president with big ideas. ``The
issue is what is your focus?'' he said. ``It's not how many
positions you have on how many issues. And my focus is on big
things.'' But, noting that he had ``been on a lot of planes
lately,'' he joked that he might go along with Gore's airline
passengers' bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   In her only jab at Bradley, Mrs. Gore acknowledged ``all the
Princeton kids who are here.'' The Bradley campaign had arranged
for students from Princeton, his alma mater, and other schools to
be driven in to show their support.
</P>
<P>
   After recognizing the American soldiers involved in the conflict
in Yugoslavia, Mrs. Gore recited her husband's biography and
accomplishments. Recalling, for example, that soon after they
married, Gore went to Vietnam to be a member of the Army press
corps, Mrs. Gore said of the troops in Yugoslavia, ``I know there
is no more difficult a sacrifice to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley followed much the same pattern, mentioning Kosovo, then
delving into his background, including how he burst upon the
national scene as a star basketball player at Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore mentioned Clinton only once _ and in passing _ and
praised her husband for an economy that she said was creating
12,000 jobs a year in New Hampshire. ``If anyone,'' she said, ``my
husband understands how to keep that prosperity going.'' She
described him as ``the best vice president this country has ever
seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfazed, apparently, by the furor caused recently when Gore, in
a television interview, incorrectly credited himself with having
created the Internet, Mrs. Gore said that her husband had ``worked
hard to bring the Internet to our homes.'' Asked whether her
husband had misspoken as he himself has acknowledged to advisers,
Mrs. Gore accused the news media of misstating what he said.
``People should have been more precise in their reporting,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has a far bigger political infrastructure in this important
primary state than Bradley. In fact, a good share of the delegates
at the convention here have already signed up with the vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradley presented himself as a fresh leader who could offer
voters an alternative to eight years of Clinton and Gore. He
emphasized the importance of restoring trust in political
institutions, repairing the way campaigns are financed and pressing
for ``tolerance and racial understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said later that his comments about trust were aimed at
Clinton, not at Gore. The former senator seemed to relish his
underdog position.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Bill Russell used to say,'' he said, referring to the
former pro basketball player, ``it's easier to become No. 1 than to
stay No. 1.''

 &HT;    AFTER 3,000 MISSION, NATO AIR CAMPAIGN IS ESCALATING BUT THE
OUTCOME IS UNCERTAIN
 &HT;    EDS: Optional trim at 750.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON After nearly three weeks and more than 3,000 sorties,
the NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia has become an escalating
mission of uncertain duration and unpredictable outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Operations have swollen far beyond their original dimensions,
requiring almost daily additions of warplanes. The Pentagon said
Saturday it would add 82 more bombers, fighters and refueling
tankers to the NATO force, on top of six additional fighters
announced the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Targeting decisions have become increasingly aggressive, testing
consensus and resolve in the 19-nation NATO alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Bombing runs continue to be badly hampered by thick clouds,
pilots are in frequent risk of being shot down and military
priorities are competing with the need to feed and shelter half a
million refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The province of Kosovo lies smoldering from a Serb rampage that
has forced two out of every three ethnic Albanians to flee their
homes in the worst exodus in Europe since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Refugee flows have threatened stability in neighboring
Montenegro and Macedonia _ each faces its own internal ethnic
tensions _ and overtaxed the meager resources of Albania, the
poorest nation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   And in the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade, President Slobodan
Milosevic is as intransigent as ever, giving scant hint that the
bombing campaign has brought him any closer to the peace agreement
NATO seeks, or that he might be budged by further bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Against that background, Congress returns Monday from a two week
recess amid growing calls for President Clinton to at least develop
a contingency plan to putting troops on the ground in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very clear that there are limits to what can be
accomplished from the air,'' said Rep. Jim Turner, D-Texas, one of
11 members of Congress who visited NATO headquarters last week with
Defense Secretary William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   What began March 24 as an air campaign designed to be a
sharp-edged diplomatic tool to coerce Milosevic to accept peace, in
other words, has suddenly begun to take on the peril and
uncertainty of war.
</P>
<P>
   NATO is looking for a way to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are changing their minds as to how serious this is
going to have to be,'' said Joe Collins, senior fellow for
political-military affairs at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, a think tank in Washington. ``Clearly there
are a whole lot of people who never believed it was going to go
this far.''
</P>
<P>
   More than two weeks of bombing has taken its toll, to be sure.
</P>
<P>
   As of Saturday, the strikes had demolished about 150 bridges,
headquarters buildings, barracks, ammo dumps and other fixed
targets across Yugoslavia, as well as scores of tanks, artillery
pieces and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated attacks on fuel storage and distribution centers had
destroyed half of the petroleum stocks in the country, NATO claims.
</P>
<P>
   Serb military casualties are estimated in the hundreds _ perhaps
much higher _ and the troops are largely hunkered down in Kosovo,
nursing dwindling supplies of precious fuel, food and ammunition
and hiding out from the NATO warplanes prowling overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This air campaign is being effective,'' NATO spokesman Jamie
Shea insisted Saturday in Brussels. ``We have inflicted a hell of a
lot of damage, quite frankly, on the Yugoslav armed forces.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, officials were beginning to speculate that Serb
forces in the field could be close to a catastrophic collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fuel's running out, ammo's running out, food isn't coming in.
My morale would be pretty low at this point,'' said U.S. Army Col.
Dick Bridges, a Pentagon spokesman. ``Speaking as a soldier, you're
defenseless, your country's not doing anything, your leaders aren't
doing anything and, just from a sheer human decency standpoint, I
don't think I'd want to go on in this.''
</P>
<P>
   As the air campaign lumbered into its third week, however,
military planners were also speaking openly of an operation that
could extend well into next month. No one could predict with any
certainty when or how it might end.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two weeks after Clark asked for 24 Apache helicopters,
which fly low and fast to take on troops and tanks with
laser-guided missiles, Maj. Gen. Charles Wald said on Saturday that
it would still be another ''seven to ten days'' before the first of
those helicopters is on the ground in Albania and ready for
missions.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, said Wald, it isn't certain that the Apaches would
fight. That would require a decision from Clinton and an order from
Clark, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It could be a month before all 24 of the Apaches are ready to
fight, said Wald, vice director of strategic plans and policy for
the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, raising the prospect that the NATO
air campaign could extend well into May.
</P>
<P>
   When alliance air attacks began March 24, there was reason for
policymakers in the United States and Europe to bet that a few days
of bombing might force Milosevic to accept NATO's terms: stop
ravaging Kosovo; withdraw troops and tanks; accept a NATO-led
peacekeeping force for the province; and guarantee the safe return
of Kosovo's refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, after all, Bosnian Serbs backed by Milosevic
collapsed after less than two weeks of NATO air strikes _ a victory
aided by heavy Serb losses on the ground against Croat and Muslim
forces.
</P>
<P>
   With that goal in mind, NATO began the fight for Kosovo with a
limited mission: send a message to Milosevic by attacking radar
systems, anti-aircraft missiles and airfields, but don't venture
into the heart of Belgrade and don't try to kill Serb troops as
they massed by the thousands in and around Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, those troops dispersed throughout the province,
under orders from Milosevic to do as much shelling, torching and
terrorizing as was needed to force hordes of ethnical Albanians to
flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not getting the message,'' an exasperated Gen. Wesley
Clark, commander of the NATO campaign, told reporters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   Five days after the campaign began, Clark added 10 U.S.
warplanes to the mix, including five supersonic B-1 heavy bombers
capable of reducing an entire convoy of tanks to little more than
smoke and crumpled steel with its massive payload of armor-piercing
cluster bombs.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, though, was that the Serb tanks and troops
rampaging across Kosovo were carrying out their mayhem beneath the
cloak of thick clouds and often near population centers, sharply
restricting the effectiveness of heavy bombers as well as
low-flying attack planes.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For most of the next week, American A-10 tank killers and
British Harrier attack craft were returning to their bases without
having dropped their bombs. Either they couldn't find their targets
or they couldn't be assured of hitting them without killing
innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly haven't hit a big enough percentage of his forces
yet,'' NATO air commodore David Wilby said Friday. ``This is not an
easy operation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We started off slowly. The weather affected our operations,''
Wilby said. ``We're up against a wily enemy. He's beginning to dig
in. There are terrain, forests, deserted villages, which make
wonderful places for him to logger up against. It is quite
difficult to spot him. And, of course, once we spot him, then we've
got to bring our airplanes in to attack him quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 31, Clark asked to add the 50 strike planes and 25
support craft of the USS Roosevelt aircraft carrier, which joined
the NATO force last Tuesday. And on April 2, the Pentagon sent
Clark 13 additional F-117 stealth bombers, adding to a growing NATO
armada that by Saturday had reached some 600 warplanes and support
craft.
</P>
<P>
   The additions the Pentagon announced Saturday will bring the
NATO force to roughly 680 by early next week, and Defense
Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon said he expects other NATO
allies will send additional warplanes in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon insisted the steady growth of the mission has been part of
a systematic plan that had, from its start, been mapped out as an
escalating campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It began as it was supposed to, said Bacon, with attacks on air
defense systems, then ramped up to take on command and control
centers, like headquarters buildings, before moving to key bridges
and highways used to supply Serb forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Finally the strikes focused increasingly on troops and tanks in
the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a bit confused,'' said Wald. ``The campaign is being
unfolded just exactly as Gen. Clark planned it.''

MENIFEE WINS THE BLUE GRASS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, Ky. _ Menifee, the hometown horse named for a county
in Kentucky, thrust himself into the front ranks of candidates for
the Kentucky Derby Saturday when he ran down Cat Thief in the final
furlong and won the $750,000 Blue Grass Stakes by a length and a
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth victory in five starts for Menifee, and it
came three weeks after his only defeat, when he ran second in the
Tampa Bay Derby. And it came three weeks before the Kentucky Derby,
which will be run on May 1 at Churchill Downs in Louisville, about
75 miles west of this stately old center of thoroughbred racing
where they have been running the Blue Grass Stakes for the last 75
years.
</P>
<P>
   He gave his performance Saturday at Keeneland Race Course, a few
miles from where he was bred three years ago, the son of Harlan and
the mare Anne Campbell, and he gave one more moment of triumph to
the two men who nurtured him with great expectations: Jimmy Stone,
an oil and gas executive from New Orleans, and Arthur Hancock, the
son of the legendary Bull Hancock of Claiborne Farm.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Hancock said, with feeling, ``He's a quick learner,
and he showed how quick.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Menifee's stock was soaring Saturday, that of several
of his rivals was not. Vicar, who won the Florida Derby and the
Fountain of Youth Stakes in his last two starts, finished third.
Kimberlite Pipe, winner of the Louisiana Derby, ran fourth. Lemon
Drop Kid, fifth. Wondertross, the 9-5 favorite, ran sixth. And
Prado's Landing _ who spent the winter in Dubai on the Persian Gulf
and flew to Kentucky to test the unusual training methods of his
owner, Sheik Mohammed al Maktoum _ finished dead last.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, other 3-year-old horses were lying in ambush. On the
West Coast, the stablemates General Challenge and Prime Timber were
waiting after their one-two finish in the Santa Anita Derby. And a
new flash arose Saturday when the long shot Valhol won the Arkansas
Derby in the third start of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Day, who rode Menifee in his last four races with all the
patience of a 45-year-old Hall of Fame jockey, steered his
3-year-old prodigy through traffic and turns, and then said:
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed that he could take it on the chin and keep running.
When I took him to the outside in the homestretch, he responded
with strength. He's a nice long-striding colt, and that should be
to his advantage in three weeks when he runs in the Derby.''
</P>
<P>
   Menifee, who was not supposed to lose the Tampa Bay Derby, was
not exactly supposed to win the Blue Grass Stakes. He went off at
odds of 6-1, the fifth choice in a tightly matched field of eight
contenders for the Kentucky Derby. He won twice last summer, then
was sidelined for six months with a chip in his right knee. But
after that, he took the fast lane to the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Both of his owners credited Day for choosing Menifee when he had
other choices in the pre-Derby confusion, notably Cat Thief and
Answer Lively, last year's juvenile champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat had a choice,'' Jimmy Stone said. ``But he picked Menifee,
and stuck with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Day said, ``Once the decision was made, I had great peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Hancock, who acknowledged that ``this is one of the best days of
my life,'' remembered with emotion: ``My grandfather used to bring
me to Keeneland when I was a little boy to watch the races when
there were two buildings here.''
</P>
<P>
   Menifee prompted this tide of feeling when he nestled in fifth
place in the early running while Vicar and then Kimberlite Pipe set
the pace. Then, after three-quarters of a mile, Cat Thief took the
lead with Menifee sixth. They turned for home, and Vicar once more
nudged in front, with Menifee running fourth. Then Day made his
move to the outside, and Menifee outran Cat Thief and Vicar to the
wire.
</P>
<P>
   He ran the mile and an eighth in 1:48 3/5, finishing a length
and a quarter in front of Cat Thief, who had half a length over
Vicar. He also paid $17.40 for a $2 bet to win, and went home with
the first prize of $465,000.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott Walden, the trainer of Menifee, said: ``Unbelievable. I
am extremely excited about the way he broke, settled in and then
finished.''
</P>
<P>
   But for a genuine long shot, the colt Valhol paid $62.80 for a
$2 bet in the Arkansas Derby, ourtrunning Certain by four lengths
with Torrid Sand third, Ecton Park fourth and Answer Lively fifth.
Valhol did not even run a race until February, when he finished
second at the Fair Grounds in New Orleans. One month later, he ran
fourth in the Louisiana Derby. And one month after that, he upset
the odds completely in the Arkansas Derby at 30-1.

YANKEES AWAIT TORRE'S RETURN  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joe Torre was relaxing in a plush maroon chair behind
his desk at Yankee Stadium Saturday, just like always. There was a
pile of white lineup cards tempting him from a few inches away,
just like always. There was a calmness in his voice and a serenity
spread over his craggy face, just like always. Only it was not just
like always.
</P>
<P>
   The element missing from this typical of snapshots was Torre's
Yankee uniform, which remained in his closest. Torre is expected to
wear it during the presentation of the 1998 World Series rings
Sunday, and his slow lope onto the field should inflate the volume
at 161st Street into the decibel range of a Pearl Jam concert.
</P>
<P>
   That is the way it should be, rowdy and raucous. Torre will be
Yogi Berra Sunday. For guiding the Yankees to championships in two
of the last three seasons. For showing how to excel and actually
enjoy working under George Steinbrenner. For being another gritty
New Yorker. But, mostly, it should be boisterous to remind the
58-year-old Torre that he is not alone following prostate cancer
surgery three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans in New York are special people,'' Torre said. ``You
can walk through Manhattan, they just say, `Hi, Joe.' It's like
you're supposed to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre is supposed to be exactly where he was Saturday, even
though he watched from Steinbrenner's box while Roger Clemens made
a scintillating Stadium debut with a 5-0 triumph over the Tigers.
Torre is supposed to sign autographs, advise players and chat with
Don Zimmer, his bench coach turned interim manager, as he did.
Saturday was more than a tease since Torre discussed a possible
timetable for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when we get around May 1,'' Torre said, ``I think we'd
be getting close to a realistic time.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember, before Torre had his prostate removed on March 18, he
did not even guarantee that he would return. While General Manager
Brian Cashman said there were no formal plans for Torre's return,
another club official theorized that Torre could return on May 7
against Seattle, which is the day after the Yankees finish a 10-day
trip. Dr. William Catalona, who performed Torre's surgery, stressed
that he should not return until at least 6 to 12 weeks after the
operation. It would be seven weeks by May 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's put it this way, I hope it works out that way, or
sooner,'' Zimmer said. ``You know what I mean? He knows his own
health. If it is May 1, he'll be ready to come back. He's too smart
to do something any earlier where he might have a setback.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer sounded eager about Torre's return, and he is. The
68-year-old Zimmer indicated that he would retire from baseball
after 51 years once Torre was able to work again unless the pain
from last month's arthroscopic surgery on his right knee subsided.
``I can't go through the whole season like it is,'' Zimmer said.
``I couldn't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre must remain patient, putting his recuperation ahead of
managing the Yankees. Zimmer, who has been aiding Torre's decisions
for the last three years and who has already scored a submission
hold over Steinbrenner, can continue, then rest, maybe strengthen
his knee and return. It would be silly for Torre to come back
prematurely, and he knows it.
</P>
<P>
   Torre, who has been walking every day, continued his
rehabilitation program by working out for the first time on Friday.
He pedaled an exercise bicycle and climbed the Stairmaster. He
wants to get his body to the point where he has some energy left
after a workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor has pretty much turned me loose,'' Torre said. ``He
says whenever you think you're ready, you're the only one who knows
what your job involves.''
</P>
<P>
   This time is very precious, but it did not prevent Torre from
feeling strange when the Yankees hoisted the championship flag
without him on Friday. Even Andrea Rae, the manager's 3-year-old
daughter, could not understand why her father was watching
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sitting there and she's seeing Zim,'' Torre said. ``And
then they were talking about Yogi Berra and she was thinking in
terms of Yogi Bear. At Yogi Berra, her eyebrows went up. When they
went to a commercial, she said, `Where were you, Dad?' She couldn't
relate to me not being with the rest of the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre will be back with the Yankees for another day Sunday,
collecting a ring that honors perhaps the best team ever. Zimmer
predicted that ``people will go crazy'' for Torre and jokingly
offered to help Torre put on the pinstripes. When Zimmer was told
that Torre was uncertain about wearing the uniform, he limped
toward the manager's office and said, ``I'm going to convince him
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Expect Torre in uniform Sunday and back for good by next month.
Just like always.

 &HT;    Winkelsas latest quick-study call-up
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The newest member of the Braves is 25, was never
drafted, only mastered a slider and change-up in the past six
months and has heard his name pronounced just about every way
possible. Joe Winkelsas started last season in Class A, and stop
the Braves if you've heard this one again.
</P>
<P>
   He will join Kevin McGlinchy and Derrin Ebert as rookies making
their major-league debuts in the first week of this season. Like
McGlinchy, he came to his first spring camp as a nonroster invitee.
Winkelsas is the last step _ the Braves hope _ in the most
calamitous first week any bullpen of manager Bobby Cox's has ever
had.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a short period of time, yeah,'' Cox said. ``We're only in
our sixth ballgame and we've already made three moves.''
</P>
<P>
   This one is a statistical stretch: Winkelsas was hardly
untouchable over the spring. He allowed 16 hits and four walks in
seven appearances for a 8.38 ERA with a .356 batting average
against him.
</P>
<P>
   Winkelsas was scouted and signed in 1996 by John Stewart, the
Braves' northeast regional scouting supervisor, after the
right-hander had gone undrafted throughout his career at Elon
College. He had gotten by with an above-average fastball and
advanced to Class AA Greenville in the second half of last season,
but ranked well below Ebert, McGlinchy or even Luis Rivera among
reliever prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was throwing 95 percent fastball and I had a natural sink,''
he said before Saturday's game. ``That's all I threw. So I went up
to AA (last season), but then I went to Maryland last year for fall
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where he began work with pitching coach Dave Miller, a
minor-league pitching instructor with Cleveland who helped Miller
develop his slider and changeup. The Braves liked enough of what
they saw to bring him to the major-league camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was ridiculous,'' Winkelsas said. ``It took such a short
time. Some pitchers go half their careers and can't establish a
good change-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Springer plans
</P>
<P>
   With such inexperience, the Braves will be watching right-hander
Russ Springer's progress closely. Recovering from elbow and back
surgery, Springer will leave Monday for two or three extended
spring training appearances and then go on an injury rehab
assignment. He expects to be ready to join the Braves when they
return from a 15-day road trip at the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long year,'' Springer said. ``All the guys we got right
now, including the young guys, are capable. I'm not going to come
in and save the day, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   But his experience alone makes Springer a commodity. He has
appeared in 222 games over his seven seasons in the majors. John
Rocker, Mike Cather and the three rookies went into Saturday's game
with a combined 119 appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to know I'm going to be ready,'' said Springer, who
had bone chips removed from his elbow in October and a parts of a
herniated disc removed from his lower back in January. ``I need
some work down there. I've got to be ready to pitch in a normal
situation. I'm sure they're not going to throw me to the dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson's presence forced at least one lineup alteration,
as Ryan Klesko was benched in favor of right-handed first baseman
Brian Hunter, who made his first start in his return stint with the
Braves. Klesko went 1-for-3 against Johnson last season. . . .
Gerald Williams, who hit .366 against left-handed pitching last
year, made his second start in a row in left field in place of Otis
Nixon. . . . With his steal of third base Friday, Keith Lockhart is
halfway to his career total in two seasons with the Braves (2).

 &HT;    Olazabal holds on ahead of Norman
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ With a recovery shot at the 18th hole that would
have made his mentor proud, Spain's Jose Maria Olazabal held
together a 1-over-par 73 Saturday at Augusta National to take a
one-shot lead into today's final round of the 63rd Masters.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking his second Masters win, the 33-year-old Olazabal, a
former Seve Ballesteros pupil, fired his second shot at the 18th
from the left rough between two trees about 215 yards from the
hole, then two-putted for par, finishing at 7-under 209.
</P>
<P>
   His closest challenger is the week's biggest story _ Greg
Norman. The 44-year-old Australian stands just a stroke off the
lead after a turbulent 71 Saturday. It was three years ago that
Norman, leading by six shots after four holes, collapsed on Sunday
to lose to Nick Faldo.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Pate, who set a Masters record with seven consecutive
birdies on holes 7-13, shot a 7-under 65 and is tied for third,
with Sea Island's Davis Love III, two strokes back after an
up-and-down 70. Still in the picture, though forced to post
something low today, is Tiger Woods, who shot a 2-under 70 Saturday
and is at 2-under 214.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the way it looks, I'm right there,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   Were it not for his bizarre 12th hole, Norman would be on top of
the board. After losing his ball in a bush behind the par-3 12th,
he collected himself to make a career Masters bogey after returning
to the tee box, sinking a 30-footer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony (Navarro, his caddie) kept saying walking up there, `This
is going to be a great bogey,' '' Norman said. ``I felt so
comfortable over that putt. It had eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   After a bogey at the 13th, Norman regrouped with a two-putt
birdie at the 15th and a closing birdie, after hitting to a few
feet, at the 18th.
</P>
<P>
   Three strokes off the lead at 4 under are two U.S. Open
champions, Ernie Els (69) and Lee Janzen (73), plus Paraguay's
Carlos Franco (68) and Bob Estes (69).

 &HT;    Pate's fire drags Westwood along
 &HT;    By Michelle Hiskey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ When Steve Pate made his seventh birdie at the
par-5 13th hole, playing partner Lee Westwood waved a towel at him
to cool him off. ``I figured he'd caught fire,'' Westwood said. And
hey, doesn't Pate play for Team Tabasco, the logo on his sleeve?
</P>
<P>
   Pate probably wished Westwood would have held off, because he
parred the 14th to end his streak. Westwood, meanwhile, shot a 68
that in comparison looked like a hack job. ``I wasn't holing
anything and he was holing everything,'' said Westwood, 25, a
rising British star.
</P>
<P>
   But he admitted Pate's momentum dragged him along _ to his
lowest round in three trips here. Pate finished with a 65.
</P>
<P>
   Long way from '97
</P>
<P>
   Many players said the course played easier than it has all week
because the breeze died down and slowed the greens.
</P>
<P>
   There were so many low rounds and such a dogfight among the
leaders on the back nine that a 3-wood, 7-iron eagle by Tiger Woods
on the downwind No. 13 went virtually unnoticed. Woods, who shot 70
and stands 2 under, said afterward the changes to Augusta National
have forced him to scale back the freewheeling that gave him the
1997 title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then I was able to blow balls over the bunkers, but now
those lines have been taken away from me because of the rough,''
said Woods, one of the favorites coming into this week. Give him
the Groundhog Day award already for playing each round with Tim
Herron, one of only two players to have beaten Woods in the U.S.
Amateur. Herron shot 74 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Familiar faces
</P>
<P>
   While Davis Love III of Sea Island flirted with the lead most of
the afternoon, his fellow Georgians waited in the clubhouse.
Stewart Cink of Smyrna shot 71 and at 1 under, regretted his
two-stroke penalty in the first round. ``That's a tough way to
learn,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Mize of Columbus shot 72 to stand 2 over, as did Billy
Andrade of Atlanta (4-over). Playing in the first twosome of the
day, Georgia Tech's Matt Kuchar shot 1-over 73 that left him ``a
little disappointed,'' especially considering three back-nine
bogeys. ``I think I tried to force some shots. ... Going for
everything is a mistake here.'' Kuchar trails Tom McKnight (73_220)
by one stroke in the race for low amateur. When asked how often he
thinks about the Masters, McKnight said, ``Roughly 18 holes a
round.'' ... Spain's Sergio Garcia shot 75 and South African Trevor
Immelman 78. ``The tournament is great, the course is unbelievable
and the crowds are good,'' Garcia said. ``Everything is OK except
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Just missed
</P>
<P>
   Pate's birdie tear missed matching the low third-round score of
63. That was set in 1986 by Nick Price, who was anything but steady
Saturday. Tied for fifth after two rounds, Price had a Jekyll-Hyde
round of even par-72. He doubled the third hole and shot 40 on the
front nine, but rebounded with an eagle at No. 13 and a birdie from
the sand at No. 16, ended up with a 32 on the back. He's tied for
9th.
</P>
<P>
   Before Pate, the following players had made six birdies in a
row: Johnny Miller (1975, third round starting at No. 2), Mark
Calcavecchia (1992, fourth round, starting at No. 13), David Toms
(1998, fourth round, starting at No. 12). ... The last players to
make seven birdies at Augusta were Toms and David Duval in the
final round of the 1998 Masters. Duval shot 67 that day and tied
for second. On Saturday, Duval birdied Amen Corner (Nos. 11-13)
Saturday en route to a 70. He stands 1-under. ``I'm still there,''
he said. ``I was close to putting up a 67 or 68. I really should
have, but didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Who's hot ..
</P>
<P>
   The pride of Paraguay, Masters rookie Carlos Franco, got back on
the leaderboard with a six-birdie 68. He's tied for fifth with
Ernie Els (69_212), whose four birdies came from less than 10 feet,
including a 9-iron to No. 9 that almost fell in the cup. ``If I'm
in the tournament, it starts there tomorrow,'' said Els, pointing
to the 10th tee. ``If I'm at 4 or 5 under, you have a chance. Look
at what Steve Pate did.'' Els best finish at the Masters: tied for
ninth in '94. ... Bob Estes shot a stealth 69 to tie Els and
Franco. He was so quiet, birdieing three of his last six holes,
that the scoreboards took a while to reflect his progress. ``I
don't have the resume of the rest of the guys. You have to earn
that respect,'' he said. He's never finished higher than 27th here.
... Known as a good putter, Brad Faxon shot a 68, his best round at
the Masters, and is 1 under. His best finish here is a tie for
ninth in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ... And who's not
</P>
<P>
   A shot off the lead going into the day, Scott McCarron hit in
the azaleas on the par-3 12th hole and triple bogeyed en route to
76. After rounds of 69-68, he was the only player with a shot at
four rounds in the 60s, so that Masters milestone is safe for
another year. ... Lee Janzen, who predicted he might have some
trouble in his Saturday round, bogeyed Nos. 14 and 16 for a 73 and
is tied for fifth at 4 under. He's never shot lower than 72 in the
third round at the Masters. ... Bernhard Langer cooled off after
his second-round 66, shooting a two-birdie, two-bogey 72 to stand 2
under. ... Justin Leonard doubled twice and shot 73; he's 1 under,
tied with Bill Glasson, who had six pars in his 73. ... Brandel
Chamblee slumped to a back-nine 39 for a 75.

 &HT;    Eagles lost in 15's forest
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ For more than half a century, it was the most
benevolent, forgiving hole on the track. Its nickname,
``Firethorn,'' belied the 15th hole's status as the easiest hole at
Augusta National. Well, lookee now. Remove a few fairway mounds,
plant some pines, still tempt players to lay up or go for a green
now brown and fast, and you've got a new Masters hell hole.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask David Duval, who offered this advisory for today's
final round. ``If you have a chance, go out on that 15th fairway
and look at that green,'' said Duval, who came here a prohibitive
favorite, took a triple-bogey 8 at 15 on Friday and then
three-putted for par Saturday. ``It's not a pretty sight. Just
brown.''
</P>
<P>
   Or ask Ernie Els, who once viewed No. 15 as many players did: A
possible eagle hole, certainly a birdie possibility and no worse
than a par. ``They've got to think about that one again,'' said
Els, who's in contention at 4-under despite making three
consecutive pars at the 15th. ``They've really toughened up the tee
shot. There's no right side. We used to hit it down the right side
and go in with a 7 iron. I think guys like Tiger and David can
still go in, but us mortals....
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a really tough second shot,'' said Els. ``We used to
bargain on a four. Now, you make a five and you're kind of happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Or ask Davis Love III. Tactfully. ``It's not about just getting
it over the water any more,'' said Love, who was leading Saturday's
third round by two strokes at 7 under until he hit into the water
below the 15th hole and made double-bogey. ``No matter what club
you hit, it's over the green on 15.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this could come into play on the back nine today, and
help determine the winner of the 63rd Masters. As Els said, ``I
think 15 and 17 are the two key holes in the last stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   On 15, the problems are not just the water below but the
rock-hard green that isn't holding approaches, rather spilling them
off the back fringe. That's where Love's wedge, after he took a
drop, wound up. He was not alone. On the newly-toughened 15th,
players who've hit the green have found nearly as much treachery as
those who found the water. After Love's fourth shot hit the green
and rolled off, he chipped back up and on but two-putted for seven.
</P>
<P>
   That was one of two double-bogeys at the 15th Saturday, the
first time the hole has played below par this week. On Thursday, it
played a staggering average of 5.25 strokes. On Friday, that
improved slightly to 5.086. The field finally played the 15th below
par Saturday at an average of 4.786. Through three rounds, the hole
is playing at an average of 5.169 strokes, the 13th-hardest hole on
the course.
</P>
<P>
   All this is in sharp contrast to the hole's history. From
1942-98, the 500-yard 15th was the easiest hole on the course.
Average score per round: 4.786. The warning signs were there last
year, however, a cumulative 5.097 for the tournament. It was just
the third time No. 15 had played above par (also in 1987 and 1973).
</P>
<P>
   But much of that's changed, now that Augusta National
reconfigured the 15th. Twenty pines were added on the right side of
the fairway. Mounds that were there _ and helped sling-shot drives
down the fairway another 40-50 yards _ were removed. Mounds on the
right side of the green were also removed and six more pines
planted there. When Els played the new-look hole last October, he
didn't even recognize it. ``It's a forest on the right side.''
</P>
<P>
   And you can't see the eagles for the forest on this par-5. When
Andrew Magee holed out from 100 yards Saturday, it was just the
second eagle the 15th has yielded this week. The first came Friday
but didn't help Frank Lickliter make the cut.
</P>
<P>
   There have been four triple-bogey 8's _ most notably Duval's,
which left him feeling admittedly ``foolish'' _ and Hal Sutton's
nine on Friday. But it's the dearth of birdies that's been
damaging, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the green,'' said Duval. ``You have to hit a much more
accurate drive now. The green is very, very hard and very, very
fast.'' Which he discovered when his 25-foot eagle putt rolled
nearly 10 feet past and he missed coming back. Tiger Woods reached
in two, too, Saturday. Yet on a green he called ``shiny'' due to
too many grains, Woods struck a 25-foot up-hill putt twice as hard
as usual but still left it short.
</P>
<P>
   And Steve Pate, having just parred No. 14 after a record seven
straight birdies, hit his second shot four feet from the hole,
``Which is way too far. There's no way that ball is going anywhere
but long.'' It did. He chipped on and two-putted for par at the
now-hellish 15th.

A SMALL HORDE IS ON THE HEELS OF OLAZABAL  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga._ The leader board at the Masters is bunched as
tightly as rush-hour traffic in Manhattan, with 16 players within
five shots of the lead. Few Masters have entered the final day with
so many contenders and so many intriguing possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   From Greg Norman, a sentimental favorite, to Carlos Franco, who
has traveled from an impoverished childhood in Paraguay to the
plush fairways of Augusta National Golf Club, winning the Masters
would be a dream come true.
</P>
<P>
   Yet only one player will prevail, and considering the caliber of
names at the top, the magnitude of the event and the difficulty of
the course, the winner will have to overcome one of the greatest
challenges of his career. But then, isn't that what a major is
supposed to be about?
</P>
<P>
   Ending a bizarre third round, and setting up an unusual amount
of drama, Jose Maria Olazabal finished at seven under par (209) and
led by one stroke over Greg Norman (210) and by two strokes over
Davis Love III and Steve Pate, who were tied for third place at
five under par. Pate, who shot a 65, roared into contention by
setting a Masters record of seven consecutive birdies, starting on
No. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Els, Lee Janzen, Bob Estes and Franco were tied at four
under par. And many prominent players still believe they have a
chance. They include Steve Elkington, Nick Price and Colin
Montgomerie (all at three under par); Tiger Woods, Bernhard Langer,
Phil Mickelson and Lee Westwood (two under), and David Duval,
Justin Leonard, Jeff Sluman and the defending champion Mark O'Meara
(one under).
</P>
<P>
   There were many turning points Saturday, and once again some of
the most compelling moments involved Norman, who shot a resourceful
71, keeping his composure when trouble arose. Norman escaped
potential disaster at the par-3 12th hole when his errant tee shot
sailed over the green and into the bushes and could not be found.
After a five-minute search, he returned to the tee after a penalty
stroke, hit another shot that landed 22 feet left of the pin and
made a huge putt to salvage a bogey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a putt that I saw all the way,'' Norman said. ``I never
doubted it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not finding the ball may have been a break for Norman, who would
have faced a precarious shot from the bushes that would have made
making a bogey difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he could have made bogey from the bushes, Norman said:
``I don't know. I made 4, and that's all I'm worried about.''
</P>
<P>
   But what will be going through Norman's mind Saturday night and
Sunday? The last time he reached Sunday in contention at the
Masters, in 1996, he began the final round with a six-stroke lead
over Nick Faldo, and most people expected him to cruise to his
first Masters victory. But his game fell apart during a final-round
78, and Faldo won by five strokes.
</P>
<P>
   It was the lowest point of Norman's career, and despite winning
two British Open titles, he has longed for another chance at
Augusta. That opportunity is at hand, he has successfully returned
from last year's shoulder surgery and the gallery is clearly behind
him. It will be interesting to see how he handles another
emotionally charged final day, but he could sense people pulling
for him today as he returned to the 12th tee for his second tee
shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every person in that gallery wanted me to hit it on
the green,'' Norman said. ``I could feel the emotion coming out of
them. That was the most I've ever felt on a golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   But to win, Norman will have to overtake Olazabal, who started
the day with a two-stroke lead at eight under par, yet somehow
managed to stay in front after Saturday's 73, his worst round of
the tournament. Olazabal saved par at No. 18 with a tremendous
approach out of the rough after pulling his tee shot, but over all
he was not as sharp Saturday as he was Thursday and Friday. Yet
after severe foot pain almost forced him to find a new career in
1996, the 1994 Masters champion was thrilled to be back in the
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if I was one or two shots behind, I would be happy,''
Olazabal said. ``This is the first time I've been in this position
since my return. A one-shot lead is nothing. It's going to be a
hard day, but I'm very glad to be in this position.''
</P>
<P>
   So was Pate, who began the day 10 strokes off the lead, then
started his streak of seven consecutive birdies on No. 7. After
breaking the previous mark of six consecutive birdies, set by
Johnny Miller (1975), Mark Calcavecchia (1992) and David Toms
(1998), Pate was confident, although he has never won a major.
</P>
<P>
   However, no matter what happens Sunday, much of the attention
will be focused on Norman, who will be in the final group with
Olazabal. Once again, his career and life will be altered by
another Sunday at Augusta. This time, he is hoping for a happier
ending, and he vowed not to let demons from the past re-enter his
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said I don't live in the past,'' Norman said.
``What's done is done. I don't reflect on negative situations. Some
people like to write about them and talk about them, but that's
their prerogative. I don't let that get in my head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've become a little more at peace and at ease with myself.
But don't get me wrong. Tomorrow, I'm going to play to win. That's
what I'm here for.''

FOOTBALL-STADIUM _ Voters in Mesa, Gilbert and Queen Creek will go

HOCKEY-ARENA _ It appeared at first that opponents of a Phoenix

campaign by selling 75-cent cookies and $4 yard-sale dresses. With
just weeks left before a crucial May 18 vote on the hockey arena

 &HT;    AFTER 3,000 MISSION, NATO AIR CAMPAIGN IS ESCALATING BUT THE
OUTCOME IS UNCERTAIN
 &HT;    NOTE: Adds first reference to Gen Clark in 21st graf 
 &HT;    EDS: Optional trim at 750.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON After nearly three weeks and more than 3,000 sorties,
the NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia has become an escalating
mission of uncertain duration and unpredictable outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Operations have swollen far beyond their original dimensions,
requiring almost daily additions of warplanes. The Pentagon said
Saturday it would add 82 more bombers, fighters and refueling
tankers to the NATO force, on top of six additional fighters
announced the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Targeting decisions have become increasingly aggressive, testing
consensus and resolve in the 19-nation NATO alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Bombing runs continue to be badly hampered by thick clouds,
pilots are in frequent risk of being shot down and military
priorities are competing with the need to feed and shelter half a
million refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The province of Kosovo lies smoldering from a Serb rampage that
has forced two out of every three ethnic Albanians to flee their
homes in the worst exodus in Europe since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Refugee flows have threatened stability in neighboring
Montenegro and Macedonia _ each faces its own internal ethnic
tensions _ and overtaxed the meager resources of Albania, the
poorest nation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   And in the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade, President Slobodan
Milosevic is as intransigent as ever, giving scant hint that the
bombing campaign has brought him any closer to the peace agreement
NATO seeks, or that he might be budged by further bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Against that background, Congress returns Monday from a two week
recess amid growing calls for President Clinton to at least develop
a contingency plan to putting troops on the ground in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very clear that there are limits to what can be
accomplished from the air,'' said Rep. Jim Turner, D-Texas, one of
11 members of Congress who visited NATO headquarters last week with
Defense Secretary William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   What began March 24 as an air campaign designed to be a
sharp-edged diplomatic tool to coerce Milosevic to accept peace, in
other words, has suddenly begun to take on the peril and
uncertainty of war.
</P>
<P>
   NATO is looking for a way to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are changing their minds as to how serious this is
going to have to be,'' said Joe Collins, senior fellow for
political-military affairs at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, a think tank in Washington. ``Clearly there
are a whole lot of people who never believed it was going to go
this far.''
</P>
<P>
   More than two weeks of bombing has taken its toll, to be sure.
</P>
<P>
   As of Saturday, the strikes had demolished about 150 bridges,
headquarters buildings, barracks, ammo dumps and other fixed
targets across Yugoslavia, as well as scores of tanks, artillery
pieces and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated attacks on fuel storage and distribution centers had
destroyed half of the petroleum stocks in the country, NATO claims.
</P>
<P>
   Serb military casualties are estimated in the hundreds _ perhaps
much higher _ and the troops are largely hunkered down in Kosovo,
nursing dwindling supplies of precious fuel, food and ammunition
and hiding out from the NATO warplanes prowling overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This air campaign is being effective,'' NATO spokesman Jamie
Shea insisted Saturday in Brussels. ``We have inflicted a hell of a
lot of damage, quite frankly, on the Yugoslav armed forces.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, officials were beginning to speculate that Serb
forces in the field could be close to a catastrophic collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fuel's running out, ammo's running out, food isn't coming in.
My morale would be pretty low at this point,'' said U.S. Army Col.
Dick Bridges, a Pentagon spokesman. ``Speaking as a soldier, you're
defenseless, your country's not doing anything, your leaders aren't
doing anything and, just from a sheer human decency standpoint, I
don't think I'd want to go on in this.''
</P>
<P>
   As the air campaign lumbered into its third week, however,
military planners were also speaking openly of an operation that
could extend well into next month. No one could predict with any
certainty when or how it might end.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two weeks after Gen. Wesley Clark, commander of the NATO
campaign, asked for 24 Apache helicopters, which fly low and fast
to take on troops and tanks with laser-guided missiles, Maj. Gen.
Charles Wald said on Saturday that it would still be another
''seven to ten days'' before the first of those helicopters is on
the ground in Albania and ready for missions.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, said Wald, it isn't certain that the Apaches would
fight. That would require a decision from Clinton and an order from
Clark, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It could be a month before all 24 of the Apaches are ready to
fight, said Wald, vice director of strategic plans and policy for
the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, raising the prospect that the NATO
air campaign could extend well into May.
</P>
<P>
   When alliance air attacks began March 24, there was reason for
policymakers in the United States and Europe to bet that a few days
of bombing might force Milosevic to accept NATO's terms: stop
ravaging Kosovo; withdraw troops and tanks; accept a NATO-led
peacekeeping force for the province; and guarantee the safe return
of Kosovo's refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, after all, Bosnian Serbs backed by Milosevic
collapsed after less than two weeks of NATO air strikes _ a victory
aided by heavy Serb losses on the ground against Croat and Muslim
forces.
</P>
<P>
   With that goal in mind, NATO began the fight for Kosovo with a
limited mission: send a message to Milosevic by attacking radar
systems, anti-aircraft missiles and airfields, but don't venture
into the heart of Belgrade and don't try to kill Serb troops as
they massed by the thousands in and around Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, those troops dispersed throughout the province,
under orders from Milosevic to do as much shelling, torching and
terrorizing as was needed to force hordes of ethnical Albanians to
flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not getting the message,'' an exasperated Clark told
reporters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   Five days after the campaign began, Clark added 10 U.S.
warplanes to the mix, including five supersonic B-1 heavy bombers
capable of reducing an entire convoy of tanks to little more than
smoke and crumpled steel with its massive payload of armor-piercing
cluster bombs.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, though, was that the Serb tanks and troops
rampaging across Kosovo were carrying out their mayhem beneath the
cloak of thick clouds and often near population centers, sharply
restricting the effectiveness of heavy bombers as well as
low-flying attack planes.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For most of the next week, American A-10 tank killers and
British Harrier attack craft were returning to their bases without
having dropped their bombs. Either they couldn't find their targets
or they couldn't be assured of hitting them without killing
innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly haven't hit a big enough percentage of his forces
yet,'' NATO air commodore David Wilby said Friday. ``This is not an
easy operation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We started off slowly. The weather affected our operations,''
Wilby said. ``We're up against a wily enemy. He's beginning to dig
in. There are terrain, forests, deserted villages, which make
wonderful places for him to logger up against. It is quite
difficult to spot him. And, of course, once we spot him, then we've
got to bring our airplanes in to attack him quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 31, Clark asked to add the 50 strike planes and 25
support craft of the USS Roosevelt aircraft carrier, which joined
the NATO force last Tuesday. And on April 2, the Pentagon sent
Clark 13 additional F-117 stealth bombers, adding to a growing NATO
armada that by Saturday had reached some 600 warplanes and support
craft.
</P>
<P>
   The additions the Pentagon announced Saturday will bring the
NATO force to roughly 680 by early next week, and Defense
Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon said he expects other NATO
allies will send additional warplanes in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon insisted the steady growth of the mission has been part of
a systematic plan that had, from its start, been mapped out as an
escalating campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It began as it was supposed to, said Bacon, with attacks on air
defense systems, then ramped up to take on command and control
centers, like headquarters buildings, before moving to key bridges
and highways used to supply Serb forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Finally the strikes focused increasingly on troops and tanks in
the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a bit confused,'' said Wald. ``The campaign is being
unfolded just exactly as Gen. Clark planned it.''

IT'S DALY'S MAGIC TRICK 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It isn't quite deja vu, but Orlando Magic coach Chuck
Daly has noticed the similarities. A dozen years ago, his Detroit
Pistons went from being conference fodder to the conference finals,
thanks in part to two rookies: Dennis Rodman and John Salley.
</P>
<P>
   Daly played them and played them down the stretch, much to the
chagrin of some veterans. The rookies played with enthusiasm, and
neither needed the ball to be effective. It was a combination that
would help yield three straight trips to the NBA Finals and two
titles for the Pistons.
</P>
<P>
   Flash forward to the Magic. Last year they didn't even make the
playoffs. Shortly after the season ended, the Magic brass met and
Daly made one request.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had remembered what we did in Detroit, where we got really
lucky with that one draft (1986),'' Daly said. ``I said to (general
manager) John Gabriel, `We need to do the same thing here we did
there. We need to build a roster.' I needed to find people that I
could put into the game.''
</P>
<P>
   He has found them in Michael Doleac and Matt Harpring. They play
every game. They play down the stretch. Harpring is even starting
with the injury to Bo Outlaw. They have played big roles in
Orlando's surprising rise back to the top of the Eastern
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic had three first-round picks last June. They took
Doleac, a no-brainer because they wanted size, at No. 12. At No.
13, they took Keon Clark, then traded him to Denver. At No. 15, the
Magic snared Harpring, over whom Daly had salivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``My office at our practice complex looks out over the floor,''
Daly said, ``and when we brought this kid in for a workout, I saw
him for three minutes and said, `I want that kid.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Daly recalled a conversation he had early in the 1986-87 season
with Billy Cunningham, then a television analyst. He said
Cunningham watched the Pistons and told Daly that the team, because
of the rookies, had moved up the ladder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't understand what he meant,'' Daly said. ``I just
didn't think two guys could be that important, especially guys who
didn't need the ball. But he was right. They were. And we did move
up the ladder.''
</P>
<P>
   Doleac and Harpring are much different players from Rodman and
Salley. But they also bear testament to Daly's willingness to do
what has to be done, even if it seems unconventional or unorthodox.
The success of the rookies is even more remarkable given that Daly
basically has eliminated practices, another unusual decision.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, thanks in part to the rooks, the Magic really have
moved up the ladder.
</P>
<P>
   ``They still don't know a lot about the league or other
players,'' Daly said. ``But they're great kids and they've made a
difference on our team. We got lucky. We were able to draft them
and I've been able to play them.''
</P>
<P>
   They're also a little different off the floor as well. When the
team took a red-eye home following its Saturday night game in
Oakland March 13, Daly headed for Mass that Sunday morning. He he
saw the two rookies in the church _ still in their sweatsuits.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Kenny Anderson situation is going to be interesting to watch
over the summer. First, Anderson's remaining four years ($31
million) will, as of July 1, start to come out of Paul Gaston's
wallet. Should the Celtics be inclined to discuss alternatives,
don't be surprised if they do so with the Clippers. First, Los
Angeles desperately needs a point guard. Anderson is a name _
always a big thing for Donald Sterling _ and this time, under the
rules, he'd have to report if traded. The Clippers are well under
the cap and could afford him, especially if they re-signed one of
their own free agents and then traded him to Boston. While Pitino
is interested in Rodney Rogers, a better guy would be Lorenzen
Wright. He would help out on the front line and he's a talent, not
to mention a banger. Would the Clippers be dumb enough to do that?
Well, they're the Clippers. And they'd be getting something for an
asset. Plus, they have enough frontcourt players. The downside for
Boston would be finding a replacement for Anderson. Pitino might be
able to live with Dana Barros for the time being. You can bet the
house that Wayne Turner will be in Boston's camp unless someone
drafts him. He can do everything but shoot . . . The Celtics also
will have their $2 million ``middle class'' exception to offer to
free agents. But here's another twist: How many veterans around the
league are going to want to play Pitino Ball? The coach wants
veterans, needs veterans, but the word is out on the street, even
moreso after L'Affaire Anderson. ``Rick is going to need some
veterans on that team,'' observed Toronto's Charles Oakley,
mentioned as a potential Boston target but more likely to stay
where he is. ``He's got a young team and has to get some veterans.
You get veterans, you might change the style or the offense, you
never know. Get a big guy, more veterans, maybe you play more
man-to-man. Get some big guys inside and that makes a coach's job
easier. He's got a small team now. It's hard. You need big bodies
in the East. I don't care how many All-Stars you have or how much
you pay a guy. Money ain't the thing anymore. Everyone's got it.''
. . . The Celtics are on board, but not in the forefront, of next
month's Bill Russell ceremony at the FleetCenter. Normally, the
team is quick to embrace, promote, and market one of its many
legends, of which Russell is among the top. The idea started as a
way to raise funds for the National Mentoring Partnership, which is
similar to Big Brother/Big Sister. Russell sits on the
partnership's board and is active in the program. One of the ideas
apparently was to have the fund-raiser coincide with Russell's 65th
birthday, which was in February. Now it's the 30th anniversary of
his last title and retirement. There are a lot of big names who've
signed on, and the Celtics will be represented by Red Auerbach and
Pitino. But the event is being handled by Russell and his reps and
being promoted by a Boston public relations firm.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A couple of new names have popped into some draftniks' potential
lottery lists. One is Jumaine Jones of Georgia, a 6-foot-7-inch
skywalking sophomore who had some Bulldog fans thinking of
Dominique Wilkins. The other is 7-3 Alexander Radojevic, a 7-3,
235-pound juco lad who has signed with Ohio State. But there was a
lot of talk at the Portsmouth tournament that he might decide to
just turn pro. Radojevic played last season for Barton County
Community College in Kansas . . . Dave Cowens's name has surfaced
in the search to replace Jim Harrick at Rhode Island, along with
the names of college guys (Mike Deane, ex- of Marquette). But
here's another name that has surfaced: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The Big
Fella is eager to get into coaching . . . Daly was selected as one
of the all-time Top 10 coaches a couple years ago when the NBA
celebrated its 50th anniversary. But he and Jack Ramsay are the
only two contemporary coaches on the list never to have won a Coach
of the Year Award. Given the Magic's season, the Prince of
Pessimism has to be the front-runner, although, predictably, he's
loath even to discuss the matter. ``You know with this season, you
can go from first to eighth with a few losses in a week,'' he said.
Yeah, yeah, Chuck. But how would it feel? ``I'd be in shock,'' he
said. ``I don't concern myself with that stuff. The one other time
I was considered in '84, they gave it to Frank Layden. I'm just a
second banana, that's all.'' . . . The NBA has quietly welcomed
back referee Ron Olesiak, who settled his differences with the
Internal Revenue Service. The only remaining ref still not working
because of IRS problems is Blane Reichelt. He may fight the charges
in court . . . The Bulls are back in town  &UR; tonight &LR;  (wonder if
Antoine Walker will give Ron Harper the choke hold?) and you may
not even know or care. Chicago had a slew of free agents last
summer and only one re-signed, Bill Wennington. We asked him about
the difference traveling this year and in the past three. ``The
masses aren't there anymore,'' he said. ``You'd get to some places
and there'd be 500 people waiting for the bus. Now, it's more like
10 kids. It was surreal in the past three years and now it's back
to normal. For those of us who've been on other teams, and know
what it's really like, we go, `Oh yeah, that's what it's like.' I
remember when Jason Caffey was a rookie. He said to me, `Billy, is
it always like this?' I said, `Jason, it's never like this.' The
past three years is something that will never happen again for us.
It was just unbelievable.'''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It took a while, but the Spurs finally may have gotten their
very powerful act together. ``There's no real secret,'' says
coach/general manager Gregg Popovich. ``We've gotten better and so
has the schedule.'' The Spurs started out poorly and were 6-8 at
one point, two losses coming to the Lakers. But then they hit a
wondrous stretch littered with Denvers, Vancouvers, and Dallases
and went on a tear. They're through with that now, but showed
they're back with a big win at Houston Thursday night. Tim Duncan
is rounding into form, but David Robinson's numbers are down and
Popovich thinks he knows why. First, Robinson is in constant pain
(a la Patrick Ewing) with back and knee woes, and will be until he
retires. ``David's problem is that he has a ridiculous tolerance
for pain and he doesn't want to disappoint anyone in the world,''
said Popovich. ``He'll tell you, `I'm fine, I'm fine,' but you know
it is bothering him. He just presses on.'' Also, Robinson is
learning to play a different way. ``It's a transition in his
career,'' Popovich said. ``He's learning how to score in different
ways, other than just by sheer athleticism. He's got to play
smarter now. He can't do it by just being quicker or faster. His
game is going to change and he's going through it.'' Popovich is
pleased with the additions of Steve Kerr, Mario Elie, and Jerome
Kersey, saying they've added toughness and experience to the team.
``We played Utah tough last year in the playoffs, but we had no
perimeter game,'' he said. ``Now, we do.'' The Spurs will try to
re-sign Duncan this summer, but here's the pickle they're in. They
can't stay in the Alamodome, and the last chance to get a new arena
will come in a referendum either in November or January. What if
Duncan re-signs (he likes San Antonio, according to Popovich) and
the Spurs have to move? He might choose to wait until the summer of
2000, when he's a free agent, before re-signing. Or signing
elsewhere if the Spurs have to move. The referendum will be the
final say. If that doesn't pass, the Spurs are gone.

IF THEY COULD DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN...

<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a lot of scouting being done right now in out-of-the-way
places like Portsmouth, Va., by NBA teams trying to figure out who
they should draft this summer. But for all the work and man hours
spent by every pro organization (and the Clippers), a lot of teams
still look silly after last year's choices.
</P>
<P>
   Let's look at the top 10 players in the 1998 draft and see how
different it would turn out if teams could re-pick today.
</P>
<P>
   1. Clippers, Michael Olowokandi: Does anyone even care what they
do? Unfortunately, it's already clear the player of the '98 draft
is Toronto's Vince Carter, who could start at shooting guard or
small forward. New pick: Vince Carter
</P>
<P>
   2. Vancouver, Mike Bibby: Stu Jackson might want Olowokandi, but
Bibby's averaging 14 points and seven assists in 36 minutes. New
pick: Bibby
</P>
<P>
   3. Denver, Raef LaFrentz: Before he got hurt, LaFrentz was
outstanding. But the Nuggets can't pass on Olowokandi.
</P>
<P>
   New pick: Olowokandi.
</P>
<P>
   4. Toronto, Antawn Jamison: They're enjoying Carter today by way
of trade. If the Clippers had done their job, Toronto would have
had to find the second-best small forward.
</P>
<P>
   New pick: Paul Pierce
</P>
<P>
   5. Golden State, Vince Carter: What were the Warriors thinking
last June? Thanks, P.J. New pick: LaFrentz
</P>
<P>
   6. Dallas, Robert Traylor: What makes Don Nelson look dumber?
Picking Traylor or trading him for Dirk Nowitzki? And then they
still needed to obtain disappointing point guard Steve Nash. New
pick: Jason Williams
</P>
<P>
   7. Sacramento, Jason Williams: Hey, a team that did its
homework. If Nellie hadn't blown it, the Kings would have had to
improvise.
</P>
<P>
   They could go the best-player-available route, and everyone's
kicking themselves today for missing out on Georgia Tech's Matt
Harpring, who can guard small forwards or shooting guards and who
went to Orlando at 15. New pick: Matt Harpring
</P>
<P>
   8. Philadelphia, Larry Hughes: Eric Snow has been starting at
the point and the Sixers really need a forward. New pick: Michael
Doleac.
</P>
<P>
   9. Milwaukee, Dirk Nowitzki: Luckily, they dumped this German
import to Dallas. They need a backup point guard.
</P>
<P>
   New pick! Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   10. Boston, Paul Pierce: The Celtics got lucky, but Pierce
wouldn't last this long today. They still want a forward,
especially one who will politely listen to Rick Pitino's nonsense.
New pick: Jamison.
</P>
<P>
   __ Solid as Oak: Toronto's resurgence is directly related to the
addition of forward Charles Oakley. So the Raptors, who initially
offered the potential free agent a three-year deal worth $12
million, have upped the ante. Not its about $20 million over three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley was insulted by the first offer. ``What they offered me,
I think was embarrassing,'' Oakley said. ``If that's what they're
going to be offering me, I won't be staying. I would rather go
somewhere else for less. Hey, I'm having a good time. I don't want
the max.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammate Dee Brown believes the Raptors should re-sign Oakley at
any price.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no more Oaks around,'' Brown said. ``There's (Dennis)
Rodman, but he's crazy. There's Jason Williams, but he's hurt. Who
else will dive for the loose ball, get a rebound, make a good pass,
give you tough defense, flagrant-foul a guy _ you can't teach
that.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Slap the other cheek: Warriors forward Terry Cummings has
been a Pentecostal minister for more than 20 years but ranks third
in the league with eight technical fouls and also has been called
for two flagrant fouls.
</P>
<P>
   Despite losing more than $32,000 in salary for the technicals,
Cummings is not repentant, claiming the Warriors receive no respect
from referees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going out of my way to get them,'' he said of the
technicals. ``I'm just trying to make a point. If I can get
technicals the way I'm getting them after all these years, somebody
may try to figure out what's wrong with Cummings or what's wrong
with the game.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Peeler done? Former Lakers guard Anthony Peeler, who strained
his left calf March 15 against Utah, saw a specialist in Boston
this week and might not return to the Minnesota lineup this season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Fond farewell: Not every player is trashing the Sports Arena.
Phoenix's Danny Manning, a former Clipper, was asked what he'll
remember most about the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``The maintenance crew,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Manning recalled long, lonely nights when he would travel to the
arena and stay there for hours as he worked to rehabilitate his
knee. He lifted weights and shot as the crew worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes until as late as 11 p.m.,'' Manning said. ``Hey, I
spent a lot of time with those guys. Sometimes, they'd leave the
lights on and the door unlocked for me.'' &QL;

BRUINS A TEAM WITH SUBSTANCE 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ That 3-0 hiccup Thursday night in Tampa aside, the
Bruins are finishing up the regular season with confidence. Before
their loss to the Lightning, they were 14-4-4, a run that left
Florida, Montreal, and the Rangers in the breeze and allowed Boston
some breathing room in the last week before the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Do you like what you see? You should.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the elements of success are obvious: The coaching of Pat
Burns, the netminding of Byron Dafoe, the metronomic dependability
of Ray Bourque, and a teamwide attention to defense that is
personified by the checking line of Rob DiMaio, Tim Taylor, and
P.J. Axelsson.
</P>
<P>
   Headed into Saturday's FleetCenter matinee against the Bolts,
the Bruins had lost only two of their last 12 games. They may not
be the most exciting entry in the Original 27 _ OK, so defense
isn't as sensational as, say, a Paul Kariya end-to-ender _ but
they're a reliable, respectable product headed into the postseason.
It's by no means a stretch to believe they could make it to the Cup
finals (insert the standard injury and bizarre officiating
disclaimers here).
</P>
<P>
   Two winning elements that haven't been accentuated enough in the
second half: the play of Kyle McLaren and the emergence of Joe
Thornton.
</P>
<P>
   McLaren, without question, is now the key to the blue line
corps. This is one case where the numbers do back up the theory.
When McLaren remained out in a contract squabble at the start of
the season, the Bruins went 6-6-3. When he banged up his shoulder
in Buffalo Jan. 15 and had to miss a month, they were a moribund
3-9-3. Headed into Saturday's action, the Bruins were 27-14-7
(.635) with McLaren in the lineup, 9-15-6 (.400) without him.
</P>
<P>
   Is McLaren a Norris Trophy candidate? Hardly. He doesn't have
the mobility, agility or the points to be considered in that group.
In fact, he often looks awkward back there; remember, he is still
only 21, probably a year or two away from being a finished
physiological product.
</P>
<P>
   But the impact of his presence behind the Boston blue line is
indisputable. When he is one of the six in the backline rotation,
it's a far more formidable, complete, effective group. Their
strengths are different, but take either McLaren or Bourque out of
the defense, and the whole mosaic begins to fall apart rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton's progress has been more ballyhooed, of course, but
it's worth underscoring again. With his every inch of progress, the
entire Boston offensive plan moves ahead in lockstep. If he keeps
getting better _ and he is savvy enough and skilled enough to make
that a virtual guarantee _ then the Bruins finally can solidify a
two-line attack.
</P>
<P>
   This much we have learned here in the hockey Hub in the '90s: A
one-line attack is a guaranteed first-round knockout in the
playoffs. A two-line attack doesn't make a trip to the finals a
fait accompli, but it is the pedigree needed to get there. Without
it, the postseason is only a matter of four, five, six, or seven
more games.
</P>
<P>
   The key elements are here. Depth is now the concern, an issue
that was evident after last season, too. They've got the coach
(with appropriate game plan), the goaltender, the defense, and the
ever-improving attack. What they lack, as we speak, are the four or
five depth players who can fill in and flourish when fatigue and
injury begin to chew away at the core players during an eight-week
playoff haul.
</P>
<P>
   Those role players did not show up from Providence. They didn't
arrive via trade or free agency. Can the Bruins win without them?
Yes. But it means everyone staying healthy, and everyone continuing
to play at _ or beyond _ expectation at the most difficult time of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Calgary defenseman Steve Smith might make it back to the lineup
Monday night (vs. Vancouver) after suffering a frightening gash to
the neck last weekend when he upended Toronto forward Lladislav
Kohn. One of Kohn's skates opened up a 4-inch wound, nearly 2
inches deep, leaving Smith with nerve damage that doctors say could
take up to a year to heal. Locked up in a fight with Edmonton for
the final playoff spot in the West, the Flames have severely missed
Smith's steadying influence behind the blue line. The ugly incident
was reminiscent of the near-fatal gash that Clint Malarchuk
suffered while tending net for the Sabres at the start of the '90s
. . . The Penguins, in a freefall the last couple of weeks, should
have both Jaromir Jagr and Tom Barrasso back for Sunday's game in
Detroit. Jagr has been down only a week with a groin injury.
Barrasso, ex- of Acton-Boxboro HS, has been out since breaking a
small bone in his hand March 3. And it will warm the heart of every
Bruins fan to know that Ulf Samuelsson could be making his Red
Wings debut Sunday. Samuelsson fractured an ankle only days before
the Rangers dealt him to Hockeytown at the March 23 trade deadline
. . . The read here on the Eastern Conference: Any one of the eight
teams could make it to the Cup finals, and that especially includes
the local entry. Read No. 2: Whoever makes it to the final will
have about the same shot the Bruins had in '88 and '90, when they
managed to win only one of nine games vs. the mighty Oilers . . .
Showing a slight pulse after playing barely a shade over comatose
all season, the Blackhawks removed the ``interim'' tag from Lorne
Molleken Thursday and made him the head coach, with what is
believed to be a three-year deal worth some $400,000 per season.
Entering the weekend, the non-playoff-bound Hawks were 11-6-4 since
the 42-year-old Molleken took over for Dirk Graham, the ex-Hawk who
only last summer hired him as his assistant. OK, 11-6-4 doesn't
sound like much, but that pace over an 82-game season projects to
upwards of 100 points _ a level the Hawks have reached only three
times in the last 25 years . . . If not for his roommate, Keith
Jones, virtually dragging him out of the team hotel, Eric Lindros
might have not made it to the Nashville hospital where doctors
reinflated his collapsed lung last weekend. His followup surgery
Thursday in Philadelphia to remove a hardened blood clot below the
lung went smoothly, but no one realistically expects L'Enfant
Terrible to be back in the Flyer lineup before next fall. Doctors
say it will take at least a month for him to regenerate the great
amount of blood he lost _ about half his body's supply _ and he
thus far has refused transfusions.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It appears increasingly obvious around Los Angeles that Larry
Robinson won't be back to coach the Kings, who will be out of the
playoffs for the third time in four years under his watch. Good
coach, Robinson, but the Kings have been in a personnel crisis ever
since he arrived _ in part the result of trades such as Dafoe and
Dmitri Khristich for Jozef Stumpel and Sandy Moger. Ouchmagoucha.
One of their few good swaps was getting Luc Robitaille back in
return for Kevin Stevens, but there also was the
multimillion-dollar Steve Duchesne faux pas. If Robinson walks and
the Kings overhaul the coach department, three good assistants
could be cut loose: Don Edwards, Rick Green, and Jay Leach . . . At
a time when the trend is to build sparkling practice facilities _
an industrywide attempt to coddle the players and, more important,
better market the product _ the Bruins continue to hide their
practices behind locked doors in Wilmington. The folks at the
Ristuccia Center run a clean, efficient operation, and most players
live only a short commute to the rink. It's a nice fit. But as the
'90s draw to a close, and ticket prices skyrocket, there are more
and more fans who never will be able to afford a seat in the
FleetCenter. If they can't at least go to a practice and experience
the sight and sounds of the game, and their only connection is the
televised product (a subject for another day), then eventually that
segment of the fan base will disappear. A new facility with a
couple of rinks, festooned with team merchandise and a box office
for Vault events would go a long way toward enhancing the team
profile . . . On the subject of ticket sales, you know times are
changing when 1,000 seats go unsold in Montreal and scalpers are
seen dumping them for half-price. It happened Wednesday when the
Hurricanes were in town . . . Ex-Canadien Vincent Damphousse has
reconnected with his scoring touch now that he's in San Jose. He
hit for the hat trick last Saturday against Vancouver, bringing
down a flurry of hats and, in true Silicon Valley fashion, a hail
of software disks. HearMe.com, a local on-line venture that allows
chatters to actually talk on-line, blanketed the house with the
free disks. In Detroit you get octopus. In Miami you get rats. And
in San Jose . . .
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Canadiens, for giving up Damphousse, will get a fifth-round
pick this season and at least a second-rounder in the 2000 draft.
It could become a first-rounder if: Damphousse plays in 90 percent
of the Sharks' games this season, including the playoffs; he
averages at least a point per game; the Sharks make it to the
second round of the postseason. And if Damphousse signs in San Jose
as a free agent this summer, the Habs could end up with a first-
and second-round pick in 2000 . . . Ex-Bruin Joe Juneau came down
with the flu soon after his trade to Buffalo and entered weekend
play with only one goal since departing Washington. Don't look for
the Sabres to try to sign him as a free agent. He has the Canadiens
and Senators at the top of his wish list . . . Entering weekend
play, the Hurricanes were a grim 0-5-5 in their last 10 road games.
Listen carefully, and you almost can hear the Forever .500 fight
song, ``Brass Bonanza.'' New city. Same Whale . . . In case you
missed it, the Flames late last month picked up Robyn Regehr as
part of the compensation for sending Theo Fleury to the Avalanche.
Colorado, using the pick it acquired from Boston in the Landon
Wilson-Anders Myrvold exchange, made Regehr the 19th pick overall
in the '98 draft. The Flames could use the 6-foot-2-inch, 210-pound
Regehr now, but he must remain in junior (Kamloops) until his
club's season comes to an end . . . Still no new deal for Brian
Sutter in Calgary . . . Cup or no Cup, look for the Avalanche to be
sold this summer, before the opening of their new Pepsi Center.
Ascent Entertainment is expected to unload the Avalanche, Nuggets,
and new arena to former Memphis State guard Bill Laurie, whose net
worth is reported as just shy of $1 billion (he married Nancy
Walton, heir to the Wal-Mart fortune). Meanwhile, it's biz as usual
in Denver. The Avalanche last week signed Alex Tanguay, their top
pick (No. 12 overall) last June, to a three-year deal worth $2.925
million and assigned him to Hershey (AHL). Tanguay is a slick
passer and proficient scorer (he popped in five goals in training
camp before being returned to junior) and has a decent chance of
sticking next season _ depending how the change in ownership
influences the financial makeup of the roster . . . The Red Wings
since their deadline wheeling and dealing: eight straight wins and
a tie, outscoring the opposition, 31-12. It's a possibility that
the Wings will move Brendan Shanahan (hello, Hurricanes? Rangers?
Flyers? Devils?) over the summer, in part to recoup the two
first-round draft picks they sent to Chicago in the Chris Chelios
swap. Shanahan next season will make $4 million (the end of a
four-year, $15.2 million pact) before becoming a free agent July 1,
2000 . . . If you're wondering what happened to ex-Bruin Garry
Galley on the LA depth chart, he recently exited the lineup with an
abdominal strain, won't be back this last week of the season, and
may require offseason surgery . . . The Devils will honor Peter
Stastny before their game at Exit 16W against the Islanders Monday.
Stastny, the only Devil to be inducted into the Hockey Hall of
Fame, now lives in suburban St. Louis and is a special-assignment
scout for the Blues . . . The Minnesota Wild, ready to debut in
October 2000, are about to begin interviews for prospective GMs.
Some of the names believed to be on the punch list: Les Jackson,
Pierre Page, Herb Brooks, David McNab, Paul Holmgren, Ray Shero,
and Bobby Smith. The St. Paul-based club doesn't have its broadcast
plan in place yet, but no fewer than 150 resume tapes already have
found their way to Wild HQ. If only the league's ice surfaces were
as competitive as the broadcast booth . . . If you want to make it
inside the Vault for the NHL's June 26 amateur draft, admission is
free (note: This is not a cruel hoax! It's a freebie). The general
admission ducats can be picked up only at the FleetCenter box
office beginning May 7. Season ticket-holders will receive their
tickets via mail at the start of May. Before the trooping of the
teen-agers, Bourque will be honored on the 20th anniversary of his
draft day.

BROWNS SHOULD SIT ON COUCH IN NO. 1 SPOT 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Tom Condon is used to what he's been hearing
the last few weeks about his No. 1 client, Kentucky quarterback Tim
Couch. But he's not used to hearing what's being said about
himself.
</P>
<P>
   The former Boston College and NFL offensive lineman who now runs
IMG's football department is used to hearing that the top-rated guy
in December has more holes in his resume than Tim Johnson by April.
He heard it a year ago as scouts tried to poke holes in Peyton
Manning before the Colts made Manning the draft's No. 1 pick. Now
he's hearing it about Couch, who was the consensus No. 1 pick when
the college football season ended but now is said by some (although
not many NFL personnel directors) to be in a dead heat with Oregon
quarterback Akili Smith and Heisman Trophy-winning running back
Ricky Williams for the draft's premier position.
</P>
<P>
   But what Condon is not used to, nor terribly happy about, are
attacks from his business rivals about how he supposedly stole
Couch from rival agent Steve Wichard by reducing his company's fee
to $50,000 (according to ESPN Magazine) or zero (according to the
Atlanta Constitution) while guaranteeing Couch $3 million in
endorsement income.
</P>
<P>
   According to two people who should know _ Condon and Couch _
IMG's management fee has remained a standard 3 percent, the same 3
percent it was for Manning, even though it was whispered that
Condon had lowballed the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Condon intends to make that point, with the assistance of Couch
and Manning, when he does an ESPN interview to rebut Wichard's
charges. According to Condon, Wichard has declined to be
interviewed for the ESPN piece, which apparently will be at odds
with what appeared in the company's biweekly sports magazine
recently.
</P>
<P>
   Such contradictions were not the intention of what is called
branding, a marketing tool in which a company like ESPN or Disney
produces more than one side of a business (in this case, TV and
print media) and then uses them to promote the other. The idea is
to promote each other's product, not knock it, but Condon contends
his side of this issue was never fairly told in ESPN Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``ESPN Magazine says I'm doing Couch's deal for $50,000,''
Condon said. ``At least that's better than the Atlanta
Constitution, which said we were doing it for zero. When they get
it up to 3 percent, they'll be correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting ESPN TV to come in and do the flip side of this
story because this fee stuff is unfair and it's a problem with your
other clients. They've asked Wichard to be interviewed and he told
them he wouldn't cooperate. We'll see how this ends up. We haven't
undercut our fees.''
</P>
<P>
   The same cannot be said for what some scouts have done to Couch
in recent months. If you believe his critics, he has gone from
being the most accurate and reliable passer available to a guy who
can't throw this and can't throw that.
</P>
<P>
   Smith supposedly is rising faster than flood waters and is in a
flat-footed tie with Couch and Williams, yet all of this has been
accomplished without a single college football game having been
played since January, which led Condon to laughingly comment,
``When we signed Tim, I thought he was a great player. Now I think
his arm got cut off.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no different than what happened with Peyton last year.
All of a sudden Peyton was the thinking man but (Ryan) Leaf had the
arm. Now that's what Tim's going through.''
</P>
<P>
   That may come to an end Sunday when Couch finishes a private
workout for the Cleveland Browns in Lexington, Ky., that will be
run by head coach Chris Palmer and watched by personnel boss Dwight
Clark and club president Carmen Policy, who reportedly is a big
Couch supporter.
</P>
<P>
   When IMG ran a private workout for NFL scouts a few weeks back,
word leaked out that the Browns were upset that Condon had
orchestrated the entire event, having it run by former Patriots
offensive coordinator Larry Kennan. Condon ran a similarly
structured workout a year ago for Manning without a hitch and had
made clear to the top drafting teams that Couch would willingly
work out again for them privately, as he is doing Sunday for the
Browns.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go through the teams and ask who they think will be
taken first _ and I talked with 18 of them this week about the
draft _ Tim went No. 1 to every one,'' Condon said. ``I expect
he'll be the guy. Akili Smith has a hell of an arm and he's a hell
of an athlete. He's deserving of a lot of consideration, as is
Ricky Williams and Tim Couch. But if I'm the new franchise with a
chance to put in place the linchpin for the next 10-15 years, you
have to believe Cleveland will select a quarterback and the facts
are Tim is the most proven and the best prepared for this.''
</P>
<P>
   Draft guru Gil Brandt doesn't disagree with that thinking,
although he tends to favor Smith's athleticism and arm strength
over Couch's. After spending two decades picking players for some
of the Dallas Cowboys' finest teams, Brandt knows well the value of
a runner like Williams, who may be the best back to come out in the
draft since Barry Sanders, but he also knows how far you go without
a top-flight quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   That's why he sees no way Cleveland can pass up one of the
top-rated ones, especially when you consider what will be left in
the college ranks after Couch, Smith, Donovan McNabb, and Daunte
Culpepper leave this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a little question about Couch's arm strength but Billy
Kilmer had no arm and he took his team to the Super Bowl,'' Brandt
said. ``People are very high on Smith because he had some of the
best practices any quarterback has ever had before the East-West
game, and that's going back to Terry Bradshaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either way, why I would take a quarterback if I was Cleveland
is that in the next two drafts I don't see a quarterback coming out
you can count on. Someone may do it but I don't see it for a couple
of years. So if you don't get the guy now, in this draft, you may
not be in a position to get him in the future. You can say what you
want about running backs but ours is a quarterback-driven game. You
can't ever pass a top-rated quarterback up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at history. Look at last year. Last year (Andre)
Wadsworth and (Charles) Woodson were the top two rated players by
everybody, but who went first? Manning and Leaf. It's simple. Would
you rather own an acre of land in downtown Boston or 500 acres in
Maine?''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Condon believes in the end Cleveland will do
what the Colts did a year ago and revert to what was the consensus
when the college season ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``In either situation (1 or 2) you make an awful lot of money,''
Condon said of the difference in drafting positions. ``So some of
this has to do with pride and legacy. For us, Cleveland would be
nice because our world headquarters is located there and it would
make it easier to market Tim but it doesn't really affect either
player financially very much.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I can't see a way Cleveland doesn't draft a quarterback
first really. Look at the last Super Bowl. John Elway was the
quarterback but each team had a running back taken in the sixth
round. If you look at the whole history of Carmen and Dwight in San
Francisco, they won with a lot of different running backs but only
two quarterbacks: Joe Montana and Steve Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though Ricky Williams might be the best player coming
out, No. 1-drafted running backs haven't fared that well. And backs
like Earl Campbell, who Williams is compared to, don't normally
last at the top more than six years. Quarterbacks can play for 15.
So the real possibility I see is quarterbacks going 1-2-3.''
</P>
<P>
   Condon sees an even greater possibility that his client will go
No. 1, for the same reason Manning went ahead of Leaf a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leigh Steinberg (Smith's agent) has a guy with a real upside,
like he had last year with Leaf,'' Condon said. ``But he also has a
24-year-old kid who only played one year of (major) college ball
(as a full-time starter), who has a DWI, an assault charge (which
Smith does not dispute), and a father who's a pain in the ass with
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim Couch is 3 inches taller, 20 pounds heavier, comes from a
ball-control offense with many similarities to the one Chris Palmer
will run in Cleveland, is completely clean off the field, and is
great on the blackboard. He has all the tools.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no sure bets in the world except that NFL personnel
people don't give a damn what an agent says about his player. Tim
understands that. But unless Cleveland thinks it can make Akili a
Hall of Famer in two or three years and can live with Ty Detmer in
the interim I don't see how they take anyone but Tim because you
don't have to hope for anything with him. He's got it all.''

   Seems there's a little tension between old friends Andy Reid and
Mike Holmgren. The Seahawks' new head coach, under whom Reid was
quarterbacks coach in Green Bay, questioned Reid's decision to name
untested free agent Doug Pederson the immediate Eagles starter
despite Pederson having never started an NFL game. ``You've got to
be careful of making promises like that because things happen and
you can let it wreck your team,'' Holmgren said. ``I'm not second
guessing that but you've got to be careful.'' When Reid learned
what his old mentor, who had also pursued Pederson, said of one of
his first decisions as the new Eagles coach, he claimed Holmgren
had made a similar promise to Pederson when trying to sign him.
``He told Doug he'd be the starter unless he threw every ball in
the dirt,'' Reid said . . . Some moves are hard to fathom. On
Thursday, the Packers obtained kick returner Jahine Arnold from the
Steelers for ``past considerations.'' Not long thereafter, they
withdrew their qualifying offer to return man Roell Preston, thus
making him a free agent. Arnold has been hurt the last two years (a
knee injury that kept him out all of 1997 and a broken collarbone
and finger injury that limited him last year) while Preston set
Packer records for kick-return yardage (1,497) and was selected to
the Pro Bowl last season. What did Arnold do to match that in 1998?
He returned three kickoffs for 78 yards and four punts for 19. I'd
never question the personnel decisions of Packer player guru Ron
Wolf, but go figure . . . I love Reggie White and a lot of what he
stands for, but his editorial in the Wall Street Journal last week
calling for women reporters to be barred from locker rooms went
around the bend and over the top. ``I can't see any legitimate
reason for forcing male athletes to walk around naked in front of
women who aren't their wives,'' White wrote. Me neither, but hasn't
anyone heard of a bathrobe and a towel in Green Bay? White also
wrote, ``I've seen a lot of female reporters and camerawomen ogling
guys in the locker room. There's not much a player can do about it,
which leads to a high level of frustration.'' First off, I think we
have a high-octane mix of ego and paranoia working here, but
wouldn't a simple robe end the frustration? As for the ogling of
men often 50-100 pounds overweight, I doubt it. If some of the guys
who play White's old position had a mirror and some common sense,
they'd cover themselves up voluntarily.

   Don't expect Cardinals linebacker Jamir Miller to be coming to
New England unless Arizona can land a top linebacking prospect
early in the draft. First off, Miller is not a pass-rushing threat.
With the exception of one game last season, he never has been and
never will be. He is a fundamentally sound outside backer who is
strong against the run but not especially elusive or overpowering
when rushing the passer. He could be helpful in New England in that
run-stopper role he played in Arizona, but he wants too much money
and seems hell-bent on being what he isn't and the Patriots can't
make him. Last week he dumped agent Steve Baker in favor of
Steinberg, who has a good relationship with Cardinals management.
Steinberg represents Arizona quarterback Jake Plummer and last year
ironed out a big-money deal that was good for both his client and
the team. He now hopes to work out a short-term solution for Miller
in Arizona that would significantly increase his salary from the
$710,000 of a year ago to either a one-year deal for $1.5 million
or a two-year deal in the $4 million range. That is still possible
despite the recent signing of veteran free agent Rob Fredrickson to
a four-year, $7.9 million contract. That deal happened only after
Miller rejected Arizona's two-year, $6 million offer, but the sides
are still willing to talk and the disappointed Miller, who thought
he'd land a deal in the $6.5 million-a-year range when free agency
began, may be ready to listen to the sound of something other than
his own voice screaming, ``Show me the money.'' . . . The Steelers
can't seem to get a break. The same day they signed Wayne Gandy to
a four-year, $14 million deal to relieve their problems at left
tackle, they learned right tackle Justin Strzelczyk had to undergo
his second knee operation in less than a year after reinjuring a
ligament torn last October during a rehab workout. It is unlikely
he will play this season, so don't send the ostensibly retired Will
Wolford a going-away present yet. Steelers coach Bill Cowher had
tried to convince Wolford to stay one more year and just play on
passing downs but Wolford had a retirement party at his home in
Kentucky . . . Gandy had a funny explanation for why he finally
agreed to terms with the Steelers, a team with whom he had been
negotiating for some time. ``Their offer came up and I came down,''
the former St. Louis Ram said. ``I got tired of pleading and
begging with them and they got tired of pleading and begging with
me. So we signed a deal.'' Gandy started the last 64 games for the
Rams.

   In the interest of fair play and equal time, here's what Leland
Hardy, one of Williams's agents, says of the draft possibilities:
``This is a high-stakes game of liar's poker right now. Teams all
talk about the players they don't really want but they all know
Ricky is the most prolific player in college football history. He
ran a 4.34 on Cleveland's clock and a 4.44 on Baltimore's at his
workout. He was 224 pounds (down 20 from two months ago) and
benched 225 22 times. There are no questions about Ricky Williams.
I thnk Ricky goes to Cleveland because they know his proven ability
to deliver. You don't pass on a once-in-a-lifetime back. Even if
you're leaning toward a quarterback for need, Ricky's ability so
far outshadows the rest they have to take him. The draft is all
about minimizing risk. What's the greater risk? An unproven
quarterback or a proven running back who was the greatest college
player in history?'' . . . Just for the record, here's one of the
things about Smith that concerns some teams. At Oregon, the coaches
reportedly had to use red and black checkers to help him understand
their offense. Red was the offense. Black was the defense. Early
confusion after arriving from junior college (and a three-year
stint in the Pittsburgh Pirates' minor league baseball system) kept
him on the bench and then sharing the position until early last
season, when he shined. Smith did well in postseason all-star games
and individual workouts this spring, but teams remember that just a
year ago he was suspended at Oregon for being involved in
fourth-degree assault, second-degree trespass, and harassment in
the wake of an incident outside a barroom. He was acquitted of the
assault charge but pleaded no contest to drunk driving and entered
an alcohol awareness program. When talent is as close as it is
between guys like Smith, Couch, and the other top-rated prospects,
such factors become magnified . . . This is how things can go as
the paranoia grows in the final days before the draft. Scouts are
worried about Williams's size 7 hands. They feel those small hands
have led him to fumble too often. Hey, you rush for 6,279 yards and
break 16 NCAA records, you might drop the ball a few times. Last
time I looked, he didn't drop the Heisman when they handed it to
him . . . On the other hand (pardon the pun), scouts are breathless
about Florida pass rusher Jevon Kearse, who has size 12 hands, ran
the 40 in 4.52 and 4.50 seconds at a recent workout, and had a
vertical leap of 40 1/2 inches. That's all well and good but he's
also a ``tweener'' without a real position unless he's playing
outside linebacker in a 3-4 defense. And that vertical leap won't
do him much good, by the way, since most tackles are taller than 40
1/2 inches. He won't be jumping over them to get to the quarterback
. . . When Eastern Michigan tackle L.J. Shelton is taken early in
the draft, don't be shocked if he looks familiar. His father is
former NBA star Lonnie Shelton, which probably explains some of the
unusual athletic ability he has packed into a 6-foot-5-inch frame
that is carrying more than 300 pounds.

   LOS ANGELES:conventional 35mm stock.
</P>
<P>
   Landmark titles include ``Everest,'' ``The Rolling Stones at the
Max,'' ``Wings of Courage'' with Val Kilmer, and ``To Fly,'' the
1976 film that was made for $500,000 and has grossed $150 million.
But ``Fantasia 2000'' is quite different, Scovin noted, and will
have profound effect on Imax.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue is that traditional Hollywood needs to see what
Imax's value will be as a distributor of more conventional
product,'' he said. ``So `Fantasia 2000' is really going to be a
case study because it will only be available in Imax.''
</P>
<P>
   Early buzz on the movie is positive, based on reaction from
those who have seen rough cuts, according to Scovin. But ``Fantasia
2000'' isn't a slam dunk, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney's marketing clout can get people into theaters in the
first week, but if nobody shows up after that, you have a real
problem,'' Scovin said. ``But Disney wouldn't be doing it if they
didn't feel confident that the movie in this format will be
breathtaking.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Disney alliance is a major boost for Imax's image.
Hollywood had been waiting for Imax to expand past its core
business of showing films like ``Into the Deep''; most had expected
its first mainstream movie would team it with Paramount for a
``Star Trek'' film.
</P>
<P>
   Imax had already been transforming itself from a stodgy
specialist with theaters next to museums and into a top-tier lure
at today's successful entertainment centers, which bristle with
bookstores, coffee houses and one-of-a-kind retailers. Of its 183
theaters, 58 are in so-called ``commercial'' locations; of the 76
sites in Imax's backlog, 68 are commercial and mostly as part of
multiplexes run by major chains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having an Imax has become a great branding statement because,
in the consumer's mind, you've made the location special,'' Gelfond
said. ``Since the Imax frequently sells out, spillover tends to go
into multiplex, and it's a lot cheaper to build than a stand-alone
because of the shared concession areas and walls.''
</P>
<P>
   The transformation of Imax has put its stock on a roller-coaster
this year. It went from $17 to over $29 last year, then topped $33
in January before Goldman Sachs removed Imax from its ``recommended
list'' and a surprise announcement that 1999 results would be flat.
The stock fell all the way to $15 before recovering.
</P>
<P>
   It's been trading in the $20 range ever since Bear Stearns
upgraded its rating to ``buy'' from ``attractive'' earlier this
month, citing ``Fantasia 2000'' and strong prospects for the
recently released ``Encounter in the Third Dimension.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no momentum people in the stock anymore,'' said
Scovin, who has a ``buy'' on the stock. ``We believe the market has
punished it as much as it should be punished.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the Imax story more than ever because it's a very
different fundamental situation than traditional theaters,''
Skislock said. ``They have the ability to distinguish themselves as
a brand far more than any studio except Disney.''
</P>
<P>
   For the longer term, Imax is in the right place at the right
time, Skislock said. It can take advantage of moviegoers' increased
preferences for unique films from the nonmajor studios such as
``Everest,'' ``The Full Monty'' and ``Life is Beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The playing field is more level between indies and majors
because indie product gives moviegoers an alternative to the
repetition of tasteless, violent studio product,'' he said.

`FANTASIA' RELEASE WILL RAISE IMAX'S PROFILE
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Imax Corp., best known for breathtaking
giant-screen documentaries about nature's wonders, looks like a big
Y2K winner already.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 1, 2000, Imax hopes to swap its status from niche player
to full-fledged Hollywood mainstreamer. That's when Imax becomes
exclusive exhibitor for The Walt Disney Co.'s ``Fantasia 2000,'' a
large-format version of one of animation's crown jewels, for the
first four months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were clearly looking to premiere a significant Hollywood
film in the Imax format so it was just perfect that Disney came
along with `Fantasia 2000,''' said Richard Gelfond, co-chairman and
chief executive of Imax. ``The two brands really create an event
atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fantasia 2000'' has been in the works for a dozen years and
combines six new segments with three from the 1940 original:
``Dance of the Hours,'' ``Nutcracker Suite'' and ``Sorcerer's
Apprentice.'' About half of the 200 or so Imax screens open by the
end of the year, following a five-city tour, will show the film,
marking the first time a full-length Hollywood feature has been
released in the giant-screen format.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal puts a significant stamp of approval on the Imax
format,'' said Richard Wayman, an analyst with Ohio Co. ``
`Fantasia 2000' is going to have a wide appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great, great deal for Imax,'' said Steven Bernard,
analyst with Everen Securities who has a ``buy'' rating on Imax. ``
`Fantasia 2000' is Disney's signature product, so putting it
through the Imax system before it goes into the rest of the world's
theaters really says something. It validates the giant-screen
technology and concept.''
</P>
<P>
   Imax, which leases projection systems to giant-screen theaters,
will receive a cut of grosses in exchange for work in
post-production, marketing and distribution. ``Fantasia 2000''
should help Imax increase the number of theaters from the current
183 to about 250 by the end of 2000, Gelfond said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fantasia 2000'' will be released in 2-D, but Imax executives
point out that digitally animated films could be released in Imax's
3-D format. ``Films such as a `A Bug's Life' scream to be shown in
Imax,'' co-chairman Bradley Wechsler told reporters following the
deal announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Gelfond said the partnership has perked interest from other
producers and noted 1999 will see as many as 20 new giant-screen
movies roll out, including one involving Michael Jordan's final
season as a player. He also said another of Hollywood's major
studios is likely to commit to a giant-screen project.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, Imax could become a full-fledged member of
Disney's global family should the partnership _ the corporate
equivalent of going on a date _ work out. Burbank-based Disney,
analysts note, could buy part of Imax much like it has invested in
Internet access specialist Infoseek, special-effects house
DreamQuest Images and computer-animation producer Pixar in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Logically, down the road, someone like Disney would be a
candidate to buy Imax out,'' Bernard said. ``Imax is probably
grooming itself for that.''
</P>
<P>
   William Scovin, a Ladenburg Thalman analyst, agreed. ``Imax
would be a logical fit for Disney, although Disney is not the only
one,'' he said. ``Imax would be a fit for content providers like
Sony or Fox _ an interesting outlet for someone wanting to do
family-oriented product.''
</P>
<P>
   The Imax format, which debuted 32 years ago at Expo '67, has
already achieved massive box office success thanks to ``Everest,''
the documentary that has topped $62 million in domestic grosses
despite never playing on more than 62 screens at once. Should
``Fantasia 2000'' succeed, the lingering idea that giant-screen
theaters are a fluke would be banished.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Fantasia 2000' does a great job of responding to Imax's
chicken-and-egg question, which has always been whether great films
will get made in a format that has limited distribution,'' said
entertainment consultant Kevin Skislock of Laguna Research
Partners. ``Now, they've effectively and methodically dealt with
that problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Skislock said ``Everest'' attracted millions who might not have
gone to an Imax theater otherwise, partly because it explained the
1996 tragedy that left eight climbers dead on the world's tallest
mountain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film clearly demonstrated the format's ability to convey a
powerful dramatic story line even though it did so with no planning
at all, no storyboards,'' he said. ``Who would have thought things
like a shot of two men in a tent conversing on a phone with one of
the climbers would have been that compelling?''
</P>
<P>
   Imax, which grew revenues 20 percent last year to $190 million,
makes money in three ways _ installing systems in new theaters,
which usually cost at least $8 million; a 7 percent fee from
grosses for licensing the projection systems; and the occasional
production of giant-screen films. About 200 films can play on Imax
systems, which use a 70-millimeter format that is 10 times larger
than conventional 35mm stock.

THANKS TO INJURIES, HMO ALL-STARS THRIVING
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A week into the rough and tumble of the new baseball season, the
best team in the land has already been identified.
</P>
<P>
   You can see it now, if only in your imagination, not rolling
around a diamond as it should be, but idling in some doctor's
waiting room, drumming its fingers or fighting over old People
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   It is the All-Injured Team, and as much as it hurts to say this,
show me a finer collection of All-Stars than this one.
</P>
<P>
   __ Catcher: Mike Piazza (whose swollen knee is a day-to-day
proposition).
</P>
<P>
   __ First baseman: Andres Galarraga (out for the year, battling
back from lymphoma).
</P>
<P>
   __ Second baseman: Delino DeShields (on the disabled list with a
broken thumb).
</P>
<P>
   __ Third baseman: Cal Ripken Jr. (missed games Wednesday and
Thursday with a stiff back).
</P>
<P>
   __ Shortstop: Alex Rodriguez (DL, knee).
</P>
<P>
   __ Outfielders: Moises Alou (DL, knee), Larry Walker (DL,
ribcage strain) and Jim Edmonds (DL, strained groin, ``irritated''
shoulder).
</P>
<P>
   __ Designated hitter: Mo Vaughn (DL, sprained ankle).
</P>
<P>
   I know he's a first baseman, but on a club this talented, guys
are willing to sacrifice to win.
</P>
<P>
   __ Starting ace: Kerry Wood (out for the year after elbow
surgery).
</P>
<P>
   __ Bullpen ace: Kerry Ligtenberg (out for the year after elbow
reconstruction).
</P>
<P>
   Our club even has a skipper.
</P>
<P>
   __ Manager: Joe Torre (recovering from prostate surgery).
</P>
<P>
   Who can beat that lineup?
</P>
<P>
   Torre's own New York Yankees? No. The Yankees' 1999 opening-day
lineup had 140 homers, 634 RBI and 109 steals last season; the
All-Injured team had 274 homers (better), 910 RBI (better), 114
steals (better).
</P>
<P>
   The winning American League All-Star team of '98? Maybe. Its
eight position players had 234 homers last year (exactly the same
as the All-Injured team), 784 RBI (slight edge) and 149 steals
(edge).
</P>
<P>
   So that's what we've got, a full-fledged major-league All-Star
team languishing now in some doctor's examination room, trying to
keep the paper gown closed in back and the thermometer under the
tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Among them, they own three home-run titles, two batting titles,
four Most Valuable Player awards and one unbreakable record.
</P>
<P>
   If only we could see them all on one field at the same time. Or
any ONE of them on one field at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   When Cal Ripken Jr. sits out back-to-back games _ his back
unstiffened in time for him to return to the Baltimore Orioles'
lineup Friday _ you know something's going around.
</P>
<P>
   Sports medicine can take pride in any number of advances that
have made life better for athletes. The replacement of ligaments
and tendons with unbreakable rubber bands is not among those
advances, unfortunately.
</P>
<P>
   ``(People) wonder why, because of the advances, they still get
hurt,'' said Charlie Strasser, the Dodgers' head trainer and an
executive in the Professional Baseball Athletic Trainers Society.
``It's because they're still human.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the old thing: God didn't put us on Earth to throw a
baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Or to run on a treadmill (which Alou was doing when he fell) or
to hop side to side over a small obstacle to build leg strength
(which is how Rodriguez got hurt).
</P>
<P>
   ``You still have the overuse syndrome in young kids,'' Strasser
said.
</P>
<P>
   In this enlightened age, youth leagues are better about limiting
pitchers' workloads. The trouble being, the serious kids play in
more than one league now.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason injuries don't seem to be generally declining is
that we hear about more of them than we did in olden economic days,
when a player had to grit his teeth and play with ``a sore elbow.''
</P>
<P>
   Strasser offered another explanation for the seeming epidemic:
With expansion, there's simply a lot more major-league skin for the
illness-and-injury bug to bite.
</P>
<P>
   So why is that blasted little insect picking on the stars?
</P>
<P>
   How about a major-league slogan for the new season? ``Baseball
Fever _ Catch It, or Your Favorite Player is Bound To.''

   WASHINGTON _ The United States committed 82 more warplanes
Saturday to NATO's campaign against Yugoslavia, and the alliance
promised an aerial attack of ``increasing ferocity'' when better
weather returned over the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the four bombing waves were canceled in the 24 hours
ending Saturday morning because of cloud cover, said Col. Konrad
Freytag, a NATO spokesman. He said some missile attacks, less
dependent on weather, were launched from U.S. and British ships.

<P>
   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees reported the exodus of
mainly ethnic Albanians from the Serbian province of Kosovo had
topped a half-million persons.
</P>
<P>
   In Tirana, Albania, international officials reported that more
than 4,000 new refugees from Kosovo crossed the Albanian border
Saturday and hundreds more were lined up on the Yugoslav side. The
troops of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic for several days
have vacillated between opening border points and pushing ethnic
Albanians out, or closing crossings and urging people to return to
their homes.

   The 19th day of NATO's airstrikes got under way as Serb
Christians prepared to celebrate Orthodox Easter today. Alliance
officials belittled Milosevic's claim of a cease-fire for the
holiest day of the Orthodox Christian calendar, pointing to
continued assaults on ethnic Albanian villages in Kosovo, populated
mostly by Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is the southern province of Serbia, one of the two pieces
of the remaining Yugoslavia. NATO has demanded that Milosevic
withdraw his forces from Kosovo and allow a cease-fire to be
policed by an international force.
</P>
<P>
   The additional U.S. planes brings the total committed by
Washington to approximately 480 _ out of the total of about 680
which NATO member nations have dedicated to the force.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said he expected ``other allies
will be announcing force enhancement soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon detailed the commitment as 24 more F-16 fighters armed
with HARM anti-radar missiles, four more tank-hunter A-10
Thunderbolts, six radar-jamming EA-6B Prowlers, 39 KC-135 and two
KC-10 refueling tanker aircraft and seven C130 transports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, it will allow us to increase the intensity of the
air campaign over Kosovo and Yugoslavia,'' Bacon said, providing
``more deep strike capacity.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Henderson, British armed forces minister, declared: ``When
the weather clears, the bombing will continue with increasing
ferocity.'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said allied planes
flew strikes Saturday ``in spite of weather.''
</P>
<P>
   The state-run Tanjug news agency carried a commentary Saturday
by the Yugoslav military that called NATO's strategy a ``fiasco.''
</P>
<P>
   The alliance countered by pointing out that half of Yugoslavia's
most modern fighter planes had been destroyed in the air campaign
and that two of the three major army headquarters had been
decimated.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said half of the Yugoslav fuel stocks
have been destroyed, ``and it's increasingly difficult for the
Yugoslav army units to move the remaining fuel stocks around, to
get them into the units in the field.''
</P>
<P>
   The allies' focus on more planes and more robust attacks came as
pressure mounted for NATO to at least begin to plan for the
deployment of allied ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   David Leavy, a White House spokesman for the national security
council, said President Clinton continued to believe ``we can
achieve our objectives through the phased air campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to persist until we prevail,'' he said. ``And
we're confident that day by day as we attack his military
infrastructure we can achieve our objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   Macedonian President Kiro Gligorov told the Turkish daily
Hurriyet that he would not allow a land offensive into Kosovo to be
launched from his country, Reuters news service reported. NATO
already has 12,000 troops in Macedonia preparing to police what the
alliance hopes will be a cease-fire in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In the Republican weekly radio address, Rep. Heather Wilson,
R-N.M., called on Clinton to give Congress ``a complete picture of
the situation in the Balkans _ the effects of the bombing, the
military and nonmilitary options and the risks of each.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our airmen and sailors and soldiers have done their jobs well,
but it is unlikely that airpower can stop a door-to-door campaign
of repression,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress returns from a spring break this week, some
Republicans are expected to press for votes on resolutions that
would prohibit use of U.S. forces in a ground attack without
specific authorization of the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his weekly radio address, did not mention the
Yugoslav fighting but talked about the administration's ``welfare
to work'' program. Clinton played golf Saturday afternoon at the
Army-Navy Club in suburban Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Shea insisted that the air assault has ``inflicted a hell of a
lot of damage, quite frankly, on the Yugoslav armed forces.'' He
said that Yugoslav army and special police forces were ``feeling
the pressure'' and ``are essentially static.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are hiding themselves because obviously they now have to
contend with the serious risks of attacks from NATO,'' Shea said.
``They're off the main roads and seeking smaller roads now for
their operations. And of course, they are running out of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not good news that they're still there, but it is good
news that they're finding it increasingly difficult to operate.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same Pentagon briefing at which the additional planes
were announced, Maj. General Charles Wald, vice-director of
strategic planning for the joint chiefs of staff, said it could be
as long as a month before 24 U.S. Apache attack helicopters could
be thrown fully into the NATO attack.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopters, which starred in the Persian Gulf War, allow
close-in strikes on ground troops and tanks and are largely
impervious to bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   At NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, Shea said it would
take an additional 124 flights into Tirana, capital of Albania, to
import the helicopters, accompanying multiple-launch rocket system
and the equipment and personnel to get the Apaches up and running.
</P>
<P>
   Bad weather has also delayed some of the equipment flights into
Tirana, where the airport is still being upgraded by U.S.
personnel. The airport is overwhelmed with flights of military
equipment and humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said ``NATO is in overdrive'' to provide food and supplies
for refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the `ethnic cleansing' continues,'' Shea said,
detailing ``the distressing almost unbelievable pictures'' emerging
from camps in Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Shea said another village was affected Friday. ``Again, the
usual story which is now becoming the daily routine of everybody
being stripped of their identify cards, their valuables, whatever,
being frog-marched to the border and then pushed over.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at least I imagine they're the lucky ones _ they're still
alive and can be cared for by the humanitarian relief
organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Clinton spoke by telephone with U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan, thanking him for his statement Friday
asking Milosevic to withdraw all Yugoslav forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Leavy said Clinton told Annan that the U.N. leader's statement
made clear ``there is a united front and that President Milosevic
must end his brutality and give the Kosovars the dignity and
security that they deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Shea said that because Annan's statement ``was identical to the
one that you've heard from NATO countries once again shows that it
is not simply NATO that has formulated the objectives, but the
entire international community.''

U.S. PROMISES MORE WARPLANES FOR NATO CAMPAIGN AGAINST YUGOSLAVIA

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States committed 82 more warplanes
Saturday to NATO's campaign against Yugoslavia, and the alliance
promised an aerial attack of ``increasing ferocity'' when better
weather returned over the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the four bombing waves were canceled in the 24 hours
ending Saturday morning because of cloud cover, said Col. Konrad
Freytag, a NATO spokesman. He said some missile attacks, less
dependent on weather, were launched from U.S. and British ships.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees reported the exodus of
mainly ethnic Albanians from the Serbian province of Kosovo had
topped a half-million persons.
</P>
<P>
   In Tirana, Albania, international officials reported that more
than 4,000 new refugees from Kosovo crossed the Albanian border
Saturday and hundreds more were lined up on the Yugoslav side. The
troops of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic for several days
have vacillated between opening border points and pushing ethnic
Albanians out, or closing crossings and urging people to return to
their homes.

POLLRD LIKELY OUT FOR SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ USC's spring scrimmage Saturday was dampened by
the news that sophomore middle linebacker Mike Pollard tore knee
ligaments two days earlier and is likely lost for the season.
</P>
<P>
   An official announcement from the university is pending, but
Pollard apparently injured his knee during Thursday's practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look good,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Without Pollard, junior Zeke Moreno becomes the full-time
starting middle linebacker. There had been some thought to letting
Pollard start in the middle, with Moreno staying outside. Moreno
missed the scrimmage to be in a wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Pollard's injury, there were some encouraging signs
during Saturday's 56-play scrimmage at Howard Jones Field.
</P>
<P>
   Notably, sophomore tailback Sultan McCullough seems light years
ahead of last season and ready to challenge Chad Morton for playing
time. McCullough gained 99 yards in 13 carries with a long run of
21 yards, and scored on a 10-yard run. He also had a fumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``The running was particularly good,'' Hackett said.
``Particularly (McCullough). Last fall, like most freshmen, you're
not sure what to do. He's working his way through things. He's
developing.''
</P>
<P>
   With Hackett hoping to use more split-back formations,
McCullough could potentially line up aside Morton in the backfield.
</P>
<P>
   The other player to emerge was senior wide receiver Windrell
Hayes, who will start opposite R. Jay Soward. Hayes had five
receptions for 113 yards. Soward caught a 39-yard touchdown pass.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacks Carson Palmer and Mike Van Raaphorst were both
solid. Palmer completed 7 of 11 passes for 138 yards and one
touchdown; Van Raaphorst was 5 of 6 for 77 yards.
</P>
<P>
   If the offense had a weak spot, it was the offensive line, which
had several false-start penalties. There were 16 penalties, with
six on offense and 10 by the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost our poise far too many times,'' Hackett said. ``There
were far too many penalties. Other than that, I was delighted.''
</P>
<P>
   Free safety Darnell Lacy led the defense with six tackles.
Converted quarterback John Fox had five tackles in his first game
at linebacker. Defensive end Lonnie Ford had two sacks.
</P>
<P>
   USC continues spring practice through April 23. Practices are
open to the public.

MISSING GIRL FOUND IN BOOKSTORE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to update)   By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 14-year-old girl who was reported missing on
Thursday night was found Saturday afternoon at an East Village
bookstore, where she had apparently been reading for two days while
the police and more than 70 volunteers searched for her across
Manhattan, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives said that the girl, Maureen Lynch, failed to return
home because of worries about her low grades.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen's parents, Mary and Robert Lynch, at first suspected
that their daughter's disappearance was related to her medical
condition, hydrocephalus, which causes a chronic buildup of fluid
in the brain and occasional fainting spells.
</P>
<P>
   Her orthodontist, Dr. Vincent LaBruna, told them that Maureen
appeared pale and light-headed during a Thursday afternoon
appointment, the last time she was seen before vanishing.
</P>
<P>
   When she did not come home at 7 p.m. that night, Mrs. Lynch
called the police and then began organizing a search party. Among
those who passed out more than 10,000 fliers Friday and Saturday
were classmates from the Convent of the Sacred Heart, a private
school on East 91st Street where Maureen is a ninth grader, and
residents from the Stuyvesant Town neighborhood where the family
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're grateful for all the help we received,'' said Martha
Hayden, Maureen's grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday at 6:30 p.m., a customer at the Barnes &AMP; Noble on Astor
Place recognized Maureen from one of the fliers and called the
police. An officer arrived and took her to the 13th Precinct
station house, where she was reunited with her family.
</P>
<P>
   A sales clerk at the store said she noticed Maureen in the young
adult section over the past two days. Detectives said Maureen spent
both nights sleeping unnoticed in an out-of-the-way portion of the
lobby in the building where she lives.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hayden, who spoke to her granddaughter, said Maureen was
embarrassed. ``She had no idea there was such a fuss over her,''
she said. ``She feels really bad about that.''

WORM REPRISES ROLE IN LATE SHOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Somewhere out there is an imaginary line
drawn by Lakers management, and though it's unclear just where the
line is, suffice to say Dennis Rodman is perilously close to
crossing it.
</P>
<P>
   In a now-familiar scene, Rodman arrived 65 minutes late to
practice Saturday, a day after he refused to re-enter the fourth
quarter of the Lakers' victory over Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   If it sounds familiar, it should: exactly two weeks ago, Rodman
skipped a Saturday practice, a day after refusing to re-enter the
fourth quarter against Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   That transgression led to meetings with management and coach,
who were assured Rodman would get his act together. It lasted two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you gonna write about this?'' Rodman asked a group of
reporters, upon entering the Forum. Then he walked toward the Forum
floor, threw his hand in the air and muttered something about being
``persecuted.''
</P>
<P>
   After spending the rest of practice riding a stationary bike,
Rodman reappeared and told reporters, ``You've got a story today.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a story Kurt Rambis could do without. The Lakers' coach
said he did not speak with Rodman and had not resolved the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman apparently called ahead to say he had to pick up his son
and would be late, but Rambis said he hasn't determined whether the
absence is excused.
</P>
<P>
   Would the troubled forward start today's game against Seattle?
</P>
<P>
   ``If he shows up,'' Rambis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't talk to Dennis about anything. I had other things I
had to deal with today,'' Rambis said, then repeated his Rodman
philosophy: ``I'm not gonna freak out about that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not what I wanted to happen,'' he said, ``but hey, it
happened.... I'm disappointed he didn't show up to practice on
time, yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   It's generally believed that Lakers management warned Rodman two
weeks ago that any further problems could prompt his release.
Rambis wouldn't confirm if that's the case and said he doesn't feel
such action is warranted yet.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the Lakers simply practiced without Rodman, then
brushed off any concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a Kurt Rambis problem, it's not a Shaq O'Neal problem,''
O'Neal said. ``If I was in control, I ain't gonna say what I would
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant laughed at the predictable questions and said
Rodman's absence isn't a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty much old habit. You just don't think about it too
much,'' he said. ``If it comes out (Sunday) that he doesn't know
the game plan, doesn't know the rotation, what we're doing then
that's different. I don't think it's gonna happen because he
prepares so much for the game. But if it does happen, then that's a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   And what if, come playoff time, Rodman refuses to re-enter a
game in the fourth quarter?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, come playoff time, Dennis will be there,'' Bryant said.
``I'm not gonna even worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew what we were getting into when we signed Dennis,'' he
said. ``The method of thinking was his positives would outweigh the
negatives. So far, they have.''
</P>
<P>
   But certainly, Rodman is testing the coach's patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have three kids,'' Rambis said, ``I have plenty of
patience.''

McCARRON UNRAVELS ON 12TH HOLE 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Scott McCarron had a chance to do what no Masters
participant has ever done, what no one else in this year's field
possibly could do. After carding rounds of 69 and 68, the former
UCLA golfer was looking to become the first golfer in the history
of the tournament to post four sub-70 scores.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods didn't do it during his record-breaking performance
in 1997 (he opened with a 70) and McCarron won't do it this week.
The only golfer here to shoot under 70 the first two days, McCarron
struggled to a 4-over-par 76 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The par-3 12th was his undoing. McCarron carded a triple-bogey 6
on the hole after he sent his tee shot over the green and never
found his ball. After 54 holes, he stands 3-under par, four shots
behind Jose Marie Olazabal.
</P>
<P>
   The 12th hole was a microcosm of McCarron's day. After hitting
67 percent of the greens in regulation the first two rounds, he hit
only 7 of 18 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pins today were very difficult,'' said the long-hitting
McCarron. ``If you were a little bit off, it showed. I wasn't that
precise today. ''
</P>
<P>
   __ McCarren involves the fans: Dot Baker, 81, had no idea she
would become part of the Masters action when she parked her chair
in her traditional spot left of the first fairway.
</P>
<P>
   McCarron hooked his tee shot into the left woods and it came to
rest next to her chair and cane. Rules officials asked her not to
move until McCarron arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked if I could get up and they wouldn't let me so I just
sat there,'' said Mrs. Baker, whose late husband Tom used to work
as a scorer for the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got the best seat in the house,'' said McCarron with a
laugh. He marked his ball with a tee while Mrs. Baker got up and
removed her chair and cane.
</P>
<P>
   McCarron, who started the day one shot behind Jose Maria
Olazabal, hit his next shot off the pine straw into the front
bunker. He blasted out and two-putted for a bogey.
</P>
<P>
   __ Woods in the hunt: Tiger Woods shot a quiet 70 to finish five
strokes behind Jose Maria Olazabal and four behind Greg Norman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in good shape,'' Woods said. ``Six shots is not that hard
to make up on this course. I need to get a few birdies early and
get some momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods has parred the first seven holes in each of the last two
rounds, this after going 1-under-par in the same stretch on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't recorded a sub-70 round here since his closing 69 in
1997. His average score in the ensuing seven rounds is a 71.3.
</P>
<P>
   __ O'Meara in the clear: There were only four players who shot
better scores Saturday than Mark O'Meara. A 69 positioned the
defending champion nicely for another final-round charge.
</P>
<P>
   Although you'd have to convince him of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have much of a chance, to be honest,'' O'Meara said
after shooting a 3-under-par 69 to get to 1-under 215. ``I'm
probably out of the tournament unless there is a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Too bad he couldn't enjoy it more. O'Meara was sore at the
sun-baked 17th green.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they want to play the golf course tough,'' said
O'Meara, who attended college at Long Beach State, ``but that green
is harder than the L.A. freeways.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara was playing well and had gone 2-under before he bogeyed
the 17th. His 9-iron approach hit the green and bounded well over
the putting surface, almost to the 18th tee.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to just land right over the bunker and pray,'' he
said. ``I know we're pretty good players, but you're dealing with
landing areas of about 5 feet. That's not that easy.''
</P>
<P>
   He feels he's too far back for another Sunday charge to the
green jacket.
</P>
<P>
   __ New set of rules: Six golfers in this year's field would not
have qualified under the guidelines that will be used next year.
They are Billy Andrade, Rocco Mediate, Olin Browne, Gabriel
Hjertstedt, Joe Durant and J.P. Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   Those players made this field because they won a PGA Tour event
in the past year. Next year, that won't be good enough. That
qualification standard is being thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   Andrade, Mediate and Browne made the cut but were a cumulative
11-over through two rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Will Nicholson, chairman of the competition committee, said the
new standards will ensure a strong field because the more
consistent golfers will be invited.

UCLA SWEEPS ARIZONA IN SOFTBALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Perhaps it's strange that a team more than 30
games above .500 considers itself not playing well.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to UCLA softball, home of the nation's No. 1-ranked
team, where defensive letdowns and numerous come-from-behind
victories have people suggesting a lack of consistency.
</P>
<P>
   For one day, at least, the fears disappeared as the Bruins swept
No. 2 Arizona 6-2 and 3-2 on Saturday in a Pac-10 doubleheader at
Easton Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why: the Bruins (38-1, 7-1) committed no errors and never
trailed in sweeping the Wildcats (33-7, 5-3) at home for the first
time in four years. Arizona tied the score 2-2 in each game, only
to see UCLA take the lead on Stacey Nuveman hits.
</P>
<P>
   Nuveman's bloop single to center in the sixth inning drove in
two runs in the first game, and her 19th home run of the season, a
solo shot to left in the bottom of the fifth, was the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was a step in the right direction,'' Nuveman said, ``but
we haven't played our best yet. We haven't run on all cylinders, as
we like to say. Our potential we haven't shown.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, Arizona coach Mike Candrea said, he doesn't
want to see the Bruins when they're peaking.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, UCLA has numerous people it can rely on for offensive
punch. But on Saturday, first baseman Julie Marshall was 0 for 6
and shortstop Lyndsey Klein was 1 for 5.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Julie Adams fared better, going 3 for 7 with 2
RBI, although her two-run single followed Nuveman's in the first
game. Monroe High School graduate Lupe Brambila was 3 for 5 and
drove in the Bruins' first run of the day. Christie Ambrosi, who
had been slumping, went 3 for 5 with an RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the most critical moments, only Nuveman stepped forward
offensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team does not rely on any one individual,'' UCLA coach
Sue Enquist said. ``You can take what Nuveman has done lately and
it just appears she has come through so many times. She's one of
the most prolific student-athletes to put on a uniform at UCLA.''
</P>
<P>
   Nuveman's heroics gave pitcher Courtney Dale (19-0) two
victories Saturday, which Dale said was a first in her UCLA career.
</P>
<P>
   Dale went the distance in the first game, scattering six hits
and giving up two earned runs, coming via Katie Swan's home run and
RBI groundout. In the second game, she relieved Amanda Freed in the
fifth inning and pitched 21/3 scoreless innings.
</P>
<P>
   And the UCLA defense, which let down with three errors in a loss
last week at Washington, was flawless Saturday. It held leadoff
batter and Saugus High graduate Nicole Giordano hitless (0 for 8),
and it handed the Wildcats their third consecutive loss. Arizona,
the defending national runner-up, lost the second game of its
Wednesday doubleheader against Cal State Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not able to play seven innings right now,'' Candrea
said. ``It's been one inning that's come back to haunt us.It's been
a long time, I tell you, since we've had seven losses at this
time.''

NORMAN LOST BALL, BUT FOUND HIS COMPOSURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ It was out there, somewhere betwixt the dogwoods
and the azaleas, amid billowing pillows of Golden Bell and Asiatic
Jasmine, in the clasped hands of Amen Corner, that Greg Norman was
supposed to have gone belly-up.
</P>
<P>
   Always has. And, some say, always will.
</P>
<P>
   Not so poetically, of course. In the past, when Norman has
choked away a Masters, there hasn't been much reason to scythe
through the sonnets and wade into the horticultural digest.
</P>
<P>
   But here we were in yesterday's third round, watching Norman,
Augusta National's eternal prisoner, waist deep in the flora and
fauna behind hole No. 12. A human metaphor, if you will.
</P>
<P>
   Clawing at the jasmine and azaleas. Combing. Searching.
Thinking.
</P>
<P>
   And just what was Greg Norman thinking?
</P>
<P>
   ``Find the \Rblank\S ball! What do you think was going through
my mind?'' Norman replied.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, poetry.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, lost golf balls are quite ordinary. At Rockwood
or Z. Boaz. When you or I play.
</P>
<P>
   But as Norman said, ``I'd like to know how many balls have been
lost on the back of the 12th green in the third round of a major
championship like the Masters?''
</P>
<P>
   By rule, he had five minutes to find his tee shot on the par-3
hole. He had his caddie, Tony Navarro, along with playing partner
Lee Janzen and his caddie, all rummaging through the hallowed
shrubbery, while Rae's Creek gurgled nearby. And he also had
green-jacketed tournament officials, tapping their feet, jingling
pocket change, and probably reminding Norman that if he didn't
hurry up, CBS was going to cut to another Cadillac commercial.
</P>
<P>
   No pressure. It was only the third-round lead of this 63rd
Masters that was at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll give 500 bucks if anybody will go out and find that ball
on 12,'' Norman announced in the interview room.
</P>
<P>
   He never found it. But poignantly, Norman unearthed both his
composure and his golf game after his adventures through Amen
Corner.
</P>
<P>
   With the most often-rhapsodized, well-chronicled 18 holes in
golf left to play today, Norman can be found in a familiar
position:
</P>
<P>
   On the brink of the Masters leader board. Gulp.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same Norman who has never won at Augusta National,
but has finished second _ often accompanied by a mushroom cloud _
thrice. This is the same Norman who has finished in second place
more than any golfer (27 times) in PGA Tour history.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it isn't the same Norman.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the simmer of losing his ball yesterday _ which cost him
two strokes _ Norman stalked back to the tee box, plopped his
second tee shot 22 feet from the pin, and then rolled in his putt
for what could end up being one of most memorable bogeys in
tournament history.
</P>
<P>
   The ``old'' Norman also might not have recovered when he bogeyed
the very next hole, falling two strokes _ and seemingly reeling _
behind leader Jose Maria Olazabal.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is I feel much better about myself because of
what's happened in the last 12 months,'' Norman explained.
</P>
<P>
   He has had shoulder surgery and, more importantly, discovered
some much-needed mental chicken soup. During his months off from
tournament golf, he found himself spending quality time with
teenage daughter Morgan-Leigh and going to his son Gregory's
football games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get me wrong,'' Norman said. ``Tomorrow I'm going out to
play and win because that's what I'm here for. But you realize
there are other things around.''
</P>
<P>
   So here we go again. Greg Norman, again, sits an arm's length
away from winning the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   Don't say it. Don't even think it.
</P>
<P>
   Norman was the first golfer in PGA tour history to earn $10
million. He has won tournaments in 13 countries.
</P>
<P>
   But here in Augusta, where the dogwood blooms alongside the
camellias, where the rough isn't called rough but the ``second
cut,'' where the gallery is called ``patrons'' and the term
``bikini wax'' can get a TV guy fired, and where so many
Faulkner-come-latelies have crafted sonnets in ode to the great
toon-uh-mint, Norman has been shut out.
</P>
<P>
   You think people are going to be tuning in today to watch
Olazabal, the Spaniard with bad feet?
</P>
<P>
   No, here in Georgia, the day looms as another NASCAR
extravaganza. ``Crash'' Norman, racing headlong into Rae's Creek,
the Eisenhower Tree and Amen Corner. His wheels didn't come flying
off yesterday, but there's always today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said that I don't live in the past,'' Norman said
yesterday. ``I've never been a believer in crying over spilled
milk.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can tell you is that I'm here right now with a chance to
win tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   And we all know what that means. Here in Augusta. Gulp.

EDMONDS DUE BACK WEDNESDAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Tex. _ Center fielder Jim Edmonds has remained in
Anaheim to get treatment on his strained groin and sore shoulder
but is expected to join the club in the next few days and be back
in the lineup in Oakland on Wednesday when he's eligible to come
off the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't hit since March 29 in Arizona, but Edmonds won't need
a rehab assignment, manager Terry Collins said. Just a couple days
of batting practice and Edmonds will be ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may sound crazy, but this guy can hit in January,''
Collins said. ``He's a special player. We'll get him some BP and
he'll be fine. I for one don't think he needs a rehab assignment.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Fastpitch past: Collins' bio in the Angels media guide has a
curious gap. It shows that he was a player for the Dodgers'
Triple-A team in Albuquerque from 1976-78, and again in 1980. But
under 1979, it says only ``Did not play.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins explained that in 1979 he managed a fastpitch softball
team in his hometown of Midland, Mich. He said the team won a world
championship.
</P>
<P>
   __ Taking what he can get: Orlando Palmeiro was in the starting
lineup again Saturday _ batting leadoff and playing left field _
for the fourth game in a row. It might not last long with Edmonds
due back Wednesday, but Palmeiro is trying to make the most of it.
Friday, he led off the game with his first career home run.
Saturday he had singles in his first two at-bats, including an RBI
bunt single with two out.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're starting, you have to have a mindset of what you
want to do,'' Palmeiro said. ``For me, I want to see a lot of
pitches, get on base, move guys over. I think it takes a while to
settle down and get in a comfort zone. You realize you don't have
to do it all in one day.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Hot Salmon: Tim Salmon went into Saturday's game with the
highest batting average by a Texas opponent in the history of the
club. Salmon's lifetime batting average against the Rangers was
.395 (100 for 253).
</P>
<P>
   Also, his two hits Friday gave Salmon 927 in his career, passing
Wally Joyner (925) for sixth on the Angels all-time list.

</P>
<P>
   It was all I could do to crawl here along the dry, scorched
desert to type out this report with fingers transformed into sticks
of beef jerky by the unrelenting fireball hovering about 30 feet

</P>
<P>
   But wait, you say. What about that fancy new retractable dome
ballpark in downtown Phoenix? I saw it on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Trickery. Computer graphics.
</P>
<P>
   It's actually a sound stage in Burbank. And the so-called
ballplayers are rejects from soap operas. (If you've seen them
play, you'd know this.)
</P>
<P>
   For years I was an accomplice in this monumental frame-up. I
told friends back east about the beautiful weather, the lovely
neighborhoods, the unrestrained opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   I was a collaborator.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that same right-coast conspiracy wants you to abandon your
comfortable residences in the crowded East and Mid west _
presumably so they'll have have more room for their fancy estates.
</P>
<P>
   And you've done it. Hundreds of thou sands of you moved here.
</P>
<P>
   And you keep coming.
</P>
<P>
   Pulling up stakes and heading west, fooled by doctored images of
a lovely metropolis that, in fact, looks more like a piece of burnt
toast with pencils stuck in it. &QL; 
IT'S AN EVIL SCHEME
</P>
<P>
   It's this simple:
</P>
<P>
   If you move to Arizona, you'll die.
</P>
<P>
   First, there's the cacti. You can't take a step anywhere
outdoors without getting stuck by some unholy spur.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, your foot first lands on the poison-filled
tail of the scorpions that cover the bare, brown earth like a
skittering blanket of beastly barbs.
</P>
<P>
   The overseers of this evil scheme will tell you I'm lying.
</P>
<P>
   They'll say I'm one of those Eastern transplants who drifted
here some years back, found the place full of beauty and
possibilities, and now want to keep it from becoming overcrowded by
those drawn to the same Southwestern paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe it. These people will stop at nothing.
</P>
<P>
   They've even lied to you about the rat tlesnakes, making it seem
as if the slither ing monsters live in the desert under rocks and
prefer to keep to themselves. In fact, I'm surrounded by rattlers
as I type this, their chattering tails like hailstones on a tin
roof.
</P>
<P>
   I'm convinced some of the serpents were placed near me by
conspiracy opera tives hoping one of the vipers will _ OUCH! _
plunge his venomous fangs into me, silencing the one critic of

   It's actually a sound stage in Burbank. And the so-called

told friends back east about the beautiful weather, the lovely

<P>
   Now, that same right-coast conspiracy wants you to abandon your
comfortable residences in the crowded East and Mid west _
presumably so they'll have have more room for their fancy estates.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   It's this simple:
</P>
<P>
   If you move to Arizona, you'll die.
</P>
<P>
   First, there's the cacti. You can't take a step anywhere
outdoors without getting stuck by some unholy spur.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, your foot first lands on the poison-filled
tail of the scorpions that cover the bare, brown earth like a
skittering blanket of beastly barbs.
</P>
<P>
   The overseers of this evil scheme will tell you I'm lying.
</P>
<P>
   They'll say I'm one of those Eastern transplants who drifted
here some years back, found the place full of beauty and
possibilities, and now want to keep it from becoming overcrowded by
those drawn to the same Southwestern paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe it. These people will stop at nothing.
</P>
<P>
   They've even lied to you about the rat tlesnakes, making it seem
as if the slither ing monsters live in the desert under rocks and
prefer to keep to themselves. In fact, I'm surrounded by rattlers
as I type this, their chattering tails like hailstones on a tin
roof.
</P>
<P>
   I'm convinced some of the serpents were placed near me by
conspiracy opera tives hoping one of the vipers will _ OUCH! _
plunge his venomous fangs into me, silencing the one critic of
their crooked coalition in a matter of sec. . . &QL;

ARREST MADE IN KILLING OF NEW JERSEY POLICEMAN  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to update, ID suspect)  By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 24-year-old New Jersey man was arrested and charged
Saturday in the fatal shooting of an Orange, N.J., police officer
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The man, identified by the police as Terrance Everett, was
arrested early Saturday at his home in East Orange after scores of
police officers spent 24 hours scouring the streets of Orange, a
2.2-square-mile city of 29,000 residents northwest of Newark, and
nearby communities.
</P>
<P>
   He was charged with murder, criminal possession of a weapon and
robbery, said Ray Weiss, a spokesman for the Essex County
Prosecutor's office.
</P>
<P>
   The robbery charges were for two separate incidents in which,
the police say, Everett used a gun to accost people on the street
just minutes before he was stopped by the officer he is accused of
killing, Joyce Anne Carnegie.
</P>
<P>
   Everett was being held at the Essex County Jail Saturday night,
with bail set at $1 million, Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
   Details about Everett were unavailable Saturday night. Weiss
said he could not provide information about Everett's occupation,
his address, or whether he had a criminal record. Everett has an
unlisted phone number.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carnegie, 38, was shot in the head and abdomen at close
range after approaching Everett, who matched the description of the
robbery suspect, the authorities said. The victim's younger sister,
Gayle Carnegie, said the police called Saturday morning ``to say
they have the guy in custody and they would be getting back to us
with the details of the arrest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just so overjoyed to know that they caught the guy so
quickly,'' said Ms. Carnegie, a nurse's aide who lives in Newark.
``We know that the police do their job, and we know that they love
one of their own fellow police officers. They were out there all
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the officers searching for their colleague's killer
worked through the night, canvassing the streets, backyards and
parking lots of the normally quiet town in patrol cars with their
sirens blaring. The police director, Richard Conti, was said to
have stayed in his office from Friday until about 7 a.m. Saturday;
his assistant left at 1 a.m., only to return later in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, residents dropped bouquets at a makeshift memorial
near the site of the shooting, and friends and family members
lovingly recalled a woman who took seriously the role of the beat
cop as guardian of a community.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Carnegie was the first member of the Orange Police
Department to die in the line of duty in 33 years, and the second
female New Jersey officer ever killed on the job. Her death sent
the 113-member police force into emotional turmoil, and members of
the City Council spent Saturday morning at police headquarters
consoling grief-stricken officers.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Carnegie lived with her mother in North Plainfield,
where relatives gathered Saturday, sharing memories. She discovered
a love for law enforcement while working as a security guard at a
Sears department store, according to her mother, and continued to
work part-time as a guard at a clothing store when off-duty.
</P>
<P>
   Gayle Carnegie said her family was comforted by Gov. Christie
Whitman's presence at the hospital where Joyce Carnegie was taken
Thursday evening, and by her recent signing of a bill that made
death or life in jail without parole the only penalties for anyone
convicted of killing a police officer acting in the line of duty.
</P>
<P>
   A funeral has been scheduled for 11 a.m. Thursday at St.
Matthew's Church on Oakwood Avenue in Orange, Ms. Carnegie said.

   National Public Radio reported on Saturday that the United
States had aerial photographs of 96 freshly dug graves outside
Orahovac in southern Kosovo, where refugees have reported the
massacre of dozens of ethnic Albanian civilians.
</P>
<P>
   David Scheffer, the U.S. ambassador-at-large for war crimes,
said the new graves inside an old cemetery could hold evidence of a
massacre. ``The method of burial is very, very different from
traditional Albanian burial patterns,'' Scheffer told NPR. ``We
also see trekkage of heavy vehicles present near the area.''
</P>
<P>
   Western aid agencies and NATO have both been expressing deep
concern about the fate of ethnic Albanians driven from their homes
in Kosovo but unable to escape the province. The NATO spokesman,
Jamie Shea, said on Saturday that an estimated 200,000 people were
believed displaced within Kosovo.

OUTDOORS: AN INVENTOR WHO HELPED NOVICES CAST LIKE PROS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the fall of 1947, the fisherman R.D. Hull arrived at the
headquarters of Zero Hour Bomb Co. on Easton Street in Tulsa,
Okla., with a prototype of what would become America's most popular
fishing reel. It was made from the metal lid of a can of Folgers
Mountain Grown Drip Grind coffee, an 11-inch-long piece of wire, a
wooden sewing thread spool and braided nylon line.
</P>
<P>
   A West Texas watchmaker and inveterate tinkerer, Hull nailed his
contraption to a board and showed it to the general manager and
legal counsel of Zero Hour, which manufactured timed explosives
used in oil well drilling. He wanted to create a simple reel that
anyone could use without line snarls, and he got an idea for it
while watching a grocery store clerk pull string from a spool to
wrap a meat package.
</P>
<P>
   The most common reel types of the late 1940s had revolving
spools, and the models used for casting heavy lures and natural
baits had a notorious tendency to create line snarls, known as
backlashes. These occurred when the revolving spool turned faster
than the line departed the spool. It took great practice and
considerable patience to cast with a minimum amount of backlashing.
</P>
<P>
   Watching string come off a stationary spool made Hull realize
that backlashes could be avoided by using a fixed, rather than
revolving, spool. His timing was impeccable. Nylon was just
becoming established in the manufacture of monofilament fishing
line and would soon improve all aspects of angling. And, because
Zero Hour Bomb Co. was facing an expiring patent and a new postwar
technology landscape, it was ripe for new ideas.
</P>
<P>
   So ripe that in June 1949 the company produced 25 handmade
derivatives of Hull's can-cum-wire invention, called them
closed-faced reels, and never looked back. Within a few years Zero
Hour Bomb Co. had more of a business with fishing reels than time
bombs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956 a friend of the company asked that a reel be sent to his
friend President Dwight D. Eisenhower, an avid angler. A reel was
sent to the White House, where security personnel saw the name of
the company on the package and promptly put the unopened box into a
tub of water and called a bomb squad to defuse it.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after, the company changed its name to Zebco. It got out
of the explosives business, and, mainly on the strength of Hull's
idea, went on to become one of the world's largest fishing tackle
manufacturers. In 50 years Zebco has sold an estimated 220 million
of these reels and is a major producer of other reels, rods, and
boating supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The closed-face reel devised by R.D. Hull would eventually
become known to anglers as a spincast or spincasting reel. It is
easily distinguished by its push-button line release, and by a
cone-shaped cover or hood that shrouds a stationary spool, a line
pickup device, and a line-winding mechanism. The covered spool
remains stationary when line is wound, or spun, around it, and when
it is unwound during casting.
</P>
<P>
   To draw attention to spincasting reels and to prove that they
were simple to use, even by someone who had never fished, Zebco's
early marketing was creative, to say the least. Its first sales
representative, George Goetz, wore boxing gloves while making
demonstrations. Another, Bill Carter of Texas, appeared at sport
shows with an identically dressed chimpanzee; he announced that the
reel was so simple that even a chimp could cast it, then handed the
reel to the chimp, which did.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, Bill Carter cast a Zebco Model 11 spincasting reel
consecutively for 14 hours 14 minutes without a backlash. It was
calculated that he cast his five-eighths-ounce practice plug a
total distance of 70.9 miles in 3,453 backlash-free casts.
</P>
<P>
   Of the reel types that exist today, only the spincasting reel is
an entirely American invention, and it's still the easiest type of
reel to learn to use. A 5-year-old can learn to fish with
spincasting tackle in a short time but would have problems with any
other type of tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Durable and comparatively inexpensive, spincasting tackle is so
widely employed across North America that it ranks first in units
sold annually, with about half a dozen manufacturers producing it.
Nearly every spincasting reel comes spooled with line, which
eliminates the most basic rigging problem; no other reels are
supplied to consumers spooled by the manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   But this equipment is virtually ignored by the most avid anglers
in the United States. A relatively low line capacity and
inefficient gears that curb cranking power limit the spincasting
reel to light- to medium-duty freshwater fishing applications.
</P>
<P>
   R.D. Hull worked for Zebco until his retirement in January 1977.
He designed 26 reels and held 35 United States and 30 Canadian
patents. He was inducted into the Sporting Goods Industry Hall of
Fame in 1975, and died in December 1977 at 64.

PLANS FOR WILMINGTON'S SHIPS TAVERN DISTRICT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Del., Md.)  By MAUREEN MILFORD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Del. _ When Jack B. Coonin started work as a jewelry
repairman in 1939, the southern end of North Market Street, this
city's main thoroughfare, was a vibrant Jewish community with
mouth-watering aromas wafting out of its bakeries and
delicatessens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little Europe,'' said Coonin, 77. ``I would walk up
Market Street on Fridays to collect the work from the jewelry shops
for the next week. It was shoulder-to-shoulder people. I had to
stop to talk to everybody _ they weren't customers, they were
friends. It was a neat community, it really was. The only screaming
you heard was from the mynah bird in the bakery.''
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, Coonin has had to keep the door locked
during the day at his cluttered jewelry and antique shop at 231
North Market Street, just north of the Amtrak passenger station.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the buildings around him are vacant, and only 10 people
live in the block. With hardly any pedestrian traffic, Coonin has
kept afloat with customers he has had for more than 30 years. His
more than a century-old building was badly in need of extensive
repair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was dying of old age,'' said Coonin. ``Pieces were falling
out from the ceiling and we've scraped a lot of water off the
floor. But I puttered along.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to an ambitious project being carried out by a
private, nonprofit development group, Coonin is preparing to
retire. His building is being bought as part of an estimated $70
million residential and retail restoration and redevelopment of a
six-block area a block north of the Christina River _ the city's
prime historic district.
</P>
<P>
   Historians say the plan by the Wilmington Renaissance Corp.
appears to be the first such single, major effort for residential
development in that area since Thomas Willling laid out plans for
the city in 1731. Willing developed a grid pattern of streets for
what was then called Willingtown, and sold lots. The first house,
dated 1732, was one block south of Coonin's shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really the gateway to Wilmington,'' said Martin
Berger, who owns Berger Bros. office-furniture store across the
street from Coonin, as well as seven more buildings in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The redevelopers have named the area the Ships Tavern District
in honor of an 18th-century watering hole mentioned by George
Washington in his diaries. Washington, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams
and Aaron Burr all stopped there.
</P>
<P>
   This is hardly the first redevelopment plan proposed for
downtown Wilmington, but the Ships Tavern project has been getting
a strong vote of confidence from residents, public officials and
private business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing is right,'' said Mr. Coonin. ``I don't think it
will ever be depressed again.''
</P>
<P>
   The optimism can also be attributed to the fact that the project
is being spearheaded by the Renaissance Corp., which since 1993 has
had a string of small successes in revitalizing the downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Supported by the city's biggest employers _ such as E.I. du Pont
de Nemours &AMP; Co. and MBNA America Bank _ Renaissance is thought to
have the kind of muscle necessary for success. Board members
include representatives of Du Pont, as well as the city's major
banks. Mayor James H. Sills Jr. and City Council President James M.
Baker are also board members.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys have the political and financial clout to pull it
off,'' said David J. Wilk, a real estate consultant.
</P>
<P>
   To oversee the project, Renaissance formed a separate
development arm headed by Joshua W. Martin III, chief executive of
Bell Atlantic Delaware. The development company reached an
agreement with the city to play a role in its center city urban
renewal plan. Under the contract, the group will have access to the
city's condemnation powers, a weapon against land speculators. The
city already controls 27 properties in or near the Ships Tavern
District.
</P>
<P>
   The redevelopment project, which comprises historic buildings
from Martin Luther King Boulevard to Fourth Street, will be done in
increments. The first phase of the development will focus on a row
of 18 buildings in the 200 block of North Market Street, chosen
because it features a strong inventory of buildings dating from the
19th century. This section, which could cost up to $20 million,
will be renovated as 80 apartments and 15 shops and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the buildings from the original Willingtown have
been lost, at least one structure with a brick Flemish-bond facade
could have been built as early as the late 18th century, said Eldon
du Pont Homsey, the architect on the project. The upper floors
retain such details as brownstone trim, decorative tiles and
cornices from the days when the area was a bustling commercial
district.
</P>
<P>
   Coonin's building once housed a jewelry maker. Coonin found that
out a few years ago when be bought a pocket watch from an old man
for the four ounces of gold it contained. When Coonin took the
watch apart he found an engraving noting that it was made by
``Charles F. Rudolph, 231 Market Street.'' The watch dates from
1875. ``I almost fell down,'' said Coonin, who now keeps the watch
tucked away in a safe.
</P>
<P>
   Historians say Jewish settlers were trading on the Delaware
River in nearby New Castle in the mid-17th century, and that one of
the earliest Jewish settlers in what is now Wilmington, in the
mid-18th century, was Abraham Judah, a merchant.
</P>
<P>
   In 1850, two brothers, Jacob and Daniel deSolis, began what grew
to be the city's first Jewish community when they opened a dry
goods store on Third Street.
</P>
<P>
   After 1880, the Jewish population increased with a wave of
immigrants from Russia, Austria and Poland. The Orthodox Adas
Kodesch congregation was formed several doors south of Mr. Coonin's
shop in 1889. By 1903, there were 800 Jewish immigrants in
Wilmington.
</P>
<P>
   Herman Cohen, 76, a partner in the 57-year-old Cohen Bros.
furniture store, said that in the '30s the area was like the ``East
Side of New York on a small scale.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These people had just come from Europe in the early 1900s _
they'd only been in the country 20 or 30 years,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   But about 40 years ago the area began to lose its vitality. Many
merchants say the decline was hastened by an 11-month occupation of
the city by the Delaware National Guard following race riots in
April 1968. Cohen moved his store outside the city in the 70s.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Coonin is cleaning out the shop he occupied for more than
30 years in anticipation of the start of construction. The initial
phase of the work will be done by Struever Bros., Eccles &AMP; Rouse of
Baltimore, a company that specializes in historic renovations.
Struever recently handled the $25 million conversion of the
American Can Co.building in Baltimore's Canton section into offices
and shops.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Renaissance Corp. does not intend to be a landowner,
it will hold options on properties, then turn them over to Struever
at the settlement table.
</P>
<P>
   Renaissance will work with Struever to arrange financing
packages that could include bank loans made under the 1977 Federal
Community Reinvestment Act, requiring banks to make low-interest
loans in communities where they take deposits, as well as funds
from the sale of tax credits for renovation of historic buildings
under a federal program that gives investors credits for a certain
percentage of restoration work that the investors can use to offset
income taxes, said William C. Wyer, managing director of the
Renaissance Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the plan also includes building a 1.8-mile trolley line
through the Ships Tavern District running from the new Riverfront
Arts Center on the Christina River to the Brandywine Creek to the
north as a way to tie the northern end of the city with the
development on the southern end.

This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; UNDER GEMINI: A MEMOIR &LR;  By Isabel Bolton. Steerforth, $12. The
author, whose novels were highly praised in the 1940s and '50s,
describes growing up as an orphan in turn-of-the-century
Massachusetts with her identical twin sister, who died in a
swimming accident at the age of 14. In 1966, in The New York Times
Book Review, Diana Trilling called this slender book an
``extraordinarily poignant memoir of her quite extraordinary
childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PRESTON FALLS &LR;  By David Gates. Vintage Contemporaries, $13. At
the center of this novel is a cynical, highly unlovable public
relations executive who takes a couple of months off to fix up his
family's getaway house in upstate New York. After a fight with his
wife lands him in jail, he hooks up with a lawyer who lures him
into cocaine trafficking. This scary tale of male vanity and the
dark underbelly of middle age was selected as one of the best books
of 1998 by the editors of The New York Times Book Review. ``You're
almost afraid to go back to the book once you've put it down,''
Michael Wood wrote last year. ``Anything could happen, and it's
likely to be horrible, irremediable.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ONE NATION, AFTER ALL. WHAT MIDDLE-CLASS AMERICANS REALLY THINK
ABOUT: GOD, COUNTRY, FAMILY, RACISM, WELFARE, IMMIGRATION,
HOMOSEXUALITY, WORK, THE RIGHT, THE LEFT, AND EACH OTHER &LR;  By Alan
Wolfe. Penguin, $13.95. Sifting through interviews with 200
middle-class folks of all stripes, a sociologist discovers far more
sympathy for civil rights, women's rights and religious diversity
than people often get credit for. This optimistic survey ``is a
fascinating and often stirring tour through an America that the
news media and would-be culture warriors seem not to know,'' Brent
Staples wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CIVILITY: MANNERS, MORALS, AND THE ETIQUETTE OF DEMOCRACY &LR;  By
Stephen L. Carter. Harper Perennial, $13. A law professor explores
the idea of civility (and incivility) from the evolution of
Euro-American etiquette to censorship in cyberspace, and urges a
more civil national discourse, especially where matters of faith
are concerned. ``His meditations on the tensions between democracy
and religion display ... eloquence and independence of mind,''
Michael Lind wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BIRTHDAY LETTERS &LR;  By Ted Hughes. Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $12.
The subject of these poems is Hughes' stormy relationship with
Sylvia Plath, and the result is an inevitably one-sided rebuke to
those who see him as the villain in Plath's 1963 suicide. Last year
the reviewer Katha Pollitt praised the ``emotional, direct,
regretful, entranced'' tone that ``pervades the book's strongest
poems, which are quiet and thoughtful and conversational.''
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has issued  &UR; TALES FROM OVID &LR;  ($14), in which
Hughes tackles the ironic, urbane Ovid of ancient Rome; somehow the
pairing clicks. ``The result is that rare thing _ an inspired act
of translation that stands as vigorous poetry in its own right,''
James Shapiro wrote in 1997. ``This book brilliantly succeeds at
bringing Ovid's passionate and disturbing stories to life.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BE SWEET: A CONDITIONAL LOVE STORY &LR;  By Roy Blount Jr.
Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $13. The humorist's unflinching account of
his Georgia childhood has everything to do with his mother, Louise,
a difficult woman whose mystery haunts her son into adulthood.
```Be Sweet' is both literary and down-home, a thinking man's thigh
slapper'' and ``a serious heartbreaker,'' Josephine Humphreys wrote
last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE LIFE OF INSECTS &LR;  By Victor Pelevin. Penguin, $11.95. The
human characters in this slippery Russian novel morph back and
forth into bugs _ chief among them are a trio of voracious
investors/mosquitoes and a sexy fly named Natasha. ``Political
allegory, antic fantasy, willful enigma: Victor Pelevin's latest
book ... is a little of all three,'' Michael Upchurch wrote in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A SHORT HISTORY OF BYZANTIUM &LR;  By John Julius Norwich. Vintage,
$17. This condensed version of the author's three-volume history
starts with the founding of Constantinople in 330 and its fall in
1453. ``Lord Norwich has sacrificed none of the virtues of the
longer work: lively narration and a taste for the eccentric
anecdote and revelatory detail,'' Michael Anderson wrote in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FROM THE HOLY MOUNTAIN: A JOURNEY AMONG THE CHRISTIANS OF THE
MIDDLE EAST &LR;  By William Dalrymple. Owl/Holt, $16.95. This retraces
the path of two monks who traveled in the Byzantine Empire in the
late sixth and early seventh centuries. ``Dalrymple is the
professor whose obscure lectures you attend just so you can hear
him talk,'' Ted Conover wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE ILLUSIONIST &LR;  By Dinitia Smith. Scribner, $12. This novel by
a reporter for The New York Times is about an androgynous man who
coasts into a rural New York town and the tragedy that results when
three lonely women are drawn into his web. The story's ``greatest
strength is the sensitivity with which Smith explores the
complexities of love,'' Edward Hower wrote in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SKIN DEEP &LR;  By Diana Wagman. University of Mississippi, $15. A
former topless waitress enters a peculiar relationship with a young
doctor who pays her well to shroud herself completely in blue and
talk about beauty. In 1997 the reviewer Courtney Weaver called this
``a curious and disturbing'' first novel.

KEATING: FINANCIER'S MYTH FINALLY SHATTERED  
 (ANALYSIS)

<TEXT>
<P>
   In early 1989, just before Charles H Keating Jr. took American
Continental Corp. into bankruptcy, he ordered a series of illegal
raids on the corporate coffers.
</P>
<P>
   Keating, who once towered over Arizona business and politics
like a colossus, admitted it publicly last week.
</P>
<P>
   In an agreement with federal prosecutors, he acknowledged
concocting phony loans to siphon $975,000 out of ACC, the
Phoenix-based corporation where he was CEO.
</P>
<P>
   With that plea bargain, Keating shattered his own myth, the
long-running legend of himself as a high-flying financial
visionary, bold entrepreneur and crusader against meddling
government regulators and other infidels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like a knight on a white charger,'' Keating once declared.
</P>
<P>
   He also ended a major chapter in America's savings-and-loan
scandal, the saga of greed, deceit and insider dealing that
consumed billions of dollars through fraud and incompetence and
left broad political wounds that have yet to heal.
</P>
<P>
   Keating would not comment on the case this week. But his lawyer
said the 75-year-old man took the plea to avoid the risk of another
trial, which could have sent him back to prison. Recent family
tragedy may have weighed in his decision; the plea comes eight
weeks after the sudden death of a daughter.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Until last week, the 6-foot-5-inch Keating, a former champion
swimmer who built his first national reputation as a 1970s
pornography fighter, defiantly claimed that he was the innocent
victim of regulators' abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Keating derided regulators as ``scum.'' He saw them as petty,
rule-obsessed bureaucrats incapable of appreciating the
entrepreneurial genius he brought to the formerly staid savings and
loan industry.
</P>
<P>
   Tall and prickly as a saguaro, with a volcanic temper, Keating
heaped scorn on regulators who sought to restrain his use of
billions of dollars in federally insured deposits at Lincoln
Savings. The Southern California thrift, ACC's principal
subsidiary, was the centerpiece of his financial empire.
</P>
<P>
   The plaque on his desk proclaimed his combative creed: ``A man
can do no wrong if he always rides to the sound of the guns.''
</P>
<P>
   For the 62 months that he owned Lincoln, Keating used other
people's money to bankroll his corporate Camelot on Camelback Road.
</P>
<P>
   He donated lavishly to Mother Teresa, bought a luxury Miami home
as an ``office'' and jetted off to gambling sprees in Monaco. He
commanded a three-jet corporate fleet that flew him around the
world and carried Sen. John McCain and other luminaries to his
luxurious retreat in the Bahamas. Its cost for four years: $31
million.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Keating myth, he built a sleek, smooth-running
financial engine powered by his entrepreneurial genius, his
unerring instinct for the deal.
</P>
<P>
   But after ACC's bankruptcy, Keating's critics branded him as a
savings and loan pirate in a Hermes tie, the archvillain of the
national S&AMP;L debacle, and predatory pusher of junk bonds to mostly
elderly investors.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Keating was convicted in a California court of
defrauding bondholders. The verdict was overturned due to judicial
error, but prosecutors are seeking to have it restored.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 he was convicted in federal court on 73 felony counts.
He served 50 months in prison before that verdict was overturned
because of jury misconduct. He was heading toward a new trial until
last week's plea bargain _ in which he was sentenced to time served
_ settled his federal account.
</P>
<P>
   After his state conviction, Keating issued a a typically
thunderous declaration of innocence. He claimed he was made a
scapegoat for the S&AMP;L scandal by a ``vicious and vindictive group
of bureaucrats and sinister politicians hoping to cover their
perfidy and ignorance by pillorying Charlie Keating.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the core of his myth: Keating as martyr to the cause of
freeing Lincoln from bureaucratic bondage.
</P>
<P>
   Keating spent freely to advance his cause. After he took ACC
into bankruptcy and regulators seized Lincoln, he talked about his
shopping spree for political influence, noting that questions had
been raised about ``whether my financial support in any way
influenced several political figures to take up my cause.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say in the most forceful way I can: I certainly hope
so.''
</P>
<P>
   That blunt manifesto would echo throughout the Senate ethics
hearings on the men _ including then-Arizona Sen. Dennis DeConcini
and Sen. John McCain _ who would be dubbed the Keating Five for
intervening with federal regulators on Keating's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1987 meeting with the senators, regulators told of
Keating's recklessness: multimillion-dollar loans made without
basic checks of the borrower's ability to repay, wacky appraisals
of real estate, wholesale violation of regulatory guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Regulator Mike Patriarca said what it all meant for Keating's
self-professed visionaries: ``They're flying blind on all their
different loans and investments.''
</P>
<P>
   They were also flying high. In mid-1988, when American
Continental was nearing collapse and had little income except from
junk bond sales, two of Keating's planes took 21 members of the
Keating family on a three-week tour of Europe. There were luxury
hotel stays in Italy, Switzerland, Yugoslavia, Germany, France,
England and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Keating recorded the trip as a business expense. After all, he
reasoned, it included interviews with chefs for possible employment
at the Phoenician resort, his prize property that opened that fall.
He also studied the hotels' management techniques.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Keating threw the annual corporate Christmas party at
the Registry Resort in Scottsdale. The entertainment, featuring the
Peter Duchin Orchestra from New York, cost $27,143. ACC paid
$65,319 for food and drinks; $2,449 for Christmas trees; and $1,948
for Silly String.
</P>
<P>
   Such extravagance was part of Keating's illusion of prosperity,
which also included glowing annual reports that attracted thousands
of investors to ACC's bonds. The major accounting firms that put
their professional blessing on Keating's bottom line would later
pay $93 million to settle the investors' lawsuit. Keating's law
firms paid $55 million more.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Keating made a money-eating machine out of Lincoln,
which he had bought in 1984 for $52 million raised by junk bonds
issued by Michael Milken.
</P>
<P>
   Milken had been one of the first to recognize the opportunities
Congress provided in 1982 by curtailing federal regulation. Urged
on by the S&AMP;L lobby, Congress acted to revitalize an industry that
had always been limited to financing the American dream with home
mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate result of deregulation was that many thrifts were
transformed from wallflowers of investment to high rollers that
played every game in the high-finance casino: high-risk real
estate, foreign currency futures, investments in restaurants and
hotels, and Milken's junk bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker called it ``kamikaze banking.''
But backers of deregulation promised it would liberate the genius
of American entrepreneurship, getting regulators off the backs of
inspired men who knew how to make the economy hum.
</P>
<P>
   This brave new world was irresistible to developers like
Keating. They had spent their careers using their own money to fund
housing projects and shopping centers. Keating excelled at it,
building such developments as Dobson Ranch and the Islands in
Gilbert.
</P>
<P>
   But building houses was boring compared with the thrill of
sitting at the controls of a savings and loan. S&AMP;L owners had
billions of dollars of deposits to fuel their speculative dreams,
backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   The formula was foolproof: Profits went to the S&AMP;L owners; if
they failed, taxpayers would pick up the tab. It was a system that,
in the words of one congressman, ``privatized gain and socialized
loss.''
</P>
<P>
   And what losses! Regulators say Lincoln's failure cost taxpayers
$3.4 billion. This means that, on average, Keating lost about $1.8
million every day of the five-plus years he ran Lincoln. That's
$75,000 every hour, every day.
</P>
<P>
   Keating lived the regal life to which he felt he was entitled.
Luxury homes in Miami and the Bahamas, a fleet of luxury cars,
lavish salaries and bonuses for himself and his inner circle,
fistfuls of $50 bills handed to secretaries for shopping sprees,
handfuls of $100 bills tossed into the air at a pep rally for
swooning bond sellers shortly before bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988 he took $3 million out of ACC for himself in salaries
and bonuses. At one point, six of the 10 highest-paid executives in
Arizona were on his payroll. He displayed his largesse on national
television, spontaneously telling a secretary he was raising her
salary to $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   One of the highest-paid ACC executives was Keating's right-hand
woman, ACC President Judy Wischer. It was Wischer who inadvertently
gave the public a glimpse into the cult quality of American
Continental, where absolute, unquestioning loyalty to Keating was
an article of corporate faith.
</P>
<P>
   Wischer told of a ritual ACC passage up the corporate ladder.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to bring someone, especially a woman, out of the
minor leagues when they have just been promoted, we let them fire
somebody,'' she said in a 1988 speech. ``Suddenly, they know
they're not playing by the same rules anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, testifying as the star witness in Keating's
federal trial, Wischer told how Keating concocted bogus land sales
to show a profit on his books.
</P>
<P>
   On the last day of the third quarter in 1986, she said, he
pretended to make a $25 million sale of a portion of Continental
Ranch near Tucson to a Phoenix home builder, R.A. Homes.
</P>
<P>
   Keating drew R.A. Homes into the deal by promising that when he
found a legitimate buyer, he would pay the company the first $2.5
million in profits and split additional profits with it, Wischer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Keating used that deal, plus another sham transaction on land in
La Paz County to avoid showing a quarterly loss. Instead he told
the world he had turned an $8 million profit.
</P>
<P>
   There were dozens of such bogus deals. But last week's plea deal
means he won't have to confront charges stemming from them. Nor
will a federal jury hear testimony from ACC bondholders seduced and
devastated by Keating's grand illusion.
</P>
<P>
   The bondholders have now recovered most of their money, through
lawsuits against Keating's accountants, lawyers and other
associates. Keating has been ordered to pay $3 billion for his
fraud. He hasn't paid a dime. He claims he is broke.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the bondholders, Keating's victims also include
the 10 insiders and business associates convicted of various
charges, the politicians, accountants, lawyers and appraisers whose
reputations were sullied, the American taxpayers who picked up the
tab and became more cynical about their government.
</P>
<P>
   But the plea deal is a way of signaling an end to the Keating
trauma. It not only relieves Keating from the dangers of a new
trial. It also spares prosecutors the burden of presenting a
complicated case with old evidence.
</P>
<P>
   With many of the criminal counts wiped out, Keating may cling to
the tattered remnants of his myth. He may proclaim that he wasn't
convicted for the land deals or bond sales that were the core of
the federal case. He may try to present his last raid on the
corporate treasury as an inconsequential footnote.
</P>
<P>
   But the history is in the books.
</P>
<P>
   Rep Jim Leach, R-Iowa, labeled Keating in 1989 ``a financiopath
of obscene proportions, the Rev. Jim Bakker of American commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal Judge Stanley Sporkin said in 1990 that Keating had
conducted a sophisticated ``looting of Lincoln.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week Ron Warnicke, the bankruptcy examiner who was one of
the first to report on Keating's fraud, drew a final lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arrogance in the handling of other people's money,'' he said,
``is a certain path to financial ruin.'' &QL;
