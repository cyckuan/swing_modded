FORWARD-LOOKING PIAZZA TAKES A GLANCE BACK

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mike Piazza didn't play Thursday, but the crush for
post-game interviews around his locker had a World Series feel to
it.
</P>
<P>
   That much hasn't changed.
</P>
<P>
   Neither has his old team 3,000 miles away, still bloated, still
sloshing around .500, still telling anyone who will listen that
there is a half-season left to play.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza used to take the heat for the Dodgers' indifference, the
one thing the .338 lifetime hitter had to answer for over and over
again. Now he's gone and that indifference continues to rage.
</P>
<P>
   But Piazza takes no joy in knowing the problem stayed after he
left. Thirteen months after joining the New York Mets, he still
knows he was the best player on a team expected to do much more.
All Piazza can do is move on and hope people understand that it
takes 25 guys to make a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about playing in New York is that it lets you turn
the page on everything,'' he said after missing the first of two
games with a slight concussion. ``Maybe if I was somewhere else,
somewhere smaller, I'd wonder. It's clear you can't just throw
money at a problem. You have to get the right players who will play
as a unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what has happened here. For me, there is not much
looking back.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean others haven't looked back for him.
</P>
<P>
   Mets manager Bobby Valentine, who nearly lost his job two weeks
ago when a player mutiny led to an eight-game losing streak, knows
what Piazza means to his team. Since the failed coup, the Mets have
won 13 of 17, including Friday's 10-2 rout of Atlanta that moved
them within two games of the Braves in the National League East.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, who turns 31 in September, was in the midst of a 24-game
hitting streak during that span, although Valentine said, ``he
wasn't that ferocious, dominant hitter he was with the Dodgers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He got his hits, but you didn't see that terror everyone came
to expect in L.A.,'' Valentine said of Piazza, who batted .211 with
runners in scoring position during the streak. ``But that was
almost a good thing because others stepped up. That's what winning
is all about. It's not one guy carrying the load.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine admitted that Piazza's quiet nature was puzzling to
his new team after the trade and into this year. He said that
changed when Piazza hit a ninth-inning, game-winning home run April
28 off San Diego closer Trevor Hoffman. Piazza pumped his fist
circling the bases and later in the clubhouse. His rare display of
emotion bubbled over to teammates who realized he could be one of
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike opened up that day,'' Valentine said. ``He laughed a lot
and suddenly became more approachable. Guys felt they could kid
with him and I don't think that had happened anywhere before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does he feel vindicated about the situation (in L.A.)? I think
it is too soon to tell. Maybe a little, but that is something you
think about after a career, when you wonder about the decisions you
made in your life.''
</P>
<P>
   Orel Hershiser, a Dodger early in Piazza's career, says the
catcher is far different than L.A. fans remember. Although Piazza
signed a seven-year, $91 million contract last winter, he appears
more relaxed than ever. Hershiser says the presence of solid
veterans like Robin Ventura, Rickey Henderson and John Franco have
removed the pressure from Piazza of setting the team's tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always seemed like out there he was searching for who he
was,'' Hershiser said. ``That's pretty common for a young player.
But now he knows who he is. A Hall of Fame catcher who can carry a
team with his bat, who doesn't always let a lot of people in. It's
hard to be one of the guys when you're that great, but he has fit
in here.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the guys, Bobby Bonilla, was part of the seven-player
trade that sent Piazza from the Dodgers to Florida last May. They
never played together, but he says it's easy to understand the
change in Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   ``This might sound like a baseball thing, but when you're a
catcher in L.A. the travel absolutely kills you,'' he said. ``Last
year I remember (Charles Johnson) saying how the travel made him
wonder if he could play here. Except for the West, every flight is
four hours. Here, everybody is close, Philadelphia, Montreal,
Pittsburgh. That's doable. For a guy catching 140 games a year and
asked to carry the team, that was not possible. Not even for Mike
Piazza.'' &QL;

EX-MOB LAWYER RIDES TO POWER ON NEIGBORHOOD-FOCUSED CAMPAIGN
</HEADLINE>
 VEGAS-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By SHAUN MCKINNON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ The Bagel Cafe sits in a small office park miles
from the slot machines and gaming tables of the famous Strip, on
the edge of a sprawling master-planned community so full of stucco,
tile roofs and cul-de-sacs it can barely contain its typical
suburbanness.
</P>
<P>
   This is the new Las Vegas. Sin City gone legit. Not a showgirl
or a buffet line in sight. Except for a couple of video poker
machines in the corner 7-Eleven, it could be Mesa. And it is to
this Chamber of Commerce postcard one recent Sun day morning that
defense attorney Oscar Goodman, a man who built his career
representing the accused murderers, money launderers and organized
crime bosses of Old Vegas, came to buy bagels.
</P>
<P>
   He was spotted at once and within moments, he was, pardon the
terminology, mobbed by diners who wanted to shake the hand of this
improbable new civic hero, this throwback to a nearly buried past
who defied the city's political ma chine earlier this month and got
himself elected mayor in a land slide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, Mr. Goodman,'' one woman said, waving from a table
by the window.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give 'em hell, Oscar!'' yelled a man from across the room.
Good man grinned, reveling in the atten tion.
</P>
<P>
   To anyone outside Nevada, the idea that a millionaire lawyer who
works for reputed mobsters could be elected mayor of Las Vegas
isn't so far out, probably even makes sense. But to image-conscious
business and tourism leaders who want desperately to reinvent this
desert gambling town as a sophisticated international resort
destination, Goodman was poison, a source of potentially disastrous
publicity they wanted to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   What they didn't count on was a candidate adept at reinventing
him self and an electorate willing to give him a shot.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman drilled to the core with issues that hit closer to home
than attracting new visitors to fill the ever-expanding number of
Strip hotel rooms. His campaign focused on rebuilding
neighborhoods, fixing clogged roads and freeways, and forcing
developers to pay a bigger share for the infrastructure needs
created by more than a decade of phenomenal growth _ issues that
could have been lifted from a mayoral race in Phoenix or Glen dale.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talked about quality of life and standard of living when
most of the time politicians talk about gam ing, hotels and
tourism,'' said Rob ert Parker, a professor of sociology at the
University of Nevada at Las Vegas. ``People have become much more
sensitive to the underside of growth the past few years. He has an
opportunity to do some good for the city.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Goodman wants to hear, what he needs to hear. He
entered the race for mayor, he said, because he wanted to give some
thing back to a city he loves.
</P>
<P>
   He certainly didn't do it for the money. He's a millionaire many
times over and will earn $48,000 a year as mayor. His power will be
limited. Las Vegas operates under a city manager form of
government, and the mayor is just one of five votes on the City
Council. For ego? Hardly. Around Las Vegas, Good man is better
known in most circles than the governor, and he definitely has a
better chance of getting a good table than the state's chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a true believer,'' fellow attorney and former City
Council man Matthew Callister said. ``He's a look-you-in-the-eye
kind of guy who says, `The community's been good to me, now here's
what I want to do for the community.' I think he'll have a lot of
frustrations early on, but I think he really intends to make it a
cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Had the pundits held sway, Oscar Goodman would not be taking the
oath of office Monday morning. He was dismissed from the start as
unelectable because of his political inexperience, because of a
strong slate of other candidates, but mostly because of his past,
his tendency to represent, in his own words, tough guys whose names
end in vowels.
</P>
<P>
   Days after he declared his candi dacy, the state's largest daily
news paper, the Las Vegas Review-Journal, ran an editorial early in
the race with the headline, ``Anybody but Oscar,'' branding him a
``barrister to butchers.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that the newspaper, or anyone else for that matter,
worried that Goodman's election would usher in a new day for the
mob, whose influence along the Strip was pushed aside during the
1990s by the arrival of huge, publicly traded gaming corporations.
</P>
<P>
   No, it was mostly the image thing _ ``Oscar Goodman carries so
much baggage he could be Sky Cap of the Century at McCarran Interna
tional Airport,'' the newspaper wrote, ``and as the most visible
personification of the `new' Las Vegas, he'd be a PR catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   Worried about his populist cam paign, some business and gaming
leaders began to beat the drum on the image issue, first
whispering, then going on record in national newsmagazines and on
television that electing a former mob mouth piece mayor would be
bad for Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there he is, ``Oscar Mayor Winner,'' as one newspaper trum
peted the morning after a victory so convincing _ Goodman garnered
64 percent of the vote _ some observers now say it may have been
backlash against such a well-organ ized attempt by the
establishment to discredit the so-called mob lawyer and avoid the
embarrassment of a mob mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public is very excited about Oscar Goodman being mayor,''
the 59-year-old Goodman said in an interview last week. ``The
planes haven't stopped flying in and the cars aren't stopping at
the border. The media stories are turn ing around; and now, instead
of the past, they're talking about the fu ture. And that's what my
tenure is going to be about.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman has lived at the top of the world since June 8.
President Clinton called to congratulate him. Al Gore called to
wish him the best. Everywhere he goes, people wave and want to
shake his hand. He laughs, remembering the little old ladies who
raced after him one morning as he walked down Fre mont Street, in
the city's downtown casino district. He can't go any where, he
said, without drawing crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no place like Las Vegas,'' he said. ``Las Vegas is
special. There's an electricity here you don't find anywhere else.
And I think I bring a little mystique because of my background.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes, his background. A brief synopsis, then: Born and reared
in Philadelphia, Goodman with his wife, Carolyn, trekked west 35
years ago and settled in Las Vegas, where he almost stumbled into
his first job representing a person accused of being a mob figure.
</P>
<P>
   He won the case and many more after that, and he soon found
himself in courtrooms side by side with ``bad guys'' like Meyer Lan
sky, the mob's money man; Joey Cusumano; Charlie ``The Moose''
Panarella; Frank ``Lefty'' Rosen thal; and Tony ``The Ant''
Spilotro, the Chicago mob's Las Vegas en forcer during the 1970s
and '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman apologizes for nothing in his past, resents even any
ques tions about it. People accused of crimes deserve a good
attorney, he said, and by standing up for the constitutional rights
of these tough guys, he's standing up for the Constitution itself.
</P>
<P>
   He stayed in business and out of prison by knowing what he
needed to. He would never acknowledge his clients' alleged mob
ties, even proclaimed straight-faced for years that he knew of no
Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   Spilotro, whose life was fictional ized in the Martin Scorsese
film Casino, was accused once of stick ing a man's head in a vise
and twisting so hard the man's skull cracked and his eyes popped
out. Did it happen? Spilotro was acquit ted, said Goodman, who
played himself opposite Joe Pesci in the movie. That's what was
important.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Goodman landed in the newspapers and on
television frequently, aghast each time a client was indicted anew,
ready to chase away government prosecutors. Spi lotro was suspected
in 22 killings and charged with a laundry list of other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   He stayed out of prison thanks to Goodman, until 1986, when he
and his brother were found beaten to death in an Indiana cornfield,
appar ent victims of a mob hit.
</P>
<P>
   All of that was common knowl edge in Las Vegas. But for the
thousands of newcomers, Good man's opponents dredged much of it up
for a series of TV advertise ments. Still, voters looked the other
way, telling one pollster Goodman's past didn't make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Callister, the former councilman, offers several theories. For
one thing, Goodman brings to the job a certain brashness and
ability to deliver a message that Las Vegas voters became
accustomed to under two-term Mayor Jan Laverty Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was elected in 1991 with no political experience but with
the notoriety of her appearances in TV spots for her family's car
dealer ships. In one ad the people of Las Vegas still talk about,
Jones ca vorted with female impersonator Kenny Kerr, a Strip
regular who played the future mayor's evil sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's natural for people to want some glitz in their
politicians, some glamour, some flash,'' Callister said. ``This is
Vegas, after all. I used to tell people to celebrate their
Vegas-ness. This isn't like any other town.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker, the UNLV sociologist, buys into that, in part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some people are very happy and proud to live here,''
he said. ``They relish the imagery, and Oscar looks like Las Vegas,
he acts like Las Vegas.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many residents also may be worried about the
negative effects not only of growth _ the traffic, the polluted air
_ but of the city's rise to international prominence, appealing to
the elite travelers with five-star restaurants and exclusive
boutiques.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's becoming almost unafford able for locals,'' Parker said.
``There's a growing division be tween the haves and have-nots.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman, Parker theorizes, seems to recognize that and offers
himself as an advocate for the people, another odd contrast consid
ering his wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who was one of the region's first elected officials to
advocate growth management, said no one should overlook the impor
tance of neighborhood issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone gets caught up in Las Vegas as being part of
the Number One resort destination in the country,'' she said.
``That doesn't mean people who live here don't have concerns about
their neighborhoods. If Las Vegas is going to continue to grow, it
has to put all of its energy into city issues, in building a real
city that puts the quality of life of its residents as its
priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how much Goodman can accomplish remains part of the debate,
as does much of his specific list of ideas. He promised to work for
impact fees, something that developers have successfully avoided
for years and that would require action by the state Legisla ture.
He has pledged to bring new housing and businesses to older
neighborhoods, proposing that de velopers who want to build in the
city's growing outer edges first commit to in-fill projects.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he saw no reason Las Vegas, which barely supports a
Triple-A baseball team, shouldn't get an NFL franchise. He wants
more high-tech jobs and promised to get Microsoft chief Bill Gates
on the phone his first week or two in office to try to strike a
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a passion for the community,'' said Kara Kelley, sen
ior vice president of the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce. ``He's en
gaging and, hopefully, he will be able to help people appreciate
what a wonderful place this is. But in the business community, we
have a lot of bigger issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``For any company seriously con sidering relocating here, the
mayor isn't going to be a factor in the decision. We have life
beyond the Strip. I think there's a tendency to underestimate the
quality of life here.''
</P>
<P>
   Even then, there's only so much Las Vegas can do to overcome its
deeper image problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're never going to be a cultural mecca for a Bostonian,''
Kelley said. ``But we're living in a major metropolitan area, and
we've created a community. People who call this home love it for
what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman's greatest reality check may come when he tries to push
one of his grander ideas and needs the help of other government
entities _ and he will. Of the 1.3 million people who live in Clark
County, barely one-third live in the city of Las Vegas and the
revenue-generat ing Strip resorts all lie in the unincorporated
county.
</P>
<P>
   The county and the neighboring Henderson, with nearly 200,000
residents _ the fastest-growing city in the valley _ have proved
far less amiable to growth-control measures and far more likely to
encourage new development as long as the demand continues.
</P>
<P>
   In a crunch, the true depth of Goodman's support may become a
factor as well. Although he was elected by a huge margin, turnout
overall was miserably low and Goodman took home fewer than 37,000
votes in a city of more than 400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman is undeterred. He will begin, he said, by revitalizing
down town, which now is a sometimes uncomfortable grouping of older
casinos, government buildings and rows of aging motels and wedding
chapels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make downtown the same kind of glittering beacon as
we have on the Strip,'' Goodman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to get private enter prise involved. We're going to
bring in bookstores and coffeehouses and movie theaters.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman plans to devote himself full time to the job, leaving
his law practice behind, a painful, he said, but necessary step if
he is to accomplish his goals. He attended his first-ever City
Council meeting a week after he was elected and has stayed up
nights studying Robert's Rules of Order.
</P>
<P>
   And for good measure, just in case anyone thinks he's forgotten
how to celebrate his Vegas-ness, Goodman attended a party last
weekend with an old pal and Casino co-star, actor Robert De Niro,
who is opening a restaurant in town.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman chuckles at the thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a colorful life and I've met a lot of colorful
people,'' he said. ``And if I had to do it all over again, I
wouldn't change a day.'' &QL;

COYOTES DEAL TVERDOVSKY TO GET MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ About 15 minutes before the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim
were scheduled to make their first-round selection in Saturday's
NHL entry draft with the 15th overall pick, General Manager Pierre
Gauthier received a call from his counterpart from Phoenix, Bobby
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   What would it take, the Coyotes GM asked, for the Ducks to part
with the pick?
</P>
<P>
   Smith and the Coyotes desperately wanted to grab Seattle
Thunderbirds center Scott Kelman but weren't sure they'd be able to
nab him at No. 19. Gauthier thought about it, and said he would
send the 15th choice, along with 28-year-old center Travis Green,
if the Coyotes were willing to part with talented defenseman Oleg
Tverdovsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was about a 12-second pause,'' Gauthier said, ``and then
Bobby said, `It's a deal' and hung up the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   And with that, the Coyotes made some noise of their own on an
eventful NHL draft day at the FleetCenter that produced plenty of
surprises and more than enough trades.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to trading Tverdovsky, the Coyotes also sent veteran
enforcer Jim Cummins to Montreal for a sixth-round pick,
jettisoning the $666,000 it would have cost to re-sign him. And,
they nearly pulled off a deal with the Atlanta Thrashers for
defenseman Jamie Pushor, acquired a day earlier in the NHL
expansion draft from Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   That deal, for a second- or third-round pick next year, could
still be in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, rumors of a possible trade involving center Jeremy
Roenick going to Detroit for left wing Brendan Shanahan were
quickly shot down by Smith, although where there is smoke, there
usually is fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not once mentioned Roenick's name to (Red Wings General
Manager ) Ken Holland,'' Smith said flatly.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes got their man in Kelman, 6-foot-2, 185 pounds, who
entered the draft as the sixth highest-rated North American
prospect, according to final rankings released by the Central
Scouting Bureau. The 18-year-old from Winnipeg scored only 19 goals
last season in the Western Hockey League, but scouts like his
play-making abilities, as his 54 assists would attest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of all the teams I could have gone to, Phoenix is the one I
really hoped would draft me,'' said Kelman, who grew up an avid
fans of the franchise when it was known as the Winnipeg Jets. ``I
know they traded a great young player in Oleg to get me, and I
guess that means they wanted me as much as I wanted them to pick
me.''
</P>
<P>
   With their original first-round pick, No. 19, the Coyotes went
with Russian defenseman Kiril Safronov, 6-foot-2, 196 pounds, who
was the sixth-highest rated European in the draft but is seen by
many scouts as perhaps the best overall defenseman of the entire
class.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough decision (trading Tverdovsky), but we feel like
Kelman's going to be a guy who's going to be with us for a long
time at center and there's a premium on centers right now,'' Smith
said. ``To get a guy like Travis Green, who's 215 pounds and can
play the position, is really going to help our team. He's a guy who
can play in the No. 2 spot behind Roenick, if we decide to put him
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Tverdovsky, meanwhile, returns to his former team, which made
him the second overall selection in the 1994 draft. An All-Star
three seasons ago during his first year in Phoenix when he scored
55 points, Tverdovsky has suffered back-to-back disappointing
seasons. A contract dispute limited him to just 46 games in
1997-98, when he scored 7 goals and 19 points, and last season,
despite appearing in all 82 games, he finished with just seven
goals and 25 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oleg's last couple years have not been great, but he's still a
player with a world of potential,'' Smith said. ``They don't come
along every day, but we feel like we got good value for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Moscow-born Tverdovsky was in Russia and could not
immediately be reached to be informed of his trade back to the
Ducks. He initially was dealt, along with center Chad Kilger, as
the two key components of the Teemu Selanne trade on Feb. 7, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's probably beneficial for everyone concerned,''
said Meehan, who ironically, represents all three players involved
in the deal. ``Phoenix ended up getting some help where they think
they need some help and given what transpired last year, some of
the factors which led to this trade, I know Oleg will look forward
to this as being a positive step.''
</P>
<P>
   Green, a seven-year pro who spent his first six years in the NHL
with the New York Islanders, was caught off guard by the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds exciting. I know they've got some skilled, gritty
forwards and good people and I'm looking forward to going there,''
said Green, who twice scored 20 or more goals in New York, but was
limited to 13 goals and 30 points last season with the Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Green has one more year left on his contract at $1.8 million.
Tverdovsky, a restricted free agent, earned $1.7 last season.

   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The chronic fatigue, the knee surgeries (12
and counting), the concussions, the fractured cheekbone, and the
knocked-out teeth are an old, old story. It's all in the Bible,
Michelle Akers will tell you.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was Job and lots of other dudes in there that God
squashed,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   He has his reasons, then and now, and after the illness and
injuries just kept on coming, Akers finally concluded that it was
some sort of biblical test.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent a lot of time asking God, `What's up here?' '' she
says. `` `What do you want me to do?' ''
</P>
<P>
   And the answer, she says, is always the same. Stop asking and
keep playing.
</P>
<P>
   Akers, at 33, is the alpha female on the US women's soccer team.
She has played 143 matches and scored 103 goals across 14 years.
She scored the first goal in the history of the program. She was
wearing a star-spangled jersey when Mia Hamm was a high-school
freshman. She has competed in three World Cups and one Olympics,
and she has played the last eight years while fighting off a
variety of physical torments.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Akers is still the mainspring of the world's best team,
the woman her teammates look to for direction on the field and
inspiration off it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her presence is such a contagious thing,'' says US coach Tony
DiCicco. ``When she steps on the soccer field, they look for
Michelle Akers.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Akers who won the 1991 Cup virtually by herself, scoring
10 goals in six matches, including the winner in the final with
Norway. When she went down with head and knee injuries in the 1995
opener, the US essentially went down with her, losing in the
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the same without her,'' says Hamm. ``There's that
feeling we have when she's out there. Every time Michelle gets
knocked down, everyone's silent. We just hope she gets back up.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamm may be the world's best player, but the Americans can't
reclaim the Cup without Akers, and they know it. So they're happy
to work around the chronic fatigue syndrome that still sucks her
dry and limits her availability not just from game to game but from
minute to minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really know,'' Akers shrugs. ``It's a bit
unpredictable. Sometimes it's 90 minutes, sometimes it's 20.''
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes it's none at all. Akers never knows until she
steps on the field for her warmup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I'll tell Tony that I can go or that I'm at half-mast or
that I need to step off,'' she says. Sometimes, she won't know
until she's played the better part of a half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to go to the edge and see what's there,'' Akers says.
``Sometimes, I'll get a second wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Akers is the constant variable on a team whose starting 11 is so
stable, so chock-a-block with 100-cap veterans, that it might as
well be engraved on a marble tablet. DiCicco always keeps a With
Michelle and Without Michelle lineup in his head.
</P>
<P>
   With is always better, he says, but we're always ready for
Without, and her teammates understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want her to come out and give what she's got,'' says
Tiffeny Milbrett, who has played alongside Akers since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   So far in this Cup, Akers has been able to give more than they
had dared to hope. She played all 90 minutes at defensive midfield
in the opener against Denmark and played the first half (and scored
a goal) in Thursday's 7-1 giggler against Nigeria before DiCicco
pulled her out and sent her in to rest and rehydrate.
</P>
<P>
   And unless they need her to settle or spark the team Sunday
night against the North Koreans in Foxboro Stadium, odds are Akers
will sit out to refill her tank for the quarterfinals and
semifinals (with a West Coast trip in between) at the end of the
week.
</P>
<P>
   She plays it game by game now. That's ironic, Akers says,
because that's how she trashed her body in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a kid, I played for the day and the moment,'' she says.
``That was my strength and my weakness. I played so much for the
moment that I got injured. I took a lot of physical risks because I
couldn't see beyond the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   She ruined both knees. She cracked skulls with defenders so
often going up for headers that concussions were common as bruises.
But Akers came to dominate her sport and put the women's game on
the global map. She was on top of the world in 1991 _ and then her
body turned on her.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows how Akers developed chronic fatigue syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still trying to figure out what it is,'' she says.
``Environment or genetics or a virus . . . they don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   All Akers knew was that suddenly, she couldn't play, couldn't
run, couldn't even take a five-minute walk. She had no energy. She
had harrowing migraines. She was sweating through three T-shirts a
night. Combine the flu with jet lag and multiply it, Akers says.
That's what chronic fatigue was, and still is, like for her.
</P>
<P>
   There were days when she felt so sick she wanted to go to sleep
and never wake up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't go on,'' Akers told herself before the 1996 Olympics,
but she gutted it through, won her gold medal, and spent the night
hooked up to an IV fluid bag while her teammates were out partying.
</P>
<P>
   Akers didn't play for more than a year after that, while she
tried to figure out whether it was worth the torment to continue.
She had tried alternative medicine. She had tried a zillion diets.
She wolfed down Power Bars by the fistful. Finally, Akers concluded
that it wasn't about anything she was or wasn't doing _ and it
wasn't merely a bum break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't thinking, `Why me, why me, poor Michelle,' '' she
says. ``It was more, `What does this mean? How do you want me to
change?' That's the question I would shout at God.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe all He wants you to do, Akers finally told herself, is
persevere and, perhaps, inspire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember once when we lost during the 1995 World Cup when I
was hurt,'' she says. ``And Carla Overbeck said: When we feel like
we want to quit, let's look at Michelle and how hard she's
fighting. I just started crying. That made it worthwhile, that my
struggles weren't going unnoticed.''
</P>
<P>
   The struggles go on. In February, Akers smacked heads with
Norway's Linda Medalen in the FIFA all-star game and broke three
bones below her left eye and took 25 stitches above.
</P>
<P>
   ``God's doing some big-time stuff in my life,'' she says. ``He's
squashing me, but at the same time he's building me up.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all in the Bible, she says. God uses people for his own
purposes, and maybe that's why he's picked Michelle Akers for this
challenge. Because Job was never much on headers.

NBA'S TEENAGE WASTELAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - When Rhode Island's Lamar Odom missed a couple of
workouts, fired his agent and found himself torn between remaining
in the NBA draft or trying to return to college, the red flags
began popping up.
</P>
<P>
   Does Odom have something to hide? Is he stable? Did he get bad
advice?
</P>
<P>
   Or is he just a confused 19-year-old kid unsure about making
decisions that are going to have an impact on the rest of his life
and career?
</P>
<P>
   It's a question the NBA has to answer for Odom and hundreds of
players like him, who are pushed by street agents, coerced by club
coaches and prodded by hangers-on to go on to the professional
level before finishing college _ or even starting it.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, the faces get younger. Odom is 19. Jonathan Bender, a
talented 18-year-old from Picayune High in New Orleans also is
expected to be taken high in Wednesday's NBA draft. Of the top
picks, only a few have played four years of college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressures that surround these kids, the temptations
they're faced with _ it's a horror story, and everyone knows it,''
said Dick Percudani, the Suns' director of college scouting.
</P>
<P>
   Some, such as Kevin Garnett and Kobe Bryant in recent years or
Moses Malone 25 years ago, can make the leap and succeed. Others,
such as Magic Johnson, Isiah Thomas and Michael Jordan, have made
the transition smoothly with one or two years of collegiate
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can count those on one hand,'' said agent Bill Duffy, who,
as a member of the agents' advisory board to the NBA Players
Association, thinks it's time for reform. ``You could use all your
fingers and all your toes and not come close to counting all those
who have failed.''
</P>
<P>
   A minimum age requirement
</P>
<P>
   During his annual ``State of the Game'' address at the start of
the NBA Finals, Commissioner David Stern said the league and
players association were contemplating a minimum age limit for
players entering the league, probably 20 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Such a limit would probably have to be made in conjunction with
an arrangement with the Continental Basketball Association or
another developmental league to give young players not academically
qualified for college a place to play.
</P>
<P>
   And Stern said the NBA was awaiting word from the NCAA
concerning a league proposal, at the suggestion of the players
association, to provide potential NBA prospects with loans or
subsidies in college. The hope is that providing financial help to
college players might reduce the temptation to leave early for pro
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many different components to this issue,'' Stern
said. ``One being the notion that so many kids are drawn . . . to
believe they will play (in the NBA), but so few actually do that.
It is a dream that is not fair, almost, and perhaps we could slow
that down a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many, many businesses have certain minimum-age requirements,
and we are sort of pushed in that direction now by a variety of
different concerns that have been expressed to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Those concerns include what has happened with Odom, who clearly
was not sure about the decisions he made. The NCAA has ruled that
he would not be eligible, so Odom is in Wednesday's draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a classic example of what's happening to the modern
athlete,'' Percudani said. ``He went to three different high
schools, can't get into college, street agents all around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He becomes indebted to people and beholden to people who are
taking him for a ride because of what he could eventually be. These
kids live in a virtual-reality world. Then every once in a while,
they wake up and ask themselves, `Am I moving too fast? Am I good
enough for this?' And he panics.''
</P>
<P>
   A rookie salary scale
</P>
<P>
   The NBA often is criticized for throwing money at young
athletes, tempting them out of the college programs before they're
ready. It's an image the league is fighting, and one with which
Suns General Manager Brya Colangelo takes exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wholeheartedly disagree with the people who say it's the
NBA's fault,'' Colangelo said. ``There are a lot of hurdles to
clear, but we've tried to slow down the process by implementing the
rookie salary scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially a three-year scale, the latest collective bargaining
agreement puts rookies under a four-year scale with the club having
first-right-of-refusal for another three years _ keeping players
from being full free agents for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Many argue the rookie scale has had an opposite effect on young
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a player's standpoint, he sees that if he comes out at
18, then he's in his peak years when that seven years is up,''
Duffy said. ``From their vantage point, the sooner the clock starts
ticking, the sooner they get to free agency.''
</P>
<P>
   A breakthrough may be coming.
</P>
<P>
   The players association has long resisted a developmental
arrangement between the NBA and CBA or other such league. But
Thomas, a former president of the union and a former president of
the Toronto Raptors, is negotiating for the purchase of the CBA.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas has the influence to bring all the parties together. With
the CBA acting as an official minor league, young players who don't
qualify for college or who want to leave early but aren't old
enough to meet the NBA's minimum age, could be sent to a CBA
affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   There, the player would be in a system that mirrors that of the
major league baseball club. Instead of sitting on the end of a
bench or being hidden on an injured list, a player would be getting
valuable time in a quality professional league.
</P>
<P>
   Linking the leagues
</P>
<P>
   CBA Commissioner Gary Hunter refused to comment on the
negotiations with Thomas, but he said his league had strived for
years to accomplish a direct link with the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us in the CBA are very much pro-education,'' Hunter
said. ``Nothing would please us more than to see these young men
stay in college for four years, mature physically, mentally and
emotionally and develop their basketball skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we also can see a trend that's not going to go away. We're
going to have to deal with it. We think we play the second-best
basketball played in the entire world in the CBA. Our league is
very, very competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't realize the average age is between 23 and 24
years old. It's very difficult for players to come directly out of
high school and compete at the level of this league.''
</P>
<P>
   An example is Stephen Jackson, a second-round draft pick of the
Suns in 1997. Jackson was an Arizona recruit who did not qualify
academically. He enrolled at a junior college but never played
there. The Suns waived Jackson in the preseason, and he was later
cut by a CBA club.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter says the CBA could be fashioned to work with young
players such as Jackson and teach them more than just basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some ideas,'' he said. ``We could modify our
schedule, put in a life-skills program and work with the NBA and
the NBA Players Association to come up with a true affiliation. Let
players come to our league for a few games, a few weeks or a few
months and work on their games or mature.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players association's feeling, frankly, is that if NBA
teams expand their rosters and assign players to the CBA, that's a
reduction in free agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to persuade them that it's more job opportunities. A
young player may not be in Salt Lake City playing for the Jazz, but
he could be in their organization assigned to the Idaho Stampede.
He would still be monitored closely and tutored by the home team,
within their system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of rehabing on the injured list, he could be getting
some very valuable, precious game time.''
</P>
<P>
   But the viewpoint of the players association could change. Billy
Hunter, the executive director of the union, did not return phone
calls from ``The Arizona Republic.'' But Duffy said he and other
agents have made their feelings known. They support Thomas' ideas
for the CBA, which are endorsed by Gary Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much better would (Portland's) Jermaine O'Neal be right
now if he had been playing 40 minutes a game the last three
years?'' Duffy said. ``Maybe we have to put a limit on it. After a
certain number of years, a player can't be sent down.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think Isiah's vision makes a lot of sense because we're
not developing young players. It's time for some alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   On that much, everyone seems to agree. And Stern said he thought
the place to start was with the age restriction.
</P>
<P>
   ``(It) might encourage certain kids, whose lives are literally
ruined because they get and follow bad advice, from making those
bad decisions,'' he said. ``It is really an interesting subject
that we are wrestling with. . . . It is one of the most difficult
things we have had to deal with.'' &QL;

STEVENSON WELL-EDUCATED BY MOM'S HOME SCHOOLING

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Martina Navratilova has just won her ninth Wimbledon.
It is 1990, and she is telling a TV reporter, ``Somewhere out there
is a 9-year-old working on her game, who'll be standing here as
champion some day.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexandra Stevenson, watching in an out-there called San Diego,
shouts toward the kitchen, ``Mom . . . mom . . . that's me
Martina's talking about!''
</P>
<P>
   Alexandra Stevenson made up her mind then: ``I would win
Wimbledon when I was 19. I don't know why 19, but I figured it
would take about 10 years. So if I cheat by a year, that's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine years pass. With them countless lessons from illustrious
pros, the usual growing pains, and a date for the recent senior
prom, an event unknown to most tennis prodigies. Even _ no kidding
_ a high school diploma, a document that undereducated girls on the
circuit, a majority, might equate with a Nobel Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Now Alexandra is here as she always believed she'd be. She
hasn't won yet, understand. Her 6-3, 6-3, stunning of 11th-seeded
Julie Halard-Decugis Saturday was a third-rounder. But after
curtsying all around to an admiring gathering way out at Court 13,
the tall, tawny kid out of LaJolla Country Day School is one of the
unlikelys to scuffle and sneak through the first week at the Big W
and find herself among 16 survivors. She is No. 86 in a universe
she intends to conquer.
</P>
<P>
   Alexandra finished the afternoon job with a flourish, a
sprinting forehand along the line that eluded the Frenchwoman's
racket. With this victory she joyously proclaimed, ``I'm free!''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: She will not sign the letter of intent binding her
to UCLA. With that non-stroke she turned her strong back on
amateurism and declared herself a pro.
</P>
<P>
   Instead she will cart around a stack of books from a carton
given her as a graduation present by a San Diego poet, Susan
Pollis. ``I think there are about 100, and Susan says reading them
all will be a great education. I'm reading Sinclair Lewis's ``Main
Street'' right now, with John Steinbeck's ``The Grapes of Wrath''
next.''
</P>
<P>
   One more win, over another American, Lisa Raymond, Monday would
put Stevenson on main street all right, the quarters of her initial
major.
</P>
<P>
   The book box did not include Bill Tilden, one of the game's
foremost champs and authors, who wrote: ``Great champions are not
born. They're made on their own _ and their coaches' _ efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexandra has that in her head via a triple play: Tilden to
Vines to Stevenson. ``I've been very lucky with the people who've
helped me one way or another, coaching and advice,'' says
Alexandra. ``I met Ellsworth Vines (US and Wimbledon champ in 1932)
before he died, and he passed that along to me from Tilden
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   So another ``Me and Mom Show'' is unfolding at Wimbledon where a
more celebrated one closed early (presumably temporarily) as
Martina Hingis was beaten in the first round. That left Martina and
parent Melanie Molitor with nothing much to do for a while and the
Stevensons _ Alexandra and Samantha _ ready and willing to stand
in, even upstage the Swiss pair.
</P>
<P>
   There's a difference in styles even though this mother, Samantha
Stevenson, is no less ambitious or determined on behalf of the
child she has raised alone. While Melanie is the coach with an
aversion to speaking English, or anything, to reporters, Samantha,
a journalist by trade, maybe the game's first press agent parent.
She is comfortable mixing with scribblers and babblers, obviously a
facilitator in obtaining the best in tutelage. Craig Kardon,
veteran of several years as Navratilova's coach, is the latest.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter at Boston's Ch. 7 in 1974, and a sportswriter in
various ports of call including the New York Times, Samantha is a
savvy lady who has schooled her daughter well in dealing with the
press and public. Alexandra comes across as a delightful, polite,
and outgoing kid with big brown eyes, and, at 6 feet 1 inch, a big
serve, too. She takes to the local lawns with adroit volleying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to play an attacking game, but it wasn't always that
way.'' Two of her earlier coaches had clashing ideas. Robert
Lansdorp, launcher of US champs Tracy Austin and Lindsay Davenport,
teaches both-handed backhands and baselining. Dr. Pete Fisher,
developer of Pete Sampras, insisted that Sampras and Stevenson use
one hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was traumatic for a while,'' recounts mom. ``Playing a
16-and-under final when she was 11, Alexandra was instructed by
Fisher never to use two hands again. But she was losing. She felt
she could win if she went back to the two-handed, and did. Fisher
was furious, and threatened to drop her. She cried. But we worked
it out.'' Today only the right hand is involved with the racket.
</P>
<P>
   She's a wage-earner now, and the $100 bills that the old
hustler, Bobby Riggs, held out for her don't seem so big now.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom took me to hit with Bobby. You remember when he played
Billie Jean King at the Astrodome, don't you? Anyway, he would put
$100 bills under cones on the court. `You hit the cone and you get
the money,' he told me. But you know how tricky Bobby was. He hit
the balls at me in a way I could never hit the cones.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be more tricky times and opponents, but I'm sure
there's a book in that gift carton of classics whose title covers
her dreams: Charles Dickens's ``Great Expectations.''

EXPANSION MOLD BROKEN BY D-BACKS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX -The Arizona Diamondbacks, should they still be
considered an expansion club?
</P>
<P>
   That's the question many folks in baseball are posing as the
Diamondbacks spend their 31st consecutive day atop the National
League West standings today.
</P>
<P>
   The problem some in the game have with the Diamondbacks'
meteoric rise is that they have ignored traditional avenues in
building a contender. Basically, they've circumvented the way
things have been done by expansion clubs since the Los Angeles
Angels and Washington Senators first were added to the league in
1961.
</P>
<P>
   They have built through free agency, much like every other
big-market team in recent years. Yet they aren't the typical
expansion team lagging at the bottom of the standings, building a
farm system and waiting for the young talent to develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the true sense of the word, they are an expansion team,''
said Toronto General Manager Gord Ash, who has been with the Blue
Jays since their inception in 1977. ``The term expansion has always
been used in a negative aspect in our game. It's always meant less
than stellar performance. Clearly, the Diamondbacks are changing
that thought, much like Colorado and Florida each did in making the
playoffs in their first five years. I think it's a wise trend. It
doesn't suit anybody to sit there and lose for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Because baseball is the tradition-packed game it is, some would
have preferred that the Diamondbacks take a more conservative
approach and follow the time-consuming route of building through
the farm system, a process that left the Toronto Blue Jays,
considered the model expansion franchise, waiting nine seasons
before making the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the protest over the Diamondbacks' philosophy has come
from the NL West, where several front-office members seem to spend
their days grinding their teeth as they scan the NL West standings
and have to look ``up'' to the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The definition of expansion has changed dramatically over the
years,'' Diamondbacks Managing General Partner Jerry Colangelo
said. ``The price of admission has changed, as have values and
salaries. So has competition for the sports dollar, in terms of fan
support. There's much more pressure today than there was 20 years
ago or even 10 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The loudest opposing voice to the Diamondbacks plan resides in
San Francisco, where Giants managing general partner Peter Magowan
has spent months lashing out against Colangelo and the
Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Magowan railed against Arizona in a recent magazine article,
citing what he called the out-of-control spending habits of the
Diamondbacks and Los Angeles Dodgers. He also said that Colangelo
and the Dodgers broke promises they gave when they entered the
inner-circle of Major League Baseball owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Colangelo) departed from his announced strategy,'' Magowan
told the ``Sports Business Journal.'' ``The group that bought the
Dodgers did the same thing. . . . I'm used to doing business with
people you can trust and they tell you what they're going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Magowan is the same owner who was taken to task by
fellow owners in December 1992 when he signed then-free agent Barry
Bonds to a six-year $42 million contract, by far the largest ever
given at that time.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, of course, are the Diamondbacks' closest competitors
in the NL West. At least one other club's management in the NL
West, that of the San Diego Padres, has also openly criticized the
Diamondbacks' spending. Padres owner John Moores voiced his
displeasure with the $118.9 million the Diamondbacks spent on free
agents over the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in the NL West is busy sniping at the Diamondbacks.
Colorado General Manager Bob Gebhard, who oversaw the Rockies'
quick rise as they made the playoffs faster than any previous
expansion club in 1995, is sympathetic to the Diamondbacks plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is what it is, a franchise in its second year of
operations,'' Gebhard said. ``They've made great strides and been
very active in the free-agent market. I give them a lot of credit
for the changes they've made. They made a stand. Colangelo wanted
to improve that ballclub and Joe (Garagiola Jr.) and Buck
(Showalter) have made a great job in selecting players.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Rockies' playoff season in 1995, just their third
year of existence, Colorado's payroll was $30.5 million. The top
payroll that season belonged to the Showalter-managed New York
Yankees, who were paying $46.3 million in salaries.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks current payroll stands around $65 million. The
top figure in the game once again belongs to the Yankees, who have
an $85-million payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other expansion clubs, the Diamondbacks have one very big
factor working in their favor: Bank One Ballpark. The stadium,
regarded as one of the top five in baseball, is a virtual cash cow.
In terms of in-house advertising and sponsorships, BOB brought in
more money than any other stadium last season. In turn, it allows
the Diamondbacks to be active on the free-agent market.
</P>
<P>
   ``A new ballpark can do a lot for a club,'' said Texas General
Manager Doug Melvin, who has seen the Rangers' revenues jump since
they moved into the Ballpark in Arlington in 1994. ``From a
financial standpoint, that can do wonders.''
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo insists there will be no gloating from his end, that
he and the organization are in this for the long haul. Nor, he
added, should anyone take exception to how they are going about
their business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expected ``modus operandi'' for an expansion team today is
different, just by the nature of how the system has changed,''
Colangelo said. ``The old prototype doesn't exist anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Colorado experience and the Florida experience _
although two different paths were selected, one had a game plan and
got to playoffs in a record three years; the other changed their
game plan after four years and were able to gain a championship
when all the stars aligned _ there's no question times have
changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be able to adjust in midstream. In our case, our
basis was much higher coming in.'' &QL;

PHILLIPS HOPES TO TEST NFL WATERS AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Every time he goes to the beach, Lawrence
Phillips knows how far he's slipped.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few weeks, the first-round draft
choice-turned-Barcelona Dragon has walked to the shores of the
Mediterranean Sea to soak his battered ankle in the soothing water
instead of dunking it in a whirlpool bath _ because the only
whirlpool bath where he is comes attached to the environment.
</P>
<P>
   When he finishes his self-directed medical treatment, Phillips
limps off for another practice session and once a week he goes out
and tears apart the untutored defenses of NFL Europe, the minor
league that has become his refuge and his last chance. Phillips has
done this well enough to become the first player in league history
to rush for 1,000 yards, piling up 1,021, scoring 14 touchdowns and
averaging 5.5 yards a carry against the likes of the Scottish
Claymores and Frankfurt Galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   Such numbers are the kind people in the NFL notice, which is why
scouts from several teams will be in Dusseldorf, Germany, to watch
Phillips in the World Bowl championship game Sunday while many
personnel people around the NFL continue to gaze at tape of his
performances and wonder what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, Phillips was a troubled All-American on two
Nebraska national championship teams before becoming the sixth
player taken in the 1996 NFL draft. He was the kind of back you
could build a future with, the St. Louis Rams hoped, despite
personal demons that threatened him almost daily.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips spent his formative years in a juvenile home for
troubled kids in California and in college he was charged with
assaulting an ex-girlfriend, dragging her half-naked by her hair
down three flights of stairs. This was not the only problem he had
at Nebraska, only the most publicized one.
</P>
<P>
   He was suspended from the team but allowed back in time to star
in the Fiesta Bowl, a controversial move that former coach Tom
Osborne now admits may have been a mistake. Phillips then settled a
civil suit the ex-girlfriend filed against him and claimed to be
working on anger management.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips moved on to the NFL, and the Rams paid him millions.
But soon he was arrested and later convicted for drunk driving,
allegedly for going nearly 80 miles an hour through a neighborhood
posted at 35.
</P>
<P>
   In his second year, Phillips was charged with disorderly conduct
in an Omaha hotel and spent 23 days in jail for a probation
violation. Upon his release, his coach, Dick Vermeil, took him out
the jail's back door to avoid the media.
</P>
<P>
   Vermeil also fined Phillips more than 50 times, mostly for being
late to meetings and practices. This went on until Phillips finally
stormed out once too often and was released 10 games into the 1997
season. He was leading the team in rushing at the time.
</P>
<P>
   But players like Phillips are seldom out of second chances, and
he got one when the Dolphins signed him several weeks later. He
lasted two games before being released basically for being a pain
in the buttocks _ which is what leads him to be soaking his ankle
in the Mediterranean before the World Bowl, with at least four NFL
teams apparently ready to give him his latest last chance.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't seem to come as much of a surprise to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came here, there weren't really any targets,'' Phillips
said during a press conference at which he was named World League
Offensive MVP. ``I just wanted to come over here and play like I
knew I could. There were no specific stats that I wanted to reach,
just come out here and help us win a championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The reason) why the players are all coming over here is to
impress the NFL scouts. When they notice and come over, it makes
everybody feel like we've gotten the job done. I owe Coach (Jack
Bicknell) a great debt. I was very happy to find out they drafted
me and were going to give me a chance to play. Coach called but
there was no big speech or anything. He just said, `You know what
you have to do. Come over and play.' And that's what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is no longer quite enough. Although Green Bay, Oakland,
Kansas City, and Washington are considering signing Phillips if the
price is right, many other teams believe that, as well as he's
played, it's not worth taking the risk on him yet.
</P>
<P>
   Ravens coach Brian Billick said as much last week when he told
the Baltimore Sun that he'd been looking at Phillips on tape but
added, ``I would need to know more about him. I would need a
face-to-face with him . . . If we signed him, we wouldn't be doing
it as some benevolent gesture. The parameters we'd set would be
very narrow and definable. If you're late for one meeting, you're
gone. We're not experienced enough to absorb a problem . . . but he
may not be a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, he may be, because he has been one everywhere he's
been except Barcelona, which is a problem in itself.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are so desperate for a big-time NFL back that
they've worked out broken-down veterans such as Harold Green, Terry
Allen, Raymont Harris, and James Stewart (the one who used to be
with the Vikings, not the one with the Jaguars), but vice president
of player personnel Bobby Grier said Phillips is not on his list.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nobody else on the horizon,'' Grier said of the backs
he's considering signing when salary cap money finally appears. ``I
hear Baltimore, Kansas City, Oakland, and Green Bay are interested
in him but I don't know if you can ever know if the guy will revert
to what he's done in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a model citizen over there so far but I just wonder
how many people change their stripes once they get back to the
States and have some money again. It's a question I have, but he'll
surface somewhere in the NFL and play because there are enough
people willing to take a chance on a big, strong, fast guy like
Lawrence.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, indeed, but not as many as there were in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Even Phillips seemed to understand the changed nature of things.
Running with a football hasn't changed much, even in Dusseldorf,
but the rest of his life has, and he need only walk down to the sea
to understand the breadth of those changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough on a running back because it's one of the toughest
positions as far as trying to recover from game to game,'' Phillips
said. ``But you have to make it work. I get out in the sea and let
that be a whirlpool for me. That's the best you can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a little bit like high school in that we had to make
do with what we had. You don't have every resource that you have in
the States but we've made it work.''
</P>
<P>
   So far he has, but how much farther it will go, nobody knows.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the Chiefs end up winning the Lawrence Phillips Sweepstakes,
they'll qualify to open a branch of Boys Town in their backfield.
Kansas City already has Bam Morris, who is working on his fourth
team because of off-field drug problems and Phillips would be
working on his third in four years. Morris is considered the
Chiefs' best back, and they intend to use him or whomever they end
up with to get back to playing power football. Morris admits that
he weighed 300 pounds when he got out of a Texas jail last year but
is working to get down to his old playing weight of 248. Morris
sounded the same tone in Kansas City that Phillips did in
Barcelona, with one eerie exception. ``People around here seem to
realize that everyone will have problems in life,'' Morris said.
``But the big thing is, where do you go after that? Do you go down
the same path that got you in trouble or do you make a complete 360
and do the right thing?'' Unfortunately, if you make a complete
360, you're right back where you started from . . . Phillips
dropped his weight from 240 to 215 and may go down to 210 to
prepare for his return to the NFL. ``When I was in college, I put
on about 10 pounds and it didn't hurt me,'' Phillips said. ``I went
from about 200 to 210-215 and I got better. I kept putting on
weight and I didn't think it would hurt me. I got up to 235-240 and
it kind of slowed me down. Gradually, I started to notice it and I
dropped the weight and feel a lot better. I'm definitely a better
player than I was in St. Louis and Miami.'' . . . While the warring
factions in Los Angeles continue to flail away at each other rather
than reach a compromise that would allow the Coliseum to be
repaired in timely fashion or construction to begin on a new
stadium, the clock keeps ticking on their efforts to convince the
NFL to give them an expansion team. It is ticking also on Houston
businessman Robert McNair, who is all set to bring expansion to
that city but will lose his financing for a stadium in January if a
deal with the league isn't done by then. That's why some insiders
among ownership say they will enforce the Sept. 15 deadline on Los
Angeles for significant progress to be made on the stadium
problems. Some owners and NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue wanted
Gov. Gray Davis of California to get involved, and last week he
did. If something doesn't break over the summer, McNair may get the
team he deserves . . . If the LA efforts at expansion fail, don't
be surprised to see Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis join forces with
movie and oil mogul Marvin Davis to reenergize plans for a new
stadium at Hollywood Park. Marvin Davis recently bought land and
the rights to build a new stadium there, and Al Davis has always
insisted he never gave up his rights to the LA market when he took
the Raiders back to Oakland. Count on two things: If Davis builds
it, Davis will come, and if Davis builds it and Davis comes, the
NFL won't be able to do a thing about it . . . The financial
problems of Ravens owner Art Modell are forcing him to sell a
minority share of his team with a likely option for the new partner
to buy the club in the event Modell decides to sell, and this has a
number of owners upset with him. Modell claimed financial problems
in Cleveland forced him to move the Browns despite strong fan
support, and he landed a sweetheart deal in Baltimore. Now he
claims he can't make a $29 million relocation payment he owes the
other owners and is trying to get them to waive it or float him a
loan. There is little sympathy for Modell because many owners
believe he has self-inflicted problems resulting from a profligate
lifestyle. Patriots owner Robert Kraft will be a powerful figure in
this situation from his perch as chairman of the league's Finance
Committee, which would oversee any such assistance. Kraft has been
mum on the subject, but Modell has already taken public hits from
Bills owner Ralph Wilson and Giants owner Robert Tisch . . . The
NFL has decided to allow line judge Byron Boston to work the
Arizona-Denver exhibition game Aug. 14 in which his son David is
likely to be playing for the Cardinals. That would not be allowed
in the regular season or playoffs, but head of officials Jerry
Seeman decided it would not be a problem in the preseason and would
be a nice thing for both father and son. It is believed to be the
first father-son/official-player coincidence in league history . .
. Here's how things can take on a life of their own. John Thompson,
the portly Browns fan made famous by the huge dog bone he used to
wear in the end zone seats known as the Dawg Pound at the old
Stadium, has so many offers to make appearances that he's hired an
attorney to represent him . . . If you've got an extra prayer, say
it for longtime 49ers offensive line coach Bobb McKittrick, whose
battle with cancer is not going well. McKittrick recently learned
the liver transplant he needs cannot be done until the cancer,
which has spread from his bile duct, is contained. McKittrick, one
of the NFL's best assistant coaches and a gentleman, is facing an
uphill battle, but the old Marine fights on.

JIMENEZ: `I'M STILL VERY EXCITED, VERY HAPPY' 
 NO-HITTER SINKS IN SLOWLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Jose Jimenez jogged along the dirt warning track on
the edge of the field at Bank One Ballpark on Saturday, looking up
at the rows of empty seats.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 24 hours before, on Friday night, they were filled
with screaming fans as the St. Louis Cardinals' rookie right-hander
threw the first no-hitter of his career and the first no-hitter in
the major leagues this season.
</P>
<P>
   He struck out eight and allowed only three runners (two walks
and a hit batter) in the 1-0 victory over Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Beads of sweat rolled down Jimenez's face and neck after the
run. Someone mentioned he hardly broke a sweat Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Then Jimenez's infectious smile returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know . . . I was working pretty hard out there,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Was it still a bit hard to believe, despite all the
chest-bumping (watch out for Mr. McGwire) and revelry afterward in
the clubhouse?
</P>
<P>
   ``A little,'' Jimenez said. ``I'm still very excited, very
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old said he didn't really celebrate. Oh, there may
have been a few thoughts of a Presidente, perhaps the most popular
beer in his native Dominican Republic, crossing his lips, but it
isn't available in many places in the United States. He said he
wanted to concentrate on telling his family back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all happy for me. It was a big moment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's Big Unit, left-hander Randy Johnson, recognized the
big moment. Johnson, who struck out 14 and gave up the Cardinals'
run on five hits, called Jimenez at his hotel room to congratulate
him.
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez (4-7, 6.02 ERA) threw a no-hitter while with the
Cardinals' Double-A Arkansas affiliate last season, but claimed he
wasn't sure he had a no-hitter going this time until about the
eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alberto (Castillo) wouldn't let me look at the scoreboard. He
just encouraged me the whole time, kept me going, you know, `Come
on, let's go!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Said Castillo: ``You don't want them to look at the scoreboard
in a situation like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Cardinals catcher Joe Garagiola was broadcasting Friday
night's game for the Diamondbacks' radio network. It was the fourth
no-hitter he has seen: The others were thrown by Cleveland's Dick
Bosman, Houston's Nolan Ryan and Minnesota's Jack Morris.
</P>
<P>
   Garagiola said Castillo's work behind the plate was key, keeping
Jimenez's mind in the game, providing a wide target and making a
crucial catch of a third strike against Andy Fox in the ninth. The
pitch was borderline low, and Garagiola said the fact that Castillo
caught it with the mitt facing down rather than up perhaps provided
the illusion that the pitch was higher.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals Manager Tony La Russa said the most important aspect
of the effort ``was that it came in a clutch situation with the
game so close and the fact we had lost a heartbreaking game the
night before (Arizona won, 8-7), it came against a quality-hitting
team in their own park. All his pitches were working to all parts
of the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   There would be no disagreement from Arizona third baseman Matt
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sinker,'' Williams said, shaking his head at the thought.
``It was hard to square up on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Cardinals rookie, second baseman Joe McEwing, made the
game's final play on a ground ball by Tony Womack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been a part of anything like that. You sort of want
the ball to be hit to you (for the last out), but you have to
concentrate on the hitter and see what happens. It's something I'll
always remember,'' said McEwing.
</P>
<P>
   So will Arizona Manager Buck Showalter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we lost, it's a part of baseball history and you
have to take that moment in,'' he said. &QL;

EXPANSION TWINS DEVELOP DIFFERENTLY  
 D-BACKS DEAL, DEVIL RAYS STAND PAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just 19 months after Arizona and Tampa Bay participated in the
expansion draft, one thing has become abundantly clear: These two
franchises are taking opposite paths as they build.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, these two organizations will be linked for years
to come. It's just the way it is with expansion clubs. Toronto and
Seattle, which both joined the American League in 1977, are still
compared with one another, as are Colorado and Florida, the 1993
expansion club class.
</P>
<P>
   Of the original 35 expansion picks each club made on Nov. 17,
1997, the Diamondbacks have just 10 remaining in their
organization. At the other end of the spectrum, Tampa Bay still has
26 in its system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advice we got _ independently from people with the Marlins
and Rockies _ was that after you've scouted as long as you scouted
and they're finally your players, not to really get too attached to
them,'' said Diamondbacks General Manager Joe Garagiola Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never lose sight of the fact that you have to
immediately look and ask, `How do we get better?' After all, these
are not the players we're going to win a championship with. You
have to sort through them and see who can be part of your long-term
process.''
</P>
<P>
   In sifting through their draft picks, the Diamondbacks
discovered they may very well have some pieces to their puzzle in
players such as pitcher Omar Daal and outfielder David Dellucci, to
name two.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 25 players on the active big-league roster, the Devil
Rays have eight expansion picks. The Diamondbacks have six.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't keep a guy simply because he was one of your
originals,'' said Baltimore General Manager Frank Wren, who was an
assistant GM with the Florida Marlins during their expansion year.
``If you find a diamond in the rough, like we did with Jeff Conine
or Colorado did with a Vinny Castilla, or if you have a guy you
feel is a long-range fit, you keep him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, I don't think it is a bad thing to turn over the
expansion picks; I think it's a healthy thing. A lot of times when
you're making trades, you might get two-for-one. If the deal is
good enough, you do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona has been much more aggressive when it's come to trading
than Tampa Bay. Since the handful of deals made the night of the
expansion draft, the Diamondbacks have not been afraid to delve
into the trade market. The acquisition of reliever Dan Plesac from
Toronto two weeks ago was the 15th for Arizona since the expansion
draft. They're looking to make No. 16, a move to further help the
sagging bullpen, in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Tampa Bay has made one trade in the 19 months
since the draft, sending pitcher Jason Johnson to Baltimore for
outfielder Danny Clyburn.
</P>
<P>
   In all fairness, the Diamondbacks have much more money to play
with than their expansion counterparts on the central Florida
coast, where attendance is dropping quicker than any projections.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of equal revenue streams for Tampa Bay may be keeping
it from making glitzy free-agent acquisitions which, in turn, keeps
the Devil Rays from turning over their expansion draft picks.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay has also been hit hard by injuries to their draft
picks. The Devil Rays currently have eight of their original 35 on
the disabled list, six of those on the major league DL.
</P>
<P>
   ``You still have to remember that when you're drafting an
organization's players who are unprotected, at best, you're getting
their 16th best player,'' Florida GM Dave Dombrowski said. ``Lot's
of times it's further down the list than that. You have to be
careful because if you're looking to win championships, you'd be be
fortunate to have even one of those draft picks around.'' &QL;

   LONDON _ Where to start? Well, let's see, he beat . . . no,
that's not right. But how about that match in . . . oops, cancel
that. And then there was the time he . . . uh, no, he didn't, did

   The 24-year-old Swiss tennis nonentity has found it almost
impossible to get into Wimbledon, let alone into its second week.
When the tournament began, he ranked a lofty 196th in the world,
owing to his gilded record in Grand Slam, ATP Tour, and Davis Cup
matches _ 0-11. That's for his seven-year career, if you can call
it that.
</P>
<P>
   But, implausibly, he took out the No. 5 men's seed and 1996
champion Richard Krajicek, 6-3, 7-6 (7-5), 4-6, 4-6, 6-4, in a
2-hour 47-minute third-round exercise in shock therapy on the All
England Club's dreaded Court 2.
</P>
<P>
   The color theme here is green, and tradition is sacrosanct, but
they really ought to make an exception for No. 2. Drape it in black
crepe and resod it with 6 feet of dirt. Krajicek would gladly
oversee the remodeling, perhaps Sunday on the traditional
mid-tournament hiatus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's far less a court than Centre or No. 1,'' he said.
``There's a lot of worse bounces. For me, the reason why it's
called graveyard is because they've been digging it or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite, Richard. It's the results, not the conditions, that
cause Court 2 to live in infamy as ``The Graveyard of Champions.''
Krajicek became the latest name on a gold-embossed tombstone that
already included Ilie Nastase, Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe, Arthur
Ashe, Boris Becker, and, just two days ago, Arantxa Sanchez
Vicario.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Sanchez Vicario's funeral, Krajicek, the man from
the Netherlands, had emerged from that netherworld by disposing of
Todd Woodbridge. But the All England folks must have a grudge
against Krajicek; they put him on 2 again. Still, he had every
right to beat Manta, because just about everybody has _ including
Krajicek four years ago in a Davis Cup singles match he considers
so noteworthy that he couldn't remember a thing about it.
</P>
<P>
   There's no shame in that; Manta is hard-pressed to come up with
personal highlights himself. Asked what had been his peak
accomplishment, he paused for the longest time, tugged on his
baseball cap, and said, somewhat sheepishly, ``I don't know. Not
too much, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is life for a 6-foot-3-inch, 180-pounder who roams the
shadow world of tennis, primarily playing the satellite and
challenger circuits when he's not trying _ and failing _ to qualify
for the majors. It's basically a blur of ineptitude to him. He
knows he's tried to make the French and US Opens, but he can't
specify how many times. The number of successes is easier to
compute: zero.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, Wimbledon has been a garden spot for Manta. It's
the only Grand Slam event in which he's made the main draw _ in
1996, when he advanced all the way to the first round before losing
to Alexander Volkov in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, freed from the litany of shoulder, elbow, and
hand injuries that, along with consistent failure, prompted him to
consider retirement a couple of years ago, Manta has made a
breakthrough. He beat Tom Spinks in the first round, then knocked
off 49th-ranked Jan-Michael Gambill. And he didn't consider his
task against Krajicek hopeless. ``I felt I had a chance,'' he said.
``A small one.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he was a preying Manta right from the start, stunning
Krajicek by capturing the first two sets, the second in a 7-5
tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was serving pretty well in the first two sets,'' said Manta,
``and you have to keep focusing against him because you don't get
many chances to break him, and I got the first break right at the
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   The natural order seemed about to prevail when Krajicek took the
next two sets. But Manta pounced again, breaking his opponent in
the first game of the fifth set and shaking off thoughts of the
inevitable when Krajicek erased that advantage by breaking back to
3-4. Manta then became a bulldog on his returns, and when he broke
Krajicek on match point with a slice down the line, Court 2 had
struck again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let a few important points go,'' said Krajicek, ``but in the
end, I was surprised how well he played because I expected him
actually to get a little nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Manta let him in on a little secret: ``I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Wait until he sees his paycheck. Having piled up $151,305 in
lifetime earnings before landing in London, he's guaranteed $50,960
for reaching the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
   Manta set off the lone tremor as Wimbledon's weeklong
sorting-out process concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Second seed Patrick Rafter avenged his Australian Open loss to
Thomas Enqvist, 7-6 (7-5), 6-2, 6-2; No. 4 Andre Agassi, the French
champ, lost his first set of the week but still dispatched Alberto
Martin, 6-2, 6-0, 2-6, 6-3; No. 8 Todd Martin withstood Jens
Knippschild, 6-7 (5-7), 6-1, 7-6 (8-6), 7-5; No. 10 Goran
Ivanisevic swept Paul Haarhuis, 7-6 (7-2), 6-4, 7-6 (7-3); and
three-time winner Becker extended his second Wimbledon farewell in
three years by ousting Lleyton Hewitt, 6-1, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5).
</P>
<P>
   There were no surprises among the top 10 women as No. 3 Lindsay
Davenport whipped Laura Golarsa, 6-3, 6-2; defender and fifth seed
Jana Novotna paid back Maria Antonia Sanchez Lorenzo for her
Australian Open defeat, 6-4, 6-3; and No. 9 Mary Pierce subdued
Elena Wagner, 6-3, 6-0. Meanwhile, qualifier Jelena Dokic, Martina
Hingis's conqueror, remained a fairy princess at least until next
week, beating Anne Kremer, 6-7 (7-9), 6-3, 6-4.

U.S. SOCCER STAR OFTEN RUNS ON EMPTY  
 AKERS SUFFERS CHRONIC FATIGUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM THOMAS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Michelle Akers seemed to struggle to force out the
words. It was difficult for her to admit that, perhaps, a day off
might be a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   Akers doesn't want to sit out any match, or even a part of a
match, especially not during this premier international soccer
event, the Women's World Cup. But with the U.S. national team all
be assured of advancing to the quarterfinals, U.S. Coach Tony
DiCicco will likely rest Akers and a few other starters tonight
against North Korea in the Group A finale at Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   After a practice session on Saturday at Babson College, neither
DiCicco nor Akers would tip their hands as to who would be the
starters. DiCicco said he had his lineup fairly well set in his
mind, but would not release it to the public. Akers laughingly said
she couldn't ``give away our top-secret plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Akers knows better than any other player the value of a day
off. The veteran midfielder suffers from chronic fatigue syndrome,
a disease that saps her strength and forces wholesale changes in
her lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone would notice when she is on the field. Akers,
33, has been with the national program since its inception in 1985.
She is one of only four players in the world to score more than 100
goals. At 5 feet 10, she is intimidating on defense and an imposing
and dangerous figure in front of the opposition's net.
</P>
<P>
   But Akers knows she must pace herself throughout the grueling
World Cup schedule. She was replaced before the second half of
Thursday's 7-1 victory over Nigeria in Chicago, and insists she
won't complain should DiCicco opt to rest her again tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating and at times I get really ticked off,'' Akers
said of needing to take an occasional break because of her disease.
``Seeing the team do well and get excited while I'm sitting on the
bench is tough to deal with. But if Tony decides to give me a rest,
I won't, as my dad says, puff out my chest, curl my lower lip and
pout. I know this World Cup is a sprint, it's not a marathon.''
</P>
<P>
   In order for Akers to reach the finish line, of even a single
match, she must make concessions to her disease. She doesn't
participate in all the team drills during practice. She adheres to
a stringent diet. She receives intravenous fluids after playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go into a game with only half a tank and you expend
that in the first half, you use up the tank too quickly,'' she
said. ``So I have to take measures to keep going as long as I can.
I evaluate what I eat, I stay hydrated and I do like I did today,
just stay off to the side and work on my own. If I can be mature
about it, stay disciplined and keep doing all the things I've been
doing, then I will be rewarded in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   While Akers' teammates are reaping the rewards now during a
World Cup that has received tremendous receptions across the United
States, Akers stays pretty much in the shadows. She doesn't attend
all the team functions and she doesn't do commercials or chat with
talk-show hosts.
</P>
<P>
   But ask any member of the team who is the most respected,
admired and inspirational player, and the majority will say
Michelle Akers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's done more for women's soccer than anyone else,''
megastar Mia Hamm said. ``From Day One, she set the standards. She
showed us the proper mentality for the game and how to work hard,
all the while being very professional about it. She's really helped
take this team and the sport of women's soccer to a higher level.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She is very much responsible for all I've learned and
accomplished in this game,'' defender Brandi Chastain said. ``I've
relied on her as a resource for many things, as a person and a
player.'' &QL;

REVELRY SPURRED ON AND ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The small room is humid on this early Saturday
morning. The smells of cigar smoke and sweat, champagne and beer
clog the air. This tiny visitors locker room at Madison Square
Garden is where the San Antonio Spurs are celebrating their first
NBA title.
</P>
<P>
   An hour earlier, these men had defeated the New York Knicks,
78-77, to win the best-of-seven Finals, four games to one. The game
ended late Friday night. Now it is after midnight, and you hear and
see things that you usually don't experience in NBA locker rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Jaren Jackson is standing in a corner, talking to a television
reporter. The reporter asks him what message he has for fans in San
Antonio, fans who might take to the streets to celebrate the
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' Jackson answers. ``You all stay away from my car! My
car is out on those streets! Don't be tearing up my car, you hear
me?''
</P>
<P>
   He cracks up laughing. He is smoking a cigar. Earlier, he played
24 minutes, made three 3-pointers, and scored 11 points. He still
is wearing his sweaty No. 2 uniform, with a ``Spurs _ NBA Champs''
T-shirt pulled over the jersey. It is covered with sweat and
champagne. He spots teammate Will Perdue, once a member of three
Chicago Bulls championship teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Will,'' says Jackson. ``When you were with the Bulls and
y'all won the title, did you take a shower?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell no,'' Perdue answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All right,'' Jackson says. ``I ain't taking a shower. I'm
going out just like this.''
</P>
<P>
   No one even tries to persuade Jackson to take five minutes and
head to a nearby shower. Maybe next time. This is a group that
seems to believe there could be many more titles in its future. The
Spurs' best player, 7-footer Tim Duncan, is 23 years old. His first
year in the league, he was the league's Rookie of the Year as well
as a first-team All-NBA forward. In his second season, he finished
third in the MVP voting, won the NBA championship, and was voted
MVP of the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan is a true original. Not simply because he averaged 23
points and 12 rebounds in the NBA Finals. It's the way he did it.
He has been playing basketball for less than 10 years, but you get
the feeling he could teach it. His go-to shot is an old one, the
bank shot. But if you start to get too comfortable around him,
thinking that he is a landlocked type, he can dunk on you as well.
</P>
<P>
   In this fifth and final game, he and New York's Latrell Sprewell
engaged in a classic sword fight (remember, Duncan collects knives
and swords). Sprewell had 35 points and Duncan 31. But Sprewell
went to a quiet locker room after the game, while Duncan showed
he's not completely old-fashioned: He immediately got hold of a
home video camera to catch the reaction of his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just making some records for myself,'' he says. ``Just keeping
it on tape. I don't know, it's a blessing to get to where I am now,
it's a blessing to do what we did this year. There's no guarantees
I'll ever get back. So I'm enjoying this team, documenting this
time.''
</P>
<P>
   It is truly a strange Saturday morning for the NBA. Usually, it
is coaches and scouts who make tapes of players. But there is
Duncan, videotaping his teammates. Just over two years ago, two
representatives from the Celtics _ Jan Volk and M.L. Carr _ sat in
a room as tiny as this one watching tapes of Duncan. He was in
college then, and the Celtics thought they were going to get him.
He made a move in that college game, and Carr looked at Volk and
smiled. He'll be doing that in Boston one day, they thought. Not
quite. He was doing that 200 miles away in New York, doing it for
the Spurs, the NBA champions.
</P>
<P>
   In a less smoky room, David Robinson is sitting with his son.
His son is asking a lot of questions. There are cameras everywhere.
Robinson, 33, is finally a champion. Echoes of Avery Johnson and
Mario Elie are everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Elie: ``I said, `Dave, shut everybody up. They can leave you
alone now. You've accomplished everything in your career. This was
the final chapter.' I told him when he wrote his autobiography, he
better have a paragraph in there about me, or at least a chapter.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson: ``He knows I'm one of his greatest critics, behind him
and to his face. Sometimes we have a love-hate relationship. That's
a guy I really love, and I'm so pumped for him right now. What else
can he do? What else can he do? He's done everything.''
</P>
<P>
   All of these Spurs have interesting stories. Take Johnson. The
Spurs once cut him on Christmas Eve. Another time, he had just
finished being a groomsman in Robinson's wedding when he found that
the Spurs had cut him again. But on Friday against the Knicks, he
hit the winning shot. He got himself open in a corner, 18 feet from
the hoop, and made a jumper with 47 seconds left. That made the
score 78-77. The smallest and most rejected Spur hit the winning
shot in the biggest game of his career.
</P>
<P>
   So, yes, understand why this small room is now so smoky and
joyous and loud. The Iceman, George Gervin, is in one corner
smiling. Security is lax, so people without the proper credentials
are now entering the room. Jackson stands up and looks at Jerome
Kersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, chief,'' he says to the veteran forward. ``We got a ring,
chief.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting for this for 15 years,'' Kersey says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chief,'' Jackson repeats, ``we've got ourselves a ring.''

VOTAW ANSWERED CALL FOR LPGA 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Del. _ The phone call came in January, on a
Thursday. From Orlando, LPGA commissioner Jim Ritts phoned deputy
commissioner Ty Votaw, who was in Waco, Texas, for the induction of
Judy Rankin into the Texas Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he was planing to resign,'' said Votaw, ``and he said
he had spoken to a number of our board members telling them of his
plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Ritts had asked the board members to talk to Votaw about his
interest in the job. Votaw, who has been with the LPGA since 1991,
flew to Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went home Sunday, talked it over with my wife, and I told
them, `If offered, I would accept it,' '' said Votaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent the next thee days talking to various board members,
mostly players. They had a board meeting on Wednesday, and on
Friday I was offered the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of it happened within a span of eight days.''
</P>
<P>
   Votaw, who studied journalism at Ohio University and received a
law degree from Ohio State, became the sixth commissioner of the
largest women's sports organization in the United States, one that
celebrates its 50th anniversary next year.
</P>
<P>
   Votaw originally was hired as general counsel by former
commissioner Charles Mechem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd worked for the LPGA for eight years, so I've learned at
the feet of two pretty good commissioners,'' he said. ``They
brought a lot to the table, so that will enable me to go into the
job with my eyes open and know what the challenges and
opportunities are.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest adjustment has been to get to work with the media.
I tell people I'm a recovering lawyer. One step in the recovery of
a lawyer is to talk to the media.''
</P>
<P>
   Votaw, who is here for the LPGA Championship at DuPont CC, has
been involved heavily with the growth of an organization that has
passed some troubled times but still suffers in comparison with the
PGA Tour and PGA Senior Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past 10 years have seen the biggest growth, and it's
important to continue to grow in a competitive marketplace,'' he
said. ``We've increased our purses over the past 10 years. We've
increased them by 75 percent over the past five years. The number
of television events has gone from 14 in 1991 to 34 this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our biggest challenge is going to be continuing to do
a good job with help from our tournament sponsors. I want to focus
on the positive realities rather than the negative perceptions that
might be out there. We're very successful. We're the most
successful women's organization I think in sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't take joy in other people's downfalls or lack of
success, but we feel very good about where we are in the sports
marketplace. We're celebrating our 50th anniversary next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, `How do you feel about the disparity between you
and the PGA Tour?' Just because we're not as successful as some
other organizations does not mean, in fact, we're not successful.
We push the number of TV hours, the quality of play, the
international expansion we've been able to do. There's a lot of
depth in the foreign players. We have a world tour. I think our
players are going to focus on that. Can we get better? Sure.''
</P>
<P>
   There are lucrative contracts in Korea in large part because of
Se Ri Pak, in Australia because of Karrie Webb, and in Sweden
because of Annika Sorenstam.
</P>
<P>
   ``The percentage of our TV revenues had been basically 75
percent domestic and 25 percent foreign,'' said Votaw. ``Today it's
55 percent domestic and 45 percent international.''
</P>
<P>
   The only regret the new commissioner has is that he can't attend
a Bruce Springsteen concert this summer because of an LPGA board
meeting that conflicts with the schedule. The Boss has to attend to
business.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Webb left the farm town of Ayr near the Queensland
coast of Australia to join the LPGA Tour in 1996, she has been a
force. She won rookie of the year honors and hasn't finished out of
the top five in earnings. She entered the LPGA Championship with
five victories this year, 14 in her brief career, and the No. 1
spot on the money list with $941,1984. ``I have always focused,
from a young age, on what I wanted to do,'' said Webb on the eve of
the tournament. ``I dreamed about being out here. I still enjoyed
my teenage years and school years, but I wanted to play golf and to
be in the position I am now.'' She had 13 starts entering the LPGA
Championship _ and 13 finishes in the top 10. ``That's sort of a
goal I set for myself every week,'' said Webb, ``and you always
wonder when the week is going to come and you don't finish in the
top 10. It's not going to last forever.'' Indeed it didn't, as Webb
missed the cut here with 72-72_144 . . . Pat Bradley, who played in
the LPGA Championship at Pleasant Valley CC in Sutton, Mass., in
her rookie season of 1974, is looking forward to returning to the
venue for the LPGA Boston Classic Aug. 5-8. It was the late Cuz
Mingolla who brought the LPGA and PGA to Sutton, and he passed the
baton to his son, Ted, who will preside over this year's event. ``I
am really looking forward to going home,'' said Bradley, a native
of Westford, Mass. ``The players are absolutely going to love it. I
think Junior (Ted) is going to love having us there. Junior's a
smart guy. He knows the right thing to do, and that is bringing us
back.'' . . . Nancy Lopez, who withdrew from the LPGA Championship
to undergo arthroscopic surgery on her right knee, should be able
to return to the golf course in four weeks. Dr. Craig Morgan, who
performed the surgery, told the News Journal of Wilmington, ``The
procedure went well and there were no surprises. She will probably
be able to pick up her clubs in two weeks and be back playing in
about four weeks. She couldn't even walk. It was not like she was
limping around a little bit. She couldn't walk.'' The doctor said
she will eventually need a knee replacement . . . Rosie Jones has
knocked on the door in each of the LPGA's four majors but never won
one. She was locked in a duel to the finish with Hollis Stacy in
the 1984 US Women's Open at Salem (Mass.) CC. But Jones faltered,
bogeying the final hole, and Stacy won the championship for the
second time. She is not convinced that a win at Salem would have
paved the way to more victories. ``I was pretty young,'' said
Jones. ``I was only 24, on the tour two years, and actually the
next week I tied in Rochester and got beat in a playoff. I think
those types of outcomes were the best for me, because I needed to
grow a little bit and become a better golfer and get ready. But
coming down that stretch in the Open at Salem, I was right there
leading or tied for the lead. I got a little too aggressive on the
last hole, got above the hole and pretty much had an impossible
chip. I was young, and probably a little dumb. I have kind of paid
all my dues, sowed all my oats, and made all those beds. I'm ready
to play better golf right now. I'm better prepared for the
challenge.'' She opened with a 64, missing the course record by one
. . . There is little question that the men's US Open will return
to Pinehurst No. 2. David Fay, executive director of the US Golf
Association, said as much last Sunday in published interviews.
``You'd be hard pressed to find any reason to not believe the US
Open will return to Pinehurst No. 2,'' Fay told the News and
Observer in Raleigh, N.C. ``It has been an unqualified success''

   SONOMA, Calif. - It is pretty here. The scenic Pacific coast is
nearby, and Napa Valley is just up the road.
</P>
<P>
   The weather? Gorgeous. The high around the Bay area today is
supposed to be about 72 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it nearly July?
</P>
<P>
   And who can argue the importance of the San Francisco market?
</P>
<P>
   But with so many emerging racetracks seeking NASCAR Winston Cup
races, not to mention established facilities such as Texas Motor
Speedway and Phoenix International Raceway beating the drum for
profitable second-race dates, should NASCAR think twice about being
here?
</P>
<P>
   Sears Point Raceway, the site of today's 112-lap race over a
twisting 10-turn, 1.949-mile layout, and Watkins Glen (N.Y.)
International are the only road courses on NASCAR's crowded
schedule, taking up two spots on a crowded 34-race circuit.
</P>
<P>
   As such, they represent odd configurations in a series defined
by banked ovals and left-hand turns.
</P>
<P>
   Odd enough to remove them from the schedule to make room for
more traditional ovals?
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect if you polled the garage, it would be 50-50 on
whether we should be road racing or not,'' NASCAR executive Mike
Helton said. ``But the same would happen if you polled them about
short tracks or 2{-mile superspeedways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the end of it all is Sears Point and Watkins Glen
offer a style of racing that complements the championship. When a
driver today can win the NASCAR title with all the variables we
throw at them, their credibility as champion is much more
apparent.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: Sears Point and Watkins Glen likely aren't going to
disappear from the NASCAR schedule anytime soon, which won't upset
drivers such as Jeremy Mayfield and Sterling Marlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need the road courses,'' Mayfield said. ``I don't
want to run them 36 times a year, but twice, or even three or four
times, wouldn't be that bad of a deal at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that makes Winston Cup racing so cool, I think, and
makes the championship so important, is the fact we run on every
kind of track there is. If you win the championship or if you
finish high in the points, you've proven you're one of the best
teams in all of racing, not just stock-car racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Marlin has been labeled as someone with a distaste for
road racing, the opposite is true.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're fun to race,'' Marlin said. ``It's not the most
competitive stuff we do and you don't see a lot of passing, but if
you're sitting in the driver's seat of one of these things, it's
pretty cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Sears Point has only been on NASCAR's schedule since 1989, when
it was added to fill a void following the West Coast departure of
Riverside (Calif.) International Raceway (1958-1988), also a
road-racing venue.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins Glen was home to NASCAR races in 1957, 1964 and 1965,
then disappeared until returning in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1965 race, retired driver Buddy Baker, now a television
commentator at several NASCAR races, finished third.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be a Winston Cup champion, you should be able to adapt to
short tracks, big tracks and road courses,'' Baker said. ``Dropping
Sears Point would be like dropping Martinsville or Bristol. I
really think road courses are necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed it when I did it. You get tired of the clones, the
tracks that are exactly alike. You need diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Two-time driving champion Ned Jarrett, also a television
commentator, finished one position ahead of Baker in the '65 race.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some sense, road races were a necessary evil, but in
another sense, it was a special challenge _ and that's what drivers
look forward to,'' Jarrett said. ``I think part of the appeal of
Winston Cup racing is the fact that they run on so many different
types of racetracks. It further tests the skills of a driver and a
team setting up a race car.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other side of the coin, most of the time fans can't see
all the way around the racetrack. But they still come out in big
numbers, so I guess they're willing to accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   Although road racing adds a hefty price tag to the yearly
budget, car owner/driver Ricky Rudd said he thought removing Sears
Point or Watkins Glen would be detrimental to the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a car for the road courses that you don't race
anywhere else, and we're talking $100,000 a car,'' Rudd said. ``But
I would enjoy even more road courses. The feedback I get from fans
is they really like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Car owner Travis Carter, whose driver Jimmy Spencer never has
posted a top-10 finish at Sears Point, also sees the merits of road
courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a business perspective, California is a big state and it
has a lot of people,'' Carter said. ``It's a big market for these
companies that sponsor NASCAR racing. How can you say no to that?
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite honestly, for us, (Sears Point) is a little bit of a
refreshing venue.''
</P>
<P>
   So refreshing NASCAR doesn't seem intent on turning its back on
the pretzel-shaped courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only run on two each year, so it's not a major-type issue
with us,'' said Helton, who in February was tabbed by NASCAR
President Bill France Jr. to take over the organization's
day-to-day operations. ``It's fun and it's different, but we're not
going to be out there looking for a lot more road courses to run
when at the same time you have all the oval opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two a year works well.''
</P>
<P>
   It works well for John Andretti, who finished third in last
year's Sears Point race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fans enjoy it, and I think everybody likes
something different every once in a while,'' Andretti said. ``I
don't know if everyone would like it if, say, half the races were
on road corses. They're not always everybody's favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``But these guys are awfully good racers, period. And the road
courses give you another chance to show what you can do.'' &QL;

GMS PERPLEXED BY DRAFT DAY DILEMMA 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The NBA draft is Wednesday. If you polled general
managers, most would probably vote to cancel it. Without question,
this is the weakest, most unappealing draft in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with big-time players. See any? If you do, call
Jerry Krause, general manager of the Chicago Bulls, who pick first.
That's not to say that players taken out of this draft won't make
good pros; heck, high schoolers are making decent pros these days.
</P>
<P>
   Or, to look at it a different way, when was the last time the
consensus No. 1 pick got cold feet and wanted to return to college?
Maybe Lamar Odom is turned off by the lack of talent in the NBA and
wants to return to the good ol' Atlantic 10.
</P>
<P>
   This is also the year of the point guard, which is a bit like
saying in football that it's the year of the special teams player.
Sure, point guards are important. But they're also plentiful. And
as one scout said of Steve Francis, the acknowledged king of the
point guards, ``I like him, but you never know when he's going to
go Juco on you.''
</P>
<P>
   There hasn't been a draft in recent memory with so few teams
holding No. 1 picks. The Celtics aren't alone here. A staggering
eight teams have no first-round selection. The most envied man on
Wednesday may well be Portland GM Bob Whitsitt, whose team has no
picks. The most pitied man? Atlanta GM Pete Babcock, who has four
first-rounders, the highest of which is 17.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, each first-rounder comes not only with the obligatory
question mark as to talent, but also with at least three years of
guaranteed money. Don't be surprised if Atlanta, Utah, or another
team picking late in the first round such as the Spurs (29) or Heat
(25) passes.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Kevin McHale summed it up best. When asked what he was
going to do with Minnesota's two first-rounders, Nos. 6 and 14, he
said quickly, ``Trade 'em, I hope.'' Not too long ago, those picks
would have been team-builders. Now they can be simply unwanted or
unneeded salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a team-by-team preview of the draft, which will be held
at the MCI Center in Washington. First-round picks are in
parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA (17, 20, 21, 27): After watching the Hawks against the
Knicks, we know what they need: someone with the rather elementary
skill of putting the ball in the basket. The Hawks were easily the
most offensively challenged team we've seen in years. Don't be
surprised if Babcock either trades the pick(s) for a veteran scorer
or selects players willing to accept one-way tickets to Portugal or
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON (none): The best Kentucky player available. That would be
either Wayne Turner, Heshimu Evans, or Scott Padgett, whoever is
available at 55. Jamal Magliore wisely decided to go back to
school.
</P>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE (3): They love Francis, but point guard isn't their
top need. They need an outside scorer to complement the inside game
of their big men. That man may well be Wally Szczerbiak, who has
risen steadily because of terrific workouts and the fact that he's
a true senior.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO (1, 16): You know things could be wild with Krause
holding the No. 1 pick. Will he trade it? Will he take some
Senegalese center? Everyone knows what the Bulls need, but He has
retired. When you average 81 points a game, you need a scorer.
Krause may trade down for multiple picks or a player/pick, but not
too far. He must love being in the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   DALLAS (none): Don Nelson went foreign with his last two
first-rounders (Chris Anstey, Dirk Nowitzki) and traded this year's
for another (Steve Nash). He won't pick until 36 and needs a power
forward with A.C. Green, Gary Trent, and Samaki Walker all entering
free agency.
</P>
<P>
   DENVER (18): Their lotto pick goes to Toronto, but they do have
No. 18, which ought to thrill Dan Issel. They might try to get a
point guard, with Nick Van Exel iffy to re-sign. But all the decent
ones will be gone by then.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT (none): They're almost as bad off (or well off) as
Boston. The Pistons pick 54th overall and will take what they feel
is the best player on the board. That could be anyone.
</P>
<P>
   GOLDEN STATE (10): Bimbo Coles is the starting point guard. Any
questions? The guy they really want is Gary Payton, but he's taken
(for now). Someone such as William Avery or Jason Terry might be
there, but crack GM Garry St. Jean would rather watch the sun set
on Cape Cod Bay this summer knowing he has a vet in that spot. Did
we hear the words ``sign and trade''?
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON (22): Matt Maloney and Cuttino Mobley are the point
guards. Any questions? No one they find at 22 will be as good,
another sad commentary on the draft.
</P>
<P>
   INDIANA (26): They might as well pass. Their one glaring
weakness, athleticism, could be solved by attending an amateur
slam-dunk contest. Then there's Rik Smits and his Royal Doulton
feet, but try finding a center at 15, let alone 26.
</P>
<P>
   LA CLIPPERS (4): Darrick Martin is the starting point guard. Any
questions? They're a lock to take Baron Davis unless Rick Pitino
can sweet-talk them into claiming Kenny Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   LA LAKERS (23): They solved one need with the hiring of Phil
Jackson. But he has only a couple more rings than Kurt Rambis. The
Lakers need a backup to Shaq, but more critically, a power forward
or point guard. Jerry West has done well drafting low, but even he
may not be able to draw blood from this old rock.
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI (25): Pat Riley views the NBA draft the same way he views
passing kidney stones. But the playoffs exposed the Heat's lack of
scoring, and their backcourt is suspect with Tim Hardaway (age,
knees) and Voshon Lenard (doghouse). One interesting name to note:
Devean George of Division 3 Augsburg (Minn.). He's a scorer and he
played well at Portsmouth.
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (none): They are offering two players nobody wants _
Armon Gilliam and Chris Gatling _ to move up. Don't bet on it.
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA (6, 14): McHale took his coaching staff, fishing
lures, and coolers away for the weekend to look for the walleyes.
And maybe a point guard, too. At No. 6, he could get a decent point
guard such as Andre Miller. But he likes Francis, as do most
general managers. There are all kind of rumors with free
agent-to-be Terrell Brandon at the center.
</P>
<P>
   NEW JERSEY (none): They finally solved their coaching situation.
Now they can get psyched for the 34th pick. They'll be looking for
the best big body, with Jayson Williams (leg), Jim McIlvaine
(shoulder), and Rony Seikaly (foot, karma) all hurt last year.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (15): Charlie Ward and Chris Childs are the point
guards. Any questions? It looks as though New York will have to
live with the two for a while; who would want them?
</P>
<P>
   ORLANDO (none): Their concerns are what they have and whether to
make an effort to keep it. They also have three first-rounders next
year, which they might package with one of their players to move
up. What do they need? Same as a lot of teams: a reliable point
guard, since Penny Hardaway doesn't want to play there and Darrell
Armstrong is what he is _ a good sixth man. Someone such as Turner
might end up here if they do nothing and choose 36th.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (none): Gee, do you think they need another scorer?
They might get one at 47, but whether that lad can light it up in
the NBA is another matter entirely.
</P>
<P>
   PHOENIX (9): Jerry Colangelo said it best: ``We need to get
strong and athletic, like (Antonio) McDyess.'' The Suns couldn't
re-sign him and they keep looking for another like him. They're
said to be interested in Penny and are dangling Rex Chapman, as if
he might actually bring something.
</P>
<P>
   PORTLAND (none): It's hard to imagine Whitsitt, nicknamed
``Trader Bob,'' sitting by idly on draft night. The Blazers have
depth and talent, and that could translate into some kind of deal.
Whitsitt likes high schoolers; would he trade for a shot at
Jonathan Bender, who may crack the top five? He's also said to be
fielding offers for the disgruntled Damon Stoudamire, maybe the
most overrated player in the league.
</P>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO (none): They could use a point guard to back up Jason
Williams, and Turner would be a good fit here at No. 45 because he
doesn't look to shoot and can defend.
</P>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO (29): Why bother? Just bring everyone back and see
whether they can continue what they've started. If I were Gregg
Popovich, I'd look for the closest FOT (Friend Of Tim) and draft
him.
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE (13): The Sonics need toughness and backcourt help.
Among the names you'll see are Ron Artest, James, Terry (a Seattle
native), and Jumaine Jones of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO (5, 12): Everyone is calling the Raptors; teams that
want to move up and teams that want to trade down. If nothing
happens, don't be surprised if GM Glen Grunwald goes for high
schooler Bender, who is wowing a lot of people in workouts.
</P>
<P>
   UTAH (19, 24, 28): No surprises here. Think they need some youth
in the backcourt? Or some muscle in the middle? Scott Layden will
have trouble finding much of anything, but he's been great at
getting help in the second round (Shandon Anderson, Bryon Russell).
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (7): Terry Davis and Ben Coleman masqueraded as
centers last season. Think they need help there? Think they'll find
it here? They'd be better off exhuming Wes Unseld; he's done such a
masterful job in the front office all these years. Mitch Richmond
and Calbert Cheaney are free agents? Think they need help there?
There may be someone who can shoot available at No. 7.

YUGOSLAVIAN IS THE CENTER OF ATTENTION  
 BUT RADOJEVIC LACKS EXPERIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are no secrets in the NBA draft. Every team may hope to
find that player everybody else missed, but it rarely happens.
</P>
<P>
   Even Aleksandar Radojevic, who slipped out of the Yugoslavian
army's grasp by playing basketball at Barton County Community
College in Kansas, couldn't escape the long reach of the NBA's
talent spies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to make this massive drive to see him play in Great
Bend, Kansas,'' said Dave Babcock, scouting director of the
Milwaukee Bucks and a former coach at Arizona Western junior
college. ``It was classic JUCO. They introduced the players, and
then they introduced the coach (Ryan Cross).
</P>
<P>
   ``He's kind of a big guy. His shirt tail wasn't quite tucked in.
And when he came out on the floor, he was carrying one of those Big
Gulp sodas.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was worth the trip. There were a few big gulps in store
for Babcock as he watched Barton County's star player, the 7-foot-3
Radojevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played the point of their press, had great footwork, ran
well and had a nice shooting touch,'' Babcock said. ``It's amazing
the stuff he can do facing the basket for a guy who's 7-2 or
whatever he is. The big question is his lack of strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of Radojevic's sleight build _ he weighs about 245
pounds _ and style, he could play forward at the start of his pro
career, despite his height.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Babcock figured he was watching a player who wouldn't
be in the NBA for at least another year anyway. Radojevic signed a
letter of intent to play for Ohio State. But the NCAA ruled the
22-year-old former water polo player from Montenegro ineligible
because he had played a total of 19 minutes in four games for
Papagou, a professional club in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He found out about a week before players had to declare
themselves for the draft,'' said Marc Cornstein, who represents
Radojevic and other European players. ``He's the biggest enigma,
both literally and figuratively, in the draft.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Radojevic set out on a cross-country tour of NBA teams for
individual workouts, including one for the Suns on June 17. In all,
he worked out for 16 teams, including the Chicago Bulls, who have
the No. 1 overall pick but might trade down in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on, I saw a mock draft on the Internet that had him
going 36th,'' Cornstein said. ``We saved that just to remind
ourselves where he started on this journey. I'm an optimist. I
thought that when word got out, his stock would rise. I didn't
expect it to rise as much as it has.''
</P>
<P>
   Radojevic is likely to go somewhere near the middle of the first
round after some impressive workouts.
</P>
<P>
   It's quite a leap, considering he only began playing basketball
when he was 16. He grew to 7-feet by the time he was 19 and was
measured at 7-2} recently. The plan was to spend two years at
Barton County, then develop further at a major university before
embarking on an NBA career.
</P>
<P>
   Radojevic said that was his preference, but his timetable had to
change because of the NCAA's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this is a huge step,'' Radojevic said in a telephone
conversation from Salt Lake City, where he worked out for the Jazz
Wednesday. ``I planned to go to Ohio State. The experience in
junior college was good, but there was no competition. What I did
in junior college, it doesn't matter because I didn't play anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm somebody nobody in the NBA knows. I didn't play in any big
league so I'm new to all these people. I have to prove myself.''
</P>
<P>
   At least Radojevic figures he'll be playing in the NBA. If not
for the game, he might have wound up in the war in Kosovo. A
Serbian, he grew up on the Montenegro coast and worried that he
would be drafted into the army.
</P>
<P>
   ``They couldn't come here and pick me up,'' he said, laughing.
``If I had been in Yugoslavia at the time, I would have been
drafted.''
</P>
<P>
   A thought which horrifies Cornstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 7-foot-3 guy makes a pretty good target,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Radojevic, whose father died a few years ago, said he plans to
bring his mother and the rest of his family to the United States
once he's established. He makes no secret of his disgust for what
happened in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a situation bad for all people,'' he said. ``It doesn't
matter if they were Albanian or Serbian, it was bad for all of
them. Everybody suffered.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are idiot politicians in every country, and people are
suffering because of them. It's wrong. A lot of people died for
nothing. I'm sad for the people, but not the politicians. They're
all idiots.''
</P>
<P>
   One Yugoslavian, and fellow Serbian, whom Radojevic admires
greatly is Sacramento Kings center Vlade Divac.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to work hard to break his records,'' Radojevic said.
``A lot of kids can learn from his example, especially off the
court. He's a great person.''
</P>
<P>
   But not necessarily Radojevic's role mode.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to be like Hakeem Olajuwon,'' he said. ``And to
pass like Arvydas Sabonis. That would be a great combination, eh?''
</P>
<P>
   One worth the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Booth, 6-11, Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   Athletic, but only 220 pounds. But he's ``long'' as the scouts
like to say for players with long arms and legs, who can get off
the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's left-handed, and a good shot blocker,'' said Suns Player
Personnel Director Dick Van Arsdale. ``He has a pretty decent
shooting touch.''
</P>
<P>
   Evan Eschmeyer, 7-2, Northwestern.
</P>
<P>
   Overachiever and a hard worker. Not very athletic. Thus, typical
of this year's centers.
</P>
<P>
   Others to watch: Tim Young, 7-1, Stanford; Todd McCulloch, 7-0,
Washington. &QL;

BLUEPRINT FOR MERCURY SUCCESS  
 PLAYERS CITE TEAM EFFORT IN WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ There was something foundational about the
Mercury's 66-60 win over the Detroit Shock on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike its previous victories, over struggling Cleveland and
inexperienced Washington, this was more controlled and repeatable.
In leading from 14:24 of the first half on, Phoenix (3-4) looked
like a team that found a clue amidst the ashes of an 88-72 loss to
Charlotte on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we see how we're capable of playing,'' said Lisa Harrison,
who steadied a lineup without Clarissa Davis-Wrightsil for almost
all of the second half. ``We were really embarrassed last game. It
helps our confidence to come out and show what we can do and to
play together as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, the Mercury played with patience for the first time
all season, shooting 51.6 percent in the first half when it led
35-22 before dropping back to 37-32 at intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when the Shock (4-4) found a higher defensive gear in the
second half and Phoenix went just 6-for-27 (22.2 percent) from the
field, the Mercury kept grinding on both ends of the court and
converted 11-of-14 free throws in the final 1:43.
</P>
<P>
   In losing before 7,651 at The Palace and a national television
audience, Detroit falls to 0-4 all-time vs. Phoenix, a sore point
with the Shock staff of former Mercury Nancy Lieberman-Cline and
former Mercury assistant Steve Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like the Wizard of Oz,'' said Lieberman-Cline, in her
second season as Detroit coach/general manager. ``We don't have
courage, we don't have heart and sometimes we don't have a brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix was lacking all those qualities against Charlotte, which
lost to Detroit, 75-69, Tuesday, but finally appears to have bought
into the four-pass offense that ``lets us see what the weak side
looks like,'' Coach Cheryl Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight we played like a team, and when we play like a team we
look great,'' said point guard Michele Timms, who held her
Australian mate Sandy Brondello three below her 16.6 scoring
average. ``We know that it's just a matter of us putting our
individual needs aside and deciding that we're going to do this as
a team. Team overrides the individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller credited Timms with her best game of the season. She and
the other Australian Mercury point, Kristi Harrower, had 5 assists
apiece as Phoenix had a 17-9 lead in that category. And just as
significantly, a 35-25 rebounding edge including a game-high 13 by
Jennifer Gillom, who with 17 points posted her third double-double.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury was outscored in the paint, 30-24, for the seventh
straight time but by taking better shots stymied Detroit in
transition and for the first time this season had an advantage,
7-5, in fast-break points.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, we need to focus on our defense, and that's
going to help our offense,'' Harrison said. ``And being more
patient in our offense and not thinking one person has to get the
ball and go 1-on-1. That's not going to work for us, for us to
solely focus on Jen and for her to carry us through the season. We
need to get help from everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the 6-foot Harrison, who played 20 of her 28 minutes in the
second half after Davis-Wrightsil, with 14 first-half points,
cracked her right knee on the floor. She finished with 9 points, 3
rebounds, 2 assists and a steal and made three of the stretch free
throws.
</P>
<P>
   And 6-8 Maria Stepanova, playing 19 minutes because Marlies
Askamp was in foul trouble, who had 6 blocks to go with 6 rebounds
and 3 points. The Russian is up to 14 blocks (2.00 average) and
pressing Sacramento's Yolanda Griffith and Charlotte's Vicky
Bullett for the league lead.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Dominique Canty, with a team-high 16 points off the
bench, kept Detroit within three, 55-52, with 3:33 remaining. But
Astou Ndiaye missed an open layup off a feed from Canty, then the
Mercury refused to crack in its parade to the line, going 19-for-23
overall.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit guard Jennifer Azzi sat out a second consecutive game
due to a left hamstring injury. Starting forward Cindy Brown
suffered a possible fractured tailbone with 5:13 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury is more than halfway through its seven-game road
trip with a 2-2 record and plays Monday at Cleveland. &QL;

LEAGUE LOSING GROUND IN FINANCIAL DRAG RACE 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The world's latest batch of teenage millionaires took
the giant step into the deep green sea with Saturday's amateur
draft inside the Vault. For those new to National Hockey League
economics, the collective bargaining agreement between owners and
labor ``limits'' this year's first-round picks to a maximum annual
salary of $1.025 million.
</P>
<P>
   These golden-bladed wannabes _ we can't even call them rookies
yet _ have played a key role in the high spike in league salaries
ever since the CBA took hold in January 1995. The owners wanted a
salary ``drag,'' part of the reason they locked out the players in
the fall of '94, and were convinced that the rookie cap would bring
the desired slowdown. It hasn't happened. The drag has turned into
a cash cudgel for the players.
</P>
<P>
   Primo draft picks aren't the entire reason for runaway pay, but
they unquestionably have driven up the price of lower-end talent.
When the 18-year-old first-rounder with 0-0_0 next to his name
pockets a guarantee of $3 million-plus over three years, every guy
with a year or two in the league, even if his career totals read
0-0_1, looks at the entry-level cash grab for some leverage.
</P>
<P>
   For example, what do you expect Hal Gill will want from the
Bruins? The towering defenseman made $410,000 last season as Ray
Bourque's blue line partner. The 207th pick in the '93 draft, Gill
in two seasons has shaped into a respectable, reliable presence.
His pride and his pay expanded considerably when the great Jaromir
Jagr identified him as the toughest guy to go around in the league.
He'll take that endorsement to the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Gill undoubtedly will look at the pay for this year's
first-round picks as a payroll template. The Bruins won't like
hearing that, and will dismiss it by pointing to the ``207'' next
to Gill's name. But rest assured any club picking in the first
round Saturday _ especially those selecting after, say, No. 12 _
would have been glad to leave FleetStreet knowing it got another
Gill.
</P>
<P>
   The CBA doesn't expire until the spring of 2004. Until then,
owners will have to live with the deal they cut in '94 and then
quickly extended to its current termination date. The desired drag
hasn't materialized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we've gotten it, but it hasn't been enough,'' said NHL
commissioner Gary Bettman. ``The first two years of the CBA, it was
working fine _ revenues were increasing faster than salaries. The
last two years it has been the the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   So where does it go from here?
</P>
<P>
   ``Either teams will adjust, which they have the ability to do,
at least theoretically under the CBA,'' said Bettman, ``or when we
get to the next round of bargaining, we will fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a certain emphasis and conviction in Bettman's voice
when he said, ``We will fix it.'' It wasn't quite Nikita Khruschev
declaring, ``We will bury you,'' but it had weight. It sounded as
if another lockout loomed on the horizon. Is that what he meant?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' said Bettman. ``We will fix it. Whatever it takes to fix
it. The league from a revenue standpoint has never been stronger.
Our revenues the last five years have grown a half-billion dollars
a year. We're not having a revenue problem. We're having an
expense-side problem. And any well-run business has to address that
when the appropriate time comes.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In case you missed it, the NHL decided last Monday to adopt
four-on-four play as a five-minute tie-breaker next season. When
the game is tied after 60 minutes, both clubs will receive a point
in the standings. A third point will be awarded to a club that
scores when the two sides are skating one man down during overtime.
Sorry, but I can't get too excited. It's a gimmick. It only
encourages clubs to play it safe, put 1 point in the bank, and then
let it all hang out for the five minutes. How about no points for a
tie? Let's see how they play when they both teams know they'll walk
with nothing at the end of the night . . . Outgoing Tampa owner Art
Williams, the same guy who last year told us No. 1 draft pick
Vincent LeCavalier would be ``the Michael Jordan of hockey,''
torched a deal last week that had top Czech goalie prospect Roman
Turek joining the Bolts from Dallas. New Lightning boss Rick Dudley
cut the deal, but Williams kiboshed it, pointing to the fact that
he technically still owned the club and didn't want to be on the
hook for Turek's salary if the sale wasn't finalized. What's going
on here? Williams has agreed to sell to Bill Davidson. The right
thing to do would have been for Williams to ask Davidson to
guarantee Turek's pay. Instead, he voided it and the Stars then
flipped Turek to the Blues for a third-round pick (something
Williams could have done, if his doomsday scenario came true). It's
time for this deal to get done before the ongoing joke that is
Tampa becomes the next club headed to the courtroom . . . Larry
Kelly, ex- of North Quincy and now the Stars' fine public relations
director, took one for the team Saturday night when the Stars
clinched the Cup. He cut his hand while lugging the Conn Smythe
Trophy (playoff MVP) with recipient Joe Nieuwendyk. Dallas doctors
reportedly have suggested a well-deserved month-long soaking in
Cape Cod Bay as the cure . . . You can look it up: Phil Housley
received one vote in the Norris Trophy balloting as the league's
top defenseman . . . The Flyers left Luke Richardson available in
Friday's exansion draft, but the Thrashers weren't biting. Philly
GM Bob Clarke says he'll renew attempts to trade the former Oiler
blue liner, whom he brought to Broad Street for a five-year deal
worth $12.5 million. ``For whatever reason,'' said Clarke,
``(coach) Roger (Neilson) doesn't like the way he plays _ it's not
the player's fault.'' Richardson isn't the fastest skater out
there, but he can play the position. Philly's best chance to move
him will be to work out a pay split with the club that acquires
him.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Every coach's dream: When Ivan Novoseltsev recently came to
contract terms with the Panthers, he phoned Mark Hunter, his coach
last season at Sarnia, and told him that he would send him and his
wife anywhere in the world on vacation _ a thank you for the help .
. . The Thrashers finally put some names to their roster Friday,
but they still don't have a coach. General manager Don Waddell has
a candidate or two to interview _ Buffalo assistant Don Lever
possibly among them _ before making his decision . . . Speculation
grows that the Canadiens will make a serious pitch to Bob Gainey,
hoping that he'll return to Montreal to fill the presidency vacated
by Ron Corey. Now that the Stars have won, he'll never be able to
accomplish more in Dallas. And the shattered Habs couldn't be much
worse than they are today . . . Now that Mario Lemieux is the new
owner of the Pittsburgh Penguins _ effective July 16, with a key
assist from the US Bankruptcy Court on Thursday _ how long before
he begins to bellyache about the runaway salaries? Team Lemieux and
SMG hammered out a new lease at the Igloo late Friday night. Under
the new deal, the Penguins will pay some $1.9 million in rent per
season, a reduction of better than two-thirds from the $6
million-$7 million they were paying before the former ownership
went bust. The deal runs out in 2004, by which time Lemieux and
crew hope to have a new building . . . The NHL Award ceremonies
televised on ESPN Thursday night hit a new low for poor taste. What
an unmitigated disgrace. Comedienne Cathy Jones played a '90s
version of Mae West, packing her painful, embarrassing set with a
boatload of sexual innuendo (not the least of which was a cheap,
prurient play on Michael Peca's last name). Hey, soft porn has its
place, I guess, but Jones should work somewhere she can charge 25
cents a peep. Someone in the league should have had the decency to
pull the plug, followed by an immediate offer of resignation . . .
If I'm a Sabres fan, sure, I'm upset that Brett Hull's goal was
allowed to stand as the Cup winner. But I'm equally upset that the
Sabres' two best defensemen, Alexei Zhitnik and Richard Smehlik,
were on the ice and did absolutely nothing to prevent the goal . .
. It's a technical point, but one worth making: Mike Smith wasn't
fired in Toronto _ his contract was up and he couldn't see eye to
eye with Leafs boss Ken Dryden about the job definition of GM. ``He
pretends to listen, but he doesn't,'' said Smith. ``He just looks
like he's listening.'' . . . Colorado's Chris Drury picked up
$100,000 along with that Calder Trophy as the NHL's rookie of the
year. The former Boston University center, who made $735,000 this
past season, was drained after his first day in the Avalanche camp
last September. Coach Bob Hartley called him into his office and
told him that things would have to change the next day or he'd be
assigned to Hershey. ``That kind of woke me up,'' said Drury . . .
Former Bruins coach Brian Sutter will be back behind the Calgary
bench next season after getting his salary bumped to about
$325,000. He also will have the one-year agreement extended if his
hard-working Flames clinch a playoff berth . . . Peca on Dallas
forward Jere Lehtinen, who was named the Selke winner Thursday
night as the league's best checking forward: ``The Modanos,
Nieuwendyks, and Hulls get the publicity, but Lehtinen makes that
team go. He contributes to a lot of wins, often more than the other
guys do.'' . . . Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock is convinced the league
is on the brink of a new era, with a true emphasis on offense.
``Everything's going to be over the top, long bombs,'' said
Hitchcock, predicting the end of the dreaded trap. Here's hoping
his clairvoyance turns out to be the equal of his coaching.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Equally amazing as Ray Bourque's tenure with the Bruins _
celebrated at the draft Saturday _ is the 19-year relationship he
has maintained with his agent, Steve Freyer. In an age when
high-profile players change agents virtually between shifts _ which
could be a reflection of both sides of the equation _ Bourque has
had Freyer at his side from almost day one. He's been as religious
about his representation as he has been about his conditioning.
``What you find out about Ray early on is that's he's all about
loyalty and dedication,'' said Freyer. ``He's loyal to his friends,
his family, me. That's his view of the world. He talks about his
genes being part of the player he is. I think loyalty for him is
genetic, too.'' . . . One last Bourque note: His dad, Ray Sr.,
still has the rocking chair that his now-famous son built for him
in high school. ``Yeah,'' said Ray Sr., reached at his home last
week in Moncton, New Brunswick. ``We even went out and got a new
cover put on it recently, so it'll be nice when Ray comes to
visit.'' Twenty years ago, the elder Bourque was shocked when he
heard the Bruins selected his son in the amateur draft. ``I said,
`Ray, why didn't you tell me?' '' said Ray Sr., who learned the
news the next day on the radio. ``He told me he couldn't tell me,
because I asked him not to tell me. I guess I did. I'd been getting
so many calls, and whenever a reporter would call, I'd go on and on
about whatever he'd told me. He got mad. I guess it embarrassed
him. Finally I told him, `OK, don't tell me anything.' So he
didn't.'' . . . Bettman, when asked about the high cost of
attending an NHL games, makes note of the high cost of seeing a
Broadway show, a movie, an NFL game, a baseball game, or an NBA
game. ``The fact is,'' he said, ``it's something that all of us in
entertainment need to be focused on.'' . . . Had the Thrashers not
hired Les Jackson away from Dallas as their assistant GM, he would
be in line for a Cup ring now that the Stars are the champs. Noting
that, Dr. Harvey Schiller, the Thrasher president, ordered Jackson
a Rolex watch to commemorate the win.

OLD TRIESTE CAN'T GO FOR GOLD 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

   BOSTON _ The recent retirement of Silver Charm leaves the
handicap division up for grabs. The presumptive nominee coming into
the season, Silver Charm was sent to stud following a string of
dull races. Left standing are Victory Gallop, Behrens, and Real
Quiet, any one of which could win the Eclipse Award. Unfortunately,
Old Trieste, arguably the most brilliant of the group, will not get
a chance to show his stuff in Sunday's $1 million Hollywood Gold
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   A 4-year-old son of former Horse of the Year A.P. Indy, Old
Trieste has been plagued by bad feet, and an abcess turned up
Tuesday, causing trainer Mike Puype to scratch him from the Gold
Cup, in which he would have been favored.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was facing backwards in his stall, and I knew something was
wrong,'' said Puype, who trains Old Trieste for owner Gary Bisantz.
``We took his temperature, and it was 103 degrees.''
</P>
<P>
   The same problem kept Old Trieste out of the Strub Stakes over
the winter, and his only start this year was a dominating 7-length
tally under regular rider Chris McCarron in the Californian at
Hollywood May 29.
</P>
<P>
   Old Trieste has a career record of 11-6-1-1, and he has won four
straight stakes since stopping after setting the pace in the 1998
Kentucky Derby. A noted front-runner, he appears to have a rare
combination of speed and stamina, but he is going to have to run
more often to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a temporary setback,'' said Bisantz, who now will point
Old Trieste toward the Pacific Classic at Del Mar in August and the
Breeders' Cup Classic at Gulfstream Park in November.
</P>
<P>
   The scratch leaves Real Quiet, trained by Bob Baffert, the
Richard Mandella-trained pair of Puerto Madero and Malek, and
Budroyale, to contest the Gold Cup. The four-horse field is so
competitive that the odds range merely from 7-5 to 7-2, with Real
Quiet 7-5, Puerto Madero 2-1, Budroyale 5-2, and Malek 7-2.
</P>
<P>
   Like the race itself, the division is wide open. At least, that
is, until Old Trieste's feet heal.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Great Barrington Fair, which originally applied for 10
thoroughbred racing dates from Sept. 10-19, will not race this
year, and owner Henry Vara has put the 56-acre property up for
sale. Great Barrington ran 20 dates last year but suffered because
some of the programs conflicted with racing at Saratoga. Vara
estimates that he lost $1.15 million on racing, and the final straw
came in May when local residents rejected a referendum to allow
Great Barrington to bring in simulcasting. ``It's a sad day,'' Vara
told The Berkshire Eagle. ``I'm unhappy to do it. But, financially,
I just can't carry on.'' In 1995, a tornado destroyed the
grandstand, but the facility was rebuilt, and racing was conducted
there the past two years. Vara is reportedly seeking $3 million for
the grounds . . . For the first time, Baffert will campaign at a
New York meeting. He has asked for six stalls at Saratoga, which
opens July 27, and will stable Real Quiet there. Baffert, the king
of the Midwest and West Coast, is 0 for 9 in New York and 0 for 1
in Boston, as Real Quiet finished third to Behrens in the MassCap
at Suffolk . . . Sunday, Churchill Downs will honor Silver Charm,
who won the 1997 Kentucky Derby. The 5-year-old will parade before
the grandstand and gallop past the Twin Spires. He will then go to
the winner's circle, where he will be presented with a silver
basket of carrots, apples, and mints.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Harry Mangurian, who owned the Celtics in the early '80s and was
a noted thoroughbred owner, is retiring from racing at the age of
75. Mangurian intends to disperse his stock, including 275 in-foal
mares, and sell Mockingbird Farm, which sits on 1,100 acres in
Ocala, Fla. ``Mr. Mangurian has always been a hands-on type owner,
but it was getting to where he was spending less and less time in
Ocala,'' said Mark Casse, director of operations at Mockingbird.
``That was one thing he got out of his involvement in this
industry, the enjoyment. But he is going to be spending all of his
time in Fort Lauderdale now, and he decided it was time to
disperse.'' The mares will be sold Oct. 10, with the yearlings and
2-year-olds sold subsequently, at the Ocala sales. The stallions
will be sold privately . . . A reminder that Suffolk Downs is open
every day during the summer for simulcasting, with admission and
preferred parking free. ``Trackside at Suffolk Downs,'' hosted by
publicist T.D. Thornton, also continues Saturdays at 11 a.m. on
WESX (1230). Live racing resumes Sept. 25.

   Yagli, winner of the Manhattan Handicap at Belmont June 5 and
currently the top turf horse in the US, will race in the King
George VI and Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes at Ascot July 24. The
King George is the first race in the nine-race Emirates World
Series Racing Championship, which also includes the Breeders' Cup
Turf and offers a $1 million bonus. ``We're going in that
direction; we want to give it a try,'' said Bill Mott, who trains
Yagli, a son of Jade Hunter, for Allen Paulson. ``Of course, he
still has to be coming up to the race well. But if he trains on
schedule, it's our decision to go. It would be a real feather in
our cap to win it. There's not much in the US this summer that we'd
be missing, and we'd be going for a purse that's nearly $1 million.
It's a very prestigious race, and we should be meeting the best
turf horses in the world.'' . . . Charismatic, who fractured his
left front leg while trying to win the Triple Crown in the Belmont
and was subsequently retired, is recovering nicely two weeks after
surgery. ``He's a very good patient,'' said trainer D. Wayne Lukas.
``He's doing better than we could have hoped. He's bearing weight
on that leg very well. He's not showing stress at all from the
whole deal. He's stabilized well. The most critical part is behind
us.'' Charismatic no longer needs medication, and he will remain in
his Belmont stall for 60 days . . . Baffert has a top 2-year-old
filly named Chilukki, who broke the 4 1/2-furlong track record at
Churchill Downs by running :51 April 28. The daughter of Cherokee
Run, who is now 2 for 2, is working sensationally for the Debutante
Stakes at Churchill June 27. Chilukki recently zipped 5 furlongs in
:59 4/5, which caused Baffert's jaw to drop. ``I've never had a
2-year-old quite like her,'' he said. ``Both Chilukki and
Silverbulletday are in a league of their own. They've just come
from another planet or something.''

X GAMES SPONSORS COVET GEN-YERS  
 NEW STRATEGIES HOPE TO REACH SAVVY YOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CRAIG MORGAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Maybe the Marines should update their slogan to
reflect their current recruiting base: ``The Few, The Body-Pierced,
The Marines.'' Sure it's a radical departure from the past, but so
is the entire approach today's marketers are taking toward a
previously overlooked demographic _ youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old advertising belief was that youths were not very savvy
consumers and couldn't be reached,'' said Howard McNally, president
of transaction services for AT&AMP;T. ``But what we've realized is that
they're extremely savvy and astute. Whether that's something new or
we just figured it out I can't tell you, but we're trying things we
never would have tried in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those is sponsoring the X Games, ESPN's 5-year-old
``olympics of alternative sports,'' currently running in San
Francisco. The X Games are a montage of individual-based sports
such as skysurfing, street luging, in-line skating and stunt
bicycling. ESPN's target audience is 12- to 24-year-old males, but
two-thirds of the attendees (233,000 last year in San Diego) are 21
or younger and 70 percent are male, according to Performance
Research of Newport, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not really after the athletes at the X Games because
they have their own sponsors and are making a lot of money,'' said
Lt. Col. Jeffrey Sammons, a public information officer with the
Marine Corps Recruiting Command. ``We're after the audience.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, the Marines and 13 other sponsors paid ESPN a total of $22
million for multimedia ad packages that include commercials, online
advertising, signage at the games and a booth in the X Games
interactive village where corporations are free to hawk their
wares. Six primary sponsors paid $2 million each while the rest
paid about $1 million each.
</P>
<P>
   So while X Games athletes compete for a share of the
comparatively low $1 million in total prize money, sponsors are
after a much larger pot of gold _ the estimated $100 billion spent
by U.S. teens each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a huge amount of disposable income,'' McNally said.
``Each kid spends more than $100 a month. It's just a matter of
maturity and good sense on our part that we're finally trying to
tap this market.''
</P>
<P>
   Tapping it is easier said than done, however. According to most
companies, the youth market is both wary and cynical.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're tired of being talked down to and overcommercialized.
They want to be treated with respect,'' said John Harris, a
spokesman for X Games sponsor Mountain Dew, which uses skysurfing
and other extreme sports in its commercials. ``Our ad campaign has
been very successful with this group because we've never tried to
be something we're not, but it's a real challenge to stay relevant
with these consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Current advertising no-nos include commercials that depict
Generation Y as outlandish or brash. Research has found kids are
tired of that notion. Companies are also in constant fear of
appearing too corporate, a faux pas that could induce negative
responses to their `exploitative' products.
</P>
<P>
   Adidas, which only became a sponsor when Nike dropped out two
years ago, has used only about half its signage at the X Games, an
ESPN spokesman said. Since the company was not part of the original
Games, it doesn't want to be seen as taking advantage of the X
Games' financial possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   But savvy or not, the nose-pierced, sideburn-sporting, knit cap
and baggy shorts-wearing set is being watched very closely. And
since a Nielsen Media Research study has found that kids watch less
television than adults, the X Games give advertisers a variety of
ways to reach a concentrated group of young people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a direct bull's eye for a demographic these companies
are dying to reach,'' said Chris Stiepock, ESPN's X Games director
of marketing and communications.
</P>
<P>
   The interactive village is a prime example with its rows of
booths.

sponsorship increased awareness of 1-800-CALL-ATT. A 1996
Performance Research Survey also revealed that 92 percent of game
attendees remembered Mountain Dew was a sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   But the real goal, McNally said, is for companies to develop
product loyalty with consumers _ in AT&AMP;T's case, those who will
soon be paying the phone bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to tell this story because it epitomizes the way we've
had to change our thinking,'' McNally said. ``We were discussing
what kinds of ads we wanted to run, and the head of our advertising
says to me, `Mr. McNally, if you want to reach the urban youth,
your advertising has to be cool and you, Mr. McNally, are not
cool.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Before when ads came up, a bunch of old execs would gather
round and give their impressions _ but his point was, who are we to
decide what's cool? We have no idea what's cool. Now I show the ads
to my daughter before they ever see the light of day.''
</P>
<P>
   The research gets far more complex than that, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do a lot of youth attitude-tracking surveys . . .'' Sammons
said. ``What we've found in the overwhelming majority is they want
to belong to something larger than themselves, they want to be held
to higher standards, they want an opportunity to lead and they want
something challenging.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I just told you are things the Marine Corps
promises. The X Games just give us a chance to reach young men and
women with that message.'' &QL;

BIG PLANS FOR LITTLE E

 RACING NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ When it was decided that Dale Earnhardt Jr. would
enter five Winston Cup races this year to prepare for his official
rookie campaign next season, New Hampshire International Speedway
was selected as one of the venues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those flat tracks,'' the 24-year-old driver said
Wednesday, ``where it's really difficult to make the cars turn in
the corners.''
</P>
<P>
   The way Earnhardt figured it, it was better to learn something
new at an unfamiliar setting than to learn nothing at all by
turning laps at a familiar track.
</P>
<P>
   That explained why Earnhardt was on the 1-mile NHIS oval for a
test session in his No. 8 Budweiser Chevrolet Monte Carlo. He came
to gain some local knowledge of NHIS in preparation for his second
Winston Cup race, the Jiffy Lube 300 July 11. He will attempt to
qualify also for Winston Cup events in Michigan, Richmond, and
Atlanta before turning his attention to the series full time next
season as primary driver for his father, seven-time champion Dale
Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really adapted well to most of the tracks we've tested
at,'' crew chief Tony Eury Sr. said. ``He was pretty fast here,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Since capturing the 1998 championship of the NASCAR Busch
Series, ``Little E'' as he's been nicknamed, has been on a fast
track to Winston Cup stardom. That was evident in May when he made
his Winston Cup debut in Charlotte by qualifying eighth-fastest and
finishing 16th in the Coca-Cola 600.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy,'' said Earnhardt, referring to the fans' wild
reaction after he qualified faster than his father. ``I was
surprised at how the race fans were as happy and as excited.
Everybody was pumped.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, by all accounts, a successful debut. And while Earnhardt
has focused much of his attention on the buildup for next season,
he hasn't lost sight of defending his Busch Series title this
season. After 16 races, Earnhardt holds a 64-point lead over Matt
Kenseth, 2,264-2,200, entering Sunday's Lysol 200 at Watkins Glen,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   How has he managed to juggle the circuits?
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been that difficult,'' he said. ``The team's been
adapting well and they don't mind the extra load or the hard work,
but that's been cool. I was worried about that, because I was
thinking, `Man, we might get behind on the (Busch) car.' But
they've stuck with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can handle driving and driving and driving, or flying here
and there, meeting this guy or that, shaking these hands, or
signing this and that; I can handle all that, man. If the cars look
good and everybody's pumped about going racing, that excites me.
And I can go handle everything else. I was just worried maybe some
other areas would suffer and fall apart from it and then
everybody's morale would fall, but that hasn't been the case.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Labonte, winner of last week's NASCAR Winston Cup race at
Pocono, Pa., will go for his second victory in a row (and third in
four races) in Sunday's Save Mart-Kragen 350 at Sears Point Raceway
in Sonoma, Calif. Labonte trails Dale Jarrett by 89 points in the
Winston Cup standings and will need another strong performance from
his No. 18 Interstate Batteries Pontiac to continue his hot streak,
this time on the winding road course at Sears Point, one of two
venues on the Winston Cup schedule where drivers are required to
execute left- and right-hand turns. ``We've been creeping up on
this thing over the past couple years, finishing seventh in points,
sixth in points, just getting closer and closer,'' Labonte said.
``It just seems like things are clicking a little bit better right
now. It's team chemistry and teamwork.'' . . . To prepare for the
challenges of road racing, Winston Cup rookie Tony Stewart took a
few crash courses at the Bob Bondurant School in Phoenix prior to
the Winston Cup event at Talladega, Ala., then took another
intensive one-day Skip Barber road racing course at Sonoma before
the California 500 at Fontana and returned for two more days of
study following the race. ``My first road course race is going to
be an interesting experience,'' said Stewart, who crammed his road
course work in the month before he pulled double duty by running
both the Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 in Charlotte on the
same day, May 30. ``There's definitely an art to driving these big
cars on a road course,'' Stewart said. ``The last time I raced on a
course like this was in a go-kart, which doesn't have much in
common with my Home Depot Pontiac.'' . . . With 5 points separating
Juan Pablo Montoya from Dario Franchitti (90-85) in the CART FedEx
Championship Series points race, watch out for some wild action in
Sunday's Medic Drug Grand Prix of Cleveland on the wide-open runway
and tarmac of Burke Lakefront Airport, which should provide ample
room for three- and four-wide racing. ``There are a lot of
opportunities to pass on this circuit,'' said Franchitti. ``There's
so much room in Turn 1 that you can have four or five cars
side-by-side when the green flag drops.''

COYOTES, HLINKA TALK ABOUT JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Coyotes General Manager  &UR; Bobby Smith confirmed Saturday
that the team has heavy interest in famed Czech Republic Coach
 &UR; Ivan
 &UR; Hlinka joining the club as an assistant on new Coach  &UR; Bobby
Francis' staff.
</P>
<P>
   Hlinka, who has guided the Czechs to three world championships
and the Olympic gold medal last year in Nagano, Japan, met with
Smith and Francis last week in New York.
</P>
<P>
   He could be hired as early as Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a guy I approached, and he's shown some willingness to
come over here,'' Smith said. ``It's very interesting to talk
hockey with him for quite a few hours. Like I said, he's willing to
come (to the NHL), and I think he's looking for a new challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes also have interviewed former Boston Bruins and New
York Islanders Coach  &UR; Rick Bowness for an assistant's role. After
being replaced in New York early last season, Bowness has worked
for the Nashville Predators as a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have talked with Rick,'' Smith said. ``He's a veteran coach
who's been around. Obviously, with a rookie NHL coach, you'd like
to add some experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Many believe Hlinka will become the first European to become a
head coach in the NHL. Smith doesn't discount that theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to happen at some point, I think,'' he said. ``I
don't know when and I don't know who, but it's going to happen, and
he's certainly a likely candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the possible hiring of Hlinka shouldn't be construed
as a way to help the Coyotes re-sign Czech center  &UR; Robert
 &UR; Reichel, who has had a standing offer from Hlinka to become a
full-time player/coach for the national team. Reichel, who becomes
a Group II restricted free agent on July 1, may not return to the
NHL unless he is offered a contract worth more than $3 million a
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at the issues separately,'' Smith said. ``We're
not going to get a guy who's not going to add value to our coaching
staff to appease Robert Reichel. And we're not going to leave a guy
(Hlinka) back if (Reichel isn't re-signed). We could get Reichel
and not get Hlinka.'' &QL; 
Remembering Oleg &QL; 
When  &UR; Oleg Tverdovsky discovers he has been traded back to the
Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, he might gets the shakes. Ever since the
Russian defenseman made some flippant remarks about his former team
before a playoff series three seasons ago, he has been booed
unmercifully in Anaheim every time he touches the puck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be interesting,'' said Washington Capitals Coach
 &UR; Ron Wilson, the former Ducks coach. ``He's a pretty sensitive kid.
I haven't talked to him in two or three years and I don't know if
he's matured as an individual. Oleg's got a big heart and
everything, but he made some comments that you could classify as
immature, and it's haunted him.
</P>
<P>
   ``But fans are pretty forgiving. If he goes in there and
performs, he'll be fine. He's going to play with some great players
and he needs to take advantage of that. It's a fresh start for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Tverdovsky was vacationing in Russia when the Coyotes dealt him
Saturday in exchange for center  &UR; Travis Green and a first-round
pick, which Phoenix used to select Seattle Thunderbirds center
 &UR; Scott
 &UR; Kelman. It is believed he has no knowledge of the trade. &QL; 
Deal off, for now &QL; 
The Coyotes apparently thought they had a deal reached with the
Atlanta Thrashers late Friday night to acquire defenseman
 &UR; Jamie &UR; Pushor, obtained earlier in the day from Anaheim in the
expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   Originally a second-round pick by Detroit in 1991, the 6-foot-3
Pushor didn't know how to react when reporters told him it looked
as though he was about to change teams again.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, though, fell through after Atlanta apparently wanted
the offer to be sweetened. The Coyotes are believed to have offered
a second- or third-round pick in next year's draft for the
fourth-year pro.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some negotiations,'' Thrashers General Manager  &UR; Don
 &UR; Waddell said. ``But right now, we're happy to have Jamie Pushor.'' &QL;

COYOTES STICK TO PLAN IN DRAFT  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Coyotes addressed their primary needs in Saturday's
NHL entry draft, scouring the 1999 class for quality forwards.
</P>
<P>
   They got one of the highest-rated ones they wanted, too, by
making a trade with Anaheim to grab the 15th overall choice and
selecting 18-year-old center Scott Kelman of the Western Hockey
League's Seattle Thunderbirds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I rated out in that area and I was kind of hoping
that's where I'd go,'' said Kelman, a Winnipeg native who scored 63
goals and 168 points the past three seasons for his junior team.
``They gave up a pretty good player (Oleg Tverdovsky) to get me, so
it's nice to come to an organization that really wants you. I'm
going to try and prove to them that they made the right decision
and go out and do my best.''
</P>
<P>
   He underwent minor shoulder surgery last month, but it isn't
expected to slow him down. He also plays baseball, where he is a
pitcher and first baseman for an All-Star team from Winnipeg that
will play in an international tournament next month in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the shoulder, I've been playing mostly first
base,'' said Kelman, whose fastball has been clocked at nearly 90
mph. ``But I'm getting ready to throw the ball sometime next week
and we'll see how it goes. . . . I've definitely picked hockey as
my Number 1 sport, though.''
</P>
<P>
   A handful of major league clubs, including the Los Angeles
Dodgers and Atlanta Braves, have scouted him.
</P>
<P>
   Kelman, who scored 19 goals and 73 points last season, was the
first of five forwards picked by Phoenix with the club's six draft
choices through the first four rounds. Four of them were centers.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes used their other first-rounder on Russian defenseman
Kiril Safronov, who like Kelman, was rated near the top of the pack
at his position. Safronov, 18, is a solid, responsible blueliner
who most scouts agree could be ready to crack a top-four role in
the NHL within a year or two.
</P>
<P>
   Safronov, who speaks excellent English _ he was tutored by his
grandmother, a St. Petersburg schoolteacher _ likens his style of
play to that of Buffalo's Alexei Szhitnik and Dallas' Sergei Zubov.
</P>
<P>
   Although modest, it's apparent Safronov doesn't lack
self-confidence. Asked whether he agrees with most scouts'
appraisal that he might be the best defensemen in this year' draft,
he replied: ``Yes. I think I probably am the best.''
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't shown much offensively, scoring only one goal and
adding one assist for St. Petersburg. But he made a huge jump while
playing for Team Russia in the World Junior Championships in
Winnipeg, further impressing scouts and raising his stock for
Saturday's showcase at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that tournament helped me a lot,'' he said. ``It opened
some eyes. It was very important that I played well there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes selected Brad Ralph, a quality scoring left wing
from the Oshawa Generals, with their second-round pick, the 53rd
choice overall. He netted 31 goals and 75 points last season and
was the Ontario Hockey League's Rookie of the Year the previous
season, when he scored 20 goals and 37 points.
</P>
<P>
   With the third-round pick they swapped with the New York
Islanders as part of the Robert Reichel-Brad Isbister trade, the
Coyotes took Jason Jaspers, a 5-foot-11{, 185-pound center from OHL
Sudbury who scored 28 goals and 61 points for the Wolves. They then
grabbed two more centers with two picks in the fourth round, Ryan
Lauzon, who scored 21 goals and 47 points for the Hull Olympiques
of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, and Preston Mizzi, who
scored 29 goals and 58 points for Peterborogh of the OHL.

TIME TO DEMOTE JIMENEZ? AN EMPHATIC NO-NO 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was not a night for modest pronouncements.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal,'' Cardinals pitcher Jose Jimenez said after throwing
the first no-hitter of the season Friday night, ``is to be a
superstar.''
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old righthander took a giant step in that direction
with his no-no, which came in a 1-0 win over the Arizona
Diamondbacks and ace Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez, a Dominican who comes from Sammy Sosa's neighborhood in
San Pedro de Macoris, was an unlikely candidate to author a
no-hitter, despite his status as one of the team's best pitching
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez threw a no-hitter for Double A Arkansas last season, and
led the Southern League in wins (15) and earned run average (3.11).
Called up in September by the Cardinals, he won all three of his
starts, then won his first two this season.
</P>
<P>
   The game, he said, was coming too easily.
</P>
<P>
   That changed in a hurry, however, as Jimenez lost seven
decisions in a row and gave up 55 earned runs in 57 1/3 innings.
Despite an outstanding sinker and an improving changeup and slider,
Jimenez was another start or two away from being demoted to the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Until Friday night, that is, when he was bigger than the Big
Unit, although aided by two sliding catches by outfielder Eric
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   One of those catches came with one out in the ninth, when Davis
grabbed a liner by pinch hitter David Dellucci off his shoetops
with a tumbling catch. Davis came up with the ball in his glove,
then dropped it as he waved his arm, signalling a catch. Umpires
Jeff Nelson at first and Mark Wegner at second both ruled that
Davis had caught the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez's no-hitter was the Cardinals' first since Bob Forsch's
on Sept. 26, 1983. He became the second Cardinal rookie to throw a
no-hitter; Paul Dean, Dizzy's brother, threw one in 1934. And he
also joined Juan Marichal and Ramon Martinez as Dominican pitchers
who have thrown no-hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to lose too much sleep,'' said losing pitcher
Johnson, beaten by a run in the ninth. ``I pitched a pretty good
ballgame, and we got no-hit.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Padres, after winning their seventh straight Friday night,
including three against Los Angeles, were just a half-game behind
the fourth-place Dodgers, and are doing their best to make a
prophet of GM Kevin Towers, who heard Dodgers GM Kevin Malone
predict a World Series and countered by saying the La-La's would
finish no higher than third.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made their bed, and they have to sleep in it,'' Towers
said. ``We still have to chase them. We'll take a lot more delight
as a group, not just me, in catching and passing them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers third baseman Todd Zeile, who realized his dream of
playing for his hometown Dodgers in 1997 only to be traded a year
later, said he's as mystified as anyone as to why the team is
falling short of expectations. ``The Dodgers had that solid
foundation with the O'Malley family,'' Zeile said last week. ``They
understood baseball and understood there's more to it than putting
good names on paper. There has to be cohesiveness, and I don't see
that there yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the old question of which comes first, winning or
chemistry?''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago last Monday, the Fox Group fired Dodgers GM Fred
Claire and manager Bill Russell. Three days later, coaches Reggie
Smith, Mark Cresse, and Glenn Gregson also were dismissed. Claire
is now teaching a sports business and media course at Southern Cal,
though he's also looking for work as a baseball consultant. Russell
is managing Orlando, the Double A affiliate of the Tampa Bay Devil
Rays. Gregson is the Phillies' pitching coach at Triple A Scranton,
while Smith and Cresse are running baseball camps near their homes
in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, meanwhile, are hardly better off than they were a
year ago, when they also were hovering a couple of games under
.500.
</P>
<P>
   One Dodger told Chris Jenkins of the San Diego Union-Tribune:
``I've never been in a clubhouse where so many guys show up late to
the park and leave right after the game. And I've never seen so
many cell phones in one place before.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The reported $400 million price Cablevision would pay for the
Mets is the highest ever for a baseball team, eclipsing the $311
million Fox mogul Rupert Murdoch paid for the Dodgers. Cablevision,
the sixth-largest cable company in the country, already owns a
majority stake in Madison Square Garden, the Knicks, and the
Rangers, and has shown interest in buying the Jets. The Mets, flush
with Cablevision cash, presumably would be better positioned to
pursue building a new ballpark in Queens. How did the Mets' players
react to the impending sale of the club? ``I was going to make a
bid,'' Mike Piazza said. ``See if some of the other guys would chip
in their meal money.'' . . . Sometimes, Mohammed goes to the
mountain: Texas manager Johnny Oates took the unusual step of
kneeling alongside slumping slugger Juan Gonzalez for a 15-minute
chat at the player's locker, rather than calling him into his
office. Gonzalez, frustrated by his recent lack of production,
caused some eyes to roll when he flung his helmet in disgust after
doubling off the left-center-field wall at the Ballpark in
Arlington. Gonzalez, who has said he thinks the power alleys are
too deep there, apparently was upset that the drive fell short of
being a home run . . . The Reds weren't amused by the politicking
the Mets did on behalf of shortstop Rey Ordonez, who trailed
Cincinnati mainstay Barry Larkin, a nine-time All-Star, by fewer
than 8,000 votes with a week of balloting left. Sniffed Reds GM Jim
Bowden, ``We don't have to encourage people to vote for Barry. They
know that Barry's the best all-around shortstop in the league.
Ordonez may be one of the best defensive shortstops, but Barry's
the complete package.'' Meanwhile, the close race between
shortstops Nomar Garciaparra and Derek Jeter in the American League
is reminiscent of the razor-edge margin by which another Sox
shortstop, Rick Burleson, edged his Yankee counterpart, Bucky Dent,
for the starting spot in 1977. Dent more than made up for that, of
course, a year later . . . Holyoke's Mark Wohlers, who had been
making encouraging progress in his comeback, ran into a bit of a
setback Thursday night while pitching for the Reds' Single A team
in Chattanooga. In a steady rain, Wohlers gave up three runs on a
hit, two walks, and three wild pitches. Only 13 of his 29 pitches
went for strikes . . . With their biggest crowd of the season,
40,553, showing up Friday for the opener of a series with the
Phillies, the Cubs went over the 1 million mark in attendance on
just their 29th home date, and they are a quarter of a million
ahead of last season's pace . . . The Mariners face the Rangers six
times in the next 10 days in a belated attempt to rejoin the race
in the AL West. Biggest difference between the clubs? The Rangers'
bullpen began this weekend's series with a 17-2 record, 28 saves in
34 chances, and an AL-low ERA of 3.46. The Mariners' pen,
meanwhile, was 9-15 with 17 saves in 28 chances and an AL-worst ERA
of 6.48 . . . Five weeks after undergoing surgery to repair a
partial tear in his rotator cuff, Arizona pitcher Todd Stottlemyre
was playing catch, which places him far ahead of projections. He
was scheduled to be reevaluated at the start of this week . . . The
D-Backs, who need a closer in the wake of the Gregg Olson meltdown,
have shown some interest in Montreal's Ugueth Urbina. The Expos
reportedly were asking for one of Arizona's three top starters at
Double A El Paso: Nick Bierbrodt, Brad Penny, or John Patterson.
The D-Backs also inquired about Reds reliever Danny Graves.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>

   The Rockies have scored 10 or more runs 16 times this season.
Six times they've scored 12 or more _ and have a 3-3 record to show
for those games. They blew a 9-1 lead in a loss to the Cubs last
week. ``I think,'' Larry Walker said, ``you'll find most of the
time it has happened at home. In this ballpark you know there are
going to be those nights where you get hammered. You can't hang
your head. You can't give up. You just come back the next game
knowing that you could do the hammering, and go about your job.'' .
. . The King, Jim Leyritz, went on the disabled list for the first
time in his career after his left hand was fractured by a pitch
from Chan Ho Park of the Dodgers. Leyritz probably will come off
the DL just in time to be traded from San Diego to a contender.
Wherever he goes, he won't be coveted for his ability to throw out
base-stealers. He caught just 3 of 29 runners for the Padres this
season . . . Promoted to take Leyritz's place on the Padres roster
is Ben Davis, their much-heralded catcher of the future. Davis, who
was the second pick in the 1995 draft, has unlimited potential. ``I
would like to have his future,'' said Don Logan, the general
manager of the Triple A Las Vegas Stars. ``He's got it going on.
He's solid, man. Church every Sunday, too.'' . . . The Philadelphia
police department reportedly is continuing an investigation of the
June 11 hotel bar scuffle in which Blue Jays manager Jim Fregosi
was struck in the left eye and pitching coach Mel Queen was hit in
the side of the head with a beer bottle . . . Twelve of the 25
players on Tampa Bay's Opening Day roster have been on the disabled
list. Four of the original five starters in the rotation have been
on the DL. Where does it hurt? Everywhere. Lefthanded pitcher Tony
Saunders fractured his arm and went on the DL. Dave Eiland was
called up from Triple A to replace him and had to come out of his
second start with back spasms. He went on the DL. Mickey Callaway
was called up from Triple A to replace him and in his second start
pulled a hamstring and went on the DL. Callaway threw just 10
pitches before he had to come out. Pitcher Rick White was in the
clubhouse when a batboy ran back to tell him he was going into the
game. White thought it was a prank and ignored the kid. Only after
he saw on TV that Callaway was walking off the mound did he sprint
out of the clubhouse. ``I get there and (umpire) Rocky (Roe) says,
`By the way, there are two men on and a 3-0 count on the hitter,'
'' White said. ``I'm thinking, `That's nice.' ''

   Detroit's Bill Haselman, who shared Sox catching duties two
years ago with Scott Hatteberg, has asked to be traded. Haselman
signed as a free agent and thought he'd be playing regularly, but
the Tigers traded a month later for Brad Ausmus . . . The Tigers
are very protective of pitching prodigy Jeff Weaver. They won't
allow him to throw more than 110 pitches in a start. ``You can't
sacrifice the future for right now,'' manager Larry Parrish said,
citing broken-down Cubs star Kerry Wood as a case in point. Wood
exceeded 110 pitches 13 times as a rookie last season, including a
span in which he threw at least 121 pitches four times in five
starts, and another span in which he threw at least 119 in four
straight starts. Wood is missing all of this season because of
elbow surgery. ``Some people are thinking I don't want to win,''
Parrish said of his pitch-count removals of Weaver. ``I feel like I
want to win more than anybody. I'm the guy that it affects the
most.'' . . . Overlooked on the Indians' All-Star-laden roster is
reliever Steve Karsay, who came into the season with seven wins, a
total he's already matched. In 32 appearances, Karsay is 7-1 with a
2.20 ERA. Batters are hitting .224 against him. The Indians' record
for most wins by a reliever is 12, by Sid Monge in 1979 and Dan
Spillner in 1982 . . . Joe Torre's lineup reshuffling, putting
Bernie Williams in the second spot ahead of Derek Jeter, has had
dramatic results. They reached base in the same inning seven times
in the first five games since the switch. ``A lot of guys are
seeing the ball well, and it's great to see them get their
confidence going,'' said Roger Clemens. ``We've got a lot of guys
who are tough on themselves.''

OFFICIAL CONFIRMS WOLF ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The inevitable happened.
</P>
<P>
   A pack of Mexican gray wolves, an endangered species
reintroduced into Arizona, attacked a domestic cattle calf on a
ranch north of Clifton.
</P>
<P>
   An interagency team of biologists now is monitoring the Pipestem
Pack's movements in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest on a
24-hour basis.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, the injured calf was discovered on the T-Link
Ranch by the ranch manager.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Alan Armistead, a biologist for the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's Wildlife Services and the wolf team's depredation
specialist, concluded after examining the calf that its wounds
include bites and scrapes that were consistent with a wolf attack.
</P>
<P>
   The calf is expected to recover from the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The attack occurred in the same area, where in the middle of
June, biologists discovered the mostly consumed remains of two
calves and a partially consumed adult cow. The cow died after its
hind leg became tangled in the strands of a barbed-wire fence.
</P>
<P>
   The livestock manager was contacted after the find and
participated in investigating it.
</P>
<P>
   Cause of the three animals' death couldn't be determined. Both
coyotes and wolves were found in the area, and one or both had fed
on the carcasses. The wolf pack was in the area at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Another calf was found dead last Thursday in the Pipestem Pack's
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Monitoring of that pack has been intensified through radio
collars. The wolves' location will be determined every four hours,
day and night. If the wolves move to the location of livestock,
they will be run off. Supplemental food is being provided near the
pack's den site.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists determined the pups were born to the Pipestem Pack
this spring. The number hasn't been determined. This is the second
litter produced by the pack.
</P>
<P>
   The only surviving pup for a year ago disappeared after its
mother was illegally shot last August.
</P>
<P>
   The ranch's livestock manager plans to move the cows and calves
to another place, far away from the wolf activity.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists expressed their appreciation for the cooperation of
the livestock manager. This is an attempt to discourage the wolves
from preying on livestock.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of Wildlife, a non-profit conservation organization,
will offer compensation to the livestock owner, as is its policy
when the loss or injury of domestic livestock occurs and is caused
by wolves.
</P>
<P>
   More than 24 wolves now range the Apache-Sitgreaves. That's
nearly triple the number of last year at this time.
</P>
<P>
   The first confirmed attack on domestic animals occurred in May
of 1998. A member of the Campbell Blue pack attacked a miniature
horse colt. The owner was compensated by Defenders of Wildlife for
the veterinarian expenses, and the colt survived.
</P>
<P>
   The organization also compensated owners in the wolf-recovery
unit for the death of a ranch dog and injury of another dog,
following a fight with a wolf. &QL; 
Fire restrictions &QL; 
Last Wednesday, fire restrictions were changed on Bureau of Land
Management lands.
</P>
<P>
   Fire restrictions were placed on the Hualapai and Cerbat
mountains in northwestern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Open campfires are allowed only in developed campgrounds or
where specifically posted. Propane gas stoves, lanterns and heaters
are allowed in all areas. Smoking is allowed only in developed
campgrounds and recreation sites, including buildings or vehicles
or in an area that has been cleared of flammable material.
</P>
<P>
   The Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest has lifted fire
restrictions on the Apache part of the forest. That includes the
Clifton, Alpine and Springerville ranger districts.
</P>
<P>
   The area has received enough moisture to allow campfires in
dispersed areas. &QL; 
Mammal tracking &QL; 
Glendale Community College will offer a class on tracking mammals
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The class is designed for hunters, naturalists, photographers,
scouts and others who wish to follows the tracks and signs of wild
animals.
</P>
<P>
   The class will include distinguishing common tracks, reading
subtle signs such as gnawing, droppings and claw marks plus other
information.
</P>
<P>
   Course registration is $14 plus $10 for the instructor. For more
information, call (623) 845-3333. &QL;

COLLINS IN CHARGE  
 NEW CONTRACT EMPOWERS ANGELS MANAGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Major league kudos go out to Anaheim General Manager  &UR; Bill
Bavasi, who did not cave in to the wishes of 10 of his players who
had voiced displeasure with Manager  &UR; Terry Collins' game management
and sometimes abrasive manner.
</P>
<P>
   When asked on a conference call with reporters if he had
concerns over how the extension might be received within the
clubhouse, Bavasi, who grew up in a baseball family, answered
directly and bluntly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who cares?'' said Bavasi, the son of longtime Dodgers, Angels
and Padres GM  &UR; Buzzie Bavasi. ``As Buzzie always said, we need good
players, not happy ones. I'm more concerned with how our on-field
performance is going over in the clubhouse. I know it's not going
over too well in the offices of the general manager and the field
manager.''
</P>
<P>
   So now what? For one, Collins, whose five big-league clubs
(three in Houston and two in Anaheim) have all finished in second
place, is free to do as he pleases with these Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any way Terry handles players is up to him,'' Bavasi said.
``I'm not looking for him to change. . . . It's the players'
responsibility to react to what he wants done, not his
responsibility to react to what they want done.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins, who received a two-year extension that includes a club
option for 2002, can't be blamed for the injuries that have ravaged
the Angels this season. It started in spring training when
shortstop
 &UR; Gary DiSarcina, the heart and soul of this club, was sidelined
until last week after he suffered a broken bone in his arm.
</P>
<P>
   It continued when center fielder  &UR; Jim Edmonds was lost for at
least four months after surgery and right fielder  &UR; Tim Salmon went
down also. That's a lot of sock the offense has been missing.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the players seemed indifferent to Collins
extension. One veteran who remains one of the best baseball players
in the game and probably was not part of the veteran revolt, is &UR; 
 &UR; DiSarcina, who, as usual, summed up what needs to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to do a better job of focusing on the game,'' he said.
``It's been a blurred vision around here. Maybe this is a signal.
This is the way it's going to be. Terry's here to stay. Deal with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi's signal can only be viewed as a boon for major league
managers everywhere. &QL; 
Trivial question &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Toronto's  &UR; Tony Fernandez, who is flirting with a .400 average,
is attempting to become the oldest player in major league history
to win a batting crown for the first time in his career. Fernandez
will turn 37 on Wednesday. Who is the oldest player to win a
batting championship without ever winning one before and how old
was he? &QL; 
Tinkering in the Bronx &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yankees Manager  &UR; Joe Torre did a bit of lineup juggling last
week and the results have been impressive, even if a three-game
sweep over the lowly Tampa Bay Devil Rays is thrown into the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Torre, who has never been a great fan of batting  &UR; Bernie
Williams in the cleanup spot, shifted the center fielder into the
second spot. Williams entered the weekend series batting .556 (15
for 27) since the move. In turn, the Yankees have been helped. They
rose to 14 games over .500 Thursday, their best mark of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The other shuffling included moving  &UR; Derek Jeter from second to
third,  &UR; Paul O'Neill from third to fifth and  &UR; Tino Martinez from
fifth to fourth. Moving Williams, who is now followed by Jeter,
Martinez and O'Neill, basically forces opposing pitchers to throw
better pitches to Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take the credit, sure,'' Torre joked. ``But I don't think
changing spots means a whole lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kile pile &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The biggest name free-agent pitcher after the 1997 season has
not done so well since signing a three-year $24 million contract.
But  &UR; Darryl Kile, who spurned the Diamondbacks' equal offer to take
Colorado's that winter, insists he has no regrets with his
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not one bit,'' said Kile, who watched a 9-1 lead evaporate at
Coors Field Tuesday in what turned out to be a 12-11 loss to
Chicago. ``I came here to do a job, and I am going to try to do the
best I can. The only thing I try to do is go out and pitch when
they tell me to pitch and help this team win.''
</P>
<P>
   There is growing concern within the Rockies organization that
Kile's game is simply not suited for the high altitude at Coors
Field, that his curveball, considered the best in the game two
years ago, has no chance of snapping the same way in the high and
dry air in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers back up that claim. Since he signed with the
Rockies, Kile is 6-10 with a 6.64 ERA at Coors Field. On the road
he is 11-11 with a 4.19 ERA. The year before he came to Colorado,
when he finished fifth in the Cy Young Award voting, he posted a
19-7 record with a 2.57 ERA for Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Kile was 10-3 with a 2.59 ERA when pitching at the Astrodome
that season and 9-4 with a 2.55 ERA on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation is now running around that Colorado may have no
choice but to trade Kile, who is trying to discourage such talk but
probably realizes there may be some truth to the notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a commitment to come here and do the best I can for as
long as I am here, whether it's longer (than three years), shorter
or a full (three-year) term,'' said Kile, who is scheduled to start
today in San Diego. ``I do the best I can every time I pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   You still have to wonder how many free agent pitchers will even
consider going to Colorado. After all, if Kile couldn't handle it,
who could?
</P>
<P>
   ``They couldn't pay me enough money to play here,'' said Chicago
Cubs pitcher  &UR; Steve Trachsel, who will be a free agent after this
season. ``It ruins the back of your baseball card.'' &QL; 
Could he have helped? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota reliever  &UR; Hector Carrasco, released by the
Diamondbacks during spring training last year, is back with the
Twins after coming very close to dying earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   Carrasco, who was diagnosed with blood clots in his pitching
shoulder and eventually needed surgery to repair a damaged artery,
was activated by the Twins this weekend. During Carrasco's final
tuneups he pitched 1 scoreless innings Tuesday and followed it up
with another scoreless inning Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The former Cincinnati set-up pitcher, had a lively fastball and
is actually throwing his change-up with confidence, something the
Diamondbacks tried in vain to instill in the right-hander last
spring. &QL; 
Trivial answer &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Montreal's  &UR; Al Oliver led the National League with a
.331 average. At age 35, Oliver became the oldest player ever to
win a batting title without ever having done so before. Four other
players accomplished the feat at age 34 _  &UR; Billy Williams of the
Cubs in 1972, Brooklyn's  &UR; Dixie Walker in 1944, Detroit's  &UR; Charlie
Gehringer in 1937 and Cincinnati's  &UR; Bubbles Hargrave in 1926. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE HIT LIST &QL; 
 &UR; They always said this guy could drive in runs in his sleep:
 &UR; Hack Wilson, the single-season record holder for RBI with 190, had
that total increased to 191 after extensive research proved he was
short-changed during a doubleheader in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Say Bud, can we still change our mind?: The one-year
anniversary of the Dodgers' sale from the  &UR; O'Malley Family to the
Fox Corporation passed last Tuesday. As they close in on their
first 162 games as owners, the Dodgers were 79-79 entering the
weekend series at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback: Dave Cash.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; An indication that MLB is making the right decisions
 &UR; or just dumb luck?: It's looking like a done deal that the Dodgers
will be the first opponent at San Francisco's new Pac Bell Park
next spring. Dodgers-Giants, now that's the way it ought to be.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; It's your feet we need, not your arm: Detroit Manager  &UR; Larry
Parrish summoned  &UR; Gregg Jefferies to pinch-run last weekend.
Jefferies had spent some time in the trainer's room for his tender
elbow and probably didn't expect to play. At least we hope so since
he ran in tennis shoes. &QL; 
EXTRA BASES &QL; 
The June 19 game between Florida and Colorado marked the first time
in 345 major league games played in Denver that neither club issued
a walk. That includes the two years the Rockies played at Mile High
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Having watched  &UR; Kent Bottenfield and  &UR; Dustin
 &UR; Hermanson's careers take off after moving from the bullpen to the
rotation, San Diego is primed to see if it will see similar results
from  &UR; Brian Boehringer, who was placed into the rotation Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland's  &UR; Ben Grieve, who grew up a few miles from the Ballpark
at Arlington, is now batting .348 in 66 career at-bats at Texas'
home ballpark. He has five home runs at Arlington, including a pair
of multi-homer games.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers entered their weekend series in San Francisco with
an unsightly 4.40 team ERA. The worst mark since the club moved
from Brooklyn occurred in 1958 when Dodger pitchers accrued a 4.47
ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs fans can stop fantasizing about pitcher  &UR; Jeremi
 &UR; Gonzalez returning for the stretch run this season. Gonzalez, who
has not pitched since last July because of elbow problems, is due
to undergo `` &UR; Tommy John'' surgery in the coming weeks. He is not
expected to return before 2001.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ben McDonald, the No. 1 overall pick in the 1989 draft, will
not be able to pitch this season. Now with Tampa Bay, McDonald will
have arthroscopic surgery on his shoulder, the same one that had
full-blown rotator cuff surgery last year, soon. If the shoulder
does not respond, McDonald expects his career to be over. &QL; 
THE RUMOR MILL &QL; 
One outfielder who is definitely on the market these days is
Detroit's  &UR; Bobby Higginson, whom the Diamondbacks tried to pry away
from the Tigers during the winter before winding up with
 &UR; Luis &UR; Gonzalez. The Yankees, in need of a left-fielder, may be
interested.
</P>
<P>
   Freaked out reliever  &UR; Mark Wohlers has apparently done a
180-degree turn in Cincinnati's system. Wohlers had a 1-2-3 inning
at Triple A in which nine of his 14 pitches were strikes last week.
It's at the point where Wohlers could be called up to the Reds
later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher  &UR; Chuck Finley, the all-time leader in service time with
the Angels, is contemplating the idea of requesting a trade away
from the only organization he has known. Finley is in the final
year of a contract. Cleveland and the Yankees might be interested
and, who knows, Finley might just wind up right back with the
Angels as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Count Cleveland out of the market if Toronto decides to trade
starter  &UR; David Wells. ``For me, he's out of the picture,'' Indians
GM  &UR; John Hart said. The Blue Jays, however, will continue to listen
to offers for Wells, who may be more attractive to other clubs now
that he is signed through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh left-hander  &UR; Pete Schourek, who has pitched 7 innings
since being removed from the rotation on May 27, has asked Pirates
GM  &UR; Cam Bonifay to trade him. Schourek is guaranteed $2 million
next season. Philadelphia and the Yankees showed some interest but
have since changed their minds. &QL; 
nTHE RANKINGS &QL; 
 &UR; TOP OF THE ORDER &QL; 
 &QL; 
1. ClevelandJust started a 13-game stretch against Kansas City and
Minnesota.  &QL; 
2. NY YankeesThe high-octane machine is revving up in the south
Bronx.  &QL; 
3. AtlantaTeam average ranks 14th in the NL, making their record
more incredible.  &QL; 
4. Houston &UR; Larry Dierker was itching to get back into his Hawaiian

7. CincinnatiThey may not be pretty, but they play the game right.
 &QL; 
8. ArizonaTo quote former Manager  &UR; Kevin Kennedy: ``No bullpen, no

 &QL; 
30. FloridaJust slightly ahead of last year's 108-loss pace.  &QL; 
29. MinnesotaIn an unusual turn, Twins management splurges with
drafted players.  &QL; 
28. Tampa Bay12 of the 25 players on the opening-day roster have
been on the DL.  &QL; 
27. DetroitHow many different ways can we say, underachieving?  &QL; 
26. MontrealAnother week, another battle over a new stadium.  &QL; 
25. AnaheimGM  &UR; Bill Bavasi shows who's boss, extends Manager &UR; Terry
Collins' contract.  &QL; 
24. Los AngelesAt $80 million, easily the most expensive hunk of
junk in the majors.  &QL; 
23. San DiegoA serious two-team battle with the Dodgers to escape
the NL West cellar  &QL; 
22. MilwaukeeThe Brew Crew is getting blue playing at home, where
they can't win. ON THE RISE &QL; 
 &UR; Toronto Blue Jays: Even with slugging first baseman  &UR; Carlos
 &UR; Delgado struggling (he went through an 0-for-25 slump that ended
Wednesday, the Blue Jays have been making a move in the AL East
standings. They remained eight games behind first-place New York
entering the weekend series, but the progress has been noticeable
on the field. Even pitcher  &UR; Joey Hamilton registered his first
victory of the season. The obvious story in Toronto belongs to
 &UR; Tony Fernandez, who was still hitting over .400 entering the
weekend. But  &UR; Shawn Green appears to have emerged as a star and new
closer  &UR; Billy Koch (eight saves) looks like the real thing. This is
a club with a lot of attractive pieces. &QL; 
GOING SOUTH &QL; 
 &UR; Texas Rangers: Playing in what has to be considered the worst
division in baseball definitely has its upside, just ask the
Rangers. Even though they have been scuffling the last two weeks,
losing eight of 13 games actually translated into gaining one-half
game in the AL West standings. But problems are rising. Two-time
MVP  &UR; Juan Gonzalez entered the weekend series with just eight RBIs
in his previous 18 games, going 1 for 18 with runners in scoring
position during that span. Now there may even be added pressure to
do well this season since the Dallas Stars are coming off the
Stanley Cup championship.
 &UR; Tom Hicks owns both the Stars and Rangers and wants the Rangers to
rise to the same level as his hockey club. &QL; 
OVERHEARD &QL; 
Embattled Kansas City closer  &UR; Jeff Montgomery, who has struggled
mightly this season, on an off-season promise he made to himself
concerning his future in the game after this season: ``I've kind of
made a deal with myself that I would retire when either my wife
told me to or the hitters told me to. Right now, the hitters are
screaming that message, I know.'' &QL; 
OUT OF LEFT FIELD &QL; 
Bank One Ballpark fans were treated to a fabulous three-game series
from Cincinnati second baseman  &UR; Pokey Reese, who appears to be
emerging as a potential star. Statistics aside, Reese showed a
tremendous ability to recognize the game from a team standpoint,
rather than the often selfish position some players tend to take
these days. With a single, double and triple already in the books
for him Tuesday night and Reese up with two outs in the ninth, he
was very aware of what was at stake if he hit a home run. The first
pitch he saw was a chest-high fastball, the kind that could easily
be driven. Instead, Reese passed and let it sail by so the Reds
pitcher, who had just run around the bases, could take a breather.
``What he did, take that fastball to help the pitcher, shows how
unselfish he is, thinking about what's best for the club,'' Reds
Manager  &UR; Jack McKeon said. &QL;

STEFAN GOES NO. 1
</HEADLINE>

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For one day, anyway, a Long Beach Ice Dog made a bigger impact
than the big-league Kings and Mighty Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Czech center Patrik Stefan, who played the last two seasons in
Long Beach, was chosen first in the NHL draft Saturday after a
series of trades left the expansion Atlanta Thrashers with the
opening selection in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings, meanwhile, sat idle until the 43rd selection, when
they chose 17-year-old Russian winger Andrei Shefer. Earlier, the
Ducks had dealt center Travis Green and their first-round
selection, No.15, to Phoenix for offensive defenseman Oleg
Tverdovsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Shefer) is a pretty good all-around player, good skater and
good on the defensive side,'' Kings general manager Dave Taylor
said. ``He has no real weaknesses. We expect he'll play another two
years (in Russia).''
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old Tverdovsky, the Ducks' first selection in 1994,
has been with Phoenix since Feb. 7, 1996, when he was dealt to the
Coyotes in the deal that brought Teemu Selanne to Anaheim. Last
season with Phoenix, Tverdovsky played in all 82 games, collecting
seven goals and 25 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks didn't make a selection until immediately after the
Kings selected Shefer. At No.44, the Ducks chose 18-year-old
University of Minnesota defenseman Jordan Leopold.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings had three selections in the third round and used them
on Swedish defenseman Frantisek Kaberle, Ohio State defenseman
Jason Crain and Canadian junior goalie Cory Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant of the three is the 6-foot-1, 185-pound
Kaberle, who is 25 and was named the most valuable defenseman in
Sweden last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a player who we anticipate can step in and play right
away,'' Taylor said. ``He's a very good skater and moves the puck
very well.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an eventful day in the draft, with a series of trades
announced even before selections began.
</P>
<P>
   Once the trades were completed, Tampa Bay's first pick belonged
to Atlanta, Vancouver had the second and third selections and the
New York Rangers had the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The result of this action was that Stefan, the only player in
this draft expected to make an impact in the NHL next season, ended
up in Atlanta, and Swedish twins Daniel and Henrik Sedin wound up
together with the Canucks.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, youth conscious after the retirement of Wayne
Gretzky and their failure to acquire star forward Ziggy Palffy from
the New York Islanders, chose Czech winger Pavel Brendl, perhaps
the best goal scorer available. The Islanders traded Palffy to the
Kings a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers also had the ninth selection, using it on Canadian
center Jamie Lundmark, and the Islanders had three picks in the top
10, giving the New York metropolitan area half of the first 10
selections. The Islanders used their picks on American defenseman
Tim Connolly at No.5, Canadian winger Taylor Pyatt at No.8 (this
was originally the Kings' selection) and Slovakian defenseman
Branislav Mezei at No.10. The Islanders also had a fourth
first-round selection, the 28th and final pick in the opening
round, and used it on Slovakian defenseman Kristian Kudroc.
</P>
<P>
   Of note for the Kings was that forward Matt Zultek, whom they
drafted in the first round two years ago but never signed, was not
selected until Boston picked him 56th. Two years ago, Zultek was
the 15th player chosen.

DUCKS TRADE FOR TVERDOVSKY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mighty Ducks general manager Pierre Gauthier was waiting
patiently to make the No. 15 pick in the 1999 NHL Entry Draft on
Saturday in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve teams had already made their selections when the phone
rang and Phoenix GM Bobby Smith was on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes Gauthier made Ducks history of sorts. He traded
away Anaheim's first-round pick for the first time in the club's
existence, packaging it with center Travis Green to acquire
former-Duck Oleg Tverdovsky from the Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never say never,'' said Gauthier, who like former GM Jack
Ferreira, had long expressed a reluctance to trade draft picks,
especially first-rounders.
</P>
<P>
   But Gauthier all but admitted Saturday's deal was a no-brainer,
especially for a team that struggled to score in even strength
situations last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We filled our No. 1 need,'' he said. ``There wasn't a fan or
media member that couldn't answer what our No. 1 need was.''
</P>
<P>
   The smooth-skating Tverdovsky, who was the No. 2 overall pick by
the Ducks in the 1994 draft, was a part of the blockbuster trade
that brought Teemu Selanne to Anaheim in 1996. But the Ducks have
since struggled to find a presence on the blue line that could
compliment the skills of Selanne and Paul Kariya.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings a offensive element,'' said Gauthier. ``And I don't
think a team can win (a Stanley Cup) without that type of player.''
</P>
<P>
   Tverdovsky's defense is not considered his strength, but even
defensive-minded Craig Hartsburg is excited about the prospect of
adding a defenseman who can carry the puck out of his own zone and
jump into the play when the opportunity presents itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is a world class player,'' said the Mighty Ducks
coach, who hopes to play Tverdovsky with Kariya and Selanne as much
as possible in 5-on-5 situations. ``He makes us better, faster and
more exciting for our fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get a chance to add a player like that you have to
take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier inquired about Tverdovsky's availability last month,
only to have Smith say it would ``take an unbelievable deal'' to
pry him away from the Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith, who displayed interest in Green over the past month,
finally called Gauthier on Saturday and asked what it would acquire
the center, who had 13 goals and 30 points last season.
</P>
<P>
   When Gauthier said ``Oleg,'' Smith replied ``Oleg Tverdovsky?''
</P>
<P>
   After a pause, Gauthier said Smith said ``it's a deal and he
hung up.''
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier, surprised and delighted, admitted when he went to
finalize the deal with Smith he still thought ``maybe I
misunderstood.''
</P>
<P>
   Tverdovsky was an all-star for the Coyotes in '97 when he scored
10 goals and 55 points. But he had his share of troubles in Phoenix
as well. He was a holdout at the beginning of the '97-98 season and
was involved in a well-publicized fight with Jeremy Roenick. The
low point for Tverdovsky came during the recent playoffs when he
was a healthy scratch in the seventh game of the Coyotes-St. Louis
Blues first-round series.
</P>
<P>
   The defenseman becomes a restricted free agent on July 1, but
Gauthier said he has already talked with Tverdovsky's agent and
does not expect problems signing him to a new deal.
</P>
<P>
   Tverdovsky has been a favorite target of angry Ducks fans since
comments he made about the Anaheim franchise were taken out of
context before the Ducks-Phoenix playoff series in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But the 23-year old should certainly be a favorite of Anaheim
forwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense did what they did best last year and that was
defend,'' said Hartsburg. ``But we felt we had to upgrade our
transition game.''
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier added two more defensemen to the system in the second
and third round when he selected Jordan Leopold with the No. 44
pick and Niklas Havelid with the No. 83.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim hopes those two players will be contributors 2-3 years
down the line, but there's little doubt the Gauthier was thinking
about Tverdovsky's immediate impact when he said ``it's a great day
for the Mighty Ducks.''

AYALA STUNS TAPIA TO WIN WBA BANTAMWEIGHT TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Paulie Ayala believed all along that Johnny Tapia
did not respect his punching power. And ultimately that punching
power cost Tapia his World Boxing Association bantamweight
championship last night.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth's Ayala lured Tapia into the ultimate street fight at
the Mandalay Bay Events Center to register a stunning, unanimous
12-round decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Johnny Tapia. I've said he may have been the best
junior bantamweight in the world,'' Ayala said moments after
handing Tapia his first professional defeat. ``But I'm the best
bantamweight \R118-pounder\S in the world. I knew he has never
faced an opponent like me. I was fighting my fight. I did a little
boxing, a little slugging. I knew they underestimated my punching
power.''
</P>
<P>
   In a fight that featured no knockdowns, Ayala won by scores of
116-113 on the cards of judges Duane Ford of Las Vegas and Fernando
Viso of Valencia, Venezuela. He prevailed on the card of Guy Jutras
of Montreal, 115-114. The ``Star-Telegram'' had it for Ayala,
115-113.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala, a left-hander ranked No. 2 by the WBA, improved to 28-1
with 12 KOs. Tapia dropped to 46-1-2 with 25 knockouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I was stronger than him. I was hurting him a lot,''
said Tapia, of Albuquerque, N.M.. ``Everybody knows what happened.
But I'm not a poor loser. I give all respect to Mr. Ayala, and the
better man won. There are bigger and better things on the table for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The bad blood between the fighters had begun to boil as early as
the introductions, when Tapia marched over to Ayala and thrust his
gloves into Ayala's neck. That drew a stern warning from referee
Joe Cortez, who was working his 116th title fight, to knock off the
nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   Cortez stopped the fight momentarily at the start of the 10th to
have a cut on Tapia's head examined. Tapia answered by pressing the
action and throwing both hands. Ayala held his ground and
retaliated with a series of left uppercuts. Tapia landed a huge
straight right with 18 seconds left, but Ayala weathered that shot.
</P>
<P>
   Tapia got his punches off first in the ninth, and a left caused
Ayala to stumble forward for a second. Tapia came right back and
threw a right and slipped but got up immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Tapia concentrated on staying inside at the outset of the
eighth, throwing more punches. The champion landed a combination to
the head with 1:30 to go, but Ayala landed a left-right just when
it looked he was tiring. Tapia then began to exhort the crowd to
turn it up.
</P>
<P>
   The seventh round was heading into its final minute when Ayala
threw a four-punch flurry to the head that got Tapia on his
bicycle. The challenger closed with another series of shots off the
shoulders and head, and then snapped off a right to the head just
before the bell.
</P>
<P>
   Tapia did throw more rights in the sixth, and briefly switched
to a southpaw stance. The champion closed with a flurry and
straight right that likely stole him the round.
</P>
<P>
   Between rounds, trainer Freddie Roach implored Tapia to throw
the right lead and double left hook.
</P>
<P>
   The slugging got toe-to-toe in the fifth, each fighter landing
body shots off hooks with their respective power hands. In the
final minute, Ayala began loading up shots to the head to finish
strong.
</P>
<P>
   Tapia began using his jab to distance himself from Ayala in the
fourth, but Ayala continued to press forward. Tapia landed a
straight right, a shot that was met by a flurry of body shots from
Ayala. The fighters bumped heads with about 1:30 remaining, but
continued without a stoppage. With the round drawing to a close,
the pair bumped heads again.
</P>
<P>
   An Ayala right to the head spun Tapia early in the third round.
The pair then settled into the middle of the ring, and Tapia lost
his balance and nearly fell down after a right hook to the head.
The right hook continued to drive Tapia back with a minute left.
</P>
<P>
   Tapia came back with a combination to the face, but Ayala's left
hook continued to score up to the bell. Ayala raised his hands as
he headed back to his corner to signify he had won the round.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala pushed Tapia back at the outset of the second round, and
then landed a series of body shots to the body and head. Tapia
stopped one flurry with a hold, and then responded with a pair of
double left hooks. Ayala answered that salvo with a straight left
hook.
</P>
<P>
   In the night's first title fight, Stevie Johnston of Denver
retained his World Boxing Council lightweight (135-pound) title
with a lackluster, but unanimous, 12-round decision against Aldo
Rios of Argentina. In a fight that began drawing boos from the
crowd for lack of action by the sixth round, Johnston (27-1, 14
knockouts) prevailed by totals of 116-112, 117-112 and 118-110.
</P>
<P>
   Rios, the WBC's No. 6-ranked contender, suffered his first
defeat and is 20-1 with 4 KOs.
</P>
<P>
   In the lead-in to the main event, Eric ``Butterbean'' Esch
defended his International Boxing Association super heavyweight
title with a first-round technical knockout against Peter McNeeley.
Esch, the former Toughman Champion, ended the bout with a flurry of
right uppercuts and left hooks to the head that backed McNeeley
into the ropes. Referee Jay Nady stopped it at 2:59 in the round,
one second from the bell.
</P>
<P>
   Esch, the self-proclaimed ``King of the Four-Rounders,'' went
that distance two weeks ago in Fort Worth. Esch decisioned Russell
Chasteen on a Top Rank card at The Speedway Club at Texas Motor
Speedway. Esch now is 45-1-1 with 34 KOs.
</P>
<P>
   McNeeley, who at 212 pounds weighed 99 pounds less than Esch,
was making his first appearance in Las Vegas since suffering an
embarrassing 89-second, first-round disqualification loss against
former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson on Aug. 19, 1995. The fight
was Tyson's first after serving a prison term after being convicted
of rape in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   McNeeley now is 45-5 with 34 KOs.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala earned a career-best $60,000 last night, barely one-fourth
of Tapia's $250,000 payday. But Ayala downplayed the importance of
his purse before the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have fought Johnny Tapia for a trophy. Or the belt,''
Ayala said. ``I'll be more than happy to brag about my purses after
this fight.''
</P>
<P>
   This was Ayala's second world-title fight in 10 months. Ayala
was unbeaten and the WBC's No. 1-ranked contender when he dropped a
sixth-round technical decision against then-champion Joichiro
Tatsuyoshi in Yokohama, Japan, on Aug. 23.

PEREZ EARNS REPRIEVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Carlos Perez, the Dodgers' lone lefty starter,
didn't earn the win against San Francisco on Saturday. He did,
however, earn another start and seemingly a secure slot in the
Dodgers rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Davey Johnson said Perez will start next Friday against
the Giants when the Dodgers return home to begin a three-game
series. Perez pitched 62/3 innings and gave up two runs on seven
hits in the Dodgers' 7-6 win. His last two outings lasted a
combined 52/3 innings in which he allowed 12 runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you know you're going to start in five days, that makes
it easier,'' said Perez, who lowered his ERA from an NL-leading
7.38 to 6.92. ``That's good for me. I pitched well against the
Giants and Atlanta. It makes me feel OK. It's like the Carlos Perez
of last September.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez went 4-1 with a 1.05 ERA in five starts at the end of last
season, but it's been nothing comparable since. His last start was
June 16. He was pulled after 31/3 innings, bashed a water cooler
and spent much of the next 10 days long-tossing in the outfield to
build arm strength and loosen what had become a tight throwing
motion.
</P>
<P>
   Because of an off day, the Dodgers didn't need a fifth starter
until Saturday. That it came against the Giants was perfect. San
Francisco is 7-12 in games started by lefties and 33-23 against
right-handers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted him against this club because you need lefties
against this club,'' Johnson said. ``I was expecting him to have a
good day and he did a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   An unexpected change in the availability of pitchers Ismael
Valdes (shoulder stiffness) and Kevin Brown (twinge in non-throwing
shoulder) could alter Johnson's plan to start Perez against the
Giants at home. Both pitchers are expected to make their next
starts.
</P>
<P>
   No rabbit trick: Giants first baseman J.T. Snow pulled off a
Houdiniesque move on Perez in the fourth inning, getting the
pitcher with the hidden ball trick. Perez bunted for a two-out base
hit, but Snow never threw the ball back to pitcher Chris Brock.
Instead, the two just lifted their gloves toward each other.
</P>
<P>
   Brock stalled for time behind the pitcher's mound, and Perez,
after talking with first-base coach John Shelby, wandered off first
base. Snow tagged him for the third out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know why he touched my leg,'' said Perez, who had
three hits. ``I saw the ball in his glove and said, `Oh, my God.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sayin' hey: A surprise visitor stopped by the Dodgers' clubhouse
before the game to chat for a few minutes. With the death of Joe
DiMaggio in the spring, Willie Mays is widely regarded as the
greatest living ballplayer, a distinction DiMaggio once held.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably Mays, no doubt,'' Johnson agreed. ``(Ted) Williams or
him. Willie was electrifying. Williams was as pure a hitter as you
can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who played against Mays in the early '70s, recalled
Mays' toughness as a ballplayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came into home and put his shoe right up under the neck of
the (catcher), and everyone said, `Great play,''' Johnson said.
``(Mays) almost decapitated him and everyone said, `Wow, what a
great play.'''
</P>
<P>
   F.Y.I.: Johnson said catcher Angel Pena's ailing right
hamstring, which forced him out of Friday's game, was in better
condition Saturday than it was before Friday's game. Hundley batted
second, the fourth Dodger to bat there in four games.... Because of
the extra activity expected in the Bay Area today, the Dodgers had
to change their plans. The bus is leaving the hotel 30 minutes
earlier than usual because traffic is supposed to resemble the
405/101 merge at rush hour. Not only is the Gay and Lesbian Pride
parade slated for today, but the X-Games are in town.... The Giants
activated outfielder Ellis Burks before the game.

Like it or not, Master P and Co. about to get `rowdy, rowdy'
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JEROME SOLOMON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   IS the sports world ready for this?
</P>
<P>
   There is a recurring theme in the music Master P has produced.
With hard, repetitive beats and profanity-laced lyrics, Master P
makes sure his fans know he and his No Limit Soldiers are ``'bout
it, 'bout it.'' And if you don't like it, they get ``rowdy,
rowdy.''
</P>
<P>
   What are they 'bout?
</P>
<P>
   They are 'bout ``makin' it happen,'' or so the songs say.
</P>
<P>
   Percy Miller is a little different. But like his alter ego
Master P, there is no question he is ``'bout it, 'bout it,'' as
well.
</P>
<P>
   What is he 'bout?
</P>
<P>
   He's 'bout, as he says, ``takin' care of bidness.''
</P>
<P>
   While many young black men have made money in rap music in the
last 15 years, few have shown the vision and business acumen of
Miller, a 28-year-old New Orleans native.
</P>
<P>
   No Limit Inc., the company Miller started as a retail record
store with his $10,000 share of an inheritance, is estimated to
have grossed more than $56 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Turning $10,000 into $56 million in six years is impressive in
any industry.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall Forbes magazine listed Miller as the 10th-highest-paid
entertainer in 1998, behind the likes of Jerry Seinfeld, Oprah
Winfrey and the Rolling Stones, but well ahead of notables like the
Spice Girls, Celine Dion and Garth Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Miller is a true American success story.
</P>
<P>
   Forget what the New York Knicks' Latrell Sprewell says in his
controversial television commercial. Many think Master P, not
Sprewell, is an American nightmare. But reality says Percy Miller
is the American Dream.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's business savvy has led to the formation of No Limit
Sports, which could put him in a brighter national spotlight than
any crossover hit ever could for Master P.
</P>
<P>
   With No Limit Sports, Miller dreams of turning the sports world
upside down, and not with spectacular touchdown runs, towering home
runs or highlight-reel slam dunks.
</P>
<P>
   His clients will do that, or so he hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Tevester Scott, No Limit Sports' chief operating officer, has no
trouble defining the company's objective: ``The ultimate goal of No
Limit is to take over the whole entertainment and sports marketing
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   By landing Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams as its first
high-profile client, No Limit Sports showed it was serious about
accomplishing its goals.
</P>
<P>
   If that didn't prove the point, Miller is building a $21 million
training complex in Baton Rouge for his clients.
</P>
<P>
   Few, if any, agents can compete with that.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't matter to No Limit. Like the chorus of Master P's
signature hit, No Limit plans to simply, ``Make 'Em Say Ugh!''
</P>
<P>
   Mission accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Though some agents refuse to even offer an opinion of Miller and
No Limit Sports, there is no shortage of those willing to criticize
anonymously. Some, though, believe the criticism is premature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of people have jumped up and decided they don't
have a place (in the business) before looking at their
performance,'' said Randy Bowman of Strategic Sports Ventures in
Dallas. ``I don't have any negative opinion of those guys because I
think there is room for anybody who can do a good job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the question is going to be whether or not they can do
a good job. So, I think their performance ought to speak to whether
or not they have a place.''
</P>
<P>
   No Limit believes its place in the business soon will be at the
top, and that is why others have been quick to criticize its early
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the agent community is deathly afraid of us,'' Leland
Hardy, the managing director and chief investment officer at No
Limit Sports, said in an interview for an ESPN Outside the Lines
special. ``I think the football community is eager to have us. We
bring new, fresh enthusiasm to the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that finally the agent community at large realizes
that we have arrived. `We' I mean from two perspectives _ `we,' No
Limit the company, but also the larger `we,' being those from the
community of hip hop. I've longed for almost a decade and talked
about what I call 'the messiah factor.' That eventually one from
among us, a messiah of hip hop, someone who could easily galvanize
the attention of all the young audience of prospective professional
basketball players and others, would realize their ability to
harness the power of their celebrity towards attracting prospective
athlete clients.
</P>
<P>
   `` I'm talking about a cultural kinship and a cultural
sensitivity that transcends race.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardy does not hesitate to make such bold statements because he
believes in the coming years the sports world will find that many
athletes will relate better to No Limit Sports because of its
connection to hip hop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every high school kid who we might want _ black, white, Asian,
otherwise _ is listening to No Limit music in their cars on the way
to school,'' he said. ``We don't have to make a sales pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a kinship of sports and entertainment that few agents can
offer. Solely owned by Miller, No Limit Inc. has under its umbrella
the nation's No. 1 independent record label, a movie and television
production company, an educational program and a line of toys.
</P>
<P>
   Miller also has a shoe deal with Converse, and earlier this
month he and a few cronies took to the lucrative world of
professional wrestling with an appearance at a World Championship
Wrestling event.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of hip hop, No Limit Soldiers are making money
everywhere (in one song he calls himself the ghetto Bill Gates);
only recently has the sports world been invaded.
</P>
<P>
   No Limit Sports, which signed its first clients last fall, has
four registered agents on staff, including Hardy. The company
represents a half dozen NBA players, among them Cleveland's Derek
Anderson and Boston's Ron Mercer, another half-dozen NFL draftees
and several WNBA players.
</P>
<P>
   But its biggest coup was reeling in Williams, the former
University of Texas star, who soon will become just the third
athlete in school history to have his jersey number retired.
</P>
<P>
   Having Williams, a first-round pick of the New Orleans Saints
(fifth overall) in the 1999 NFL draft, as a client gives No Limit
Sports instant credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people say a I took a big chance in going with No
Limit, but it was the best decision for me,'' Williams said.
``There is a family atmosphere there that I don't think I would get
anywhere else, and that's what helped sway me in their direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as all the negative talk I've never been concerned too
much with what other people think.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a good thing, especially since Williams' incentive-laden,
eight-year, $16.2 million contract has been widely criticized by
other agents.
</P>
<P>
   The deal includes a hefty $8.84 million signing bonus, but then
calls for Williams to be paid the league minimum salary throughout
the length of the agreement. However, incentives within the deal
could increase its value to more than $68 million.
</P>
<P>
   Also, bucking a now common trend, the contract has no buyout
clause that would allow Williams to renegotiate with the Saints or
become a free agent after a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh Steinberg, who is one of the country's top sports agents,
thought that deal might not be the best one Williams could have
gotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm leery of second-guessing a contract,'' Steinberg said in
an ESPN.com article. ``But the goal with a running back, who had
considerable leverage _ his team had traded their future picks
away; he was their only pick _ is to secure the largest up-front
signing bonus possible and then create a voidable year structure
that allows that player to come back within four years and
negotiate as a veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``To accept a contract with minimum base salaries is extremely
unusual. To sign away seven years plus an option year essentially
commits the entire career of a running back to his rookie contract.
That is not the goal with high-round picks.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams is not concerned about his deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my decision,'' Williams said at a Saints minicamp
earlier this month. ``Whether it's good or bad, I'm the one that
has to deal with it. So it doesn't bother me. If I had held out for
a buyout, I wouldn't be in camp right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said a buyout clause was not necessary because he wants
to be a member of the Saints for his entire career and if he earns
his keep, as he expects, money will not be a concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a respect between us,'' Williams said of his
relationship with Saints management. ``They're not going to (take
advantage of) me. I think they're honorable people. If I rush for
1,500 yards in my first three or four years, they're going to want
to redo the contract. I treated them fairly, and I think they'll
treat me fairly.''
</P>
<P>
   Agents say Hardy, a rookie to deal-making with NFL teams, may
have been taken advantage of in an attempt to sign his client
quickly to let the league's powers-that-be know that No Limit would
be easy to deal with in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``With as much leverage as they had, it is hard to believe he
accepted that deal,'' said an agent who did not want to be
identified. ``The negative press they got when they got into the
business must have played a role in that. That was probably the
worst deal they could have agreed to. I would still be laughing had
the Saints come to me with that one, and I know people are laughing
at No Limit for agreeing to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they will learn that most of the time image is not as
important as doing the best you can for your client, even if it
takes a long, drawn-out negotiating process to get it done. Most of
the time, fast, quick and easy is not good.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowman said the flak No Limit is getting might be much ado about
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's room for more than a little bit of professional envy
when it comes down to those guys,'' he said. ``Who cares what a
bunch of stinking agents think about if No Limit ought to be
around; there a few players who think they ought to be around.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can't do a good job for their players, they will come
into the sports rep industry and they will leave, much like Hammer
did a few years ago. If they can deliver quality and provide a good
service for their clients, and they have expertise, they'll be
around. If they can't I won't have to worry about 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Miller and his agents at No Limit may have hit
the scene thinking they will continue to be ``bout it, bout it.''
But if they can't get the job done they will be out it, out it,
whether the sports world is ready for them or not. &QL;

ANGELS WIN UGLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ You've heard of winning ugly?
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' futuristic jerseys that were part of a ``Turn ahead
the clock night'' promotion Saturday night at Edison Field
certainly won't be featured in fashion magazines any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   And although the jerseys might have strained the eyes of 29,957
in the seats, the Angels felt good inside after beating the Oakland
A's 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   One Angels player said a matching pair of red pants would have
made the uniform a ``perfect pair of pajamas.'' Another said the
pants clashed because ``pinstripes will be out in 2021.''
</P>
<P>
   What looked good to the Angels was Gary DiSarcina's two-out,
two-strike, RBI single to right field in the sixth that tied the
game at 4-4 and capped a rally from a 4-0 deficit. And Darin
Erstad's spectacular diving catch of Miguel Tejada's liner to left
in the top of the seventh with the potential go-ahead run on second
base.
</P>
<P>
   And Garret Anderson's RBI single in the seventh that gave the
Angels a 5-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   There was also the pitching of Mike Magnante (31/3 scoreless
innings) and Shigetoshi Hasegawa in relief of starter Tim Belcher,
who left the game with a sprained finger after four innings.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher tagged out Ryan Christenson in a play at the plate,
ending a rundown to close out the fourth inning. He sprained the
pinky finger on his right hand, not to mention the beating the A's
gave him.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher gave up four runs on five hits in four innings and was
hurt by his own inability to throw strikes. He walked five.
</P>
<P>
   While Belcher was knocked out of the game by injury, it didn't
hurt the Angels' chances Saturday. Signs that Belcher was off his
game were evident early. With two out in the first, Belcher fell
behind in the count to Ben Grieve, then grooved a 3-1 pitch that
Grieve sent into the right field seats.
</P>
<P>
   In the second inning, Belcher walked three batters, but got help
from his defense.
</P>
<P>
   With two on and nobody out, Mike MacFarlane hit one to the
center-field fence. But Anderson made a leaping catch and doubled
up Matt Stairs at first via a relay by second baseman Randy
Velarde. The Angels nearly got a triple play out of it, but the
throw to second to get John Jaha was late.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher didn't escape so easily in the third, yielding a
three-run homer to Jason Giambi for a 4-0 A's lead. Belcher worked
his way out of a fourth-inning jam, but couldn't make it out for
the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels climbed back in on an RBI single by Velarde in the
third inning and a two-run fourth, highlighted by Steve Decker's
RBI double and Orlando Palmeiro's RBI single to cut their deficit
to 4-3.

Despite barriers, blacks making inroads into sports industry
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JEROME SOLOMON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   IT is such a common occurrence that many among them are not even
fazed by it. It comes with the territory.
</P>
<P>
   Black sports agents are no more monolithic than black people in
general are, but they all know that at some point they will share
in a common experience and be rejected by a client not because of
knowledge, expertise or ability, but because of race.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all have, as described by one black agent, a
``But-for-all-that-melanin-I'd-hire-you'' story.
</P>
<P>
   Though surely less damaging than the violence often associated
with overt racism and less meaningful to the world than the subtle
racism African-Americans contend with on a daily basis, what black
agents encounter in their world is a problem.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that black agents are subjected to
discrimination from black athletes as much as from white ones.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago Larry Reynolds represented a talented minor-league
ballplayer at the Class AAA level who told him he needed to change
agents because he felt it would be easier to get to the big leagues
if he had a white agent. That player now makes more than $6 million
a year. That player is black.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how he had been conditioned to think,'' said Reynolds,
who heads Reynolds Sports Management. ``Fortunately for me, a lot
of those issues have subsided.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there are people out there who view my race as a
problem, but I think it was more so a problem 10-15 years ago than
now because I have been in the business quite some time and have
built a solid reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to say `Look at character before color,' and if I can
get somebody to do that, then I'll be fine. And that goes for all
prospective clients, black or white.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds, who counts among his clients Astros outfielder Carl
Everett and shortstop Ricky Gutierrez, is one of an estimated 400
African-Americans who are registered as sports agents with the NFL,
NBA and Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the players unions of those three professional leagues
have registered roughly 1,600 agents.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles-based Black Sports Agents Association says that
though blacks make up 70 percent of NBA players, 67 percent of NFL
players and 17 percent of Major League Baseball players, only 11
percent of black athletes have black agents.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL Players Association, the only players union that would
venture a guess at the racial breakdown of its registered agents,
said roughly 30 percent of its 956 agents are blacks but estimates
that only 10 percent of its 1,600 players are represented by
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball is believed to be slightly behind that figure and
baseball well off that mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really shouldn't matter what race an agent is,'' said
Rockets forward Scottie Pippen, whose agent, Jimmy Sexton, is
black. ``In this day, that should not be a factor. With the kind of
money that is out there, you really need somebody that you can put
your confidence in to get you the best deals and give you the best
service. If you overlook somebody because they are black, you might
miss out on a person that could do the best job for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Francis, the NFLPA director of communication, said the
number of people registering as agents, including blacks, has been
growing rapidly the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know it has changed
dramatically the last five years,'' Francis said. ``I don't know if
it's (the movie) Jerry Maguire or what, but the business has
increased its numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also the money. You have to understand, agents took some
$60 million out of the (NFL) free agency system last year.''
</P>
<P>
   With that kind of money available in an already near-cutthroat
arena, the competition for clients is stiff. When race is a part of
the equation, as it so often is, the battle intensifies.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that regardless of qualifications, black agents point
to having to convince athletes they can get the job done as a
hurdle they must negotiate before they can negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   C. Lamont Smith, president and CEO of All Pro Sports and
Entertainment Inc., is the first African-American to represent two
Heisman Trophy winners (Barry Sanders and Eddie George), and he
lists NFL stars Jerome Bettis (Pittsburgh), Willie Roaf (New
Orleans), Steve Atwater (New York Jets) and Chad Brown (Seattle)
among his clients.
</P>
<P>
   On his website, he cites as his biggest obstacle ``getting over
the mental hurdle with players that, as a black man, I am just as
competent, if not more, than my non-black competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters, and further intensifying the battle for
clients, are white agents who players have said court them by
saying they need a white person on their side at the negotiating
table with white team owners and almost all-white general managers
in professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our business is a lucrative one, and some people _ a lot of
people _ will do whatever it takes to get a client,'' Reynolds
said. ``That shouldn't be an issue with me, because if I continue
to do things decently and in order, and work hard, opportunities
will continue to present themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Bowman of Strategic Sports Ventures in Dallas said that
while using race as a recruiting tool may present an obstacle, it
shouldn't prevent him or other blacks from attracting clients.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of the University of Texas and Whittier College
School of Law, Bowman said he gained invaluable knowledge on how
deals were done when he began his law career working for firms that
represented sports teams, and he will put his expertise to the test
against anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a problem, but the bottom line is, if I trot out my track
record, I think I make it pretty obvious that the quality of the
deals I do for my clients are superior to and certainly no less
than the quality of the deals that other agents are able to deliver
for their clients, be those agents black or white,'' Bowman said.
``So, track record helps. The problem is getting a kid to keep an
open mind until he's had a chance to observe track records and the
other things that ought to be important in making this kind of
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   That decision is made more difficult by black agents who use an
``us-against-them'' tactic to win over players. Despite numbers
that point to the contrary, many think of color as an advantage
black agents have in relating to young athletes, especially the
large percentage that come from the inner city. That is part of the
fear generated by rapper Master P's recent foray into the business
with the formation of No Limit Sports.
</P>
<P>
   But Bowman said that while being black should not cost an agent
clients, it should not be enough to woo them, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I have to be able to do something other than be black
and relate,'' Bowman said. ``If I'm an athlete and an agent comes
to me with a sales pitch composed primarily of, `I'm black, I can
relate to you better than the white agents, here are the guys that
I represent and I can get your deal done,' my response is probably
going to be, `OK, what else you got?' Because that's probably not
going to get it for me. The fact that you're black and you think
that you relate to me better (than a white agent) is just not
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (players) are looking for that sales pitch, I won't get
them. I talk about expertise and experience and being able to
deliver results. Plus I can relate, because I relate well with all
my clients due to some shared experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you show up just black and relating, you ought to lose to
me every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Relating to prospective clients and/or their parents is often
overrated. Bowman said he has had players and parents relate to him
well enough to think of him as a friend, but they still wouldn't
hire him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain comfort level with some players, but it's
offset by the fact that some guys still feel they need somebody
white to represent them,'' Reynolds said. ``Many players don't take
a mature approach in selecting an agent. The criteria by which they
select an agent are very poor in general. That's why you have so
many players that, after a number of years, switch and go from the
next guy to the next guy.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing frequent changes in representation, combined with
regular renegotiations and yearly influx of a new client base, does
is guarantee continued opportunities in the business. Opportunities
black agents hope that more blacks will take advantage of.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future is very bright to the extent that we, as black
agents, don't go out and undermine ourselves,'' Smith said. ``I've
observed a destructive trend that some of us attack each other
because we think that's competition, and it's not. That could dim
the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not compete unfairly. We do not have to fight over
crumbs among us.'' &QL;

Most black agents shy away from America's pastime
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JEROME SOLOMON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There may not be any more exciting time to be involved in the
business of sport than now.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: There is a lot of money to be made.
</P>
<P>
   Television networks are offering billions of dollars for
broadcasting rights, conglomerates are paying hundreds of millions
of dollars to buy franchises, municipalities are fronting hundreds
of millions of dollars to build stadiums, and owners are shelling
out $100 million contracts to players to perform.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of money to go around. Black sports agents are
not getting much of it, but in recent years they have started
getting more of it than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to football and basketball, that is.
</P>
<P>
   In America's pastime, black agents remain far behind the curve.
</P>
<P>
   There are many black agents who have done limited work in
baseball, handling a client or two, but few make baseball a
priority.
</P>
<P>
   There are many theories as to why that is, but most believe it
is simply the nature of the business and the sport.
</P>
<P>
   For one, baseball is just not as popular among blacks as
football and basketball.
</P>
<P>
   The Black Sports Agents Association says blacks make up 70
percent of players in the NBA, 67 percent of players in the NFL and
only 17 percent of players in Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like when you're growing up,'' Larry Reynolds of
Reynolds Sports Management said. ``There are a lot of blacks that
love football and basketball, and those are the sports many black
youth grow up dreaming about becoming stars in.
</P>
<P>
   ``A small percentage of baseball players are black. You can
watch the college baseball world series and count on one hand the
number of black kids on those eight clubs there. Baseball is just
not as popular, and I think that translates into blacks wanting to
become football and basketball agents.''
</P>
<P>
   Things were different for Reynolds, who is from a baseball
family. He played baseball at Stanford and was in the St. Louis
Cardinals' farm system before a knee injury shortened his career.
His brother Harold spent 11 seasons in the big leagues, was a
two-time All-Star and now is an analyst with ESPN, and his brother
Don was also a player and is now a minor-league manager.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Reynolds also coached a year at the Class AA level before
deciding to become an agent.
</P>
<P>
   Now he represents major-leaguers Carl Everett and Ricky
Gutierrez of the Astros; former Astro James Mouton (Montreal);
Kenny Hill (Anaheim), who was one of his first clients; Brian L.
Hunter (Seattle); LaTroy Hawkins (Minnesota); and Torri Hunter
(Minnesota).
</P>
<P>
   He also recently signed Ryan Christianson, who was chosen by
Seattle with the 11th pick in the first round of the amateur draft
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds has been in baseball longer than any other black agent
and may be the lone black agent who has a mostly baseball
clientele.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in baseball since my brother Don was drafted in
1975,'' Reynolds said. ``I love the sport, and it is definitely
where my expertise is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew a lot of players and had a good relationship with a lot
of guys. Plus, my family was known in baseball. It was a
combination of all those things that made it an easier introduction
into the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a few guys trying to get into the industry, but to
get a significant number of clients in the business you have to put
your time in. You may luck up and get one or two players every now
and then, but to really do this thing right, build any kind of
client list, you have to be around, go through a couple of labor
disputes and still be around.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds was joking about staying power through labor disputes,
but it is a valid concern for some agents looking at taking on
baseball clients.
</P>
<P>
   Agents are not nearly as anxious to do baseball thanks to the
impending labor war that is expected to come when the collective
bargaining agreement ends in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   And that opens the door to another major influence on blacks not
entering the business en masse _ money. The money is there, just as
it is in professional basketball and football, but it takes longer
to get to it.
</P>
<P>
   While lucrative contracts for star players are comparable to
those of other sports, second- and third-year players who show
potential don't hit the jackpot like they do in the NBA and NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Houstonian Alan Hendricks, one of baseball's power agents whose
lengthy client list includes Roger Clemens, Chuck Knoblauch, Andy
Pettitte, Jose Cruz Jr., Kerry Woods and Davis' Carl Crawford, said
he advises young attorneys interested in becoming agents _
regardless of their race _ to look to football and basketball if
they want to pay the bills in a timely manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lead time in baseball _ before a player reaches star
status or signs that first big contract _ that's why young agents
tend to gravitate toward the money sports,'' said Hendricks, a
white agent who heads Hendricks Sports Management. ``The bonuses
and big contracts are in the NBA and the NFL _ that's the deal,
that's the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendricks notes that all agents are not out to make a fast buck
but adds that time is money and the amount of time it takes to
build a reputation as a good baseball agent with a strong stable of
clients might not be worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is I'm not going to spend an inordinate amount
of time sitting in the stands at a high school baseball game,
because that's not the best use of my time, nor is it a good way to
represent the clients that I currently represent,'' said Randy
Bowman, a Dallas-based attorney whose client list is composed
almost exclusively of basketball players and coaches. ``I take care
of the guys that I currently have instead of spending all of my
time, as some agents do, trying to find the next crop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lawyer in me says that if a high school player needs
representation in an area where I have expertise, like sports, then
I am the best person for the job, so I don't have anything against
representing them. But the process by which you come to represent
them, having to sink all that time into recruiting them and wooing
them, I'm not going to do that. My relationships have to form a
little more naturally than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowman has represented a baseball player in the past, but that
was by referral. That is the story with most of the black agents
who handle football or basketball players _ they only dabble in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds hopes to see more blacks join him in the business,
though more young whites ask him about entering the business than
young blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call it trailblazing, but I hope I can be helpful
in encouraging more black agents into coming into baseball,'' he
said. ``I'd just like to see (players) have a wider range of
choices in agents. I think black agents could do well in the sport,
and not because of race, but because there are a lot of talented
young people out there who could get the job done.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't the type of job that you can go to school and say,
`I want to learn how to be a sports agent.' It takes time to build
up reputation. Guys build up reputations, some positive, some
negative, but you learn along the way.'' &QL;

NBA SEASON IS SHORT AND SWEET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You came back. Admit it now. You feigned indignation, played
cool with indifference, gave lip service to actual anger.
</P>
<P>
   Then the NBA started its season and you came running back.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's work stoppage in 1994 brought it to its sporting
knees. Fans cursed, cried heresy, filled newspapers and the airways
with rage, and then when baseball returned, stayed away in huge
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA has a lockout that postpones the season's start three
months, sees the greatest star in its history retire, and its
faithful act like it almost never happened.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball fans made like the scorned lover, basketball's the
wide-eyed school boy given another chance by his true love.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that we're very lucky that our fans are as forgiving
as they have turned out to be,'' said NBA commissioner David Stern.
</P>
<P>
   After the league and players reached a collective bargaining
agreement, the NBA braced for the worst. Naysayers pointed to a
truncated, hastily designed 50-game season without Michael Jordan
and predicted Armageddon.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of the regular season, both attendance and
television ratings were down only marginally.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA averaged 16,738 fans per game this season, down just
percentage points from last season's 17,135 per game. The regular
season NBC ratings only dropped from 4.6 last season to 4.3 this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball, meanwhile, is still trying to fully
recover from its 1994 troubles. Baseball was averaging 31,612 fans
per game when its season came to an abrupt halt five years ago. The
next year, its average fell to 25,260 per game. It has grown slowly
each season since, but even in last year's supposed home-run
inspired season of rebirth, attendance was up to only 29,285.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of reasons are promoted for why the NBA enjoyed an almost
seamless return: The NBA utilized a smart public relations
campaign; its sophisticated fans recognized a workable agreement;
new stars ignited interest; and if losing Jordan was an historic
blow, it did leave a more open playing field.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the biggest reason may simply be in the very nature of the
NBA. Its regular season is a prolonged prelude to the playoffs. If
the NBA lost some prelude, baseball lost its grand finale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were lucky in two respects,'' Stern said. ``Number one, our
work stoppage cost us the beginning of the season and not the end.
That's important. And number two, our work stoppage resulted in an
agreement that the fans recognized was really a good-faith attempt
by both sides to deal with seemingly retractable problems. I think
that was not the perception coming out of the baseball strike.''
</P>
<P>
   After the agreement was reached, the NBA went into PR mode.
Teams were required to open a scrimmage to fans and have a free
exhibition game. Players and coaches were encouraged to become more
involved in the community. Every regular-season game had $10
tickets available.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there had never been a work stoppage in the NBA before,
and there could be no certainty as to how the fans would react. The
fans, too, seemed unsure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was angry at the start because they were out so long,'' said
Ryan Davidson, 22, a student and linebacker at Pierce College,
while watching a playoff game at B.J.'s Chicago Pizzeria in
Woodland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost forgot basketball was around. When it came back
without Jordan, it was like a whole, strange season. Then I started
liking some of the young players coming up. The new faces kind of
brought basketball back again.''
</P>
<P>
   Locally, the Lakers made it difficult for the old followers to
turn away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a Laker fan, it was hard not to get sucked back into
it,'' Keith Dardic, 41, a TV commercial producer, said at Yankee
Doodles. ``The whole season played out like a Greek tragedy or an
opera.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a certain alienation during the lockout. But the bad
feelings go away once the season starts up again.''
</P>
<P>
   And if the short regular season cost the NBA financially, it
wasn't necessarily a problem for fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a little more interesting with less games,''
college student Nima Ourmazdi, 23, said at the TGIFriday's in
Woodland Hills. ``It's always more interesting during the playoffs
anyway. It's not any fun for players on teams 15 games out by
midseason.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the Michael Factor. Jordan had dominated the NBA
like no player before him, transcending the sport to become one of
the most recognized personalities in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone realized he would be missed, it was only the severity
and ultimate impact on the game that was uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some practice,'' Stern said. ``We had two years without
him before, so we definitely knew the world as we knew it would not
end. It would be somewhat diminished, but in an interesting kind of
way, we expected it to be far better than the last time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time the focus was sort of on existing stars. This
time, the focus was on existing stars and a new generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant, Allen Iverson, Jason Williams, Tim Duncan, Kevin
Garnett, Vince Carter, Stephon Marbury _ suddenly the NBA seemed
awash in bright young talent that before may have been diminished
in Jordan's shadow.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a special group of young players this season, that
everyone had every reason to dislike, that ultimately made you
watch them and respect them,'' Wise said. ``Whether it was Jason
Williams freezing people in mid air, or Vince Carter just throwing
down the most vicious dunk known to mankind _ a group of young
players really set the tone for an evolving NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NBA this season to me has been about almost the birth, or
the acceptance of the counter-culture hero. You might not like some
of the things that have happened in Latrell Sprewell's and Allen
Iverson's lives, but if you can't enjoy what they can do on the
floor, then you're not a basketball fan.''
</P>
<P>
   This evolving NBA continued to receive good ratings in the
playoffs, despite several sweeps. Leading into the prime time
telecasts, the playoffs received a 5.8 rating to last year's 6.1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went into this season with our eyes wide open and realistic
about what to expect,'' said Ed Markey, an NBC spokesman. ``But it
turned out our ratings were close in the regular season, and even
in the playoffs. Considering everything, we feel great.''
</P>
<P>
   The bigger test of life without Jordan came as the playoffs
moved into prime time, particularly with the Finals. Jordan could
draw the casual fan. Last year, it what was anticipated to be his
last season, the Finals drew a record 18.7 rating. Although the
overall ratings for this year's Finals won't be out until early
next week, the first four games were down about 35 percent from
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is, significant numbers tuned in with great
intensity to see what we would call Michael's last dance,'' Stern
said. ``Here you have the player perhaps of the century, certainly
of our sport and maybe all sports, taking one last turn around the
track. That was an enormous magnet to attract attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you put this season in context of the last 10 years,
this season is going to turn out to be just fine, thank you.''

JACOBS WILL GO FOR DOUBLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KIRBY LEE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. _ Regina Jacobs is still unsure whether the 1,500
or 5,000 meters is her best event. So the three-time Olympian opted
for a simple yet grueling solution in the USA Track &AMP; Field
Championships.
</P>
<P>
   She has decided to run in both events.
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old completed the first half of the double Saturday,
clocking a world-leading and meet record 4 minutes, 2.41 seconds to
win her eighth national metric mile title before a Hayward Field
crowd of 9,149.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, a 1981 graduate of Argyll Academy now known as Campbell
Hall, will run in the 5,000-meter final today. In last year's
championships, Jacobs opted for the 5,000 and won her first
national title at the 3.1-mile distance. Jacobs later went on to
set the American record of 14:52.49.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't chosen (the 1,500 or the 5,000), that's why I am
running tomorrow,'' said Jacobs, rolling her eyes upward.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, who now lives in Oakland, will be favored in today's
5,000 final. The race will include Amy Skieresz of Agoura, a
seven-time NCAA champion in cross country and track at Arizona.
Skieresz missed the collegiate track season after she was diagnosed
with a benign tumor in her femur.
</P>
<P>
   Deena Drossin, a 1991 Agoura graduate and two-time defending
national cross country champion, was third in the 10,000 in a
career-best 32:00.72. Libbie Hickman won in a meet-record 31:43.33
and Anne-Marie Lauck was second in 31:43.50.
</P>
<P>
   The men's and women's 200 with Maurice Greene and Marion Jones
will culminate the final day of the four-day meet that serves as a
qualifier for the World Championships. The top three finishers in
each event advance to the competition in Seville, Spain in August.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, who set the world 100-meter record of 9.79 two weeks
ago, and Jones, the 1998 world leader in the 100, 200 and long
jump, were semifinal heat winners in wind-aided 20.11 and 22.31.
</P>
<P>
   A showdown between Greene and world 200 record holder Michael
Johnson, however, was short-circuited when Johnson pulled out of
the competition on Friday after straining his quadriceps in
training. Rohsaan Griffin, the 1999 indoor champion, won the other
semifinal in a wind-aided 19.96.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, competing for the first time since injuring her right
knee in the Pontiac Grand Prix on June 12, is hoping to rebound in
the 200 after suffering her first loss to an American since 1987 in
finishing second in the long jump on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the best time in the world, but I made it through,''
Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Young defended his 400-meter title in 44.24 to defeat
1991 world champion Antonio Pettigrew with the second fastest-time
in the world. Pettigrew was second in 44.59 and Jerome Davis of
USC, the 1999 Pac-10 Track Athlete of the Year, was third in 44.91.
</P>
<P>
   In the women's hurdles, Joanna Hayes of UCLA finished third in
the 400 hurdles in 55.76 after world-record holder Kim Batten fell
after hitting the eighth hurdle. Sandra Glover and Michelle Johnson
were second and third in 54.95 and 55.53.
</P>
<P>
   But there was little drama in the women's 1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs strung out the field with a 60.9 opening quarter and
stretched her lead to 15 meters by 800 meters passed in 2:07.1 on
her way to dipping under Mary Slaney's 1983 meet record of 4:03.37
set in 1981. Stephanie Best finished more than six seconds back at
4:08.53 and Shayne Culpepper was third in 4:08.69.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what my plan was at the beginning of the race, and
based on that plan, I knew I wouldn't have company,'' Jacobs said.
``I knew I could use the crowd's energy to push me.''

EARLY FIREWORKS FOR RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-WHITE SOX-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Red Sox had their fun at Pedro Martinez's expense
the night before, taping him to a dugout post.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday afternoon, they continued their hijinks, only this time
no one benefitted more than the Red Sox ace. Martinez's 14th win of
the season was assured in the first inning, when the Sox scored 11
times en route to a 17-1 drilling of the Chicago White Sox before a
sun-splashed crowd of 32,758 in Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   This was not a day for showing up late, though even the tardy
arrivals could have shown up a half-hour into the game and still
caught the bottom of the first. First pitch of the game: 4:08 p.m.
Last out of the first: 4:44.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just playing for one run at first,'' said rookie Brian
Daubach, who hit a three-run home run off White Sox starter James
Baldwin to start the score-o-rama, then singled in another run on
his next turn, setting a personal best for RBIs in a game before
the Sox had made three outs. ``When we got three, with Pedro
pitching, you kind of figure you've got a good lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it kept going and going. It was unreal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, in tying a club record for runs in their first at-bat
set 66 years before, paraded 14 batters to the plate in the first
inning, when they hit two home runs, four doubles, and three
singles and also had two walks. The first three batters in the
order _ Jose Offerman, Lou Merloni, and Daubach _ all reached
safely twice in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Offerman doubled and walked, Merloni singled and hit a three-run
double that missed being a grand slam by a couple of feet, and
Daubach had his ninth home run, his second in two games, and an RBI
single.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that doesn't happen very often,'' said Mike
Stanley, who doubled and homered. ``So people just keep shaking
their heads and want to get back up there and hit again.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, who made the only out among the
first seven Sox batters when he struck out, hit a two-run home run
on his second go-round in the inning to cap the 11-run outburst,
then hit a three-run home run in the third inning on his next
at-bat. He didn't need a note from his doctor to convince anyone
he's fine after missing two games with a strained groin.
</P>
<P>
   In the day's most astonishing show of chutzpah, Baldwin actually
appeared to throw a fit when fetched by White Sox manager Jerry
Manuel after walking No. 9 hitter Trot Nixon with six runs already
in, flinging his chew and stalking off to the back of the mound
before handing the ball to his manager.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, winning for the 10th time in their last 13 games, hit
five home runs in all in erupting for their biggest offensive
showing since Aug. 5, 1997, when they beat the Rangers in Texas,
17-1.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, in his easiest tuneup yet for his all-but-official
All-Star start here on July 13, was dismissed after five easy
innings, giving way to John Wasdin, who breezed through four
hitless innings against the Chicagoans resigned to their fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely the Pedro express,'' said Chicago strongman
Frank Thomas, who struck out in both of his appearances against
Martinez. ``He's not overrated at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a special, special pitcher. He threw me nine pitches and
they were all unhittable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like he has a special edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who struck out four, walked one, and gave up three
hits, including a home run by rookie Chris Singleton in the second,
now has won his last three starts to go to 14-2, with two starts
left before the break. The last two pitchers to have had 15 wins
before the break both had Red Sox ties, Roger Clemens and Bret
Saberhagen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of who the starter was that was in there,'' manager
Jimy Williams said, ``he's probably going to come out in a game
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's only dilemma Saturday came when he went to the mound
before the game, when he had to choose which ball with which to
warm up. Inexplicably, there were four baseballs strewn around the
mound.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, playing without third baseman John Valentin, still
woozy after being beaned the night before, batted around for the
second time this season in jumping on the White Sox. Merloni, who
has started games at short, second, and third this week, singled
after Offerman's leadoff double, then hit a bases-loaded double on
his second at-bat in the inning, clearing the bases and missing a
grand slam by a couple of feet.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox' five home runs matched their season high, as Stanley
and Jason Varitek hit back-to-back home runs off Chicago reliever
Scott Eyre leading off the fourth. Varitek also had two doubles,
giving him four doubles in two games.
</P>
<P>
   Every batter in the Boston lineup had at least one hit except
for outfielder Darren Lewis, who went hitless in five trips. The
Sox had nine extra-base hits, with four doubles in addition to the
five homers.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who last week posted a sign above his locker advising
reporters that he wouldn't be talking that day, posted another
missive after the game Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good today, both physically and mentally,'' he said.
``The day belongs to my teammates for their offensive production.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you,
</P>
<P>
   Pedro.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, to make sure no one could possibly misinterpret his
absence, Martinez added one word and circled it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love.''

BOSTON T PARTY: TRADES, TWINS, TIRADE 
</HEADLINE>
 DRAFT-ANALYSIS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Known the world over for its Tea Party, Boston Saturday
took its place in National Hockey League annals as the town of
Trades and Twins in the league's final entry draft of the 20th
Century.
</P>
<P>
   The twins, star Swedish lookalikes Daniel and Henrik Sedin, were
selected by the Vancouver Canucks, who were at the center of the
league's busiest and biggest trade meet in history.
</P>
<P>
   The clubs with the top four picks _ Tampa, Atlanta, Vancouver,
and Chicago _ opened the afternoon on Causeway Street with a series
of interlocking deals that left Vancouver with the Sedins (picks
Nos. 2 and 3), Atlanta with promising forward Patrik Stefan (the
No. 1 pick), and the Rangers with Pavel Brendl (No. 4).
</P>
<P>
   Few hockey fans this side of Flin Flon know anything about
99-plus percent of the draftees. A precious few will turn into the
league's leaders in the next century. As of Saturday, they were
simply wide-eyed kids with dreams of fame and fortune. An
overwhelming percentage never will play a shift, even in a league
that adds franchises faster than McDonald's (as of next October it
will the Original 30, with billions and billions served).
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, selecting 21st overall, chose a 20-year-old
defenseman, Nick Boynton, who this spring was arrested on assault
charges for allegedly aiding a teammate in the beating of a cab
driver outside an Ottawa bar. According to newspaper accounts,
Boynton's teammmate, Mark Bell, was arrested at the scene. Boynton,
alleged to have fled the scene, wasn't collared until four days
later, the arrest made after police telephoned his home and asked
him to come in or face the prospect of being taken into custody in
his home.
</P>
<P>
   Boynton said Saturday that no charges remain pending. He also
added that he learned from the experience. It could not immediately
be learned if the charge was dropped, or otherwise settled.
</P>
<P>
   The draft, never before held in the Hub, got rolling shortly
after noon when Bruins president and general manager Harry Sinden
stepped to the podium and was soundly booed by the hometown crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spend some money, Harry!'' bellowed one leatherlung.
</P>
<P>
   The locals have grown restless after 27 years without a Stanley
Cup, and Sinden, in their eyes, is now the President Pinata. The
primary overseer of one of the league's great budget operations,
and biggest profit-makers, Sinden long ago became the focal point
of the faithful fans' ire.
</P>
<P>
   After enduring the embarrassing Bronx cheer from the crowd of
some 8,000, Sinden sardonically referenced the ``warm and loving''
greeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll always remember it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sinden then quickly handed the proceedings over to team captain
Ray Bourque. Never has one of his teammates been so glad to let
Bourque lug the puck.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Burke, the Harvard-trained attorney who a year ago became
the Canucks GM, sounded like a Wild West gunslinger when describing
the events leading up to his landing the Sedins.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one was leaving with the twins but us,'' said Burke.
</P>
<P>
   Only 18 years old, the Sedins made it clear months ago that they
don't plan to play in North America this season. They made it
equally clear that their preference was to be drafted by the same
club. Like most all athletes in the '90s, they got their wish. It
is now up to Burke to sign them and try to convince them that
beautiful British Columbia is the place they want to be. It
shouldn't be a tough sell. They'll both be guaranteed $3
million-plus for three years of work, with the chance to double
their earnings through performance incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay boss Rick Dudley was the key behind-the-scenes
orchestrator of the high-profile moves that kicked off the draft.
He made the daring decision to give up the No. 1 overall pick in a
deal that brought him two Rangers, goalie Dan Cloutier and left
wing Niklas Sundstrom. The Cloutier-Sundstrom acquistions finally
should make the Bolts competitive in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Once Dudley budged on the No. 1, the rest of the moves fell into
place, with Atlanta moving up from No. 2 to No. 1, Vancouver adding
the No. 2 pick to its No. 3, and the Rangers slotting into
Chicago's original No. 4 spot. The Blackhawks picked up Vancouver
defenseman Bryan McCabe in the swap and also the Canucks'
first-round pick in either 2000 or 2001. The entire convoluted
transaction came together only some 10 minutes before the
selections began.

   Former Boston defenseman Mike Milbury, who made the fifth,
eighth, and 10th picks for the Islanders, was at his seething best
when addressing reporters under the Vault's stands. Milbury was
incensed by what he depicted as a runaround by Rich Winter, agent
for Stefan, who was picked No. 1 overall by Atlanta. Stefan had two
concussions during the season while playing with the Long Beach Ice
Dogs of the IHL, and Milbury said he never could get a documented
answer from Stefan or Winter about the center's neurological
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Milbury labeled Winter a ``disgrace,'' said his actions were
``despicable,'' and accused him of ``scurrilous behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of the diatribe, Milbury spotted a familiar face
among the Boston media, interrupted his salty soliloquy, and said,
``How do you think I'm doin'?''
</P>
<P>
   Twins, trades, and a tirade. What could be better?

FROG HEAVEN: TCU WAS FRUGAL BUT FEROCIOUS IN '50S FOOTBALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   About midday on an autumn afternoon in 1954, a train made an
unscheduled stop in Norman, Okla., and discharged a rather unusual
cargo. Hopping off the train at a remote siding a few hundred yards
from the Oklahoma Sooners' massive stadium was the TCU football
team, running a bit late.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got off the train, carrying all our gear, and started
walking toward the stadium,'' recalls Buddy Dike, TCU's fullback.
``It was two oat fields away. We crossed those fields, climbed one
or two fences _ I don't remember which _ and walked into the
stadium, which was packed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oklahoma had already finished its warmups, and we went into
the dressing room and put on our gear as fast as we could. We
nearly missed the kickoff.''
</P>
<P>
   Awaiting the Horned Frogs was a juggernaut on the verge of
back-to-back national championships and in the midst of a historic
47-game winning streak. Never in that entire span did Bud
Wilkinson's legendary Sooners stand as close to defeat as they did
that day.
</P>
<P>
   With a sophomore-laden team _ the second in the 14-year tenure
of a folksy coach named Othol ``Abe'' Martin _ the Frogs rocked the
Sooners back on their heels and stymied the OU option with a weird
4-4 defense concocted by the athletic director, former coach Dutch
Meyer. Two long fourth-quarter punt returns by Buddy Leake finally
delivered a 21-16 win to the Big Red.
</P>
<P>
   TCU lost, in part, because captain Johnny Crouch informed the
officials that Ken Wineburg had trapped _ not caught _ an end-zone
pass that had already been ruled a touchdown. It was '50s football,
and the Frogs would beat you square or not at all.
</P>
<P>
   It was an era in which TCU produced nine All-Americans and five
nationally ranked teams, including four in the Top 10 and one
(1955) ranked fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``A very different era, and a much simpler one,'' says Frank
Windegger, a sophomore on that '54 team who subsequently spent 40
years as coach and administrator at TCU, including 24 as AD.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the two biggest things around here then were TCU
football and the Fort Worth Cats baseball team,'' Windegger
recalls. ``Around the state, all the news coverage was about the
Southwest Conference. There was no professional football in Texas,
and television had not become a major factor. Schools ran their
entire operation on gate receipts, and budgets were well under $1
million. Donor money was not a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, it was the one-platoon era, which meant that the
(smaller) private schools could compete equally.''
</P>
<P>
   A salient aspect of the program was an impressive nonconference
record against a collection of national heavies, including twin
20-7 wins by the '54 team against Rose Bowl-bound Southern
California and Eastern power Penn State, led by the first two black
players to perform in Amon Carter Stadium _ Lenny Moore and
Roosevelt Grier.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's first team in '53 lost a 26-19 decision to defending
national champion Michigan State, which went on to win the Rose
Bowl. And Ohio State's Rose Bowl champions had to share the '57
national title with Auburn because of one blemish _ an 18-14 loss
to TCU.
Ever-frugal
</P>
<P>
   TCU's accomplishments came frugally _ the Frogs negotiated oat
fields and fences, Dike recalls, ``Because Dutch always had this
deal about putting us on a train when we traveled and having us
spend the night on the train so he could save hotel money. But in
this case, the train was two hours late leaving Fort Worth, and he
had to talk the conductor into putting us off on a siding.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also accomplished through skillful recruiting and the
remarkable character of Martin _ the ``Jacksboro Philosopher'' _ a
man full of pithy warmth and wisdom whose standard promo of an
impending big game was, ``Aw, we gonna have us a sheep-shearin' out
here come Saturday, yew bet.''
</P>
<P>
   Expressing his philosopy of command in a letter to Windegger
years later, Martin wrote, ``There is never much happiness to be
found in a program of tough discipline, where all are nobodies
except the head man.''
</P>
<P>
   Another '54 soph, Chuck Curtis, was a widely sought quarterback
from Paris who committed to TCU and then began having second
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oklahoma was offering me some things, and I pretty much
decided to go there, when Coach Martin showed up at my house,''
Curtis recalled. ``We went out and sat in a swing on the front
porch to talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he says, `Chuck-a-Luck, you remember that the last time we
talked, you said you were coming to TCU?'
</P>
<P>
   ``And I said, `Yeah, coach, but ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``And he slaps me on the knee and says, `Well, good, I just
wanted to make sure we were straight on that.' And he gets up and
gets back in his car and drives off ... leaving me sitting there on
the porch, swinging.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in that class was a halfback from Rusk that TCU had taken
on the word of assistant Allie White, who said he had good moves _
on a basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, Jim Swink became the most devastating offensive weapon
in college football, averaging 8.2 yards per carry while rushing
for 1,283 yards and scoring 20 touchdowns, including a 235-yard
effort in a 47-20 rout of Texas. He finished second in the voting
for the Heisman Trophy, leading TCU to a 9-1 season and the SWC
title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a little ol' rubber-legged outfit that nobody can
catch,'' said Abe, when questioned about his star.
`Hurricane Game'
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, TCU harbored dreams of a national title. But on a dark
afternoon in College Station, they blew away in a storm.
</P>
<P>
   Billed as a showdown of unbeatens _ TCU was 3-0 with a No. 4
national ranking, Texas A&AMP;M was unbeaten with a tie _ it has
instead been remembered as the ``Hurricane Game'' for a bizarre
gale that struck in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   TCU threatened repeatedly, held a wide statistical edge, and
lost, 7-6, when the Aggies finally mustered an 80-yard,
fourth-quarter drive. By that time, the Frogs had missed two field
goals, had a TD called back, lost a fumble at the A&AMP;M 2, and thrown
an interception in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   As TCU launched its first drive, the early afternoon sky had
turned pitch black. Rain _ and then hail _ was falling in
horizontal sheets, the light standards at Kyle Field were swaying
like palm trees, and small aircraft at the nearby airport were
being overturned. Most of the capacity crowd of 42,000 was huddled
under the stands, and the wind, Swink recalled, ``was so strong you
had to turn your head to breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of it all, TCU hammered at the A&AMP;M goal.
Ultimately, the game hinged on two disputed plays, when the Frogs _
to this day _ say Swink scored and the officials said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``On one, I led the play through the hole and wound up lying in
the end zone,'' Dike says. ``Swink was lying on top of me,
clutching my shirt tail. The official closest to the play signaled
touchdown _ but another one, with rain splattering his glasses so
he couldn't even see, came running up and said no score.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis figured he could have saved everyone the trouble by
calling a bootleg on the second play.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were stacked to stop Swink, and I could have walked into
the end zone,'' he said. ``But I was afraid to change the play
because the hail was bouncing off our helmets so hard that no one
could hear me.''
</P>
<P>
   With A&AMP;M on probation, the second-place Frogs consoled
themselves with a Cotton Bowl victory over a Syracuse team led by
Jim Brown. Rebuilding in '57, they upset Ohio State in a game
fueled by Jim Shofner's 90-yard punt return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember that when we came off the field in that game, those
people up there were cheering us,'' recalls Hunter Enis. ``They
were just great fans who appreciated someone playing a good game.''
A green pea called Lilly
</P>
<P>
   As the starting quarterback in '58, Enis directed the Frogs to
an 8-2 season, an SWC title, and _ unsuspected by anyone at the
time _ what has been their last Cotton Bowl appearance, a scoreless
tie with Air Force on a muddy field.
</P>
<P>
   In moments of stress, Enis was often comforted by old pal
Sherrill Headrick, a ferocious guard-linebacker who occasionally
hummed the Lone Ranger theme while chasing down ball-carriers.
Before a big game, he would drape a fatherly arm over the
quarterback's shoulders and say, ``Remember, we got this game won _
unless you mess it up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs also displayed a large, mobile sophomore tackle named
Bob Lilly, fetched from Oregon by a recruiting letter from Allie
White.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a big ol' green pea,'' said Abe, ``but he'll stand in
there for you like a picket fence.''
</P>
<P>
   More like a bridge abutment. Lilly, a 1960 All-American and
eventual Pro Football Hall of Fame selectee, grew up in
Throckmorton, but the family had moved to Oregon because of a
severe drought.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time we left Throckmorton, there were only about 1,200
people left, and we just couldn't make it,'' Lilly recalled. ``but
I wanted to play for TCU, so when the letter came I grabbed the
chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a freshman, I was 1,700 miles away from my parents,
and my dad had a heart attack. He eventually recovered, but it was
pretty rough for a while. Abe just took me under his wing like I
was one of his own kids, and became like a second father to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved playing for Abe, and later for Tom Landry. They were
very much alike _ two gentlemen, good for their word, who had
tremendous character and integrity. I learned a lot about life from
each of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Known for a time as ``The Purple Cloud'' after landing on an
unfortunate quarterback in an end zone that had been dusted with
purple chalk, Lilly also became a figure of awe on campus after
holding up the rear end of a car while a student without a jack
replaced a flat tire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aw, it was just a little ol' Renault,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With Lilly, All-Americans Don Floyd and Jack Spikes, and swift
halfback Harry Moreland, the '59 Frogs went 8-2, closing with seven
consecutive wins and a No. 7 national ranking.
</P>
<P>
   The final image of TCU's decade of greatness is that of Moreland
running 56 yards on a field recently cleared of ice with the score
that felled previously unbeaten Texas, 14-9. The Frogs shared the
title with Texas and Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, three professional football teams arrived in
Texas, and the NCAA soon passed legislation that would do away with
the one-platoon system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Abe telling me at the time,'' Lilly said, ``that
this would be end of the private schools.''

THE FIRST TIME: WHAT WAS NEW IN THE 1950s 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
The first time Shot clock in basketball: The NBA adopted a
24-second shot clock for the 1954-55 season on the advice of
Syracuse Nationals owner Danny Biasone. The goal? Increase the
action, and the scoring, which it did. ``It was the single most
important rule change in the last 50 years,'' Boston Celtics
president Red Auerbach said. Celtics star Bob Cousy said, ``I think
it saved the NBA at that time. It allowed the game to breathe and
progress.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two-platoon football: On Jan. 20, 1950, the modern era of
professional football began when the NFL approved free
substitution, paving the way for two-platoon football and
specialization. Two-way players were still common throughout much
of the '50s, but gradually dwindled until becoming all but extinct
in 1962, when Philadelphia's Chuck Bednarik _ the last full-time
two-way player _ retired.
</P>
<P>
   Sports Illustrated: On Aug. 16, 1954, the sports magazine
debuted. It was aimed at the American middle-class consumer and the
budding TV sports spectator. The magazine reflected a move from
active participation to spectator status for many Americans. It
also became a leader in investigative and serious reporting of the
sports scene.
</P>
<P>
   The American Football League: On Aug. 14, 1959, Dallas
millionaire Lamar Hunt brought six other wealthy men to Chicago to
discuss the formation of a new pro football league to compete with
the established NFL. Eight days later, the formation of the AFL was
announced, with franchises in Dallas, Houston, Denver, Minneapolis,
Los Angeles and New York and play scheduled to begin in 1960. Two
more teams _ Buffalo and Boston _ would be added later in the year,
and the Minnesota franchise was replaced by Oakland. The league's
first draft _ the first shot in a long and bitter war that
eventually ended in a merger _ was held on Nov. 22. It lasted 33
rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Face protection: Facemasks on football helmets were introduced
in the early part of the decade, evolving from a single bar to a
clear plastic shield to multiple bars. By the end of the '50s,
facemasks were standard equipment. On Nov. 1, 1959, Montreal's
Jacques Plante became the first NHL goalie to wear a mask as part
of his regular equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Widening the free-throw lane: Because of the increasing
dominance of big men such as George Mikan, the NBA widened the
free-throw lane from 6 to 12 feet for the 1951-52 season in order
to move the taller players farther from the basket. College
basketball followed suit for the 1956-57 season.
</P>
<P>
   The run-and-shoot: Four wide receivers might seem like a modern
concept, but it was first used by the Los Angeles Rams of the early
'50s. The Rams split halfbacks Elroy Hirsch and Glenn Davis wide
along with ends Tom Fears and Vitamin T. Smith to take advantage of
strong-armed quarterbacks Norm Van Brocklin and Bob Waterfield.
Using the wide-open offense, the Rams won the 1951 NFL title. On
Sept. 28, 1951, Van Brocklin passed for 554 yards, a single-game
record that still stands.
</P>
<P>
   TV blackouts: After the Los Angeles Rams televised all of their
games in 1950, attendance dropped by 50 percent. When the Rams
blacked out their home games in 1951, attendance doubled. NFL
commissioner Bert Bell became convinced that the league needed to
act as a single negotiating unit when TV contracts were involved.
When the league owners made him director of NFL television in 1952,
he instituted a leaguewide blackout rule covering teams' home
games.

BRUINS BANKING ON BOYNTON 
</HEADLINE>
 DRAFT-BRUINS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Bruins worked on moving up in the NHL draft at the
FleetCenter Saturday but remained at No. 21 and chose defenseman
Nick Boynton of the Memorial Cup-champion Ottawa 67s.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of factors in Boynton's favor, but there are
also some negatives. Bruins assistant general manager Mike
O'Connell said the team weighed all the pros and cons and went with
Boynton, hoping he will provide help in training camp this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Boynton, a 20-year-old native of Nobleton, Ontario, who was the
MVP of this year's Memorial Cup _ the championship of Canadian
junior hockey _ originally was drafted ninth overall in 1997 by the
Washington Capitals. However, Washington couldn't come to terms
with the 6-foot-2-inch, 210-pounder, haggling over a three-year
pact worth $1.4 million, so Capitals management gave the Chicago
Blackhawks permission to negotiate with Boynton just before last
March's trade deadline. No deal was made, and Boynton went back
into the draft pool.
</P>
<P>
   Boston believes he's two years closer to playing than the
18-year-olds available at No. 21. Also, Boynton could play in
Providence if he didn't make the big club, while 18-year-olds would
have to return to their junior teams.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem regarding Boynton, however, was an off-ice
incident April 25 outside a bar called Stoney's in Byward Market in
Ottawa. Boynton and teammate Mark Bell were charged with assault,
accused of beating up a cab driver.
</P>
<P>
   Published reports in Ottawa, which Boynton Saturday termed
``wrong,'' said the cab driver, sitting outside the bar, heard a
thump against his vehicle. Bell and Boynton then got into the cab,
according to reports, and the driver refused to take them anywhere
because he believed they were the ones who hit his car. A fight
reportedly ensued between Bell and the cab driver, and Bell was
arrested. Boynton, who left the scene before police arrived,
reportedly was later identified by witnesses and told that if he
didn't turn himself in, he would be arrested at his home. Another
version of the story, put forth by a source from Ottawa Saturday,
was that Boynton actually went to the aid of Bell after Bell and
the cabbie began fighting and other cab drivers jumped in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty much all been taken care of,'' explained Boynton.
``That's not something I have to worry about anymore. It was
something to learn from. I'm pretty sure (all charges) have been
dropped.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell said the incident was investigated by the team and the
Bruins are satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as we know, it's not a major issue to us,'' said
O'Connell. ``We're just happy to have him.''
</P>
<P>
   Boynton had 11 goals and 59 points in 51 games last season for
Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a terrific defenseman,'' said O'Connell. ``For
us, he was probably the best defenseman who was available in the
draft. He was the Memorial Cup MVP, a first-round pick a couple of
years ago, and he's two years closer to playing than most of these
other kids. With the depth we have on the blue line, we feel he'll
get a chance to play this year for us. If not, he'll play in
Providence, which is a huge plus for us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to take care of my own end first and offense is
second,'' said Boynton, who received his Bruins sweater at the
podium from Ray Bourque. ``If there's a hit, I take it. I try to
play two ways the best I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the draft, he said, ``It's a lot better the second
time around. I'm in awe. I didn't know where I was going to go, and
to go here is just a great feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' pick was met with great hostility by the Blackhawks,
who planned to take Boynton at No. 23. ``We'll see how tough Harry
is going to be,'' said GM Bob Murray. ``If he gets that (the new
cap maximum of $1,025,000), Harry Sinden should be shot. I'm sick
of hearing, `Harry Sinden this' and `Harry Sinden that.' It's about
time Harry Sinden backed up his words. If you're going to talk,
he'd better back it up.''
</P>
<P>
   When told of Murray's comments, Sinden smiled and said he agreed
he should be shot if he offered Boynton the cap maximum.
</P>
<P>
   ``So,'' Sinden said, ``I'm not worrying about being shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said Boynton wouldn't have been there in the 23d spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Chicago) wouldn't have got him anyway,'' said Sinden.
``Philly was going to take him anyway (at 22).''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins will maintain the same philosophy they always have
when it comes to salary negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do what's proper and if it's not enough, we won't sign
him,'' said Sinden. ``When you run the risk of putting yourself
back in the draft, you run certain risks as a player. Agents should
know that. That's the risk he ran. He was drafted ninth and then
with two years more experience, he was drafted later.''
</P>
<P>
   Boynton felt Chicago and Washington didn't make enough of an
effort to sign him. ``The deal from Chicago that was offered to me
wasn't fair for where I went,'' said Boynton. ``I just want a fair
deal. It's not about money. I just want a fair deal and I'm sure it
will be worked out with the Bruins. Washington said they didn't
have the money to sign me. Whether that's true or they just didn't
like me, I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to be ready for this year. I've played four years in
junior and this year we won the Memorial Cup and that's pretty much
it for me in junior. I'd like to make the step right away. I'm
pretty confident that I can.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second round, with the 56th pick, the Bruins took
20-year-old center Matt Zultek. Zultek was another player put back
into the draft because he wasn't able to come to terms by the June
1 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Zultek, who was not in attendance Saturday, was taken No. 15
overall by the Kings in 1997. Although Los Angeles general manager
Dave Taylor went to the wire trying to make a deal, he wasn't
successful. Zultek, a 6-foot-4-inch, 222-pounder, played on the 67s
with Boynton last season and had 33 goals and 66 points in 56
games.

</P>
<P>
   Face protection: Facemasks on football helmets were introduced
in the early part of the decade, evolving from a single bar to a
clear plastic shield to multiple bars. By the end of the '50s,
facemasks were standard equipment. On Nov. 1, 1959, Montreal's
Jacques Plante became the first NHL goalie to wear a mask as part
of his regular equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Widening the free-throw lane: Because of the increasing
dominance of big men such as George Mikan, the NBA widened the
free-throw lane from 6 to 12 feet for the 1951-52 season in order
to move the taller players farther from the basket. College
basketball followed suit for the 1956-57 season.
</P>
<P>
   The run-and-shoot: Four wide receivers might seem like a modern
concept, but it was first used by the Los Angeles Rams of the early
'50s. The Rams split halfbacks Elroy Hirsch and Glenn Davis wide
along with ends Tom Fears and Vitamin T. Smith to take advantage of
strong-armed quarterbacks Norm Van Brocklin and Bob Waterfield.
Using the wide-open offense, the Rams won the 1951 NFL title. On
Sept. 28, 1951, Van Brocklin passed for 554 yards, a single-game
record that still stands.
</P>
<P>
   TV blackouts: After the Los Angeles Rams televised all of their
games in 1950, attendance dropped by 50 percent. When the Rams
blacked out their home games in 1951, attendance doubled. NFL
commissioner Bert Bell became convinced that the league needed to
act as a single negotiating unit when TV contracts were involved.
When the league owners made him director of NFL television in 1952,
he instituted a leaguewide blackout rule covering teams' home
games.

EDMONDS WORKS OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Center fielder Jim Edmonds shagged fly balls in the
outfield at Edison Field on Saturday afternoon but warned, ``It's
very early'' in his recovery from surgery on his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   He also worked out Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like starting spring training,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's workout was conducted by Angels part-time coach Sam
Suplizio. Suplizio, whose specialty is working with outfielders,
had Edmonds working on getting good jumps as the ball came off the
bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all the time he has not been playing, his instincts are
still sharp,'' Suplizio said. ``And he worked very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds had surgery on April 19 and isn't expected back until
mid-August at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Suplizio was in the news recently when he was banned from the
Angels dugout permanently by the league. Teams are allowed five
coaches on the bench during games, but the rule hadn't been
strictly enforced, allowing Suplizio to make selected trips with
the team.
</P>
<P>
   But in Toronto on the last trip, Blue Jays manager Jim Fregosi
told Suplizio he wasn't going to allow the Angels to have an extra
coach that day. When the American League got word of the story,
they announced the five-coach rule would be strictly enforced.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 35 years in the game, it hurts,'' said Suplizio, who was
still able to crack a joke. ``But I'm getting a mask made.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill update: Ken Hill's status for his next start won't be
decided until today when throws on the side and has his inflamed
right elbow re-evaluated. But he will not start Monday against the
Rangers, his normal turn in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it will be Chuck Finley, who will pitch on three days
rest. Tuesday's starter will either be Hill or a replacement from
the minors. Mike Fhyrie has the best numbers, but he pitched
Friday. Jarrod Washburn, who pitched well against the Rangers last
season, is a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Also: Outfielder Matt Luke had an MRI on Saturday, which
revealed a partial muscle tear in his right rib cage. He is
expected to be placed on the disabled list today.... Pitcher Jack
McDowell, recovering from shoulder surgery Feb. 2, threw a
four-inning simulated game Saturday and felt fine. He'll pitch
another simulated game Wednesday....
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's game was billed as ``Turn ahead the clock night at
Edison Field.'' Both teams wore futuristic uniforms, supposedly
representing the year 2021.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels wore bright red jerseys with the new logo taking up
the entire front of the jersey. Said one Angels player: ``All we
need are red bottoms and we have the perfect pair of pajamas.''...
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Gary DiSarcina is back from injury, and even though
he's off to a slow start offensively (2 for 10 going into
Saturday's game), his presence in the lineup is making a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   With DiSarcina in the lineup, players like Jeff Huson and Andy
Sheets are back where they belong _ coming off the bench and
contributing late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Huson had the game-winning hit Friday and began a late rally
Tuesday in Seattle. Sheets made a standout defensive play in the
ninth inning of Tuesday's game in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doing what they're supposed to do, manager Terry
Collins said. ``And it helps that these guys got a lot of playing
time when Gary was out.''...
</P>
<P>
   The Angels and A's play the final game of their three-game
series today at 5:05 p.m. Steve Sparks (2-5, 5.02 ERA) will start
for Anaheim against Oakland's Kenny Rogers (4-2, 3.80). &QL;

SUMMERALL FORESAW GREATNESS FOR LOMBARDI, LANDRY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the mid-1950s, New York Giants head coach Jim Lee Howell may
have had the easiest job in the NFL. His top offensive assistant
was legend-in-the-making Vince Lombardi. Heading his defense was
another future Hall of Fame coach, Tom Landry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing the head coach did was look at his watch to see
how long before practice was over,'' former Giants player Pat
Summerall recalled. ``He didn't coach much, but with those two guys
around he didn't need to.''
</P>
<P>
   Howell hired Lombardi and Landry soon after taking the Giants
job in 1954 _ Landry was a player-coach that season _ and by 1956,
they had turned a 3-9 team into an NFL champion. New York also
played for the title in 1958 and '59, losing both times to
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   After the '58 season, Lombardi left for Green Bay, where he won
five NFL championships and the first two Super Bowls. The Super
Bowl trophy is named after Lombardi. Landry moved to the expansion
Dallas Cowboys in 1960 and helped build one of the most successful
franchises in sports history over the next three decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were two totally different personalities,S Summerall
said. RLandry was so unreadable. You never knew where you stood
with Landry. With Lombardi, you knew instantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Landry would come in and tell you, `Here's what you're going
to do. Do it my way and we'll win.' And he was usually right.
Lombardi was such a teacher, probably the best teacher I ever had
in anything, not just football. He knew his subject so thoroughly.
You could see he was headed for greatness. Both he and Landry. You
knew they were going places.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lombardi had such command. Before my first practice with the
Giants I went into the offensive team meeting. Some guy was trying
to call roll, but he couldn't get anyone quiet. I was sitting next
to Charley Conerly and we were kind of laughing about it. Then this
other man walked in and just cleared his throat and the whole room
fell silent. I whispered to Conerly, `Who is that?' and he said,
`That's Lombardi, and you'll find out who he is soon enough.''

ANGELS WIN UGLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ You've heard of winning ugly?
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' futuristic jerseys that were part of a ``Turn ahead
the clock night'' promotion Saturday night at Edison Field
certainly won't be featured in fashion magazines any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   And although the jerseys might have strained the eyes of 29,957
in the seats, the Angels felt good inside after beating the Oakland
A's 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   It was their fifth win in their last six games and moved them to
within 7{ games of the AL West-leading Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   One Angels player said a matching pair of red pants would have
made the uniform a ``perfect pair of pajamas.'' Another said the
pants clashed because ``pinstripes will be out in 2021.''
</P>
<P>
   What looked good to the Angels was Gary DiSarcina's two-out,
two-strike, RBI single to right field in the sixth that tied the
game at 4-4 and capped a rally from a 4-0 deficit. And Darin
Erstad's spectacular diving catch of Miguel Tejada's liner to left
in the top of the seventh with the potential go-ahead run on second
base.
</P>
<P>
   And Garret Anderson's RBI single in the seventh that gave the
Angels a 5-4 lead and turned out to be the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   There also was the pitching of relievers Mike Magnante (31/3
scoreless innings) and Shigetoshi Hasegawa to set up closer Troy
Percival (21st save) after starter Tim Belcher left the game with a
sprained finger after four innings. Belcher went for X-rays after
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys did a tremendous job,'' Angels manager Terry
Collins said, ``starting with Mike Magnante. To come in and have to
shut them down like he did _ he did a tremendous job. I really
think that's the ballgame right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher tagged out Ryan Christenson in a play at the plate,
ending a rundown to close out the fourth inning. He was initially
diagnosed with a sprained pinky finger on his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   While Belcher was knocked out of the game by injury, it didn't
hurt the Angels' chances Saturday. Signs that Belcher was off his
game were evident early. With two out in the first, Belcher fell
behind in the count to Ben Grieve, then grooved a 3-1 pitch that
Grieve sent into the right-field seats.
</P>
<P>
   In the second inning, Belcher walked three batters but got help
from his defense.
</P>
<P>
   With two on and nobody out, Mike MacFarlane hit one to the
center-field fence. But Anderson made a leaping catch and doubled
up Matt Stairs at first via a relay by second baseman Randy
Velarde. The Angels nearly got a triple play out of it, but the
throw to second to get John Jaha was late.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher didn't escape so easily in the third inning, yielding a
three-run homer to Jason Giambi for a 4-0 A's lead. Belcher worked
his way out of a fourth-inning jam but couldn't make it out for the
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels climbed back in on an RBI single by Velarde in the
third inning and a two-run fourth, highlighted by Steve Decker's
RBI double and Orlando Palmeiro's RBI single to cut their deficit
to 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   That set up the game-tying and game-winning hits by DiSarcina
and Anderson, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he's still in spring-training shape,'' Collins said of
DiSarcina. ``But this guy has a knack of getting big hits. He just
does it. I wish I knew what his thought process is. He just gets
big hits.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's hit came only a week or so after he was mired in a
0-for-30 slump.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just come out and keep playing,'' Anderson said. ``You go
about things the right way and good things will happen
eventually.''

ATLANTA THRASHES AROUND 
</HEADLINE>
 DRAFT-THRASHERS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Ted Turner _ surprise, surprise _ once again got top
billing.
</P>
<P>
   New to the National Hockey League, enamored with the relatively
unknown Georgia state bird, the thrasher, Turner already had gotten
his way by naming his newly hatched team the Thrashers.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever Turner was, he probably just shrugged when word out of
the FleetCenter was that Atlanta had acquired the top pick in
Saturday's NHL draft. Turner, after all, has been on top before.
</P>
<P>
   But two men at the FleetCenter did much more than shrug Saturday
afternoon. Patrik Stefan, the Thrashers' top choice, understandably
was ecstatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, you know, it's unbelievable,'' said the 18-year-old
center from the Czech Republic who came to the United States two
years ago with perhaps five words of English in his vocabulary. ``I
am so excited, so happy to be No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Stefan had bolted up to the FleetCenter podium, sporting the
widest of smiles. The smiles of Atlanta vice president and general
manager Don Waddell and president Harvey Schiller were nearly as
wide. A mere 10 minutes earlier, Atlanta had completed a complex
three-way trade with Tampa Bay and Vancouver to make all this
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Standing off to the side during this time was another man, an
investment trader, a long-time Los Angeles Kings season-ticket
holder, a fan of the Long Beach Ice Dogs of the International
Hockey League and a friend of Ice Dogs coach John Van Boxmeer.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Robert Butkus, barely could control his happiness. He
has helped ease Stefan into the American culture by housing the
prospect over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the time I've known him, he's been totally dedicated to
this moment in his life,'' said Butkus. ``To play in the NHL . . .
that was his entire focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Boxmeer had asked his friend to house his newest foreign
player, one with ``only a little plastic bag with him and that was
it,'' said Butkus. ``He had that plastic suitcase, his clothes in
it, and that was it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized he was (17) and if he immersed himself in the
language he would pick it up, and he did. He just learned by
conversation. I spent hundreds of hours with him just talking about
hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   Stefan learned about the trade that made him No. 1 just before
the announcement at the FleetCenter. ``I was so nervous,'' he said.
``It comes true. It was my dream to be No. 1. Atlanta can be a
great team. They will be a great team.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Burke, the Vancouver general manager, had engineered the
three-way deal so the Canucks could obtain the talented Sedin
twins, Daniel and Henrik. Burke talked from midnight to 3 a.m. with
Atlanta and Tampa Bay, slept for three hours, and then began the
talks anew at 6. The deal finally left Atlanta with the top choice,
Vancouver with the next two picks, and Tampa Bay with the fourth,
which the Lightning packaged in another trade with the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Stefan nor Waddell was concerned by the player's two
concussions suffered last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not scared about, you know, going to corner,'' said
Stefan. ``Lots of persons have concussions; they come back. That
are still great players.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he added, ``That's what I be.''

THE SOONERS WERE BETTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two-time All-America tackle Jim Weatherall was the most
dependable of kickers, but a misfire on an extra point on Oct. 7,
1950, against Texas A&AMP;M nearly cost the Oklahoma Sooners much more
than a game.
</P>
<P>
   On the line was a 22-game winning streak, a national
championship and the opening act to becoming the most dominant team
in any sport during the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   After Weatherall's miss, the Sooners kicked off to the Aggies
with a little more than three minutes left and trailing 28-27.
Oklahoma held the visiting Aggies and forced a punt with 1 minute,
46 seconds left. OU quarterback Claude Arnold then led a 69-yard
drive of machine-like efficiency to the end zone for the victory.
Oklahoma coach Bud Wilkinson called the game the greatest comeback
he had ever seen. It was the key victory in OU's first national
football championship season.
</P>
<P>
   The final polls, voting Oklahoma as No. 1, had already been
announced when the Bear Bryant-led Kentucky Wildcats upended the
Sooners in the 1951 Sugar Bowl, 13-7, ending the Sooners' 31-game
winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   That streak paled in comparison to a 47-game mark the Sooners
racked up from the third game of the 1953 season through the eighth
game of the 1957 season, when Notre Dame upset OU. Oklahoma also
was voted national champion in 1955 and 1956.
</P>
<P>
   OU finished the '50s with a 93-10 record (.902 winning
percentage) and a 58-1 mark against conference opponents. The only
conference loss was to Nebraska, 25-21, on Halloween, 1959.

EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Bruins president and general manager Harry Sinden
stepped onto the NHL Draft 1999 stage Saturday to a
less-than-rousing reception.
</P>
<P>
   Then he quickly turned the jeers to cheers.
</P>
<P>
   It was simple, really. He announced that the team and the
FleetCenter were dedicating the day _ the 20th anniversary of the
draft that made Ray Bourque a Bruin _ to the captain.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque highlights took over the scoreboard screen above the
floor. Bourque scoring. Bourque passing. Bourque checking. Bourque
diving head-first to catch up to and break up a play. Bourque with
Bobby Orr. And Bourque taking the No. 7 shirt off his back and
handing it to Phil Esposito so it might hang in the Garden and then
FleetCenter rafters.
</P>
<P>
   And then Gord Kluzak, the No. 1 overall pick in 1982 and master
of ceremonies, introduced Bourque and he came to the microphone
through a door cut in the black backdrop to the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque addressed the draftees-to-be and their guests. He
recalled his draft being done over the phone, not in front of
thousands of fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a great ride,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Have a passion for the game, he reminded all. And keep that
passion for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never forget the passion,'' he said. ``That's what keeps me
going.''
</P>
<P>
   And going. And going. And going.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love you, Ray,'' shouted one fan.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody loves Raymond.
</P>
<P>
   With that he was gone, to return a couple of hours later to more
cheers to announce the Bruins' first pick of defenseman Nick
Boynton at No. 21.
</P>
<P>
   There remains little doubt Bourque prefers facing a crowded
crease with a stick to facing a crowd with a mike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate that,'' he said in a hallway between appearances on
stage. ``Give me a hockey stick and I'll play as long as you want
me to play and I'll have fun. But give me a mike . . . I'm a guy
who sweats a lot, but I don't have to be moving to sweat with a
mike in my hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourque, just back with his family from Aruba for the occasion,
then took on several subjects:
</P>
<P>
   --On the NHL's deciding to play four-on-four in overtime to
lessen the number of games ending in ties: ``I don't like it. As
far as I'm concerned, I don't like any kind of changes. I wish
they'd wait until I'm out of the game before they make any kind of
changes. Four-on-four might open it up a little more, but if they
want to end games fast, just have a shootout.'' You get the decided
impression Bourque, always the traditionalist, would dislike that
even more.
</P>
<P>
   --On Brett Hull's controversial
was-he-or-was-he-not-illegally-in-the-crease goal that gave the
Dallas Stars the Stanley Cup: ``I thought of Washington, that was
my first thought,'' said Bourque, talking of the Bruins' goal that
was taken away in the playoffs a year ago when Tim Taylor's toe was
in the crease. ``The rule, it's so tough to have something like
that happen. The only reason a goal should be called back is if you
bump the goalie or cause interference. Other than that, it's goal,
goal, goal.'' He likes it that the NHL has ruled that such
man-in-the-crease situations no longer will be subject to video
review.
</P>
<P>
   --On Group 2 free agent goalie Byron Dafoe, whom the Bruins are
working on signing: ``He's the ace for us. He was our MVP for last
year, the Vezina finalist. We definitely have to sign Byron. I
talked to him the other day and it seems like they have gotten off
to a pretty good start. I'm optimistic and I think everyone knows
for us to be the team we want to be and keep going forward, Bysie's
a big part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   --On his personal plans, which continue to be to play out the
final year of his contract next year and then decide whether to
play more: ``It certainly makes things easier when you have fun and
win hockey games and have success. Everything is a lot more upbeat.
For now, I'm going to focus on getting ready for this year and play
this year and hopefully have a great year. And then, at this time
next year, we'll probably be talking about the following year and
what's going to happen with that.''

<P>
   BOSTON _ The Bruins selected Kyle Wanvig of the Kootenay Ice of
the Western Hockey League in the third round of the NHL draft
Saturday at the FleetCenter, and the Wanvig gang whooped it up.
</P>
<P>
   Wanvig, a 6-foot-2-inch, 204-pound right wing, had slipped in
the eyes of the draftniks as last season progressed, so his
selection in an early round likely was a relief.
</P>
<P>
   In the Central Scouting Service's midterm report he was ranked
No. 19 among North Americans and by the final ranking he was No. 57
in the list, which does not include goaltenders or Europeans.
Saturday, he was picked No. 89 overall.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth round, the Bruins took Jaako Harikkala, an
18-year-old defenseman from Finland.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins director of scouting Scott Bradley said the team sees
Wanvig as a ``projected power forward.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He shows you flashes,'' Bradley said. ``We want consistency
and we want him to dedicate himself to becoming a player. If he
does that, we could have a pretty good player who could crack our
lineup some day. He skates real well for a big guy and he has a
good frame already.''
</P>
<P>
   Wanvig was the first to bring up his season of underachieving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a slow season this year and dropped off a bit,'' Wanvig
said. ``I just had a bit of trouble around the net scoring goals.
That's what I was supposed to do and I didn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wanvig had 17 goals and 12 assists in 62 games two years ago in
the WHL, and last season had 10 goals and 12 assists. He had 119
minutes in penalties and doesn't mind mixing it up.
</P>
<P>
   His ice time tailed off as the season went on and that made it a
little hard to evaluate him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd go in to see him some times and he'd get three or four
shifts,'' Bradley said. ``But then they played the Calgary Hitmen
in the playoffs and he was one of their better players. He picked
it up and they played him more minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Excited about being picked by the Bruins, Wanvig figures he'll
spend another year or two in juniors, but is looking forward to his
first professional camp this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to get a feel for it and make a good first
impression,'' he said. ``To have a good rookie camp and maybe stay
for the full camp. I'm just excited about going to camp right now.
Every kid dreams about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Harikkala has been playing in the Finnish Elite league, and the
earliest he would be expected around these parts would be for camp
next summer, according to European scout Sven Svenson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a big, home-staying defenseman,'' Svenson said. ``He's a
good passer and moves the puck well. He's strong, 6-2 and over 200
pounds. We were surprised he was still around. Big defensemen
normally are very popular.''

MCNEELEY EATEN UP BY BUTTERBEAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ The Man With The Hat was perplexed Saturday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, local fight manager Vinny Vecchione was wildly
criticized by the Nevada Athletic Commission for pulling on the
brim of his scully cap and jumping into a Las Vegas ring as Mike
Tyson was beating up Peter McNeeley, causing the Medfield, Mass.,
heavyweight to be disqualified only 89 seconds after the fight
began.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, McNeeley had already been down twice and was
cornered on the ropes, with Tyson boring in on him like an auger.
To Vecchione's eyes, stopping things at that juncture seemed a
perfectly logical act.
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward four years and we find McNeeley again pinned on the
ropes late in the first round of his four-round bout with 311-pound
cult hero Eric ``Butterbean'' Esch Saturday night. McNeeley had not
been down nor was he cut, and although the Bean had scored with a
heavy uppercut and a four-punch flurry as McNeeley fell into the
ropes, the round was only a second from being over and his hands
were up. Yet referee Jay Nady leaped between the fighters and ended
the bout at 2:59 of the first round as McNeeley looked at him as if
he had lost his mind.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear McNeeley was having problems with Butterbean's
power and uppercut, but problems are an occupational hazard in
boxing. So when Nady ended the bout so quickly, both McNeeley and
Vecchione were as stunned and displeased as the commission had been
four years ago on another short night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's difficult to keep track of the time, but you stop
a fight that hasn't had a knockdown with a second to go in the
first round?'' Vecchione said. ``They complained before about what
I did and they let that happen? That's a bitter pill to swallow.''
</P>
<P>
   But swallow it McNeeley (45-5) must, after swallowing two solid
uppercuts that snapped his head back, an unexpected left hook that
stunned him for a moment, and that final flurry behind it that
convinced Nady to make his move.
</P>
<P>
   But Nady's premature decision to bring down the curtain may well
have been preordained after commission officials had warned the
refereee to keep a close eye on McNeeley after his emotional
outburst at Wednesday's press conference, in which he talked about
how his life had fallen apart after the Tyson loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought being a little bit emotional at a press
conference should have an effect on a fight three nights later,''
McNeeley said. ``They told us before the fight there'd be no
standing eight and if you got knocked down it would be his
discretion what happened. He never said he'd stop it quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Although that is what happened, there was no question Butterbean
(45-1-1) was getting the better of McNeeley, his nearly 100-pound
weight advantage and fitness to fight working to his advantage.
McNeeley had not fought since February, while the Bean had been in
the ring three times in the last month. And it looked that way, as
he consistently beat McNeeley to the punch.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after World Boxing Council lightweight champion Stevie
Johnston won a boring but unanimous decision from challenger Aldo
Rios, McNeeley burst into the ring all vim and vigor and, soon
after, Butterbean made a grand entrance, gyrating to ``Sweet Home
Alabama'' after rejecting the version of ``You Sexy Thing'' that
was suggested by the fight's promoters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything went exactly as planned,'' Butterbean said. ``I
went for the knockout and I got exactly what I wanted. I was never
hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, neither was Peter McNeeley.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the main event showed why little guys should get the
big money instead of the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   For 12 rounds, World Boxing Association bantamweight champion
Johnny Tapia and challenger Paulie Ayala went toe to toe, nose to
nose, and fist to fist, pounding and banging and clawing at each
other in a fight that was everything that the Evander
Holyfield-Lennox Lewis bout was not.
</P>
<P>
   If it had been any more of a fight, they would have had to call
the cops out to stop it. In the end, Ayala won a close but
unanimous decison, snapping Tapia's 11-year undefeated streak, as
judges Duane Ford and Fernando Viso scored the bout 116-113 and
judge Guy Jutras had it 115-114.

REVOLUTION BURNED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Revolution were weakened by injury, heat, and
humidity Saturday &UR;  &LR; night. But they gave a strong performance before
falling, 2-0, to the Dallas Burn, their first regulation-time
defeat since May 23.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams played confidently, but carelessly, leading to many
scoring opportunities. The Revolution hit the crossbar once and the
post twice, and the Burn scored in the 37th minute when Jorge
Rodriguez finished a Leonel Alvarez cross.
</P>
<P>
   But what promised to be a high-scoring game soon settled into a
battle of attrition as Dallas retreated into a defensive shell and
the Revolution spent the second half unsuccessfully probing for
openings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dallas is a good team but I don't think they played better
than us,'' said Revolution midfielder Jair. ``Once they got ahead,
it was easier for them because we had to go forward and score. We
had our chances in the first half, but some guys got a little tired
in the second half. We lost and we've got to live with that and get
ready to beat New York at home next Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution have earned 15 points in 15 matches, good enough
for third place in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Torres hit the crossbar in the 14th minute, and Joe-Max
Moore and Giovanni Savarese hit the post in the 24th and 41st
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, who had four goals in his last four games, including one
for the US national team, drilled a free kick past Burn goalkeeper
Matt Jordan off the right post. Jordan inexplicably chased a
back-header to the corner flag midway through the first half,
leaving the goal wide open for Torres, but Torres's shot was
blocked for a corner.
</P>
<P>
   The Burn was under siege, but defensive midfielders Alvarez and
Chad Deering, plus Jason Kreis and Oscar Pareja, kept Dallas poised
in counterattack. After a throw-in, Alvarez played a combination
with Kreis, slipped a tackle, and penetrated to the end line to
cross to Rodriguez for the goal. Kreis hit the post seconds later.
The Revolution regrouped, but Savarese headed off the post and
Moore scuffed a point-blank opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution, which played without starters Richard Goulooze
(Achilles' tendon) and John Harkes (hamstring), nearly lost Jair
after a menacing tackle from behind by Alvarez. They did, however,
lose Dan Calichman with a shin bruise.
</P>
<P>
   Dante Washington strained a right knee ligament and the Burn,
second place in the Western Conference, played the final 15 minutes
with only 10 men.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a disappointing loss,'' Moore said. ``We were in the
right spots but we couldn't finish. We made a couple of mistakes
and all of a sudden they were through. If you give those guys the
opportunity they will capitalize.''

DIMARZO STAYS OUT OF TROUBLE 
</HEADLINE>

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRWINDALE _ A.J. Dimarzo's strategy of running his own race paid
off.
</P>
<P>
   The Saugus resident avoided two ugly crashes to win the NASCAR
Super Late Model race Saturday night before a crowd of 4,101 at
Irwindale Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Dimarzo, running safely in third, watched leader Craig Rayburn
and second-place Ben Walker take each other out of the race and
Dimarzo took the lead and held off Brian Kelley for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is plenty of room to race here,'' Dimarzo said. ``I just
ran my race and stayed out of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   T.K. Karvasek of North Hills won the 25-lap Super Stock feature
race, pulling away from Thousand Oaks' Doug McComb down the
straights. But Karvasek was disqualified, giving the victory to
McComb. In the 25-lap Legends feature race, Art Nevill passed Ben
Asquith with five laps to go for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Rayburn, from Simi Valley, led the Super Late Models with four
laps to go and Santa Clarita's Walker close behind. Rayburn says he
received ``a love tap.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind getting bumped, but I do mind being bumped and
then have him throttled up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, 18, said Rayburn ``got loose.'' Walker said he was
already on the throttle and when Rayburn hit the brakes, he hit
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we were going to have an accident,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley, from Arleta, went from last to challenge Dimarzo for the
lead.
</P>
<P>
   On lap 19, Kelley tapped Scott Davidson into the turn 4 wall.
Top qualifier Greg Voigt went underneath Davidson and Brian Barron
landed on top of Voigt, bringing out a red flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unfortunate that someone tried to do something he
couldn't do,'' Voigt said. His damaged car will probably have to be
replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Police were called in as the drivers nearly came to fisticuffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Mechanix Speed Truck Challenge finished at 11:09 p.m., nine
minutes after the curfew. Troy Green won the race.

 &HT;    Electronic Age Creating ``Vid Kids''
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ American kids spend much more time per year in
front of electronic screens in their homes -- TV, computers and
video games -- than they spend in school, according to a new
national report on children and the media.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that nearly half of all homes with children
aged two to 17 have at least one television, a VCR, video game
equipment and a home computer. Three of every five kids aged 12-17
have a TV in their rooms. In homes with children, subscriptions to
the Internet are nearly as common as subscriptions to newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   As a result researchers found more teenagers could name the
cartoon characters on the popular TV show ``The Simpsons'' than
could identify the Vice-President of the United States, Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although television is still dominant, with the introduction
of new media, young people are now spending an average of four and
a half hours every day sitting in front of a screen of some kind,''
said Jeffrey Stanger, Washington director of the Annenberg Public
Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania. The data is found
in four reports that the center is releasing today at its fourth
annual Conference on Children and Television.
</P>
<P>
   The four and a half hours per day in front on a screen comes to
about 1,642 hours per year. The average American child spends about
1,000 hours per year in school, according to the U.S. Department of
Education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The introduction of new media continues to transform the
environment in American homes with children,'' concludes the report
``Media in the Home,'' based on a national survey of parents and
children. ``Rather than displacing television as the dominant
medium, new technologies have supplemented it, resulting in an
aggregate increase in electronic media penetration and use by
America's use.''
</P>
<P>
   Kids spend about two and a half hours per day watching
television programs and another two hours with video games,
computers or the VCR, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
   Other findings: Home computers are now almost as common as cable
television subscriptions. The number of computer homes with
Internet access has doubled since 1996. Video games are available
in nine out of 10 homes with children -- either on home computers
or video game equipment such as Gameboys or both.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are so profound that, in its fourth year, the
Annenberg Center has renamed one report, ``Media in the Home''
rather than ``Television in the Home.'' This report is based on a
national random television survey in April and May of parents of
children aged two to 17 and a random sample of their 10 to 17 year
old children in homes with televisions. The margin of error was
plus or minus 2.9 percent in the parents survey and plus or minus
5.7 percent for the smaller sampling of kids.
</P>
<P>
   Parents opinions of children's television is at its lowest point
in the four years of the survey. Only 13.6 percent had a positive
view of programming for their children. However, the number of
parents who said they have established rules about TV viewing has
fallen from a high of about 69 percent in 1997 to about 62 percent
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Confirming the influence of television, the study found that
while 93 percent of the 10 to 17 year-olds knew that ``The
Simpsons'' has characters named Homer, Bart and Maggie, only 63
percent could name Al Gore as the vice president. However, the
parents were also more familiar with ``The Simpsons'' -- with 84
percent correctly naming the TV show and 80 percent correctly
naming the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Parents are also increasingly worried about their children's
exposure to the Internet. Although television still tops the list
of biggest media concerns, the Internet has surpassed music lyrics
as the second biggest worry. Two in five parents (19.8 percent)
named the Internet, up from 12.9 percent last year. For the first
time, fewer than half the parents (43.8 percent) were most
concerned about television, compared to 55.6 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   The survey showed that more and more families are going online.
Indeed, in households with annual incomes over $75,000, about 72
percent have Internet connections, compared to 67 percent with
newspaper subscriptions. In all homes with children, 41 percent
have Internet connections and 48.5 percent have newspaper
subscriptions.
</P>
<P>
   In a second study, ``The 1999 State of Children's Television
Report,'' the Annenberg researchers found that the quality of
children's television has begun to improve.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found 1,324 programs for children available in a
week of all cable and broadcast channels in the Philadelphia
television market. That was a 12 percent increase over the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The venue with the most children's programs was the Cartoon
Network with 269 shows aired over one week, followed by PBS
offerings (on four PBS stations) with 265 programs. Nickelodeon
came in third with 187 shows in a week,'' the researchers found.
</P>
<P>
   Basic cable channels air 55 percent of the children's
programming, followed by PBS stations with 20 percent and premium
cable with 11 percent. Only about four percent of the programs for
children aired on the major commercial networks -- ABC, CBS, NBC
and Fox.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that the proportion of children's programs
containing no enriching material at all dropped to 25 percent from
48 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the improvement in children's television may be
attributed to the (Federal Communication Commission's) 'Three Hour
Rule','' said Amy B. Jordan, director of Annenberg's children's
television analysis. The rule requires broadcasters seeking
expedited license renewal to air at least three hours of
educational programming for children each week.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that virtually all commercial broadcast stations
are airing these programs at times when children are awake and in
the audience and that most of the programs do have educational
value. However, only 6 percent of programs for children are aired
during prime time in the evenings.
</P>
<P>
   The Annenberg Public Policy Center is a community of scholars at
the University of Pennsylvania that sponsors research and
conferences addressing public policy issues at the federal, state
and local level. It has several ongoing projects concerning the
media and society.

BEIJING OVERRULES HONG KONG HIGH COURT'S IMMIGRANT RULE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ In a move with profound implications both for the
autonomy of Hong Kong and for hundreds of thousands of divided
families, China's parliament Saturday overturned a controversial
supreme court ruling that would have allowed an estimated 1.6
million children to immigrate here from mainland China.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of would-be migrants demonstrated outside government
offices Saturday to protest the interference by Beijing in Hong
Kong law. Some families have been waiting more than 20 years for
their children to be allowed entry to Hong Kong, blaming red tape,
long waiting lists and sometimes corrupt practices by Chinese
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the human face of the controversy, however, is the
question of Hong Kong's judicial independence from China. Legal
activists, the local bar association and opposition legislators
denounced Saturday's the Chinese parliament's ``interpretation'' of
an earlier ruling by Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal as a dangerous
precedent undermining the promise of ``one country, two systems.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, when China gained control of Hong Kong from Britain,
Beijing vowed that the freewheeling capitalist enclave would retain
autonomy on almost all matters, including legal issues, for at
least 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   The first test of that promise has come with a now two-year
battle over who has the right to live in this prosperous territory.
Hong Kong's constitution, the Basic Law, grants the right to reside
here to all mainland-born children of permanent Hong Kong
residents.
</P>
<P>
   The local government argued in court that illegitimate children
and children born only after their parents acquired permanent
residency, 1.6 million people, according to government estimates,
should not share that right. Government leaders are terrified at
the possibility of a 25 percent jump over the next 13 years in Hong
Kong's population of 6.4 million. The government said the influx
would cost the territory $90 billion and strain schools, hospitals,
the economy, and social order.
</P>
<P>
   But the goverment lost its case in court, and turned to the the
Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress in
Beijing, which has the right to ``interpret'' Hong Kong's Basic
Law. The Standing Commmittee Saturday said Hong Kong's highest
court should have consulted with the committee before issuing its
verdict. The committee also said the court misunderstood the Basic
Law.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong legal advocates said Beijing's critique missed the
point, that Hong Kong judges were promised the right to interpret
local laws themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the beginning of the end of the rule of law in Hong
Kong,'' said an outraged Martin Lee, chairman of the leading
opposition Democratic Party and a prominent lawyer. In any court
case, he added, ``The government is telling the whole world that if
government wins, it's final, but if the government loses, it's not
final, because the government will then go to Beijing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee said Saturday's action dissolved any pretension that Hong
Kong is running its own affairs. ``It's impossible to think there
was no collusion'' between the Hong Kong government and Beijing.
``Of course they're working hand-in-glove.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tung Chee-hwa, a former shipping tycoon whom China
handpicked as Hong Kong's chief executive, defended his request for
a legal interpretation from Beijing as ``entirely legal and
constitutional. We treasure the rule of law as one of the most
important pillars of Hong Kong's success.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary for Justice Elsie Leung told reporters, ``You must
accept that there's a new constitutional order. . . . This is part
of our system: a higher authority overruling a lower authority.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hong Kong was a British colony, Leung said, whenever the
courts ruled against the government, it would lobby the legislature
to amend the law. ``Nobody ever complained that that was an erosion
of judicial independence.'' Since the return to Chinese rule, she
added, ``the local legislature has neither the power to interpret
nor amend the Basic Law.''
</P>
<P>
   Tung, the chief executive, also noted that newspaper surveys
show that a majority of Hong Kong residents support the
government's efforts to stop the feared influx of migrants.
``Everyone wants families to be reunited. We, in making a decision,
have to balance humanitarian concerns with the long-term interests
of our community as a whole,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's ``interpretation'' from Beijing will not affect an
estimated 900 mainland Chinese who have proven their parentage and
who came to Hong Kong after the July 1, 1997, return to Chinese
rule. A a court ruling on Jan. 29 this year granted them the right
to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Another 2,700 people who arrived during that period, but whose
claims have not yet been verified, will have to return to China or
have already returned, and their applications will be processed
``in due time,'' the government said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the estimated 1.6 million people who became eligible to live
here under the January court ruling, only those born out of wedlock
after their parents became permanent residents, roughly 170,000,
will retain that right, government officials said. The government
has never disputed the eligibility of an additional 98,000
mainlanders whose parents were married and had resident status.
</P>
<P>
   But that did not satisfy hundreds of would-be immigrants who
chanted slogans, waved signs, and briefly scuffled with police
outside government offices here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our parents are worried that we may now be deported,'' said
Chen Shui-chung, 22, who has overstayed her visitor's visa since
March 1998. Chen and her sister have been waiting 20 years in
China's Fujian province to join her father, and nine years to join
her mother in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no close relatives in China,'' she said. ``But our
parents cannot follow us back if we are forced to go, because they
have to make money to live, and with the economy as it is in China,
they can only do that here.''

 &HT;    A new beginning in the end of entitlements
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Finally the Rehnquist court has rendered a decision
that will give its conservative majority a place in history. Like
it or not, the U.S. Supreme Court's recent ruling bolstered
federalism to a degree not undertaken since the New Deal era when
the court struck down much of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's
national economic legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Until last week, Chief Justice William Rehnquist and his four
conservative colleagues _ Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas,
Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony Kennedy _ looked as if they might
continue to play with the moral agenda. I have always argued that
constricting individual liberties, as the socially conservative
agenda does, conflicts with traditional conservative principles. At
long last, though, the Rehnquist court spoke to the more important
framework of government instead of the details of moral issues that
have made the conservative majority look as if it were tinkering
instead of shaping democratic principles.
</P>
<P>
   In his opinion, Kennedy said the federal government cannot, in
effect, treat states as provinces or corporations. It must treat
them with the respect due joint participants in a federal system.
The court ruled that state employees cannot sue the state without
its permission in its own courts _ and that Congress cannot totally
abrogate that sovereign principle.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean state workers in Maine had no remedy for the
failure of the state to pay them back wages they should receive
under a federal law. As Kennedy pointed out, the federal agency, in
this case the Labor Department, could have easily sued on behalf of
them in state court.
</P>
<P>
   Congress clearly has the power to declare a federal law binding
and enforceable in state court. Maine surely recognizes that, as do
all of the states. But if Congress can use state courts to make a
state cough up economic damages that lie within the power of a
federal agency to enforce, state sovereignty, the majority said, is
out the window.
</P>
<P>
   Although many will think the immediate outcome for the workers
is unfair, this is not the first time a case brought by people
concerned with their own interests has been used by the high court
to define a greater overarching constitutional principle. That was
also true when William Marbury felt his justice of the peace
commission had been wrongly snatched from him in 1801. The famous
case, Marbury vs. Madison, established the lasting principle that
only the Supreme Court has the right to declare acts of Congress
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy decision leaves unanswered questions: Does it mean
age discrimination laws or the Americans with Disabilities Act, if
allegedly violated by a state, can't be enforced by state employees
in state court?
</P>
<P>
   States' rights are important in our constitutional scheme,
though no one would return to the era when they were code words for
wrong decisions _ such as that in the famous Dred Scott case, in
which Chief Justice Roger Taney declared Congress could not bar
slavery.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy decision was the kind of bold mark a conservative
court should leave in the evolution of democracy. The liberal
Warren court marked the end of state school segregation and
confirmed the legalization of abortion. The Rehnquist court
declares that Congress does not have total power over the states,
however. A hundred years from now, scholars are likely to say the
decision was important to our federal system.

 &HT;    Searching for signs of survival in unforgiving Southwest
territory
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAJITAS, Texas _ My wife is skittish about wildlife along the
roadside, so as we drove we didn't discuss the matter of the
chihuahua herds.
</P>
<P>
   We'd read in the Desert Candle, a free publication picked up in
Alpine, about the ``stealthy, tiny but deadly'' feral chihuahuas of
the Big Bend area.
</P>
<P>
   Don't stop in the desert, it warned, not so much as to irrigate
a yucca, lest they amass: ``beasts capable of encircling any prey
and nibbling them to death from the bottom up.''
</P>
<P>
   Even minivans?
</P>
<P>
   The Candle, a dusty tongue in its cheek, is pulling our legs.
But you could easily imagine dogged ankle-high predators taking
over some of these these parts. No one else would challenge them.
</P>
<P>
   Even the camels gave up.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Civil War, the U.S. military tried patrolling the
border region by camel. The experiment got shelved because of the
war, with the camels left to roam. They'd all died off before the
turn of the century. Not tough enough, apparently.
</P>
<P>
   Other wildlife thrive in Big Bend, mule deer and javelinas in
particular, say the parks people. This should give us new respect
for these creatures. It is merciless territory, depending on which
side of the equinox you're on.
</P>
<P>
   When we drove through Lajitas in the afternoon swelter, the lone
welcome was from a party of one, advertised as ``the world's only
beer-drinking goat.'' We didn't stay to visit him in his
chicken-wire quarters, assuming a goat's breath to be vile enough
on hay alone.
</P>
<P>
   Terlingua, home of the famous world chili cook-off, advertises a
ghost town in its midst. In heat like this _ 98 when I dared to
check _ one is challenged to decide which part of town is haunted
and which is just vacated.
</P>
<P>
   Think of those camel mounties. Though they had time to admire
the jagged croppings and auburn hues of Big Bend, one imagines a
whole lot of them in searing August wondering why in Hades we were
trying to hang onto this chunk of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   A hundred miles or so northeast are the ruins of abandoned Fort
McKavett. Now a state park with some of the quarters restored, it
sits as a stony sentinel above the San Saba valley, still waiting
for action.
</P>
<P>
   Its mission was to defend against Comanches and Apaches. When
the Civil War heated up, however, the fort was no more necessary
than a dromedary squadron. The troops were pulled _ those who
hadn't bolted into the desert already.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Parks and Wildlife literature cites ``isolation that
compelled bored soldiers to desert or recklessly spend their wages
in the bawdy houses of nearby Scabtown.''
</P>
<P>
   You've got something short of four-star accommodations when a
place called Scabtown makes your mouth water.
</P>
<P>
   The last detachments at Fort McKavett, after the war, were
federal Buffalo Soldiers, black troops suited for the task no doubt
by having seen indignities worse than this.
</P>
<P>
   Like any frontier, there is beauty out here, and there is misery
for the poorly suited, like the parched traveler whose freon is low
and who just wants a pallet and a Slurpee.
</P>
<P>
   A group called the Texas Camel Corps, based in Valley Mills,
will be recreating the 19th-century expeditions in Big Bend Ranch
State Park in July and August. You can call (915) 229-3416 to
reserve a hump.
</P>
<P>
   I will pass. I think about those camels of yore. What became of
their numbers? A hint may come from one of their points of origin
into Big Bend, from the expedition that led them through a place
called Dog Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Theory: They tried to retrace their steps back to blessed
Arabia. Whereupon the chihuahuas ate them.

 &HT;    Brandy isn't down on touring anymore
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Brandy came into the music business just wanting to be
down.
</P>
<P>
   If her 1994 self-titled debut sold a million copies, ``That
would be awesome!'' she exclaimed then, in typical 15-year-old
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   If some awards came along with it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I would just die!''
</P>
<P>
   And if by chance the McComb, Miss., native happened to meet her
idol Whitney Houston _ ``Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! I would
be in another world!''
</P>
<P>
   But, as the chorus of her first single insists, she basically
just wanted to be ``down'' with you, the listener.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want people to just hear me,'' Brandy said earnestly in
November 1994, minutes after performing at Atlanta's Crim High
School. ``And then maybe, hopefully, like me.''
</P>
<P>
   A simple request _ to which audiences responded by buying 4
million copies of ``Brandy.'' ``I Wanna Be Down'' was the first of
what would be six consecutive Top 10 pop singles.
</P>
<P>
   And she didn't just get to meet Houston; they co-starred
together in a TV version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's
``Cinderella,'' ABC's most-watched movie in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she was the teen star that started all of the interest
in teen stars now,'' says Gary Glenn of the Atlanta quintet Silk,
which is touring with Brandy and is managed by her mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``She made people take us seriously,'' adds Atlanta teen
vocalist Monica.
</P>
<P>
   And now, at 20, throaty, Grammy Award-winning Brandy has decided
to return to the concert stage. In the meantime, she has become as
big a star on television (``Moesha'') and movie screens (``I Still
Know What You Did Last Summer'') as in music. Not so long ago she
vowed never to set foot on the concert stage again, reeling from
crowd reaction during her tour with Boyz II Men.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before beginning her first headlining tour, she agreed
to answer some questions.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What happened?
</P>
<P>
   A: I really don't know. When I was on tour with Boyz II Men, I
had just come out. And it wasn't like I was comfortable with the
fans. Because it wasn't like they'd really come to see me. It's not
like this tour. My tour. You know, I hate saying I headline the
tour, because I don't want to make people feel like I did. So let's
just say I go on last. I have the most people onstage.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's this about there being seven costume changes in your
show? Picking up a few tips from Diana Ross?
</P>
<P>
   A: (Laughs.) That was my dad's idea. But I was like, ``I don't
think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've said you want to be a combination of Janet Jackson and
Whitney Houston on tour. How do you plan to do that?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh, believe me, I know vocally and physically that's hard to
do. Singing and dancing and singing on key, without running out of
breath? Oh, my God! It's taking some training.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've given up the McDonald's fries?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm trying to give up McDonald's fries. Overall, I'm just
trying to stay healthy and work out a lot. Drinking a lot of water.
I've lost 20 pounds doing Tae Bo.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was it like to be a part of ``VH1: Divas Live 2'' with
Whitney Houston and Cher? Did you feel like you belonged?
</P>
<P>
   A: I was scared to perform there, too. The thing that really
tripped me out was being onstage with Tina Turner. She is Janet and
Whitney onstage. Before the show, though, I was hearing people say
I was too young to be considered a ``diva.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think so?
</P>
<P>
   A: It didn't matter to me. Evidently VH1 thought I was supposed
to be there.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Have you passed any advice to other young stars, like Britney
Spears?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've met Britney a couple of times. And basically I told her
to make the money. Don't let the money make you. And don't worry
about the rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does the media get wrong about you?
</P>
<P>
   A: The media wants to portray me as a little girl, and I'm not.
I'm smarter than what people think. But people always want to ask
me silly questions, like about my bellybutton. ``Why can't you show
your navel?'' Or it's, ``So I heard you got a tattoo.'' That's not
interesting to me. It's never, ``Brandy, what do you read?'' or
``Why do you think Lauryn Hill is so deep?'' (It's) ``Did I really
have a fight with Monica backstage?'' That's not interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And not true either, right?
</P>
<P>
   A: Absolutely not.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So what are you reading these days?
</P>
<P>
   A: A book called ``A Course in Miracles.'' Basically it's saying
nothing real is threatening and nothing unreal exists. Herein lies
the peace of God.

 &HT;    The Generation `Buy'
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Strolling at nearly a jogger's pace down the corridors
of Perimeter Mall, Cade Grisham busts a Larry with his friend Chris
Barry, heading to the shirt racks in Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, an
upscale shop whose ear-splitting music, bright lights and young
sales staff attracts teen-agers like bugs to candles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cool,'' says Cade as the two plop down on a plump couch to
plot strategy. ``Yeah, but expensive,'' Chris responds, as other
chattering teens wander in and out, gently touching garments and
placing them back respectfully on neat stacks.
</P>
<P>
   Cade and Chris are 16-year-olds. They're among the core of
what's known as Generation Y, the offspring of baby boomers. These
are kids who wouldn't be caught dead in the tattered, tacky,
tie-dyed garb their nonconformist parents wore as marks of
rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Rebellion doesn't really fit Gen Y. Coming of age during the
prosperous, peaceful '90s, it's the richest, savviest, most
optimistic generation ever, marketers who study the kids say. And
the biggest-spending one, too. The teen-age Gen Y'er already spends
nearly $84 a week.
</P>
<P>
   Good-bye Gen X slackers, hello Gen Am-Ex.
</P>
<P>
   That spending, combined with Gen Y's sheer size _ there are 31
million American teens now, and the number will continue to grow
until 2010 _ means they're capable of creating and killing trends
almost overnight, says Michael Wood, director of research for
Chicago's Teenage Research Unlimited, one of the many think tanks
that have popped up like pimples to help retailers rake in their
share from teens' deep pockets.
</P>
<P>
   That's why it's critical for stores such as Abercrombie to
``have a cool feel,'' Wood says. Stores turn up the music and stay
attuned to the fickle, flexible minds of kids who can turn a hot
item cold almost overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Take baggy jeans. A year ago they were so hot retailers couldn't
get them fast enough. Now many stores are stuck with jeans that
won't even sell on sale.
</P>
<P>
   Even Nike, the once-dominant sneaker brand, is now barely ahead
of once-forgotten Adidas in teen popularity.
</P>
<P>
   And beware, managers at the Gap: ``I think Gap stuff has fizzled
out,'' says Anita Kim, an 18-year-old Emory University freshman,
fingering a rainbow of pastel shirts at Gadzooks, a chain growing
in popularity. ``Gadzooks is more trendy. More cool. Cheaper.''
</P>
<P>
   To grab hold and increase their share of this ever-changing
market, businesses have to hop to be hip, to shift their focus from
aging baby boomers, says economist Charlie Carter of Clark Atlanta
University.
</P>
<P>
   They need to employ people who speak the lingo, knowing, for
example, that to ``bust a Larry'' means hang a left, that to
``hang'' means to relax, and that ``sup'' can mean anything from
``what's new'' to ``what are you doing tonight,'' says Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generation Y's parents dominated culture for several
decades,'' Wood says. ``Gen Y will dominate the next few decades,
so it's critical that we know more about them, what they think,
what they want to do and where they want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   In broad terms, Gen Y is more entrepreneurial and upbeat about
the future than their predecessors, the more cynical and less
numerous Generation X'ers. And definitely into shopping. Teenage
Research Unlimited says the average teen visits a mall 54 times a
year, compared to 39 for other shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, teens are somewhat thoughtful shoppers. They don't
generally spend on a whim but save money for CDs, videos and
movies, says Irma Zandl of the New York-based Zandl Group. As
shoppers, they have a powerful tool previous generations didn't _
the Internet. Most Gen Y'ers at least have access to the Web, using
it to browse and buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're price conscious,'' says Laura Hay, 18, a high school
grad who's headed to the Pratt Art Institute in Brooklyn, N.Y.
``Most kids our age work.''
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Alaina Johns, 14, browsing in American Eagle, says,
``Whenever I need something, I get it. But I also baby-sit and
save.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Keller, a 14-year-old freshman in suburban Atlanta,
insists she's a frugal shopper.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get CDs cheaper at other places than the mall,'' she
says. ``I'd never buy them here.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds friend Amanda Feldman, 14, also a freshman: ``I baby-sit
and save. If I want something and it's expensive, my parents will
split the cost. But I don't get stuff just because I want it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lots of kids who look like they're shopping, might not be. TRU
found in a recent poll that 87 percent of Gen Y'ers go to malls to
shop, but 73 percent also go just to hang out.
</P>
<P>
   Between yelps of ``yes'' and ``awwright'' as he furiously pushes
buttons on a video game at Perimeter's Tilt arcade, Chris Williams,
13, says he mainly goes to malls to be with friends.
</P>
<P>
   But he has also managed to aquire the right clothes. He looks
like a model for a Hilfiger ad. He's also into the FUBU and Zonz
brands. ``I have enough money to keep me happy,'' he grins.
</P>
<P>
   Where does the money come from? A lot comes from parents.
</P>
<P>
   The booming economy has filled the pockets of boomers, many of
whom are easy marks when their kids open their palms, says Dr.
Michael Popkin, an Atlanta child psychologist. He urges parents to
avoid giving in too easily.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not solely boomer affluence that's responsible for the
Gen Y spending spree. Guilt is another factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time poverty,'' says economist Jeffrey Humphreys of the
University of Georgia. ``Parents have money, and in more than 50
percent of marriages both partners work.
</P>
<P>
   ``And parents who're divorced or single try to offset guilt by
giving money when asked.''
</P>
<P>
   Page Morgan, 42, feels she's spoiling her two sons, ``but I
absolutely can't help it.''

   Both she and her husband work and are too exhausted to devote as
much time to their kids as they'd like.

   ``The reason I work as hard as I do is so I can give my children
more,'' says Morgan, a real-estate agent. But, she says, ``I worry
we're not teaching them how to appreciate a dollar.''

   Gen Y'ers money also comes from the ambitious teens' jobs.
According to Teenage Research Unlimited, 55 percent of Gen Y'ers
get at least some of their money from their parents on an as-needed
basis, 47 percent get it from odd jobs, 44 percent get it from
gifts, 30 percent get it from part-time jobs, 28 percent get it
from allowances and 12 percent get it from full-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if the economy turns sour, some of those sources will
start to run dry. Which is sure throw the Gen Y shopping culture
for a loop.
</P>

   ``There may be a rude awakening,'' says Carter. ``The savings
rate is lower than it's been since the Depression. Personal debt is
at an all-time high, and so is credit card debt and bankruptcies.
They can only keep spending as long as good times roll.''

RECLAIMING LIFE: BURN VICTIM, FAMILY CELEBRATE PROGRESS DESPITE

<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTER, Texas _ Three hundred sixty-five days ago, Robert
Middleton had a birthday, his eighth, and he got a most
extraordinary gift: his life.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Robert will be 9, but no present will rival what he
already has been given.
</P>
<P>
   Such thinking might seem outlandish for a boy whose world is
defined by burn dressings, compression wraps, daily physical
therapy and bimonthly surgery. Robert is, after all, a boy for whom
ordinary childhood is now long ago and far away.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a facsimile of boyhood is still his to enjoy. Just now he's
sitting up, carefully, in the office of his uncle's glass shop,
playing a computer game for the first time. His wheelchair is
parked nearby.
</P>
<P>
   He's maneuvering the computer mouse and following the screen
action with his right eye. He murmurs excitedly to his aunt,
hovering at his shoulder, as he scores points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't ever done this before,'' he tells a visitor. ``I
like it better than video games, but it's harder.''
</P>
<P>
   His words, some syllables garbled because of his missing lower
lip, are testimony to his boyish priorities. His bright voice
delivers the smile that his scarred face cannot. Enough said, he
turns eagerly back to the screen.
</P>
<P>
   On June 28, 1998, Robert Middleton stumbled, aflame from head to
foot, from the pine woods near his home near Houston.
</P>
<P>
   What first looked to be a devastating accident was revealed to
be far more sinister when, as he lay awaiting emergency evacuation,
he told his mother that he had been set on fire by a neighborhood
boy.
</P>
<P>
   The motive remains uncertain, but questions about what happened
on that forest pathway quickly became secondary to saving Robert's
life.
</P>
<P>
   Burned over virtually his entire body down to the third layer of
his skin, doctors said &UR;  &LR; Robert faced only the most remote chance of
survival when he arrived at Shriners Burns Hospital-Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that he was alive at all was cause for hope.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, he was undergoing the first of what became a
procession of skin grafts. Within days he was beginning to
stabilize and endured torturous daily bathings, skin debridement
and dressing changes.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks he was recovering from surgical grafts of cultured
skin _ tissue grown from his own skin, using state-of-the-art
technology _ and showing promise for an altogether miraculous
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Through all of those numbing days and nights, Bobby Ray and
Colleen Middleton stood by the youngest of their three children.
Robert's initial hospital stay was seven months. For seven months,
his parents held their breath.
</P>
<P>
   His mother's great ambition once had been to finish the makeover
that she and her husband were giving their Splendora-area home, a
bungalow that the Middletons occupied on a rent-to-own basis.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to caring for an adventurous 8-year-old; a
12-year-old son, Clint; and a daughter, Heather, 14; Colleen
Middleton, 34, worked in the Porter glass shop run by Mark Wise,
her brother. Bobby Ray, 36, worked there also. After eight years,
the Middletons had done enough work on the house to see the end in
sight.
</P>
<P>
   All that changed on June 28.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Robert was hurt and expenses began to mushroom,
the Middletons had to vacate their home. They now live at an
undisclosed location elsewhere in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd spent a lot of money and time on that house,'' Colleen
says nostalgically. ``We wanted to stay there the rest of our
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, literally, the Middletons became around-the-clock
nurse trainees at the Galveston hospital where Robert struggled to
recover. For three months after his hospital admission, the couple
stayed in an apartment provided by the Shriners.
</P>
<P>
   They spent hour after hour at Robert's side _ in his room, in
physical therapy, outside the operating room or in the debridement
facility _ learning how to tend to his wounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was scary, especially the debridement,'' his mother
remembers. ``You remove the compression bandages, then the gauze,
then the dressings. Then you wash the skin very gently. Then you
use tweezers to peel away dead tissue. It's like the thinnest
tissue paper. One wrong move and it can all peel away, just like
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert was very brave. He'd only cry when it hurt really
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The Middletons knew a day both joyous and fearful lay ahead: the
day Robert would leave the hospital _ if not permanently, then at
least for weeks and eventually months at a time.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's father had to return to work after 90 days in
Galveston, but he made the trip to the hospital every weekend.
Robert's mother stayed on for an additional four months.
</P>
<P>
   When he drove Robert home for the first time Jan. 9, Bobby Ray
Middleton had much to think about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always on my mind that a lot of work and responsibility
was facing us,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He could not avoid recalling happier times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert was always good with his hands. He was always taking
scraps of wood and trying to build something. Once he built me a
toolbox. Another time he decided to smash a golf ball with a
hammer. The hammer flew back and hit him in the head.''
</P>
<P>
   The father chuckles softly at the memory. A few feet away,
though appearing to focus on the computer game, Robert is
eavesdropping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't ever do that again,'' he chirps, tilting his head for
a sly glance at his dad.
</P>
<P>
   Robert was made comfortable in his new home, but recollections
of his old home and what had occurred there would intrude. Says his
mom, ``He'd mention wanting to go back, and he'd bring up what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The scenario alleged by authorities for that grim summer
afternoon has been widely reported:
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say Robert was attacked by a former neighborhood
friend, Don Collins, 13, who doused him with gasoline and set him
afire. The teen allegedly was angry that Robert had accused him of
stealing his fireworks, but investigators admit they still aren't
sure about a motive.
</P>
<P>
   Robert's mother says her son identified Collins as his assailant
in those heart-crushing moments before emergency personnel arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talks about it every so often _ I try not to bring it up _
and he asks mostly why it happened,'' she says. ``I tell him that
some people are just mean. I don't know how to answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins was taken into custody soon after the attack and
remained in juvenile detention until January, when he was released
to an uncle with whom he has stayed since.
</P>
<P>
   Like Robert, Collins is being home-schooled to keep him up to
speed with his schoolmates, says Bill Hall, his lawyer. Hall will
say little beyond that, other than to note that his client is glad
to be out of detention.
</P>
<P>
   Hall says the teen denies harming Robert or having even been
present at the scene of the torching.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery County prosecutor Bill Patillo says he expects to
take his evidence to a grand jury next month. Since the case
involves a juvenile, Patillo will file what is called a petition
with the grand jury, and the jurors will decide what charges, if
any, are warranted.
</P>
<P>
   Patillo has spoken with Robert several times. He says Robert's
account of that day remains ``materially'' unchanged from what he
provided a year ago. He expects him to testify if a trial takes
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very forthright about events of that day,'' says Patillo.
</P>
<P>
   For now, for the Middletons, trial proceedings are somewhere
over the horizon. Their journey is strictly day by day, step by
step.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent milestone for Robert has been just that: steps.
With the aid of a walker, he now can take short, stiff-legged
steps, no longer a prisoner of his wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day, while I was out of the room, he got himself out
of his wheelchair and made it over to the sofa,'' says his mother.
``That was a huge achievement'' _ the very sort that his daily two
hours of physical therapy are designed to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   On July 7, the Middletons will make another trip to Shriners in
Galveston for another surgery. This one will ``release''
scar-constricted tissue around Robert's neck, chin and mouth in
hope of restoring his lower lip.
</P>
<P>
   Surgeons also will open his burn-blinded left eye, now
half-covered by facial tissue draped across the socket for
temporary protection. A corneal transplant, like the one he has had
on his right eye, is being contemplated.
</P>
<P>
   Family members say they hope these refining operations will
prepare Robert to re-enter school as a third-grader this fall.
Robert says he's eager to return. He already has been visited by
some of his friends from school. The Shriners hospital will provide
special counseling for Robert and his classmates.
</P>
<P>
   As Robert's recovery proceeds, expenses mount, of course. The
Shriners already have provided, for free, about $1 million in
surgery, therapy and other support, hospital officials estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Much more will be required.
</P>
<P>
   The Middletons and their relatives have incurred at least
$100,000 in nonhospital costs for everything from bandages to the
minivan they had to buy to transport Robert.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Wise and his wife, Kendra, say the trust fund established
to handle donations to help Robert has covered almost all of those
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, everything's being taken care of and will be for
the next several years,'' says Mark Wise.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the picture isn't clear.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Robert will face new rounds of surgery to release
stiffened elbows, knees and shoulders, to attach prosthetic ears
and, as he matures, to periodically remove and replace skin grafts
he has outgrown.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way will be countless hours of debridement and
rebandaging and therapy _ and prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a religious man, and I'm thankful for everyone's prayers
for our son,'' says Bobby Ray Middleton. ``I feel like God has
answered our prayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors who are around Robert even briefly shouldn't be
surprised to find themselves wondering deeply about the meaning of
life. He's still a little boy and can't help them much in their
reflections, except by example.
</P>
<P>
   And that may be enough. His existence is his message: Life is
precious.
</P>
<P>
   Ask him what he thinks his future holds and he'll reply, simply
and happily, ``I'm going to live _ live for the rest of my life!''

PEACE EFFORT IN IRELAND COMES DOWN TO A FEW WORDS: DISARM BY 2000  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Great Britain)   By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ David Trimble, the first minister of the
Northern Ireland Assembly, said Sunday that the stalled peace
effort in Ulster could be saved by a simple statement from Sinn
Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, that the IRA
is committed to disarming by May 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview Sunday morning, Trimble, the leader of
the Protestant Ulster Unionist Party, did not mention the position
he has voiced repeatedly that the IRA must start actual disarmament
before Sinn Fein will be allowed to take ministerial posts in the
Assembly. ``No guns, no government,'' he has said.
</P>
<P>
   Some politicians and analysts said this was a sign that Trimble
was getting ready to compromise. In oblique reply, Sinn Fein's
chief negotiator, Martin McGuinness, said on Irish national radio
that his party would continue to try to persuade the IRA to agree
to disarm by May 2000, the deadline set in the 1998 peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The disarmament issue has stymied the peace effort for more than
a year. The leaders of the Protestant majority and the Roman
Catholic minority and the prime ministers of Britain and Ireland
are to meet in Belfast on Monday, facing a Wednesday deadline for
compromise on the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain set the deadline for a
settlement and the creation of a Cabinet, including two Sinn Fein
ministers, that will be authorized to accept a transfer of power
from the British government, under the terms of the 1998 agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The transfer of power would then coincide with the establishment
of new powers for two other British provinces, Wales and Scotland.
Blair has said the Wednesday deadline is absolute, but he has not
said what he would do if negotiations collapsed this week. If the
talks do fail, it could provoke sectarian tensions, and violence,
in the Protestant Orange Order parade season, which accelerates in
July.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see the leaders of the Republican movement across
the table tell the rest of us that they accept that they have an
obligation to decommission all paramilitary weapons by May 2000,''
Trimble said, referring to meetings in Belfast in the coming days.
``No ifs. No buts. No excuses. That is what is necessary to save
this agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   McGuinness, asked if he could persuade the IRA to change its
position that it has no plans to disarm, said he would use
``whatever influence I have.'' Sinn Fein says it is independent of
the IRA, a position virtually no one in Northern Ireland or the
Irish Republic believes. The IRA has observed a cease-fire for 23
months.
</P>
<P>
   David McKittrick, the author of several books on Northern
Ireland, said that the words of McGuinness and Trimble, provided
``a new little ray of hope,'' for a compromise by Wednesday.
``Fingers are very firmly crossed, and toes as well,'' he said.
``There are sources of optimism.'' He added, referring to the
cabinet, ``They both want the executive.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Arthur, a professor of politics at Ulster University in
Belfast, said: ``The stakes are incredibly high. It might collapse.
If it does, the leadership of David Trimble will be threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the Sinn Fein leadership of Gerry Adams, the party
president, and McGuinness would also be challenged by those in the
IRA splinter groups, ``the dissidents of the Continuity IRA and the
Real IRA, who want to return to violence _ who simply say, `We told
you so.'''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Trimble is being urged not to compromise by many
hard-line Protestant politicians, including some in is own party,
and the Rev. Ian Paisley, the fundamentalist preacher who leads the
Democratic Unionist Party.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 peace agreement, he recalled, was approved in a
referendum by about 70 percent of the province's population. But
the Protestant population was almost evenly divided.
</P>
<P>
   Monica McWilliams, an Assembly member representing the Northern
Ireland Women's Coalition, said that she would trust a compromise
in which the IRA promised to disarm, not necessarily by
surrendering arms, but by destroying weapons from its arsenal,
estimated at 100 tons.
</P>
<P>
   Methods for disarming, and a timetable for it, are expected to
be proposed on Monday by the International Commission on
Decommissioning, headed by a former Canadian general, John de
Chastelain.
</P>
<P>
   Seamus Mallon, the deputy first minister of the Assembly and a
leader of the mainstream Catholic Social Democratic Labor Party,
said: ``I still believe we're going to get there. But there is no
rabbit going to be pulled out of anybody's hat.'' The two sides
have to compromise their ``very rigid positions,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Then Mallon, a moderate but firm nationalist, turned to a
character from Dickens' ``David Copperfield'' to illustrate the
position he shuns. ``We don't want to be like Micawber,'' he said.
``Somehow or other, something will turn up.''

   FRIDAY HARBOR, Wash. _ If you think about it from the whales'
point of view, said Fred West, ``Mostly what they get from us is a
lot of engine noise. And that's certainly not the best human beings
have to offer.''
</P>
<P>
   So West and the group he directs, Seattle's City Cantabile
Choir, took to the waters around Washington's San Juan Islands to
rectify this, at least for one long sun-dappled summer evening in
which the last stretches of northern light lingered until well
after 10. Out at sea, the group gave a concert for the whales.
</P>
<P>
   With unusual official permission from the National Marine
Fisheries Service, an underwater speaker system and an eclectic
repertory that included Monteverdi's Vespers, Afro-Brazilian songs
for the goddess of the sea and ``When the Saints Go Marching In,''
the sounds of the group wafted across _ and under _ the waters of
northern Puget Sound on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The human spirit was willing. ``We're a lot more loose here than
in a concert hall,'' explained Brad Hawkins, the cellist. ``None of
them,'' he added, referring to the whales, ``are critics.''
</P>
<P>
   Let the record show that in the intended audience, there was no
clapping of hands and no standing ovation. But let it also show
that the killer whales, also known as orcas, showed up, nearly
surrounding the boat at times, cutting the surface of the water,
their distinctive black-and-white coloring spectacularly visible.
It is also indisputably true that during a rendition of ``Amazing
Grace,'' two of the whales turned around and headed back toward the
64-foot boat, the Odyssey, from which the choir sang.
</P>
<P>
   Humans may even be able to figure out one day precisely what the
whales thought of it all. Underwater monitors picked up the
mysterious squeaks, clicks and low whistles the orcas use to
communicate with each other, and a tape recording of the evening
will show just what sounds the whales were making during various
songs.
</P>
<P>
   For whales to surround a boat is nothing unusual here. The
waters off the San Juans and neighboring British Columbia are
considered some of the best whale-watching vantage points on Earth.
All kinds of boats offer whale-watch tours, and here in Friday
Harbor, there's a whale research center, a whale museum and a
22-year-old nonprofit company, Interspecies Communication Inc.,
that among other things works ``to give artists some of the same
access scientists have to wild animals,'' said its founder, Jim
Nollman.
</P>
<P>
   Over near Robson Bight, B.C., an inlet that is perhaps the
busiest whale intersection in the world, a small FM station
actually broadcasts the eerie sounds of the whales, live, 24 hours
a day, seven days a week _ ``all whales, all the time,'' is its
unofficial motto. It is run by the Vancouver Aquarium, which, asked
on the government application it filed two years ago whether the
station would broadcast in English or French, listed ``Whale.''
</P>
<P>
   The whales are so well studied here that naturalists can easily
distinguish them by their markings, and nearly all of the 95 or so
in the three southern ``pods,'' or groups in which the orcas
travel, have names. Among them are Baba, Hugo, Marina, Grace,
Sparky, Squirty, Sissy, Spock, Ruffles, Granny, Tahoma, Oreo,
Sequim, Deadhead, Mike, Leo and Ralph.
</P>
<P>
   No one wanted to make too much of the science Saturday evening.
``This is really more a cultural gesture than some huge Jacques
Cousteau expedition,'' West said.
</P>
<P>
   But even at that, it almost didn't come off, after the choral
group and two other sponsoring environmental organizations, People
for Puget Sound and Friends of the San Juans, made the arguable
mistake of seeking permission to go out to sea and sing.
</P>
<P>
   Some fisheries officials raised the question of whether the
group might be in violation of the Marine Mammal Protection Act.
``The question was, are you seeking to affect the whales'
behavior,'' said Mike Sato, North Sound director for People for
Puget Sound. ``And we had to say, `Well, yeah. We want them to come
and listen.'''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the red tape was cleared up, and so, as the Odyssey
made its way through Haro Strait and the western skies turned
orange and pink over the Canadian peaks nearby, the group sang:
Yeman-ja, the Afro-Brazilian music; ``Plovi, Barko,'' a
Serbo-Croatian song about the sea; a French Christmas carol;
Renaissance madrigals; South African children's songs and the
Christian hymn ``For the Beauty of the Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whales coming at 7 o'clock!'' reported Lynn Danaher, the
skipper of the Odyssey, a former commercial fisherwoman in Alaska,
referring to the orcas' location and not the time. ``Keep Singing!
Keep Singing!''
</P>
<P>
   As two orcas moved slowly along the port side, surfacing now and
then, Ms. Danaher, whose boat runs tours every day from early May
to late September, said she had little doubt the whales were
intrigued. ``But I'm really wondering right now if they want
something a little faster. Like `Johnny B. Goode.'''
</P>
<P>
   Nollman, the founder and director of Interspecies Communication,
who has studied a dozen species of whales around the world and
written several books on them, said the whales themselves were
capable of making phenomenal musical sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ones up north, there are some great sounds for a jazz
musician,'' he said of the orcas that he has studied, for months at
a time, 200 miles to the north off Vancouver Island. ``Some of them
sound like Charlie Parker. They do completely intellectual things.
I've heard stuff up there that would knock your socks off.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he had no doubt the whales heard this concert.
``Their ears are like a bloodhound's nose,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some singers on the boat said the whole experience was a
blissful break from other performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a concert hall, you're trying to make it all perfect,''
said Joanne Nelsen, a singer and composer. ``Here, you're just
trying to reach _ well, somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Fletcher, the executive director of People for Puget
Sound, said the whole point was, for one night anyway, to give the
whales the best human beings have to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice to think it would be well received,'' she
said. ``But whales are whales. If they ignore us, that's OK, too.''
</P>
<P>
   West, meanwhile, said he would simply love to hear something
back from the whales someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole thing out here is, if we could just get off of our
dominion-over-the-earth thing for awhile, put aside the idea that
we're the top of the heap, then maybe we could really learn
something from other species.''

   HOEDSPRUIT, South Africa _ When Elsayed Hussein Akef fled
Mozambique in 1996, abandoning his bankrupt Akef Egyptian Circus
and leaving its lions, tigers, horses, dogs and last sick python to
starve to death, he must not have realized what he had left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the Mozambicans and Britons who saved the animals. It
was only when three of the lions were safe in pens here at the
Hoedspruit Research and Breeding Center for Endangered Species that
someone realized that Giepie, the huge male with the rich black
mane running the length of his underbody, did not look much like
other lions.
</P>
<P>
   Veterinarians now say he is one of the few Barbary lions left in
the world. The last one in the wild was shot in 1921 in Morocco,
and for a few months, there were claims that Giepie was the only
Barbary left. But the excitement over finding him led small
European zoos and circuses to pipe up, ``Hey _ we've got a lion
that looks like that.'' One of them even agreed to ship its lioness
to South Africa, and now the possibility exists that the subspecies
can be bred back into viability.
</P>
<P>
   Barbary lions are the stuff of legend. It was Barbaries,
captured in Rome's north African colonies, that ate Christians in
the Colosseum. Haile Selassie had several in his court when he
ruled Ethiopia. The MGM lion, some assert, was one. But now the
subspecies exists mostly as genetic bits and pieces in other lions,
because many were captured for circuses and interbred.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say the whole idea of a lion ``species'' is rather
tricky. Species are usually separated by ability to mate, but a
lion and a tiger can produce a cub, just as a donkey and a horse
can produce a mule. In Africa, lions are thought of as one species,
but there are several types that seem not to interbreed in the
wild. Barbaries may be one, but they were wiped out of the wild
before they could be studied.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Barbary is based on its look, the big thick mane going from
its belly to its groin,'' said Peter Rogers, the Hoedspruit
center's veterinarian. ``It's sort of like some humans having extra
thick beards.''
</P>
<P>
   How Giepie (pronounced HEE-pee, and renamed after a Hoedspruit
employee with a wild haircut) got here is a roustabout romance in
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1993 and 1996, the Akef circus wandered slowly down
Africa, from Djibouti to Zimbabwe, stopping to put on its
dog-and-pony acts, contortionists and snake charmers for audiences
paying pennies. But it often camped for months without performing,
and conservationists believe it was really a front for smuggling
endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   Six chimpanzees, several pythons and some rare gray parrots were
seized from it, and documents showed that it was buying chimps from
Zairian smugglers. When officials tried to make arrests, Akef
claimed diplomatic immunity and got Egyptian officials to intervene
for him.
</P>
<P>
   In Zimbabwe, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals finally cracked down in late 1995, confiscating three dying
pythons in a raid that ended in a punch-out.
</P>
<P>
   The circus, ordered deported, slipped into Mozambique and camped
in a park in the capital, Maputo. In June 1996, Elena Son, manager
of a tour business, visited and found Akef long gone and his
workers struggling to feed the animals and themselves. One tiger
was dying, and the lions and horses were so thin their ribs stuck
out. The big cats lay in their own excrement in the 3-by-6-foot
cages where they had spent their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Son paid to buy them meat, and brought in Animal Defenders,
a British animal rights group. It found homes in South African game
parks, pushed through the complex paperwork, fended off a
Mozambican nightclub owner trying to seize them for bad debts and
trucked them to Hoedspruit.
</P>
<P>
   Here, released into 28-acre enclosures, the lions were scared
even of rustling leaves. ``They didn't know how to walk in the
bush,'' said Lente Roode, the center's owner. ``They didn't know
how to drink from the pond.''
</P>
<P>
   News of the rescue reached the ears of other zoos. A bankrupt
safari park in Bologna, Italy, offered its two Barbary-looking
lions, Arturo and his sister, Sissi, if the center would pay the
fare. The price, $16,000, broke Mrs. Roode's budget, but she
managed it. Arturo is sterile, but Sissi may be bred with Giepie.
</P>
<P>
   Their meeting has been delayed while they get to know each other
through the fence. Between lions, a failure in sex appeal means a
first date may end in a fatal fight.
</P>
<P>
   There are some Barbaries in an Ethiopian zoo, Mrs. Roode said,
but officials there insisted that she ship her lions to them, ``so
it all fell apart.'' She is talking to a Morocco zoo with some
Atlas lions, which look identical to Barbaries. There is a game
park north of Cape Town that will let any offspring roam free. The
Barbary also resembles the Cape lion, extinct for over 200 years,
so a lion that at least looks right may someday be restored to a
little piece of Africa where it once roamed.

GERMAN FORCES ANNOUNCE CURFEW IN SOUTHERN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By IAN FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRIZREN, Yugoslavia _ German forces here announced Sunday that
they will impose a curfew at night to cut down on lawlessness,
which continues around Kosovo in the form of yet more slayings,
burning of houses and looting.
</P>
<P>
   A man and a woman were shot to death overnight in Dardanija, a
northern suburb of the capital city, Pristina. While officials said
they did not know the motive, another 14 people were reported slain
in Pristina on Friday, many of them Serbs killed in revenge by
ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   In the west, Albanian refugees returning home burned and looted
an entire village, Belo Polje, inhabited until these past few days
by Serbs who are now in flight.
</P>
<P>
   Here in southern Kosovo, the German commander, Brig. Gen. Fritz
von Korff, said Sunday that three Gypsies led his soldiers to a
basement where they claimed they had been tortured by members of
the Kosovo Liberation Army, 130 of whom live in the upper floors of
the house. He said that torture instruments were found there.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a rise in crime here _ just two weeks after the
jubilation that many Albanians felt when NATO forces arrived _ the
general said he would impose a midnight to 5 a.m. curfew. With the
curfew, he said soldiers could better distinguish criminals, who
are stealing cars and looting vacant houses, from ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are running around the town, it will be easier to
catch them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The German base was also visited Sunday by the Czech president,
Vaclev Havel, whose own country, unlike the former Yugoslavia,
moved out of communism a decade ago with virtually no bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all surprised what is possible at the end of the 20th
century in Europe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Havel strongly condemned the acts of revenge carried out by
Kosovo's majority Albanians, saying that they must ``live in peace
with the Serb minority, so that the Serbs have no reason to flee.''
</P>
<P>
   The Germans oversee one of five sectors in Kosovo, divided in
the peace agreement which is aimed at ending the NATO bombing of
Yugoslav forces, and allowing the return of roughly 1 million
Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   But the refugees' return _ weeks or months after they fled or
were kicked out of Kosovo by Serb forces _ has not been smooth:
Many Albanians, whose relatives were killed or who are returning to
destroyed houses, are seeking revenge against Serbs and their
property. In fear, tens of thousand of Serbs have fled Kosovo north
into Serbia proper.
</P>
<P>
   In the western city of Pec and the villages around it, the
houses of Serbs and Gypsies, often allied with the Serbs in Kosovo
against Albanians, have been burning for the last few days. In Belo
Polje, just outside Pec, Albanians with wheelbarrows looted the
houses on Sunday, saying that they were doing to the Serbs what the
Serbs had done to them.
</P>
<P>
   In Pristina, one of the two slaying victims, found dead outside
a post office, was a former employee with the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, which had monitored a
cease-fire in Kosovo last year. The employee was reportedly a
native of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Neither victim was identified Sunday night.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A week after the last of the Serb military forces withdrew from
Kosovo, the next phase in the agreement between NATO and the KLA is
set to take place at midnight on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Already, KLA soldiers are not permitted to carry weapons in the
open or operate checkpoints, two prohibitions that seem largely to
be obeyed. But there are exceptions: on Sunday outside the western
town of Junik, half a dozen soldiers in KLA uniforms armed with
AK-47s were stopping cars to ask where passengers were going.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the KLA is required to have cleared its minefields
and booby traps, and to leave fighting positions and establish
sites for storing weapons, which NATO will be able to inspect.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday on Mount Pastrik, the mountain in southwestern Kosovo
that was a major battlefield in the war, KLA soldiers dragged
wagonloads of ammunition down a steep and rocky road. Nexhat Shala,
one of two soldiers guarding the cache itself _ mortars,
rocket-propelled grenades, land mines and bullets scattered in a
remote clearing _ said the ammunition had been brought over from
Albania in the last week or so.
</P>
<P>
   He said he assumed it would be handed over to NATO, although no
spokesman for the KLA could be reached for confirmation or comment.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Dietmar Jeserich, a spokesman for the German command,
said they were aware of the cache on Mount Pastrik and would make
sure it was properly reported and stored in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know about this,'' he said. ``And we will look at this
place.''

LOWELL MILKEN'S UNUSUAL   INVESTMENT : A LOAN FOR LAWSUIT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The first chapter in this long-running legal soap
opera dates back to 1991 when the fallout from Wall Street's
insider trading scandals sent Michael Milken, the junk bond king,
to federal prison and inspired a best-selling book about carriage
trade criminals, ``Den of Thieves.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael F. Armstrong, a criminal defense lawyer, was mentioned
only briefly in the book, James B. Stewart's account of powerful
Wall Street titans brought down by their own greed in the takeover
frenzy of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   But Armstrong parsed the words and struck back at the author and
the book's publisher, Simon &AMP; Schuster, with a $35 million libel
suit over one paragraph, a legal dispute that the publisher, Simon
&AMP; Schuster, scoffed was a ``frivolous'' waste of time.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years later the lawsuit endures, largely funded, as it
turns out, by a quiet legal patron who said he did not want to
expend the ``negative energy'' to sue: Lowell Milken, the brother
of Milken and Armstrong's former client.
</P>
<P>
   Newly filed court documents indicate that Lowell Milken and his
wife set up a general partnership, Skyline Partners, to lend
Armstrong and his law firm up to $1.6 million for legal expenses,
which need not be repaid fully if the lawsuit fails or a damage
award is too paltry to cover costs. Lowell Milken was indicted in
1989 on securities violations, but the charges were later dismissed
as part of a deal with Michael Milken to plead guilty to six
felonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just simply did not want to devote the time to be involved
day to day in connection with a lawsuit,'' Milken said in
depositions, explaining why he had chosen to become a lawsuit
patron instead of suing himself in connection with the book by
Stewart. ``And I also felt that it was going to involve a lot of
negative energy and I really didn't want to do that at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   This month, lawyers for Simon &AMP; Schuster, which is a unit of
Viacom Inc., filed a motion for a summary judgment in state Supreme
Court in Manhattan, seeking a court decision on the merits of the
case, which a company spokesman, Adam Rothberg, now characterizes
as a ``legal extravagance that has gone on for seven years too
long.'' But the costly and time-consuming legal wrangling over the
book has become a cautionary tale in the book industry, where
publishers have generally been able to prevail ultimately in court
against libel claims.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for instance, St. Martin's Press, won a jury verdict
in a libel dispute following a 10-day New Hampshire trial that
pitted the New York publishing house, which is owned by Holtzbrinck
GmbH, against Robert F. Gray, a prominent Washington public
relations executive and former Eisenhower administration official
whose suit centered on four descriptions of him in a book by Susan
Trento called ``The Power House.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, book publishers are much less likely to be sued for
libel than newspaper publishers or television broadcasters,
according to the Libel Defense Resource Center in New York, a
clearinghouse for information about libel and privacy claims. In
the last 19 years, just 11 libel suits over books have actually
reached trial, with verdicts split about evenly between the
publishers and plaintiffs, Sandra Baron, the executive director of
the libel center, said.
</P>
<P>
   But victory or not, cases like the long-running ``Den of
Thieves'' lawsuit cast a certain pall over the publication of other
critical investigative books because of the potential costs of
dealing with libel lawsuits that could destroy a book's
profitability.
</P>
<P>
   In the battle involving Simon &AMP; Schuster, both sides have spent
more than a $1 million in a lawsuit that has come down to the
meticulous examination of a few hundred words.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, 66, is a well-known criminal defense attorney who was
a member of the judicial selection committee that advised the
former Republican New York senator, Alfonse D'Amato, on judicial
appointments. He said that he no longer was Lowell Milken's
attorney, but that Milken remained a friend who offered to pay
legal fees because he considers the lawsuit a good investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that I'm some sort of stalking-horse for him is not
correct,'' Armstrong said. ``I would have sued whether he did or
not. I told him that whatever happened, I would sue because my wife
said to me that she didn't want the grandchildren taking the book
off a shelf somewhere in a business school and not knowing I went
all the way to fight it.''
</P>
<P>
   The legal sparring began shortly after the book was published in
September 1991. Armstrong, then representing Milken, confronted
Simon &AMP; Schuster executives on his client's behalf with a list of
concerns about the book.
</P>
<P>
   The book essentially consisted of two parts, an account of an
intricate scheme of illegal insider trading crafted by Wall Street
figures that included the arbitrageur Ivan Boesky and Michael
Milken, the driven investment banker who headed the high-yield junk
bond department at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. The second part was
the government search to track down violators.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Milken, who eventually pleaded guilty to six felonies
and went to prison, was described in a much harsher light than
Lowell Milken, a lawyer who is depicted as a cold hatchet man who
assisted his brother on tax and partnership issues.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Lowell Milken who challenged the accuracy of the
book, taking issue with 19 elements ranging from descriptions of
expensive art hanging in his office to an incident when he emerged
from his office to see his brother in a faint at his trading desk
before wordlessly returning to his own office and closing the door
behind him.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Armstrong, had two complaints, which eventually
became the core of his libel suit. In the lawsuit, which was filed
in September 1992, he argued that a paragraph in the book wrongly
suggested that he prepared a false affidavit for a witness to sign
that exonerated Lowell Milken on charges of violating security
laws.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The passage concerns an affidavit that Armstrong was preparing
with information from an in-house lawyer, Craig Cogut, who worked
on partnership issues for Lowell Milken. The intent of the
affidavit was to support Milken, who was under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The critical part of the paragraph about Armstrong starts with a
description of Armstrong submitting an affidavit to Cogut for his
signature. It goes on: ``Cogut read it over and had only one
problem: the facts weren't true. He angrily refused to sign, and
began looking for new lawyers, eventually hiring Los Angeles
lawyers Tom Pollack and Ted Miller.''
</P>
<P>
   The paragraph does not explicitly state who was the source of
the account. Nor does it include a response from Armstrong reacting
to that version. The book's list of sources note that in disputed
descriptions, Stewart accepted the speaker's version in those
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's argument is that the total passage makes it appear
that ``I prepared a bunch of lies, gave it to my client and he
didn't sign it.'' In court documents and further comments, he
points out that the affidavit presented to Cogut was a draft that
he believed to be true at the time, but subject to further
corrections.
</P>
<P>
   Simon &AMP; Schuster argues that there were a number of sources for
the passage: Cogut, his wife and other unidentified people. In
depositions, Cogut said that `` Armstrong had pressured me to
significant degrees to say things beyond what I was comfortable
saying'' and that Cogut was ``furious'' over those events. After
hiring a new lawyer to represent him, Cogut eventually signed a new
version of the affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong contends that Stewart and his researcher never
bothered to check with him about the passage, although the author
in turn contends that he did leave messages for him to call. Since
he sued, Armstrong said he has received support from others who
told him, ``By God, I'm glad somebody did this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is that Stewart is an extreme example of the kind of
thing that goes on a lot,'' Armstrong said. ``People write
inaccurate books with no real recourse on the part of the people
whom they target. They're not going to write books in response.''
</P>
<P>
   The author of ``Den of Thieves,'' Stewart, is at work on another
book that is expected to be published in the fall, ``Blind Eye: How
the Medical Establishment Let a Doctor Get Away With Murder.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said that the libel lawsuit had taken a toll whether he
wins or loses. The book, Stewart said, ``simply told the truth
about some enormously wealthy and powerful people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I remain a defendant in a multimillion dollar lawsuit that
from the beginning has felt like an attempt to harass and punish
me,'' he said. ``It is unpleasant, time-consuming and distracting.
Its existence has clouded my credit rating and made it difficult
for me to get a mortgage. I am sure it has intimidated other
journalists and publishers.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowell Milken, who now presides over the Milken Family
Foundation in Santa Monica, Calif., did not respond to calls for
comment. But in depositions that he gave for the libel case, he was
asked if his intention was to punish the publisher and author.
</P>
<P>
   The reply came in the calculus of an investment, which Armstrong
has agreed to repay at more than 12 percent interest from any
proceeds of a successful libel claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an interest in loaning Armstrong money,'' Milken said.
`` Armstrong is maintaining his own lawsuit. If Armstrong is
successful, then I get repaid. If that ends up hurting the
defendants, then that's a result of the lawsuit. I assume that
paying money is not something that they like to do.''

   ``We are all surprised what is possible at the end of the 20th
century in Europe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Havel strongly condemned the acts of revenge carried out by
Kosovo's majority Albanians, saying that they must ``live in peace
with the Serb minority, so that the Serbs have no reason to flee.''
</P>
<P>
   The Germans oversee one of five sectors in Kosovo, divided in
the peace agreement which is aimed at ending the NATO bombing of
Yugoslav forces, and allowing the return of roughly 1 million
Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   But the refugees' return _ weeks or months after they fled or
were kicked out of Kosovo by Serb forces _ has not been smooth:
Many Albanians, whose relatives were killed or who are returning to
destroyed houses, are seeking revenge against Serbs and their
property. In fear, tens of thousand of Serbs have fled Kosovo north
into Serbia proper.
</P>
<P>
   In the western city of Pec and the villages around it, the
houses of Serbs and Gypsies, often allied with the Serbs in Kosovo
against Albanians, have been burning for the last few days. In Belo
Polje, just outside Pec, Albanians with wheelbarrows looted the
houses on Sunday, saying that they were doing to the Serbs what the
Serbs had done to them.
</P>
<P>
   In Pristina, one of the two slaying victims, found dead outside
a post office, was a former employee with the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, which had monitored a
cease-fire in Kosovo last year. The employee was reportedly a
native of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Neither victim was identified Sunday night.

<P>
   A week after the last of the Serb military forces withdrew from
Kosovo, the next phase in the agreement between NATO and the KLA is
set to take place at midnight on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Already, KLA soldiers are not permitted to carry weapons in the
open or operate checkpoints, two prohibitions that seem largely to
be obeyed. But there are exceptions: on Sunday outside the western
town of Junik, half a dozen soldiers in KLA uniforms armed with
AK-47s were stopping cars to ask where passengers were going.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the KLA is required to have cleared its minefields
and booby traps, and to leave fighting positions and establish
sites for storing weapons, which NATO will be able to inspect.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday on Mount Pastrik, the mountain in southwestern Kosovo
that was a major battlefield in the war, KLA soldiers dragged
wagonloads of ammunition down a steep and rocky road. Nexhat Shala,
one of two soldiers guarding the cache itself _ mortars,
rocket-propelled grenades, land mines and bullets scattered in a
remote clearing _ said the ammunition had been brought over from
Albania in the last week or so.
</P>
<P>
   He said he assumed it would be handed over to NATO, although no
spokesman for the KLA could be reached for confirmation or comment.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Dietmar Jeserich, a spokesman for the German command,
said they were aware of the cache on Mount Pastrik and would make
sure it was properly reported and stored in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know about this,'' he said. ``And we will look at this
place.''

WITH INDONESIA'S `REFORMASI , ' PEOPLE ABOVE ARE LISTENING TO THOSE
BELOW  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ It was not a threat, said Wardah Hafidz,
one of Indonesia's toughest social activists; it was a simple
statement of the country's new balance of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can meet with 40 of us in your office,'' she told
officials of a government agency she was publicly accusing of
misuse of funds, ``or you can have 4,000 of us in the street
outside.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency, known as Bappenas, the national planning agency,
chose the private meeting. Also under pressure from Ms. Wardah, the
World Bank delayed a disbursement of welfare funds through
Bappenas, saying, ``The level of leakage this year has been too
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wardah, a slight and surprisingly shy-looking woman in her
40s, said, ``This is the first time Bappenas has been challenged by
the people to be publicly accountable. Before, they were way up in
the clouds. Corruption, bad planning _ whatever they wanted to do,
they just did it. Under Suharto, it was a completely top-down
system.''
</P>
<P>
   For better or worse, life was a lot simpler before President
Suharto was forced to resign a year ago by a surge of public anger,
after having just about everything his own way for 32 years.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is not quite clear in which direction power flows.
Government ministers, fearing an angry reaction, quickly shuffle
backward, smiling and gesturing defensively, when people like Ms.
Wardah advance on them.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wardah leads an independent group called the Urban Poor
Consortium, one of hundreds of nongovernmental organizations,
called NGOs for short, that have suddenly begun flexing their
muscles now that the dictator is gone.
</P>
<P>
   They are pushing agendas that include human rights,
environmental protection, workers' protection, legal aid and
political freedoms as well as rights for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   They are one building block of a new civil society that also
includes a noisy, take-no-prisoners free press; an always
unsatisfied, always demanding student movement, and a suddenly
liberated array of political parties that may not have clear
programs but are in no doubt that they want a share of the
political spoils.
</P>
<P>
   All these groups are part of a transformation of Indonesia that
is not quite a revolution. It is a banging, jostling realignment of
the traffic patterns of power, like a fairground arena of bumper
cars.
</P>
<P>
   For lack of a better word, this process is known as
``reformasi,'' or reform. For the moment its chief characteristic
is that the people above now have to listen to what the people
below are saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a complete change in terms of political participation and
political awareness,'' Ms. Wardah said. ``That means that for us,
for all the NGOs, it is a crucial moment to develop and become
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most remarkable displays of this shifting power,
another group, Indonesian Corruption Watch, forced the suspension
this month of Attorney General Andi Ghalib by publicizing
information that indicated he was involved in large-scale
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Ghalib was forced to step aside when it was revealed that
businessmen he was investigating on corruption charges had made
huge donations to the Indonesian Wrestling Foundation, of which he
is honorary chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wonderful to see, isn't it, how these freedoms are
actually working,'' a Western diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the men with guns _ the police officers and the army _ have
become cautious in the face of this newly empowered public. ``Now
the police say, `OK, you're having a rally. We'll be there but we
won't harass people,''' Ms. Wardah said.
</P>
<P>
   ``During Suharto's time, mass numbers of people were one thing
they were always afraid of and they never allowed,'' she said.
``Now the masses of people are in the open and those above are
nervous about it. They have no choice. They have to listen.''
</P>
<P>
   But the power struggle is not yet over. What Indonesians call
the forces of status quo are still fighting back against the forces
of reform. And it is possible that once a new government emerges
from the election that was held this month, new pressures will be
brought against independent groups like Ms. Wardah's.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are on the defensive,'' she said of the powers that be.
``Unfortunately, although they are on the defensive they are very
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   They tried their old tactics against her recently, hauling her
into a police station when she helped organize a demonstration by
workers who had lost their jobs at a biscuit factory.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `OK, let's start the interrogation,' and I said,
`No. Not without my lawyer,' and they said, `OK,''' Ms. Wardah
recalled. ``In Suharto's time they would torture you and force you
to agree with their version.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Soon the police station was crowded with about 20 lawyers, she
said, and after only one night in custody, she was released without
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto allowed the formation of nongovernmental interest groups
like hers, but he kept them under tight control _ ``quarantined in
seminars, workshops and hotel meeting rooms,'' as Ms. Wardah put
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like we were doing lots of things, but really it was
just among us,'' she said. ``We could not get our views published.
We couldn't speak up. We couldn't criticize. Nothing seeped down to
the grass roots. Nothing really happened. We called it turbulence
in a glass.''
</P>
<P>
   But all this activity served an important role in at least
voicing a poltical agenda, said Emmy Hafil, who heads Walhi,
Indonesia's leading environmental group. In the absence of real
opposition parties, organizations like hers became a de facto
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   When Suharto resigned and the political parties began to assert
themselves, Ms. Hafil said, she initially felt sidelined and
abandoned in this new, broad ``democratic space.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Oh my God, we are going to be lost somewhere,'''
she said. ``I felt that the political leaders had taken over our
roles, when in fact we had been performing their roles. So we had
to adjust ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   As both sides _ top and bottom _ adjust to Indonesia's new
patterns of power, Ms. Wardah said, there is a danger of
misjudgments and conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have reached the point of no return _ we can't go
back to the old practices,'' she said. ``That's where the danger
lies, if they don't realize that the context has changed, that the
rules of the game have changed. If they try to resort to the guns
and the money again, there may be high tension and perhaps
violence.''

   KOSOVO-SERBIA (Belgrade) _ The collapse of Greater Serbia can be
told through the story of one Serbian family, expelled from
Croatia, resettled near Belgrade, then bounced to Kosovo, and now
living in squalid housing outside Belgrade again. By Blaine Harden.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-BOMB-DAMAGE (Djakovica) _ In the two weeks since NATO
forces arrived in Kosovo, alliance officials have scaled back their
initial estimates of the damage inflicted by the 78-day air
campaign on the Yugoslav army, which they concede remains a force
capable of maintaining Slodoban Milosevic's grip on power. While
NATO and Pentagon officials stand by their claims to have
significantly damaged the Yugoslav army and special police, they
acknowledge that the units that withdrew from Kosovo a week ago
were clearly not as damaged as they had believed. By Steven Lee
Myers.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-U.S.-DRUGS (Undated) _ Last month, Project Hope, the
American medical charity, shipped $1.5-million worth of emergency
supplies to the Kosovo refugees. But relief workers desperate for
syringes, penicillin, and insulin found many of the hundreds of
boxes instead contained ChapStick, Preparation H, and anti-smoking
inhalers _ given by American companies that got a tax break for the
donations. The outpouring of aid from corporate America and
elsewhere for the roughly 700,000 refugees that flooded Albania and
Macedonia during the war between NATO and Yugoslavia was indeed
massive and included many badly needed medicines. But the World
Health Organization said about a third to half of all of the
shipments were essentially useless and are likely to just gather
dust in warehouses or be destroyed at government expense.
</P>
<P>
   (With graphic)
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-VILLAGE (Slovinje) _ They came here last Monday with a
simple but daunting mission: hold together one of the few villages
left in Kosovo where Albanian and Serb lived side by side. Backed
by helicopter gunships, the 30 British soldiers, seasoned officers
and infantrymen who had served in Northern Ireland or Bosnia, were
among the NATO troops in Kosovo most familiar with the bitter
divisions wrought by fear, revenge, and violence. In this farming
village of some 600 homes and 3,500 people in central Kosovo, the
British met a community that was in some ways an exception in this
ruined province. In Slovinje, Serbs and Albanians had lived in
relative harmony for decades. Yet, even here, the attempt to hold a
community together went wrong. By David Rohde.

</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MISSING (Dateline TK) _ About those still missing; many
of whom may be still held in prisons in Serbia. By Carlotta Gall.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-RDP (Prizren) _ German forces here announced Sunday they
will impose a curfew at night to cut down on lawlessness, which
continues around Kosovo in the form of yet more slayings, burning
of houses and looting. A man and a woman were shot to death
overnight in Dardanija, a northern suburb of the capital city,
Pristina. While officials said they did not know the motive,
another 14 people were reported slain in Pristina on Friday, many
of them Serbs killed in revenge by ethnic Albanians. By Ian Fisher.

CONSERVATIVES IN GOP ARE UNEASY ABOUT BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.H., Iowa)  (lb) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LACONIA, N.H. _ Many politically active conservatives say they
are increasingly frustrated and distressed by the early dominance
of George W. Bush in the Republican presidential race. They accuse
their party of sacrificing principle in the name of pragmatism,
prompting some to talk of mounting a third-party campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In early battleground states like New Hampshire and Iowa, and
elsewhere in the country, rank-and-file conservatives said in
interviews that they had never felt so alienated from their own
party.
</P>
<P>
   They asserted that Bush was not sufficiently conservative on
matters like abortion and complained about the defense _ if not
outright embrace _ of Bush by the party establishment, including
some leaders of their own wing, like Pat Robertson, founder of the
Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   They also cited compromises by Republican leaders in Washington
on issues like taxes, gun control, military spending and gay
rights. They are all the more uneasy, these conservatives said,
because they fear even at this early stage that Bush may be
unstoppable since no conservative champion has emerged from the
right to take on the governor of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The disenchantment is so intense that more and more
conservatives at the grass roots are openly discussing whether to
bolt from their party altogether. One conservative who is running
for president, Sen. Robert Smith of New Hampshire, said he was so
fed up that he would decide in the next 30 days whether to seek the
presidency by creating his own party or running as a member of the
Reform or U.S. Taxpayer party.
</P>
<P>
   Another conservative contender, Pat Buchanan, the television
commentator, insisted last week that he would remain in the
Republican contest. But some of his advisers have recently mulled
over whether he should seek the nomination of the Reform Party of
Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
   The discomfort among conservatives erupted in full view at a
town meeting in Manchester last week sponsored by Think New
Hampshire. The group was established by Jim Rubens, a former
Republican state senator who ran for governor last year, to promote
the party's principles. On a breezy summer night, more than 100
local Republicans gathered in an auditorium to stew over the state
of their party.
</P>
<P>
   The theme, as set out by Rubens at the start of the meeting, was
to ponder ``the gnawing question'' that he feared had
``demoralized'' Republicans: ``How do we resolve the tug of war
between principle and pragmatism _ between party ideals and the
pressure to compromise them?''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the audience voiced concerns that Republicans with an
eye on a general election victory in 2000 were moving too quickly
to dilute their positions on bedrock issues like abortion. Despite
Bush's command of the Republican field, not one participant
defended the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kenny, a freelance journalist in Manchester, drew
enthusiastic applause when he rose to a microphone in the audience
and asked: ``I wonder if any of us can tell the difference between
the Gore-Bush twins?''
</P>
<P>
   Kenny echoed many others who expressed concern about Bush,
including his refusal to rule out appointing court justices who are
not foes of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   David Corbin, a state representative in New Hampshire who
supports Alan Keyes for the nomination, said Bush might win the
nomination but lose the following November because he would not be
seen as standing for anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think George W. will win 35 percent of the New Hampshire
primary vote,'' Corbin said, ``but if the idea is winning at any
cost, it may do more damage to the Republican Party in the long
term.''
</P>
<P>
   In Davenport, Iowa, the state that traditionally holds the first
caucuses, David Karwoski, a religious conservative organizer, said
that if Bush captures the nomination he could lose as Bob Dole did
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you try to placate the pro-choice people and the pro-life
people at the same time,'' said Karwoski, who is backing Gary
Bauer, ``the people who feel strongly about those issues are going
to have a huge question in their mind: Is he really with us? Can we
trust him? There's going to be a rude awakening in November.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews around the country, many conservatives repeat the
same mantra: They are worried that Bush is getting ``anointed.'' As
Gordon MacDonald, the New Hampshire director for the campaign of
former Vice President Dan Quayle, put it, ``There's a real concern
that the establishment of the party is foisting on them a candidate
who won't stand for their principles. It's feeding this
alienation.''
</P>
<P>
   Many conservatives speak enthusiastically about the prospect of
abandoning the Republican Party. Citing how the Whigs unraveled in
the 1800s after the party was unable to reach a consensus on
slavery _ and paved the way for Republicans _ several conservatives
said Republicans could be similarly ravaged over abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to tell you I'm not optimistic about the future of the
Republican Party,'' Richard Lessner, director of the editorial page
of The Union Leader, a beacon of conservatism in Manchester, said
at the town meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to his participation on a radio talk show in Arizona
recently, Lessner said: ``What really sparked the telephone calls
is when the subject of third party came up. We can paper over this
talk. We can pretend that it doesn't exist. We can urge all
Republicans simply to set aside their differences and get together,
not shoot at one another, don't call one another nasty names,
everything will be happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the sentiment out there for a third party is real,''
Lessner continued. ``It is deep. And it is growing. We had call
after call on that radio talk show out there, people calling and
saying, `You know, I'm a conservative, but I've just about given up
on the Republican Party.'''
</P>
<P>
   Another speaker, Thomas Rath, a former state attorney general
who supports former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, implored the
audience to be more realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to stop ripping each other's throats out in
primaries,'' Rath said. ``Ronald Reagan was right when he said a
person who agrees with me 80 percent of the time is not my enemy.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   At a Republican barbecue on Sunday at the Belknap County 4-H
Fairgrounds near here, Elizabeth Dole, who runs a distant second to
Bush in most polls, said in an interview that the party needed to
be more pragmatic.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to her view that the party need not press for a
constitutional amendment on abortion, she said: ``This is a
dead-end discussion because it's not going to happen. Let's don't
fight each other in the party over something that doesn't have a
chance of happening. We're just churning and spending energy within
the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Such talk infuriates Smith. In weighing a third-party bid, he
said he was worried that in the eagerness to broaden its appeal the
Republican Party was forfeiting its principles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we have one political party in America: It's run by
moderate Democrats and moderate Republicans, and conservatives are
stuck,'' Smith said in an interview. ``If you talk to conservative
activists there's a lot of frustration. I have no desire to see the
demise of the party. But I'm not going to see our views
compromised.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Bush's impressive support, many conservatives are even
more unsettled because there are so many conservatives vying for
the nomination that their field is fractured and no one has emerged
to take on the leading candidate. Smith, Quayle, Buchanan and
Bauer, the former head of the Family Research Council, are
competing on the right with Steve Forbes, the wealthy publisher,
and Keyes, a former State Department official.
</P>
<P>
   One candidate on the right who seemed to be gaining steam among
conservatives last year was Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri. But he
decided not to make the race, in part because he faces a tough
re-election challenge in 2000. Compounding the difficulties is the
fact that religious conservative groups seem to be losing
influence, particularly the Christian Coalition, which has been in
turmoil in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The activists can't get together on one candidate,'' Smith
said. ``If all of us were one candidate instead of split up, we'd
have 15 to 20 percent in the polls right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans have little sympathy for such talk. They say
conservatives should be grateful that Bush is playing smart
politics as Bill Clinton did in 1992 when he moderated his
positions and called for welfare reform, a balanced budget and a
middle-class tax cut. As Clinton did, Bush is following more of a
general election strategy _ appeal to the broadest base of support
_ in the primaries. For now at least, polls show that it seems to
be working.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers say they are confident that the governor is
popular enough to withstand attacks from conservatives without
moving to the right. Still, the hope among Democrats is that Bush
will be forced to appeal more to conservatives, which would make
him more vulnerable in a general election, when he would want to
win votes from independents and even Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among conservatives there is an enormous frustration because
the party isn't what it was four years ago,'' said Roger Stone, a
Republican strategist who is a moderate. ``The Christian Coalition
is in hard times. There's a tremendous thirst in the party to win.
Therefore, it seems to me that Bush is getting the pass that Dole
didn't get. I don't see any of these other guys getting any
traction.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dave Philbrick, a conservative from Dover, is among those
who said he would not succumb to the allure of Bush as a candidate
who might win the general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather,'' Philbrick said, ``go to bed with a clear
conscience after losing.''

   WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass. _ For a bunch of burned-out souls, the
travelers along that lonely road known as the Camino Real are
sending off plenty of sparks. The inaugural production of the
Williamstown Theater Festival's new season finds the bright bounce
and energy, not to mention a gutsy sense of humor, in a thickly
poetic allegory of expiring hopes and trampled ideals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Camino Real'' takes its title from its setting, a brutal,
carnivalesque limbo that mirrored the geography of the soul of its
author, Tennessee Williams, as he slid into an unmoored middle age.
``As personal as a nightmare'' was how Elia Kazan, who directed the
play's premiere in 1953, described it. Williams wrote that the
work, which puts Don Quixote, Camille, Casanova and Lord Byron all
on the same stage, was ``nothing more nor less than my conception
of the time and the world I live in.''
</P>
<P>
   That world was, as Williams saw it, an ogre that crushed its
romantics and ate its artists for breakfast. This vision, as it
turned out, had its elements of immediate prophecy. ``Camino Real''
signaled the first serious rupture in the love affair between its
author and his public. Audiences of 1953 were bolting by the first
intermission, and critics choked on their disgust with the play's
pretension and obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   The more charitable suggested that perhaps this feverish
exercise in symbolism was meant simply to be read, as poems are.
Nonsense, Williams responded: ``Of all the works I have written,
this one was meant most for the vulgarity of the theater.''
</P>
<P>
   The interpretation at Williamstown, which has been directed at a
breathless clip by Nicholas Martin and memorably stars Ethan Hawke
as the ultimate American innocent, takes Williams at his word. It
is quite willfully vulgar, awash in neon colors and garish
costumes, with staging that evokes vaudeville, burlesque and the
Keystone Kops.
</P>
<P>
   But if the show sometimes muffles the play's more tender
lyricism, it also taps the vitality in despair that made Williams
such an essential theatrical force. You can't read a biography of
him without coming across a description of his laugh: a piercing,
hyenalike cackle that would erupt at the most unseemly moments.
This production seems to channel that laugh, creating a sense of
appalled hilarity, of guffawing defiantly at death's door.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Williams wrote ``Camino Real,'' his fame had begun
to smother him, and the paranoia that would dominate his later
years, fed by fears of betrayal and of loss of talent, had started
to fester. The play, he wrote in a letter to Kazan, was ``the story
of everyone's life after he has gone through the razzle-dazzle of
his youth.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's production _ designed with lurid flair by James Noone
(sets), Michael Krass (costumes) and Kevin Adams (lighting) _ picks
up on this sense of a head-splitting hangover, of a world turned so
bright and ugly that it is best viewed through dark glasses.
</P>
<P>
   The setting, a hotel-framed plaza with a Spanish accent, brings
to mind a misfired MGM musical of the 1950s, shot in sour
Technicolor. The choruslike ensemble variously suggests cartoon
versions of jet-setters, vampire prostitutes and sideshow barkers.
</P>
<P>
   The appropriately named Gutman (Jeffrey Jones), an oily Sidney
Greenstreet type, suavely and tyrannically presides over the
evening. And death shows up regularly, to the frantic piping of a
calliope, as a pair of giggling, simian street cleaners (Craig
Pattison and Ben Fox).
</P>
<P>
   Wandering through all the grotesquerie is a band of archetypal
figures who embody Williams' notions of how romance can tarnish.
The action, such as it is, is sprung by the arrival of Don Quixote
(John Seidman), the great, delusionary defender of heroic values,
who promptly falls asleep.
</P>
<P>
   Casanova (Richard Easton) is now an aging cuckold, and the woman
he adores, Marguerite Gautier (Blair Brown), aka Camille, has moved
beyond sacrificial love to seedy pickups and opium dens.
</P>
<P>
   Proust's Charlus (Christian Carmago), the gay esthete baron, has
been reduced to squalid trysts in the local men's flophouse. Lord
Byron (also Carmago) arrives to fret majestically, in some of
Williams' most heartfelt prose, over the squandering of his
vocation. And then there is Kilroy (Hawke), a onetime boxing
champion with ``a heart the size of a baby's head,'' who has been
told he could die at any instant.
</P>
<P>
   Kilroy is the essence of crude American idealism and
unquenchable energy, and Hawke plays him with a sweet, athletic
robustness that gives the production its motor and keeps it from
sinking into a parade of metaphors. This young actor, best known
for his work in stylishly hip mainstream movies, gives off a
kinetic intensity and exaggerated naivete that suggests a
contemporary answer to commedia dell'arte.
</P>
<P>
   It's a wonderful performance, both disciplined and spontaneous,
and when this Kilroy goes courting, in some of Williams' wittiest
dialogue, the evening approaches perfection. It helps that the
object of Kilroy's affections, Esmeralda, a lithe sexual commodity
in a harem costume, is played by the enchanting Hope Davis, who
once again appears right at home in a surreal situation. The shades
of satire and poignancy these performers mine from the words ``I am
sincere,'' which they repeat over and over, are remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown, television's winsome Molly Dodd in the 1980s, would
seem an odd choice for Camille. But the actress, who was terrific
as the frumpy landlady in the current Broadway revival of
``Cabaret,'' has been full of surprises lately, and she brings just
the right weary pragmatism to her over-the-hill courtesan. Like
Hawke, she has found a comfortable formula for playing allegory,
poised between caricature and emotional honesty, and she is well
matched by Easton's perpetually indignant, dignified Casanova.
</P>
<P>
   Not every performance works. Carmago, while a darkly amusing
Charlus, fares less well with Byron's fiery laments. Jones' Gutman
doesn't always get his mouth around his character's elaborate
running commentary. And the chorus often suggests those eager
extras in student productions who stand around muttering,
``Rhubarb, rhubarb.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There is, on the other hand, Kristine Nielsen as Esmeralda's
mother, a predatory Gypsy fortuneteller who looks and rather
behaves like Carmen Miranda. Ms. Nielsen was the electrifying
center of Christopher Durang's ``Betty's Summer Vacation,'' seen at
Playwrights Horizons in Manhattan this season under Martin's
direction, and both actress and director have imported the same
anarchic zing to ``Camino.''
</P>
<P>
   In his memoirs, Kazan wrote regretfully of ``Camino,'' saying
the naturalism with which he infused his interpretation ill served
the play. Martin doesn't make that mistake. There are still
passages of labored and literal-minded symbolism to wince over, and
it doesn't do to pause and linger too much in presenting this play;
in fact, it could kill it. Mercifully, this production, like
Hawke's Kilroy, stays alive by always moving, with flash and
frenzy, without trivializing the broken heart beneath.
</P>
<P>
   In the years after ``Camino,'' Williams' predictions of betrayal
and rejection were fulfilled. By the end of his career he was
scorned as a sad self-parody, at least in his own country.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 16 years after his death, theater artists are finding
treasure in Williams works long neglected or dismissed. Think of
the Drama Dept.'s inspiriting revision of his fabled flop,
``Kingdom of Earth,'' or Trevor Nunn's stunning resurrection of the
early, previously unproduced ``Not About Nightingales.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, in his art as in his life, Williams could be grotesquely
excessive and sloppy. But whatever he wrote, he tore it straight
from his soul, and in this age of irony there is something
especially nourishing in such sustained depths of emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say with any personal conviction that I have written a
good play,'' Williams wrote in his preface to ``Camino Real.'' ``I
only know that I have felt a release in this work which I wanted
you to feel with me.'' Martin, Hawke and company gleefully lead us
to this very peculiar but undeniable catharsis.

<P>
   DJAKOVICA, Yugoslavia _ In the two weeks since NATO forces
arrived in Kosovo, alliance officials have scaled back their
initial estimates of the damage inflicted by the 78-day air
campaign on the Yugoslav army, which they concede remains a force
capable of maintaining Slobodan Milosevic's hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO and Pentagon officials stand by their claims to have
significantly damaged the Yugoslav army and special police, they
acknowledge that the units that withdrew from Kosovo a week ago
were clearly not as hobbled as they had believed.
</P>
<P>
   And those forces, they acknowledge, could be employed by
Milosevic again, at least to squelch domestic disturbances within
Serbia, and at most to either foment or face down a separatist
threat from Yugoslavia's lesser republic, Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exaggerated,'' said a former senior allied official, who
spoke to top European leaders in recent days, referring to NATO's
early damage estimates. ``NATO hit a lot of dummy and deception
targets. It's an old Soviet ploy. Officials in Europe are very
subdued. No one's pounding their chest over this.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Djakovica, for example, NATO obliterated the Yugoslav
army's World War II-era base. In what was left of the motor pool,
18 military vehicles, including one armored personnel carrier, were
scattered Sunday in charred, twisted heaps.
</P>
<P>
   Up close, however, it was clear that most of the destroyed
vehicles were old wrecks, assembled there by the Serbs for repairs
or junking. NATO's warplanes had not destroyed Yugoslavia's
front-line fighting vehicles, but rather a junkyard.
</P>
<P>
   From blown-out military barracks to exploded fuel tanks, the
devastating results of NATO's bombing are obvious all across
Kosovo. But the damage brought down on the Yugoslav army itself _
particularly the tanks, armored fighting vehicles and artillery
batteries at its core _ is less clear.
</P>
<P>
   Even in those places where allied bombers launched intense
attacks _ in Junik and the villages around Mount Pastrik in
southern Kosovo where Yugoslav forces had massed against the Kosovo
Liberation Army in the last weeks of the war _ there are few signs
of the scorched carcasses of tanks or other military equipment that
NATO officials expected to find.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is here,'' Lt. Col. Dietmar Jeserick, a spokesman for
the German peacekeeping troops based in Prizren, said Sunday. ``We
found positions. We found bomb damage in those positions, but we
didn't find any vehicles or tanks.''
</P>
<P>
   While some vehicles were removed from Kosovo by Serb forces to
break down for spare parts, NATO officials themselves acknowledge
that fewer pieces of military hardware were destroyed than the
alliance had first estimated.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's supreme commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, said last week that
the alliance had, for example, destroyed 110 of the roughly 300
tanks that the Yugoslav army had poured into Kosovo. But that
number was less than the 150 tanks NATO believed it had destroyed
in the waning days of the war, one senior NATO official said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark and other NATO and Pentagon officials emphasize, however,
that NATO's bombing ultimately accomplished its mission, which was
to force Milosevic to end his brutal campaign against Kosovo's
ethnic Albanians and turn the province over to a NATO-led
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our perspective, we're satisfied we destroyed enough
stuff to get him to say, `Uncle,''' Capt. Stephan Pietropaoli of
the U.S. Navy, the spokesman for the Pentagon's Joint Chiefs of
Staff, said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   But whether it was indeed the pain inflicted on his military
that formed Milosevic's prime motivation for ending the standoff
over Kosovo is an open question.
</P>
<P>
   One senior NATO official said that many leaders at NATO believed
that it was not the damage to the Yugoslav forces that finally
forced Milosevic to relent, though the alliance intercepted
communications from Serb commanders saying that their troops were
suffering heavy losses in the battles around Mount Pastrik.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the official said, Milosevic relented when Russia, long
a supporter, came to accept NATO's conditions and the consensus for
considering a ground campaign to oust his forces from Kosovo
appeared to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Such an assessment may gain still greater currency as NATO takes
full stock of the size of the Yugoslav army that completed its
withdrawal from Kosovo a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   As the Serbs pulled out over 11 days, NATO commanders counted
220 tanks, 300 armored personnel carriers and 308 artillery
batteries, along with hundreds of other vehicles and all manner of
military equipment loaded on trucks, according to NATO officials
here and in Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   There were also 47,000 soldiers and police who left the
province, several thousand more than intelligence reports showed
during the height of Milosevic's campaign. The officials attributed
the discrepancy to paramilitary units, whose movements were harder
for NATO to track. But the large numbers also appeared to undercut
NATO's claims to have killed 5,000 to 10,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's government, eager to obscure the fact that it lost a
province considered by many Serbs to be Serbia's cultural,
religious and historical birthplace, has used state-run television
to show troops returning triumphantly from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks to reporters while visiting Kosovo last week, Clark
dismissed questions about the extent of NATO's punishment and
ridiculed Milosevic's claims as absurd. ``Just because the air
campaign stopped doesn't mean the Serb propaganda campaign
stopped,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that a complete picture would not be known until
NATO sends analysts here in the coming weeks to assess the success
of the airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has also announced that the deputy secretary of
defense, John Hamre, and the vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, Gen. Joseph Ralston, would lead a thorough review of the
war, including the damage done to the Yugoslav army.
</P>
<P>
   In war, initial assessments of damage are often overblown; the
oratory almost always is. After the Persian Gulf war ended in 1991,
the Pentagon learned that it had not hurt the Iraqi army nearly as
much as was first thought. The bombing and ground invasion by the
U.S.-led coalition left it badly beaten, but still strong enough to
put down rebellions in northern and southern Iraq and threaten
Kuwait again only three years later.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, there are several explanations for scaling back the
damage assessments now, officials said. Careful reviews of cockpit
video footage showed that pilots in some cases mistakenly believed
they had destroyed a target. They also showed that some of the
targets hit were not tanks or artillery batteries, but rather
clever decoys made by the Serbs to fool pilots flying three or four
miles up in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Outside its armed forces, however, Yugoslavia as a whole clearly
suffered enormous damage, particularly to its roads, bridges and
industry after 11 weeks of increasingly intense bombing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   According to a Pentagon assessment compiled after Milosevic
agreed to NATO's demands, allied warplanes destroyed Yugoslavia's
oil-refining ability, nearly half of its military fuel-storage
facilities and many of its factories producing military equipment
and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's air force was eviscerated, losing 14 of its 16 most
sophisticated fighters, Soviet-era MiG-29s, as well as 21 less
capable MiG-21s. NATO also badly damaged or destroyed numerous
military barracks and the headquarters of the Ministry of Defense,
the army and the air force.
</P>
<P>
   It also had some success against the ground forces operating in
Kosovo. On the day NATO suspended its strikes, U.S. Secretary of
Defense William Cohen said the air campaign had ``severely
crippled'' those forces.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Charles Wald, a senior analyst on the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, said that 60 percent of the barracks and other facilities of
Yugoslavia's Third Army in Kosovo had been either damaged or
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Not a single building at the army base in Djakovica was
habitable; many were leveled entirely. NATO bombs dug huge craters
in the earth, strewing debris everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also clear that the Serbs took advantage of the
restraints that kept allied pilots at high altitudes and under
orders to avoid civilian casualties, to escape greater destruction
of their heavy ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   Up and down western Kosovo, there are revetments where Serb
tanks and artillery pieces hunkered down, well hidden, particularly
at the foot of Mount Pastrik.
</P>
<P>
   There are also scores of decoys. Some of them involve older
vehicles fashioned to look like tanks. Others are comical. A few
miles west of Pristina, there is still a ``bridge'' of logs and
black tarp 100 yards from the main road. On either end were two
``tanks'' made of wood and plastic sheeting, with long tubes
protruding toward the sky.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, the decoys would fool no one, and NATO officials
said pilots quickly learned to distinguish them, but a fake bridge
near Djakovica took a missile right through its center span.
</P>
<P>
   At least one tank rests in a charred heap on a hill at a
military base near Urosevac, and local Albanians said several
remained in the hills above Junik, an area inaccessible because of
land mines.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger mystery is what happened to the tanks and other heavy
equipment that NATO did destroy. The senior NATO official said that
the retreating Serbs took a lot of damaged tanks with them,
ferrying them back on flatbed trucks to use as spare parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took out every last scrap they could,'' he said, ``so
when they get back to Yugoslavia, they can cannibalize bits and
pieces to put things back together.''

<P>
   SLOVINJE, Yugoslavia _ They came here last Monday with a simple
but daunting mission: Hold together one of the few villages left in
Kosovo where Albanian and Serb lived side by side.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by helicopter gunships, the 30 British soldiers, seasoned
officers and infantrymen who had served in Northern Ireland or
Bosnia, were among the NATO troops in Kosovo most familiar with the
bitter divisions wrought by fear, revenge and violence.
</P>
<P>
   In this farming village of some 600 homes and 3,500 people in
central Kosovo, the British met a community that was in some ways
an exception in this ruined province. In Slovinje, Serbs and
Albanians had lived in relative harmony for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even here, the attempt to hold a community together went
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The maelstrom of bloodshed and the emotions it engenders proved
more powerful than the British appeals for reason, or the bonds
that had survived the past decade of repressive Serbian rule of
Kosovo's majority Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   For this village was not spared the last three months of war. On
April 15 and 16, masked Serbian paramilitaries swept into the
village, killing some 40 people, including four women, according to
Albanians who say they witnessed the attack. In early May, local
Serbian police unearthed 16 bodies from two mass graves, and
allowed Albanians to rebury them.
</P>
<P>
   The attack was especially treacherous, Albanian villagers said,
because their Serb neighbors promised them the night before that
Slovinje would not be targeted.
</P>
<P>
   After the massacre, and the reburials, many of Slovinje's
Albanians fled, mostly to nearby Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last Monday, the British arrived. Over the next five days,
hundreds of embittered Albanian families streamed back into the
village, where some 30 of the original 40 or so Serb families
remained.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Graham Shannon, a boyish-looking 26-year-old, and his
soldiers struggled to surmount Balkan notions of just retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides will test us, seeing how we react,'' Shannon said,
hours after arriving in the ramshackle yellow schoolhouse turned
military base that the British soon dubbed ``the Alamo.'' ``But
it's something that our boys are used to.''
</P>
<P>
   The men of the British Army's Royal Irish Regiment indeed became
swiftly embroiled in confrontation. Five of the six cars they
stopped in the village on Monday had weapons. All were driven by
Albanians. The British suspected them of being Kosovo Liberation
Army soldiers filtering into town from the hills. As word spread of
the spot checks, fewer guns were found.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Albanian villagers streamed to the schoolhouse
with accounts of the massacre and names of local Serbs that they
said were perpetrators, recognized despite their masks. Shannon
took careful notes.
</P>
<P>
   When darkness fell, the British dispatched standard patrols,
four men on foot or in an armored personnel carrier, and began a
cat-and-mouse game they would play for nights_ chasing returning
Albanians who, finding their own homes looted, pillaged homes
abandoned by Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   One Albanian had returned to find that the Serbs had led a cow
inside his home. Herding it up to the second floor, they slashed
the animal's throat, gutted it and placed a live hand grenade in
its mid-section. Stinking pieces of rotting flesh hung from every
wall.
</P>
<P>
   The British arrested two looters that first night, dispatched
them from the schoolhouse to a larger British base 15 miles away,
where they were interrogated and, hours later, released.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon hoped the arrests might act as a deterrent. But dozens
of other looters had escaped into the night, and Serbs were
terrified.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday started quietly, but swiftly dissolved into chaos with
the kidnap of a 20-year-old Serb, Zoran Stanisic.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon and his men frantically launched foot, vehicle and
helicopter searches at 1:30 p.m. Meanwhile, Stanisic's 53-year-old
father, Milenko, who unlike most Kosovo Serbs speaks Albanian and
had long maintained ties with local Albanians, threatened his
Albanian neighbors of many years with death if they did not tell
him where his son was.
</P>
<P>
   The British spent 15 minutes calming the terrified Bytyqi
family, who just returned from a refugee camp in Macedonia, but Lt.
Shannon declined their request for a guard, saying he did not have
enough men. At 4:30 p.m., the Serb family came to the schoolhouse,
complaining that not enough was being done to find their son.
Stanisic said he had harmed no Albanians and even brought them tea
as they hid in the woods during NATO's air campaign. He asked why
his son had been kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of bad things happened here,'' Shannon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I didn't do it,'' Stanisic replied.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Shannon grew exasperated. ``You won't talk to the Albanians and
the Albanians won't talk to you,'' he said. ``We're stuck in the
middle here. The only way things are going to get better is if
people talk to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   After British soldiers escorted the Serb family home, Albanian
villagers disputed Stanisic's claim that he had brought them tea.
They said he and his son were not involved in the Slovinje
massacre, but that did not give them clean hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe his father was a paramilitary somewhere else and someone
wants to revenge him,'' said Izadin Pacolli, 27.
</P>
<P>
   As afternoon turned into evening, Albanians approached the
schoolhouse to report suspected mines or booby traps left by Serbs
in their homes. Shannon dispatched soldiers when he could, but
often told Albanians to lock a dog in the house for an hour and see
if it triggered a mine.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:45 p.m., the Serb family reported that an Albanian passed
by their house and drew a knife across his own throat. They begged
for a permanent guard. Again, Lt. Shannon refused, fearing by now
that everyone in the village would request such security.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at dusk, two Kosovo Liberation Army soldiers in uniform,
carrying ammunition but no weapons, appeared near the Serb family's
home. The British arrested them, citing a new accord between NATO
and the KLA that forbade the wearing of the uniform. Like the
looters before them, the KLA soldiers were questioned by military
police at the larger British base, then released. All that night,
the looting intensified, despite continuous British patrols.
</P>
<P>
   By midday Wednesday, Serb families were streaming out of
Slovinje, their possessions loaded on cars and tractors. Shannon
and his men urged them to stay. The Serbs complained that NATO
soldiers were not protecting them, and departed.
</P>
<P>
   Slobodan Trajkovic, 47, insisted as he left that he did not know
that Serbs were going to attack the village in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I knew the military was coming I would have taken my own
family away,'' he said. ``Because of all the military did, we are
paying.''
</P>
<P>
   Ibush Bytyqi, a 49-year-old Albanian who was principal of the
local elementary school, scoffed. He said local Serbs planned the
April attack, claiming as other villagers did that some of the
masked paramilitaries seemed to pick out victims as if they knew
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know what they've done and they won't be back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With ever more Serb houses standing empty, the British
confronted even more widespread looting on Wednesday night. A
patrol found an abandoned horse and cart and refrigerators, stoves
and washing machines placed beside a road, ready for pick-up. Two
looters were arrested, and again released after hours of
questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday dawned with the last Serb families in the village
loading their wares onto wagons. By then, Slovinje's Albanian
population had swelled to nearly 2,000 as refugees returned,
sometimes by the busload.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon got word that a Serbian man stopped at the checkpoint at
the entrance to town was on a British Army list of those suspected
of taking part in the April massacre. Military police arrested the
man that afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   At 2:45 p.m., Stanisic, the father of the kidnap victim,
departed on his tractor. ``I am alone. That's why I'm going. I
wanted to stay until they found him,'' he said, referring to his
still missing son. ``I am the last Serb to leave the village.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Slovinje, a village now purely Albanian, was calm and
tranquil. The Serbs may eventually be back, but the British were
frustrated nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   The hate and fear they see here, they said, resembles what they
saw in Northern Ireland. In both places, they argued, their
presence at least limits the violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do save lives in Northern Ireland, definitely, and we do
the same here,'' said Cpl. John Anthony Brennan. ``The weapons we
confiscated are used to kill people. We're doing good that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Shannon agreed, but seemed haunted by Stanisic. ``He is broken.
He is absolutely broken,'' the young lieutenant said. ``All he
wants is to get his son back. But I believe his son is dead.''

<P>
   ZAGREB, Croatia _ For a leader whose small Balkan state is
unable to pay pensions, save banks from collapse or stem mounting
discontent, Croatia's President Franjo Tudjman seems to have a
bizarre preoccupation with national myth.
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman, who last week speculated that had he not been a
politician he would probably have won the Nobel Prize as a
historian, has announced that he is sending scholars to Turkey to
investigate the influence of ancient Croats in the pre-Christian
Hittite civilization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Croats were around this area in 1800 BC,'' he said, seated
during a national television broadcast next to an ancient clay pot
that had a checkerboard design. ``The question now is, what role
did they play? Were they servants or masters?''
</P>
<P>
   It was the checkerboard, used here as the ubiquitous Croatian
national symbol, that tipped off Tudjman when he saw the design
among archaeological ruins during a visit to Turkey. While there,
the former communist general also informed his hosts that Croatia
had provided 30 of the Grand Viziers that ruled the Ottoman Empire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The checkerboard design signifies one thing to him and another
to other investigators,'' said Ivo Banac, a history professor at
Yale and political commentator in Croatia. ``Tudjman is a great
believer in the clash of civilizations and Croatia's role as a
front-line state against the Orthodox and Muslim East.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not sure,'' Banac added, ``how our new position as rulers
of the Ottoman Empire and the Hittites will be explained to us
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman, 77, and suffering from stomach cancer, may perhaps come
up with an explanation, and _ if so _ the media under his control,
particularly state television, are sure to disseminate it.
</P>
<P>
   His country, meanwhile, seems unlikely to radiate new Croatian
glory.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, police have often blocked the streets leading
to the Parliament building in the heart of old Zagreb, preventing
angry workers from voicing their dissent at going unpaid for
months. In May the state railway workers, and in June the employees
of state-run hotels, stopped work, striking at the heart of what
remains of Croatia's war-battered tourist trade.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Embassy, there are 28,000 companies
and firms that have their accounts blocked because they cannot pay
their bills. Opinion polls suggest that Tudjman's ruling Croatian
Democratic Union will be trounced by the opposition by a margin of
2-1 in parliamentary elections due later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman lives cocooned in his opulent presidential estate,
defying public outrage. He stubbornly insists, for example, that
the soccer team in Zagreb be called Croatia rather than its old
name, Dinamo, and he sits inside a near-empty stadium, watching
matches, while the boycotting fans have on occasion battled riot
police outside.
</P>
<P>
   Anger over Tudjman's meddling with the soccer club has been
exacerbated with the publication in the weekly newspaper Nacional
of wire taps, apparently leaked to the paper, that indicate that
referees have been blackmailed by the intelligence service to make
sure the president's favorite team wins the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to block the ongoing publication, anti-terrorist
police on Saturday raided the home of the publisher, Ivo Pukanic,
for the second time, looking for the documents. Police said they
would ask the state prosecutor to file charges that Pukanic
violated state secrets laws after they found classified national
intelligence documents at his home. Opposition politicians seized
on the statement as confirmation that the allegations against
Tudjman were true.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is all alone,'' said Tamara Pavlica, one of the directors
of the independent Radio 101. ``He surrounds himself with advisers
who tell him fairy tales.''
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman, whose virulent nationalism and penchant for domination
of an ethnically pure state have been outmatched in the Balkans
only by the tactics of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, is
increasingly relying on hard-line followers, including his chief
adviser, Ivic Pasalic.
</P>
<P>
   Pasalic, 37, comes from the Croat-controlled part of Bosnia
known as Herzegovina and controls the state security service. He
has forced out moderate members of the government, including a
former defense minister, Andrija Hebrang.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-line nationalists are increasingly public. They raised
over half a million dollars in an auction of paintings June 18 for
``our Croatian heroes'' awaiting trial for war crimes in the Hague,
Netherlands. The justice minister, Zvonimir Separovic, appeared at
the airport to embrace one of the convicted Croats, who returned
home after being sentenced by the international court to time
already served while awaiting trial.
</P>
<P>
   If the opposition coalition, headed by the Social Democrat Ivica
Racan, takes control of the Parliament, it is not clear that the
leaders of the ruling party, many of whom have grown rich from the
sale or control of state industries, will cede power without a
fight.
</P>
<P>
   Again following the example of Milosevic, who drew mass protests
when he prevented the opposition from taking the Belgrade mayor's
seat it won in elections in 1996, Tudjman prevented the opposition
from taking the mayor's office in Zagreb it won in city elections
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Tudjman escaped the popular ire that erupted at
Milosevic. Similar behavior with this year's parliamentary
elections, Western diplomats said, could unleash protests and
street clashes unseen in Croatia since Tudjman came to power in
1990 and began pushing for independence from the old Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever takes power will face grave difficulties,'' said
Racan, referring in particular to the hold of Tudjman's party,
known throughout Croatia by its local acronym, HDZ. ``The
Herzegovina lobby is strong and controls many powerful internal
structures. The economy and social situation are dire, but we must
break the grip the HDZ has on the country if we want to move from
an autocratic to a democratic state.''
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman appears unruffled. In his recent television appearance,
he blithely dismissed the growing strength of the opposition by
announcing that ``national issues are more important than
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides,'' he said, ``we know that between 15 and 20 percent
of the Croatian people are against the Croatian state.''

 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Remnick _ the editor of The New Yorker magazine
and Pulitzer Prize winning author _ wanted to talk to a reporter
over breakfast. But where? Remnick, a self-scrutinizing former
newspaper reporter who understands the art of the dramatic setup,
had doubts about the message his chosen venue would send.
</P>
<P>
   After running through two or three options, he said: ``How about
a plain coffee shop? Is a plain old coffee shop OK? Does that send
any kind of message?''
</P>
<P>
   In a way it does. Remnick's eventual, if slightly tortured,
choice _ a plain old Upper West Side coffee shop, complete with
plain old tepid coffee _ sent the clarion-clear message that
Remnick is a far different breed of editor than was Tina Brown, who
resigned suddenly from the stewardship of the 74-year-old magazine
last July, and who decisively favored the Four Seasons over formica
counter tops. In the words of Remnick, he is inescapably dogged by
``the old comparison that Tina was the glitz, and I'm at home
watching PBS.''
</P>
<P>
   The gulf between Ms. Brown's glitzy style and frenetic pace and
Remnick's more earnest, relaxed mien has become the defining
hallmark of his first year at the magazine. (His first anniversary
will be on July 14.) Ms. Brown, a churner of the elusive marketing
ingredient known as ``buzz,'' favored show business articles,
sometimes shocking photography and incendiary covers, and her
magazine made news _ not necessarily within its pages _ just as her
new venture, Talk, did last week landing on the front pages of both
New York City tabloid newspapers when the mayor refused to allow a
party introducing the new magazine to be held on city property.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Remnick does not attract much publicity. At his
version of The New Yorker, there are no guest editors, no sultry
photographs of the neighborhood dominatrix, no cloying fascination
with celebrity. As one executive with Advance Publications' Conde
Nast, which owns the magazine, said with a sniff befitting Eustace
Tilley, the monocled mascot of The New Yorker, ``The big difference
is that with David, you don't have to read in the morning papers
about who he had dinner with last night.''
</P>
<P>
   The author of four books, including ``Lenin's Tomb,'' which won
the 1994 Pulitzer Prize, Remnick favors longer pieces and has added
more local political coverage, more international political
coverage, more criticism, even more words in general (he has added
extra editorial pages, at extra cost to the magazine) _ and little
of it has generated the noisy, often outraged clamor in the news
media that many advertisers appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   David Verklin, chief executive at the Carat North America media
services agency in New York, which has clients like Pfizer, Chanel
and Philip Morris, said that Remnick's quieter magazine was harder
to sell to the young media planners who allocate advertising
budgets. ``Has it lost its buzz?'' he said of the magazine. ``No.
It has lost its Tina. When you come after the sun, even a
1,000-watt bulb can look dull.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1,000-watt bulb defended his approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you, that goes to stereotypes of what she did and what
I am beginning to do,'' Remnick said, munching on a twice-toasted
bagel. He wore an oxford shirt and no tie. ``Tina introduced,
visually, a lot of elements. She introduced color in a major way.
And we have to push both of those elements farther. But much more
importantly, I thought we needed better coverage of the city. We
needed to expand the geography of the magazine, and we needed to
strengthen the critics.''
</P>
<P>
   Remnick praised Ms. Brown's magazine, which featured many
respected writers like Connie Bruck, Richard Preston, William
Finnegan and Henry Louis Gates Jr. But he said that ``we had no art
critic,'' adding: ``There was the occasional piece by Simon Schama
or Adam Gopnik. But our identity as a magazine is based in
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling about The New Yorker is that it is not a magazine
of utility,'' Remnick said. ``It is not a magazine you use, like a
business magazine, where you must keep up with such-and-such an
industry. You get The New Yorker first and foremost for
entertainment, to be lifted out of the dullness, the ordinariness
of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as she is concerned, Ms. Brown said it was something of a
relief not to have to be the guardian of such an august, closely
monitored reputation. ``Editing The New Yorker was about being the
custodian of a treasure, as opposed to inventing from the ground
up,'' she said, adding that Remnick ``has taken my template, after
much creative frenzy, and is now doing something wonderful every
week and getting the best work out of the talent there.''
</P>
<P>
   Remnick's major changes, at first, seemed barely detectable. He
moved the humor column from the last page of the magazine to the
middle. He hired several new writers, including an art critic,
Peter Schjeldahl, from The Village Voice; a film critic, David
Denby, from New York magazine; and the book critic Nicholas Lemann.
He hired Pete Hamill ``to write whatever he wants,'' Remnick said.
To cover local and international politics, he hired Elizabeth
Kolbert and Michael Specter from The New York Times, where
Remnick's wife, Esther B. Fein, works. He shifted staff writers to
the critics' section, including Joan Acocella and Daphne Merkin. He
has added design elements _ photographs and art _ to enhance the
fiction, a category of writing overlooked in Ms. Brown's era.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New Yorker used to assault you,'' said John Seabrook, a
staff writer who has written for three editors _ Robert Gottlieb,
Ms. Brown and Remnick. ``Under David, I am sort of relieved by the
lack of breaking news stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Remnick, however, The New Yorker, does not always shy from
breaking stories. Monday's issue announced in a ``Talk of the
Town'' item that President Clinton might run for the Senate from
Arkansas in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But staff members say the difference in managerial style between
the two editors is striking.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Auletta, a staff writer, said: ``Tina was more rush, rush,
more willing to pick up the magazine and alter it at the last
minute. David is more relaxed, and is a very popular figure among
the staff. He's a guy who walks around in casual clothes and plops
into people's offices.''
</P>
<P>
   Seabrook, who is writing a book about the culture of American
taste as it is reflected in The New Yorker, said that Ms. Brown
``opened everything up, from lowbrow to highbrow.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``Now it is up to Remnick and all of us to make
the most of that situation _ to figure out a new set of values for
The New Yorker, one that is good for editorial and good for the
marketing. I'm not sure whether we know what this looks like yet.''
</P>
<P>
   While writers celebrate Remnick's casual demeanor, his aversion
to celebrity and the fact that he will never invite a sitcom
actress to guest-edit the magazine (like Ms. Brown did with
Roseanne Barr), advertisers are wary.
</P>
<P>
   Verklin of Carat North America said that The New Yorker ``has
become a bit more cerebral and a bit less pop cultural, and more
centered on its serious journalistic tradition; That makes the
publisher's job harder, because you're selling more steak and less
sizzle.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gene DeWitt, the president of DeWitt Media, which places ads for
clients like BMW _ which neglected to place a campaign in The New
Yorker last year even though it had in the past and even though BMW
ads appeared in virtually every other appropriate Conde Nast
magazine _ said that he was disappointed by the new regime and its
lack of unified vision. He said that David Carey, the magazine's
publisher, continued to rely on inserts and advertorials, which he
said were placed haphazardly, without regard to the editorial
content, throughout the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both extraordinarily competent,'' he said of Remnick
and Carey. ``On the other hand, the fiction issue looked as though
it fell down the stairs. It seemed very helter-skelter. I haven't
been concerned until the last issue.''
</P>
<P>
   There is some room for concern. The magazine continues to lose
money, according to executives at Conde Nast, although it no longer
loses close to the $32 million a year it did during the last year,
1992, that Steven Florio, now the president and chief executive
officer of Conde Nast, was president of the magazine. In addition
to losses estimated at a minimum of $10 million in 1998 by one
Conde Nast executive, Remnick has added extra editorial pages each
week _ often as many as 10 _ which adds an additional burden of
about $3 million each year. The editorial budget alone is $35
million each year, said a Conde Nast executive.
</P>
<P>
   S.I. Newhouse Jr., the chairman of Conde Nast, said of Remnick's
magazine: ``Readers have responded and if it took extra pages,
that's fine with me. David has a lot of latitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Ms. Brown, the magazine bulked up circulation _ largely
with discounted subscriptions that still do not make money for the
magazine _ from a low of 628,000 in 1992 to a high of 858,000 in
1996. For 1998, the average circulation was 813,000, according to
the Audit Bureau of Circulations. Ad pages have slipped, from 2,141
in 1997 to 1,960 for 1998, according to the Publishers Information
Bureau. From January to May 1998, the magazine carried 793 pages of
advertising, and for the same period this year, 710 pages, a
decline of 10.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Carey said that figure was not entirely reflective of the
magazine's health because there was one fewer issue in the time
period measured for 1999. In the end, he said, ad pages will total
more for 1999 than they did for 1998, in part because The New
Yorker has been sold to advertisers in a package with other Conde
Nast magazines since January. The policy attracts advertisers into
the magazine because if they want to place an ad in Vanity Fair or
Architectural Digest, they have to buy a package that includes
space in The New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   A recent example: Weber grills, which in the magazine's recent
fiction issue boasted a six-page spread, complemented by the work
of New Yorker cartoonists probably not used to writing witty lines
about barbecue grills.(``It's an amicable divorce,'' read one
caption underneath a cartoon showing two men lounging by a grill.
``She keeps the house, the furniture, and the car, and I keep the
grill.'')
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   In broad terms, the magazine industry is less vital than it was
during the period following World War II, when Americans relied
almost exclusively on magazines like The New Yorker for their most
provocative literature, an era when The New Yorker, not
coincidentally, sold 7,000 pages of advertising a year. This number
has slid from decade to decade, to 6,000 in the 1960's, then 3,000
in the 1980's, settling in at around 1,900 pages for last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has happened with every magazine,'' Carey said. ``There
are a million more options today. I don't care if you're The New
Yorker or if you're Forbes or Time, you're fighting many more
competitors as categories get sliced and diced.''
</P>
<P>
   If not through thousands of pages of advertising, one way that
The New Yorker could make money for Newhouse would be to go to a
biweekly schedule, an option that Carey has examined and that has
been a subject of debate inside the magazine. One former Conde Nast
executive who has studied the magazine's circulation model said
that The New Yorker would not make a profit as a weekly until it
sold 3,000 pages of advertising a year, sold subscriptions for $45
and sold more copies on the newsstand. Subscriptions now cost less
than $40, ad pages do not approach 3,000, and newsstand sales make
up only 5.3 percent of the magazine's total circulation.
</P>
<P>
   If the magazine shifted to publishing every other week, it could
make a profit by carrying just 1,500 pages of advertising a year,
and cut its production costs in half. Anecdotal evidence from
readers, say editors at The New Yorker, suggests they would respond
favorably _ ``almost with a sense of relief,'' said one editor _ to
the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Newhouse said he had no immediate plans to alter the magazine
from its 46-issue schedule.
</P>
<P>
   At Remnick's magazine, there is a sense of relaxation. Most of
the covers are planned for the rest of the summer, Remnick said.
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Hendrik Hertzberg, an editor who will have spent 30 years at the
magazine this year, said: ``The car runs more smoothly now. We
don't hit as many potholes.''
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Seabrook, in the meantime, is at work on two articles that may
not have found a place in Ms. Brown's New Yorker. He said that his
next published article in The New Yorker would be about sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody talks about it,'' he said. ``Everybody's obsessed
with it. Under Tina, could I have written about sleep? Well, maybe.
I don't know. And you know what? Now, I'm working on a story about
weather.'' &QL;

SERBIAN REFUGEES TIRED OF RUNNING FROM CONFLICTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   KRAGUJEVAC, Yugoslavia, _ Behind a door without a doorknob, in a
filthy school basement lighted by a single bare bulb, nine homeless
Serbs offered themselves Sunday as human report cards on Slobodan
Milosevic's crusade to cut a ``Greater Serbia'' from the ruins of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nine years in hell. That's my life,'' explained Radovan Grtic,
who came to the basement two days ago, after fleeing Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Grtic and the eight other Serbs in the room were all born in the
former Yugoslav republic of Croatia. That's where Milosevic's
nationalist schemes turned them into destitute wanderers,
threatened with death when they lived outside of Serbia and hustled
off to the hinterlands when they attempted to live inside its
borders.
</P>
<P>
   They have been chased from Croatia by the Croatian Army, then
hustled out of Serbia by Serbian police, then chased out of Kosovo
by vengeful Albanians and finally washed up here on the outskirts
of this down-on-its-luck factory town in central Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to American bombing during the Kosovo war, the sprawling
Zastava car and weapons plant that was the dominant employer in
Kragujevac has been ruined. The 6,000 Kosovo Serbs who have fled to
this city in the past two weeks are joining a local population of
about 150,000 people for whom unemployment is epidemic and where
local journalists say the major economic activity is smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   The dismal travels of the Serbs in the basement are a useful
guide in deciphering what three ethnic wars have wrought for the
two million or so Serbs who lived outside of the Serbia when
Milosevic came to power in 1988. Their grim, then grimmer and now
grimmest fortunes may also prove predictive of what lies ahead for
all 10 million Serbs as Greater Serbia has devolved into a
shrinking, impoverished, pariah state led by an indicted war
criminal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a clever man,'' said Grtic, who was a farmer before
he fled Croatia and a gravedigger before he fled Kosovo. ``But I
can see that my homeland in Croatia is not a part of Serbia. The
Serbs in Bosnia are not part of Serbia. Kosovo is not a part of
Serbia. Maybe next year, I think, it will be bloody all over
Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Serbs in the school basement, the war that led to their
first forced exodus began with a quick and rather intoxicating
series of victories, as have all three of Milosevic's military
adventures in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The post-Yugoslav Serbian Empire that Milosevic forcibly created
reached its territorial peak in the autumn and winter of 1992, the
fruit of Serb offensives, first in Croatia in 1991 and in Bosnia
the following year.
</P>
<P>
   That empire controlled about a third of Croatia and 70 percent
of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo, then, was constitutionally entitled to be an autonomous
province inside Serbia, where the Albanian majority would govern
most of their own affairs. But that autonomy had been crushed by
Serbian police and Yugoslav army forces.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's empire, however, lasted just three months at its
territorial fullest. It has been shrinking spasmodically ever since
_ most visibly this month when 21,000 NATO forces poured into
Kosovo, in effect, shearing it off from Serbia, which is the
dominant republic inside what is left of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The shrinkage started in Croatia in January of 1993, when the
Croatian army took back some strategic towns in the Krajina region.
The big loss, though, took place in August of 1995, when the Croats
launched an invasion that violently and, often savagely, pushed
about 170,000 Serbs out of Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   Grtic, then 19 years old and living in the scenic village of
Dvor Na Uni in eastern Croatia, was a farmer and Serb militiaman
when he learned the Croats were coming. He said he walked away from
his home and then hopped a truck.
</P>
<P>
   In a couple of weeks, he said, he found himself in the western
Serb town of Valjevo, which he liked and where he wanted to stay
and build a life.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, thinking back, I most blame the Serb police who forced
me to leave Valjevo,'' Grtic said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was forced to ``volunteer'' to be a settler in
Kosovo, a territory that Kosovar Serbs had been fleeing from for
decades because of conflicts there with the growing ethnic Albanian
population. The Milosevic regime, having risen to power on promises
of maintaining control in Kosovo, which many Serbs regard as their
holy land, tried to pressure Serb refugees from Croatia and from
Bosnia to move to the poor and mostly rural province.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, only a few thousand Serbs, mostly poor people
without any family or business connection inside Serbia, were
unable to figure out a way not to go to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Grtic was among those who had no alternative but to do as Serb
officials instructed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me I would be given a house in Kosovo and a job,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived in the Kosovo city of Pec, however, Grtic was
taken to a resettlement center, where he spent nearly four years
sharing a room 14 other displaced Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Down in the basement Sunday, Juba Tesla, 48, a Serb farmer who
lay on a bed surrounded by his wife and four children, told a
similar story of being elbowed out of Serbia in 1995 after Croats
from his birthplace in the Krajina region of Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Croats were coming, we ran away,'' said Tesla, who
drove out of Croatia in a tractor, pulling a wagon loaded with his
family and his life's possessions. ``In Bosnia, we were led to a
train and I went to sleep thinking that I would wake up in
Belgrade.''
</P>
<P>
   Tesla, though, woke up in Kosovo, where he was encouraged by
Serb authorities to settle in the town of Dzurakovac, not far from
Pec. He worked there for nearly four years as day laborer, until
NATO's 10-week war with Yugoslavia over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   During the war, when hundreds of thousands of Albanians fled
Kosovo and many thousands were killed by Serb forces, Tesla and
Grtic said they took no part in forcing the Albanians to flee. But
they also made it clear that they were not especially upset to see
them go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serbs have had enough of the Albanians,'' said Grtic. ``Serbs
have suffered from them since 1389.'' He referred to the fateful
Battle of Kosovo, which was won by the Ottoman Turks but is
regarded by the history-obsessed Serbs as a glorious show of
courage in defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Grtic said he was aware that atrocities were committed by Serbs
against Albanians in Pec and he thought it was prudent to get out
of town before their angry relatives and friends came back.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived here in Kragujevac with a suitcase and, he said, no
idea of where he was going to go now or what he was going to do.
Asked who he blames for his multiple exiles inside the former
Yugoslavia, Grtic grunted, ``Slobo,'' the popular name of
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took Serb forces out of Kosovo. It is not safe for me to
live there. He allowed the Albanians everything they wanted,''
Grtic said.
</P>
<P>
   On a basement bed next to Grtic, Tesla was not willing to single
out any politician. He said he blamed the leaders of Croatia,
Bosnia and Serbia equally. But he said he and his family were not
angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not angry, we are desperate,'' he said. ``We haven't
got the energy for anger. We don't know long we will have to
travel.''

<P>
   KOSOVO-BOMB-DAMAGE (Djakovica) _ In the two weeks since NATO
forces arrived in Kosovo, alliance officials have scaled back their

capable of maintaining Slodoban Milosevic's grip on power. While
NATO and Pentagon officials stand by their claims to have
significantly damaged the Yugoslav army and special police, they
acknowledge that the units that withdrew from Kosovo a week ago
were clearly not as damaged as they had believed. By Steven Lee

MARKET PLACE: PRICE ISN'T THE WHOLE GAME IN A PHONE INDUSTRY
BIDDING WAR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the board of the Frontier Corp. meets Monday, as expected,
to discuss the unsolicited bid made by Qwest Communications
International Inc., the debate will be far from elementary.
</P>
<P>
   That's because nothing is ever as simple as it looks. Global
Crossing Ltd., Qwest's telecommunications rival, agreed to buy
Frontier, the nation's fifth-largest long-distance phone company,
in March. Global is offering $63 in stock for each Frontier share
as long as Global's shares trade within a range of $34.56 to
$56.78. Global also recently agreed to merge with U S West, the
smallest of the regional Bell telephone companies, offering $60 in
Global stock plus a $1 special dividend for each U S West share.
</P>
<P>
   But Qwest surprised investors two weeks ago, making hostile
offers for both Frontier and U S West and then revising its bids
last week to make them more appealing than Global's. Qwest is
offering Frontier shareholders a total of $68 ($20 in cash and $48
in Qwest stock or cash) and U S West shareholders $69 in stock or
cash as long as Qwest's stock trades in a range of $30.50 to
$43.50.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, the offers appear clear-cut. But under the
terms of their deals with Global Crossing, the boards of both
companies have to conclude that Qwest's offer is adequately
``superior'' to Global's before they can begin negotiations with
Qwest. (U S West's board is expected to meet later this week.) Some
of the issues they will be discussing include these:
</P>
<P>
   STRATEGIC VALUE: Few investors are fully convinced of the
soundness of the strategic rationale of either Qwest or Global
Crossing. U S West, often called ``U S Worst'' by analysts, is one
of the most troubled Bell companies. But U S West and Frontier have
what Qwest and Global Crossing, both upstarts, say they need _ cash
and customers. In essence, what the boards of U S West and Frontier
have to decide is whether Global Crossing or Qwest has the better
vision to take their companies into the new telecommunications age,
combining conventional cable and copper wires with the digital
universe of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   William Deatherage, a telecommunications analyst at Bear,
Stearns, warns that a company created by the merger of U S West,
Frontier and Global Crossing would still not have ``the critical
mass of other national companies,'' like AT&AMP;T. Speaking of Qwest's
bid, he noted that the company has several hurdles to overcome but
added that a combination of Qwest, U S West and Frontier would have
``the makings of a credible competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Qwest, a two-year-old company, is further along in its
development than Global Crossing. Already, Qwest has 8,500
employees, and it had 1998 revenues of $2.24 billion. In the United
States, it has more than 18,500 miles of fiber optic cables and is
set to complete that nationwide network this month. It is also
expanding into Mexico and has joint ventures in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Global Crossing has one operating undersea cable, with several
others still under construction and expected to be complete within
a year. It went public last year, and revenues at the end of 1998
totaled $424 million. By the end of this week, it will employ about
1,500 people.
</P>
<P>
   DEAL STRUCTURE: Global Crossing has signed merger agreements
with U S West and Frontier and said it did not plan to increase its
bid. Global plans to create two kinds of stock in the combined
company, one representing shares of its high-growth Internet
assets, the other made up of the slower-growing telephone assets.
But the deal's structure, while novel, poses a challenge to
investors who want to compare it with Qwest's offer.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest said it would combine fast- and slow-growing assets into
one telecommunications hybrid. That concerns investors who bought
Qwest shares with the hope of turbo-charged growth. An acquisition
of U S West could cut Qwest's growth rate nearly in half.
</P>
<P>
   Because the demand for a global telecommunications network is
being driven by expansion of the Internet, Qwest's and Global
Crossing's shares experience the sharp swings characteristic of
Internet stocks. When Qwest revised its bid on Wednesday, it added
the trading range to protect Frontier and U S West shareholders in
case Qwest's stock should plummet further.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Nacchio, the chief executive of Qwest, said the company
made the move in response to concerns expressed by Frontier and U S
West. (Downside protection was a sticking point in Global
Crossing's negotiations with Frontier, too.) But it is yet to be
seen if the range _ Qwest is trading near the bottom _ provides
enough comfort to appease both boards.
</P>
<P>
   REGULATORY RISKS: Here Global Crossing and Qwest are faced with
similar issues: U S West is restricted from offering long-distance
service in its 14-state territory until it proves to regulators
that its local markets are open to competition.
</P>
<P>
   Global Crossing, which is based in Bermuda, has no assets yet in
the United States, so its regulatory concerns are limited to
Frontier's customer overlap in U S West's territory. Qwest doesn't
have it so easy. It is the fourth-largest domestic long-distance
company and Frontier is No. 5. For Qwest to buy both Frontier and U
S West, it would need to shed a considerable number of
long-distance customers in U S West's region. Qwest has said it
would do whatever is necessary to satisfy regulators. Like any
deal, this one could take months to close, giving U S West time to
open local markets. But the uncertainty is something the boards
will have to consider.

CONGRESS TO DEBATE COMPENSATION OF ASBESTOS VICTIMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Exclusive) 
(lb) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After the Supreme Court threw up its hands in
exasperation last week, Congress is preparing to begin debate on
Thursday on a new measure that would dramatically overhaul the way
the legal system resolves lawsuits brought by people harmed by
asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   On the last day of its term, as it rejected a settlement of
asbestos litigation approved by two lower courts, the court
implored Congress to devise a legislative solution to ``the
elephantine mass of asbestos cases'' that the justices said were
clogging federal and state dockets, enriching lawyers in protracted
court proceedings that ultimately leave many victims of asbestos
poisoning with little or nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Taking up the court's request, the House Judiciary Committee
will begin hearings this week in an attempt to build support for
legislation that would dramatically alter the current legal regime
for handling asbestos cases.
</P>
<P>
   The fight over the legislation features some of Washington's
most powerful interests, pitting larger manufacturers of asbestos
and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce against the trial lawyers and
unions.
</P>
<P>
   Since more asbestos claims are filed in federal and state courts
than any other kind of civil case, the debate in Congress is part
of a larger fight over the United States' system for resolving tort
cases. But asbestos cases have proved to be a particular challenge
for judges and the courts because of the nature of the ailments
that the substance causes.
</P>
<P>
   Exposure to asbestos may not manifest injuries until decades
later, and illnesses it may cause range from the relatively minor
to the deadly. The AFL-CIO, which opposes the legislation,
estimates that as many as 1 million of its current and retired
members were exposed to asbestos; many of them will develop
debilitating or deadly ailments.
</P>
<P>
   A judicial study cited by the Supreme Court predicted that there
may be as many as 265,000 asbestos-related deaths by the year 2015.
</P>
<P>
   The delay in appearance of symptoms has made it difficult for
some asbestos makers to calculate their potential liabilities and
estimate how much they will need to pay over the next several
decades. It has also raised concerns that the current victims, in
winning large verdicts that may include punitive damages, will
deplete the available money long before all of the victims of
asbestos make it to the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   The measures under consideration by Congress eliminate punitive
damages in asbestos cases, prohibit victims from making use of the
often more generous state court systems, and cap lawyers' fees at a
maximum of 25 percent of settlements.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would create an administrative agency financed
by the industry and its insurers to process the hundreds of
thousands of pending claims filed by workers who have been exposed
to asbestos since the 1940s. Claimants could go to court to seek
more money, but only after exhausting a hearing and mediation
process run by the new agency.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also eliminates any barriers to bringing
lawsuits posed by the statute of limitations. Its supporters say it
will result in far more claims being resolved far faster and at
lower cost.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bills that set up the agency, known as Asbestos Resolution
Corp., enjoy broad bipartisan support in similar bills introduced
in the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation has been endorsed by the Republican chairmen of
the judiciary committees, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah and Rep. Henry
Hyde of Illinois, and a number of leading Democrats, as well as the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce and several large and powerful former
manufacturers of asbestos products, led by GAF Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Among the supporters retained by GAF is Christopher Edley Jr. of
Harvard Law School, a former top adviser to President Clinton on
racial issues, who will testify on the legislation's behalf at the
hearing on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Weinberg, executive vice president and general counsel
of GAF, said, ``The Supreme Court's decision confirms in the
starkest terms the need for a legislative solution to a crisis
which has defied any solution for 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   But labor groups, trial lawyers and some consumer organizations
oppose the measure, saying that to the extent there are problems in
the courts, the legislative solution would actually make matters
worse for everyone but the handful of companies like GAF that want
to limit their potential liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation just creates a new federal bureaucracy which
at the end of the day won't provide any payments to anybody,'' said
Joseph Rice, a plaintiff's lawyer from Charleston, S.C., who found
himself on the losing end of last week's Supreme Court decision.
</P>
<P>
   The decision struck down a landmark $1.5 billion settlement that
would have compensated as many as 186,000 victims. The court's
majority suggested that the plaintiffs' lawyers who structured it
had a possible conflict of interest between getting the most for
their clients and striking a quick deal that would garner huge
legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, say
that the courts are not encountering any significant problems in
resolving these cases, and they take issue with the Supreme Court's
conclusions that delays have become too routine, trials are too
long, the same issues keep getting litigated over and over, and
lawyers' costs exceed the victims' recoveries by nearly two to one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need legislation that is basically just going to bail
out one corporation,'' said Richard Middleton, a Georgia lawyer who
is the president-elect of the Association of Trial Lawyers of
America.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers representing organized labor agree, although they are
far more critical of the court system's failures to resolve the
cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our view is not the ATLA view that everything is fine,'' said
Damon Silvers, an associate general counsel of the AFL-CIO. ``There
are serious problems with the current system. But the bills are not
the right solution, because they close off access to the courts,
and they will not ultimately reduce the transaction costs.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Strengthening low pressure colliding with a very warm and humid
air mass over the southern Great Lakes will trigger many showers
and thunderstorms on Monday. As the low moves to the east, abundant
amounts of moisture in the atmosphere will lead to thunderstorms
with locally heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
   A jet-stream disturbance at 18,000 feet passing over the
Carolinas will bring an area of clouds, showers, and thunderstorms
to the Outer Banks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a weak warm front pushing through northern New
England will usher showers into parts of Maine and New Hampshire.
This front marks the leading edge of a very warm and humid air
mass. The Northeast and much of the Middle Atlantic States will
experience yet another day of sultry conditions, with scattered
afternoon storms possible.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure sliding along the northern border of North Dakota
will draw cooler, drier air to the south over the northern Plains.
On the southern periphery of this high, a moist flow from the
southeast will encourage thunderstorm development over the
mountains of Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Northwest will stay unseasonably cool and damp, as
yet another upper-air disturbance brings clouds and a few showers
to parts of the Washington coast and into the Cascades.
</P>
<P>
   The Southwest will remain very hot and dry, with only a few
afternoon thunderstorms developing over the mountains of Arizona.
Some of this very warm air aloft will move over parts of Texas and
Oklahoma, preventing the development of any regions of widespread
storms.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Northern Contrasts
</P>
<P>
   Two surges of hot air into upper Michigan sent the mercury to a
record high of 89 degrees early Saturday afternoon and then 90
degrees later in the day at Marquette. Meanwhile, at daybreak
Sunday, the temperature fell to 34 degrees at Williston, N.D.,
eclipsing the previous record by 5 degrees. The contrasting records
in the northern tier indicate a strengthening jet stream, which is
driven by such thermal contrasts. Indeed, weather systems that
drifted across the nation last week will pick up the pace this
week, bringing frequent changes to the border states.

THIS WEEK'S TV HIGHLIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
TODAY 
Even a non-tennis fan can appreciate today on Centre Court at
Wimbledon: American Jim Courier tries to topple British favorite
Tim Henman, former champ Boris Becker plays what should be his
final match on the All-England facility against Patrick Rafter, and
then there's all the glitter of Venus Williams vs. Anna Kournikova.
Jolly good. Wimbledon, Channel 4 and HBO, 9 a.m. (NBC and HBO have
weekday coverage each morning). 
TUESDAY 
You hear about those people who, in a fit of despair, fancy jumping
off the Golden Gate Bridge. But imagine how it could be prevented
if a permanent bungee-jumping platform was installed this week
during the X Games. Here, you give them a chance to reconsider,
right? See, the X Games can benefit society. On the other hand, HBO
has this hour-long documentary that dispels the myth that sports
isn't a life-or-death situation. X Games: Bicycle stunt riding,
skateboarding and sky surfing, ESPN2, 6 p.m. and ESPN, 10 p.m.
(Airs each day at the same times on ESPN2 and ESPN, with ABC's
``Wide World of Sports'' devoting an hour to it Saturday and Sunday
at 2 p.m.); ``Xtreme: Sports To Die For,'' HBO, 8 p.m. 
WEDNESDAY 
With the first pick of the 1999 NBA Draft, the Chicago Bulls select
Richard Simmons _ to pull Jerry Krause from the buffet table, chain
him to a Stairmaster and try to make him at least presentable in
public. NBA Draft, TNT, 4:30 p.m. 
THURSDAY 
In the quarterfinal elimination match, our beloved U.S. team faces
Brazil/Germany/Italy. Win or lose, we've got to find a way to
stretch this thing another three weeks. Women's World Cup
quarterfinals, ESPN, 4 p.m. and ESPN2, 6:30 p.m. (ESPN also has two
quarterfinal games Wednesday at 5 p.m. and 9 p.m.) 
FRIDAY 
The real fireworks don't start until after Sunday's matinee, but
the fuse should be lit for these two all weekend. Giants at
Dodgers, Channel 5, 7:10 p.m. (Fox Channel 11 has Saturday's game
at 1:05 p.m.) 
SATURDAY 
Last year's Pepsi 400 was supposed to be the first auto race ever
broadcast live in prime time on network television, but wildfires
in Daytona Beach and the surrounding areas snuffed that one out. So
they'll try it again this year. Gentlemen, start your headlights.
NASCAR Winston Cup Pepsi 400 from Daytona Beach, Fla., Channel 2, 5
p.m. 
SUNDAY 
Since this will be the last Fourth of July of the 1900s, we'd like
to see Bud Collins in red, white and blue striped pants doing
commentary on an all-American men's final at Wimbledon. We're
banking on Pete Sampras steering clear to make it to a match
against Andre Agassi, if he's up to it. As for Collins, he
represents why we had the revolution in the first place _ to gain
the freedom to make as big a fool of ourselves as we want to.
Wimbledon men's final, Channel 4, 6 a.m. (NBC also has the women's
final Saturday at 6 a.m.).

 DJAKOVICA, Yugoslavia: intense bombing.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   According to a Pentagon assessment compiled after Milosevic
agreed to NATO's demands, allied warplanes destroyed Yugoslavia's
oil-refining ability, nearly half of its military fuel-storage
facilities and many of its factories producing military equipment
and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's air force was eviscerated, losing 14 of its 16 most
sophisticated fighters, Soviet-era MiG-29s, as well as 21 less
capable MiG-21s. NATO also badly damaged or destroyed numerous
military barracks and the headquarters of the Ministry of Defense,
the army and the air force.
</P>
<P>
   It also had some success against the ground forces operating in
Kosovo. On the day NATO suspended its strikes, U.S. Secretary of
Defense William Cohen said the air campaign had ``severely
crippled'' those forces.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Charles Wald, a senior analyst on the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, said that 60 percent of the barracks and other facilities of
Yugoslavia's Third Army in Kosovo had been either damaged or
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Not a single building at the army base in Djakovica was
habitable; many were leveled entirely. NATO bombs dug huge craters
in the earth, strewing debris everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also clear that the Serbs took advantage of the
restraints that kept allied pilots at high altitudes and under
orders to avoid civilian casualties, to escape greater destruction
of their heavy ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   Up and down western Kosovo, there are revetments where Serb
tanks and artillery pieces hunkered down, well hidden, particularly
at the foot of Mount Pastrik.
</P>
<P>
   There are also scores of decoys. Some of them involve older
vehicles fashioned to look like tanks. Others are comical. A few
miles west of Pristina, there is still a ``bridge'' of logs and
black tarp 100 yards from the main road. On either end were two
``tanks'' made of wood and plastic sheeting, with long tubes
protruding toward the sky.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, the decoys would fool no one, and NATO officials
said pilots quickly learned to distinguish them, but a fake bridge
near Djakovica took a missile right through its center span.
</P>
<P>
   At least one tank rests in a charred heap on a hill at a
military base near Urosevac, and local Albanians said several
remained in the hills above Junik, an area inaccessible because of
land mines.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger mystery is what happened to the tanks and other heavy
equipment that NATO did destroy. The senior NATO official said that
the retreating Serbs took a lot of damaged tanks with them,
ferrying them back on flatbed trucks to use as spare parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took out every last scrap they could,'' he said, ``so
when they get back to Yugoslavia, they can cannibalize bits and
pieces to put things back together.''

 SLOVINJE: Stanisic replied. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shannon grew exasperated. ``You won't talk to the Albanians and
the Albanians won't talk to you,'' he said. ``We're stuck in the
middle here. The only way things are going to get better is if
people talk to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   After British soldiers escorted the Serb family home, Albanian
villagers disputed Stanisic's claim that he had brought them tea.
They said he and his son were not involved in the Slovinje
massacre, but that did not give them clean hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe his father was a paramilitary somewhere else and someone
wants to revenge him,'' said Izadin Pacolli, 27.
</P>
<P>
   As afternoon turned into evening, Albanians approached the
schoolhouse to report suspected mines or booby traps left by Serbs
in their homes. Shannon dispatched soldiers when he could, but
often told Albanians to lock a dog in the house for an hour and see
if it triggered a mine.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:45 p.m., the Serb family reported that an Albanian passed
by their house and drew a knife across his own throat. They begged
for a permanent guard. Again, Lt. Shannon refused, fearing by now
that everyone in the village would request such security.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at dusk, two Kosovo Liberation Army soldiers in uniform,
carrying ammunition but no weapons, appeared near the Serb family's
home. The British arrested them, citing a new accord between NATO
and the KLA that forbade the wearing of the uniform. Like the
looters before them, the KLA soldiers were questioned by military
police at the larger British base, then released. All that night,
the looting intensified, despite continuous British patrols.
</P>
<P>
   By midday Wednesday, Serb families were streaming out of
Slovinje, their possessions loaded on cars and tractors. Shannon
and his men urged them to stay. The Serbs complained that NATO
soldiers were not protecting them, and departed.
</P>
<P>
   Slobodan Trajkovic, 47, insisted as he left that he did not know
that Serbs were going to attack the village in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I knew the military was coming I would have taken my own
family away,'' he said. ``Because of all the military did, we are
paying.''
</P>
<P>
   Ibush Bytyqi, a 49-year-old Albanian who was principal of the
local elementary school, scoffed. He said local Serbs planned the
April attack, claiming as other villagers did that some of the
masked paramilitaries seemed to pick out victims as if they knew
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know what they've done and they won't be back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With ever more Serb houses standing empty, the British
confronted even more widespread looting on Wednesday night. A
patrol found an abandoned horse and cart and refrigerators, stoves
and washing machines placed beside a road, ready for pick-up. Two
looters were arrested, and again released after hours of
questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday dawned with the last Serb families in the village
loading their wares onto wagons. By then, Slovinje's Albanian
population had swelled to nearly 2,000 as refugees returned,
sometimes by the busload.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon got word that a Serbian man stopped at the checkpoint at
the entrance to town was on a British Army list of those suspected
of taking part in the April massacre. Military police arrested the
man that afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   At 2:45 p.m., Stanisic, the father of the kidnap victim,
departed on his tractor. ``I am alone. That's why I'm going. I
wanted to stay until they found him,'' he said, referring to his
still missing son. ``I am the last Serb to leave the village.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Slovinje, a village now purely Albanian, was calm and
tranquil. The Serbs may eventually be back, but the British were
frustrated nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   The hate and fear they see here, they said, resembles what they
saw in Northern Ireland. In both places, they argued, their
presence at least limits the violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do save lives in Northern Ireland, definitely, and we do
the same here,'' said Cpl. John Anthony Brennan. ``The weapons we
confiscated are used to kill people. We're doing good that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Shannon agreed, but seemed haunted by Stanisic. ``He is broken.
He is absolutely broken,'' the young lieutenant said. ``All he
wants is to get his son back. But I believe his son is dead.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gay men in New York City have significantly reduced
their levels of risky sexual behavior, and the number of men
infected with the AIDS virus has dropped sharply over the last 15
years, city health officials said in issuing findings Sunday from
the largest survey ever of gay men's sexual health.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, conducted last year in an unusual partnership
between the city and the Gay Men's Health Crisis, offers what they
said is the clearest picture of how sexual practices of gay and
bisexual men have changed in response to the AIDS epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was completed by 7,650 homosexual and bisexual men,
whose age ranged from 12 to 88 and averaged 34.5 years old.
</P>
<P>
   HIV infection rates among gay men are lower than commonly
believed, the survey found. About one in seven participants said
they were infected, a drop from studies in 1985 showing an
infection rate of one in three in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   About nine in 10 participants said they had been tested for
infection with HIV, the AIDS virus, and eight in 10 were tested
within the three years preceding the survey. Men less than 24 years
and those 60 years and older were less likely to have had a test.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also indicated that young gay men are heeding
messages about the need for precautions. Use of condoms for first
anal intercourse rose to 78 percent in 1998 from 34 percent in
1985, said Dr. Tracy Mayne, the director of epidemiology for the
New York City Health Department's AIDS prevention planning group.
He said that most men do not engage in unprotected anal
intercourse, are reducing the risk if they do, and have fewer sex
partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that prevention is working,'' said Mayne, who led the
survey with Richard Elovich, who heads HIV prevention for GMHC.
Mayne added: ``HIV prevalence is decreasing in New York City, no
question. We have cut the rate at least in half.''
</P>
<P>
   With its broad reach and explicit detail, the survey helps fill
a ``shocking and irresponsible'' void in research on the New York
City epidemic, said Dr. Ron Stall, an AIDS epidemiologist at the
University of California at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Elovich said ``we were working without maps'' to guide
prevention efforts. New York City's gay populations are more
diverse than other cities, and many important decisions about
prevention have been based on information collected in other cities
and not applicable to New York City, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the new survey was not representative of all men who
have sex with men in New York City and reflected only what the men
said about themselves, it showed that more extensive efforts are
needed, particularly among black and Hispanic gay men, to prevent
them from becoming infected with HIV. The survey found that black
and Hispanic gay men were less likely to engage in risk reduction.
They were also twice as likely as white gay men to get their HIV
test in a hospital, usually when sick with AIDS, instead of at a
clinic when feeling well.
</P>
<P>
   The number of black, Hispanic, Asian and Pacific Islander gay
men in the New York City survey was larger than in any other study
specifically aimed at these groups, Mayne said.
</P>
<P>
   Guided by the survey results, the GMHC, with financing from the
health department, began posting public service notices in subways
last week aimed at black mothers and their sons and daughters and
distributing cards with similar messages. In a campaign timed for
Gay Pride month, GMHC is offering free tests to encourage more
blacks to know their infection status.
</P>
<P>
   The organization is seeking money to conduct a similar campaign
in Spanish to reach Hispanic gay men, Elovich said.
</P>
<P>
   With no way to know the exact number of gay men living in New
York City, health officials can only estimate it at 370,000, based
on calculations that 10 percent of the population is gay.
Scientists have been hampered in conducting the standard type of
random surveys. Of hundreds of studies done since the start of
AIDS, only one, a national telephone survey conducted by Stall's
team at the University of California at San Francisco, has used
methods thought to give a random sample of gay men, Mayne said.
</P>
<P>
   The New York researchers' confidence in their findings has been
buoyed by a forthcoming report by the San Francisco team.
</P>
<P>
   Stall said that he would soon publish findings from a national
study done by a different method from the New York City study and
that showed almost precisely the same one in seven rate of HIV
infection in gay men in New York City. Since the AIDS epidemic was
first recognized in 1981, more than 40,000 gay men have died from
the disease in New York City and San Francisco. But the deaths
account for only a small proportion of the drop in the percentage
of HIV-infected men in the two cities.
</P>
<P>
   The same halving of infection rates has occurred in San
Francisco, Stall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big deal, extremely good news,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City survey was patterned after one conducted
earlier in London by a group known as Sigma Research. Because the
New York City researchers did not choose the participants randomly,
they could not estimate the degree of sampling error, as is done in
polling.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers wearing T-shirts identifying them as GMHC survey
workers went on different days to 23 places where gay men
congregate, including beaches, bars, bath houses, parties and
street corners. The men were asked to answer 20 explicit questions
about their health and sexual practices, and put the completed
questionnaire in a sealed box. Of the men approached, more than 90
percent returned the questionnaires.
</P>
<P>
   GMHC instructed the volunteers about how to approach the men and
the importance of confidentiality. The volunteers would clarify the
meaning of questions for the participants, but otherwise did not
discuss the answers with them. Volunteers were matched to the
participants. ``It was a young black man asking another young black
man to fill this out,'' Elovich said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayne said that the anonymous and confidential nature of the New
York City survey was intended to encourage honest answers.
</P>
<P>
   The study counters, in part, recent studies and news reports
suggesting that more young gay men were having unprotected anal
intercourse. While some men are having unsafe sex, the New York
City survey found, many of these men are playing ``mental
calculus'' in deciding when not to use condoms, Elovich said.
</P>
<P>
   Many studies have shown that the receptive anal partner has a
greater risk of getting HIV. There was ``a common myth that men
tend to prefer one role, insertive or receptive, either tops or
bottoms,'' Mayne said, but half the men in the survey said they
played both roles, often based on knowledge or perception of the
partner's HIV status.
</P>
<P>
   In the year before the survey, about one in 10 gay men engaged
in unsafe anal intercourse, which the New York City team defined as
not using condoms during anal sex with someone of unknown or a
different HIV status. About two-thirds of those who did not use
condoms reported doing so with only one partner. Also, in
two-thirds of cases, both partners were believed to have the same
HIV test results. When anal sex was riskiest, uninfected men said
they stayed on top more often, and infected men stayed on the
bottom more often.

 NEW YORK: more often. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In teaming up, the health department and GMHC stepped into a
void left by academia. The federal National Institutes of Health
has paid for an ongoing national survey that began in the
mid-1980s. But it did not include New York City because ``no New
York researcher applied for it,'' Mayne said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in the AIDS epidemic, New York City did some of the
finest research on gay men, and then for some reason the efforts
were not sustained,'' Mayne said. For example, he said, San
Francisco conducted a survey of young gay men six years before it
was done in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance accomplished what would have cost an estimated
$250,000 if done under a federal grant. GMHC and the health
department did not have such sums available, Elovich and Mayne
said.
</P>
<P>
   So Elovich's team used existing staff and financing and
continued GMHC's tradition of relying on volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Stall said the ``survey was a very good use of scarce public
health monies.''
</P>
<P>
   Elovich said his team also recognized that ``if we were to make
prevention work to keep people uninfected in this city, we needed
to get a younger generation of gay men invested the way an older
generation had been.''
</P>
<P>
   When GMHC started the survey, Elovich said, ``we thought we
would get 2,000 men, but we passed every benchmark that we had set
up.''
</P>
<P>
   They focused on places where they would find large numbers of
gay men, like Fire Island and the corner of Christopher Street and
Seventh Avenue in Manhattan. The aim was to find the men where they
were not intending to talk about sexually transmitted diseases, HIV
testing, sexual practices or their alcohol and drug use, Elovich
said.
</P>
<P>
   No questions were asked about oral sex because the risk, though
real, is much less than from anal intercourse, Mayne said.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers hope to compare the 1998 survey with information
from additional surveys being conducted this year and planned for
2000. New questions are being asked to learn how gay men determine
that their partner is HIV-negative and to plan further prevention
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its effort to get more blacks and more young gay men
in this year's survey, GMHC offered to pay the admission fee to a
large ball at Roseland in exchange for filling out the
questionnaire. ``Over 1,500 black kids did,'' Elovich said, ``and
we would not reach them any other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Elovich said the next survey would further refine questions
about how men make their sexual choices. ``We are asking more
questions about disclosure in the new questionnaire,'' he said.
``What does knowing mean? How do people make their decisions? What
do they know about their partner when they make these decisions?
What are they communicating?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult for major federal funding agencies to believe
that a community-based organization could do something on this
scale,'' Elovich said. ``But what we have done here proves it can
be done, it demonstrates the power of community based research and
it shows that there really is no such thing as a population that is
too difficult to reach.''
</P>
<P>
   Copies of the survey can be obtained free from GMHC, HIV
Prevention, 119 West 24th St., New York 10011.

FERNANDO'S NO-NO IN 1990 ONLY SECOND ONE OF THE DAY
</HEADLINE>

   LOS ANGELES _ As the year 2000 approaches, here's a look at some
of the interesting anniversaries that will occur this week in Los
Angeles sports history (followed by the ranking of the event from
the book ``Unforgettable: The 100 Greatest Moments in Los Angeles
Sports History'' in parenthesis, where applicable):
</P>
<P>
   June 28, 1969: Don Drysdale, who would retire less than two
months later, is credited for the win in the Dodgers' 19-0 victory
over San Diego _ the most lopsided shutout in NL history.
</P>
<P>
   June 29, 1956: During the U.S. Olympic team track and field
trials at the Coliseum, 19-year-old Charlie Dumas of USC is the
first American to break the 7-foot barrier in the high jump, going
over at 7-|. Later that year, he won the gold at the Melbourne
Olympics. (84)
</P>
<P>
   June 29, 1990: Dodgers left-hander Fernando Valenzuela throws a
6-0 no-hitter against St. Louis at Dodger Stadium. With former
Dodger Dave Stewart's no-hitter for Oakland against Toronto earlier
in the day, it's the first time since 1917 that two pitchers throw
complete-game no-nos on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   June 30, 1962: Dodgers left-hander Sandy Koufax throws his first
no-hitter, a 5-0 win against the expansion New York Mets. He
strikes out 13 and walks five. He also strikes out the first three
batters on nine pitches.
</P>
<P>
   June 30, 1984: The USFL's Los Angeles Express plays in the
longest game in pro football history _ 93 minutes, 33 seconds _
defeating the Michigan Panthers in three overtimes 27-21 in a
playoff game at the Coliseum. The reason it goes so long _ Panthers
kicker Novo Bojovic misses three field-goal tries in the OT.
Express running back Kevin Mack's touchdown run ends it as he
breaks his arm in the end zone scoring it.
</P>
<P>
   July 4, 1910: Los Angeles heavyweight Jim Jeffries comes out of
a six-year retirement to reclaim his title against Jack Johnson in
Reno, but he is no match for the reigning champ, losing a 15-round
classic battle. Jeffries moved to Burbank and died at age 77 in
1953.
</P>
<P>
   July 4, 1912: Los Angeles-born boxer Joe Rivers, fighting at the
Southland's top stadium of the day, Vernon Arena, meets Ad Wolgast
in a scheduled 20-round fight for Wolgast's lightweight world
championship. No one knows who won. It goes down in the record
books as the only double knockout fight in history as both landed
KO blows simultaneously in the 13th round.
</P>
<P>
   July 4, 1959: The Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena is dedicated
by Vice President Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   July 4, 1962: The Angels, in just their second season, sweep a
doubleheader from the Washington Senators to go into first place in
the American League standings.
</P>
<P>
   Birthdays: Today: Former Granada Hills High football star John
Elway (39) and former Angels star Don Baylor (50). Wednesday:
Angels outfielder and former Kennedy High star Garret Anderson
(27), Dodgers shortstop Mark Grudzielanek (29) and Dodgers pitcher
Chan Ho Park (26). Saturday: Former Angels pitcher Frank Tanana
(46) and Mighty Ducks winger Teemu Selanne (29). Sunday:
Carpetbagger Al Davis (70).

`BOONDOCKS' CREATOR HAS MANY PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT COMIC STRIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT L. JAMIESON JR.  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ You are bright-eyed and 24.
</P>
<P>
   You sketch a comic strip that features hip, at times flip, black
kids.
</P>
<P>
   You watch as readers rave, then rant, then _ uh oh! _ rant some
more.
</P>
<P>
   You hold your breath.
</P>
<P>
   Some people call your strip humorous and fun, and praise its
cutting-edge coolness. Others say it is ugly, divisive, offensive,
witless, racist and bad. ``This thing is worthless!'' one adult
reader in Seattle growls.
</P>
<P>
   You now have a hint of how it feels to walk in Aaron McGruder's
shoes. The brainy and unflappable creator of ``The Boondocks,'' a
new nationally syndicated comic strip, has folks buzzing from
Atlanta and Chicago to Washington, D.C., and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   McGruder's comic strip was first published this spring in dozens
of U.S. newspapers, including the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, and
is now carried in more than 180 papers. Whether it is clever
commentary or self-indulgent drivel is an argument playing out in
several arenas, from letters to the editor, to phone calls from
readers, to huddles in office gathering spots.
</P>
<P>
   Post-Intelligencer Managing Editor Ken Bunting says the
newspaper has had ``lots of negative feedback from readers'' since
the strip began. He and other P-I editors are watching carefully as
the strip and its story line develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obvious that Aaron is a real talent, with a fresh,
unique approach that has an edge,'' Bunting says. ``The question
for me will be whether he can touch on topics like race, class and
human relations in a manner that is funny and provocative, without
also being so offensive to so many readers. I don't have my
definitive answer yet.''
</P>
<P>
   But amid the controversy, one thing is clear: At an age when
many artists are lucky to get any audience for their work,
McGruder, one of just a handful of black syndicated comic-strip
artists, is breaking ground _ and striking a nerve in the papers
that venture into ``The Boondocks.''
</P>
<P>
   His distinctive drawing style delivers edgy figures with sweet _
if not always smiling _ faces. Overall, he says his work gives
voice to a slice of life that gets little ink in the conservative
arena of the funny pages: the suburban experience of young blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Few comic strips, for example, would dare get tangled up in the
politics of black hair or have a black character make random
traffic stops of white motorists as part of ``Operation
Klanwatch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What the strip is ultimately about is who we are as black
people, what it means to be black and black self-identity,''
McGruder says, his voice competing with a blaring television.
``It's a racial satire. A social satire. Sometimes a political
satire.''
</P>
<P>
   He quips, ``It's definitely not `The Cosby Show.'''
</P>
<P>
   The strip focuses on four inner-city kids _ three black boys and
one biracial girl _ who are negotiating the unpredictable terrain
of a predominantly white and suburban world.
</P>
<P>
   Let's meet them:
</P>
<P>
   Huey R. Freeman, the protagonist, is a black nationalist who
believes that he is ``blacker than Richard Roundtree,'' the actor
who immortalized ``hood hipness'' in the 1970s ``Shaft'' movies.
Huey is pretentious, but has a kind heart. (McGruder says he would
be most like Huey if he were a kid.)
</P>
<P>
   Riley, Huey's younger brother, wears a deep scowl and is a
``gangsta'' wannabe. Caesar, Huey's best friend, is fun-loving and
totes a microphone. Jazmine, a young biracial neighbor, is
struggling with her racial identity.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the strip's humor is generated from how the characters
balance issues of racial politics, self-pride, youth and current
events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not see much point in doing the thing some black artists
usually do,'' McGruder says, ``by coming out and saying `I'm not a
black artist, I'm just an artist.' I think that is kind of silly.
So I am unapologetically black. I do a black strip.''
</P>
<P>
   McGruder believes some black artists duck black themes because
they fear they won't attain mainstream success.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I have never seen pop culture working that way,'' he says.
``I think that white people who want to buy into black culture
would rather buy into something that's authentic rather than
something that is watered down for their sake.''
</P>
<P>
   Many P-I readers have not been amused; 31 out of 33 local
readers who have contacted the paper's reader representative line
about ``The Boondocks'' have expressed anger. (The Los Angeles
Times received about 100 letters of complaint through early June.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would I want to read about angry, bitter, racist
characters?'' one Seattle reader asked.
</P>
<P>
   Another caller fumed: ``This is probably the most disgusting
example of an excuse of a cartoon that I have ever seen in my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   One reader called Huey ``an obnoxious little twit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It perpetuates bad stereotypes and there is certainly nothing
funny about it,'' says Karen Ahern, co-chairwoman of the Bainbridge
Unity Coalition, a community group that fights intolerance on
Bainbridge Island, near Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``My 9-year-old daughter, Mariah, thought it was just a really
bad example of African American behavior.'' Ahern adds, ``The
cartoon has mellowed out lately.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Salem, the editorial director of Universal Press Syndicate,
which picked up ``The Boondocks'' after discovering McGruder two
years ago, says the syndicate was attracted to ``a singular form of
humor and writing we haven't seen. We wanted to take the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, McGruder's work does not sit on the page, it leaps off
it.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of his work dwells on race.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent strip, one of the characters compares the random
killing of insects to the arbitrary nature of U.S. foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Neither McGruder nor executives at the syndicate, however,
anticipated the public fallout from the June 4 ``Boondocks'' strip.
</P>
<P>
   In it, a demure white girl is knocked down when Riley hits her
on the head with a toy light saber. Looming over her, Riley huffs,
``See?! You're still alive! This thing is worthless!''
</P>
<P>
   The public reaction was swift.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is too violent and it's not helping the relations between
blacks and whites,'' slammed Seattle-area resident Jan Rios.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ride public transportation and I hear kids in the bus saying
I think (this strip) is bad stuff,'' another P-I reader criticized.
</P>
<P>
   One man says: ```Boondocks' ... seems not so much a comic strip
as a promotion of hostility and confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   McGruder has been flummoxed by the reaction. The young
cartoonist, who counts ``Bloom County'' and ``Calvin and Hobbes''
as his primary comic-strip influences, just wanted to show Riley
``being a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no clue that it was going to be a problem for
anybody,'' he says. ``The light saber week has been by far the most
controversial of the strips. ... I was dumbfounded.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses and gathers his thoughts. ``I intended (the light
saber strip) to be some very simple Calvin-and-Hobbes-type
childhood mischief thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he says the strip became a litmus test for what he
calls a ``huge double standard'' in how America views depictions of
white violence vs. those of black violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calvin and Hobbes was an extraordinarily violent strip.
There's strips where Calvin is trying to get explosives. ...
Calvin's blowing up his elementary school. ... These were things
that were done quite some time ago, which lead me to believe that a
toy light saber was not going to be that big of a deal,'' McGruder
says with a sigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently I was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   John Lindsay, managing editor for features at the Los Angeles
Times, found it interesting that people accepted Calvin as violent
and mean, but seem to be less willing to embrace a Huey.
</P>
<P>
   The recent school shootings at Colorado's Columbine High School
has diminished the tolerance readers have for portrayals of
violence in the media.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the history of comics is spiced with less than savory
characters. Dick Tracy offended readers with its political views
and violence; Andy Capp was blasted by female readers for being an
alcoholic and abusive to his wife. Yet both of those strips
entertained _ or peeved _ people for years.
</P>
<P>
   McGruder says he is still growing into his strip. Salem says
reader reactions to ``The Boondocks'' _ pro and con _ are ``good
for newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   And the strip has die-hard fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me think,'' one e-mailer wrote the L.A. Times.
</P>
<P>
   Another person told that newspaper: ``It makes us take a look at
the whole stupidly ridiculous way we view race here in America. ...
It does my head and heart good to have (my stereotypes) put in the
spotlight and laughed about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the strip. I think it is a good strip,'' said David
Zeeck, executive editor of The News Tribune in Tacoma, which
started ``The Boondocks'' on June 2.
</P>
<P>
   Zeeck said early reaction was largely negative. But after the
paper published negative letters, several readers came out of the
woodwork with letters of support for the strip.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks some parents view the comics page as being for
light-hearted, fun topics, not as a forum to deal with prickly
racial issues. ``And Huey's a hard case,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Some newspapers have considered moving the strip away from the
funny pages, to the classified section or perhaps the editorial
pages.
</P>
<P>
   McGruder is taking the attention in stride. Just two years ago,
he was a fresh-faced kid out of the University of Maryland, where
he started the strip for a campus publication.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he lives at home with his parents in suburban Maryland,
and doodles in his bedroom, which has ``Star Wars'' bedsheets.
</P>
<P>
   But life is changing at light-speed. Two weeks ago, he got his
first paycheck from the syndicate _ a sign that perhaps he soon
will be moving into a a galaxy all his own, away from mom and pop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's Porsche pay,'' he says with a chuckle.
``Miata pay might be a better way to describe it.''

CHANGE IN INTERNET NAME REGISTRATION IS DELAYED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)  (lb) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The protracted effort to introduce competition into
the lucrative business of registering Internet addresses has been
delayed for at least three weeks because of escalating tensions
among the Clinton administration, its handpicked successor for
running the global network and the government contractor that has
had a monopoly on the business.
</P>
<P>
   The delay is just the latest sign that the debate on the issue _
which has previously been confined largely to Internet insiders _
is quickly turning into a high-profile, high-stakes political game
of chicken, the results of which could lead to a dangerous tug of
war over what is essentially the Internet's telephone directory.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute centers on the move to break up Network Solutions
Inc.'s hold on the business of registering the so-called domain
names that people use as Internet addresses in the popular
directories of .com, .net and .org. The company has had the
exclusive worldwide right since 1993 to assign Internet addresses
that end in any of those three-letter suffixes.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in what was to be the final step in a decade-long
process of transferring control of the Internet to the private
sector, the Commerce Department created the Internet Corp. for
Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN, to oversee the network.
</P>
<P>
   ICANN's charge was to open up the registration of Internet
addresses to competition. But the creation of ICANN and just about
everything its interim board has proposed have stirred opposition
and controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The latest delay comes on the heels of a letter-writing campaign
by Ralph Nader and tax watchdog groups and an inquiry from the
chairman of the powerful House Commerce Committee, Rep. Thomas
Bliley, R-Va., questioning the actions and the authority of the
Commerce Department and ICANN. The potential fallout of the dispute
threatens both the centralized structure of the Internet and the
ability of ICANN to carry out its task.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great political theater,'' Michael Roberts, the interim
president of ICANN, said of the intense lobbying from both sides
that has moved to Capitol Hill and high levels of the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said discussions about the dispute and its potential
effect on how the Internet operates have reached both the Pentagon
and the president's Critical Infrastructure Assurance Office.
</P>
<P>
   Those questioning ICANN say they are concerned that the interim
board is overstepping its authority. They have seized on the
board's refusal to hold open board meetings and its decision to
impose a $1-a-year fee on every domain name registered.
</P>
<P>
   Bliley sent blistering letters to Commerce Secretary William
Daley and to Esther Dyson, the interim chairwoman of ICANN, on
Tuesday. That was the same day a special congressional commission,
headed by Gov. James Gilmore of Virginia, convened its first
meeting on Internet tax policy in Williamsburg, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Bliley's accompanying news release offered a preview of the
potential political fallout that some fear could find its way into
the campaigns against Vice President Al Gore, who has positioned
himself as a champion of a tax-free, unregulated Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't this ironic,'' Bliley said, ``just as Gov. Gilmore is
working hard with the Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce to
encourage the growth of electronic commerce, ICANN is imposing a
tax on the Internet behind closed doors.''
</P>
<P>
   Bliley's letters ask for records and information about the
process used to select ICANN's interim board members and set its
$5.9 million budget, as well any analysis of its legal authority to
levy the $1 fee. The letters also seek information about statements
that ICANN officials made threatening to terminate the authority of
Network Solutions, a Virginia company, to register new Internet
addresses during its last meeting, in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   After that threat, Network Solutions began a full-scale lobbying
effort in Washington, seeking an investigation of ICANN. ICANN,
meanwhile, has accused the company of ``funding and otherwise''
fostering much of the criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Although ICANN has since acknowledged that only the Commerce
Department has the authority to cut off Network Solutions' right to
register domain names, the company is also deadlocked with Commerce
officials over crucial details for opening its registry to
full-scale competition.
</P>
<P>
   One of five companies picked in April for the first round of
competition with Network Solutions, Register.com, has been
successfully registering names for several weeks. And ICANN and the
Commerce Department had hoped to open the system to more companies
on Friday. Instead, they announced the three-week delay, and people
close to the process said that they expected it to drag on even
longer.
</P>
<P>
   Besides making sure that the technical bugs can be worked out to
ensure that the $20 million system that Network Solutions built
will run smoothly when multiple competitors come online, the two
sides remain deadlocked on key issues that were supposed to have
been ironed out months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The major question is who has rights to the Network Solutions
database that holds the information about who owns the more than 5
million registered domain names.
</P>
<P>
   They are also wrangling over how much the companies entering the
business will have to pay Network Solutions to administer the
central registry. Network Solutions also must reach an agreement on
terms under which it will recognize ICANN's authority. Network
Solutions has refused to sign the contract ICANN has developed,
saying it is overly restrictive and gives ICANN more power than the
administration intended when it drafted its plan for handing
Internet oversight to the private, nonprofit body.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, meanwhile, insists that if Network Solutions refuses to
compromise, the Commerce Department and ICANN could find another
company to take over administration of .com, .net and .org. But
that could not be done quickly or easily and would likely cause
some disruptions for Internet users and electronic commerce.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Such a scenario could also force a split in the root of the
Internet, which is essentially the phone book of the Internet.
Roberts said ICANN was preparing to move the main root server for
the network from Network Solutions' headquarters in Herndon, Va.,
to California.
</P>
<P>
   But unless Network Solutions agrees to hand over the
corresponding data for that root, it might not immediately be able
to find all of the names that Network Solutions has registered.
That could create chaos on the Internet because computer users or
their Internet service providers would have to know the so-called
IP address of any site they wanted to visit or send e-mail to _ for
example, 204.177.154.13 instead of www.amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Network Solutions, meanwhile, could continue running its own
root server, meaning that Internet service providers would have to
either choose between the roots, set up their systems to recognize
both or create their own roots.
</P>
<P>
   Becky Burr, a senior Commerce Department aide leading the
negotiations, said she remained optimistic that the problems would
be resolved without such drastic measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that we'll get there,'' she said on Friday. ``I
believe it is in everybody's best interest not to swing threats
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are not so sure. A group of Internet technical experts
has begun talking about what the Internet might look like without a
central root system _ and without ICANN.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Auerbach, a video network developer for Cisco Systems Inc.
who has been involved in the Internet's engineering task force for
years, says he does not think a split root would be such a bad
thing. He said a split would essentially force Internet service
providers to create a competing list of directories, much as
telephone companies do.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would result is that each of the root systems would try
to be more inclusive than its neighbors, and the net result would
be that they all end up being essentially the same as everybody,''
he said. ``The number to Fred's Barber Shop would still be the
number to Fred's Barber Shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a system, he said, could also allow Internet service to
cater to certain cultural or age groups, meaning they could set
their directories to keep their customers' Web browsers from
reaching certain sites that they might find offensive.

FRONTLINE SHOW ON WORKINGS OF IMF IS UNSETTLING, FRIGHTENING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Need a good scare? Don't wait for Jan de Bont's remake of ``The
Haunting'' next month. Just watch ``Frontline'' on Tuesday night.
If it doesn't make you start hoarding quarters, you've got what it
takes to be a global capitalist.
</P>
<P>
   Me? I'll be busy with the travel brochures and Heloise's hints
on stowing away aboard Boeing jets. There must be someplace in the
world where the International Monetary Fund isn't welcome.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF is easily the bete noire in this ``Frontline'' piece,
airing on PBS. Described dispassionately as ``a kind of credit
union for countries in crisis,'' it also is characterized more
pointedly as ``the Typhoid Mary of emerging markets.''
</P>
<P>
   That last remark is from Harvard economist Jeffrey Sachs, a
critic of economic policies promoted by the U.S. Treasury and the
IMF. Sachs and others believe big-time investors no longer fear
losing their shirts in high-risk overseas ventures because they
figure the IMF will always bail out troubled economies and keep
high-rollers' shirts in place. This decade, the IMF has done
exactly that when the economies of Mexico, Asia, Russia and Brazil
got stuck in the toaster.
</P>
<P>
   In examining the rickety underpinnings of the new global economy
that many Americans hail as the slickest thing since pay-per-view,
``Frontline'' wonders if there's a big economic crash in our own
future.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Tuesday's program is titled ``The Crash'' because it
harks back to last Aug. 31, when the Dow Jones industrial average
dropped 512 points and had a lot of investors wondering if it was
time to do the Kevorkian. Of course, the Dow has risen an
incredible 40 percent since then. Three thousand points in 10
months! But what our 401(k) statements don't show is that 40
percent of the world is in a recession, and millions of poor people
who became middle class during the ``tiger economies'' of the early
'90s are poor again. Not the big-time investors, mind you, but the
people who live in the countries where the economies went south
after tying their fortunes to the dollar and opening themselves up
to a flood of speculative foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
   For people not versed in the everyday jargon of arbitrage,
producer Sherry Jones does a splendid job of making a point that's
easy to miss when the paper money is rolling in. Here's how Robert
Johnson, a former portfolio manager for Soros Fund Management, puts
it: ``Our stock market's at an all-time high. (But) it's a little
bit like fiddling while Rome burns, because the world is struggling
all around us.''
</P>
<P>
   With due diligence, Tuesday's ``Frontline'' lets the IMF have
its say _ the official line is that the world crisis is not as bad
as advertised _ but, in typical ``Frontline'' style, the message of
``The Crash'' remains clear and well-stated: Don't get greedy.
</P>
<P>
   Odds 'n' ends
</P>
<P>
   After three years at Fox News Channel, Catherine Crier is
leaving for Court TV to tap into her training as a lawyer. Paula
Zahn, who anchors Fox's evening newscast, will also host a new
prime-time program in place of ``The Crier Report,'' which airs at
7 p.m. and midnight in the West. ... Though The WB has scheduled
the postponed season finale of ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' for
July 13, the fate of another pulled episode, originally scheduled
for April 27, is still up in the air.

   LOS ANGELES _ Stuff that'll continue to amaze you and maybe even
your friends pulled from the pages of a book called Ultimate Sports
Lists (DK Publishing, by Mike Meserole, $17.95, 224 pgs):
</P>
<P>
   __The Lakers won five NBA titles in the 1980s, but actually
finished second to Boston in regular-season victories that decade.
OK, so it was only by one, 592 to 591.
</P>
<P>
   __During the '70s, the Pittsburgh Steelers (99-44-1) won four
Super Bowls, but the Los Angeles Rams (98-42-4) had a better record
in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   __When the Seattle Mariners move from the cavernous Kingdome to
Safeco Field in two weeks, Dodger Stadium will be the fifth-largest
major-league baseball park, with a 56,000 capacity.
</P>
<P>
   __Maury Wills' record 104 stolen bases with the Dodgers in 1962
now stands at only No. 7 all-time.
</P>
<P>
   __The Dodgers are the only major-league baseball team of the
'90s to finish in the top 10 in wins (No. 5 with 720, tied with
Boston) but have no postseason victories in the decade.
</P>
<P>
   __Of the top-grossing contemporary sports movies, Adam Sandler's
``The Waterboy'' ranks second (behind ``Jerry Maguire'') and ahead
of all four ``Rocky'' movies.
</P>
<P>
   __After Michael Jordan (46) and Muhammad Ali (35), the next two
athletes most frequently seen on the cover of Sports Illustrated
are Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (28) and Magic Johnson (24).
</P>
<P>
   __The NHL single-game record for most penalty minutes assessed
to one player is 67 by the Kings' Randy Holt against the
Philadelphia Flyers in 1979. No.2 on the list with 55 is the
Flyers' Frank Bathe. In the same game, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Both were given three majors and two 10-minute misconducts, but
Holt received one more game misconduct (three, to Bathe's two),
plus one minor penalty to beat him to the punch. And to the top of
the list.

COMPUTER BRIEFS: A $199 COMPUTER; THE WHOOPS FACTOR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Computer companies have long promised that computers would
someday be as easy to use as ordinary kitchen appliances, but so
far they have failed to deliver anything close.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, Microworkz.com, a maker of low-price PCs in
Seattle, introduced a computer it contends is as easy to use as a
toaster oven and aptly named it the iToaster.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the device different is that it does not use Windows.
Instead, its operating system is a hybrid of Linux, the popular
public domain operating system, and the BeOS, an operating system
created by a former Apple executive.
</P>
<P>
   The result, says Rick Latman, chief executive of Microworkz, is
a combination word-processing, home-finance and Web-browsing
machine that has a graphic interface like Windows but is far
simpler to use.
</P>
<P>
   It does not replace a Windows machine, Latman said. It is for
people who cannot or do not want to use a personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   At $199, it is also considerably cheaper than most Windows
machines except for Microworkz's own Webzter Jr. PC, which is
priced at $299.
</P>
<P>
   Latman said 10,000 iToasters would be available for purchase
directly from Microworkz.com beginning on July 15, and they will be
in retail stores by the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the iToaster cannot run standard software, nor can it
do complex computations.
</P>
<P>
   For those reasons alone it may not find the ready audience that
Latman expects. It can, however, print to any Hewlett-Packard or
Epson Stylus printer, and it has a detached keyboard for word
processing, features which certainly improve its chances.
</P>
<P>
   Latman, who has sold tens of thousands Webzter Jr. machines and
is already taking orders for iToasters, envisions homes with an
iToaster in every room.
</P>
<P>
   To lift sales even before the selling has started, the company
is offering a discount: Starting this week, customers can pay
$19.95 a month for 24 months for a subscription to Microworkz's
Internet service and receive the iToaster free.

   ELIMINATING DATA FILES IS COSTLY FOR BUSINESSES
</P>
<P>
   Despite the havoc the Explore.exe and Melissa viruses have
wreaked on businesses over the last few months, a new survey shows
that there is a far bigger threat to data security lurking in
corporate America: You.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasters Network International, a market research company,
said that the biggest threat to data security was, by far, computer
users accidentally deleting files. Call it the whoops factor.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of 300 system managers released last week said
accidental deletions cause 30 times the data loss that viruses do.
</P>
<P>
   The survey said, much of the problem could be attributed to
ignorance: Many users are ill-informed about just how easy it is to
inadvertently delete a file or a set of files on a server.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is that while nearly every computer has antivirus
software, few computers have protection to recover deleted files.
Losing data between backups is a huge fear among 54 percent of
system managers surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   Daily backup, the most commonly used safeguard against data
loss, often fails entirely, leaving system managers without the
protection they thought they had.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter of respondents said that backup device failure, along
with human error, makes backing up unreliable. Many times
individual computers are left out of backup schedules altogether.
</P>
<P>
   If the survey's dire revelations are true, corporations could be
losing more money in lost data than they previously thought, having
turned most of the attention to the threat of viruses.
</P>
<P>
   While estimates vary, some experts believe viruses cause more
than $500 million annually. (Melissa, which infected 19 percent of
the nation's large corporations, was responsible for nearly $300
million in data loss, according to the computer security company
ICSA.net.) That means accidental deletions could be causing U.S.
corporations $15 billion a year. &QL;

MINI-REVIEWS OF SHAKESPEARE PRODUCTIONS AT ASHLAND FESTIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOE ADCOCK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ Henry IV, Part Two. To emphasize the boys-will-be-boys nature
of this political and military action/adventure story, ``Henry IV,
Part Two,'' director Libby Appel uses an all-male cast.
</P>
<P>
   As with any might-makes-right drama in which authority, majesty
and venal institutions are glorified, ``Henry IV, Part Two'' is
hard to take at times. But Appel's casting experiment certainly
pays off. The feats of virtuoso acting are fun to watch. Dan
Donohue, for example, is boyish and then manly as England's royal
prince. Donohue also plays the lowly clowns Wart and Fang. Even
better, G. Valmont Thomas plays both the doughty rebel knight
Colville and the ludicrous innkeeper Mistress Quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Also funny and outrageous is Ken Albers as the parasitical and
opportunistic Sir John Falstaff. Albers starts buoyant and
dissolute. Over the course of the play's nearly three hours, he
steadily declines into demoralized exhaustion. Falstaff is a
barometer of ``Henry IV, Part Two's'' political climate. He blooms
in the early atmosphere of cozy chaos. He withers when
law-and-order comes into its own.
</P>
<P>
   _ Othello. The rap on this bizarre tragedy is that it is
preposterous and unbelievable. The title character is brilliant but
stupid. The villain, Iago, is driven. He's a fiend. But it's hard
to comprehend what it could possibly be that is driving such
outrageous fiendishness. That's all on the level of sociological
reality.
</P>
<P>
   Director Tony Taccone is not concerned with sociological reality
in this brilliant, stirring production. His ``Othello'' looks and
sounds like a powerful ritual. It moves on the level of emotional
and spiritual realities.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of candles loom in the background during the killing
scene, making death seem like a religious sacrifice. A
nowhere/anywhere world of Venetian blind slats creates a scene of
spying, hiding and hampered perception. Music suggests a pounding
heart, occasionally disrupted by shattering dissonances. The
characters wear costumes that are part long ago and far away and
part here and now.
</P>
<P>
   In this irrational but compelling world, Othello and Iago and
their many unfortunate cohorts are comprehensible. As Othello,
Derrick Lee Weeden is a cunning soldier, professionally, and a
befuddled innocent, romantically. His beloved Desdemona as played
by Amy Cronies is enough of a flirt and a sexual manipulator to
make Iago's accusations of infidelity a little plausible. Anthony
Heald, as Iago, is one of those borderline personalities we all
meet from time to time: glib and desperate, halting and inventive,
absurd and yet somehow convincing. He's delusional, paranoid and
compulsive.
</P>
<P>
   As Cassio, the lieutenant who has supposedly, according to
Iago's allegations, seduced Desdemona, Andrew Borba is unusually
interesting in a role that can come off as no more than a plot
device. Fight choreographer John Sipes does a fantastic job with
the crazed brawl that Cassio sets off in his alcoholic fury.
</P>
<P>
   Taccone's presentation of infatuation and dishonesty, passion
and madness, give the bizarre incidents of ``Othello'' the look of
things that, alas, happen every day.
</P>
<P>
   _ Much Ado About Nothing. This dark comedy has an all-out
villain, but Don John is merely a plot device. He helps to weave a
background fabric. The fabric serves one purpose: it gives the
celebrated Beatrice and Benedick a foundation on which to work out
their intricate needlepoint of wit and love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much Ado'' holds the world record for eavesdropping and
deception. Two ninnies, Hero and Claudio, mean to marry. The
nefarious Don John slanders Hero. Claudio backs out of the
marriage. Through the good offices of a team of clown constables,
the baselessness of the libel comes to light. So the ninnies marry
after all.
</P>
<P>
   But that background is mostly stage dressing for the Beatrice
and Benedick show. Elizabeth Norment and Mark Murphy make an
unusually nuanced B and B. Their put-down humor is funny. But it
has a certain awkwardness; it has the poignancy of unduly prolonged
adolescence. Pride takes a beating if a person is playing catch-up
in the game of romance. Norment and Murphy are good with that agony
and urgency.
</P>
<P>
   Director James Edmondson has worked out ample visual humor. He
emphasizes the comic aspect of this dark comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Edmondson has chosen to set this ``Much Ado'' in early
20th-century Argentina. Lots of military braggadoccio. Lots of
preening machismo. Lots of punctilio about virginity and such. And,
best of all, the Argentine milieu provides a pretext for a flashy
tango finale.
</P>
<P>
   Other shows
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Seven Guitars'' by August Wilson. This tragedy is set in
Pittsburgh's black ghetto in 1948. The seven guitars referred to in
the title are actually four men and three women. Like members of a
jazz ensemble, each player has a particular temperament and tone, a
characteristic tempo and volume. Each has his or her characteristic
riffs. Each tells stories that define individual and collective
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   And like any blues tune, ``Seven Guitars'' is never exactly the
same piece twice. Director Benny Leon's version is both livelier
and quieter than what we've grown used to in Seattle from Wilson's
preferred director, Lloyd Richards. When the characters are rowdy,
they really bounce and whoop. When they are meditative, the theater
becomes as still as a Zen temple. And when anger flashes, it looks
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The personification of anger and danger is Derrick Lee Weeden as
a West Indian immigrant, Hedley, who has been driven half-mad by
degradation and disappointment. As Hedley, Weeden conveys delusions
of grandeur as skillfully as he portrays Othello's crazed loss of
grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   Leon draws out high definition, high-energy characterizations
from his whole ensemble: G. Valmont Thomas as a bouncy drummer,
Kevin Kenerly as a quirky harmonica man; Ken LaRon as a passionate
and desperate singer/guitarist; Susan Champion as a young woman who
has ``a certain effect on men''; Andrea Frye as a brassy beautician
who is wised-up and sassy; and Deidrie Henry as a mature woman torn
between desire and fear, hope and despair.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Rosmersholm'' by Henrik Ibsen. According to that pioneering
drama critic Aristotle, an effective tragedy ``purges'' us.
Different tragedies purge different things for different people at
different times.
</P>
<P>
   For me, just now, the excellent festival production of Ibsen's
1886 tragedy ``Rosmersholm'' helps purge all that Monica
Lewinsky/Whitewater/Ken Starr stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Ibsen's protagonist is an ineffectual but prominent man. He has
vague ideals. He talks a lot. He accomplishes little. Along comes
an irresistible young woman. Trouble. Along comes an
arch-conservative, prurient, nosy self-appointed special
prosecutor. More trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The parallels are not exact. But the denouement is so absolutely
decisive, so final.
</P>
<P>
   The festival is using a new translation from the Norwegian by
former artistic director Jerry Turner, who also stages the show.
Ibsen can seem stilted on the American stage, but Turner's
``Rosmersholm'' might be a respectable older cousin of ``The Young
and the Restless.''
</P>
<P>
   Robin Goodwin Nordli is subtlety itself as the lovely yet
sinister Rebecca West. She's part ruthless Nietzschean superwoman
and part Victorian sweety pie. Anthony Heald is energetically
futile as the prominent, ineffectual man. Richard Farrell is
remorselessly priggish as the special prosecutor. Progressively
bleaker decor and lighting help the scary work of dramatic
purgation.
</P>
<P>
   _``The Good Person of Szechuan'' by Bertolt Brecht. This thorny
epic bristles with bitter satire, high-stress melodrama, class
conflict skirmishes, sardonic little songs, farcical theology and
brain-spraining dialectical materialism. It requires a dozen
actors. They play 30 roles. Then there are some musicians. The show
runs three hours. It is definitely a major undertaking.
</P>
<P>
   Director Penny Metropulos' production is a triumph of style:
beautiful set, expressive costumes, dramatic lighting and
high-voltage acting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good Person'' is a Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde tale. Shen Te, a
prostitute, is compassionate and generous. When three deities come
to earth looking for a truly good person, they find only one: Shen
Te. They reward her with $1,000. She buys a tobacco shop. Her
compassion and generosity nearly bankrupt her.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing that compassion and generosity are not effective
business strategies, Shen Te devises an alter ego. She disguises
herself as a man, her alleged cousin, the cunning and hard-driving
Shui Ta, who quickly becomes a tobacco magnate.
</P>
<P>
   Brecht was cynical to the point of nihilism. He has an abstract
abhorrence of poverty. But the actual poor people in his plays are
manipulative, dishonest and generally repulsive.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the interest of ideological neatness, Brecht contends
that there is ``an answer'' to poverty, inequality, injustice and
exploitation. By the time Brecht died in 1956, ideological neatness
was eclipsed by political messiness. The supposed ``answer'' was
East Germany, where Brecht lived as a celebrity, a member of the
new privileged class.
</P>
<P>
   Director Metropulos' production of ``Good Person'' is not just a
triumph of style. It is also a triumph of aesthetic discipline over
political indulgence.
</P>
<P>
   In the title role, BW Gonzalez is a wonder of energetic
versatility as the romantic and emotional Shen Te and the mean and
crafty Shui Ta.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``El Paso Blue'' by Octavio Solis. This tragi-comedy could be
``Othello's'' Chicano cousin. Al, a Texas Mexican, marries Sylvie,
a lovely blonde (``third runner-up in the Miss Texas contest!'').
Al, unlike Othello, has ample reason to be jealous. His own father,
Marcelo, becomes Sylvie's lover while Al is in jail.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, ``El Paso Blue'' is even more bizarre,
preposterous and unbelievable than ``Othello.'' But like
``Othello'' director Tony Taccone, the director of ``El Paso
Blue,'' Tim Bond, stages this 100-minute one-act in such a way that
it casts a compelling spell.
</P>
<P>
   Bond cross-breeds Yankee hyper-realism with Latino magic
realism. His actors walk and talk like Rio Grande marginals, El
Paso desperadoes. But set, lighting, music and dramatic structure
conjure up dreams and paranormal marvels. As Sylvie, Linda Halaska
stops being a drunken slut from time to time and sings, sometimes
in English, sometimes in Spanish. In a whiskey soprano she evokes
bluesy versions of ill-fated love. She is accompanied by the
composer of these songs, Michael ``Hawkeye'' Herman, who is seated
with dobro, guitar and other musical essentials in the bed of a
broken-down pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   I would recommend adventurous playgoers who happen to be in
Ashland take time to see ``El Paso Blue.'' But they will have to
get here by June 26, the day of the play's final performance.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Chicago'' by Maurine Watkins. Violence as entertainment,
justice as farce and hypocrisy as a prerequisite to successful
public life _ very up-to-the-minute. The festival puts these
seemingly timely disgraces into historical perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicago'' (the 1926 play on which the musical of 30 years ago
was based) has been revived by director Kenneth Albers. His show is
a lot like a Saturday morning ``Kartoon Kaper'': loud,
two-dimensional and aggressively unsubtle. But a cartoon runs for
20 minutes, max. ``Chicago's'' noisy caricatures of city life,
lawyers, prosecutors, police, husbands, jailers, inmates, jurors
and even journalists run a little over two hours. After about 20
minutes, the yelling and posturing become monotonous.
</P>
<P>
   Playwright Watkins covered crime for the Chicago Tribune in the
'20s. In 1924 she got months of Page One bylines with sensational
stories about two lovely confessed murderesses who, what with one
thing and another, were acquitted. ``Chicago'' is based on that
experience. It was a Broadway hit. DeMille Pictures made it into a
(blessedly) silent movie. In 1942, Ginger Rogers starred in a film
version called ``Roxie Hart.''
</P>
<P>
   As she grew older, Watkins was loath to permit further stagings
or adaptations of ``Chicago.'' It was not until after her death in
1968 that Bob Fosse could buy the rights to create a musical
version. Watkins had profound reservations about the cynicism,
flippancy and farcical satire of ``Chicago.'' Well she might.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Three Musketeers,'' adapted by Linda Alper, Douglas
Langworthy and Penny Metropulos from Alexandre Dumas' novel. This
is twaddle. But at least it is well-aged, vigorous twaddle. Dumas'
1844 novel has been brought to life by at least a dozen filmmakers
and almost that many playwrights. Yet the old war horse will
probably be a crowd pleaser.
</P>
<P>
   The story doesn't really have a plot. But it has enough
conflicts to fill 50 tales: Catholics vs. Protestants, King Louis
XIII vs. Cardinal Richelieu, Queen Anne vs. husband Louis, Queen
Anne vs. the cardinal, the cardinal's guards vs. the king's
musketeers, England vs. France, Athos vs. the Countess de Winter;
the countess vs. D'Artagnon _ and on and on. Love relationships,
flirtations, seductions, friendships and romances are almost as
plentiful as animosities.
</P>
<P>
   Holding all this loosely together are the events of 1625 to 1628
as they pertain to D'Artagnon. He comes to Paris, a boy bumpkin
from Gascony. The three musketeers turn him into a Real Man. John
Hansen is fiery and gallant as D'Artagnon. He comports himself
honorably in the swinging-on-a-rope bit without which no ``Three
Musketeers'' (or ``Tarzan'') show would be complete.
</P>
<P>
   Metropulos stages the spectacle with lavish everything: fencing,
romancing, dancing, fleeing, chasing, quivering and raging. There
are some 30 major characters and about half that many
supernumeraries. Composer Todd Barton provides musical underscoring
that makes sure we know when to get excited, when to get sad and
when to get mushy.

AS THEY LIKE IT: OREGON FESTIVAL RIDING HIGH ON BARD'S WAVE OF
POPULARITY

   ASHLAND, Ore. _ Thank you, Gwyneth.
</P>
<P>
   Big movies have advertising budgets that run into the millions
of dollars. America's largest non-profit theater venture has hardly
any ad budget at all.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, the Oregon Shakespeare Festival is getting a sort
of ricochet promotional bounce from celebrated movies such as
``Shakespeare in Love,'' ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' and
``Elizabeth.''
</P>
<P>
   William Shakespeare is currently prominent on the ``A list'' of
bankable Hollywood names.
</P>
<P>
   And his hot status is not likely to cool off quickly. More
Shakespeare-based movies will be coming along in the near future:
``Titus'' with Anthony Hopkins, ``Love's Labour's Lost'' directed
by Kenneth Branagh and starring Alicia Silverstone, and ``Hamlet''
with Ethan Hawke.
</P>
<P>
   ``When `Shakespeare in Love' won the Oscar,'' says festival
executive director Paul Nicholson, ``we were featured on the
`Today' show, we were written up in USA Today. That kind of
publicity no amount of money could buy. This is the year of
Shakespeare, and for a lot of people, we are Shakespeare's official
representatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Festival artistic director Libby Appel says ``Shakespeare in
Love,'' which featured Oscar-winning performances by Gwyneth
Paltrow and Judi Dench, is essentially a ``wonderful Hollywood
romance.'' But, she adds, ``I couldn't be more thrilled about
anything that helps people see that Shakespeare is timeless and
universal. His work is about our lives and times, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, of course, the movie publicity has been good for our
box-office business,'' Appel says.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which kicked off its outdoor summer shows last
weekend, has just completed its best spring season ever.
</P>
<P>
   Until this year, the festival had no advertising budget. Media
coverage and word of mouth kept three theaters operating at 90
percent capacity, an astronomical rate by performing-arts
standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year we have a minuscule advertising budget, something
like $35,000,'' Nicholson says. ``One of the festival's goals is to
reach not more people necessarily but a broader spectrum of people.
So we've been experimenting with ways to draw in the Hispanic and
African American communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Since its founding in 1935, the Ashland festival has grown into
one of Southern Oregon's major industries: $14.6 million budget,
762 performances, 354,147 tickets sold.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, the festival plans to open a new $8 million intimate
showbox with about 300 seats, replacing its tiny 138-seat Black
Swan Theater.
</P>
<P>
   As usual when Ashland makes changes, there has been a local
outcry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are really fond of the Black Swan, they love the
intimacy,'' says Nicholson. ``But from a producer's point of view,
the Black Swan is not intimate. It's cramped.''
</P>
<P>
   In its usual manner when it is contemplating change, the
festival staff is setting up meetings with community groups and
officials to smooth ruffled feathers and to consider local
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the right to do whatever we want, within zoning and
building regulations,'' Appel says. ``We don't need permission. But
we don't want the community to go ballistic. We're in partnership
with the community in a sense. And 14 of our 30 board members are
locals.''
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO ...
</P>
<P>
   Ashland, Ore., is nine hours south of Seattle via Interstate 5
or 90 minutes by air (to Ashland's neighbor Medford).
</P>
<P>
   Tickets to Oregon Shakespeare Festival productions range from
$11 for standing room to $49 for box seats. The festival offers
discounts for students, seniors and groups. An hour before
showtime, unsold tickets are sometimes available at half-price. The
festival box-office number is 541-482-4331.
</P>
<P>
   The festival operates three theaters: the 600-seat Angus Bowmer,
the 1,200-seat open-air Elizabethan and the 140-seat Black Swan.
Productions at all three theaters continue through the end of
October. Tickets prices are reduced 15 percent starting Oct. 5. In
addition to dramatic productions, the festival offers lectures,
exhibits, play readings, concerts and tours.
</P>
<P>
   The festival is not the only live entertainment in the Ashland
area. The slickest of the so-called ``off-Bardway'' enterprises is
the Oregon Cabaret Theatre. Its current production is the
country-western musical comedy ``Pump Boys and Dinettes.'' Tickets
are $14-$21. Food and drink are available; 541-488-2902.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the Shakespeare Festival brochure is an extensive
guide to accommodations, camping, golf, shopping, sightseeing,
bicycling, child care, river trips, exhibitions and restaurants
throughout the Ashland area.

   SEATTLE _ During Australia's early '80s film renaissance,
Britain was sometimes depicted as the evil empire.
</P>
<P>
   Directors such as Peter Weir and Bruce Beresford excoriated
Mother England in movies such as ``Gallipoli'' and ``Breaker
Morant.''
</P>
<P>
   My, how times have changed.
</P>
<P>
   A new wave of talent from Down Under that has crashed upon the
international film shore _ Cate Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush and Rachel
Griffiths, among others _ has embraced England and, better, won a
pile of British Academy and Golden Globe awards and Oscar
nominations because of her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth,'' ``Shakespeare in Love'' and ``Hilary and Jackie''
are examples of England and Australia (and half a dozen other
countries as well) aligned artistically in an industry where, as
Blanchett once told me, ``there's no such thing as real nationalism
any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Griffiths may be the least common household name of the
three Aussies, but she's fast coming into her own. The 31-year-old
actress brings a knowing intelligence to each role she undertakes,
and as actor Rush suggested in our 1996 interview, ``She's really
sexy, isn't she?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have sex appeal in a blue cheese kind of way,'' laughs
Griffiths during a recent phone interview. ``You either like it or
you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffiths won the best supporting actress award in Australia for
her first role as Rhonda, the wild, game-for-anything best friend
in P.J. Hogan's 1995 tragi-comedy, ``Muriel's Wedding,'' and she
hasn't looked back. A string of well-regarded, if little-seen
movies made by Australians followed: ``To Have and to Hold,''
``Cosi,'' ``Amy'' and ``Children of the Revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Griffiths took the leap. She co-starred in ``Jude,''
British director Michael Winterbottom's relentlessly grim
adaptation of Thomas Hardy's equally dour novel, and won acclaim in
her brief but sexually charged screen portrayal of Arabella, Jude's
duplicitous wife.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, she's worked primarily in England _ ``Among
Giants,'' ``Divorcing Jack'' and her picture-stealing,
Oscar-nominated role in ``Hilary and Jackie,'' which propelled her
career and gave her the pick of projects.
</P>
<P>
   She did a favor to Hogan by making an indelible comedic
appearance in his box office hit ``My Best Friend's Wedding,'' and
then directed the whimsical ``Tulip,'' a short film based upon a
story her mother told about her great uncle.
</P>
<P>
   Now she has returned to England.
</P>
<P>
   Griffiths has called to talk about ``My Son the Fanatic,''
another made-in-England venture.
</P>
<P>
   In it, Griffiths plays a prostitute named Bettina who falls in
love with a kind, middle-aged Pakistani taxi driver, played by Om
Puri. The unlikely romance is set against a backdrop of religious
and political upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   The actress is friendly and funny, and she admits she can't
``keep a secret.'' As she discusses her career and life, she's
forthcoming and candid. Yes, she once arrived topless to protest
the opening of a casino in Melbourne, and she believes she has a
responsibility to the world, though ``I don't actually see myself
as political.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I have a social responsibility, a responsibility
as a person in society to care about, and respond to, how people
are treated. I'm lucky because I have a profile,'' she says,
``though I don't care for politics at all _ or politicians. But I
definitely have very strong feelings that society should care for
its less fortunate and people should be equally respected despite
religion, color or sexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I should just keep my mouth shut,'' she laughs, ``but I
think many actors have done marvelous work to bring an awareness to
issues that otherwise wouldn't be visible. That might be perceived
cynically by journalists or the public at large.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffiths, who grew up in a middle-class Catholic family, says
she sometimes selects roles based upon how her social consciousness
responds to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a certain kind of human values that I was raised
with, and it has influence on the kind of stories I want to tell.
But more than the roles, I think I'm just more interested in
telling particular stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``The different parts you play do affect you. And I've done
roles where I wasn't laughing and joking between takes. In `Hilary
and Jackie,' the role was so oppressive to me and I had to keep so
much of myself contained that between takes I had to get
hyperactive and the kid in me had to come out and run around and be
obnoxious so I could be still on camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I did a role recently in a comedy called `Me, Myself and
I,' and I had to look after my own energy to make sure my onscreen
energy had life and dynamic. I think on `Muriel's Wedding,' I had a
lot of nervous energy. I must say that different roles affect me in
different ways, and I might run around laughing and joking but in
truth, I take my work terribly seriously, and from the moment I
start a job to the wrap party where I write myself off, I live with
the character 24 hours a day. It gets exhausting.''
</P>
<P>
   That diligence also has earned Griffiths much attention. The
term ``best-kept secret'' and adjectives like ``hot,'' ``next big
thing'' and ``brink'' are often attached to her name, but the
actress just shrugs off the fanfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have to separate yourself and one's own
self-definition from the way the world defines you. I think if you
really start to rile against the way you're perceived and certainly
the little boxes journalists stuff you in for a quick byline,
you'll get so frustrated and it's just not worth the effort.
Sometimes it amuses me but occasionally I'm right offended for
different reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's why she takes character roles rather than
conventional leads. She likes to buck the system and, with her
recent directing stint, may be looking for alternate ways to ensure
career longevity. But she shrugs at that, saying at the moment
she's not putting ``too much pressure'' on herself to continue
directing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My acting career is going very well right now and I'm doing
some other things, like writing. Directing `Tulip' was an
experience I really enjoyed a lot. But I don't know.'' She laughs
and says, ``I'm certainly not going to publicly commit.''

DEAL-MAKING ADDS SPICE TO A CAJUN SENATOR'S CAREER

(DW) 
 By ROBIN TONER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John Breaux, D-La., smells some action, some
movement, maybe, down the road, the possibility of a deal. This
makes Breaux a happy man, because he loves making deals.
</P>
<P>
   It clearly still rankles the 55-year-old senator, who was
chairman of the bipartisan commission on Medicare, that he was
unable to deliver a deal on restructuring the 34-year-old health
insurance program for the elderly. His commission disbanded in
March, under fire from President Clinton and utterly polarized over
a proposal that Breaux thought was a workable compromise.
</P>
<P>
   But now the game is on again. ``I love it,'' Breaux declares,
sprawled in a Senate office that is a shrine to guydom: tennis
trophies, stuffed birds shot by the senator back home, fishing
paintings, Mardi Gras posters, family portraits of the four
children and two grandchildren. Breaux says he is pushing forward
with his Medicare proposal in the Senate; the Senate Finance
Committee is trying to move on the issue, and at this very moment
on this Friday morning, two White House aides are outside Breaux's
office, waiting to brief him on Clinton's soon-to-be-unveiled
Medicare plan.
</P>
<P>
   If he cannot be ambassador to France _ more on that later _ what
better challenge than trying to find a lasting remedy for a big,
expensive, endangered program with a fearsome constituency?
</P>
<P>
   Breaux is good at capturing the nervous congressional dance
around Medicare. ``In even years we cut the program, in odd years
we put the money back in,'' he says. ``We cut, last year, $113
billion out of the program, and this year, we'll put money back in
because everybody's hollering. Next year we'll cut it again, then
the year after we'll put the money back. That's the SOS approach _
same old same old _ and it's not doable anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he seems an unlikely player in the Medicare debate, which
tends to have its own wonky priesthood steeped in the arcane
liturgy of managed competition, adverse risk selection and provider
reimbursement rates. This is, after all, a man who takes his
identity with Louisiana seriously. He includes favorite recipes on
his official Senate Web site and never misses a Mardi Gras, which
he celebrates lavishly both here and in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   He first went to Congress in 1967 as an aide to then-Rep. Edwin
Edwards, one of the more flamboyant politicians ever produced in
America, and declares that, ``Being dull would be, to me, just the
ultimate sin.'' He notes that he regularly performs on a stage with
a washboard during Mardi Gras. ``Nobody in Louisiana is going to
get upset,'' he says, ``they've seen hundreds of pictures of me up
on the stage playing the washboard, or running around with an
umbrella.'' Breaux's most famous utterance probably came in 1981
when he declared that his vote could not be bought, ``but it is
available for rent.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Breaux takes his politics seriously. He was elected to the
House at the age of 28, succeeding Edwards, and after 14 years
there moved to the Senate in 1986, where he landed a seat on the
Finance Committee, ground zero for most of the big tax and health
care issues. In many ways a classic Southern Democrat, always
hunting for the middle of the road, he was a longtime believer in
the Democratic Leadership Council, eventually served as its
chairman, and still preaches its ``third way,'' centrist dogma of
``opportunity, responsibility and community.''
</P>
<P>
   He argues that Medicare is a creaky program with an outdated
benefit package _ notably lacking coverage for prescription drugs _
and an excessively bureaucratic structure. He would replace it with
a competitive system that would offer the elderly an array of
choices, from different managed care plans to the traditional
fee-for-service option that is the norm today; the federal
government would give beneficiaries a fixed amount of money to pay
for the plans.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is anathema to many liberals, and Clinton assailed
it on several grounds, contending its drug benefit was too scanty
and it lacked sufficient safeguards for the traditional Medicare
program.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Breaux go way back, but Breaux insists he has no
hard feelings over Clinton's rough critique. ``Didn't bother me in
the least,'' Breaux says. ``Everybody running around saying, `My,
God, he threw you out to sea without a boat and a paddle.' Didn't
even faze me. He was responding to a large constituency in the
Democratic Party that was very strongly opposed to the
recommendation of change.''
</P>
<P>
   Now change is in the air. Breaux says he thinks the Clinton plan
will be ``a positive good start.'' The two had talked about it
briefly by phone the night before, when the White House tracked
Breaux down at a local steakhouse. For his part, Breaux says he
will begin the hunt for the center. What if there is no center in
this brutally polarized Congress on this ultimate third-rail issue?
``Everything has a center,'' he says with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   It can be fun to be a wonk, Breaux says. ``Clinton obviously is
a wonk, the ultimate wonk, but God he has fun being a wonk,'' the
senator said. ``He got in trouble he's had so much fun being a
wonk.''
</P>
<P>
   His press secretary cleared her throat.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, another dream job for this Cajun whose
father spoke French before he spoke English: ambassador to France.
That moment has probably passed, he acknowledges. ``I asked Clinton
one time, `Do you think I could handle France?''' Breaux says
slyly. ``He said, `The question is whether France could handle
you.'''

A GIANT INSURANCE FRAUD HAS CORPORATE VICTIMS

 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The effects of a giant insurance fraud involving a Connecticut
money manager are rippling across the industry and have already
claimed their first two corporate casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with sudden, overwhelming losses as a result of the
scandal involving over $300 million in missing money, a small
Virginia life insurer was seized by state regulators, and a New
York insurance company confronted with $67 million in unexpected
liabilities was forced into a merger.
</P>
<P>
   The downfall of the two insurance companies _ Capital Re Corp.
of New York and Settlers Life Insurance Co. of Bristol, Va. _
occurred in recent weeks, but their connection to the scandal
involving the money manager, Martin Frankel, has emerged only in
the last few days.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies' troubles underscore what may be one of the
most significant aspects of the scandal: The fundamental structure
of the insurance business means that companies across the industry
_ and not just those directly linked to Frankel _ are potentially
at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Government investigators think Frankel, a reclusive Greenwich,
Conn., money manager who vanished in early May, orchestrated a
fraud over almost a decade in which he embezzled huge sums of money
from insurance companies that he controlled.
</P>
<P>
   But neither Capital Re nor Settlers Life was controlled by
Frankel. Rather, they did business with his companies. As the
scandal unfolded, both companies found themselves liable for huge
sums of money as a result of their transactions with the Frankel
empire.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance experts said such damage could continue to spread
through the industry as other transactions with companies
controlled by Frankel were uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   Even insurers that had no dealings with the companies under
Frankel's control are likely to suffer financially. They will be
required to contribute to funds designed to make sure policyholders
do not suffer losses. Potentially, the contributions to the fund
could lead to increased premiums for other policyholders.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators estimate losses to Capital Re of about $67 million.
They put the Virginia company's losses at about $44 million. Most
of the tens of thousands of policies in seven companies controlled
by Frankel provided benefits of less than $5,000 each and were
designed to pay for funeral costs, regulators said.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated calls to the offices of Capital Re and to executives'
homes on Friday afternoon were not returned. Settlers Life referred
calls to state regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies were involved in reinsurance, insurance that
backs up the coverage of other insurers and is widely used in the
industry to spread risk. In Capital Re's case, a subsidiary acted
as an intermediary between one of Frankel's companies and other
insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Divine, the chief financial examiner for the Missouri
Department of Insurance, said the Capital Re subsidiary received a
commission for passing $67 million in policies to Frankel's
companies.
</P>
<P>
   According to Virginia and Mississippi regulators, Settlers Life
dealt directly with First National Life Insurance Co. of America, a
Mississippi company under Frankel's control, transferring its own
assets and deducting a portion as a fee for itself. Under insurance
law, Capital Re and Settlers Life remained liable for the policies.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the lingering liability, it is vital for insurers to
accurately assess the financial strength of companies to which they
pass on or cede business.
</P>
<P>
   The Frankel-controlled companies that Capital Re and Settlers
Life dealt with, like most of Frankel's companies, had low
financial ratings. Most were equivalent to junk bonds. Regulators
said that just as with issuers of junk bonds, it is likely that
Frankel paid higher-than-usual fees to entice companies to transfer
assets to him.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers that seek assets from other companies calculate that
they will be able to trim administrative costs and raise profits
through economies of scale. Many also think that their investing
skills will enable them to increase earnings on the assets.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel portrayed himself as an investing wizard. But regulators
say it now appears that his real objective was to amass money in
his insurance companies that he could siphon off through his
investment company, Liberty National Securities.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of his dealings with Settlers Life were devastating.
The company began the year with a comfortable $23 million in
capital and surplus. But with the loss in Frankel's company,
Settlers suddenly found itself more than $25 million short of the
minimum of $4 million in capital and surplus that Virginia requires
of insurers, and the regulators stepped in.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The losses with Frankel's companies were the latest in a series
of blows to Capital Re, which specializes in reinsuring relatively
low-risk bond insurance. It was forced to set aside $44.1 million
to cover claims on securities sold by Commercial Financial
Services, a credit-card debt company that sought bankruptcy
protection last December. It also reported potential losses of as
much as $10 million in the insolvency of a Pittsburgh hospital
system.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Michael Satz, who had been chief executive since
helping to found Capital Re in 1988, was replaced by Jerome
Jurschak, another founder.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Ace Ltd., one of the world's leaders in high-stakes
commercial insurance, agreed to provide Capital Re with $75 million
in exchange for a 12 percent stake in the company.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Moody's Investors Service cut Capital Re's financial
rating by two notches from Moody's highest level, and the insurer's
stock value dropped 16 percent. Ace then negotiated more favorable
terms on its investment.
</P>
<P>
   An insurance trade publication, the National Underwriter,
reported in April that Ace was offering to buy Capital Re. But, the
trade paper said, Capital Re executives were unwilling; the
company's stock would have to rebound before they agreed. The stock
was then trading at $19.25.
</P>
<P>
   But over the Memorial Day weekend, with its stock several
dollars lower, Capital Re simultaneously disclosed $67 million in
losses and its decision to accept a merger offer from Ace for about
$600 million in stock. That worked out to about book value.
Analysts said similar companies would be expected to sell for one
and a half to two times that.
</P>
<P>
   When Capital Re disclosed the losses, Frankel's connection with
the failed companies was not known. Initially, the regulators'
seizure of Settlers Life also appeared to be an isolated case.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts said the latest losses would have increased
pressure for another reduction in financial ratings, which might
have been disastrous for Capital Re. But by joining with Ace, which
has an estimated $31 billion in assets, Capital Re's finances were
immediately shored up.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't have much of a choice,'' Ira Zuckerman, an analyst
at Nutmeg Securities, said. ``They pretty much had to take Ace's
offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Vetto, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said that in
Capital Re's area of specialization, backing up bonds, high
financial ratings are essential. ``Contracts are signed on the
basis of credit quality,'' he said. ``If that changes, the business
can leave.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Stuff that'll continue to amaze you and maybe even
your friends pulled from the pages of a book called Ultimate Sports
Lists (DK Publishing, by Mike Meserole, $17.95, 224 pgs):
</P>
<P>
   __The Lakers won five NBA titles in the 1980s, but actually
finished second to Boston in regular-season victories that decade.
OK, so it was only by one, 592 to 591.
</P>
<P>
   __During the '70s, the Pittsburgh Steelers (99-44-1) won four
Super Bowls, but the Los Angeles Rams (98-42-4) had a better record
in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   __When the Seattle Mariners move from the cavernous Kingdome to
Safeco Field in two weeks, Dodger Stadium will be the fifth-largest
major-league baseball park, with a 56,000 capacity.
</P>
<P>
   __Maury Wills' record 104 stolen bases with the Dodgers in 1962
now stands at only No.7 all-time.
</P>
<P>
   __The Dodgers are the only major-league baseball team of the
'90s to finish in the top 10 in wins (No.5 with 720, tied with
Boston) but have no postseason victories in the decade.
</P>
<P>
   __Of the top-grossing contemporary sports movies, Adam Sandler's
``The Waterboy'' ranks second (behind ``Jerry Maguire'') and ahead
of all four ``Rocky'' movies.
</P>
<P>
   __After Michael Jordan (46) and Muhammad Ali (35), the next two
athletes most frequently seen on the cover of Sports Illustrated
are Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (28) and Magic Johnson (24).
</P>
<P>
   __The NHL single-game record for most penalty minutes assessed
to one player is 67 by the Kings' Randy Holt against the
Philadelphia Flyers in 1979. No.2 on the list with 55 is the
Flyers' Frank Bathe. In the same game, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Both were given three majors and two 10-minute misconducts, but
Holt received one more game misconduct (three, to Bathe's two),
plus one minor penalty to beat him to the punch. And to the top of
the list.

<P>
   ASHLAND, Ore. _ Thank you, Gwyneth.
</P>
<P>
   Big movies have advertising budgets that run into the millions
of dollars. America's largest non-profit theater venture has hardly
any ad budget at all.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, the Oregon Shakespeare Festival is getting a sort
of ricochet promotional bounce from celebrated movies such as
``Shakespeare in Love,'' ``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' and
``Elizabeth.''
</P>
<P>
   William Shakespeare is currently prominent on the ``A list'' of
bankable Hollywood names.
</P>
<P>
   And his hot status is not likely to cool off quickly. More
Shakespeare-based movies will be coming along in the near future:
``Titus'' with Anthony Hopkins, ``Love's Labour's Lost'' directed
by Kenneth Branagh and starring Alicia Silverstone, and ``Hamlet''
with Ethan Hawke.
</P>
<P>
   ``When `Shakespeare in Love' won the Oscar,'' says festival
executive director Paul Nicholson, ``we were featured on the
`Today' show, we were written up in USA Today. That kind of
publicity no amount of money could buy. This is the year of
Shakespeare, and for a lot of people, we are Shakespeare's official
representatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Festival artistic director Libby Appel says ``Shakespeare in
Love,'' which featured Oscar-winning performances by Gwyneth
Paltrow and Judi Dench, is essentially a ``wonderful Hollywood
romance.'' But, she adds, ``I couldn't be more thrilled about
anything that helps people see that Shakespeare is timeless and
universal. His work is about our lives and times, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, of course, the movie publicity has been good for our
box-office business,'' Appel says.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which kicked off its outdoor summer shows last
weekend, has just completed its best spring season ever.
</P>
<P>
   Until this year, the festival had no advertising budget. Media
coverage and word of mouth kept three theaters operating at 90
percent capacity, an astronomical rate by performing-arts
standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year we have a minuscule advertising budget, something
like $35,000,'' Nicholson says. ``One of the festival's goals is to
reach not more people necessarily but a broader spectrum of people.
So we've been experimenting with ways to draw in the Hispanic and
African American communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Since its founding in 1935, the Ashland festival has grown into
one of Southern Oregon's major industries: $14.6 million budget,
762 performances, 354,147 tickets sold.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, the festival plans to open a new $8 million intimate
showbox with about 300 seats, replacing its tiny 138-seat Black
Swan Theater.
</P>
<P>
   As usual when Ashland makes changes, there has been a local
outcry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are really fond of the Black Swan, they love the
intimacy,'' says Nicholson. ``But from a producer's point of view,
the Black Swan is not intimate. It's cramped.''
</P>
<P>
   In its usual manner when it is contemplating change, the
festival staff is setting up meetings with community groups and
officials to smooth ruffled feathers and to consider local
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the right to do whatever we want, within zoning and
building regulations,'' Appel says. ``We don't need permission. But
we don't want the community to go ballistic. We're in partnership
with the community in a sense. And 14 of our 30 board members are
locals.''
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO ...
</P>
<P>
   Ashland, Ore., is nine hours south of Seattle via Interstate 5
or 90 minutes by air (to Ashland's neighbor Medford).
</P>
<P>
   Tickets to Oregon Shakespeare Festival productions range from
$11 for standing room to $49 for box seats. The festival offers
discounts for students, seniors and groups. An hour before
showtime, unsold tickets are sometimes available at half-price. The
festival box-office number is 541-482-4331.
</P>
<P>
   The festival operates three theaters: the 600-seat Angus Bowmer,
the 1,200-seat open-air Elizabethan and the 140-seat Black Swan.
Productions at all three theaters continue through the end of
October. Tickets prices are reduced 15 percent starting Oct. 5. In
addition to dramatic productions, the festival offers lectures,
exhibits, play readings, concerts and tours.
</P>
<P>
   The festival is not the only live entertainment in the Ashland
area. The slickest of the so-called ``off-Bardway'' enterprises is
the Oregon Cabaret Theatre. Its current production is the
country-western musical comedy ``Pump Boys and Dinettes.'' Tickets
are $14-$21. Food and drink are available; 541-488-2902.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the Shakespeare Festival brochure is an extensive
guide to accommodations, camping, golf, shopping, sightseeing,
bicycling, child care, river trips, exhibitions and restaurants
throughout the Ashland area.

<P>
   It's gun week on A&AMP;E, five hourlong reports on gun fanciers and
opponents, the companies that make guns, the lobbyists who champion
them, the youngsters who own them and associated matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guns in America'' begins Monday night with a look at people
for whom the gun is a recreational tool or a means of defense or a
way to make a living. We meet several ``cowboy action shooters''
who gather from time to time in Wild West garb and play-act events
involving Jesse James, Buffalo Bill and the Deadwood Stage. The
action shooters, who pull their triggers only in fun and never in
anger, are against gun regulations of all sorts.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to Nevada, a gun-friendly state, finds Japanese tourists
drawn there to try out weapons that are not available to them at
home. At a Soldiers of Fortune convention featuring slogans like
``Fight Crime, Shoot Back,'' reporters are warned that they are in
``a hostile environment.'' Members of the Michigan Militia are seen
in the woods playing war games, and women who have been victims of
assault are seen perfecting their shooting skills.
</P>
<P>
   Professional gun advocates like Larry Pratt, who speaks for Gun
Owners of America, make a case that gun ownership is in an American
tradition of defending one's homes and families against big
government, and John Lott, the author of ``More Guns, Less Crime,''
reports that his research has persuaded him of the beneficial
consequences of having a gun or two around the house.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, promises Bill Kurtis, the narrator,
``Investigative Reports'' will focus on the National Rifle
Association; on Wednesday, Kurtis interviews Mayor Richard J. Daley
of Chicago about his plans for suing gun manufacturers and dealers;
Thursday turns to the manufacture and sales of guns, and Friday
ends the series with ``Young Guns,'' on children's ``right'' to own
and carry weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guns in America'' confirms that despite a post-Littleton surge
of support for gun-control laws, the fight is far from over.

MINI-REVIEWS OF SHAKESPEARE PRODUCTIONS AT ASHLAND FESTIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOE ADCOCK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ Henry IV, Part Two. To emphasize the boys-will-be-boys nature
of this political and military action/adventure story, ``Henry IV,
Part Two,'' director Libby Appel uses an all-male cast.
</P>
<P>
   As with any might-makes-right drama in which authority, majesty
and venal institutions are glorified, ``Henry IV, Part Two'' is
hard to take at times. But Appel's casting experiment certainly
pays off. The feats of virtuoso acting are fun to watch. Dan
Donohue, for example, is boyish and then manly as England's royal
prince. Donohue also plays the lowly clowns Wart and Fang. Even
better, G. Valmont Thomas plays both the doughty rebel knight
Colville and the ludicrous innkeeper Mistress Quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Also funny and outrageous is Ken Albers as the parasitical and
opportunistic Sir John Falstaff. Albers starts buoyant and
dissolute. Over the course of the play's nearly three hours, he
steadily declines into demoralized exhaustion. Falstaff is a
barometer of ``Henry IV, Part Two's'' political climate. He blooms
in the early atmosphere of cozy chaos. He withers when
law-and-order comes into its own.
</P>
<P>
   _ Othello. The rap on this bizarre tragedy is that it is
preposterous and unbelievable. The title character is brilliant but
stupid. The villain, Iago, is driven. He's a fiend. But it's hard
to comprehend what it could possibly be that is driving such
outrageous fiendishness. That's all on the level of sociological
reality.
</P>
<P>
   Director Tony Taccone is not concerned with sociological reality
in this brilliant, stirring production. His ``Othello'' looks and
sounds like a powerful ritual. It moves on the level of emotional
and spiritual realities.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of candles loom in the background during the killing
scene, making death seem like a religious sacrifice. A
nowhere/anywhere world of Venetian blind slats creates a scene of
spying, hiding and hampered perception. Music suggests a pounding
heart, occasionally disrupted by shattering dissonances. The
characters wear costumes that are part long ago and far away and
part here and now.
</P>
<P>
   In this irrational but compelling world, Othello and Iago and
their many unfortunate cohorts are comprehensible. As Othello,
Derrick Lee Weeden is a cunning soldier, professionally, and a
befuddled innocent, romantically. His beloved Desdemona as played
by Amy Cronies is enough of a flirt and a sexual manipulator to
make Iago's accusations of infidelity a little plausible. Anthony
Heald, as Iago, is one of those borderline personalities we all
meet from time to time: glib and desperate, halting and inventive,
absurd and yet somehow convincing. He's delusional, paranoid and
compulsive.
</P>
<P>
   As Cassio, the lieutenant who has supposedly, according to
Iago's allegations, seduced Desdemona, Andrew Borba is unusually
interesting in a role that can come off as no more than a plot
device. Fight choreographer John Sipes does a fantastic job with
the crazed brawl that Cassio sets off in his alcoholic fury.
</P>
<P>
   Taccone's presentation of infatuation and dishonesty, passion
and madness, give the bizarre incidents of ``Othello'' the look of
things that, alas, happen every day.
</P>
<P>
   _ Much Ado About Nothing. This dark comedy has an all-out
villain, but Don John is merely a plot device. He helps to weave a
background fabric. The fabric serves one purpose: it gives the
celebrated Beatrice and Benedick a foundation on which to work out
their intricate needlepoint of wit and love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much Ado'' holds the world record for eavesdropping and
deception. Two ninnies, Hero and Claudio, mean to marry. The
nefarious Don John slanders Hero. Claudio backs out of the
marriage. Through the good offices of a team of clown constables,
the baselessness of the libel comes to light. So the ninnies marry
after all.
</P>
<P>
   But that background is mostly stage dressing for the Beatrice
and Benedick show. Elizabeth Norment and Mark Murphy make an
unusually nuanced B and B. Their put-down humor is funny. But it
has a certain awkwardness; it has the poignancy of unduly prolonged
adolescence. Pride takes a beating if a person is playing catch-up
in the game of romance. Norment and Murphy are good with that agony
and urgency.
</P>
<P>
   Director James Edmondson has worked out ample visual humor. He
emphasizes the comic aspect of this dark comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Edmondson has chosen to set this ``Much Ado'' in early
20th-century Argentina. Lots of military braggadoccio. Lots of
preening machismo. Lots of punctilio about virginity and such. And,
best of all, the Argentine milieu provides a pretext for a flashy
tango finale.
</P>
<P>
   Other shows
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Seven Guitars'' by August Wilson. This tragedy is set in
Pittsburgh's black ghetto in 1948. The seven guitars referred to in
the title are actually four men and three women. Like members of a
jazz ensemble, each player has a particular temperament and tone, a
characteristic tempo and volume. Each has his or her characteristic
riffs. Each tells stories that define individual and collective
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   And like any blues tune, ``Seven Guitars'' is never exactly the
same piece twice. Director Benny Leon's version is both livelier
and quieter than what we've grown used to in Seattle from Wilson's
preferred director, Lloyd Richards. When the characters are rowdy,
they really bounce and whoop. When they are meditative, the theater
becomes as still as a Zen temple. And when anger flashes, it looks
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The personification of anger and danger is Derrick Lee Weeden as
a West Indian immigrant, Hedley, who has been driven half-mad by
degradation and disappointment. As Hedley, Weeden conveys delusions
of grandeur as skillfully as he portrays Othello's crazed loss of
grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   Leon draws out high definition, high-energy characterizations
from his whole ensemble: G. Valmont Thomas as a bouncy drummer,
Kevin Kenerly as a quirky harmonica man; Ken LaRon as a passionate
and desperate singer/guitarist; Susan Champion as a young woman who
has ``a certain effect on men''; Andrea Frye as a brassy beautician
who is wised-up and sassy; and Deidrie Henry as a mature woman torn
between desire and fear, hope and despair.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Rosmersholm'' by Henrik Ibsen. According to that pioneering
drama critic Aristotle, an effective tragedy ``purges'' us.
Different tragedies purge different things for different people at
different times.
</P>
<P>
   For me, just now, the excellent festival production of Ibsen's
1886 tragedy ``Rosmersholm'' helps purge all that Monica
Lewinsky/Whitewater/Ken Starr stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Ibsen's protagonist is an ineffectual but prominent man. He has
vague ideals. He talks a lot. He accomplishes little. Along comes
an irresistible young woman. Trouble. Along comes an
arch-conservative, prurient, nosy self-appointed special
prosecutor. More trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The parallels are not exact. But the denouement is so absolutely
decisive, so final.
</P>
<P>
   The festival is using a new translation from the Norwegian by
former artistic director Jerry Turner, who also stages the show.
Ibsen can seem stilted on the American stage, but Turner's
``Rosmersholm'' might be a respectable older cousin of ``The Young
and the Restless.''
</P>
<P>
   Robin Goodwin Nordli is subtlety itself as the lovely yet
sinister Rebecca West. She's part ruthless Nietzschean superwoman
and part Victorian sweety pie. Anthony Heald is energetically
futile as the prominent, ineffectual man. Richard Farrell is
remorselessly priggish as the special prosecutor. Progressively
bleaker decor and lighting help the scary work of dramatic
purgation.
</P>
<P>
   _``The Good Person of Szechuan'' by Bertolt Brecht. This thorny
epic bristles with bitter satire, high-stress melodrama, class
conflict skirmishes, sardonic little songs, farcical theology and
brain-spraining dialectical materialism. It requires a dozen
actors. They play 30 roles. Then there are some musicians. The show
runs three hours. It is definitely a major undertaking.
</P>
<P>
   Director Penny Metropulos' production is a triumph of style:
beautiful set, expressive costumes, dramatic lighting and
high-voltage acting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good Person'' is a Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde tale. Shen Te, a
prostitute, is compassionate and generous. When three deities come
to earth looking for a truly good person, they find only one: Shen
Te. They reward her with $1,000. She buys a tobacco shop. Her
compassion and generosity nearly bankrupt her.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing that compassion and generosity are not effective
business strategies, Shen Te devises an alter ego. She disguises
herself as a man, her alleged cousin, the cunning and hard-driving
Shui Ta, who quickly becomes a tobacco magnate.
</P>
<P>
   Brecht was cynical to the point of nihilism. He has an abstract
abhorrence of poverty. But the actual poor people in his plays are
manipulative, dishonest and generally repulsive.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the interest of ideological neatness, Brecht contends
that there is ``an answer'' to poverty, inequality, injustice and
exploitation. By the time Brecht died in 1956, ideological neatness
was eclipsed by political messiness. The supposed ``answer'' was
East Germany, where Brecht lived as a celebrity, a member of the
new privileged class.
</P>
<P>
   Director Metropulos' production of ``Good Person'' is not just a
triumph of style. It is also a triumph of aesthetic discipline over
political indulgence.
</P>
<P>
   In the title role, BW Gonzalez is a wonder of energetic
versatility as the romantic and emotional Shen Te and the mean and
crafty Shui Ta.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``El Paso Blue'' by Octavio Solis. This tragi-comedy could be
``Othello's'' Chicano cousin. Al, a Texas Mexican, marries Sylvie,
a lovely blonde (``third runner-up in the Miss Texas contest!'').
Al, unlike Othello, has ample reason to be jealous. His own father,
Marcelo, becomes Sylvie's lover while Al is in jail.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, ``El Paso Blue'' is even more bizarre,
preposterous and unbelievable than ``Othello.'' But like
``Othello'' director Tony Taccone, the director of ``El Paso
Blue,'' Tim Bond, stages this 100-minute one-act in such a way that
it casts a compelling spell.
</P>
<P>
   Bond cross-breeds Yankee hyper-realism with Latino magic
realism. His actors walk and talk like Rio Grande marginals, El
Paso desperadoes. But set, lighting, music and dramatic structure
conjure up dreams and paranormal marvels. As Sylvie, Linda Halaska
stops being a drunken slut from time to time and sings, sometimes
in English, sometimes in Spanish. In a whiskey soprano she evokes
bluesy versions of ill-fated love. She is accompanied by the
composer of these songs, Michael ``Hawkeye'' Herman, who is seated
with dobro, guitar and other musical essentials in the bed of a
broken-down pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   I would recommend adventurous playgoers who happen to be in
Ashland take time to see ``El Paso Blue.'' But they will have to
get here by June 26, the day of the play's final performance.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Chicago'' by Maurine Watkins. Violence as entertainment,
justice as farce and hypocrisy as a prerequisite to successful
public life _ very up-to-the-minute. The festival puts these
seemingly timely disgraces into historical perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicago'' (the 1926 play on which the musical of 30 years ago
was based) has been revived by director Kenneth Albers. His show is
a lot like a Saturday morning ``Kartoon Kaper'': loud,
two-dimensional and aggressively unsubtle. But a cartoon runs for
20 minutes, max. ``Chicago's'' noisy caricatures of city life,
lawyers, prosecutors, police, husbands, jailers, inmates, jurors
and even journalists run a little over two hours. After about 20
minutes, the yelling and posturing become monotonous.
</P>
<P>
   Playwright Watkins covered crime for the Chicago Tribune in the
'20s. In 1924 she got months of Page One bylines with sensational
stories about two lovely confessed murderesses who, what with one
thing and another, were acquitted. ``Chicago'' is based on that
experience. It was a Broadway hit. DeMille Pictures made it into a
(blessedly) silent movie. In 1942, Ginger Rogers starred in a film
version called ``Roxie Hart.''
</P>
<P>
   As she grew older, Watkins was loath to permit further stagings
or adaptations of ``Chicago.'' It was not until after her death in
1968 that Bob Fosse could buy the rights to create a musical
version. Watkins had profound reservations about the cynicism,
flippancy and farcical satire of ``Chicago.'' Well she might.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Three Musketeers,'' adapted by Linda Alper, Douglas
Langworthy and Penny Metropulos from Alexandre Dumas' novel. This
is twaddle. But at least it is well-aged, vigorous twaddle. Dumas'
1844 novel has been brought to life by at least a dozen filmmakers
and almost that many playwrights. Yet the old war horse will
probably be a crowd pleaser.
</P>
<P>
   The story doesn't really have a plot. But it has enough
conflicts to fill 50 tales: Catholics vs. Protestants, King Louis
XIII vs. Cardinal Richelieu, Queen Anne vs. husband Louis, Queen
Anne vs. the cardinal, the cardinal's guards vs. the king's
musketeers, England vs. France, Athos vs. the Countess de Winter;
the countess vs. D'Artagnon _ and on and on. Love relationships,
flirtations, seductions, friendships and romances are almost as
plentiful as animosities.
</P>
<P>
   Holding all this loosely together are the events of 1625 to 1628
as they pertain to D'Artagnon. He comes to Paris, a boy bumpkin
from Gascony. The three musketeers turn him into a Real Man. John
Hansen is fiery and gallant as D'Artagnon. He comports himself
honorably in the swinging-on-a-rope bit without which no ``Three
Musketeers'' (or ``Tarzan'') show would be complete.
</P>
<P>
   Metropulos stages the spectacle with lavish everything: fencing,
romancing, dancing, fleeing, chasing, quivering and raging. There
are some 30 major characters and about half that many
supernumeraries. Composer Todd Barton provides musical underscoring
that makes sure we know when to get excited, when to get sad and
when to get mushy.

 &HT;    Pitchers duel ends with Braves victory
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine have good pitches, good
control, and a good commercial. Their timing ain't bad either.
</P>
<P>
   Picking the N.L. Central leading Astros on the last roadtrip and
the New York Mets this weekend, the dynamic duo won back-to-back
games again just when the Braves needed it. The Mets were in town,
looking for some hope and a pennant race, but left with a 1-0 loss,
their second in a row, and another four-game deficit to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine's seven innings of outstanding work in Saturday's 7-2
win was topped only by Maddux's eight innings of two-hit scoreless
ball on Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monkey see, monkey do,'' was Maddux's cerebral explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux moved to 7-5 and dropped his ERA under 4.00 for the first
time since April at 3.87. He took another step toward making May
look flukish and reminding the Mets that Glavine and Maddux don't
stay down long, for what that's worth in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that big of a deal,'' Maddux said. ``Maybe mentally
it's good for us to win two out of three. We want to stay in first
place. Still got a ways to go. We know that.''
</P>
<P>
   The only Braves' run came in the third inning via a liner to
left by Eddie Perez, who was 5 for his last 44 (.114) entering the
game, and Ozzie Guillen's double to right center to score him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a Venezuelan run,'' Perez declared. ``All this talk
about Curacao.''
</P>
<P>
   Guillen, who'd hit .319 in his previous 17 games as Walt Weiss's
replacement at shortstop, extended his hitting streak to five
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a pretty good hitter to be Punch and Judy,''
said Guillen, who's a career .265 hitter. ``I'm playing the way I
always play ... (But yeah) it's a lot better when you know you're
going to play the next day. You get a chance to make adjustments
from one at-bat to the next.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux pitched four perfect innings before giving up a couple of
two-out singles in the fifth inning, but the only time his 1-0
seemed in jeopardy was after he walked Brian McRae in the eighth.
But he stranded McRae at third with a two-out strikeout of pinch
hitter Matt Franco on a 3-2 changeup.
</P>
<P>
   With Maddux tiring, the Braves turned to John Rocker, who struck
out Rickey Henderson for the first out. He then gave up a single to
Edgardo Alfonzo and watched him take second on a John Olerud
groundout. Manager Bobby Cox decided to walk Mike Piazza to bring
up Robin Ventura, which looked good after Rocker struck Ventura out
with a slider for his 16th save of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to put the winning run on,'' Cox said. ``Could have
gotten burned, but once you make a decision, you live with it.

 &HT;    Jordan one HR away from 100 milestone
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Braves cleanup hitter Brian Jordan hit the road for
Montreal on Sunday afternoon sitting on home run No. 99 of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ain't 500,'' Jordan said before Sunday's game. ``Just a
milestone.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Jordan, who leads the Braves with 15 home runs, it's
pretty significant considering he hasn't been that big of a power
hitter throughout his career.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's 25 home runs with the Cardinals was a career high.
He'd hit 22 in 1995 but otherwise never topped 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what my potential is as a home run hitter,''
Jordan said. ``I've never hit a lot of home runs, even in college.
I was usually a doubles, triples, stolen base guy. But with
experience and learning how to hit and using a natural swing I'm
becoming more of a home run hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan flirted with No. 100 in the seventh inning Sunday when he
yanked a Mosato Yoshii pitch just a few inches foul of the left
field fair pole before grounding out on the next pitch.
</P>
<P>
   But as is usually the case, Jordan said he does better when he's
not trying for home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go out and try not to hit them and that's when they come,''
Jordan said. ``I try not to worry about it. My focus is 100 RBI,
100 runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Hudek called up; Speier sent down
</P>
<P>
   The Braves recalled reliever John Hudek from his 30-day
rehabilitation assignment in Richmond and optioned Justin Speier to
Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   Hudek was 0-0 with a 6.35 ERA in 12 games in Richmond. He
pitched 11.1 innings, gave up 14 hits, eight earned runs, five
walks and 17 strikeouts. Hudek went on the disabled list
technically for a blister on his third finger but theoretically to
regain his form. He had an 11.17 ERA when he left Atlanta in May.
</P>
<P>
   Speier, who was first called up on April 14, leaves with a 5.65
ERA after allowing 11 runs in two of his last three outings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just go down there and work my butt off and pitch the way
I'm capable of pitching,'' Speier said. ``It's been fun. I'll go
down there and keep my focus and work hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Perez banged up
</P>
<P>
   This playing-every-day business has turned out to be a lot
harder than Eddie Perez had figured.
</P>
<P>
   One look at him and it's plain to see. The catcher, who's
started the last seven games since Javy Lopez went on the disabled
list with a sprained knee, looks like a boxer who lost a fight _
stitches recently taken out from over his eye after a home-plate
collision, a purple-colored right eyelid, a ball-sized red and
purple bruise on his right shoulder from a foul tip, and another
one on his thigh from a foul tip.
</P>
<P>
   ``(My wife) doesn't even want to look at me,'' said Perez with a
smile. ``I thought it was going to be something easy, but it's
killing me. Maybe when (Lopez) gets back, I'll go on the D.L.

 &HT;    Devers leaps over leg problems for 100-meter win
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. _ No doubt about it, Gail Devers is back. And
Andria King has arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Just a month ago, the 32-year-old Devers was told her season
might be over. Her right hamstring badly strained, the Olympic
champion could barely walk, let alone harbor thoughts of hurdling.
</P>
<P>
   In a testament to modern medicine, Devers held up well enough to
power her way to victory over the 100-meter hurdles in 12.54
seconds Sunday at the USA Track and Field Championships. Earlier,
Devers finished a strong second in the 100 meters.
</P>
<P>
   That's the stuff the track world has come to expect of Devers,
who makes her home in Alpharetta after starring in the Atlanta
Games.
</P>
<P>
   But King, who graduated from Georgia Tech this month, startled
even herself by finishing third in a career-best 12.73, and earning
a trip next month to the World Championships. King celebrated with
her parents and put in a call to her boyfriend, former Tech
basketball star Matt Harpring, while Devers stepped off the track
to take a call from her parents watching on TV back in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought my season was over,'' said Devers, in her first
hurdles competition since the Atlanta Olympics. ``I had so many
problems with my leg recently. I pulled my hamstring in three
places. I was having problems with my thyroid again. They
discovered I was anemic.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I could do is believe in myself, and hope I could get
through it. I honestly believe I have a guardian angel on my
shoulder, a guardian angel looking out for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Devers took it cautiously through the first two rounds, but at
the urging of her longtime coach Bobby Kersee she was her old self
for Sunday's final, aggressively attacking the wooden barriers en
route to a comfortable win.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say hurdling is like riding a bike, you never forget
it,'' Devers said. ``For me, it's amazing how much you do forget
after three years. It's getting used to going over the hurdles,
getting all the bumps and bruises again.''
</P>
<P>
   For King, the pain has been in the finish _ never an NCAA
champion, four times a runnerup. She came here eager for a step up
in class, to ready herself for the World University Games and her
first tour on the European circuit this summer. If she advanced to
the finals, she'd have been delighted.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, King, had to pinch herself as she stood on the medal
podium with Devers, later relishing in a victory lap around Hayward
Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think this would happen in my wildest dreams,'' said
King, a Marist graduate who turned 23 last week. ``I grew up
idolizing Gail Devers. She was like Michael Jordan to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being around Gail, she's real nice. All the girls have been
very nice. Nobody makes me feel like a white girl, a young girl _
all of which I am.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, a U.S. teammate.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DJAKOVICA, Yugoslavia _ In the two weeks since NATO forces
arrived in Kosovo, alliance officials have scaled back their
initial estimates of the damage inflicted by the 78-day air
campaign on the Yugoslav army, which they concede remains a force
capable of maintaining Slobodan Milosevic's hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO and Pentagon officials stand by their claims to have
significantly damaged the Yugoslav army and special police, they
acknowledge that the units that withdrew from Kosovo a week ago
were clearly not as hobbled as they had believed.
</P>
<P>
   And those forces, they acknowledge, could be employed by
Milosevic again, at least to squelch domestic disturbances within
Serbia, and at most to either foment or face down a separatist
threat from Yugoslavia's lesser republic, Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exaggerated,'' said a former senior allied official, who
spoke to top European leaders in recent days, referring to NATO's
early damage estimates. ``NATO hit a lot of dummy and deception
targets. It's an old Soviet ploy. Officials in Europe are very
subdued. No one's pounding their chest over this.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Djakovica, for example, NATO obliterated the Yugoslav
army's World War II-era base. In what was left of the motor pool,
18 military vehicles, including one armored personnel carrier, were
scattered Sunday in charred, twisted heaps.
</P>
<P>
   Up close, however, it was clear that most of the destroyed
vehicles were old wrecks, assembled there by the Serbs for repairs
or junking. NATO's warplanes had not destroyed Yugoslavia's
front-line fighting vehicles, but rather a junkyard.
</P>
<P>
   From blown-out military barracks to exploded fuel tanks, the
devastating results of NATO's bombing are obvious all across
Kosovo. But the damage brought down on the Yugoslav army itself _
particularly the tanks, armored fighting vehicles and artillery
batteries at its core _ is less clear.
</P>
<P>
   Even in those places where allied bombers launched intense
attacks _ in Junik and the villages around Mount Pastrik in
southern Kosovo where Yugoslav forces had massed against the Kosovo
Liberation Army in the last weeks of the war _ there are few signs
of the scorched carcasses of tanks or other military equipment that
NATO officials expected to find.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is here,'' Lt. Col. Dietmar Jeserick, a spokesman for
the German peacekeeping troops based in Prizren, said Sunday. ``We
found positions. We found bomb damage in those positions, but we
didn't find any vehicles or tanks.''
</P>
<P>
   While some vehicles were removed from Kosovo by Serb forces to
break down for spare parts, NATO officials themselves acknowledge
that fewer pieces of military hardware were destroyed than the
alliance had first estimated.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's supreme commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, said last week that
the alliance had, for example, destroyed 110 of the roughly 300
tanks that the Yugoslav army had poured into Kosovo. But that
number was less than the 150 tanks NATO believed it had destroyed
in the waning days of the war, one senior NATO official said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark and other NATO and Pentagon officials emphasize, however,
that NATO's bombing ultimately accomplished its mission, which was
to force Milosevic to end his brutal campaign against Kosovo's
ethnic Albanians and turn the province over to a NATO-led
peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our perspective, we're satisfied we destroyed enough
stuff to get him to say, `Uncle,''' Capt. Stephan Pietropaoli of
the U.S. Navy, the spokesman for the Pentagon's Joint Chiefs of
Staff, said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   But whether it was indeed the pain inflicted on his military
that formed Milosevic's prime motivation for ending the standoff
over Kosovo is an open question.
</P>
<P>
   One senior NATO official said that many leaders at NATO believed
that it was not the damage to the Yugoslav forces that finally
forced Milosevic to relent, though the alliance intercepted
communications from Serb commanders saying that their troops were
suffering heavy losses in the battles around Mount Pastrik.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the official said, Milosevic relented when Russia, long
a supporter, came to accept NATO's conditions and the consensus for
considering a ground campaign to oust his forces from Kosovo
appeared to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Such an assessment may gain still greater currency as NATO takes
full stock of the size of the Yugoslav army that completed its
withdrawal from Kosovo a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   As the Serbs pulled out over 11 days, NATO commanders counted
220 tanks, 300 armored personnel carriers and 308 artillery
batteries, along with hundreds of other vehicles and all manner of
military equipment loaded on trucks, according to NATO officials
here and in Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   There were also 47,000 soldiers and police who left the
province, several thousand more than intelligence reports showed
during the height of Milosevic's campaign. The officials attributed
the discrepancy to paramilitary units, whose movements were harder
for NATO to track. But the large numbers also appeared to undercut
NATO's claims to have killed 5,000 to 10,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's government, eager to obscure the fact that it lost a
province considered by many Serbs to be Serbia's cultural,
religious and historical birthplace, has used state-run television
to show troops returning triumphantly from Kosovo. The government
also claimed that only 576 soldiers and policemen had been killed.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks to reporters while visiting Kosovo last week, Clark
dismissed questions about the extent of NATO's punishment and
ridiculed Milosevic's claims as absurd. ``Just because the air
campaign stopped doesn't mean the Serb propaganda campaign
stopped,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that a complete picture would not be known until
NATO sends analysts here in the coming weeks to assess the success
of the airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has also announced that the deputy secretary of
defense, John Hamre, and the vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, Gen. Joseph Ralston, would lead a thorough review of the
war, including the damage done to the Yugoslav army.
</P>
<P>
   In war, initial assessments of damage are often overblown; the
oratory almost always is. After the Persian Gulf war ended in 1991,
the Pentagon learned that it had not hurt the Iraqi army nearly as
much as was first thought. The bombing and ground invasion by the
U.S.-led coalition left it badly beaten, but still strong enough to
put down rebellions in northern and southern Iraq and threaten
Kuwait again only three years later.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, there are several explanations for scaling back the
damage assessments now, officials said. Careful reviews of cockpit
video footage showed that pilots in some cases mistakenly believed
they had destroyed a target. They also showed that some of the
targets hit were not tanks or artillery batteries, but rather
clever decoys made by the Serbs to fool pilots flying three or four
miles up in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Outside its armed forces, however, Yugoslavia as a whole clearly
suffered enormous damage, particularly to its roads, bridges and
industry after 11 weeks of increasingly intense bombing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   According to a Pentagon assessment compiled after Milosevic
agreed to NATO's demands, allied warplanes destroyed Yugoslavia's
oil-refining ability, nearly half of its military fuel-storage
facilities and many of its factories producing military equipment
and ammunition. The alliance also reported eviscerating
Yugoslavia's air force of its most sophisticated jets and
inflicting some heavy damage on Yugoslav ground forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Charles Wald, a senior analyst on the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, said that 60 percent of the barracks and other facilities of
Yugoslavia's Third Army in Kosovo had been either damaged or
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Not a single building at the army base in Djakovica was
habitable; many were leveled entirely. NATO bombs dug huge craters
in the earth, strewing debris everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also clear that the Serbs took advantage of the
restraints that kept allied pilots at high altitudes and under
orders to avoid civilian casualties, to escape greater destruction
of their heavy ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   Up and down western Kosovo, there are revetments where Serb
tanks and artillery pieces hunkered down, well hidden, particularly
at the foot of Mount Pastrik.
</P>
<P>
   There are also scores of decoys. Some of them involve older
vehicles fashioned to look like tanks. Others are comical. A few
miles west of Pristina, there is still a ``bridge'' of logs and
black tarp 100 yards from the main road. On either end were two
``tanks'' made of wood and plastic sheeting, with long tubes
protruding toward the sky.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, the decoys would fool no one, and NATO officials
said pilots quickly learned to distinguish them, but a fake bridge
near Djakovica took a missile right through its center span.
</P>
<P>
   At least one tank rests in a charred heap on a hill at a
military base near Urosevac, and local Albanians said several
remained in the hills above Junik, an area inaccessible because of
land mines.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger mystery is what happened to the tanks and other heavy
equipment that NATO did destroy. The senior NATO official said that
the retreating Serbs took a lot of damaged tanks with them,
ferrying them back on flatbed trucks to use as spare parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took out every last scrap they could,'' he said, ``so
when they get back to Yugoslavia, they can cannibalize bits and
pieces to put things back together.''

   Issues Go Beyond Price for Frontier and U S West
</P>
<P>
   When the boards of Frontier and U S West meet to discuss the
hostile bid made by Qwest Communications International, the debate
will go beyond the dollar value of the competing offers made by
Qwest and Global Crossing.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of their deals with Global Crossing, the boards
of Frontier and U S West have to conclude that Qwest's offer is
adequately ``superior'' to Global's before they can begin
negotiations with Qwest. To do that, they will need to examine the
strategic fit, the possible structure of any deal and the
regulatory risks.
</P>
<P>
   New Paper to Chronicle Deal Making
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Wasserstein, the high-rolling deal maker and author of a
book on deal making, is about to introduce a newspaper about
high-rolling deal making called The Daily Deal. The paper, which is
scheduled to start five-day-a-week publication on Sept. 15, intends
to provide in-depth coverage of deals, their progress, financial
and legal architecture and how they panned out.
</P>
<P>
   Libel Trial Revisits Murder Case
</P>
<P>
   A woman who was identified by a detective as a suspect in the
murder of her husband, a Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing
executive, but was never charged, has sued the detective and a
television station for libel. The trial is being closely watched by
the media and legal communities.
</P>
<P>
   Human Element of E-Commerce
</P>
<P>
   Electronic commerce companies have spent millions of dollars
trying to make their sites more ``personal,'' with technology that
allows them to customize their product offerings to shoppers' needs
and software that automatically responds to customer inquiries by
e-mail. Now those sites are trying a novel approach to
personalization: real people.
</P>
<P>
   For Ease of Computing, the iToaster
</P>
<P>
   Microworkz.com, a maker of low-price computers in Seattle, has
introduced a computer it contends is as easy to use as a toaster
oven and has aptly named it the iToaster. It is a combination
word-processing, home-finance and Web-browsing machine.
</P>
<P>
   Account Reviews Going Online
</P>
<P>
   In another example of how the Internet is transforming the way
Madison Avenue does business, a French company is offering an
Internet service intended to assist in conducting account reviews
online. Other companies have already been capitalizing on the
benefits of interactivity for agency reviews by offering Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Saturn Upsizing
</P>
<P>
   Saturn, the small-car brand that General Motors created a decade
ago to win back baby boomers from imports, will begin selling a
midsized car in July and plans to add a small sport utility vehicle
in about two years.

RUSSIANS DROWN SORROWS, THEN SELVES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)  (rk) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Poverty and political chaos have surely taken their
toll on this nation. But for a look at what is really corroding
Russia's soul, take the day off and go to the beach.
</P>
<P>
   That is what Moscovites are doing this month, and they are
perishing in numbers that would stagger most Westerners.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 20 days of June, 89 people drowned in Moscow rivers
and reservoirs. Over a long holiday weekend in mid-June, police
fished at least 13 bodies out of Moscow waters every day _ the
average number of daily drownings for the entire United States.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it just Moscow's problem. The annual drowning rate for
Russia is 8 per 100,000, compared with 1.68 per 100,000 in the
United States. Russian men, who account for the vast bulk of
drownings, die at an annual rate of 1 in 5,700.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are huge numbers _ bigger than the murder rate in the
U.S.,'' said Philip C. Graitcer, an Emory University professor and
author of a paper on injury rates in the former Soviet Union,
referring to the rate for Russian men. ``They're astounding.''
</P>
<P>
   But not to most Russians. They already know what autopsies of
this month's drowned Moscovites show in black and white: 94 per
cent of the victims were officially drunk when they died.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol has a death grip on this nation, and the statistics on
drownings and other injuries show vividly how powerful that grip
is. Russia has about twice the rate of fatal injuries, including
murders and suicides, that the United States has. Among the kinds
of deaths commonly linked to alcohol, the rate is roughly 1.5 times
as high in Russia as in the United States for automobile accidents,
three times as high for suicides, and five times as high for
poisoning deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Killings are more common in Russia; fatal falls occur more
often. Even Russian women die from drowning at twice the rate of
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But by far the heaviest toll is exacted on men, who statistics
show drink more and die needlessly far more often than practically
anywhere on earth. By some studies, men here drink eight times as
much alcohol as do women, and their death rates from accidents and
injuries far exceed those of women in almost every category _ from
fires, for example, by three times; from alcohol poisoning, by a
factor of five.
</P>
<P>
   For Russian men, ``it's a terrible tragedy.'' said Sergei
Yermakov, the principal researcher for the Russian Ministry of
Public Health and an expert on mortality. ``And unfortunately, the
people who are responsible for social policy _ they don't
understand that all of their forces should be aimed at
prevention.''
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol has historically been a major problem in Russia, dating
to the time of the czars. And bad as the situation is today, it was
far worse just five years ago, when in statistical terms, Russia
bottomed out. From 1990 to 1994, the years when the old Soviet
Union and, after its collapse in 1991, Russia were in the deepest
throes of economic and social change, deaths from almost all causes
skyrocketed. The death rate for injuries alone rose 83 per cent.
</P>
<P>
   Yermakov and others attribute many, though not all, of those
increases to the growing stresses placed on almost everyone during
those days. That, combined with the end of the government monopoly
on alcohol sales, triggered a huge increase in drinking, especially
among men.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the pace of reform,'' said Vladimir Shkolnikov, a
Russian Academy of Science mathematician who is probably the
nation's leading expert on mortality. ``It was labor force
turnover, the magnitude of change in the early '90s.''
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, the death statistics have fallen since then, back to
the approximate levels of 1990 _ perhaps because many of the people
most vulnerable to stress simply died off, some experts say. But it
must be remembered that those levels _ and today's _ remain
exceedingly high, Shkolnikov added.
</P>
<P>
   Yermakov recently went to Washington to present a paper on
poisonings and other injuries to American researchers and to
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I presented these figures to the Gore-Chernomyrdin
commission,'' he said, referring to the two officials' ongoing
cooperation on a series of issues, ``they couldn't believe that
drownings in Russia were eight to 10 times more common than
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Viewed by the numbers, drownings like those in Moscow this month
offer an exceptional look at how drunkenness accounts for such a
vast share of deaths from injury.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, with some 265 million people, records about
5,000 deaths by drowning each year, and has for much of this
decade. The typical drowning in America occurs in a swimming pool,
and many victims are unsupervised children.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a far smaller population, 147 million, about 25,000
Russians drowned last year. Much of that sum is explained by the
fact that Russians often take dips in lakes and reservoirs, where
swimming may be banned and no lifeguard is present. And many of the
victims are indeed children.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike in the United States, the prime candidate for
drowning in Russia is a male between the ages of 15 and 65. About
one in 5,000 such men died last year.
</P>
<P>
   Yermakov said that alcohol is certainly behind these high rates.
Alcohol plays a role in accidental deaths in many nations, of
course. Even in the United States and parts of western Europe, it
is said to be a factor in 50 to 70 per cent of drownings, not to
mention its role in traffic accidents and homicides.
</P>
<P>
   But in Russia, the trend is so pronounced that the high rate of
male deaths from injuries is one of the major reasons why Russian
women live longer than men _ more than 12 years longer, in fact,
the biggest gap in the developed world.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say they know beyond a doubt that alcohol is a major
factor because they saw what happened in the late 1980s, when the
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev tried to stem his nation's decline
by cracking down hard on vodka consumption with restrictions on its
sale and an increase in alcoholism treatment programs.
</P>
<P>
   During that two-year campaign, deaths from injuries and
poisonings plummeted so dramatically that the drop added a full two
years to the life expectancy of Russian men and a half-year to that
of women.
</P>
<P>
   When Gorbachev gave up on his campaign in 1987, injury deaths
promptly rose again. By 1992, they had sliced more than two years
back off the average man's expected lifespan.

VISA WAIVER PILOT PROGRAM HAS HELPED TERRORISTS AND CRIMINALS ENTER
U.S.  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Nigeria, United Kingdom, Ireland, Sweden)   By JOHN FILES    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A program that allows some visitors to the United
States to enter the country without a visa is helping criminals and
terrorists and increasing illegal immigration, according to an
internal investigation at the Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's inspector general found that the Immigration and
Naturalization Service has not done enough to end abuses of the
Visa Waiver Pilot Program, which lets people carrying passports
from any of 26 nations to visit the United States for up to 90 days
without first obtaining a visa. The program has been in place since
1988.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which was intended to cut down on paperwork in
admitting large numbers of visitors from a small number of
countries, is strongly supported by the trade and tourism
industries. In 1997, 14.5 million visitors entered the United
States under the visa waiver program, coming from the United
Kingdom, Japan, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Ireland, Brunei, Slovenia
and Andorra, among other countries.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael R. Bromwich, the inspector general, said: ``Our
review found that terrorists, criminals, smugglers, and others have
attempted to enter the United States using stolen blank passports
from a Visa Waiver country or by altering or counterfeiting these
passports.'' He testified about his office's report at a
Congressional hearing last month.
</P>
<P>
   Few VWPP countries reported problems with passport theft prior
to participation in the program, INS officials said. But the agency
estimates that more than 100,000 blank passports have been stolen
in the last several years.
</P>
<P>
   When investigators looked at a a sample of 1,067 blank VWPP
passports reported stolen in 1997, almost 4 percent matched
passports successfully presented for entry into the United States,
the inspector general's audit found.
</P>
<P>
   Extrapolating from that sample, the auditors suggested that
thousands of people might have misused stolen passports in this
way.
</P>
<P>
   INS inspectors interviewed for the report said that identified
terrorists and criminals believed that they would receive less
scrutiny and would have a better chance of avoiding interception if
they entered the United States under the visa waiver program.
</P>
<P>
   One of the conspirators later convicted in the World Trade
Center bombing attempted entry into the United States in 1992 with
a fraudulent Swedish passport, unsuccessfully trying to exploit
Sweden's participation in the program. He was briefly detained and
then deported. In 1998, two Irish men, one of whom admitted
membership in the Irish Republican Army, were denied entry when INS
inspectors learned that the applicant was also a member of the Real
IRA _ a terrorist group that has broken away from the original IRA.
In 1988, the INS in New York discovered a trend in which Nigerian
drug couriers were using photo-substituted passports from the
United Kingdom to smuggle narcotics into the country.
</P>
<P>
   The program also makes it easier to immigrate illegally to the
United States, investigators said. Because the program eliminates
the need to obtain a visa, visitors under the program avoid the
pre-screening that consular officers normally perform on visa
applicants. INS inspectors at ports of entry become the principle
means of preventing illegal entry. But the inspectors have, on
average, less than one minute to check and make their decision on
each visitor.
</P>
<P>
   The INS has said it ``generally'' supported the findings in the
report, but pointed to several factors out of its control. For
example, the State Department nominates countries for the program,
and participating countries have their own standards for issuing
passports and reporting them stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Michael A. Pearson, the executive associate commissioner for
field operations at the INS, said that there was no built-in
mechanism for dealing with security breakdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program's lack of appropriate law enforcement standards
mandating compliance or removal from the program has only increased
as the program has been expanded,'' Pearson wrote in his response
to the inspector general's review. ``Regrettably, the statute and
standards for law enforcement concerns have not evolved with the
expansion and we are now in the position of operating this program,
which was predicated on low risk, in a high-risk environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general recommended that INS build a complete data
base on stolen passports from countries that participate in the
program, and make sure that all passport numbers are checked
against the data base in a lookout system used by agents at the
border.

TO ADD PERSONAL TOUCH TO E-COMMERCE, SOME SITES ADD REAL PEOPLE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Electronic commerce companies have spent millions trying to make
their sites more ``personal,'' with technology that allows them to
customize their product offerings to a particular shopper's needs,
and software that automatically responds to customer inquiries by
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Now those sites are trying a novel approach to personalization:
real people.
</P>
<P>
   Partly in response to the customer service blunders of last
holiday season, and partly in anticipation of another Internet
shopping blitz this winter, E-commerce sites are starting to use
live chats and Internet telephony applications to answer questions,
solve problems and, ideally, sell customers more things. In doing
so, these sites are further crushing the myth that E-commerce
companies can get by without investing in a real, live customer
support team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many players are looking at this,'' said Judy Neuman, vice
president for interactive media at Eddie Bauer, and the secretary
of Shop.org, an industry trade group. ``It will become the cost of
entry going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Eddie Bauer, which is owned by Spiegel Inc.,
companies like 911Gifts.com, Etoys, CBS Sportsline, Furniture.com,
Lands' End, Hewlett-Packard and 1-800-Flowers.com, among others,
indicated they were implementing live customer service. In Eddie
Bauer's case, Ms. Neuman said, customers will be able to click on a
button and communicate with a customer service representative via a
one-on-one, text-based chat. If that doesn't suffice, customers
will be able to speak to a representative through their computer,
using Internet telephony technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially as the Internet moves into the mainstream,
consumers are looking for that comfort zone that ties into the
world they're used to,'' said Chris McCann, senior vice president
of 1-800-Flowers, which is implementing an Internet telephony
package to provide customer service. ``Once users get used to
shopping on the site, they won't use it as much, but we like to
think of these things as training wheels for new users.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Neuman declined to name the customer service vendor Eddie
Bauer will use or the cost of the system _ although she did say the
cost was ``substantial''and that the service would be available
starting in October. To handle the rush of inquiries during the
holidays, Ms. Neuman said the company would bolster its customer
service staff from roughly 12 people to a maximum of 60.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ken Allard, an analyst with Jupiter Communications,
companies that sell customer service applications have proliferated
in recent months. Some, like Webline, offer a range of products,
from software that sends out automated responses to e-mail
inquiries to Internet telephony packages and chat software.
Webline's customers include Cisco Systems, Hewlett-Packard,
Mortgage.com and GTE, among others, and its comprehensive customer
service system costs roughly $1,500 per representative to
implement.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies address only part of the customer service
equation. For instance, Liveperson offers chat-based customer
service for roughly $250 a month per representative; its system is
utilized by CBS Sportsline's online golf store, among other sites.
Meanwhile, Net2phone Inc., a unit of the IDT Corp. offers an
Internet telephony-based customer support package, which is
currently being tested by 1-800-Flowers. The system costs between
$500 and $5,000 a year per representative, depending on the size of
the customer service team.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts and executives said the trend toward improved
customer service on line began with a chorus of complaints after
last year's holiday shopping season, when many sites were caught
off guard by the tremendous influx of shoppers. Those sites often
failed to deliver products on time, then failed to respond promptly
to customers' e-mails. Meanwhile, because many E-commerce companies
were founded on the assumption that customer service should be
fully automated, the sites frequently lacked phone-based support
systems.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to losing repeat customers, executives say feeble
customer service systems have resulted in customers not spending
money in the first place. In the last six months, several studies
have indicated that between 33 and 66 percent of customers bail out
of transactions before they are completed. With more customer
service options available to steer consumers through the purchase,
executives hope to convert shoppers into buyers at a much higher
rate.
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce sites also say the average amount of an order is
typically higher when customer service representatives assist in
sales because they can ``upsell'' additional items to potential
customers. If that bears out, the cost of additional staffing
suddenly looks like a bargain, according to Peter Baltaxe,
president of 911Gifts.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say a customer service rep converts five shoppers to a sale
every hour through a chat,'' said Baltaxe, who plans to implement
such a service in the coming months. ``Assuming a $100 gross margin
revenue, and the fact that we pay a customer service rep between
$10 and $15 an hour, the return seems to be a no-brainer.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the more costly customer service packages, however,
the payoff is fast, according to Lou Zambello, senior vice
president for operations at Etoys. Zambello said the company
planned to implement live customer service support, which will
include both a chat component and an Internet telephony package.
While declining to cite the company's planned customer service
expenditure, he said a full suite of customer service applications
could cost retailers ``a few million, when all is said and done;
but it will still pay for itself pretty quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Zambello added that Internet retailers can afford to pay for
such services because they spend comparatively little on routine
transactions, which are handled electronically. ``It then makes
sense to spend more on the tougher transactions, which are the ones
where you'll win the most loyal customers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the idea that live customer service represents an
unexpected and unwanted addition to the E-commerce business model,
Baltaxe of 911Gifts said the practice fitted a larger trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``People look at Amazon buying warehouses and realize that it
does make sense to have a warehouse, and that the low-overhead,
virtual, personless business model doesn't really exist,'' he said.
``It's the same with this. We still have to talk to customers. It's
another piece of the model where people are starting to add more
overhead costs. Internet businesses still have tremendous
advantages, but I think it's turning out to be a little different
than some people expected.'' &QL;

A FINANCIER IS SET TO PUBLISH A NEWSPAPER TO COVER DEAL MAKERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ancient Roman rulers had their likenesses carved in stone,
Renaissance princes and Dutch burghers had theirs painted on
plaster or canvas. Now, in the media age, prominent people carve
their likenesses on new publications: Martha Stewart, the
life-style guru, created a magazine about life styles; Steven
Brill, the reporter-turned-entrepreneur-turned-media baron, started
a magazine about the media.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes Bruce Wasserstein, the high-rolling deal maker and
author of a book on deal making. His publishing company, American
Lawyer Media Inc., is about to introduce a new newspaper about
high-rolling deal making.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about two very different things,'' Wasserstein, who
emerged in the 1980s as a player in deals like Time's 13.4 billion
acquisition of Warner, said last week. ``First, covering the
financing and the deal communities, the corporations, the business
people, the financing, things of that sort. Second, covering the
transactions themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The new entry is called The Daily Deal; it is set to start
five-day-a-week publication on Sept. 15, when the investment
bankers and corporate lawyers and executive vice presidents for
strategic planning have returned from vacation.
</P>
<P>
   There is little question it will have deals to cover, at least
for now. In 1996, the total value of domestic mergers and
acquisitions was $653 billion; in 1997 it was $970 billion; last
year, it jumped to $1.6 trillion. Wasserstein, William L. Pollak,
the president and chief executive of American Lawyer Media, and
Robert Teitelman, the new publication's editor in chief, want to
provide in-depth coverage of deals, their progress, financial and
legal architecture and how they panned out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tactics and tax structures are also going to be of great
interest to our readers,'' Pollak, a former executive vice
president at The New York Times, said last week at The Daily Deal's
half-filled offices on Madison Avenue in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelman, in a separate interview, added that ``the paper is
not designed to be strictly an M &AMP; A paper.'' He added, ``there are
a huge amount of private equity funds out there to cover.'' And
when the bull market ends? ``We'll also cover, when the time come,
bankruptcies and restructurings.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper's editors say, they want to create a new community
of readers out of the sliced-and-diced audience of perhaps 125,000
people who now subscribe to scores of financial newsletters
(including American Lawyer Media's own newsletter on mergers and
acquisitions) and financial newspapers like The American Banker and
The Bond Buyer. For $3.50 an issue and a list subscription price of
$750 a year, they hope to attract an audience of 15,000 in the
first year.
</P>
<P>
   That is the game plan. The initial reality, of course, is that,
like any start-up, the editors are planning to give away thousands
of subscriptions to corporate executives _ perhaps 10,000, all told
_ through free six-week trials, to build up interest, according to
Jack Berkowitz, American Lawyer Media's executive vice president
for strategic planning.
</P>
<P>
   They do, however, have built-in advantages. The Daily Deal will
be American Lawyer Media's 22nd publication. Its legal
publications, like The New York Law Journal, give it an
infrastructure of offices, staff, printers, distributors and
subscriber lists that are costly to build from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Lawyer is in the business of delivering newspapers
around the country,'' Pollak said. He would not confirm the
start-up cost, beyond agreeing that it was in ``single-digit
millions.''
</P>
<P>
   One major issue for the newspaper will be logistics. Faced with
the reality of trucking time needed to get The Daily Deal from New
York to Washington and Boston, or from its San Francisco plant
around California, the editors and the business executives are
still trying to figure out when their deadlines will be _ 5:30
p.m.? 6:30 p.m.? 7:30 p.m.?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the deadline is, Pollak and his managing editor, Ed
Paisley, said, it will inevitably mean that late-breaking
information will not make it into the hard copy of the newspaper
but would make it onto its Web site. And Pollak, who followed The
National, the ill-fated national sports daily, during its
16-and-a-half-month life span, is well aware that late-breaking
news, like timely delivery, is crucial. Pollak said that, among the
problems of The National, which folded in 1991, was its inability
to provide late scores.
</P>
<P>
   But, said Larry Gelfand, the publisher of The Daily Deal, ``We
are fortunate to be launching in the era of the World Wide Web.''
</P>
<P>
   Access to the newspaper's Web site comes as part of the
subscription price, and the 35 or so editorial staffers, along with
a network of stringers in financial capitals around the world, will
supplement the wire services that feed fast-breaking news into the
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The crucial issue for the new publication, however, may not be
its timeliness but its distinctiveness. The proliferation of
financial news _ from wire services to newsletters to Web sites _
has made it harder to find resources, from journalists to ad
salesmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's bold, and I think its entrepreneurial,'' said
Debra Cope, an executive editor at The American Banker, which, as a
164-year-old daily tabloid with a circulation of 17,280, has a
profile not so different from the one The Daily Deal hopes to
create. She added: ``It's also risky. They have got a lot to
prove.''
</P>
<P>
   Brill, the founder of The American Lawyer magazine, who sold his
stake in the enterprise in 1997, before U.S. Equity Partners LP, a
private equity investment fund managed by Wasserstein Perella Group
Inc. bought it, advised Berkowitz that The Daily Deal would need to
grab attention immediately. ``You have to move markets with your
first issue,'' Berkowitz quoted Brill as saying. Brill confirmed
the remark.
</P>
<P>
   Pollak, however, said that American Lawyer would back the new
publication through two years of losses, in the hopes it would be
as valuable to its readers as Daily Variety was to the
entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and what about covering Wasserstein himself, the chief
executive of Wasserstein Perella and chairman of American Lawyer
Media Inc.?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a rule,'' said Wasserstein. ``The rule is there are
no features, pro or con, about us. But if we're part of the
ordinary coverage of an event, treat us like everybody else.''

MAN ACCUSED IN SUBWAY CASE HAD FALLEN THROUGH MENTAL HEALTH
SYSTEM'S CRACKS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By NINA BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the crowded Manhattan subway platform that
evening, everything happened too fast, witnesses told the police.
</P>
<P>
   A man in the crowd was acting strangely. Someone demanded that
he move. He wheeled around and shoved the nearest commuter onto the
tracks as the No. 6 train screeched into the 51st Street station.
The victim's legs were severed before anyone could intervene.
</P>
<P>
   But in the months before the attack at 5:45 p.m. on April 28,
and even in the five hours leading up to that moment, signs of
deterioration in the mental state of Julio Perez, 43, the homeless,
schizophrenic man accused in the incident, went unrecognized,
unheeded or untreated.
</P>
<P>
   The case strongly echoes that of another subway attack allegedly
by a mentally ill man in January that left a woman dead and
provoked mounting criticism of New York state's mental health
system.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Perez had been talking to friends and caseworkers
about hurting people. In March he was kicked out of one program
after becoming increasingly paranoid and belligerent.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the attack, he had gone to a psychiatrist in the
emergency room of a Veterans Affairs hospital, to police
headquarters and to the criminal courts building, complaining in
each place about his treatment in a shelter for the mentally ill,
and telling law enforcement officers that his enemies were
following him, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   In each instance that day, it appears from investigators'
accounts and corroborating interviews, people with only scraps of
information about Perez listened briefly and sent him on his way,
to another part of the same disjointed system that had been
shuttling him between hospitals, jails, shelters and the streets of
New York since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Perez described him as a gentle, poetic man in the
yearlong periods when his mental illness was under control, and in
New York, his only convictions were for farebeating and for smoking
marijuana in public. But a far different, more frightening picture
of him existed in his native Puerto Rico, where Perez had a long
record of criminal violence.
</P>
<P>
   Between his discharge from the U.S. Army in 1978 and his
appearance in a New York City shelter in 1995, his convictions
included attempted murder, aggravated assaults, robberies and
weapons offenses, all clustered in short spurts between prison
sentences of nine, three and two years, according to records
obtained from the Interpol division of the Puerto Rican police
department.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the confidentiality of patient records and the criminal
case pending against Perez, who is in jail on Rikers Island after
being found competent to stand trial on an attempted murder charge
in the subway pushing, few officials involved in his case would
talk on the record.
</P>
<P>
   But a chronology pieced together from details, some of them
provided on the condition of anonymity, as well as from shelter
records, other documents and interviews with five of Perez's
friends, shows that his case has striking parallels to that of
Andrew Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, a schizophrenic man with a long history of violence,
is charged with pushing Kendra Webdale to her death in another city
subway station on Jan. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The Goldstein case has become central in an intensifying debate
over the state's mental health system. Advocates for the mentally
ill say financial constraints on hospitals have raised the
threshold for psychiatric hospitalization, shortened stays for the
acutely ill and eliminated thousands of long-term state hospital
beds.
</P>
<P>
   Intensive case management and supportive housing in the
community are in short supply, they say. But state officials defend
the plan to continue shrinking state hospital population, now down
to 6,000 from 93,000 in 1953, and say that New York already spends
more than $2 billion annually on supportive housing for the
mentally ill, more than any other state.
</P>
<P>
   And state legislators are debating ways to improve what critics
call a makeshift system, cobbled together in ways that neither help
the most severely mentally ill nor protect the public. The debate
in Albany has largely centered around legislation that would allow
mentally ill people to be forced into treatment. But lawmakers are
also considering proposals to provide additional state money for
enhanced community services for the mentally ill, such as
supportive housing.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The victim in the Perez case, Edgar Rivera, an athletic father
of three who had loved playing basketball with his 13-year-old son,
awoke from a weeklong coma without words of anger for his attacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no legs, but at least I have my mind,'' Rivera, 37,
said earlier this month from his hospital bed. ``This guy doesn't
have that. I think I'm ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez entered the city's shelter system for the homeless on Dec.
12, 1995, in a harsh winter when hundreds of men were left sleeping
on the floor at the 30th Street Men's Shelter in Manhattan, the
system's entry point. Like others in the overflow, Perez was likely
bused late at night to the Flushing Men's Annex for a few hours in
a cot on a barracks floor, then dropped to wander the streets again
until nightfall, according to Patrick Markee, public policy analyst
with the Coalition for the Homeless.
</P>
<P>
   In the next years, Perez would spend his nights in a series of
shelters, getting brief stints of psychiatric hospitalization,
sporadic outpatient treatment and psychotropic medication from a
succession of different institutions, depending in part, friends
said, on whether he had slipped back into using street drugs, and
whether his Medicaid card was still valid.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in June 1996, when he was living at the 410-bed Borden
Avenue Veterans' Shelter in Queens, he spent most days on an upper
floor of a public assistance office building near Queens Plaza, in
a program called Citiview Connections. The program, operated by
Goodwill Industries, uses the ``clubhouse'' model of involving the
mentally ill in the day-to-day work of running the center, hooking
them up with education and job opportunities and fostering
friendships.
</P>
<P>
   By the spring of 1997, Perez had lost his bed at the veterans'
shelter for missing curfews and had been arrested on charges of
aggravated harassment, robbery and weapons possession, according to
city shelter system officials, but there was no disposition of that
case. He was assigned to the 900-bed shelter on Wards Island.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998, Perez was flagrantly paranoid, hiding behind
doors from imaginary enemies, according to accounts by friends that
were confirmed by a mental health worker. But after a brief
psychiatric hospitalization, he seemed more stable.
</P>
<P>
   When Perez was not working in the kitchen of the Citiview
clubhouse or at its computers, friends said, he wrote poetry, drew
pictures and spoke about wanting a home. ``He said he was tired of
getting shifted around to all these different shelters and
agencies,'' said Karen W., a friend who asked that her last name
not be published.
</P>
<P>
   Perez befriended another woman at the Citiview clubhouse, but
his mood took a darker turn at the end of 1998, several friends
said, when she rejected his declarations of love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I want to become his girlfriend?'' asked that
35-year-old woman, who said she has been coping with her own mental
illness since she was 17 and asked that her name not be used. ``Who
can want to marry a man who lives in a shelter?''
</P>
<P>
   By then, Perez was living in the Fort Washington Avenue shelter
in upper Manhattan, in a 40-bed program for the severely mentally
ill run by Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital under a contract with the
city. By February 1999, he was complaining that guards and staff
members there wanted him dead and that a fellow clubhouse member
was trying to poison him, and voicing violent fantasies of revenge.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In early March, after a fight at the Fort Washington shelter
left him with a bruised face, his escalating paranoia and
belligerence were seen by caseworkers at the clubhouse in Queens as
alarming symptoms of a psychotic relapse.
</P>
<P>
   They unsuccessfully recommended to psychiatrists at the shelter
that Perez be hospitalized, according to a mental health worker
familiar with the caseworkers' account of the events. At that
point, for the safety of other members, Citiview expelled him.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Pablo Zapon, one of the psychiatrists at the Columbia
Presbyterian shelter program, was asked why Perez was not
hospitalized as caseworkers say they recommended. ``Things are not
like they say, but I can't talk to you.'' Zapon said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alan Felix, who runs the program, also said he could not
talk about the case. His program has been praised by advocates for
the mentally ill as among the best resources in a homeless shelter
system under tremendous pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The advocates said it is harder than ever to get even the
acutely mentally ill admitted to psychiatric hospitals at a time
when shelters are being overwhelmed with patients who have long
record of violence.
</P>
<P>
   State institutions like Creedmoor Psychiatric Center in Queens
continue to discharge patients from their dwindling population, and
supportive housing programs, with far more applicants than they
have accept, pass over the most problem-ridden.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how excellent that shelter is, it's still a
shelter,'' said Susan Batkin, a lawyer specializing in mental
health issues at the Urban Justice Center, a nonprofit advocacy
organization. ``The people with the most serious need for structure
and support are not getting it _ that's the story, not that there
was a bad judgment call by a psychiatrist.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Weiden, a psychiatrist with no connection to the case
who is an authority on patients who take street drugs and stop
taking their psychotropic medication, said the apparent
fragmentation of Perez's care is standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mix and match,'' Weiden said. ``It's a huge problem and
barrier to continuity of care. Basically, no one talks to
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The expulsion from Citiview left Perez devastated and angry, his
friends said. But there also were signs that in the aftermath, he
tried to return to medication that he had abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks before the subway pushing, Karen W. said, Perez called
her, panic-stricken, ranting that he needed medicine for his mind
and that he could not get it because his Medicaid card had been
canceled. Doctors and advocates say losing insurance coverage under
Medicaid is a common problem for the mentally ill homeless, because
welfare-to-work requirements and other eligibility hurdles at
public assistance centers are so hard for them to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before the attack, Karen W. said, he called her again,
saying that he wanted to go back into a hospital, and asking her to
meet him at Columbus Circle to accompany him. She said she waited
for him for half an hour, but he did not show up.
</P>
<P>
   At 12:30 p.m. on April 28, Perez entered the emergency room of
the Veterans' Administration Hospital on 23rd Street and First
Avenue and asked to see a psychiatrist. Computerized records
available to the psychiatrist on duty, Dr. Alberto Gonzales,
reflected that Perez had come to the VA for outpatient psychiatric
treatment intermittently over the years, disappearing for long
periods _ a common pattern, especially among the homeless, doctors
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may have only bounced back to the VA when his Medicaid had
run out,'' said Dr. Page M. Burkholder, a psychiatrist who formerly
worked in the VA system with the homeless. ``Since he was in and
out of the shelter system, he'd be a hard person to track down.''
She added, ``It sounds simplistic, but in the end it all does come
down to housing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales said he could not discuss the case, but according to
investigators, Perez told Gonzales he was upset about his living
conditions at the shelter, and asked for a transfer back to the
veterans' shelter in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales told him, correctly, that any transfer had to be
approved by the city shelter system, and he would have to return to
his current shelter to apply. Perez walked out, seemingly happy,
the doctor told investigators, with an appointment for the
outpatient psychiatry clinic the following day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The VA at 23rd Street is very comfortable with the care
provided to the veteran the last time he presented for care,'' said
Peter Jiuliano, chief medical administrator. ``I can't explain what
happened in those five hours _ it's terrible, terrible for the
victim.''
</P>
<P>
   About 2 p.m., Perez passed through metal detectors in the lobby
at 1 Police Plaza, and made a formal harassment complaint against
the enemies he said were following him. As police procedures
dictate, an officer filed a report.
</P>
<P>
   At 2:45 p.m., security guards at the city's nearby Municipal
Building noticed a knapsack dropped on the sidewalk by a skinny,
agitated man who fled when they approached. The man was Perez,
investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   At 4 p.m. he was inside the criminal courthouse at 100 Centre
Street, outside a courtroom. Two court officers listened to his
tale of unhappy living conditions and people who stalked him. They
sent him on to the local police precinct.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators do not believe Perez went there. He was soon
seen descending the stairs to the No. 6 subway station at Canal
Street, and shortly before 5:45 p.m., when Rivera was pushed onto
the tracks, he was spotted again, by a token clerk at the 51st
Street station.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whole system failed,'' said a friend and fellow
veteran who lived in a storm sewer in Riverside Park when his
mental illness was out of control but now lives in the Times Square
Hotel, considered a model of supported housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``History is going to repeat itself,'' he said. ``I don't want
to see any more people hurt out there.''

HATCH CRITICIZES ADMINISTRATION'S HANDLING OF INTELLIGENCE
MATTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Orrin Hatch, the Utah Republican who last week
became the most recent candidate to enter the race for president,
on Sunday condemned the Clinton administration's handling of
intelligence affairs, saying, ``We're not taking counterterrorism
as seriously as we should.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on ``Fox News Sunday,'' Hatch offered a blunt response
to an article in The New York Times on Sunday that described how
senior White House officials were warned as early as 1995 that
China might have stolen nuclear secrets from the United States, but
failed to investigate aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   That ``really shouldn't go on,'' Hatch said. ``I'm sick of it.
That's one reason I'm running, and I'm going to change that.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, administration officials said they were launching a
wide-ranging review of the government's counterintelligence effort,
including revamping the FBI office that handles it. Coming after
revelations about Chinese scientific espionage, the review is a
tacit admission that the United States has not kept pace with
spying in the post-Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not putting the effort into it,'' said Hatch, who is a
member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and chairman of the
Judiciary Committee, which oversees the Justice Department and the
FBI. ``We're not putting the leadership into it.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The rest of the world depends on us. Let's do it.
Let's do what's right. And that's one thing I could bring to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said that raising money would be difficult. ``George Bush
seems to be scarfing up everything,'' he said, referring to the
Texas governor, who is the early leader among the Republican
contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to name a policy matter on which he and Bush disagree,
Hatch replied, ``I think probably we agree, by and large, you know,
on most things.'' But he sought to distinguish himself from both
Bush and the leading Democratic candidate, Vice President Al Gore,
by drawing attention to his working-class roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush and Al Gore have been born and raised in
privilege. I was not,'' said Hatch, 65, whose only public office is
the Senate seat he first won in 1976. ``I was born in a family that
was quite poor. In fact, I had to work my way through college. I
worked as a janitor.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would establish an exploratory committee, which would
enable him to begin raising money ``within the next week or so.''
And he said he planned to visit Iowa and New Hampshire, the states
with the earliest presidential contests, soon.

   BANK-CODES (Seattle) _ Olympia-based Heritage Bank gave the

identifiable without a special code. But one of Heritage's
customers, Albert Newman, was able to deciper the code. He was
outraged and ordered his bank not to give out the numbers. He

   LOS ANGELES _ Why do the Los Angeles Clippers even bother to
cross the road anymore?
</P>
<P>
   If it was to get to the other side, that'd be acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   But every time they're at a crossroads in the franchise, they
become like the car stuck in park on the train tracks, oblivious to
the gate coming down on its hood and the Amtrack Gold Coast bearing
down on the driver's side.
</P>
<P>
   They're damned if they do and damned if we know what they're
going to do next.
</P>
<P>
   So Baron Davis, the kid from Crossroads High before he abused
his privilege to attend UCLA, gets to engineer this time, bearing
down on his NBA future with the Clippers standing in the way of
everything.
</P>
<P>
   If he's lucky, Charlotte will take him No. 3 in Wednesday's
draft.
</P>
<P>
   If the Clippers are lucky, he'll be there at No.4 for them to
take.
</P>
<P>
   We'll be waiting at the other side with a tow truck and a
crowbar....
</P>
<P>
   __The last time the Clippers used a first-round pick to draft an
L.A.-area player was in ... let's see ... Bo Kimble, c'mon down!
That's still gotta sting....
</P>
<P>
   __One other scenario: The Clippers, who can't decide between
Northridge escapees Rico Harris and Greg Minor, take neither....
</P>
<P>

stayed there four years, this would have been his draft notice....

   __Note to Larry Johnson: Actually, yes, that !ital!is the same
UCLA pot-smoking hippie....
</P>
<P>
   __The new formula for the Bowl Championship Series that's
supposed to be released this week will likely include even more
computer rankings to be lumped in with the three they already use
from Jeff Sagarin, The New York Times and the Seattle Times. Wanna
use the UCLA Daily Bruin?....
</P>
<P>
   __In the past couple of weeks, USC's athletic department was 3-0
in court cases involving lawsuits filed against it by a former
academic aide, a former women's basketball coach and its former
broadcast partners. In media coverage of each case, the school _ in
particular, Mike Garrett _ took some pretty nasty hits from the
accusers, yet the school fought back, including debunking a Sports
Illustrated story that never printed.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   __The Kings announced they're starting the first hockey league _

   __Has the World Bowl '99 pregame show ended yet? ...
</P>

   __Asked recently by Sacramento Bee columnist Mark Kreidler how
he was coping with the struggles of a team he predicted would be
appearing in the World Series this fall, Dodgers GM Kevin Malone
said: ``There has been a lot of prayer time. I have been spending a

RETURNING REFUGEES WONDER ABOUT THE MISSING 
</HEADLINE>

 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LABJAN, Yugoslavia _ Milazim Kelmendi walked through the gate of
his house on Saturday and took his family completely by surprise.
They had last seen him on May 7 when he and dozens of other men
were taken away by Serb police, and were convinced he was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had had no news, whether he was dead, massacred, or what,''
his mother, Have Kelmendi, said Sunday. ``I wasn't this happy even
the day he was born.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were crying all the time, thinking he was dead,'' said his
younger brother.
</P>
<P>
   Pale and gaunt and with his head shaven, 26-year-old Milazim had
survived a month and a half in Serb prisons, first in the Kosovo
town of Pec and then in Zajecar in Serbia. ``He looks like they
have taken him out of the ground,'' his mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Milazim was one of 166 prisoners, all men, released by Serb
authorities two days ago from two prisons in Serbia, in the towns
of Leskovac and Zajecar. They had all been detained around May 7,
when trying to flee to Albania with their families. The men had
been separated from the women and children and marched away.
</P>
<P>
   Their release, which came unexpectedly, has ended the anguish
for some families and raised hopes for others still searching for
their relatives. The Serb prison authorities handed the men over to
representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross.
The director of one of the prisons said the men were being released
in a gesture of good will, said a Red Cross spokeswoman, Daloni
Carlisle.
</P>
<P>
   The release served as confirmation of the reports that Albanian
prisoners were being held in Serb prisons after being transferred
from Kosovo. The 166, who all came from the Pec region, in western
Kosovo, are probably just a small proportion of the total being
held in Serbia, aid agencies believe and some of those released
also say. And they are only a small fraction of the total number of
Albanians who remain missing from the war.
</P>
<P>
   Serb officials have told the Red Cross that they have a list of
2,070 people from Kosovo in their prisons. The officials have yet
to make such a list public, and it is not clear how comprehensive
it might be, but they have shown a list to some relatives seeking
news of missing men. They say the list is available to relatives,
but given the tension between Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo, many
Albanians may be hesitant to approach Serb officials to see it.
</P>
<P>
   The tally of missing Albanians may end up far higher. As
refugees are returning home to Kosovo, the authorities and aid
agencies are beginning to compile lists of missing people. Many are
feared to be dead.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is complicated since there is no clause in the
U.N. Security Council resolution on Kosovo covering the return of
prisoners, nor is there a mention in the military-technical
agreement signed by NATO and the Yugoslav army that ended the war.
</P>
<P>
   In the town of Djakovica and surrounding villages, in western
Kosovo, 1,500 local people already have been listed as missing. In
southern Kosovo, the German contingent of NATO forces has already
listed the names of 855 people reported missing in their area of
operations. The German sector is just one of five areas of control
that NATO forces oversee.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights organizations and members of the international war
crimes tribunal at The Hague, Netherlands, say it is too early to
estimate accurately how many people are missing or have been
killed, but they say they fear it will run to much more than a few
thousand. ``From driving around the province, my gut tells me it
could be 10,000,'' said one investigator.
</P>
<P>
   The prisons in Serbia are perhaps the source of the greatest
hope for finding men alive. They not only hold men arrested in
Kosovo, but Kosovo Albanians arrested in Montenegro and in Serbia
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Nine Kosovo Albanian students who had been in school in
Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, are thought to be in prisons there.
Five were arrested on May 2 and the others on May 13, said Natasa
Kandic of the Belgrade-based Center for Humanitarian Law, a
respected human rights group.
</P>
<P>
   All were close to graduation and model students, she said. They
had been studying to become doctors, veterinarians, pharmacists and
educators, and had stayed on in Belgrade after the war started,
intent on completing their studies.
</P>
<P>
   The five arrested on May 2 were later shown on state television,
along with an array of weapons. They were accused of being fighters
for the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army and of preparing some
terrorist action for public places in the capital. The other four
have not been heard of since their arrest, which was witnessed by a
fellow student. Police, prosecutors and prison authorities in
Belgrade have said they have no records of the second group, Ms.
Kandic said.
</P>
<P>
   The prospects of finding people who were abducted or who
disappeared during heavy fighting are even bleaker. Several people,
both Serbs and Kosovo Albanians, are thought to have been abducted
or killed by members of the rebel group.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carlisle, the Red Cross spokeswoman, said her agency has
lists of about 140 people who disappeared during the first year of
fighting in Kosovo and another group of a similar number who
disappeared over the last three months in the NATO bombing campaign
and increased violence.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel leaders have told the Red Cross they are not holding
anyone, but the organization is persisting in asking for details on
the missing, she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The lack of any agreement on the return of prisoners complicates
the work of organizations like the Red Cross to secure the release
of prisoners and will prolong the agony for many families, Ms.
Carlisle said.
</P>
<P>
   For the families still searching for news, the most agonizing
part is not knowing, they say. Fehmi Kuci pined away after her
husband was taken away by Serb forces in May. ``She shrank so much
that you could hold her in the palm of your hand,'' said her sister
Fitore Kelmendi, 19, in another household in the Kosovo town of
Labjan.
</P>
<P>
   When the prisoners arrived home Saturday, they did not bring
Fehmi's husband, Izet, but they brought news that they had seen him
and he was alive in a Serb prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday she was flying when she found out he was alive,''
Fitore Kelmendi said.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Xheva Kelmendi, said, ``We thought they had been
taken away and killed on a hill. We were so scared.'' As it was,
Ms. Kelmendi returned to find her husband's burned body inside
their charred house.
</P>
<P>
   The women of the family are hoping now that at least one of
their men might be returned to them. They had heard more prisoners
might be released in a week or two, but the fear and anguish still
kept its hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am scared that someone might kill them now,'' Fitore
Kelmendi said. ``Without seeing him with our own eyes, we are still
afraid.''

<P>
   MARRAKESH, Morocco _ As King Hassan II approached a royal gala
in the El-Badiaa palace recently, huge studded doors swung open,
guards in flowing white robes and red fezzes snapped to attention,
and guests erupted in resounding hurrahs: ``Long live his majesty
the king!''
</P>
<P>
   It is a tribute that has resonated even more strongly since the
death of Jordan's King Hussein in February made King Hassan, after
37 years on the throne, the Arab world's longest-surviving ruler.
But the tributes of the court have been shaded, too, with new
uncertainty ever since King Hassan, who is 69, sent his heir,
35-year-old Crown Prince Sidi Mohammed, to represent him at the
funeral of his fellow monarch and old friend in Amman, Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Although no official reason was given for the king's absence
from the Amman rites, palace aides acknowledged that the Moroccan
ruler, a victim of recurrent ill health, was unwell. His medical
problems continued into the spring, with other episodes that kept
him out of the public eye. But palace officials have denied
suggestions from Western diplomats that King Hassan is seriously
ill, describing his problems as an aggravated form of asthma.
</P>
<P>
   If the king is beginning to withdraw, it is with a stature among
Moroccans that is vastly transformed from his reputation as a
despot, renowned for heading a government that tortured political
foes and banished them for long years to grim desert forts.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, he has recast himself as the author of ``Hassanian
democracy,'' a hybrid that has widened political freedoms while
retaining the paramount political power of the Alawite dynasty that
the king heads.
</P>
<P>
   Among those hailing the monarch at the palace gala were Cabinet
ministers from left-wing parties who were appointed last year after
years under house arrest, in detention or in exile. Moroccan
officials have described the king's appointment of an
``opposition'' government composed of old adversaries, some of whom
once plotted to overthrow him, as a first for the Arab world, where
many governments continue to impose tight constraints on political
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Other examples of King Hassan's flexibility have included the
establishment of an elected lower house of parliament, in which
leftist parties gained the largest bloc of seats in elections in
1998. The king also ordered a ``cleanup'' of Morocco's human rights
record that has included the release of dozens of political
prisoners and _ another first for the Arab world _ $500-a-month
compensation payments to families of prisoners who disappeared or
died.
</P>
<P>
   With the leftist parties now co-opted into government, Islamic
radicals who have a strong power base on college campuses and among
millions of unemployed youths pose the most severe challenge.
</P>
<P>
   One aspect of the old political system that has not been
reformed are the restrictions on political activity by hard-line
Islamic parties, who are forbidden by the king to form political
parties or contest elections. Many Moroccans fear that these could
eventually cause an eruption that might overwhelm a less
experienced political leader.
</P>
<P>
   Such concerns have led Moroccans to focus new attention on
Prince Sidi Mohammed. The royal heir, like his father when he was
the crown prince, had a reputation as a playboy, more interested in
nightclubs, fast cars and other indulgences afforded by the royal
family's vast wealth than in affairs of state.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, as he began representing his father on important state
occasions, that reputation has begun to fade. But in a Muslim
society that emphasizes family ties, the crown prince has remained
unmarried past the age at which Moroccans start families.
</P>
<P>
   When King Hassan succeeded his father, King Mohammed V, who died
unexpectedly during minor surgery in 1961, the new king, then 31,
was regarded as ill suited to the task of governing an ancient,
often unruly kingdom that had gained independence only five years
before, after 44 years as a French protectorate. His success in
confounding his early detractors has encouraged court officials,
who predict that the same will be true for Prince Sidi Mohammed.
</P>
<P>
   The monarchy has been sustained by Moroccans' reverence for the
Alawite dynasty, which has provided the country's sultans since the
mid-17th century. Like his predecessors, King Hassan bears several
titles _ ``Commander of the Faithful,'' ``Savior'' and ``Shadow of
the Prophet on Earth'' _ that reflect the dynasty's claim to be
directly descended from the Muslim prophet Mohammed.
</P>
<P>
   King Hassan has been careful to foster his image as spiritual
leader, soliciting public donations to build a $500 million mosque
bearing his name beside the Atlantic coastline in the heart of
Casablanca, the country's main commercial center. Completed in
1990, the mosque features a powerful laser beam aimed at Mecca from
atop its 700-foot minaret.
</P>
<P>
   The king regularly lectures the ulema, or Muslim clergy, on
Islamic doctrine, and reminds the nation frequently that he is
``the person entrusted by God to lead you.''
</P>
<P>
   The king's claim to a pure Islamic bloodline poses a challenge
for Islamic radicals. Abdessalam Yassine, 70-year-old leader of the
largest radical organization, the Justice and Charity Movement, who
has been under house arrest for nine years, mocked the king in the
past as ``my dear nephew of the Prophet,'' but also noted that
Morocco is unique in having a ruler directly descended from
Mohammed.
</P>
<P>
   The king has his own wry riposte. ``Don't forget,'' he has said,
speaking of the radicals, ``that I am a fundamentalist, too.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Beyond his dynastic authority, even the king's critics credit
him with political astuteness for surviving in a region that had
become, by the 1960s, deeply hostile to monarchy. In 1962, rebels
in Algeria, Morocco's closest neighbor, won their independence war
with France and set out to make Algeria a socialist state.
</P>
<P>
   Other Arab monarchs _ Egypt's King Farouk in 1956, Iraq's King
Faisal in 1958, and Libya's King Idris in 1969 _ fell to rebellions
inspired by Arab socialism and pan-Arab nationalism, then the
dominant political passions of the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   In his early years, the Moroccan ruler survived several
attempted coups. In 1971, 1,400 soldiers opened fire on his
birthday reception, killing 100 guests but missing the king, who
hid in a bathroom. The following year, Moroccan air force jets
attempted unsuccessfully to shoot his Boeing 727 plane down as it
carried the monarch home from a trip to France.
</P>
<P>
   After the failed coups, the defense minister, Gen. Mohammed
Oufkir, was shot, and 30 officers were confined in a notorious
desert fortress, Tazmamert, where they were tortured and died.
Oufkir's wife and six young children had their Rabat home razed
before being carried off to 25 years of desert banishment and house
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   In the same uncompromising manner, the king waved aside
international protests in 1975 and sent troops to occupy the
contested territory of Western Sahara, precipitating a 16-year war
with the pro-independence guerrillas of the Polisario Front. After
an eight-year truce and accumulated costs for Morocco that cabinet
ministers estimate at $20 billion, about equal to a national debt
that is among the highest for any Arab country, the dispute remains
unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   But the king's admirers say the most important decisions he made
were the things he did not do. Unlike many developing nations,
Morocco was never a one-party state. While Algeria and many other
Arab states adopted Soviet-style central planning, King Hassan
opted for a market economy. From the start, he retained close ties
to the West, making Morocco the odd man out in north Africa, where
Soviet influence was strong.
</P>
<P>
   He was also an early advocate of peace between Arab states and
Israel, making secret diplomatic overtures in the early 1970s, when
much of the Arab world was nursing the wounds of the 1967 war. U.S.
diplomats credited him with easing the way to the 1979 Camp David
accords, and he has played host to visiting Israeli prime
ministers.
</P>
<P>
   After shunning the right-wing government of Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, he used a recent visit of 50 Israeli
parliamentarians to signal a readiness to push for peace again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, many of the choices the king made at an early stage of
his reign look very obvious, but they weren't then,'' said Andre
Azoulay, a Moroccan who made a career as a prominent Paris banker
before returning in the mid-1990s to serve as the king's financial
adviser. ``Now, we can qualify him as a visionary, well ahead of
his time.''
</P>
<P>
   Much will depend now on the new political system. A new
constitution in 1996 created a fully elected lower house of
parliament for the first time. But the king retains ultimate
authority, with wide powers to dismiss individual cabinet ministers
or entire governments, to dissolve parliament, to veto legislation,
and even to rule by decree.
</P>
<P>
   He also presides at Cabinet meetings, appoints all senior civil
servants, and remains commander-in-chief of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Under a deal worked out last year, after elections resulted in
the appointment as prime minister of Abderrahman Youssoufi, a
74-year-old socialist who spent 15 years in exile, the king
appointed his own loyalists to the ministries of foreign affairs,
justice, interior and Islamic affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The most powerful man in the country, after the king, remains
Driss Basri, the interior minister, a palace hard-liner accused of
authorizing widespread abuses against the king's political
opponents during his 20 years in the post.
</P>
<P>
   After 20 months in office, the Youssoufi government has prompted
grumbling among ordinary Moroccans who hoped for swifter action on
the country's social problems. These include widespread illiteracy,
unsafe drinking water in the villages, and unemployment so severe
that dozens drown in the straits of Gibraltar each year attempting
to migrate illegally to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Youssoufi has said that the government's hands are tied by tight
constraints on the national budget. With nearly 85 per cent of
outlays going to government salaries and payments on the national
debt, there is little left for social spending. But being in the
government makes it difficult to blame the country's woes on the
king. ``We have the responsibilities, but not the power,'' one
former communist serving in the Youssoufi government said
dolefully. ``It's not an ideal arrangement.''
</P>
<P>
   The growing restiveness makes fertile ground for the Islamic
radicals. Abdelwahad Motaouwakil, a spokesman for Justice and
Charity, the largest Islamic movement, predicts that Moroccans will
eventually tire of ``Hassanian democracy'' and embrace a society
based on the Koran. ``The Youssoufi government is the king's last
card,'' he has said. ``It's bound to fail.''

TOUGH YEAR IS PROJECTED FOR FARMS OF RUSSIA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A blisteringly hot summer and the reverberations from
Russia's economic crisis have taken a devastating toll on the
nation's crops, making it likely that Moscow will appeal for
American food aid, according to Russian and American officials.
</P>
<P>
   Russia had hoped to harvest 70 million tons of grain this year.
But Western experts estimate that Russian farms will yield no more
than 55 million tons.
</P>
<P>
   The setback comes on the heels of last year's harvest, at 47.8
million tons, the worst in Russia in more than 40 years. Instead of
the turnaround in food production the Kremlin had hoped for,
Russian government officials have begun to prepare the public for
another tough year.
</P>
<P>
   While formal talks on additional aid have not yet begun,
Agriculture Minister Vladimir Shcherbak told reporters last week
that Moscow wanted America to donate animal feed, like soybeans,
soy meal and maize.
</P>
<P>
   By using donated feed to sustain its cattle, Russia would have
more grain available to feed people. The government also hopes to
sell the donated animal feed at home and use the proceeds to
improve agricultural production, Shcherbak told Reuters news
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Entering a superheated political year, the Kremlin has powerful
political incentives to try to keep Russian consumers and farmers
happy _ or at least to make them somewhat less unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Communists will be angling to expand their control
over the legislature when parliamentary elections are held in
December.
</P>
<P>
   Next, candidates will be maneuvering to succeed Boris Yeltsin in
presidential elections scheduled for next summer, and Yeltsin has
taken a strong interest in determining his successor.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's food needs are an important political factor in the
United States, as well. Expanded food aid to Russia would be a boon
to the American farmer, a consideration for the Democrats as they
seek to keep control of the White House next year.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has agreed to provide 3.2 million tons of
grain, meat and other food to Russia. Much of the approximately
$700 million worth of food was donated, while the remainder was
financed by a 20-year loan at nominal interest. Washington also
footed the transportation costs, bringing the total value of the
aid effort to around $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But with American stocks of grain, beef and pork at near-record
levels, the Clinton administration is ready to provide even more
help.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons why Russia has failed to produce enough
food. The collective farms established during the Soviet Union have
been reorganized more in name than in fact. Last year's financial
crisis impeded the already lagging investments in seed, fertilizer,
animal feed and farm equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Russia was hit by another spell of bad weather. The
scorchingly hot and dry weather so far this summer has been
particularly severe in southern Russia along the Volga River, an
important agricultural region. Russia's Agriculture Ministry had
initially hoped for 70 million tons this year.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, however, the estimates have been revised downward.
Shcherbak, the agriculture minister, said last week the grain
harvest may yield only 55 million to 60 million tons.
</P>
<P>
   Some Western specialists say even that is too optimistic. One
expert said Russia would likely harvest no more than 53 million to
55 million tons of grain. Of that, no more than 30 million tons
would be wheat.
</P>
<P>
   Russia could use some of its better-quality feed grain to
sustain Russian consumers instead of cattle. That, however, could
hurt livestock production, which has been steadily decreasing.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing has to give: food or feed,'' a Western expert said.
``They need support to make ends meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Grain reserves have been depleted in the effort to make up last
year's grain shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves food aid, which Russia's former agriculture
minister, Gennady Kulik, raised informally during talks in
Washington in March. His successor, Shcherbak, apparently alluded
to those proposals in his comments last week. Sensitive to wounded
Russian pride, however, he insisted it not be called aid.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is also sensitive to potential
political risks of further aid, in particular charges that it would
be undermined by Russian corruption. Now that more than one-third
of the promised 3.2 million tons have been delivered without
allegations of major abuse, Washington appears ready to discuss
further assistance.

CLINTON TO UNVEIL PLAN FOR FIXING SOCIAL SECURITY, USING BUDGET
SURPLUSES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON with ADAM CLYMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Setting up a new round of intense budget
negotiations with Republicans in Congress, President Clinton is
completing work on a proposal encompassing ideas for shoring up
Social Security and using larger than anticipated federal budget
surpluses, administration officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The White House declined to provide details of the proposal,
which Clinton is likely to unveil on Monday, a day before he sets
out a separate strategy for overhauling Medicare, the health
insurance system for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   But officials said the new plan would include a component
intended to extend Social Security's solvency, though not to the
full 75 years that has long been the benchmark for the system's
financial health. Without any changes, Social Security will run
short of money to pay full retirement benefits starting in 2034,
following the retirement of the 76-million strong baby boom
generation.
</P>
<P>
   The plan's release could signal a new willingness on the part of
the White House to consider a broader bipartisan deal on taxes and
spending even if Social Security's problems are not fully dealt
with. Until now, Clinton has stuck adamantly to a demand he first
made a year and a half ago, that the surplus be off limits until
the retirement system's future has been assured.
</P>
<P>
   But efforts to bring Republicans and Democrats together on a
full fix for Social Security are all but dead in Congress. And with
the White House and Congress about to release separate new
projections showing that budget surpluses will be even bigger than
expected in coming years, both parties have been seeking ways to
put the additional money to their priorities without allowing the
other to paint them as fiscally irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proposal is expected to specify how he would like to
use the bigger surplus, which is being generated largely by the
strong economy. The new White House budget projections are likely
to show that the federal government could run an operating surplus
next year, a year earlier than expected, meaning that it would
spend less than it takes in even without including excess Social
Security payroll taxes, which have erased the deficit in the last
several years.
</P>
<P>
   The growth in the surplus, and especially any early shift to a
surplus not dependent on Social Security, would bring renewed calls
from Republicans for tax cuts. It would also bring pressure from
members of both parties to ease tight spending restrictions put in
place over the last decade, when budget politics was built on
deficit reduction rather than competing visions of how to use the
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   In putting forward a new budget proposal, Clinton is effectively
putting down a marker for what is expected to be several months of
intense partisan maneuvering over tax and spending policy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's new plan includes a revised version of a proposal that
the two parties have been jockeying over in Congress for the past
several months: a ``lock box'' to ensure that the excess Social
Security revenues are not spent, but used only to reduce the
national debt or ensure the retirement system's long-term
viability.
</P>
<P>
   In his original budget proposal in January, Clinton proposed
reserving 62 percent of the budget surplus over 15 years for Social
Security, but in a way that would allow him to spend a portion of
the Social Security surplus in the next few years. Both parties
have rejected that approach, and although they differ on details,
have basically endorsed setting aside every dollar of each year's
Social Security surplus.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said their new plan would respond to the
Congressional criticism, and would also include a provision that
would link reducing the national debt to improving Social
Security's long-term financial condition. The administration's
original attempt to do that in its January budget was built around
a complex proposal under which the benefits of reducing the
national debt would have been funneled to Social Security in the
form of new government bonds, an approach that Republicans
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the new plan would attempt to
reach the same end by different means.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very hopeful that the new presidential proposal _ that
new Social Security lock box _ will be a way of bringing together
both Democrats and Republicans,'' Gene Sperling, the director of
the White House's National Economic Council, told CNN's Late
Edition Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of Clinton's ``Social Security first'' strategy,
the degree to which the two parties can agree on tax and spending
priorities seems largely to depend on whether they can make enough
progress on shoring up the retirement system to give them political
cover for using the surplus for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   With their efforts to pass spending bills in danger because of
the tight spending caps _ and with Clinton likely to veto the $775
billion, 10-year tax cut they have in mind _ Republican leaders
have increasingly been banking on a budget windfall to help avoid
gridlock. Speaker Dennis Hastert said last week that he expected to
use promptly any non-Social Security surpluses that become
available.
</P>
<P>
   But there are several different sets of ideas of what to do with
any windfall. Congressional Republicans will say it underlines the
good sense of tax cuts. Clinton indicated Friday he would use the
money as a way to help deal with both Medicare and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   But House Democrats openly _ and many Republicans quietly _ see
new good news on the budget as the only way out of a spending box
they built for themselves in 1997. Then, they set tight caps on the
amount of money Congress could spend on the military and on
domestic programs other than Social Security, Medicare, welfare and
other so-called entitlement programs.

GODINA DELIVERS THREE WORLD BESTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KIRBY LEE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. _ Who could blame John Godina for feeling a little
tired in the last three rounds of the shot put in the USA Track and
Field Championships on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Godina produced the three longest throws in the world this year
to open the competition, including a career-best 72 feet, 3 inches
en route to his second national title in a row before a Hayward
Field crowd of 8,913.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a little worn out from celebrating,'' said Godina, who
finished second in the discus Saturday. ``I don't know if I should
have done that so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Godina's exceeded his previous best by three-quarters of an
inch. In addition, his winning effort marked the first time the
two-time defending world champion had broken 72 feet since Godina
captured the world title and NCAA championships as a UCLA senior in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   C.J. Hunter, the husband of Marion Jones, finished second at
69-2{ and Kevin Toth was third at 66-11\. The top three finishers
advance to the World Championships in Seville, Spain, in August.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who finished second in the long jump Friday, rebounded
from her first defeat to an American since 1997, winning the 200 in
22.10.
</P>
<P>
   Godina, who trains under UCLA weight coach Art Venegas with the
Reebok-Bruin Track Club, opened with a put of 71-8\, improved to
72-3 in the second round and followed it with a mark of 70-9 on his
third attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Godina shared the spotlight with pole vaulter Jeff Hartwig on
the final day of the four-day meet. Hartwig cleared 19-9 to break
his own American record by half an inch. He took three tries at
6.10 meters in an attempt to become the first American to clear 20
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Greene won the 200 in the absence of world-record holder
Michael Johnson, who withdrew because of a quadriceps injury.
Greene clocked a wind-aided 19.93 to edge world indoor champion
Rohsaan Griffin by 5/100s of a second despite stumbling out of the
blocks at the start.
</P>
<P>
   Regina Jacobs became the first woman to win the 1,500 and 5,000
in the same year and wound up the meet's only double winner.
</P>
<P>
   The 1981 graduate of Argyll Academy (now Campbell Hall) clocked
15:24.80 to win the 5,000 for the second year in a row, going 29.8
for the final 200 and 2:12.6 for the last 800 to pull away from
Cheri Kenah (15:26.60) and Elva Dryer (15:27.26). On Saturday
night, Jacobs won her eighth national title in the 1,500. Amy
Skieresz, an Agoura graduate and a seven-time NCAA champion in
cross country and track at Arizona, was ninth in 16:00.33.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Crear of Valencia and Gail Devers won the 110 high hurdles
and 100 hurdles in wind-aided marks of 13.09 and 12.54, the fastest
time in the world under any conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Gray of Agoura Hills, 39, came up short in his bid for
his eighth national 800 title, finishing fourth in 1:46.62 in a
race won by Santa Monica Track Club teammate Khadevis Robinson in
1:45.92.

MEDICARE DRUG-BENEFIT PLAN TO BE UNVEILED THIS WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Donna Shalala, the secretary of health and human
services, moved on Sunday to head off criticism of the cost of
President Clinton's plan to help buy prescription drugs for older
Americans, saying that the new Medicare benefits ``will not be as
generous as people think.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about just adding some new lush benefit,'' Shalala
said on CBS News' ``Face the Nation.'' ``This is critical to health
care.''
</P>
<P>
   More than one-third of the 39 million Medicare beneficiaries
have no insurance to cover prescription-drug costs. On Tuesday,
Clinton will unveil a plan for the government to offer subsidized
drug coverage to all beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The plan depends, in its entirety, on approval by Congress. It
is impossible to predict with any certainty what Congress will do.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the premium for drug coverage
would start in the range of $20 to $25 a month and then climb
gradually in subsequent years toward $45 a month. Under the plan,
the government would pay about half the cost of prescription drugs,
up to a certain level to be specified by law, and beneficiaries
would pay the remainder.
</P>
<P>
   As of noon Sunday, an administration official said, the maximum
annual benefit _ the amount payable by the government _ had not
been decided. But like the premium, it could rise over time, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Comments by Clinton and his aides suggest that the
administration is open to a deal with Congress: Democrats would win
Medicare coverage of prescription drugs, and Republicans would get
some of the tax cuts they want.
</P>
<P>
   John Podesta, the White House chief of staff, met last week with
Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, who is chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee, where tax bills usually originate.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Archer said he tried to keep the meeting secret because
he feared it would feed the suspicions of liberal House Democrats
who worry that Clinton will cut a deal with Republicans in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Shalala said the cost of Medicare drug coverage would not ``spin
out of control,'' but she refused to say how it would be financed.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sperling, the White House economic adviser, said the cost
to taxpayers would be manageable. ``The reason why it is going to
cost very little is because the plan overall is going to include
significant savings in the Medicare plan,'' he said on CNN's ``Late
Edition.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said Clinton's proposal would save
large amounts of money by extending provisions of the Balanced
Budget Act of 1997, which cut Medicare payments to most health-care
providers.
</P>
<P>
   That idea is sure to meet fierce opposition from doctors,
hospitals, nursing homes and home health-care agencies, which are
lobbying Congress to restore money cut in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter last week to Republican lawmakers, Rep. Bill Thomas
of California, one of the party's leading experts on health policy,
suggested questions that should be raised about Clinton's drug
plan.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Thomas asked: ``Is it targeted to individuals that
need coverage? Does it give a benefit to those who already have
coverage, possibly jeopardizing the munificent benefits they
already receive? Would the benefit be available to retired
millionaires who do not need assistance?''
</P>
<P>
   Under Clinton's plan, insurance for drug expenses would be
offered to all Medicare beneficiaries, including those who now have
such coverage from former employers. The government would also
offer subsidies to employers to encourage them to continue
providing drug benefits to retirees, perhaps to supplement
Medicare's coverage.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A lobbyist for a large labor union said: ``A lot of employers
may decide they're better off putting their people into the
Medicare drug program. Employers could pick up drug costs that
Medicare does not cover, and they might pay the premium for
Medicare drug benefits too.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Kaplan, vice president of Segal Co., an employee benefits
consulting concern based in New York City, said, ``Anything the
government does to pick up prescription-drug expenses under
Medicare could provide a windfall for private employers, unions and
state and local governments that offer retiree health coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   If Medicare covers prescription drugs, Kaplan said, employers
might curtail retiree health benefits or might try to control
rapidly rising costs by giving retirees a lump sum of cash, which
the retirees could use to buy private health insurance.

COMMENTARY: FREE PILLS FOR GEEZERS? 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Free milk for babies'' was the battle cry of
social reformers a century ago. Today the bumper sticker of those
pressing for inclusion of prescription drugs in Medicare might read
``Free Pills for Geezers.''
</P>
<P>
   (I'll get mail from members of my age cohort whining about
``geezer'' as a demographic slur, but it's no more pejorative than
``young whippersnapper.'')
</P>
<P>
   Just as free milk was good for youngsters, free pills will be
good for indigent oldsters. Medication, especially in geriatric and
psychiatric treatment, is often better and always cheaper than
hospitalization. Insurance coverage of most prescriptions for the
aging is an idea whose time has come; the only question is how best
to pay for it without more speedily bankrupting Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few days ago, the White House had its answer: Sock the
middle class and wealthy in Medicare with a bigger premium to cover
the costs of prescriptions for poor people. Through a ``means
test,'' Mr. Clinton would be Dr. Robin Hood.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in Congress popped that trial balloon in a hurry.
Raise premiums on the old folks? Political suicide. Republicans
agreed, asking why retirees who saved and invested to build a nest
egg all their lives should be penalized for their prudence by
becoming targets of a tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   After some frantic scrambling, Clinton came up with a fallback
plan to be announced Tuesday. How, without a new premium increase,
do you add a prescription benefit to Medicare, which already faces
insolvency in eight years?
</P>
<P>
   His answer: out of the pocket of the taxpayer. According to
Robert Pear, who consistently comes to work earlier than anyone in
the New York Times Washington bureau, ``Medicare would get a huge
infusion of cash from the federal treasury: $700 billion,
representing about 15 percent of federal budget surpluses
anticipated over the next 15 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Stipulate that a new benefit will never be taken back. Remember
that all official projections of federal deficits and surpluses for
the past 15 years have been wildly mistaken. Then ask: Can we be
sure that the business cycle will become an arrow straight upward,
that no tax reduction will ever be needed to stimulate a faltering
economy _ in essence, that Miss America is Rosy Scenario?
</P>
<P>
   Optimism is in, but to base the solvency of Medicare on the
willingness of the next generation of taxpayers to subsidize a
planned, ever-increasing tide of red ink is more than a little
risky.
</P>
<P>
   Beware reliance on a permanent surplus. Twenty years from now,
the children of today's boomers might not want to carry the heavy
tax burden to support a generation that bet on the come,
irresponsibly refusing to plan ahead to insure itself.
</P>
<P>
   Beware, too, of killing the goose that lays the golden pills.
The most troubling two words in the Clinton 80-minute news ramble
touched on the prescription drugs to be dispensed under Medicare:
They had to be ``properly priced.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Washington to decide on what price is ``proper'' for a new
drug? It's fine for government to help negotiate volume discounts
for purchases, but destructive to snatch the pricing function from
the free market.
</P>
<P>
   If Medicare listens to demagogic complaints about greedy profits
for the latest pharmaceuticals and dictates the price it will pay,
private investment risking its capital in discovering new
treatments will dry up. Take it from one who wrote Nixon's speech
imposing price controls; they don't work.
</P>
<P>
   How, then, do we make it possible now for a poor Pop to pop a
pill? It's not rocket science and requires no universe-wide
government takeover of the health care system.
</P>
<P>
   Months ago, the bipartisan Breaux-Thomas Medicare commission
came up with a sensible plan of premium support that would help
Medicare recipients pay for a health plan of their choosing. It's
not ``free pills for all,'' but it's similar to the generous
federal-employee plan, and the better-off can buy more benefits.
What's needed now is to add a prescription-drug benefit to the
basic benefits package.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stiffed the commission's proposals: not expensive
enough, provided no political issue, and the Clinton name was not
on them.
</P>
<P>
   But it's practical and doable this year. If you want
prescriptions covered through Medicare, raise your voice, Gramps.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KRAGUJEVAC, Yugoslavia, _ Behind a door without a doorknob, in a
filthy school basement lighted by a single bare bulb, nine homeless
Serbs offered themselves Sunday as human report cards on Slobodan
Milosevic's crusade to cut a ``Greater Serbia'' from the ruins of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nine years in hell. That's my life,'' explained Radovan Grtic,
who came to the basement two days ago, after fleeing Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Grtic and the eight other Serbs in the room were all born in the
former Yugoslav republic of Croatia. That's where Milosevic's
nationalist schemes turned them into destitute wanderers,
threatened with death when they lived outside of Serbia and hustled
off to the hinterlands when they attempted to live inside its
borders.
</P>
<P>
   They have been chased from Croatia by the Croatian army, then
hustled out of Serbia by Serbian police, then chased out of Kosovo
by vengeful Albanians and finally washed up here on the outskirts
of this down-on-its-luck factory town in central Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Due to NATO bombing during the Kosovo war, the sprawling Zastava
car and weapons plant that was the dominant employer in Kragujevac
has been ruined. The 6,000 Kosovo Serbs who have fled to this city
in the past two weeks are joining a local population of about
150,000 people for whom unemployment is epidemic and where local
journalists say the major economic activity is smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   The dismal travels of the Serbs in the basement are a useful
guide in deciphering what three ethnic wars have wrought for the
two million or so Serbs who lived outside of the Serbia when
Milosevic came to power in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a clever man,'' said Grtic, who was a farmer before
he fled Croatia and a gravedigger before he fled Kosovo. ``But I
can see that my homeland in Croatia is not a part of Serbia. The
Serbs in Bosnia are not part of Serbia. Kosovo is not a part of
Serbia. Maybe next year, I think, it will be bloody all over
Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Serbs in the school basement, the war that led to their
first forced exodus began with a quick and rather intoxicating
series of victories, as have all three of Milosevic's military
adventures in Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The post-Yugoslav Serbian Empire that Milosevic forcibly created
reached its territorial peak in the autumn and winter of 1992, the
fruit of Serb offensives, first in Croatia in 1991 and in Bosnia
the following year.
</P>
<P>
   That empire controlled about a third of Croatia and 70 percent
of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo, then, was constitutionally entitled to be an autonomous
province inside Serbia, where the Albanian majority would govern
most of their own affairs. But that autonomy had been crushed by
Serbian police and Yugoslav army forces.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's empire, however, lasted just three months at its
territorial fullest. It has been shrinking spasmodically ever since
_ most visibly this month when 21,000 NATO forces poured into
Kosovo, in effect, shearing it off from Serbia, which is the
dominant republic inside what is left of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The shrinkage started in Croatia in January of 1993, when the
Croatian army took back some strategic towns in the Krajina region.
The big loss, though, took place in August of 1995, when the Croats
launched an invasion that violently and, often savagely, pushed
about 200,000 Serbs out of Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   Grtic, then 19 years old and living in the scenic village of
Dvor Na Uni in eastern Croatia, was a farmer and Serb militiaman
when he learned the Croats were coming. He said he walked away from
his home and then hopped a truck.
</P>
<P>
   In a couple of weeks, he said, he found himself in the western
Serb town of Valjevo, which he liked and where he wanted to stay
and build a life.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, thinking back, I most blame the Serb police who forced
me to leave Valjevo,'' Grtic said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was forced to ``volunteer'' to be a settler in
Kosovo, a territory that Kosovar Serbs had been fleeing from for
decades because of conflicts there with the growing ethnic Albanian
population. The Milosevic regime, having risen to power on promises
of maintaining control in Kosovo, which many Serbs regard as their
holy land, tried to pressure Serb refugees from Croatia and from
Bosnia to move to the poor and mostly rural province.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, only a few thousand Serbs, mostly poor people
without any family or business connection inside Serbia, were
unable to figure out a way not to go to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Grtic was among those who had no alternative but to do as Serb
officials instructed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me I would be given a house in Kosovo and a job,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived in the Kosovo city of Pec, however, Grtic was
taken to a resettlement center, where he spent nearly four years
sharing a room 14 other displaced Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Down in the basement Sunday, Juba Tesla, 48, a Serb farmer who
lay on a bed surrounded by his wife and four children, told a
similar story of being elbowed out of Serbia in 1995 after Croats
from his birthplace in the Krajina region of Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Croats were coming, we ran away,'' said Tesla, who
drove out of Croatia in a tractor, pulling a wagon loaded with his
family and his life's possessions. ``In Bosnia, we were led to a
train and I went to sleep thinking that I would wake up in
Belgrade.''
</P>
<P>
   Tesla, though, woke up in Kosovo, where he was encouraged by
Serb authorities to settle in the town of Dzurakovac, not far from
Pec. He worked there for nearly four years as day laborer, until
NATO's 11-week war with Yugoslavia over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   During the war, when hundreds of thousands of Albanians fled
Kosovo and many thousands were killed by Serb forces, Tesla and
Grtic said they took no part in forcing the Albanians to flee. But
they also made it clear that they were not especially upset to see
them go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serbs have had enough of the Albanians,'' said Grtic. ``Serbs
have suffered from them since 1389.'' He referred to the fateful
Battle of Kosovo, which was won by the Ottoman Turks but is
regarded by the history-obsessed Serbs as a glorious show of
courage in defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Grtic said he was aware that atrocities were committed by Serbs
against Albanians in Pec and he thought it was prudent to get out
of town before their angry relatives and friends came back.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived here in Kragujevac with a suitcase and, he said, no
idea of where he was going to go now or what he was going to do.
Asked who he blames for his multiple exiles inside the former
Yugoslavia, Grtic grunted, ``Slobo,'' the popular name of
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took Serb forces out of Kosovo. It is not safe for me to
live there. He allowed the Albanians everything they wanted,''
Grtic said.
</P>
<P>
   On a basement bed next to Grtic, Tesla was not willing to single
out any politician. He said he blamed the leaders of Croatia,
Bosnia and Serbia equally. But he said he and his family were not
angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not angry, we are desperate,'' he said. ``We haven't
got the energy for anger. We don't know long we will have to
travel.''

<P>
   PORTERVILLE, Calif. _ When winter threw a fit last Christmas,
slamming through the Central Valley and scaring the life out of the
citrus groves, people here were sure 1999 was over.
</P>
<P>
   It was. By the time the ice storms backed off four days later,
the orange and lemon crops were nearly gone and so were the picking
and packing jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The freeze destroyed more than $700 million worth of produce in
the Central Valley, the United States' largest food producer,
including more than 75 percent of the valley's navel oranges, about
83 percent of its Valencia oranges and virtually all the lemons.
The storms left from 14,000 to 28,000 farm workers unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   More than half a year later, with the sunlight pressing on the
valley like a hot compress, the damage from the freeze is getting
worse. Growers and packing-house owners are up to their chins in
debt; workers are up to their eyes in it.
</P>
<P>
   To see the dusty towns in freeze-struck counties like Tulare,
which grows many of the nation's navel oranges, one would never
know that this nation is richer than ever. People stand in long
lines for boxes of free government-issued food _ white cans with
big black letters that say ``pork,'' ``peaches'' and ``peas.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people are moving from houses and apartments into decrepit
trailers, to save on rent. Others have pulled up stakes, packing
their children and setting out in pickup trucks to hunt down jobs:
two weeks picking cherries in Stockton; two weeks working the
strawberry fields in Oregon. Then maybe on to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Even in good times, the Central Valley's core, from Stockton to
Bakersfield, is a vivid reminder that there are swaths of this
country where families must literally count their pennies.
Unemployment in Tulare County, where the freeze hit hardest,
usually hovers around 15 percent, more than 40 percent in some
towns.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a long time to recover from one fierce display of
nature. Unemployment is now more than 20 percent countywide _ 50
percent in some rural areas. Most people do not expect life to
return to normal again until the navel orange harvest begins in
late fall, or to fully recover for at least another year.
</P>
<P>
   The last freeze struck in 1990, and people say they are still
recovering from that one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to leave this time,'' said Victor Espinoza, who said
he had spent 25 years working the lemon and orange orchards of
Tulare County. Sitting in his front yard in Porterville, a town the
freeze laid flat on its back, he said he was stir-crazy after
nearly seven months without work. He has a wife and teen-age
daughter to support, and he has bills to pay, same as everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to go to Stockton or Washington,'' he said. ``But
friends said: `Don't bother. There are too many workers, working
too little.'''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Porterville, which has 37,000 residents, thousands of
ruined oranges _ their insides like little straw balls _ lie strewn
all over the groves. Nearly everyone depends on the crops one way
or another. If they do not grow, ship, pick or pack, their
customers do. So downtown, J.C. Penney, the multiplex movie theater
and the Cookie Jar Cafe are all eerily empty.
</P>
<P>
   Agencies, government and otherwise, have helped. The Federal
Emergency Management Agency has handed out $4.6 million in mortgage
and rental assistance to more than 2,700 workers. The state
Legislature, after lobbying by nonprofit community organizations
and the United Farm Workers, temporarily increased the maximum
amount a worker can earn and still receive unemployment benefits
from $25 a week to $200 so that workers called for a few hours will
not lose more by working than by collecting $150 unemployment
checks.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture is providing food to affected
workers, as are churches and private food pantries. The state has
handed out grants. Small numbers of workers have obtained temporary
community-service jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But the aid has not reached everyone, or even most people. Most
of the out-of-work laborers are immigrants, some legal, some not.
``There are some enormous cracks'' in the system said James Gordon,
the chief executive officer of Proteus, a nonprofit community
organization in Visalia that has a contract from federal and local
governments to provide freeze relief.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, men who have not registered for selective
service are not eligible for emergency aid, though many are
immigrants who arrived in the United States after age 26 or who
never knew about the selective-service requirement.
</P>
<P>
   During the last freeze, changes in welfare laws meant that
undocumented workers, who make up an estimated 50 percent of the
pickers, could no longer receive emergency aid. Even some people
with legal work permits have been too intimidated to apply for
help.
</P>
<P>
   Guadalupe Arceo, a 30-year-old mother of three, is one of those.
Ms. Arceo, who is separated from her husband, has neither worked
nor received any aid this year. When she applied for rental
assistance, she said, she was told _ wrongly, relief workers say _
that she might hurt her application for permanent-resident status
because the Immigration and Naturalization Service would not look
kindly on applicants who might be a public burden.
</P>
<P>
   Although eligible, Ms. Arceo has never applied for food stamps
or aid for her children, ages 3 to 11. Since December, she has paid
the $280 rent for her apartment in a public housing project with
loans from relatives. Last month, she said, they told her their
money had run out.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Ms. Arceo says she will have to move to New York City to
get a job to pay her bills. After eking out a life here so that her
children could be happy, it is her only choice, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll live with my brother's family in Manhattan through the
summer, make enough to pay the rent here and more, and come back
when the season starts again in November,'' she said, plane tickets
in hand. ``I don't see any other remedy.''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Grape workers are also in trouble because they are not eligible
for any freeze relief, even though they, too, were affected. Many
of their jobs were taken when labor contractors replaced them with
laid-off citrus workers willing to work for minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio and Melania Gomez, who have spent more than 20 years
picking grapes in Tulare County, and who scraped together enough
money to buy a little house in Porterville nine years ago, have
barely worked three weeks this year. Their bills are stuffed into a
letter holder in their living room, months of utility bills, not
including the high-interest loans they have taken from
acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   Their bank, they said, told them that it would turn them over to
a collection agency if they missed just one mortgage payment, and
they were turned down by every agency they asked for help. They
cannot receive welfare (``Not that we've ever wanted that!'' Mrs.
Gomez said) because they own a house. It is a very humble house, in
a poor neighborhood, but a house nonetheless. They are raising a
3-year-old grandson, but they receive no aid for him because they
are not his legal guardians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I beg,'' Mrs. Gomez said, blushing deep red, as her husband
left the room to get Cokes for his guests. ``I drive to the nearby
towns, stand on the corners and put out my hand. I stand on line
for food and I stand on corners for money, because otherwise we
would starve, and we would sleep on the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   The grape harvest, which was supposed to begin again in the
first week of July, has been delayed a week or more by a mid-April
cold snap. The Gomezes worry that all the extra laborers will
finish the season's work early and they will never catch up on
their debts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are so disillusioned that we're putting the house up for
sale,'' Mrs. Gomez said.
</P>
<P>
   Some workers are relatively lucky. Mirna Gonzalez, who earned a
reasonable living working in a large packing house, is one of 16
citrus workers now employed as temporary community organizers for
the National Farmworkers Service Center. The group offers advice to
workers and, with the state Department of Social Services and
Foodlink, a nonprofit organization, distributes food boxes in 32
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gonzalez's husband, also a citrus worker, is one of 8,000
laid-off workers collecting unemployment. ``When I visit other
families,'' Mrs. Gonzalez said, ``especially those who are not
documented and are not getting any help, I think we're very
lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   The workers who live in the worst conditions are in shedlike
cement buildings, 12 men to one house, and in trailer parks where
chickens and pigeons roam on the pitted dirt roads.
</P>
<P>
   Ramona Martinez, an undocumented citrus worker, has spent eight
years picking oranges while living in a one-bedroom trailer with
her husband, three sons and her 68-year-old mother. She said the
family was starting to earn enough to move up. But that hope was
wiped out by the freeze. She and her husband, who are both trying
to become legal workers, pay their $200 rent with money they
receive in aid for their American-born children, and they buy food
with $150 a month in food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   The husband, also an orange picker, has just taken a two-week
job as a mechanic's assistant, while the eldest son, who is 11,
does odd jobs _ packing groceries or pumping gas or stocking
shelves _ for tips. Then he gives his mother the money.
</P>
<P>
   The son ``keeps saying, `Let's go back to Mexico, where we could
live better,''' Mrs. Martinez said with a laugh. Like many
immigrants in Tulare County, the family comes from a dirt-poor town
in Michoacan, in central Mexico. She said she tells her son that
they are still better off here than there, or just the same when
there is a freeze.

SPORTS COLUMN: WHY PLATO IS IN THIS HALL OF FAME

<P>
   KINGSTON, R.I. _ Plato couldn't make it, but Byron ``Whizzer''
White, Ken Dryden, Donna Lopiano, Yasutaka Matsudaira and Kwaku
Ohene-Frempong did. And Bill Bradley stopped by the night before.
</P>
<P>
   They were here for Sunday's inaugural induction ceremony of the
International Scholar-Athlete Hall of Fame, a charming white
building whose architecture might best be described as Grecian
Colonial on the University of Rhode Island campus.
</P>
<P>
   You won't find leather football helmets or cracked goaltender's
masks here, but you will find tributes to 20 people who took
studying as seriously as they took sport. As more of today's
college athletes should.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never considered myself a scholar or an athlete,'' said
Dryden, the Toronto Maple Leafs' president. ``I was just somebody
who loved to play and loved to learn. I came to realize that the
best kind of learning came with play, and the best kind of play
came with learning.''
</P>
<P>
   The inaugural inductees were selected by a panel of more than
2,000 academicians, journalists, Olympic officials and former
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend to honor the great athlete,'' said Dan Doyle, the
founder of the Institute for International Sport, which is
conducting the U.S. Scholar-Athlete Games here this week.
``Meanwhile, we praise the scholar-athlete, but never really honor
him or her. This hall of fame will honor the world's greatest
scholar-athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the inductees will be familiar, but why Plato? Because
the Greek thinker, who is believed to have been a wrestler in the
Isthmian Games that were a warm-up to the ancient Olympics, argued
for the scholar-athlete ideal of mind and body, that physical
training should complement philosophical education for the best men
and women.
</P>
<P>
   The other inductees:
</P>
<P>
   Tenley Albright Blakeley, a graduate of Radcliffe and Harvard
Medical School, is a Boston surgeon. In 1956 she was the first
American woman to win gold in Olympic figure skating.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Ashe, a graduate of UCLA, won the first U.S. Open tennis
title in 1968 and Wimbledon in 1975. He later emerged as a
worldwide sociological voice for African-American athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Bannister, a British neurologist, was the first to break 4
minutes for the mile, running it in 3 minutes 59.4 seconds in 1954.
He's a past president of the International Council for Sport and
Recreation.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley, a Rhodes scholar and basketball all-American at
Princeton, is a former senator from New Jersey and currently a
presidential candidate. He was on the Knicks' two championship
teams.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush, the 41st president of the United States, was a Phi
Beta Kappa economics graduate of Yale and the captain of its 1948
baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre de Coubertin, a French educator, proposed the first
modern Olympics in 1896 to promote world peace and education
through sports.
</P>
<P>
   James ``Doc'' Counsilman, a Ph.D., was a two-time U.S. Olympic
swimming coach. At age 58, he swam the English Channel.
</P>
<P>
   Anita DeFrantz, a Connecticut College graduate and an Olympic
rower, is the first female vice president of the International
Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Dryden, a graduate of Cornell and McGill Law School, was the
Montreal Canadiens' goaltender on six Stanley Cup championship
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Ford, the 38th president of the United States, was the
center on two University of Michigan national championship football
teams. As a Yale Law School graduate, he served 25 years in the
House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Jones, a lawyer who was a graduate of Georgia Tech and
Harvard, completed golf's Grand Slam in 1930, sweeping the U.S.
Open, British Open, U.S. Amateur and British Amateur.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Lopiano, a Southern Connecticut State graduate,
participated in 26 national championships in softball, basketball,
volleyball and field hockey. She is the director of the Women's
Sports Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Yasutaka Matsudaira, a graduate of Keio University in Japan, is
credited with revolutionizing volleyball with his multiple
quick-attack system. He coached Japan to Olympic gold in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   James Naismith, a Canadian educated at McGill University and
Presbyterian College in Montreal, invented basketball in 1891 as a
physical education teacher at what is now Springfield College in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Kwaku Ohene-Frempong, a Ghana native who excelled in soccer and
track at Yale, is a hematologist, the chief medical officer of the
Sickle Cell Disease Association of America.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Robeson, a Phi Beta Kappa and all-America running back at
Rutgers, emerged as a compelling African-American actor and singer.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Benoit Samuelson, now an author and a trustee of her alma
mater, Bowdoin, won the first women's Olympic marathon in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Snell, who won three Olympic gold medals in the 800 and
1,500 meters for New Zealand, is the director of the Human
Performance Laboratory at the University of Texas Southwestern
Medical Center in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Byron ``Whizzer'' White, a U.S. Supreme Court Justice for 31
years, was Phi Beta Kappa, a Rhodes scholar and an all-America
running back at the University of Colorado before joining the
Pittsburgh Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   So if you're driving I-95 with your kids, take the Kingston exit
and stop by a hall where fame is more than a game. Plato would like
that.

SPORTS COLUMN: IT'S CHECKETTS' TURN AS SEASONS CHANGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ Now the New York Knicks' season is officially
over.
</P>
<P>
   Tears from Friday's loss baked dry by Sunday's hot midday sun,
disappointment softened by the passing of nearly 48 hours. The
Knicks arrived at their practice facility in cars and sport utility
vehicles to clear out lockers, coordinate summer plans. One by one
they emerged, looking backward and forward.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Childs recalled Friday's 1-point loss at Madison Square
Garden that brought San Antonio the National Basketball Association
championship. ``Watching them celebrate on our court was not
enjoyable,'' Childs said. ``That was motivation enough to work
harder during the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Camby spoke exuberantly of summer league competition and
getting stronger. Allan Houston spoke of staying in shape, not
becoming puffed up by Knicks fans telling the team how great it was
just to come close. Latrell Sprewell, resurrected as savior if not
quite a saint, came out and spoke briefly.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Patrick Aloysius Ewing emerged and was immediately
mobbed. If Sprewell and Camby were the unexpected stars of the
Knicks' championship run, Ewing is the central figure of whatever
will come next. He was injured through the stretch run and watched
the final round from the bench as the Knicks compensated for his
lost presence with quickness, speed and heart. A perfect fit for an
ambush season. Could Ewing fit back in?
</P>
<P>
   What do the Knicks need to do to get over the top?
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to play, that's it,'' Ewing said.
</P>
<P>
   Will the lineup work with Ewing joining Sprewell and Houston? He
said that was the coach's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the dagger question, the question that has dominated
Knicks debates since Ewing's Achilles' tendon problems limited his
effectiveness and then ended his season prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether his role would change, Ewing winced and said he
was tired of reading how the Knicks would be better off without
him. ``My role is not going to change,'' he said. ``I have a lot of
great players on my team, we just have to believe in each other and
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone asked if Ewing was ready to do what David Robinson did _
give up some shots, as Robinson did for for Tim Duncan. ``I gave up
shots,'' Ewing said. ``And on that note you all have a nice day.''
</P>
<P>
   When the season started in February, the pressure was on
Sprewell and Camby to perform; Sprewell for what he had done, Camby
for whom he replaced. They did their part. In the process, they
helped transform the Knicks into a faster, younger team from a
plodding halfcourt team built around Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   Now the pressure is squarely on Dave Checketts, the Madison
Square Garden president. The new Knicks are poised to be
juggernauts for the next two or three seasons, but they need some
answers. Can the Knicks retain the same up-tempo flow and still use
Ewing's low-post presence? Checketts is like the chess player who
has gained great position and superior material but at the moment
of truth needs a brilliant move.
</P>
<P>
   The move may be making Ed Tapscott, currently the Knicks' vice
president of player personnel, the team president and general
manager. The problem with Knicks general managers was that they
either had basketball sense or intelligence but never both
simultaneously. Tapscott, a lawyer and former head coach at George
Washington, who helped the deposed Ernie Grunfeld orchestrate some
of the Knicks' better acquisitions, has both.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks are a smooth-running team with two charismatic
players in Sprewell and Camby, a ``clean-cut'' emerging star in
Houston, and Ewing, the mainstay. What to do with Ewing? ``They
need me to play,'' he said. ``That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jeff Van Gundy agreed, saying, ``I always emphasize to
Patrick that the importance of him has not changed at all.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Knicks need is a governor, someone to control speed,
pressure, pace emotion and loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   As this Knicks became a quicker, faster-playing team, I wondered
whether Van Gundy really enjoyed this new style of play or simply
enjoyed surviving and winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Style doesn't matter,'' Van Gundy said.``It might matter to
people who watch it, but methods don't matter, results do. You play
however you feel you can best win. If I feel it's best to win
trying to keep it at 50-48, that's how I'll keep it. And if I think
it's best to play 120-118, that's how we'll play because methods
don't matter. Results do.''
</P>
<P>
   Style does matter, and Van Gundy better not try that 50-48
nonsense next season; Checketts better not let him. Knicks fans
didn't simply enjoy the ride to the championship series, they
enjoyed the way they got there. The speed, excitement, the
take-no-prisoner attitude and schoolyard dunks made the Knicks' old
50-48 signature seem prehistoric.
</P>
<P>
   How ya gonna keep `em down on the farm, after they've seen
Paree?

WITH BIRDIES IN A ROW, IT'S INKSTER'S DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RON SIRAK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Del. _ Time and again, Juli Inkster tapped into an
inner reservoir of strength and found the big shot she needed. Time
and again, she made an important putt and accentuated it with a
tight-lipped smile, and followed a disappointing miss with a
grunted lecture to herself.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, it seemed as if she might lose the struggle
being waged deep within and let her flirtation with history slip
away.
</P>
<P>
   Then, just when it appeared as if she might be going to the well
for miracles too often, Inkster closed brilliantly Sunday to win
the McDonald's Ladies Professional Golf Association Championship
and become only the second woman to complete the modern career
Grand Slam.
</P>
<P>
   Dancing and fist-pumping her way to a close of eagle, birdie,
birdie with a scintillating series of putts for a final-round 65,
Inkster finished at 16-under-par 268, four strokes ahead of
Liselotte Neumann and five better than Mardi Lunn and Nancy
Scranton.
</P>
<P>
   Added to the U.S. Open that Inkster won three weeks ago, she
ended an odyssey that began in 1984 when she won the Nabisco Dinah
Shore and the du Maurier Classic, the other designated LPGA majors,
to join Pat Bradley as the only women to win all four.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won two pretty quick and I didn't think it was going to be
that tough,'' Inkster said about waiting 15 years to finish the
Grand Slam. ``I can't comprehend it. I want to savor this. I worked
really hard the last three years to get back to where I should
be.''
</P>
<P>
   That climb back came after she negotiated her daughters Hayley,
9, and Cori, 5, through infancy. Inkster's first three majors _ she
also won the Dinah Shore in 1989 _ came before her children were
born.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 39, she has won two Grand Slam events since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just doing what any mother would do,'' Inkster said.
</P>
<P>
   Greatness in an athlete is frequently found in how they perform
when they are not at the top of their game. And Inkster was not
hitting on all cylinders when Sunday's round started at DuPont
Country Club. The frustration, and perhaps the pressure, was
evident.
</P>
<P>
   Inkster started the round sharing the lead with Scranton and
Cristie Kerr, and she seemed tense as she missed 4-footer after
4-footer on the practice green. It was a trend that carried over
into the round.
</P>
<P>
   On the third tee, Inkster glared back at the second green where
she had just missed a 5-foot birdie putt, and hissed an emphatic
``Man!'' snapping her head forward to stress the point. After
missing an 8-foot birdie try on No. 6, she stood with arms folded
and stared at her shoes. Then her momentum changed when an 8-foot,
par-saving putt found the bottom of the cup on No. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Looking relaxed for the first time, Inkster strolled to the back
of the eighth tee, and talked with her husband, Brian. Moments
later she was rolling in her first birdie putt of the day _ a
20-footer _ and followed that with a 15-footer on No. 9 to take a
lead she never surrendered, although she was forced to share it
briefly with a game group of challengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really got me going,'' she said about saving par on No.
7. ``Brian said, `Good work,' and told me to just keep doing what
I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Inkster put on an awesome putting display over the last 12
holes, needing only one putt nine times, including consecutive
10-foot, par-saving putts on Nos. 13 and 14. At that point, Inkster
appeared to be relying too heavily on miracles, but then she
reached inside and found something even more special.
</P>
<P>
   The par-saving putts on 7, 13 and 14 won the tournament, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Several players performed very well on this sultry Sunday, but
no one could run with Inkster when she kicked toward the finish
line. At one point _ with Neumann through 16 holes, Inkster through
15 and Scranton through 14 _ there was a three-way tie at 12 under
par.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt really good when I made that birdie at 16,'' Neumann
said. ``I was right in the hunt. Then Juli played the last three
holes four under par. It's hard to put pressure on someone playing
that well.''
</P>
<P>
   On No. 16, Inkster hit a 5-wood she described as a career shot
from 232 yards to within 18 feet, and made the eagle putt.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was an 8-iron to six feet on No. 17, and a 7-iron to 20
feet on the final hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``That one was like I was putting into a bucket,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As she did at Old Waverly where she won the U.S. Open, Inkster
was able to acknowledge victory after her approach shot to the
final green. This time she sprinted forward, wrapped playing
partner Meg Mallon in a warm hug and raised both arms high above
her head in what amounted to a symbolic V for victory.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was her fourth of the year on tour and the $210,000
first prize put Inkster at the top of the money list with $952,994.
She is now only one point away from qualifying for the LPGA Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's doable,'' she said. ``It would be nice if it happened
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems almost certain that the Hall of Fame is an honor
Inkster will not need another 15 years to claim.

BUNKER MENTALITY WINS FOR WALDORF ON 19TH HOLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISON, N.Y. _ Running out of holes, and running out of
opportunities, Duffy Waldorf picked the perfect time for a birdie
binge on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by two strokes with two holes left in regulation,
Waldorf birdied Nos. 17 and 18 to force a playoff, then birdied the
first playoff hole (No. 18) to win the Buick Classic in dramatic
fashion over Dennis Paulson. Waldorf and Paulson both finished
regulation at 8 under par (276), one stroke ahead of Chris Perry,
who finished third, and two strokes ahead of Scott Hoch.
</P>
<P>
   It was a special victory for Waldorf, who had won just once
before on the PGA Tour, but who rose to the occasion when others
could not.
</P>
<P>
   Two superb bunker shots were the key to Waldorf's victory. At
No. 18 during regulation, Waldorf delicately floated a full-swing
bunker shot 30 yards from the cup to within 5 feet, setting up the
birdie putt that forced a playoff. Then in the playoff, Waldorf's
bunker shot from 40 yards landed just 12 feet past the cup, setting
up the tournament-clinching birdie putt.
</P>
<P>
   Not often does a player facing two long bunker shots get up and
down twice for birdies to win a tournament. But Waldorf did, and at
age 37 he left Westchester Country Club with a $450,000 first-place
check, his first tour victory since 1995, and the knowledge that he
was still good enough to defeat the world's best players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never, never had a finish like this,'' said Waldorf,
whose other tour victory came at the 1995 LaCantera Texas Open.
``If you looked at the bunker shots I hit all week, those were my
two best without a doubt. I kind of let my instinct take over,
because a long bunker shot is one of the hardest. That was a great
way to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Waldorf had just two rounds in the 60s (70-67-68-71), but he was
resilient as he overcame six bogeys in his final round to win. He
enjoys writing messages on his golf balls, and the ball he used on
the final four holes was adorned with this message, ``It's up to
you, N.Y., N.Y.'' It was fitting, because when it was up to
Waldorf, he delivered.
</P>
<P>
   For Paulson, who shot a final-round 67, it was a difficult
defeat, but a career-best showing for a 36-year-old player who has
never won on tour. Starting the day at 4 under par, four strokes
behind Waldorf and Perry, Paulson teed off 54 minutes before
Waldorf and played a terrific final round to take the clubhouse
lead. Then Paulson waited nervously to see if any of the remaining
contenders could beat him.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, other players eliminated themselves with costly
mistakes, falling like dominoes. But Waldorf finally forced the
playoff, making a 6-foot birdie putt on No. 17 to start his birdie
run. Afterward, Paulson was a gracious loser. Perhaps the one shot
Paulson wanted back was an 18-foot birdie attempt that he missed on
No. 18 during regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing in one sense, but I hit a lot of good putts
that didn't go in the hole,'' said Paulson, a good friend of
Waldorf, who grew up playing many junior golf tournaments against
him in California. ``Duffy hit great bunker shots. I can't tell you
how great that bunker shot was he hit to get into the playoff. He
had to commit to swinging hard. It was a pretty impressive shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Paulson made a costly mistake with his second shot on the
playoff hole, the par-5, 526-yard No. 18. After hitting his drive
in the right fringe, Paulson hit a 3-wood from 245 yards that faded
right. It landed in the rough behind the right green-side bunker,
underneath a tree that made it impossible for Paulson to play a
high wedge shot onto the green.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 yards from the pin, Paulson was forced to attempt a
difficult low punch shot that had to carry the bunker, yet land
softly on the green. The shot hit a branch and stopped short of the
green, still about 30 feet from the pin.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Waldorf had reached the left green-side bunker in two
shots. His final bunker shot was pure, rolling across the green,
and stopping on the fringe, about 12 feet past the cup.
</P>
<P>
   Then Paulson hit a poor chip shot that rolled 18 feet past the
cup, and he missed his putt coming back for a costly bogey. At that
point, Waldorf knew he could 2-putt from 12 feet and still win. But
he wasted no time, making the putt for birdie and then celebrating.
A wine connoisseur, Waldorf knew how he would celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was at home, I'd open up every wine I had, all the most
expensive ones,'' he said. ``I have a couple of bottles picked
out.''

AMERICANS GO THE BENCH; RESULT IS STILL FIRST-RATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. _ On a night when four starters rested, the
United States showed the depth of its bench by overpowering North
Korea, 3-0, in the final match of group play in the Women's World
Cup. Tisha Venturini scored two goals and celebrated with a back
flip, bringing a little spring into the Americans' step after a
torpid, scoreless first half.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon MacMillan also scored a goal and collected two assists
as the Americans (3-0) advanced to the quarterfinals to play
Germany on Thursday night at Jack Kent Cooke Stadium in suburban
Washington. By reaching the quarterfinals, the United States also
qualified to defend its title at the 2000 Summer Olympics in
Sydney, Australia, and it remains on course as the favorite to win
this tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The first goal came in the 58th minute, awakening a somnolent
crowd of 50,484 at Foxboro Stadium. MacMillan, a hero on the 1996
Olympic team who was starting her first match of this World Cup,
took a pass from Julie Foudy on the left flank and laced a short
hopper inside the left post. The North Korean goalie Kye Yong Sun
should have stopped the shot, but she could only manage a futile
dive.
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes later, MacMillan fielded a cross from Tiffeny
Milbrett and chipped a pass to Venturini, another first-time
starter, who headed the ball into the net for the second American
goal. In the 76th minute, MacMillan found Venturini on a free kick
for another header, which Venturini saluted with a back flip. She
had been an Olympic starter, but her role had been diminished in
recent years. On Sunday night, she demonstrated the resourcefulness
of the American team, which is deeper than any other in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Carlo Facchin, coach of the Italian team that tied Germany, 1-1,
in group play last Sunday, said that the reliable, organized German
team could give the Americans trouble. But the Germans have proved
to be a step slow, and in allowing a goal in extra time Sunday in a
3-3 tie with Brazil, they have shown vulnerability in protecting a
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the U.S. will have difficulty with Germany,'' Facchin
said. ``They know how to keep the level of the game controlled. I
think if the U.S. can raise the level of the match with speed, it
is going to win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   With advancement certain, barring a complete collapse, the
Americans had the delicate task Sunday night of trying to rest some
of their players while not losing the momentum the team had gained
in shutting out Denmark, 3-0, and routing Nigeria, 7-1. Having
scored 10 goals and surrendered only 1, the United States had
covered itself regarding the first tie-breaker in group play, goal
differential.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a quarterfinal match Thursday and a potential semifinal
match next Sunday in Palo Alto, Calif., along with the rough
tackling style of North Korea, coach Tony DiCicco gave four
starters the night off.
</P>
<P>
   Midfielder Michelle Akers, the star of the 1991 Women's World
Cup has chronic fatigue syndrome and has to ration her playing
time. Kate Sobrero, a gritty defender, sat out the match, resting a
wrenched ankle for the quarterfinal. Foudy also took a rest in
midfield, as did the team's leading scorer this season, Milbrett.
</P>
<P>
   Inserted into the lineup along with MacMillan and Venturini were
the speedy Sara Whalen and Tiffany Roberts in defense. Brandi
Chastain was moved forward from defense to the midfield in the
restructured lineup.
</P>
<P>
   With a previous victory and a defeat in group play, the North
Koreans needed to defeat the Americans to advance over Nigeria into
the quarterfinals against Brazil on Thursday. Given their
precarious position, the North Koreans took no chances. They were
content to play with five defenders, packing the penalty box,
hoping to smother the relentless American attack and perhaps get a
counterattack goal or a penalty shot at the other end.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four minutes into the match, North Korea had already
collected two yellow-card warnings for rough tackles. The
Americans, meanwhile, seemed torpid, the urgency gone from their
game along with four starters. Perhaps their energy was sapped by
the muggy air or the knowledge that they would advance as long as
they were not humiliated. Or maybe they missed Akers' ability to
control the midfield and spray passes ahead.
</P>
<P>
   By patiently working the ball from side to side, the Americans
gradually began to find seams in the North Korean defense. Cindy
Parlow floated a shot just over the crossbar. MacMillan fired a
blast from point-blank range that was stopped by a sliding save.
Carla Overbeck launched a rocket from the top of the penalty box.
But nothing found the net as the Americans kept missing high, like
a Mark Wohlers fastball.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea threatened only once in the first half, as Jin Pyol
Hui lofted a shot from the left wing that U.S. goalie Briana Scurry
did not appear to immediately lock onto with her personal radar.
But Scurry backpedaled gracefully, tracking the shot down and
swatting it away.

BECKER AND TEEN-AGERS MAKE WEEK 1 THEIR OWN
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ A soap opera on some days, a nostalgia
festival on others, and suspiciously rain-free through the first
week, Wimbledon has been nothing if not a portent that the more
things change, the more they stay the same.
</P>
<P>
   Although this may be his final joy ride, Boris Becker still
gallops around Center Court with the impunity of an overgrown
Napoleon. And although this may be their first brush with Grand
Slam success, ruthless little girls still stop at nothing to grab
the brass ring of the fast-track carousel they have been hoisted
onto by ambitious parents.
</P>
<P>
   Over on the men's side heading into the round of 16, the
31-year-old Becker is going for glory one last time, Pete Sampras
is aiming for a Grand Slam record with a sixth Wimbledon crown and
Andre Agassi is proving his 1999 French Open title, which made him
the first man since Rod Laver to scale all four Grand Slam events,
was no New Age fluke.
</P>
<P>
   But in the women's quadrant, flux and unfamiliar faces, along
with a noxious gossip quotient, are providing the plot. These days,
gaining a high profile in women's tennis is a little like marrying
Henry VIII. You're apt to lose your head.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had Martina Hingis, the top-ranked teen-ager humbled
in Wimbledon's opening round, gone slinking off to lick her wounds,
and repair an ill-timed estrangement from her mother, then three
younger teens, each of them as driven as the suddenly defunct
Hingis, sprang up to take her place.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of Hingis, the century's youngest No. 1 when she was 16
and Wimbledon's youngest champion in 1997, has devolved into a sob
story in 1999. Hingis, now 18, seems to have come into her
adolescent rebellion belatedly, and so far she and her results are
suffering for it.
</P>
<P>
   Her verbal outbursts have included a derogatory reference to
Amelie Mauresmo, runner-up to her in the Australian Open, as ``half
a man'' after she announced her lesbianism there; a description of
Jana Novotna, her discarded doubles partner and Wimbledon's
defending singles and doubles champion, as ``old and slow,'' and a
snide remark about Steffi Graf being over the hill in a game
populated by a group Hingis likes to call the Spice Girls of
Tennis.
</P>
<P>
   When Graf defeated her for the French Open title earlier this
month, Hingis put on a tantrum notable for a trespass onto Graf's
side of the court to argue a line call and a pair of defiant
underhand serves on match points, prompting the fans to boo her off
the court. After her mother/coach, Melanie Molitor, insisted that
she return for the trophy presentations, Hingis did, but it was
apparently the last time she followed advice from Molitor.
</P>
<P>
   Before Wimbledon began, the two agreed to distance themselves
from each other, and when Hingis was trampled by 6-2, 6-0 in the
first round by 16-year-old Jelena Dokic, a Slovak-born prodigy whom
Molitor and Hingis tutored on their backyard courts this spring,
Molitor was back in Switzerland instead of in the Friends Box.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Friends Box lacked prominent occupants. Under close
scrutiny by the British press, as well as officials of the WTA
Tour, was Dokic's father, Damir, who introduced himself to the
limelight three weeks ago by getting thrown out of the Edgbaston
event for causing a ruckus.
</P>
<P>
   Damir Dokic then lay in the middle of the road and had to be
removed by the Birmingham police, who cautioned him about his
drunkenness but let him sleep off his troubles in their jail and
returned him to the custody of his daughter without pressing
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his mouthing off about England, which he disparaged as
far inferior to Sydney, Australia, the home base he selected for
his prodigy when she was 9, his behavior has been unremarkable ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   But Damir Dokic, who recently dismissed Lester Bowrey, the
Australian Fed Cup captain, as his daughter's coach and tennis
confidant, has been given the tabloid label ``the tennis father
from hell.''
</P>
<P>
   He seems to be replacing the parent of another of Wimbledon
1999's emergent teens. It was exactly a year ago that Mirjana
Lucic, the Croatian talent who won her first professional event at
15, decided to flee from Zagreb to Florida with her mother and
three siblings after having a violent argument with her father and
coach, Marinko, during Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   Lucic has since accused her father of physically and emotionally
abusive conduct and has cut all ties to him. Now 17 and based at
the Bollettieri Sports Academy in Bradenton, Fla., Lucic is making
a comeback after settling her domestic woes and hiring a coach, Joe
Giuliano, skilled in the art of constructive, not destructive,
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was used to pressure a lot, because I had it from all over,
always,'' said Lucic, who called the juxtaposition of teen stars
with parent-coaches an ``almost impossible'' relationship for a
family to survive.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After Lucic, whose game is reminiscent of Graf's in the same
vein that Dokic's resembles that of Hingis, outgunned Monica Seles
to reach her first Grand Slam Round of 16, Giuliano said he had
needed to rebuild her emotional core before bothering to fine-tune
her game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to build back her self-esteem,'' Giuliano said. ``She
had to be able to think of herself as a good person first before
she got the chance to be a great player.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were basically saying that Lucic was through, that she
couldn't play anymore, but we wanted to come here and make a
statement that yes, she's back, and with a vengeance.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliano previously worked with Dokic's next opponent, Mary
Pierce, whose coach and father, Jim, was expelled from the circuit
for five years because of improper conduct similar to that ascribed
to Marinko Lucic.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the two European-born teens, both of whom turned
professional at 15, Wimbledon served as a coming-out party for
18-year-old Alexandra Stevenson, a California-based powerhouse with
an absentee father but a mother, Samantha, who groomed her
6-foot-1-inch daughter for this career path by retracing the
intricate coaching steps taken by another Southern California
standout, Pete Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson's Wimbledon idyll has not been free of controversies,
generated by remarks made by her mother during impromptu news
conferences. According to Samantha Stevenson, a freelance
sportswriter whose work appears in The New York Times as well as
other publications, Alexandra, who is black, has been subjected to
racist remarks and a general lack of respect by opponents on the
WTA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   The Stevensons are also in a dispute with the tour, which
maintains that Alexandra _ who decided to turn pro for this
tournament _ entered the tournament as an amateur and is not
entitled to prize money. Samantha Stevenson says that she informed
the tournament committee at the Wimbledon qualifying tournament
about Alexandra's intent to turn pro.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson decided to reject a scholarship offer from UCLA in
order to follow in the footprints of her role models Venus and
Serena Williams. Stevenson, who upset 11th-seeded Julie
Halard-Decugis to earn a round of 16 berth, was the giddiest of the
teen threesome making moves at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought a pair of shoes, these really cool high platform
shoes, like Spice Girl shoes, and a really cool green dress,'' said
Stevenson, who wants to win Wimbledon by age 19. ``I will be ready
with my serve-and-volley game and forehand; I'm taking it one match
at a time and looking one step forward. I'm in the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, they all are.

 &HT;    Cancer takes Lt. Gov.'s wife
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Mary Brogan, the wife and childhood
sweetheart of Lt. Gov. Frank Brogan, died with him by her side
Sunday at Tallahassee Memorial Hospital two years after being
diagnosed with cancer. She was 44.
</P>
<P>
   ``Columba and I are saddened beyond words at the loss of Mary
Brogan,'' said Gov. Jeb Bush, who ordered the state's flags to be
lowered in her honor. ``We have lost a true friend, Frank has lost
a true partner and the people of Florida have lost a true public
servant with a big heart.''
</P>
<P>
   A former Martin County school teacher and assistant principal,
Mrs. Brogan was first diagnosed with cancer in 1997 when she
discovered a lump in her breast. Doctors found the cancer had
spread to her bones and she underwent a mastectomy and bone marrow
transplant at Shands Hospital at the University of Florida in
Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   She was in remission for more than a year when, in December
1998, doctors once again found cancer. This time it had spread to
her brain. The treatment for her cancer was so painful that she
confided that she dreaded going through treatments again.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a whisper, she said, ``It's not me I'm worried about. I
worry about Frank.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank and Mary Brogan were Catholic school students when they
met as teenagers in Cincinnati, Ohio. After college they came to
Florida where they both eventually became teachers in Martin
County. Both became school administrators and Frank Brogan was
elected schools superintendent in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Bright, funny, articulate, hard working, telegenic and
ambitious, Mrs. Brogan proved to be an able political partner when
the couple decided that Frank Brogan should run for state education
commissioner in 1994. Mrs. Brogan's popularity often overpowered
her husband's and the couple seemed to have unlimited
possibilities. Many Republicans believe Frank Brogan could be
governor or a U.S. senator.
</P>
<P>
   Last year he was picked to be Bush's running mate. In October,
Mrs. Brogan joined the campaign's final bus tour of the state.
Still in remission, she stood outside the bus one afternoon and
said she believed, with her fingers crossed for luck, that the
worst was behind her.
</P>
<P>
   Days before Christmas, doctors gave her the bad news that the
cancer was back. In January, when her husband was sworn in as
lieutenant governor, scores of women wore hats in a show of support
for Mrs. Brogan who had taken to wearing hats due to hair loss
caused by therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``No story about Mary would be complete without children,'' said
Betty Coxe, who used to teach school with Mrs. Brogan in Stuart and
remembered her constantly being surrounded by students. ``She had
that Pied Piperette-ability to have all the kids worship and adore
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Not having children of her own, Mrs. Brogan once said that ``if
you're dedicated, education becomes so much a part of your life
that the children, the teachers, the parents and the community
become your family.''
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, the Brogans were never shy about showing their genuine
affection for each other. Once when the couple visited the Orange
Avenue Charter School in Fort Pierce a third grader asked Brogan _
``Is your wife a queen?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think so,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral services in Tallahassee and Martin County were still
being planned Sunday. The Brogan family is asking that donations be
made in her memory to the Mary J. Brogan Scholarship Fund, care of
Martin County Community Foundation II. In addition to her husband,
Mary Brogan is survived by two sisters, Jane Leisring and Carol
Stacey, both of Cincinnati.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE WOMEN CATCH UP 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. _ Women's soccer is catching up with men's
soccer. This is not necessarily all to the good.
</P>
<P>
   The American and North Korean women, with separate agendas,
played basically separate games in a slow-developing 3-0 American
victory Sunday night. The steamy evening went along with the
survival brand of soccer often seen toward the end of first-round
games in the men's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   After finally breaking through the Korean wall, the Yanks play
Germany in the quarterfinal round in suburban Maryland on Thursday
night and the North Koreans go home.
</P>
<P>
   The Yanks, who needed only to avoid being beaten by double
figures, used the game to work in fresh players, let some excellent
subs win their varsity letter and save some regulars for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The North Koreans, who had needed a victory, were eliminated
after doing what they had to do _ shorten the field, pack the
defenders and hope for some grotesque mistake by the Yanks.
</P>
<P>
   It was a shame to have such a dull and scoreless first half
after the excitement generated by the women in the first week. The
skill and charisma of the Americans and other teams had captivated
enough people to form a new layer of fans.
</P>
<P>
   Women's soccer has come of age in the past decade, marked by
aggressive offense and very little of the diving and flopping
exhibited by the men. Because women are smaller and less powerful
than the men, the field seems bigger, with more room for creativity
and initiative.
</P>
<P>
   From Portland to Chicago, San Jose to New Jersey, some of the
passes and runs and saves and tackles have been exquisite, bringing
aficionado cheers in the stands _ and more than a few exclamations
of ``Nice ball!'' in the press box.
</P>
<P>
   There were not many shouts of ``Nice ball!'' Sunday night. The
North Koreans played with a 1-1-10 defense (that's a bad soccer
joke; each team is allowed only 10 field players) and the
Americans' lineup was so radically altered that the players seemed
to be working things out as they went along.
</P>
<P>
   The best game of the day was on the tube, direct from Jack Kent
Cooke Stadium. It is an official soccer law that every World Cup,
male or female, must have a Group of Death. The noted German
player, Juergen Klinsmann _ now retired and gone to heaven in
California _ has been apologizing profusely for picking the
``wrong'' name out of the hat during the official draw in February,
thereby putting his homeland in the Todtgruppe.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams had incentives to win Sunday _ avoiding the United
States in the next round. Brazil, whose women wear the same
hallowed blue and yellow garb as its men, showed why it is always
the spiritual favorite. Trailing after 90 minutes of regulation
time, Maicon of Brazil lofted home a soft, graceful shot that gave
Brazil a 3-3 tie, and the players cavorted just as you would expect
Brazilian players to do.
</P>
<P>
   Finally there was a sense of tension and emotion in this World
Cup because the good teams have generally been bombing the mediocre
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday the action moved to this steamy outback of New England.
With absolutely nothing to gain, Italy beat Mexico, 2-0, in the
first game. One family right in front of the press box displayed
absolute equal opportunity _ the girl had a HAMM jersey, the boy
had a MALDINI jersey, for the stylish captain of the Italian men's
team.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has had only moments of terror in the first
round. Denmark hung on for a while before a 3-0 loss. Then Nigeria
scored the first goal before succumbing, 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   In a nice gesture, totally supportable by the depth of the
American team, Tony DiCicco started three of his gold-medal players
from the 1996 Summer Games in Georgia who had not started to date:
Tiffany Roberts, Tisha Venturini and Shannon MacMillan. He also
started Sara Whalen, a young defender.
</P>
<P>
   With the Koreans packing the defenses, hoping for a miracle, the
Americans took a long time to get untracked. The new formation
never got untracked. In fact, their goalkeeper, Briana Scurry, did
have some desperate moments, slapping away one soft, high lob,
smothering another low shot off a breakaway.
</P>
<P>
   The Yanks finally broke through in the second half, with one
goal by MacMillan and two by Venturini, from the 1996 gold-medal
game. Venturini celebrated her second with a backflip, the kind
that Ozzie Smith used to perform on the last day of the baseball
season.
</P>
<P>
   The backflip was quite likely to be seen on the sports highlight
shows that normally avoid any sighting of soccer, as if to keep
loyal Americans from being contaminated by such subversive doings.
However, a backflip by the lithe Venturini is the stuff of
highlight tapes. Maybe she even planned it, the way male basketball
players plan their dunks, with an eye toward the replay. The women
are catching up with the men, in every way.

EDITORIAL: A MEMORABLE RUN 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, June 28:
</P>
<P>
   The laws of basketball finally caught up with the New York
Knicks Friday night, when their thrilling and improbable run at the
National Basketball Association championship ended in a 78-77 loss
to the San Antonio Spurs. They were too short and too banged up to
compete against a taller, healthier ball club that genuinely
deserved the title. Yet when the Knicks were finally done, when
Latrell Sprewell missed a last-second, off-balance jump shot, the
crowd at Madison Square Garden gave them a winners' ovation. They
deserved it. Despite crippling injuries, the Knicks somehow
contrived to defeat three favored teams in the playoffs and give an
honorable account of themselves in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   The national television ratings were down, probably because
Michael Jordan was not around and because the viewers decided this
was a mismatch. Too bad for the viewers. They missed the formal
certification of the Spurs' Tim Duncan as a true superstar and _ in
Sprewell's 35-point performance on Friday _ one of the great
individual displays in playoff history. Above all they missed the
magical, real-time evolution of the Knicks from primitive plodders
to creative artists.
</P>
<P>
   In Sprewell, Allan Houston and Marcus Camby, three explosive
players, the Knicks have the nucleus of a championship team. But
can they mesh with Patrick Ewing, the Knicks' all-star center? It
was Ewing's injury, after all, that forced Jeff Van Gundy, the
coach, to turn Sprewell, Camby and Houston loose. The Knicks have
left warm memories, and some pleasurable off-season puzzles.

 PEACE PROCESS STALLED, BUT MANY IN ULSTER EXPECT IT TO GO ON
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   BELFAST _ Last year, when compromise finally came to Northern
Ireland, native son Seamus Heaney was moved to write that it was a
time when hope and history rhymed.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, history is not rhyming so much as repeating
itself in a place where intransigence has been widely regarded as a
strength, and compromise a sign of weakness.
</P>
<P>
   More than a year after the people of Northern Ireland
overwhelmingly approved a referendum that created structures
designed to move the conflict from the battlefield to the political
arena _ and basked in the international acclaim that followed _ the
peace process is stalled.
</P>
<P>
   The Northern Ireland Assembly, held up as the cornerstone of a
new, more equitable society, is in danger of being shelved even
before it regains the powers the British government summarily took
over in 1972 when the violence, which has killed more than 3,500
since 1969, was at its worst.
</P>
<P>
   As it has been since the Irish Republican Army called an initial
cease-fire in 1994, the sticking point is the fate of the IRA's
weapons. Protestant unionists refuse to sit in a power-sharing
government with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political representatives,
until the IRA begins disarming.
</P>
<P>
   But the Good Friday Agreement, which was reached in April 1998,
and endorsed by 71 percent of the voters in Northern Ireland and 95
percent in the Irish Republic, says only that the decommissioning
of paramilitary weapons should be completed by May 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA has categorically ruled out turning in its weapons,
saying that would amount to a surrender it did not agree to. The
IRA remembers what happened in 1969, when it was caught unarmed as
loyalist mobs overran Catholic neighborhoods, a humiliation it has
vowed will never be repeated.
</P>
<P>
   But unionists say that unless the IRA disarms, it will be
impossible to build a genuine democracy, because there will always
be the threat that the IRA will go back to war if its political
representatives don't get their way.
</P>
<P>
   The British and Irish governments have set Wednesday as the
deadline for agreement, and for creating the power-sharing
government. On Friday, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his
Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, gave the parties a proposal to
break the stalemate. It calls for Sinn Fein to be allowed into
government, but insists the party must accept firm timetables that
call for the IRA to disarm by May 2000, and face expulsion from
government if the timetables are not met.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews here with leading politicians suggest that both the
unionists and Sinn Fein are prepared to let the deadline pass.
Although Blair says he has no Plan B, there is little hope that
Plan A will be accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Unionist leader David Trimble said the proposed compromise falls
short of the unionist demand that some weapons be turned in at the
outset. Sinn Fein has made no response, but privately, leading
party officials said the governments are expecting them to deliver
the undeliverable: IRA guns.
</P>
<P>
   More fundamentally, Sinn Fein says it won seats in an election
and is entitled to take them without preconditions. In an
interview, Martin McGuiness, Sinn Fein's chief negotiator and
former IRA chief of staff, said unionist demands for a token
surrender of weapons is a smokescreen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about decommissioning. The unionists don't want
Fenians in government,'' McGuinness said, using the 19th century
term for Irish separatists, which Protestants use as a derogatory
term for Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   McGuinness said he was prepared to see the Northern Ireland
Assembly suspended, which just may happen next week if the two
sides refuse to compromise. Beginning  &UR; today &LR; , negotiations will
resume at Castle Buildings, the drab office building where last
year's historic Good Friday Agreement was hatched.
</P>
<P>
   All this is a long way from the heady days of just a year ago
when politicians here surprised the world, and even themselves, by
signing an agreement that acknowledged that Northern Ireland would
remain part of the United Kingdom, but called for reform of a
political and police system that had systematically discriminated
against Catholic nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble and the moderate nationalist leader, John Hume, shared
the Nobel Peace Prize last winter. But while a real degree of
normality has evolved, the dispute over the IRA's weapons has
stalled the effort to get politicians in Northern Ireland to run
their own affairs, something the two governments consider crucial
in proving that democratic politics offer an alternative to
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney Elliott, a political scientist at Queen's University,
said people are overreacting to the arms dispute, especially
because of the deadline set by Blair.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a process, not something dictated by deadlines,'' he
said. While Blair has warned that widespread violence could resume,
Elliott believes the major paramilitary groups will take a
wait-and-see attitude if the deadline passes.
</P>
<P>
   Seamus Mallon, the moderate nationalist who is second to Trimble
as head of the imperiled assembly, warned that politicians here had
grown complacent in the past year and were looking for others to
resolve their problems.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary people, more accustomed to their politicians bickering
than forging mutually beneficial compromises, seem worried, but no
more than usual at this perennially volatile time of year, when
tensions between Catholics and Protestants rise dramatically
because of the latter's celebrations of 17th century military
victories over Catholic forces.
</P>
<P>
   Many people seem to think the peace process is stronger than the
will of reluctant politicians. Last year, the standoff in
Portadown, where Protestant marchers have been refused permission
to parade through a Catholic neighborhood, led to major
confrontations, and the horrific firebomb murder of three Catholic
boys by Protestant extremists. A month later, republican dissidents
killed 29 people in Omagh with a car bomb, the greatest loss of
life in any single incident during the Troubles. But those
atrocities strengthened rather than weakened public support for the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Since Omagh, only eight people have been killed, five by
loyalist extremists, three by republicans. Based on the average
rate of killings in the years before the Good Friday agreement,
Hume calculates that about 100 people are alive  &UR; today &LR;  who would
have been killed in the time since the agreement was signed.
</P>
<P>
   In Belfast, where new hotels and restaurants have sprung up in
the last year, many people think it crazy to even consider throwing
the growing normality and prosperity away on so-called points of
principle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come so far,'' said Helen Scallon, who works in one of
the new hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Deehan, who heads a recycling company in Londonderry, said
the politicians should be sequestered, as they were last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should put them all in a room and make them stay there
until they come out with an agreement,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when an aide to Blair began calling around to the
various parties, saying there would be marathon talks beginning
 &UR; today &LR; , he said, only half-jokingly, ``Bring your sleeping bags.''

EDITORIAL: FIXING THE INDEPENDENT COUNSEL ACT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, June 28:
</P>
<P>
   The Independent Counsel Act will expire on Wednesday, and
unfortunately most members of Congress would just as soon see the
law fade into history. But that response unwisely assumes that
Kenneth Starr's protracted investigation of President Clinton ought
to be the measure by which the law is judged. Without an
independent counsel law, power to investigate the president and
other high officials would revert back to the attorney general, who
cannot credibly oversee inquiries into the highest levels of the
administration of which he or she is a part.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of rejecting the independent counsel mechanism, Congress
should seek to improve it. A strong bipartisan plan crafted by
Sens. Susan Collins and Arlen Specter, both Republicans, and Joseph
Lieberman and Carl Levin, Democrats, would go a long way toward
curing the weaknesses of the act, and prevent future independent
counsels from making the mistakes that marred Starr's work.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, expected to be introduced on Tuesday, would reduce the
number of positions covered by the law from roughly 200 to the
president, the vice president, Cabinet members and the White House
chief of staff. It would prohibit the expansion of an independent
counsel's jurisdiction to matters unrelated to the initial
investigation. This would prevent the kind of accretion of
unrelated allegations that turned Starr into a multipurpose
prosecutor. The bill would also limit investigations to two years,
with one-year extensions for good cause.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would require that independent counsels submit budgets
to the General Accounting Office for review to discourage
overspending. It would help prevent bias on the federal three-judge
panel that appoints independent counsels, when the attorney general
makes such a request, by picking panel members by lottery from the
federal appeals courts. There were charges that the panel that
appointed Starr was partisan. The bill would require independent
counsels to work full time, so that they would not continue to
represent paying clients as Starr did. It also eliminates a
provision in the current law that directs the independent counsel
to make judgments about what constitutes impeachable conduct, an
acceptable step toward leaving that judgment to Congress alone.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, which supported the act in 1994, now
opposes it. Starr testified to Congress this spring that the act
which has empowered him for nearly five years is hopelessly flawed.
Yet it was the combined actions of Clinton and Starr that
undermined public confidence in the independent counsel law. It
would be a disservice to the nation if Congress used their conduct
as an excuse to scrap an important mechanism that can hold top
leaders accountable for wrongdoing.

 PEACE PROCESS STALLED, BUT MANY IN ULSTER EXPECT IT TO GO ON
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   BELFAST _ Last year, when compromise finally came to Northern
Ireland, native son Seamus Heaney was moved to write that it was a
time when hope and history rhymed.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, history is not rhyming so much as repeating
itself in a place where intransigence has been widely regarded as a
strength, and compromise a sign of weakness.
</P>
<P>
   More than a year after the people of Northern Ireland
overwhelmingly approved a referendum that created structures
designed to move the conflict from the battlefield to the political
arena _ and basked in the international acclaim that followed _ the
peace process is stalled.
</P>
<P>
   The Northern Ireland Assembly, held up as the cornerstone of a
new, more equitable society, is in danger of being shelved even
before it regains the powers the British government summarily took
over in 1972 when the violence, which has killed more than 3,500
since 1969, was at its worst.
</P>
<P>
   As it has been since the Irish Republican Army called an initial
cease-fire in 1994, the sticking point is the fate of the IRA's
weapons. Protestant unionists refuse to sit in a power-sharing
government with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political representatives,
until the IRA begins disarming.
</P>
<P>
   But the Good Friday Agreement, which was reached in April 1998,
and endorsed by 71 percent of the voters in Northern Ireland and 95
percent in the Irish Republic, says only that the decommissioning
of paramilitary weapons should be completed by May 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA has categorically ruled out turning in its weapons,
saying that would amount to a surrender it did not agree to. The
IRA remembers what happened in 1969, when it was caught unarmed as
loyalist mobs overran Catholic neighborhoods, a humiliation it has
vowed will never be repeated.
</P>

impossible to build a genuine democracy, because there will always
be the threat that the IRA will go back to war if its political
representatives don't get their way.

 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Firefighter Tom Ryan walked soberly down Fifth Avenue
on Sunday, the fire commissioner at his side, the mayor a few feet
ahead, and a gyrating, feather-bedecked moving carnival of gay
Brazilians behind.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in the 29-year history of the Gay and Lesbian
Pride March, an active-duty firefighter in blue dress uniform was
marching in the parade, and the Fire Department, known for its
heavily male, tradition-bound culture, was recognizing Fireflag, a
gay firefighters' group, as an official ``line organization'' in
the parade.
</P>
<P>
   The image of a uniformed firefighter amid thousands of gay men,
lesbians, bisexuals, transvestites and transsexuals, some clad in
shorts and T-shirts, others in heels and leather thong underwear,
spoke volumes about the diversity of the gay rights movement 30
years after a police raid sparked an uprising at the Stonewall Inn
in Greenwich Village and made the Stonewall a powerful symbol of
resistance.
</P>
<P>
   It also illuminated the uneasy bond that the movement and the
establishment, once completely at odds, have formed. Twenty-nine
years ago, there was a demonstration at City Hall against allowing
homosexuals in the Fire Department _ an incident that contrasts
sharply with ``the fire commissioner and the mayor of the city
proudly marching down the avenue,'' Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was repeatedly heckled along the
parade route, particularly by a contingent of minority marchers who
were angry that he was marching close to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should be able to march as the mayor of New York City
anyplace you want,'' Giuliani said after he made his planned exit
from the parade route, ``and if people can't deal with their own
anger over that, that's really something emerging from them, from
inside them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Riordan, a spokesman for Heritage of Pride, which
organizes the parade, was unapologetic. ``Nobody is barred from
being in the parade,'' he said. ``It's completely open to all
people. He's just not popular.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other tensions. Members of a group called SexPanic!
said that near the end of the parade route, at Seventh Avenue South
and Christopher Street, the police told them to pull the group's
car, an old police car holding the self-styled ``Rudy's sex
police,'' out of the parade or face arrest because it was
``inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The police said the marchers' attire, or lack thereof, was the
problem. ``They were asked to leave the route because they were
naked, from the waist down,'' said Lt. Cory Cuneo, a police
spokesman. ``It didn't have anything to do with the police car or
anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   And soon after the parade began, a clutch of protesters, kept
safely behind a barricade, shouted at the marchers. Randall Terry,
the founder of Operation Rescue, an anti-abortion group, and of an
anti-gay group called the Resistance, said, ``We cannot pretend
this is a normal lifestyle. It is an abhorrent abomination.'' He
called Stonewall an ``anniversary of disgrace'' and said: ``Our
goal is to mobilize resistance to these people at every level. They
cannot prevail, because there is a God in heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   But by the thousands _ 700,000, according to parade organizers _
participants marched joyously. Among them were about 50 police
officers who are members of the Gay Officers Action League.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Officer Anna Marie Buckley marched next to her longtime partner,
Detective Marianne Murawski, and pushed a double stroller with
their two daughters. Each woman had one child by artificial
insemination from the same anonymous donor, Officer Buckley said.
</P>
<P>
   The contingent of police officers in the Pride March grows each
year, Officer Buckley said. ``More and more people are realizing
that the best place to be is out of the closet,'' she said.
``People criticize you less, they ridicule you less.''
</P>
<P>
   Officer Buckley said the attitude of the Police Department
toward gay men and lesbians had improved considerably since she
joined the department eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And Thomas Von Essen, the fire commissioner, said he was
determined to bring his department along the same route.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our department is a very male-dominated group of people, and
it's important for them to be rough and tough,'' he said. That
makes them brave, he said, but not always accepting of those who
are different.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 1999,'' he continued. ``These firefighters have proven
they are just as competent, just as determined to do as good a job,
and they deserve the respect of everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, the only firefighter among 8,800 in New York City who has
publicly declared that he is gay, said he had a ``very, very''
difficult time after he came out a year ago, and some friends in
the department turned their backs on him. But he is undeterred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping to show young people struggling in their sexuality
that they can grow up to be a fireman or a cop,'' Ryan said, ``that
they can have the same hopes and dreams as any other little kid.''
</P>
<P>
   The parade was a tapestry of stories and a tableau of images.
Members of one leather-clad group stopped periodically along the
route for demonstrations of sadism and masochism, whipping one
another. The police officers lining the route watched them
stoically, as they did the women who marched topless.
</P>
<P>
   The sounds of the parade _ a variety of music, including salsa
and reggae _ told another story, that of the growing number of
immigrants for whom coming out is an American rite of passage.
Among them was Bassam Kassab, 30, a graduate student in Boston who
is from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   When his mother, Aida, arrived for a visit from Lebanon two
weeks ago, she did not know that he was gay, he said. But on
Friday, as he drove to New York, he narrowly avoided a serious
accident. He pulled into a rest stop and called his mother, who was
still in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ```I almost died,''' he said he told her, ```and there's
something I haven't told you for 15 years: I'm gay.'''
</P>
<P>
   Her response, he said, was immediate: ```You should have told me
a long time ago, because that's how you are born, I would have
supported you, and you wouldn't have lived in misery for 15
years.'''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, members of Karama, the New England Lavender Arab
Society, pulled her along the parade route in a cart on which had
been pasted a hand-lettered sign: ``Proud Lebanese Gay's Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Benov, 67, was another proud mother marching, if a bereft
one. Two of her four sons were gay; both died in 1990 of
complications from AIDS. ``We have to be here for them, for their
memories,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On Stonewall's 30th anniversary, she contemplated life before
Stonewall, when gay men could be arrested based on how they walked
or dressed or sought companionship.
</P>
<P>
   ``How grateful I am that my sons didn't have to go through
that,'' she said.

JETER SITS, BUT SOJO HOMERS AS YANKS DOWN ORIOLES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Before batting in the ninth inning Sunday, Luis Sojo
turned to teammates on the New York Yankees' bench and predicted he
would hit a home run, which is like Ross Perot guaranteeing he is
going to be elected president or Larry Johnson promising he is
going to utter something noncontroversial. Sojo had not hit a home
run in nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
   Lo and behold, Sojo whacked Arthur Rhodes' slider into the
left-field stands, ensuring the Yankees' 6-2 victory against
Baltimore _ a fitting end to this road trip for the Yankees, who
won all six games, against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and the fading
Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had been struggling for runs when they left New York
a week ago, and in six games their offense exploded. They batted
.377, scored eight runs per game and bashed 11 home runs, including
two by Bernie Williams Sunday, his 12th and 13th of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the slumping Yankees saw their batting averages ascend
with the alacrity of America Online stock. Chuck Knoblauch went
from .249 to .262, Paul O'Neill from .272 to .286, Tino Martinez
from .252 to .276 and Williams from .324 to .341.
</P>
<P>
   Their starting pitching has been terrific, and Mariano Rivera
has succeeded in 20 of his 21 save chances. Derek Jeter sat out
Sunday's game because of a cramp in his hamstring and Sojo, his
replacement, slammed a home run. The Yankees (45-28) are playing
their best baseball of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the type of streak we look for,'' said Joe Torre, the
manager. ``And hopefully, we'll have more.''
</P>
<P>
   They have beaten Orioles (32-42) 36 of the last 58 games in
Baltimore in the 1990s. But the Yankees' lead Sunday was in
jeopardy into the eighth inning. Orlando Hernandez (9-6) gave up
two runs early, throwing 30 pitches in the third inning. He was
tentative, Torre thought, as if he were pitching ``the seventh game
of the World Series'' _ and at one point, he seemed unsure what to
throw, shaking off catcher Joe Girardi repeatedly. Hernandez
settled to retire 11 straight batters, from the fourth inning
through the seventh, but his pitch count reached 112 after seven
innings, with the Yankees leading, 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Bordick, B.J. Surhoff and Albert Belle, Baltimore's Nos. 2,
3 and 4 batters, were due to hit in the eighth, and the left-hander
Mike Stanton warmed up in the Yankees' bullpen. Torre could let
Hernandez pitch to Bordick and then call on Stanton to face the
left-handed-hitting Surhoff, or leave Hernandez in the game to face
the first three hitters and then, if needed, Stanton could pitch to
the Nos. 5 and 6 batters, left-handers Harold Baines and Will
Clark. Torre was well aware, of course, that Baines had bashed
Stanton's fastball for a three-run homer Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Torre determined to keep Hernandez in the game for the three
batters. After going ahead no balls and two strikes on Bordick,
Hernandez walked Bordick, and Surhoff singled. Two on and nobody
out for Belle, Baines and Clark, the lead only one run.
</P>
<P>
   Torre stayed with his plan, Hernandez pitching to Belle; he had
struck out Belle in the first inning. This time, Hernandez
challenged Belle with fastballs and whiffed him on four pitches,
the last a 94-mile-an-hour fastball. Torre went to the mound to
replace Hernandez, who shook his manager's hand and then stopped in
front of the stands to bow slightly and doff his cap.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton warmed up and felt his fastball was subpar, so he went
after Baines with consecutive curveballs. Baines took the first for
a strike, swung at the second and pulled a grounder toward the
first-base hole.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez had seen Girardi set his target outside, guessed
Stanton would throw a breaking ball and figured Baines would hit
the ball in his direction. Surhoff, leading off first, waited for
an instant, trying to block Martinez's view, but the first baseman
saw the ball, dived to his right and gloved it. Martinez threw to
second base for a forceout on Surhoff, and Sojo fired to first with
Surhoff bearing down on him.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton was there, the throw arrived _ and Baines was safe.
There were two outs, the potential tying run at third and Baines at
first as the possible lead run. Stanton turned his attention to
Clark, throwing breaking balls again, until the count was 2-2. He
spun a slider, Clark struck out and the Yankees in the dugout began
clapping. A crisis averted. Stanton, Hernandez would say later, was
magnificent.
</P>
<P>
   Sojo was to be the Yankees' third batter in the ninth inning,
and he was taking good-natured grief from Jeter, Jorge Posada and
others for his weak swings. He turned to them and said, ``I'm going
to hit the ball out of here,'' and they laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes struck out the first two batters, throwing his fastball
94 to 95 mph. With a 1-2 count, Rhodes chose to throw a slider _
``He was doing me a favor,'' Sojo said _ and Sojo turned on it,
driving it into the seats, his first home run since July 30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Sojo kept his smile in check until he crossed home plate, turned
toward the dugout and saw Jeter waiting for him _ and the grin
broke through, the face of the Yankees on this road trip.

TWO MORE SETBACKS FOR ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ If it weren't for bad luck perhaps the Anaheim
Angels would have no luck at all. On Sunday the team learned the
bad news about two more players, Tim Belcher and Matt Luke.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials said Sunday that X-rays done on Belcher's right
hand indicate he suffered a fracture in his pinky finger and his
status is day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher hurt his hand making a play at first Saturday against
the Oakland A's. He left the game after pitching four innings.
</P>
<P>
   As for Luke, the right fielder had a partial tear of the right
oblique muscle, which is located just below the rib cage. He tore
the muscle Friday against Oakland making a throw from right field
in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Luke is the 13th Angel placed on the DL this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting silly,'' Angels manager Terry Collins said.
``Matt Luke just got into the lineup and boom, like that he's
out.''
</P>
<P>
   In eight games for the Angels in 1999, Luke batted .438 with
three runs scored, two home runs and four RBI. His replacement will
be Mike Holtz, from the Triple-A Edmonton farm team.
</P>
<P>
   Holtz, a left-handed pitcher, was 2-1 with one save and a 2.66
ERA in 18 games at Edmonton. Earlier in the season he was with the
Angels and posted a 1-1 record with a 1.42 ERA in 10 games before
he was optioned.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher's injury comes at a time when Collins is struggling to
keep his squad healthy. It could be a tough blow to take in light
of the elbow injury to starter Ken Hill earlier in the week against
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   For now the team is going with a modified four-man rotation.
Chuck Finley (4-7, 4.56 ERA) will get the start today and Omar
Olivares will take the mound Tuesday night against the Texas
Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   As for Belcher?
</P>
<P>
   ``For sure he won't pitch for a while,'' Collins said. ``And on
top of that we're going to have to wait on Kenny Hill. Still,
there's a lot of options at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   No place like home: West Covina native Jason Giambi invited his
father John into the A's clubhouse Sunday. He admitted he was glad
to be home, if only for a few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like playing here,'' Jason said. ``The family all comes out
and it's fun. It's nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheets gets chance: Andy Sheets got the start for the Angels at
short Sunday against Oakland and pitcher Kenny Rogers. He was there
largely because starter Gary DiSarcina is 3-44 lifetime against
Rogers, which adds up to a batting average of .068.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to give him (the day off),'' Collins said. ``I
compare Rogers to (Gary) Maddux and those type guys. It's not easy
against him. He's the type of hitter who, when he gets ahead of
you, he can expand the strike zone and that's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers ahead: Going into Sunday's game, the Angels were already
assured of winning the series against the A's, and Collins hoped to
do the same against the first-place Texas Rangers in the three-game
series that begins tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like I keep saying, we need to win series right now,''
Collins said. ``And after a couple of weeks we can look up at the
standings and see that we're in striking distance.''

   (NYT15) NEW YORK -- June 27, 1999 -- PAPER-WASSERSTEIN-2, 6-27
-- Executives at the offices of The Daily Deal. The Daily Deal
which is set to start a five-day-a-week publication on Sept. 15.,
has some built-in advantages. For one, the newspaper is American
Lawyer Media's 22d publication. There is also little question it
will have deals to cover, at least for now. In 1996, the total
value of domestic mergers and acquisitions was $653 billion; in
1997 it was $970 billion; last year, it jumped to $1.6 trillion.

   (NYT13) PORTERVILLE, Calif. -- June 27, 1999 -- CALIF-CITRUS-2,
6-27 -- A citrus grove in Porterville is still suffering from the
effects of a winter storm last year, with many oranges lying
ruined, their pulp as dry as straw. Last Christmas a storm
destroyed $700 million worth of crops in the fertile Central Valley
of California, and also left 14,000 to 28,000 people out of work.
With the sunlight pressing on the valley like a hot compress, the
damage from the freeze is getting worse. (Monica Almeida/New York

6-27 -- Unemployed grove workers line up for boxes of food,
distributed by the National Farmworkers Service Center in
Porterville. Most people in the fertile Central Valley of
California depend on the citrus crop, and as it has failed, the
town has been hit hard. Growers and packing-house owners are up to
their chins in debt; workers are up to their eyes in it. (Monica

   (NYT11) NEW YORK -- June 27, 1999 -- REMNICK-NEWYORKER-MEDIA,
6-27 -- David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker magazine and
Pulitzer Prize winning author. The author of four books, including
``Lenin's Tomb,'' which won the 1994 Pulitzer Prize, Remnick favors
longer pieces and has added more local political coverage, more
international political coverage, more criticism, even more words
in general, but little of it has generated the noisy, often
outraged clamor in the news media that many advertisers appreciate.

People attending the Gay Pride Parade on Sunday celebrate in front
of the Stonewall Inn on Christopher Street, where the parade began
in 1970 as a grassroots commemoration of the 1969 Stonewall Riots.
Millions of members of the gay community turned out to celebrate
their pride in New York on Sunday. The Stonewall Riots began when
patrons of a gay bar in Greenwich Village fought back against a
police raid in 1969. (Billy Smith 2d/New York Times Photo)

6-27 -- Serbs in Urosevic, fearful of reprisals from Kosovo
Albanians, wait outside NATO headquarters for a bus to take them to
Pristina. NATO hopes the arrival of 3,600 Russian peacekeepers will
make Serbs feel safer in Kosovo, but reports of revenge attacks by
ethnic Albanians continue. (Stephen Crowley/New York Times Photo)

6-27 -- Fred West, director of Seattle's City Cantabile Choir,
plays the flute for Orca whales on the waters of northern Puget
Sound, during a concert at sea for the whales. In the audience,
there was no clapping of hands and no standing ovation, but the
killer whales, also known as orcas, showed up, nearly surrounding
the boat at times, cutting the surface of the water, their
black-and-white coloring spectacularly visible. (Larry Davis/New

Sen. John B. Breaux, 55, D-La., says he is pushing forward with his
Medicare proposal in the Senate. Breaux seems an unlikely player in
the Medicare debate, which tends to have its own wonky priesthood
steeped in the arcane liturgy of managed competition. This is,
after all, a man who takes his identity with Louisiana seriously.
He includes favorite recipes on his official Senate Web site and
never misses a Mardi Gras, which he celebrates lavishly both in
Washington and in New Orleans. (Shana Raab/New York Times Photo)

-- A British paratrooper tries to stamp out part of a fire caused
by Molotov cocktails thrown at a Serb owned cafe on Sunday. The
latest weekend of murder, arson and looting in the devastated
southern Serbian province, highlights the vacuum created when Serb
forces withdrew from Kosovo earlier this month, leaving the region
without a civilian force to maintain law and order. (Alan Chin/New

   (NYT5) SLOVINJE, Yugoslavia -- June 27, 1999 --
KOSOVO-VILLAGE-2, 6-27 -- An Albanian man stands in front of a
British base in Slovinje, where a small detachment of British
soldiers have been trying to hold this mixed community together. In
Slovinje, Serbs and Albanians had lived in relative harmony for
decades. But this village was not spared the last three months of
war. The hate and fear that British forces now see and feel here,
they say, resembles what they encountered in Northern Ireland. In
both places, they argue, their presence at least limits the
violence. (Alan Chin/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT4) SLOVINJE, Yugoslavia -- June 27, 1999 --
KOSOVO-VILLAGE-1, 6-27 -- As many Serb families stream out of
Slovinje, Jasnina Stanisic, 23, at left, gives the Serbian national
salute. Mileva, 48, at right, is her mother and the driver is a
family friend. Jasnina's brother, Zoran, 20, was recently kidnapped
and is still missing. Despite continuous British patrols in
Slovinje, where some of the village's original 40 or so Serb
families remain, Serbs complain that NATO soldiers have not been
protecting them. (Alan Chin/New York Times Photo)

KOSOVO-KLA-FLOATER, 6-27 -- A Kosovo Liberation Army soldier

the KLA is to tell NATO how much equipment they have and where it

KOSOVO-BOMB-DAMAGE-2, 6-27 -- Hajdar Kameri, an ethnic Albanian,
chops up wood in Djakovica, an area once believed to be a Serb
military base. From blown-out military barracks to exploded fuel
tanks, the devastating results of NATO's bombing are obvious all
across Kosovo. But the damage brought down on the Yugoslav army
itself -- particularly the tanks, armored fighting vehicles and
artillery batteries at its core -- is less clear. (Tyler Hicks/New

   (NYT1) DJAKOVICA, Yugoslavia -- June 27, 1999 --
KOSOVO-BOMB-DAMAGE-1, 6-27 -- Ethnic Albanians walk past a crater
at a junkyard in Djakovica, once believed to be a Serb military
base, which was bombed by NATO. While some vehicles were removed
from Kosovo by Serb forces to break down for spare parts, NATO
officials themselves acknowledge that fewer pieces of military
hardware were destroyed than the alliance had first estimated.

at a junkyard in Djakovica, once believed to be a Serb military
base, which was bombed by NATO. While some vehicles were removed
from Kosovo by Serb forces to break down for spare parts, NATO
officials themselves acknowledge that fewer pieces of military
hardware were destroyed than the alliance had first estimated.

EDITORIAL: REALISTIC RULES ON COMPUTER EXPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, June 28:
</P>
<P>
   There are good reasons for restricting American exports of
high-performance computers to countries that might put them to
dangerous military use. Computing power is increasingly vital to
the production of advanced nuclear and conventional weapons and
missiles. Last month's Cox Committee report details the potential
dangers to national security from overly permissive computer export
rules.
</P>
<P>
   But in designing export-control rules, Washington must also
recognize that considerable computer power is now widely and
cheaply available from desktop and laptop personal computers.
Obsolete definitions of high performance make a mockery of export
restrictions by controlling the sale of mass-production computers
easily available to buyers almost anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is now considering a significant increase in
the power of computers that can be exported to some 100 countries
across Eastern Europe and the Third World. Computers that powerful
should not be freely exported to China. But a far more modest
increase in the cutoff for China and other militarily sensitive
countries, to take effect six months from now, would also make
sense.
</P>
<P>
   The government measures computing power in units called MTOPS,
which stands for millions of theoretical operations per second.
Washington must now be notified of any export to countries like
China of computers rated 2,000 MTOPS or higher. By next year,
personal computers rated above 2,000 are likely to be available for
less than $3,000 at retail malls. It is futile to restrict exports
of such machines.
</P>
<P>
   The right response to the advance of technology is not to give
up on export controls, but to keep them up to date. Even with the
rapid advances in personal computers, the best of them have only
about one-thousandth of the computing power of the supercomputers
now used in America's weapons labs. There is plenty of room to set
realistic thresholds and still protect advanced computer
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton should lift all restrictions on exports to China of
computers rated below 7,000 MTOPS. Any change would be subject to
congressional review and take six months to go into effect, so
Clinton should begin the process right away. The Cox Commission
report rightly heightened administration and congressional
sensitivity to the dangers of selling militarily useful technology
to China. But the place to draw the line is not at the level of
next year's personal computers.  &QL;

BRAVES' MADDUX IS TOO MUCH FOR METS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ His time had passed. So said Greg Maddux's critics
earlier this season. They were obviously wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux pitched the Atlanta Braves to a 1-0 victory over the New
York Mets Sunday afternoon in a 2-hour-6-minute game in which he
displayed all his old trademarks: precision, speed and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old right-hander had also demonstrated to the Mets
that while they might be closer than ever to challenging the Braves
this season, they still have some distance to go after dropping the
weekend series, two games to one.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux (7-5) tossed eight shutout innings of two-hit ball,
outdueling an aching Masato Yoshii (6-6) and sending the Mets to a
series against Florida at Miami four games behind the Braves in the
National League East.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you listen to our announcers, you'd think he's been
terrible,'' Braves manager Bobby Cox said of Maddux, his longtime
ace, whose ERA was an uncharacteristic 4.65 just four starts ago.
``But he's had a bunch of games like today's.''
</P>
<P>
   They have just been fewer than in seasons past. But even though
Maddux lowered his ERA to 3.87, he needed help from the Braves' new
closer, John Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   Why remove Maddux after just 93 pitches? ``He said, `I'm a
little tired,''' Cox said. ``And when he indicates that, he's
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux departed after striking out pinch-hitter Matt Franco on a
full-count changeup to end the eighth inning with the tying run on
third base. ``I'm just aiming it down the middle and hoping it
doesn't end up there,'' Maddux said. ``I'm serious. A coach told me
that when I was 13 or 14 and it still works. But I was tiring.''
</P>
<P>
   So on came Rocker to pitch the ninth. And again the Mets _ who
had just six runners on base the entire game _ put the tying run in
scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   Edgardo Alfonzo rifled a one-out single into center field.
Pinch-runner Melvin Mora took second on John Olerud's grounder as
Atlanta first baseman Brian Hunter slipped while fielding the ball.
And then the Braves intentionally walked Mike Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   The right-handed-hitting Piazza is batting .377 against
left-handers. Rocker is left-handed. And the left-handed-hitting
Robin Ventura, who was batting .281 against lefties, was due up
next.
</P>
<P>
   Mets manager Bobby Valentine figured the Braves would have
walked Piazza even if the Mets had only had a runner on first. Cox
said he wouldn't have gone that far. ``But the thing that made it
tough was that Ventura hits left-handers so well,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   But the hard-throwing Rocker, after getting ahead of Ventura on
the strength of his fastball, fooled him with 1-2 breaking ball.
Ventura swung and missed. and Rocker had picked up his 16th save in
19 opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Maddux was asked what impresses him most about
Rocker. ``Changing speeds,'' said Maddux, who might be the best
ever at just that. ``A lot of guys throw hard, but not many know
how to change speeds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's totally wasted,'' Valentine said of
Yoshii's seven-inning, four-hit, one-run effort. ``He can build on
it. Sometimes you just run up against a buzzsaw. Yoshii just made
one more mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii, who strained his right quadriceps warming up for the
game, said he was excited about the prospect of facing Maddux, a
four-time Cy Young award winner.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux retired the first 14 Mets he faced, but then Brian McRae
and Roger Cedeno laced consecutive singles in the fourth. Rey
Ordonez grounded out, however, to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Yoshii, who had been fitted with a knee brace, did
all he could to keep up the brisk pace. But with Eddie Perez on
second and two out in the third, Ozzie Guillen lunged at a 2-2
forkball at his feet. It was not in the dirt, as Valentine had
wanted it. ``But when he hit it, I thought it was going to be a
routine fly ball to center,'' Yoshii said through his interpreter.
Instead, it was a run-scoring double that found the gap in
right-center. And Maddux made the run stand up.
</P>
<P>
   Before the series even began, Cox had criticized the schedule
makers for making the Braves and Mets wait until late June to face
each other. The Mets now must feel the same. Because while it might
have taken the heretofore struggling Tom Glavine and Maddux a
couple of months to adjust to the new strike zone, they both shut
the Mets down this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   And so, what did the teams learn about each other that they
didn't know before? Nothing yet, said Cox. ``I don't know,''
Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Others said they learned more.
</P>
<P>
   `That the Braves are still a very good team,'' Mets general
manager Steve Phillips said. ``And so are we.''
</P>
<P>
   McRae put it another way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a better team than we were last year,'' he said. ``But
they're not as bad as people want to make them out to be.''

`AGAINST THE TIDE': BEACH HOUSE UP, BEACH HOUSE DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By ANN FINKBEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   My night-school geology professor explained how the wired-rock
walls and straightened banks of nearby Stony Run just let the
stream run faster so that downstream, erosion gets worse. And true,
right where the wired-rock walls stop, next to a monumentally
graceless apartment house, Stony Run's banks are gouged out and
raw.
</P>
<P>
   I have a dream. No one is going to notice those banks cutting
back, deeper with each storm, until they fatally undermine the
apartment house and it crumbles into Stony Run. The point here is,
water always wins.
</P>
<P>
   The point is the same for American beaches. Humans are drawn to
beaches: Our ancestors hauled themselves out of the ocean, crawled
up on the sand and, eventually, built beach houses. Even the Bible
says this was not smart: a foolish man ``built his house upon the
sand: and the rain descended, the floods came, and the winds blew
and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of
it'' (Matthew 7:26-27).
</P>
<P>
   Cornelia Dean, science editor for The New York Times, writes in
``Against the Tide: The Battle for America's Beaches'' about the
reasons those houses fall, the measures taken to prevent their
falling again, the failure of those measures, and solutions for the
whole soggy mess. Ms. Dean begins with the deadly 1900 Galveston
hurricane. On Sept. 8, the local newspaper had a news item on a
storm moving across the Gulf of Mexico. On Sept. 9, the same paper
consisted of a single page bearing two columns of names that began,
``Following is a list of dead as accurately as News men have been
able to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Galveston is on a beach _ actually a barrier island, a narrow
strip of sand built and maintained by the ocean _ and the hurricane
simply swamped it; more than 6,000 people died. Afterward,
Galveston built a seawall against the ocean three miles long, later
expanded to six. The wall has held off not only subsequent
hurricanes but also the sand with which the ocean once replenished
the beaches. So Galveston now markets itself not for its absent
beaches but for its famous hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   This state of affairs repeats itself on nearly all American
beaches. Mountains, meadows and apartment buildings are washed away
and eventually ground into sand. Some of the sand is dumped into
sandbars offshore, some ends up on beaches. Storm waves carry sand
from the beaches back to the sandbars and quiet waves bring it
again to the beaches, so the beaches narrow and widen, erode and
return. They are not so much beaches as cycles.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s and '80s nearly half of all construction in America
was on or near the coastline. To protect our houses, roads and
T-shirt shops, we've armored our beaches with seawalls,
breakwaters, jetties, groins and bulkheads. The armor, in place
after place _ Long Island, Hilton Head, Palm Beach, Santa Monica _
interferes with the cycle of sand and waves, and generally wipes
out the beaches. We truck in another beach from elsewhere;
sometimes we just do without the beach. Most eastern and southern
beaches are narrow barrier islands through which storms routinely
cut new inlets. Boats from the inland side have a nice new route to
the ocean, so bridges, roads and marinas get built.
</P>
<P>
   But the sand keeps flowing, carried not only by waves but also
by a longshore current of sorts called a littoral drift. To keep
sand from closing the inlets, people build groins jutting out into
the ocean, on the up-current side of the littoral drift. And sure
enough, the inlet stays open because sand piles up on the
up-current side of the groin.
</P>
<P>
   But now the down-current side doesn't get its usual sand flow,
and each storm erodes more beach. So the down-current people
complain, and the up-current people build big blowers and blow
their excess sand over the inlet to the down-current beaches, from
which _ to everyone's surprise _ it again erodes. If someone's
watching from Mars, we must look like nitwits.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three approaches to coastal erosion,'' Ms. Dean
writes. ``Armor, beach nourishment and retreat.'' By the time she
finishes, the reader has no doubt which she supports. The first two
approaches are short-term and high-maintenance, and people who use
them _ those who make up what she calls ``a constituency of
ignorance'' _ would rather ignore the water-wins rule than lose
their investments. Ms. Dean advocates the third approach, retreat.
The solution she likes best is when the National Park Service or
the Nature Conservancy or a private billionaire buys the beaches
and lays down the law: Enjoy the beach, just don't build on it.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the usual environmental book, a genre whose
reduction of nature's complexity to a simple-minded battle between
nobility and greed easily arouses the curmudgeon. If it's good
enough for dinosaurs, the reader snarls, it's good enough for
spotted owls. The snarl _ my snarl, anyway _ is mostly suspicion
that such advocacy skews the story. But Ms. Dean is smarter than
that; she knows that the best advocacy is to lay out the whole
story, all sides, fairly and neutrally, and bet that readers will
see what she sees.
</P>
<P>
   She also doesn't pretend the problem is simple. Coastal
geologists understand any given beach, but each beach is different.
Armor won't necessarily destroy a beach or destroy it wholly.
Decisions about the beaches are made by so many people _ federal
agencies, state governments, developers, the Corps of Engineers,
lawyers, insurance companies, property owners, environmentalists,
coastal geologists _ they have trouble agreeing on the problem let
alone on the solution. The constituency of ignorance might be
geologically short-sighted, understandably influenced by politics
and finances and not terrifically bright, but it is mostly composed
of people who love their beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dean has made her case so clearly and cleanly, with such
persuasive examples, and so much credit where it is due, that I'm
convinced. Let the Stony Run apartment house fall, I cry. Save the
spotted owl.

TV STATION'S LIBEL TRIAL REVISITS OLD MURDER CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANDREW BLUTH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ When Dennis Stokes, a Minnesota Mining and
Manufacturing executive, was shot to death in 1993 in a nearby
suburb, Forest Lake, an Anoka County detective gave his theory of
the murder to a local television station: It appeared Stokes'
widow, Terri, killed her husband with a shotgun blast while he
slept in their bed.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, Ms. Stokes has not been charged with the crime
and says she has spent the better part of six years fending off
media and police inquiries into what, if any, role she played in
the murder. Hoping to escape the spotlight, she says, she moved to
Idaho; but now she is back in it, trying to erase what she contends
were false accusations.
</P>
<P>
   The murder is now being relived in a Minneapolis courtroom where
Ms. Stokes has sued the detective, the county and WCCO-TV, a
station owned by CBS, for libel. The trial is being closely watched
by the news media and the legal profession.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute centers around an interview shown in an April 1994
news broadcast in which the detective, Tom Johnson, said Ms. Stokes
was the only suspect and described the evidence that pointed to
her.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Stokes was not arrested and no one was ever charged with
the crime. In her suit, Ms. Stokes contends that Johnson had become
obsessed with his suspicions of her and that he failed to
acknowledge exculpatory evidence. As a result, she argues, the
detective focused his investigation too narrowly on her.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the liability of Johnson and the county, media law
experts say that holding a news organization liable for the words
of a public official speaking on the record could pose an
unsettling precedent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major issue for those of us in the media who on a
regular basis rely on public sources to talk about issues on the
record,'' said Bill Babcock, director of the Silha Center for the
Study of Media Ethics and Law at the University of Minnesota. ``If
the media can be held liable for reporting what a public official
has said on the record, to say it would have a chilling effect on
the media would be too mild. It would be devastating. If we can't
report on what is the public record and what is being said by
public officials, what can we report on?''
</P>
<P>
   Circumstances have also turned this civil defamation suit into
more of a murder trial. To make their case, defense lawyers are
trying to show that Johnson's statements were true. They will
review Ms. Stokes' extramarital affairs and argue that she stood to
gain financially by her husband's death.
</P>
<P>
   Media experts have pointed to a series of cases in Minnesota and
nationwide that have gone against news organizations and say
another could be detrimental.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very important case for news organizations and
particularly television stations,'' Lucy Dalglish, a media lawyer
in Minneapolis and former reporter, said. ``Plaintiffs are now
saying, `I don't care if it's an official source. I don't care
where your information came from _ if it's false, you're not going
to be able to stand behind it anymore.'''
</P>
<P>
   The defense has already lost several key battles, most notably a
ruling last fall denying a defense motion to dismiss the case.
</P>
<P>
   Federal District Judge David Doty rejected the defense's
contention that repeating statements in the public record or made
by government officials is protected speech. The judge called the
broadcast ``highly slanted'' and said the reporter failed to
adequately question the detective's exaggerated statements.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the trial began, Ms. Stokes settled with another
defendant, King World Productions, which included an interview with
Johnson on its ``American Journal'' program in December 1994.
Several other defendants were also dropped from the case before the
trial, which began last week and is expected to last a month.

KURT WEILL'S HERITAGE: HONOR REPLACES SCORN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHEMNITZ, Germany _ For lovers of great melodies, Kurt Weill is
the composer of ``Mack the Knife'' and ``September Song.'' For fans
of 1940s musical comedies, he wrote the scores of ``Street Scene''
and ``One Touch of Venus.'' For opera goers, he bequeathed at least
two classics to the modern repertory with ``The Threepenny Opera''
and ``The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet in this eastern German industrial city, where celebrations
of next year's 100th anniversary of Weill's birth began with a
flourish this month, the multitalented German-born composer is
being remembered above all as a Jew, a seemingly peculiar reminder
that it was Weill's very Jewish identity that forced him to flee
Germany in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The two-season centennial was nonetheless inaugurated with the
Old Testament pageant opera ``The Eternal Road,'' Weill's only work
written from a strictly Jewish point of view. The production, the
opera's first since 1937, will return to Chemnitz in November and
then go in early 2000 to the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York,
the New Israeli Opera in Tel Aviv and the Opera Krakow in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   How ``The Eternal Road'' became a highlight of the ``Kurt Weill
2000'' program reveals more about Chemnitz today than about Weill
in his lifetime. Weill himself, who died in 1950, probably never
set foot here. And after he fled Germany in 1933, he made a point
of never returning. Yet with this production, Chemnitz has turned
him into a powerful symbol of its campaign to make amends for past
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   When the Nazis took power in January 1933, the city's 350,000
inhabitants included a thriving community of some 3,500 Jews. By
the time the city's synagogue was burned down on Kristallnacht,
Nov. 9, 1938, most Jews had fled and some had been arrested. In
1945, when Chemnitz became part of East Germany, there were 59
Jewish survivors living here. And when Germany was reunited in
1990, the Jewish community was down to just 17 people.
</P>
<P>
   For Chemnitz, renamed Karl-Marx-Stadt by the Communists, the
past had become a void because, while West Germany showed penitence
for the Holocaust, East Germany denied all responsibility for the
Nazis' barbarities. It was only when Chemnitz began to reflect on
life before 1933 that it recognized an outstanding debt to Jews and
understood what was lost with the destruction of its Jewish
community. Courageously, the city decided to act.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, the municipal council instituted annual Days of
Jewish Culture, with concerts, plays and lectures, to which it
began inviting Jews who fled Chemnitz in the '30s.
</P>
<P>
   The city informed the German government that it would welcome
Jewish migrants from the East, notably Russia (it now has some 300
Jewish residents). And, instigated by the Social Democratic mayor,
Peter Seifert, the city decided to build a $6 million synagogue.
And it was this project that led to ``The Eternal Road.''
</P>
<P>
   The opera _ it is also often described as a Jewish oratorio _
takes place in a synagogue where a Jewish community is seeking
refuge from a pogrom. To give heart to the Jews, the rabbi begins
reading from the Torah. He conjures images from the Old Testament,
including familiar stories of Abraham, Moses, David, Solomon and
the Prophets, which are then enacted onstage. Finally, soldiers
drive the Jews from the synagogue, but they are consoled by the
promised coming of the Messiah.
</P>
<P>
   The opera was born of a suggestion by the American producer
Meyer Weisgal that the renowned German director Max Reinhardt put
together a musical drama based on the Old Testament. Reinhardt
turned to Weill for the score and Franz Werfel for the
German-language libretto. The three, all Jews already in exile,
worked on the project from 1934 to 1936.
</P>
<P>
   Titled ``Der Weg der Verheissung,'' or ``The Road of Promise,''
the opera was renamed ``The Eternal Road'' in its English
translation. And eventually, after immense difficulties, it had its
premiere at the Manhattan Opera House in New York on Jan. 7, 1937
(with Weill's wife, Lotte Lenya, in the cast). It was a critical
success but a commercial flop, and it closed after 153
performances.
</P>
<P>
   For Weill it was a transitional work between his German life and
his American life, between what have become known as the ``Two
Weills.'' In Germany he was known as an avant-garde composer whose
main theater works _ ``The Threepenny Opera,'' ``Mahagonny'' and
``Seven Deadly Sins'' _ were written to librettos by Bertolt
Brecht.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, where Weill settled in 1935, he adjusted
quickly and successfully to the demands of Broadway musicals, with
Ira Gershwin, Langston Hughes and Alan Jay Lerner among his
librettists. ``The Eternal Road,'' meanwhile, literally
disappeared, its orchestral score long believed lost.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, when Rolf Stiska was assistant director of the
Berliner Ensemble, the theater company founded by Brecht, his
research into the Weill-Brecht partnership led him to the opera.
Subsequently, as assistant director of the Berlin Staatsoper, he
suggested presenting it. And when he was appointed director of the
Theater Chemnitz in 1992, he brought the idea with him. But it was
Chemnitz's new interest in its Jewish past, along with talk of a
new synagogue, that suddenly made a production of ``The Eternal
Road'' seem viable.
</P>
<P>
   It would not prove simple. Weill's musical legacy is effectively
controlled by the New York-based Kurt Weill Foundation, which was
not immediately persuaded that an opera house in a little-known
German city was the right place for a revival of ``The Eternal
Road.'' Long negotiations followed, with the foundation insisting
on the right to approve the production's conductor, director,
designer and principal soloists as well as any changes in the
libretto.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all very complicated,'' recalled Karl-Hans Moeller, the
theater's chief dramaturge and Chemnitz's chief negotiator. ``The
foundation also wanted Israel and the Brooklyn Academy of Music
involved. It said it wanted an experienced conductor and mentioned
John Mauceri, who had done a lot of Weill before. I had never heard
of Mauceri and he had never heard of Chemnitz, but it worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauceri, principal conductor of the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra,
was delighted. ``It was Chemnitz that made it happen after I had
spent 15 years trying to get others to do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting production team is appropriately international:
Mauceri is American; the director, Michael Heinicke, is German; the
set and costume designer, David Shahir, is Israeli; and, bolstering
Oper Chemnitz's 56-member chorus, the 140-strong chorus includes
singers from the Opera Krakow and the Leipzig Synagogue Choir
(formed mainly by non-Jews interested in Jewish religious music).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   With its huge cast, frequent costume changes and complex
re-enactments of Biblical scenes _ from worship of the golden calf
to Moses and the burning bush _ ``The Eternal Road'' comes across
as a powerful visual spectacle. Where this production differs from
the 1937 version and Werfel's text, though, is that when the
uniformed men invade the synagogue, they now shoot a character
called the Adversary, who sacrifices his life to save the Torah.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to change the end because we couldn't pretend that
Auschwitz did not happen,'' Moeller explained. ``When the opera was
written in the mid-1930s, even though things were bad for Jews, no
one had yet imagined the Holocaust. But we now know that the Jews
weren't just allowed to leave to continue their wandering. We
didn't want to show the camps, so we added the shot and the
death.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as the story builds to an emotional climax, so does Weill's
score grow in strength as the drama unfolds. At times, the music is
rich in references _ to ``Don Giovanni,'' to ``Nabucco,'' to Wagner
and Mahler, even to Weill's own rendering of American jazz _ but it
also takes on a grandeur of its own. Comparing it with an earlier
work, Weill himself described it as ``much stronger, richer, more
varied _ more Mozartean.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Weill is telling an eternal Jewish story, but he is also
saying goodbye to Germany by placing it within the tradition of
great German ecclesiastical music,'' Mauceri said. ``I believe the
echoes of Bach, Handel, Mozart, Wagner are all intentional. The
wonderful thing about Weill is that he was not afraid of being
popular. I think he disappointed the critics because his music did
not get progressively more complex.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, before and after the 100th anniversary of Weill's birth
on March 2, 2000, and the 50th anniversary of his death on April 3
next year, there will be ample opportunity to judge both his
symphonic and his theatrical music.
</P>
<P>
   Already last month, Weill's 1931 opera, ``Die Buergschaft,'' had
its U.S. premiere at the Spoleto Festival in Charleston, S.C. In
New York next year, along with the six performances of ``The
Eternal Road'' at the Brooklyn Academy in late February and early
March, the New York Philharmonic will play a concert sequence from
``Street Scenes'' on March 9, while a 12-hour free music marathon,
``Wall-to-Wall Weill,'' will be presented at Symphony Space on
March 25.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the scores of performances of Weill's music planned
for Europe and the United States in the coming months, there may be
few more poignant moments than seeing middle-class German audiences
giving ``The Eternal Road'' standing ovations at successive full
houses here this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to remember that East Germany was an atheist state,''
Moeller said, ``so many people don't know even the most familiar
Old Testament stories. `The Eternal Road' is a wonderful chance for
people in Chemnitz to learn the reality of a religion and its
roots. It has also made people sensitive to the need to build a new
synagogue, which after all means spending a lot of money on a very
small Jewish community. But I'm sure it will happen.''

REAL QUIET WINS HOLLYWOOD GOLD CUP WITH A LATE MOVE
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMONT, N.Y. _ Real Quiet, last year's 3-year-old champion and
winner of the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness, sneaked through on
the rail in the final 150 yards Sunday to snatch the $1 million
Hollywood Gold Cup by half a length over Budroyale.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Bailey, riding the winner of the Gold Cup for the fourth
time, nudged Real Quiet past Budroyale and Malek just before they
crossed the finish line in a tight race contested by only four
horses. It was only the second time in six races that Real Quiet
had won since last year's Preakness, but it was the 17th time in 20
races that he ran in the money, sending his career earnings past
$3.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little hairy for a while,'' Bailey said by telephone
from Hollywood Park in Los Angeles. ``I wasn't sure a spot would
open for me. I had the feeling that Kent Desormeaux on Puerto
Madero was trying to bottle me up the whole race. But patience paid
off. I had a lot of horse left and, when a hole did open, we shot
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey flew to California overnight after watching in the
Belmont Park paddock Saturday while his mount, Three Ring, reared
and fell in a fatal accident before the Mother Goose Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Baffert, who trains Real Quiet, praised Bailey for his
calmness under pressure, and said: ``He rides as though he's got
ice water in his veins. He waited, and a hole opened for him on the
rail in the final yards.''
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet, third behind Behrens in the Massachusetts Handicap
one month ago, ran the 1 1/4 miles in a fast 1:59 3/5 as the 4-5
favorite in the small field. The race turned out to be a downer for
Richard Mandella, the trainer of Malek and Puerto Madero, who
finished third and fourth.
</P>
<P>
   In the heat and humidity hanging over Belmont Park Sunday, the
sadness seemed even heavier in the barn area. But no information
was offered on the grim fate that struck down the star filly Three
Ring while she was being saddled for the Mother Goose Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not supposed to happen,'' said Eddie Plesa Jr., who
trained Three Ring for Barry Schwartz, chief executive officer for
Calvin Klein Industries and a trustee of the New York Racing
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Three Ring was being fitted for blinkers in her stall in the
outdoor paddock when she suddenly reared, fell and fractured her
skull against the post separating her from the filly in the next
stall. Dr. Anthony Verderosa reported that ``it was not something
that she could survive,'' and he administered an injection that
ended the life of the 3-year-old filly.
</P>
<P>
   Three Ring, who ran 19th and last in the Kentucky Derby last
month after her saddle slipped during a rough ride, won six races
in 10 starts and finished in the money nine times with earnings of
$773,440. She won the Acorn Stakes three weeks ago, and was aiming
for the Mother Goose, the middle race for fillies in the Triple
Tiara series.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she gets hurt in a race, that's what she's here for,''
Plesa said. ``But this is tough. It's like one of your loved ones
is crossing the street in front of you and gets hit by a car.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreams Gallore, who ran second to the leading filly
Silverbulletday in her last two races, won the Mother Goose by 7{
lengths. Her trainer, Steve Asmussen, said her next appearance
would be in the Coaching Club American Oaks on July 24, a $350,000
stake at 1 1/2 miles and the climactic race in the Triple Crown
series. The Oaks will also be the goal for Oh What a Windfall, who
finished second, but not for Better Than Honour, who ran third
after finishing second to Three Ring in the Acorn.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's run two hard races in a row, and maybe they took
something out of her,'' said John Kimmel, who trains Better Than
Honour. &QL;

SUPREME COURT DECISION LEAVES MANY INNOVATORS OUTRAGED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Fla.)  (mk) 
 By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week's Supreme Court decision granting states immunity from
patent infringement cast a pall over what might be called the
innovation community, summed up in the melancholy grumblings of a
Chicago patent lawyer, Peter Tryzna, who declared that Wednesday
was ``not a good day for innovators in America, but it's a great
day for thieves.''
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the decision, he had talked to clients and
colleagues, and like many other intellectual property lawyers and
analysts, inventors and academicians across the country, he was
alternately disgusted, angry and outraged.
</P>
<P>
   At the American Intellectual Property Law Association, Joseph
Re, the chairman of the association's Amicus Committee, said his
organization was ``extremely disappointed.'' The association had
filed a friend-of-the-court brief asking that the Supreme Court
consider patents as property protected by the 14th Amendment and
that states be required to waive their immunity if they are holders
of patents, trademarks or copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   ``States can participate in the intellectual property system,
make lots of money and royalties, file their own patents, license
their own patents, but they don't have to be accountable in
reverse,'' Re said. ``It's a shame that states can now freely
infringe without incurring any monetary liability.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week's ruling was one of three landmark decisions that
curbed Congress' ability to impose federal law on states, including
the statutes that grant exclusivity to holders of patents,
trademarks and copyrights. That gave the states, their universities
and agencies immunity to infringement suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means states can freely rip off citizens' patent,
trademark and copyright rights,'' Tryzna said. ``It will take a
constitutional amendment to fix this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   But before that happens _ if it ever does _ inventors and their
lawyers are already talking about alternatives to suing states that
they contend infringe, including taking legal action against
private companies that do business with those states.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they are speculating as to how far states and
their agencies might go to appropriate the writing, research or
properties of others. Musing over a worst-case scenario, Peter
Roberts, who owns the patent that was at the center of the Supreme
Court ruling, said: ``Imagine a corporation wants to do research.
That corporation could go to a state university, because the
university can pilfer someone else's intellectual property with
impunity, and the corporation could hide behind the university's
shield.''
</P>
<P>
   The court declared last week that states are immune from
lawsuits over a variety of violations of federal law, and its
decisions represented a dramatic realignment of authority between
states and the federal government. Explaining the 5-4 ruling
against making federal laws like patent statutes binding on states,
Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote: ``Congress has vast power but not
all power. Although the Constitution grants broad power to
Congress, our federalism requires that Congress treat the states in
a manner consistent with their status as residuary sovereigns and
joint participants of the governance of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the three cases originated with a 1994 lawsuit brought by
the College Savings Bank of Princeton, N.J., against the state of
Florida. Roberts is the bank's chairman. In 1988, Roberts won
patent No. 4,722,055 for a computerized prepaid college tuition
plan. His patented method involves selling certificates of deposit
to parents who want to save for their children's education. In the
last decade, an increasing number of financial instruments have
been patented, a practice that was upheld in July 1998 by the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, despite
criticism by some.
</P>
<P>
   Florida created the Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education
Expense Board and began offering a college savings plan of its own.
Roberts sued the state in 1994, contending the Florida plan
infringed on his patented method. In the intervening years, as the
case wound its way through the judicial system to the Supreme
Court, 16 more states adopted college savings plans that Roberts
contends infringe his patent. But as of last week, there seems
little left that he can do about it. When asked how he felt about
the Supreme Court ruling, Roberts was silent a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' he said finally, and then paused again. ``I think the
Supreme Court gave license to states to lower the Stars and Stripes
and raise the Jolly Roger. State piracy is going to spread like
wildfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just believe the Supreme Court has elevated political rights
over personal rights such as property rights, and that stands the
Constitution on its head,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said he thought any effort to craft a constitutional
amendment to allow patent infringement lawsuits against states was
``a pretty tall order.'' But there could be alternatives, he said.
A patent holder who feels he has been infringed might sue a state
under laws that govern the seizure of property, or via statutes
that allow one state to sue another, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a state sues another state, it goes into federal court and
immediately to the Supreme Court,'' Roberts said. ``If a patent
holder whose rights are violated can go and try to assign part of
the patent to some small state agency in another state, and then
sue the first state, the Supreme Court would have to act as a trial
court.''
</P>
<P>
   He also theorized that he could sue individual state officials,
and eventually ``enjoin them to stop them, but not recover any
money damages.''

BRAZILIANS TAKE TO THE WEB WITH UNCOMMON SPEED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Pierre Schuermann, one of Brazil's Internet
barons, did not know things would develop so fast.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Schuermann, 30, founded Zeek, a popular search
engine. Earlier this year, he sold Zeek to Star Media Network, a
company that was formed to seek out Internet opportunities in Latin
America, and became director of new business development in Brazil.
Then Star Media went public with a stock offering on Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speed of it all is amazing,'' Schuermann said in an
interview. ``I'm not sure when the 18-hour days are going to let
up.''
</P>
<P>
   They will probably continue for some time because Star Media is
facing competition from companies including Yahoo Inc., Microsoft,
America Online, Psinet and Telefonica SA _ that are jumping into
Brazil's portal war.
</P>
<P>
   The growing competition in Brazil among portals, the Web pages
people often use for information and links to other sites, may be a
preview of how large Internet companies will spread in other parts
of the non-English-speaking world.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is perhaps the most competitive portal market in the
world at this time,'' said Osvaldo Barbosa de Oliveira, the head of
Microsoft's online operations in Brazil. Oliveira cited the entry
this year of the three largest portals, America Online, Yahoo and
Microsoft, plus competition from companies that provide
local-language content.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, companies like Telefonica of Spain are entering the
battle, as well as the Globo organization, Brazil's largest media
group.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's MSN was the first large foreign portal to establish
operations in Brazil, reaching deals with 19 Brazilian content
providers. Yahoo quickly followed with its own Portuguese-language
portal, opening an office in Sao Paulo this month, while America
Online, whose partner in Latin America is the Cisneros Group of
Venezuela, is expected to start operations this week.
</P>
<P>
   Making Brazil a priority is easy to understand. With a single
currency, set of borders and regulatory framework for nearly 165
million people, this country is an easier target for expansion than
the many Spanish-speaking countries stretching from Mexico to
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil is another animal altogether because you get a huge
market with a common culture in one swoop,'' said Laura d'Oliveira,
the president of Sky3 in Hollywood, Fla., which specializes in
making corporate Web sites more profitable through online marketing
in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people using the Internet in Brazil grew 130
percent last year, making it Latin America's most wired nation,
accounting for half of the region's 6 million people on the Web,
according to International Data Corp. And despite a weak economy,
industry experts expect the number of Internet users in Brazil to
grow 60 percent to 100 percent over the next three years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Those users pay rates for Internet access that are comparable to
those in the United States. The top two providers charge about $20
and $12 a month, respectively, for unlimited access. Others charge
a fee for a certain amount of time and then more for each extra
hour. For instance, IBM Brazil charges $23 a month for 30 hours of
access and $1.50 for each additional hour.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the growth in Internet use has taken place through the
efforts and innovation of local companies like Universo Online,
Brazil's largest service provider and portal, with 400,000
subscribers. Universo Online, which is owned by two large media
concerns, Grupo Folha and Grupo Abril, is known for imaginative
strategies like using live online ads to sell cars two years ago,
when such practices were rare anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Although Caio Tulio Costa, the managing director of Universo
Online, declined to comment on speculation that the company had
been in takeover talks with a large portal company starting
operations in Brazil, he acknowledged that Universo Online was
close to selling a 10 percent stake to a new partner. And the
company has begun its own buying spree, with the purchase last week
of Miner Technology, a company in central Brazil that creates Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   While newcomers learn to compete with entrenched locals, the
portal war is taking place amid two bigger transformations. The
first is the invigoration of Brazil's telecommunications system, a
change that occurred after the nation's telephone monopoly was
privatized and opened to competition in 1998. That has increased
telephone and Internet access nationwide, something that is
expected to continue.
</P>
<P>
   The second is the consolidation among Internet service
providers, or ISPs, a trend underlined by the recent purchase of
two leading providers by Psinet of Herndon, Va., catapulting Psinet
into the ranks of the country's five largest service providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``By acquiring ISPs in Brazil, we're tapping into a market for
e-commerce that should grow by 75 to 100 percent over the next
couple of years,'' said Philippe Kuperman, head of Psinet's Latin
American activities. Though companies like Yahoo are largely in
search of advertising revenue, Psinet hopes to make money by
providing specific services to the corporate market.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar yet wider-reaching transaction, Telefonica bought a
controlling stake last week in Nutec, Brazil's second-largest
service provider and portal. Telefonica, already the biggest
telephone company in Brazil after gobbling up many parts of the
former state monopoly, bought Nutec to pursue its goal of being the
largest portal in the Portuguese- and Spanish-speaking world.
</P>
<P>
   Local news organizations speculated that Telefonica paid $500
million for Nutec, although people close to the transaction said
its value was considerably less.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is quite sure when, or how, the dust will settle as the
competition among portals gears up and Internet use continues to
climb.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the U.S. it's hard to find a friend who's not on the
Internet, while in Brazil I know many people who aren't
connected,'' said Gabriel Bitran, a Brazilian who is deputy dean at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan School of
Management and an expert on electronic commerce. ``I don't think
poverty should be that much of an obstacle as the price of PCs
falls.''

PETER ABELES, 75, A LEADER IN AUSTRALIA'S BUSINESS WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Peter Abeles, a Hungarian who fled to Australia after World War
II and as a transport executive became one of his adopted country's
most powerful business leaders, died on Sunday at his home in
Sydney. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was cancer, said the Australian Consul
General in New York, Michael E. Baume, who was also a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the Australian version of the American dream _ the
Australian dream,'' Baume said. ``He migrated and gained his
fortune through hard work, intelligence and opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Abeles, who was knighted in 1972, was the former managing
director of the global transportation company TNT Ltd., as well
known in some countries as Federal Express and United Parcel
Service are known in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   As joint chief executive with Rupert Murdoch, the multinational
media magnate, Abeles helped lead Ansett Transport Industries Ltd.,
one of the two main airlines in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Abeles was also a political powerbroker in Australia and a close
friend of former Prime Minister Bob Hawke. Indeed, Abeles witnessed
the highly publicized Kirribilli agreement between Hawke and Paul
Keating, who was then treasurer, in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement between the two Labor Party rivals concerned when
Hawke would step down as prime minister to make way for Keating.
</P>
<P>
   Hawke also backed Abeles' tough negotiating stance during a 1989
pilots' strike, which crippled Australia for six months.
</P>
<P>
   The former prime minister was one of the last close friends to
see Abeles on Thursday night. ``He was not conscious, but I was
able to put a kiss on his forehead,'' he told reporters in
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Born on April 25, 1924, in Vienna, Peter Emil Herbert Abeles
grew up and was educated in Budapest. He was a university student
in 1944 when the Germans invaded Hungary and sent him to a Nazi
work camp.
</P>
<P>
   He survived and, in 1949, with no money, he and his first wife,
Claire Dan, an actress and later an arts patron, arrived in
Australia, part of a large postwar exodus from Eastern Europe. The
marriage later ended in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Once in Australia, Abeles, described often as both charming and
ruthless, was a struggling salesman of textiles and used books.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1950s, he teamed up with another Hungarian, George
Rockey, and bought two trucks, with which they started a transport
company called Alltrans. In 1967, Alltrans merged with another
trucking company, Thomas Nationwide Transport, and became TNT Ltd.
The company grew rapidly, expanding into 180 countries by the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Abeles joined with Murdoch to take over Ansett
Transport Industries; TNT also took a 50 percent ownership. He
stayed at Ansett from 1980 to 1992 and resigned from TNT in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Abeles was a skilled bridge and poker player. One of his regular
poker partners was Robert Askin, the premier of New South Wales and
the official who recommended Abeles for knighthood.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his knighthood, Abeles became a companion in the General
Division of the Order of Australia in 1991. He was named Australian
of the Year in 1987 by The Australian, a national newspaper. He
served as a Reserve Bank board member and was chairman of the
Australian Cancer Research Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his second wife, Kitty; two daughters,
Michelle Johnston and Roberta Warren, and a stepdaughter, Yvonne
Mueller.

   NEW YORK _ Rose Kryzak, an outspoken lobbyist for the rights of
the elderly who was once credited with getting a utility charge
overturned as unfair to older people, died on Thursday at her home
in Queens. She was 99.
</P>
<P>
   She first came to the public's attention in 1976, when she
argued at a Federal Power Commission hearing in Washington that
utility companies should not be allowed to pass along to customers
_ many of whom were elderly people with restricted incomes _ the
cost of plants that were still under construction and not producing
power.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kryzak, then 75, bluntly challenged the lawyers and bankers
who represented the utilities. ``We cannot afford plants that most
of us would not live to enjoy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission decided not to allow such charges except in
hardship cases, and The New York Times attributed the decision to
the ``Kryzak problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kryzak's victory was not final. In 1987, after the name of
the agency had been changed to the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, the utilities won the right to request rate increases
that would cover up to 50 percent of the costs of plants under
construction.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kryzak also helped organize groups of the elderly
throughout New York state to lobby for a state-financed
pharmaceutical plan to assist in paying for prescription drugs,
worked to eliminate mandatory retirement laws and was vocal on
increasing state supplements for Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kryzak, a member of the American Communist Party throughout
her life, was one of the principal subjects interviewed for the
documentary ``Seeing Red,'' shown at the New York Film Festival in
1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``She held to her belief throughout her life,'' her son, Thomas,
said. ``She refused to accept that there was any problem with the
Soviet Union. Partly, it was patriotism for the old country. Both
she and my father, who died in 1985, were born in Russia before the
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   `'They considered themselves pioneers,'' he said, ``going down
the road that this country should go down.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kryzak, who was born on Oct. 15, 1899, was the oldest of
six children. Her family immigrated to the United States in 1910.
Her father, Isaac Marron, was an early member of the House Painters
Union and a Socialist.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kryzak worked her entire adult life for an actuary until
retiring in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her son, Thomas, of Queens, she is survived by a
daughter, Ann Herman of Lakeland, Fla., five grandchildren and a
great-granddaughter.

HUGH CARTER, 78, LEGISLATOR, FORMER PRESIDENT'S COUSIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hugh Alton Carter, a former Georgia state legislator and
businessman who had a central role in the early campaigns of
President Carter, his first cousin, and turned his store into a
center of Jimmy Carter lore, died Thursday at a hospital in
Americus, Ga. He was 78 and lived in nearby Plains.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from pneumonia and heart failure,
his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, a large-scale worm farmer and antiques dealer, succeeded
his cousin Jimmy in the state Senate and held on to the seat for 14
years until he stepped down in 1981, undefeated.
</P>
<P>
   Representing eight Georgia counties, he served as chairman of
the Senate Education Committee and was a senior member of the
Appropriations, Rules and Fiscal Affairs Committees.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from two-year Georgia Southwestern College and, in
1941, from the University of Georgia. As an Army lieutenant in
World War II, he saw combat in Europe, then remained in the
reserves and retired as a lieutenant colonel in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   After the war he opened a business, Hugh Carter's Worm Farm,
growing crickets and worms for fish bait. The company shipped bait
nationwide and advertised itself as the largest worm farm in the
world before he closed it three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Carter also turned the family's general merchandise store into
Hugh Carter's Antique Shop, a tourist mecca during the Carter
presidency. Along with Carter trinkets and memorabilia, he
dispensed local lore and political philosophy to visiting
reporters. He retired from the business in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As a state senator, Carter was active in his cousin's early
political campaigns. He raised some hackles in his immediate family
with the publication of his memoir, ``Cousin Beedie and Cousin
Hot'' (Prentice-Hall, 1978).
</P>
<P>
   It contained some unkind asides about the president's mother.
But overall it told of a warm and continuing relationship between
the cousins of the title, himself and Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   A key factor in Carter's life was his Baptist faith. He served
for many years in the Plains Baptist Church and, later, Maranatha
Baptist Church of Plains, as a song leader, church clerk and
deacon.
</P>
<P>
   Carter is survived by his wife of 57 years, Ruth Godwin Carter;
a son, Hugh Jr. of Atlanta; two daughters, Dr. Laurie Tharpe of
Macon, Ga., and Connie Collins of Byron, Ga.; a brother, Donnel, of
Sea Island, Ga., and seven grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   When Gov. Jimmy Carter became a serious presidential contender
in 1975, the Secret Service and the press corps discovered Plains,
a small farming community of a few hundred souls. The agents went
native, changing from knit suits into bib overalls.
</P>
<P>
   From his gift shop, cousin Hugh, unfooled, explained to members
of the press how he spotted G-men ``sauntering'' about town: their
``new and unbleached'' denims made them stick out like the
proverbial sore thumb.
</P>
<P>
   After Jimmy Carter lost his bid for re-election, Carter
condensed his analysis for the press to one word, ``Inflation.''

HIGH HOPES FOR AN OLD BOOK IN A NEW COVER  
 MTV NETWORKS, STAYING FOREVER YOUNG

<P>
   With the shelf life for most new books only months, can a
publisher correct a marketing mistake three years after publication
by reissuing a book with a new cover, a new title and an angle
linking it to a best seller?
</P>
<P>
   Walker &AMP; Co. is gambling that the technique will work for a book
it first published in 1996. The author, a professor named Morrie
Schwartz who died of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, known as Lou
Gehrig's disease, four months before publication, shared his
thoughts about dying and living. Walker's publisher, George Gibson,
marketed them under the title ``Letting Go'' as a death and
grieving book. It sold 6,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward to last week's hard-cover best-seller list. There,
with almost 1.9 million copies in print, is ``Tuesdays with
Morrie,'' published by Doubleday in 1997. Its author, Mitch Albom,
reminisces about learning life lessons from a dying professor:
Morrie Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
   In April, with the permission of Dell, Doubleday's sister
company in the publishing empire of Bertelsmann AG, which did a
modest paperback reprint of ``Letting Go,'' Walker reissued the
hard cover as ``Morrie: In His Own Words.'' There are now 30,000
copies in print.
</P>
<P>
   Although publishers often jump on best-selling bandwagons, the
ploy adopted by Walker is rare. Mitchell Kaplan, owner of Books &AMP;
Books in Miami Beach and Coral Gables, Fla., cautions that it would
be taken seriously only ``if we personally trust the publisher and
what he or she does.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Morrow, co-owner of Northshire Bookstore in Manchester
Center, Vt., has not seen sales spike. But a spokeswoman for the
Borders chain said its buyer liked the new cover, made an
aggressive purchase on the book and is pleased with sales.

   MTV Networks, Staying Forever Young
</P>
<P>
   Why are young people, heavy users of new media, watching more
television, one of the bastions of old media, as they surely are
these days on channels like MTV and Nickelodeon?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're putting more value into our brands,'' said Tom Freston,
the chairman of MTV Networks, which controls those two channels and
two others, VH-1 and TV Land. All four had ratings increases in the
second quarter of this year, most of all MTV itself, which jumped
36 percent from the comparable period last year.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers were even stronger for young viewers, MTV's natural
constituency. One measure of the channel's potency with this group:
Its MTV Movie Awards special on June 10 reached more viewers
between the ages of 12 and 24 than NBC, ABC and Fox combined that
night.
</P>
<P>
   The value that younger viewers seem to like is coming in new
programs like ``Total Request Live,'' a daily music show that is
regularly setting ratings records, and ``The Tom Green Show,'' an
offbeat comedy show whose host has so quickly become a figure in
the youth culture that he is already pitching to the newest Pepsi
generation in a series of quirky Pepsi-Cola commercials.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also coming in old shows like ``The Real World,'' the
series about real people trying to live together. Its season
premiere last week drew its highest rating ever _ and among viewers
between 12 and 34, it was the third-most-watched show on any
channel that night.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the event shows. When the Movie Awards show had
its highest rating ever, it continued a pattern for MTV Networks.
The ``Divas Live'' event for VH-1 hit its best rating ever this
year, as did the ``Kids Choice Awards'' on Nickelodeon. That
success contrasts with the ratings for the Oscars (down), Emmys
(down) and Grammys (down).
</P>
<P>
   ``We are reaching more people than ever,'' Freston said. ``Even
though we're competing with this horde of new cable channels as
well as the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy is not complicated. ``We're just spending more
money on marketing and programming,'' Freston said. That money is
increasingly available with advertisers eager to reach teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick is staying relevant and current,'' Freston said,
which is not especially easy to do when your channels are older
than most of your viewers. ``Really it's about staying cool,''
Freston said.

   Report on Television, Rebuttal on the Web
</P>
<P>
   The concept of letters to the editor has new meaning on the
Internet, where e-mail reactions can fly back and forth almost
instantly. Now CBS News has added another twist, posting a lengthy
list of objections from the subject of one of its investigative
reports on cbsnews.com, the news division's World Wide Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The aggrieved party, Charter Behavioral Health Systems, the
United States' largest chain of psychiatric hospitals, was the
subject of a ``60 Minutes II'' special report, by Ed Bradley, on
abuses of children in some of the hospitals. The report ran on
April 21 and was repeated on June 16, with CBS reporting that
Charter had closed the North Carolina hospital that was prominently
featured.
</P>
<P>
   But Charter, saying the report had several unfair or inaccurate
elements, sent CBS a videotaped statement from its chief medical
officer, Dr. Gary Henschen, and a lengthy document detailing those
elements and asking CBS to correct its statements on the air.
Instead, CBS News posted Charter's lengthy complaint on its Web
site, adding its own rebuttals to each Charter point
(www.cbs.com/flat/story161689.html).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very comprehensive response to their objections,'' said
David Gelber, the producer of the investigative report on Charter.
``We didn't feel any of their objections were valid. If we felt we
had made a mistake, we would have addressed it in the broadcast.''
</P>
<P>
   But Karen Jenkins, a spokeswoman for Charter, said the Web site
had not displayed all the documentation Charter had sent to CBS,
and she noted that the Web posting would not reach the great
majority of people who saw the broadcast on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least it allows the public to see there are two sides to
the story,'' she said. ``But we were disappointed that our response
did not get on as part of the broadcast.''
</P>
<P>
   In closing the June 16 program, Bradley told viewers about the
Charter response and described how to find the CBS News Web site
where they could read the accusations and rebuttals ``exactly as
they appear in our correspondence with Charter.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for abcnews.com and msnbc.com said neither of those
sites had been used for such exhaustive complaint and rebuttal. But
they said that they did get plenty of e-mail and that journalists
responded to most of it _ making letters to the editor interactive.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Brown, editor in chief of msnbc.com, said most
reporters' bylines were ``hot,'' meaning a reader can click on a
byline and send an e-mail message to that reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response rate, especially of aggrieved parties, is
incredibly fast,'' Brown said. ``We've had cases where we posted a
story at 7 p.m., and at 7:05 there's a response in my in-box.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The mere fact of having hot bylines keeps our feet to the fire
all the time,'' he said.

MARION MOTLEY, 79, FOOTBALL GREAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marion Motley, one of the National Football League's first black
players of the modern era and one of its best fullbacks ever, died
Sunday in Cleveland. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   Motley, a star with the Cleveland Browns from 1946 to 1953 and a
member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, had been suffering from
prostate cancer, according to Joe Horrigan, a spokesman for the
hall.
</P>
<P>
   Motley's first four years in pro football were the four seasons
that the All-America Football Conference existed. The Browns, with
a 47-4-3 record, won the league championship every year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, the NFL absorbed three AAFC teams _ the Browns, the San
Francisco 49ers and the Baltimore Colts _ and the AAFC went out of
business. Many football people felt that the Browns would be
outclassed in the established NFL, but in Motley's four years in
that league the Browns won their conference title every year and
the league championship in 1950, when Motley led the league in
rushing with 810 yards on 140 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Those Browns had such celebrated players as quarterback Otto
Graham, wide receivers Mac Speedie and Dante Lavelli, the offensive
tackle and kicker Lou Groza and offensive guard Bill Willis. None
contributed more than the 6-foot-1, 238-pound Motley, who was fast,
explosive and hard-working.
</P>
<P>
   In eight seasons with essentially a passing team, he rushed for
4,720 yards and 31 touchdowns. He was the AAFC's career rushing
leader with 3,024 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Motley was an inside blaster who had the speed to go outside. He
made most of his yardage on trap plays, on which a defensive
lineman was allowed to penetrate, then was trapped, allowing Motley
to run through the vacated area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trap was a fantastic play,'' he said, ``but I was seldom
sent outside. There's no telling how much yardage I might have made
if I ran as much as some backs do now.''
</P>
<P>
   Motley was also an exceptional pass blocker for Graham. The
quarterback called him ``the best fullback I ever saw, a better
all-around player than Jimmy Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   Blanton Collier, a Browns assistant coach then and later the
head coach, rated Motley ``the greatest all-around football player
I ever saw.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He had no equal as a blocker,'' Collier said. ``He could run
with anybody for 30 yards or so. And this man was a great, great
linebacker.''
</P>
<P>
   Motley was born on June 5, 1920, in Leesburg, Ga. He was raised
in Canton, Ohio, and played for McKinley High School. Paul Brown,
who would become the Cleveland Browns' founder and coach, first saw
him there when Brown was coaching Massillon High School, McKinley's
rival.
</P>
<P>
   Motley was an undistinguished college player for one year at
South Carolina State and three years at Nevada. After college, he
joined the Navy and played for the 1945 Great Lakes Naval Training
Station team, coached by Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad always felt Marion was the greatest back he ever had,''
Paul Brown's son, the Cincinnati Bengals' owner, Mike Brown, said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Browns signed Willis in 1946, there were only two
black players _ Kenny Washington and Woody Strode of the Los
Angeles Rams _ in the NFL and none in the AAFC. The Browns had
turned down Motley once, but now they wanted a black roommate for
Willis and gave the 26-year-old Motley a tryout. As Motley later
told the story:
</P>
<P>
   ``After a few practices, one of the white linemen, Mike Scarry,
told Paul Brown, `Either you get Motley for our side or I go over
to his side.' After that, I didn't worry about being Bill Willis'
roommate. I wanted to be the best fullback.''
</P>
<P>
   He became that, but he played his last four seasons with knee
trouble and quit just before the 1954 season. He attempted a
comeback in 1955 with the Pittsburgh Steelers, supposedly as a
linebacker. He played five of the first six games, mostly as a
blocking back for punts and field goals, but his knees were still
bad and the Steelers dropped him.
</P>
<P>
   His salary was $4,500 as a rookie and $15,000 in his last year
with the Browns.
</P>
<P>
   After his playing days, Motley wanted to coach in the NFL, but
black coaches were scarce. He coached a women's team in 1967 in
Cleveland and did occasional scouting for the Browns. He worked in
a post office and a parking lot and was a supervisor for the Ohio
lottery.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, he became the second black player (after Emlen Tunnell
of the New York Giants) to be voted into the Pro Football Hall,
which is in Canton. As his presenter, he chose Willis, his old
roommate.
</P>
<P>
   Motley said he was glad he played pro football.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fortunate,'' he said, ``to be able to be one of the few
to excel at something I liked to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by three sons, a brother and a sister.

NEW MIDSIZE CARS IN PURSUIT OF THE BABY BOOMER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The car company that grew up by pretending it did not
know its parent company, General Motors Corp., is starting a family
of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Saturn, the small-car brand that GM created a decade ago to win
back baby boomers from imports, will begin selling a midsize car in
July. About two years later, it plans to add a small sport utility
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Saturn initially achieved a near cultlike following, enabling GM
to turn its attention to Saturn's troubled siblings, including
Oldsmobile, Buick and Cadillac. But with only two aging models to
offer its 2 million customers, Saturn saw its sales slip to 231,522
last year from a high of 286,003 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Now, GM is embarking on a new strategy and a new ad campaign
starting on Monday promoting the Saturn brand and its midsize car.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about doubling the size of our company, and it is also
about moving into a segment that, let's face it, wasn't in our game
plan,'' said Jill Lajdziak, Saturn's vice president for sales,
service and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Auto-industry analysts and marketing experts are divided over
GM's approach: Some worry that extending the Saturn name beyond
small cars will cause an identity crisis, while others applaud the
move because it allows loyal Saturn owners to trade up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming out with a big Saturn is the same as coming out with a
cheap Cadillac,'' said Clive Chajet, a New York corporate-identity
consultant who maintains that small size and low price are
fundamental Saturn attributes. ``Saturn becomes just like
Oldsmobile _ it no longer stands for a precise something.''
</P>
<P>
   Others agree, saying that if Saturn offers a full line of cars,
it will become similar to GM's other divisions, many of which are
struggling. ``One of the problems is going to be how do you
differentiate this midsize Saturn from all the others out there,''
said Jack Trout, president of Trout &AMP; Partners, a
marketing-strategy firm in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the image right is more important for Saturn, perhaps,
than for any other auto brand because so much of Saturn's appeal
has come from the strong image that marketers created, rather than
the cars themselves. ``Ultimately, the product was mediocre; their
success was more built off the image they built up,'' said Wesley
Brown, an auto consultant at Nextrend, in Thousand Oaks, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown thinks that adding a midsize car is a good move.
``That division has been for a long time begging to be able to
expand their lineup,'' he said. ``They've needed more product for
years.''
</P>
<P>
   GM executives are counting on the car's being a hit. ``We expect
great things to happen with that new car,'' Roy Roberts, vice
president for North American sales, service and marketing, said
early this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The midsize car is called simply LS for larger Saturn. Its
primary target market consists of married, college-educated
customers between 35 and 49, with one or two children and a
household income of $55,000 or so. About 55 percent of buyers are
expected to be men. The car, which starts at $15,450, is intended
to compete with low-end models of the Toyota Camry and the Honda
Accord.
</P>
<P>
   Television teaser ads start on Monday night on the Fox Network's
popular ``Ally McBeal'' program and run on various prime-time and
cable programs through July. The ads, all by Saturn's longtime
agency, Publicis &AMP; Hal Riney, will also be shown on Saturn's World
Wide Web site (www.saturn.com). Others will appear in magazines, on
the sides of buildings, and on bus shelters and other outdoor
spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Saturn spent $210 million last year on advertising, according to
Competitive Media Reporting. Lisa Hutchinson, Saturn's director of
marketing, declined to say how much Saturn will spend on the new ad
campaign, except that it would be ``significantly higher than it
was last year.'' The ad campaign is important because ``we're not
just introducing a new car line; we're relaunching the Saturn
brand,'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One teaser ad simply shows five pairs of blue jeans being put
out on a clothesline to dry. Each is a different size, and the logo
``S-M-LS-XL'' appears, along with the tag line ``Coming Soon. The
next big thing from Saturn.'' Another shows children of varying
sizes jumping into a pool and swimming underwater, followed by
their father. None of the teaser ads show the car.
</P>
<P>
   The car is first scheduled to be shown in a 90-second television
ad beginning early in August. The ad uses Danny Glover's voice to
retell the Saturn story in sweeping, emotionally charged
statements. ``One day a factory went up and people's spirits went
up with it,'' Glover says as images of happy workers in the rural
setting of Saturn's factory in Spring Hill, Tenn., appear. He talks
of the road to creating a new car company against the odds.
</P>
<P>
   Glover cites the company's success, and then says ``they
realized there was more road, so they set out on it again and it
led them here to the new larger Saturn LS.'' Then the ad shows the
car and uses the tag line ``the next big thing from Saturn.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most striking ads will be three billboards _ one on
Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, one on Interstate 80 near the Bay
Bridge around San Francisco and one on the Virgin Megastore in
Times Square in New York _ which will replace teaser ads in those
locations on Aug. 2. A Saturn LS will be mounted on each billboard
(after having been hollowed out to lighten the load), with
headlights that click on at dusk and windshield wipers that turn on
when it rains.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas J. Else, the Saturn account director at Publicis &AMP; Hal
Riney, said, ``The biggest challenge we have is to convey to people
that Saturn has a new larger car, not a replacement car.'' In the
past, he added, ``We just had one car and we had to be appealing to
everybody.''

FRANKFURT BEATS BARCELONA, 38-24, IN WORLD BOWL FOOTBALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALAN MAIMON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUESSELDORF, Germany _ The Frankfurt Galaxy defeated the
Barcelona Dragons to capture World Bowl '99 Sunday by 38-24, ending
the NFL Europe season while setting the stage for Lawrence
Phillips' return to the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Andy McCullough, allocated to the NFL Europe by
the Arizona Cardinals, led the offensive onslaught with three
touchdown catches and was named the game's most valuable player as
Frankfurt avenged two regular-season losses to Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
   But after the game, played before 39,643 at Rhein Stadium, all
eyes were on the Barcelona locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, the often troubled running back who was given a chance
to turn his career around with Barcelona, became the first player
in the seven-year history of the NFL Europe to rush for more than
1,000 yards in a season.
</P>
<P>
   A pulled hamstring Sunday in the second quarter sidelined
Phillips for the entire second half. He finished the game with 40
yards on seven rushes and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more significant, Phillips has shown NFL teams he can
stay out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The problems that plagued Phillips at the University of Nebraska
and in the professional ranks after he was drafted sixth overall by
the St. Louis Rams in 1996 did not surface during his stint in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The Barcelona coach, Jack Bicknell, believed in giving Phillips
a chance to prove he had learned from mistakes. Phillips had not
played for 18 months before joining Barcelona as a 10th-round pick
in the NFL Europe draft.
</P>
<P>
   He earned only $15,000 playing for the Dragons, a far cry from
the $5.6 million over three years he would have made with the Rams.
Phillips was arrested three times and spent 23 days in jail during
his 19 months with the Rams, who eventually released him.
</P>
<P>
   Bicknell is gratified that Phillips rewarded his trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lawrence has shown me a lot this season,'' Bicknell said. ``He
came to play in Europe voluntarily and ended up benefiting so much
from this experience. I can't wait to see him in the NFL''
</P>
<P>
   Several NFL teams have contacted Phillips' agent, and the
Raiders and Packers are believed to have the inside track. Green
Bay general manager Ron Wolf said that he would do everything in
his power to sign Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf and other general managers can start lining up to talk to
Phillips this week. The running back has trimmed down to 210 pounds
and believes his time in Barcelona was exactly what he needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely a better player than I was in St. Louis and
Miami,'' Phillips said before the game. ``I played well this season
and I had fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The presence of a high-visibility player like Phillips along
with several strong NFL prospects helped the European league find
secure footing this season. Last season, 139 players with league
experience played in the NFL. The number is expected to rise next
season.
</P>
<P>
   One player who can enter training camp brimming with optimism is
McCullough. Frankfurt coach Dick Curl used his usual quarterback
platoon of Pat Barnes and Jake Delhomme. Both quarterbacks were
able to find McCullough free for big receptions.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year, McCullough hopes to be catching passes in
Tempe, Ariz., from another Jake _ Cardinal quarterback Jake
Plummer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what I have to do to make the Cardinals,'' McCullough
said after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips is guaranteed another shot at an NFL career. McCullough
can go to camp flaunting impressive numbers from the NFL Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of players in the NFL Europe, however, have
less-certain futures. Scott Dragos, a Barcelona tight end allocated
by the Giants, heads to training camp in Albany, N.Y., knowing he
faces a hard battle.
</P>
<P>
   But like many NFL Europe players, he hopes for the best and
talks positively about the time he spent playing in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it this way,'' Dragos said before Sunday's game. ``I
played good football in Europe and had a chance to brush up on my
college Spanish at the same time. Now I have to go to camp and give
it my best shot.''

 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Firefighter Tom Ryan walked soberly down Fifth Avenue
on Sunday, the fire commissioner at his side, the mayor a few feet
ahead, and a gyrating, feather-bedecked moving carnival of gay
Brazilians behind.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in the 30-year history of the Gay and Lesbian
Pride March, an active-duty firefighter in blue dress uniform was
marching in the parade, and the Fire Department, known for its
heavily male, tradition-bound culture, was recognizing Fireflag, a
gay firefighters' group, as an official ``line organization'' in
the parade.
</P>
<P>
   The image of a uniformed firefighter amid thousands of gay men,
lesbians, bisexuals, transvestites and transsexuals, some clad in
shorts and T-shirts, others in heels and leather thong underwear,
spoke volumes about the diversity of the gay rights movement 30
years after a police raid sparked an uprising at the Stonewall Inn
in Greenwich Village and made the Stonewall a powerful symbol of
resistance.
</P>
<P>
   It also illuminated the uneasy bond that the movement and the
establishment, once completely at odds, have formed. Twenty-nine
years ago, there was a demonstration at City Hall against allowing
homosexuals in the Fire Department _ an incident that contrasts
sharply with ``the fire commissioner and the mayor of the city
proudly marching down the avenue,'' Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was repeatedly heckled along the
parade route, particularly by a contingent of minority marchers who
were angry that he was marching close to them. The police said
three people were arrested, two on charges of disorderly conduct
and one on charges of petty larceny.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should be able to march as the mayor of New York City
anyplace you want,'' Giuliani said after he made his planned exit
from the parade route, ``and if people can't deal with their own
anger over that, that's really something emerging from them, from
inside them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Riordan, a spokesman for Heritage of Pride, which
organizes the parade, was unapologetic. ``Nobody is barred from
being in the parade,'' he said. ``It's completely open to all
people. He's just not popular.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other tensions. Members of a group called SexPanic!
said that near the end of the parade route, at Seventh Avenue South
and Christopher Street, the police told them to pull the group's
car, an old police car holding the self-styled ``Rudy's sex
police,'' out of the parade or face arrest because it was
``inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The police said the marchers' attire, or lack thereof, was the
problem. ``They were asked to leave the route because they were
naked, from the waist down,'' said Lt. Cory Cuneo, a police
spokesman. ``It didn't have anything to do with the police car or
anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   And soon after the parade began, a clutch of protesters, kept
safely behind a barricade, shouted at the marchers. Randall Terry,
the founder of Operation Rescue, an anti-abortion group, and of an
anti-gay group called the Resistance, said, ``We cannot pretend
this is a normal lifestyle. It is an abhorrent abomination.'' He
called Stonewall an ``anniversary of disgrace'' and said: ``Our
goal is to mobilize resistance to these people at every level. They
cannot prevail, because there is a God in heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   But by the thousands _ 700,000 according to parade organizers,
or 100,000 according to the police _ participants marched joyously.
Among them were about 50 police officers who are members of the Gay
Officers Action League.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Officer Anna Marie Buckley marched next to her longtime partner,
Detective Marianne Murawski, and pushed a double stroller with
their two daughters. Each woman had one child by artificial
insemination from the same anonymous donor, Officer Buckley said.
</P>
<P>
   The contingent of police officers in the Pride March grows each
year, Officer Buckley said. ``More and more people are realizing
that the best place to be is out of the closet,'' she said.
``People criticize you less, they ridicule you less.''
</P>
<P>
   Officer Buckley said the attitude of the Police Department
toward gay men and lesbians had improved considerably since she
joined the department eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And Thomas Von Essen, the fire commissioner, said he was
determined to bring his department along the same route.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our department is a very male-dominated group of people, and
it's important for them to be rough and tough,'' he said. That
makes them brave, he said, but not always accepting of those who
are different.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 1999,'' he continued. ``These firefighters have proven
they are just as competent, just as determined to do as good a job,
and they deserve the respect of everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, the only firefighter among 8,800 in New York City who has
publicly declared that he is gay, said he had a ``very, very''
difficult time after he came out a year ago, and some friends in
the department turned their backs on him. But he is undeterred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping to show young people struggling in their sexuality
that they can grow up to be a fireman or a cop,'' Ryan said, ``that
they can have the same hopes and dreams as any other little kid.''
</P>
<P>
   The parade was a tapestry of stories and a tableau of images.
Members of one leather-clad group stopped periodically along the
route for demonstrations of sadism and masochism, whipping one
another. The police officers lining the route watched them
stoically, as they did the women who marched topless.
</P>
<P>
   The sounds of the parade _ a variety of music, including salsa
and reggae _ told another story, that of the growing number of
immigrants for whom coming out is an American rite of passage.
Among them was Bassam Kassab, 30, a graduate student in Boston who
is from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   When his mother, Aida, arrived for a visit from Lebanon two
weeks ago, she did not know that he was gay, he said. But on
Friday, as he drove to New York, he narrowly avoided a serious
accident. He pulled into a rest stop and called his mother, who was
still in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ```I almost died,''' he said he told her, ```and there's
something I haven't told you for 15 years: I'm gay.'''
</P>
<P>
   Her response, he said, was immediate: ```You should have told me
a long time ago, because that's how you are born, I would have
supported you, and you wouldn't have lived in misery for 15
years.'''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, members of Karama, the New England Lavender Arab
Society, pulled her along the parade route in a cart on which had
been pasted a hand-lettered sign: ``Proud Lebanese Gay's Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Benov, 67, was another proud mother marching, if a bereft
one. Two of her four sons were gay; both died in 1990 of
complications from AIDS. ``We have to be here for them, for their
memories,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On Stonewall's 30th anniversary, she contemplated life before
Stonewall, when gay men could be arrested based on how they walked
or dressed or sought companionship.
</P>
<P>
   ``How grateful I am that my sons didn't have to go through
that,'' she said.

REAL QUIET SQUEEZES BY IN GOLD CUP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ In a pleasant surprise after a week of
hand-wringing over the tiny, all-local field, the 60th Hollywood
Gold Cup lived up to its name, and its winner's.
</P>
<P>
   Real quietly, Sunday's $1 million race turned into a highly
tactical and hard-fought thriller in which each of the four horses
looked like the winner at some point in the 1\ miles.
</P>
<P>
   Stride by stride, the tension built around the predicament of
Kentucky Derby winner Real Quiet and Hall of Fame jockey Jerry
Bailey, who found themselves boxed behind dueling front-runners
Malek and Budroyale and inside Puerto Madero.
</P>
<P>
   Not until the horses were in mid-stretch, urged on by the rising
voices of 27,562 fans, was Bailey able to cut between the tiring
leaders and the rail and send Real Quiet to a desperate,
half-length victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt, you can get in big trouble in a small
field,'' Bailey said after proving exactly that to the temporary
dismay of bettors who made Real Quiet an odds-on favorite (he paid
$3.80).
</P>
<P>
   Long shot Budroyale and Garrett Gomez held on for second by a
neck, putting the long-time claiming horse over $1 million in
career earnings. Malek and Alex Solis finished third, last year's
Santa Anita Handicap winner feeling the effects of a 61-day layoff.
</P>
<P>
   A distant last were Puerto Madero and Kent Desormeaux, who
threatened the leaders fleetingly as they turned for home _ after
spending the first half of the race trying to frustrate Real Quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet owner Mike Pegram and trainer Bob Baffert watched the
drama unfold from the box seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the eighth (of a mile) pole, I was not a happy camper,''
Pegram said, remembering the moment before Bailey found daylight.
``I was saying, `What are you doing, Jerry?!'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good thing he wasn't miked (for television),'' Baffert said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then,'' Pegram said, ``I found out why he (Bailey) is the best
in the East, and I was happy we got him out here.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey picked up the mount after Gary Stevens _ who'd ridden
Real Quiet in his Pimlico Special victory and two other races this
year _ went to ride in his wife's native England earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Climbing aboard the colt for the first time, Bailey made Real
Quiet his fourth Gold Cup winner of the 1990s, following Sultry
Song ('92), Cigar ('96) and Skip Away ('98). The first three
victories looked easy compared to this one.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey and Baffert said they'd anticipated that Desormeaux,
starting from the outside post, would try to hem in the favorite,
starting from post 2. But when it happened, there wasn't much
Bailey could do about it. The leaders set a slow pace for a race
clocked in 1:59 3/5, and the small pack stayed tight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have had to take take him out the back door (and try
to loop the field),'' Bailey said. ``Desormeaux looked over at me
several times and he was going to play to what I did. If I started
taking back to get outside, he was going to ease back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really thought he'd run out of horse by the top of the
stretch and let me out.''
</P>
<P>
   Desormeaux did run out of horse. Just not soon enough for
Bailey. In the stretch he was caught behind a wall of rivals,
forced to keep Real Quiet in neutral.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left myself with three options,'' Bailey said. ``One out,
one in, one in between if the horses split (in front of) me. I
think I prepared myself well, but you always have to have some luck
and a good horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually you're going to get through somewhere. The question is
how deep in the stretch it's going to be and how quick the horse is
going to respond.... It's asking a lot of a big, long-striding
horse to gather himself and make up two lengths on horses that are
trying themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry rides like he has ice water in his veins,'' Baffert
said. ``I would have panicked at the quarter pole.''
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet was the first Gold Cup starter for Baffert, who
nearly won the Triple Crown with Silver Charm in '97 and Real Quiet
in '98. Real Quiet became the first Kentucky Derby winner to win
the Gold Cup since Ferdinand in '87.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sunday, the 4-year-old had won once in five starts since
the Preakness. He needed this victory to make him a force in the
national handicap division. With the 20 points he earned, he
vaulted to second in the ``NTRA Champions on Fox'' standings and
trails Behrens 28-22 with four events left in the 11-race series.
</P>
<P>
   Behrens' absence, and favorite Old Trieste's withdrawal five
days before the race with a foot abscess and illness, left the Gold
Cup with the fewest horses in its glorious history. There didn't
seem to be much intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   Then the starting gate opened.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans,'' Baffert said, ``they got their money's worth.''

ADVERTISING: ACCOUNT REVIEW MOVES TO CYBERREALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Mass., Calif., Ohio, N.J.)  (lb) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A French company is bringing an Internet service to the United
States intended to assist in conducting account reviews online,
helping agencies hook up with advertisers and consultants seeking
shops.
</P>
<P>
   Maydream SA is introducing a Web site named Agency Preview
(www.adforum.com), a database that will include information about
subscribing agencies like credentials, client rosters, billings,
specialty services and awards. The site will also offer samples of
creative work that can include television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies have already been capitalizing on the benefits
of interactivity for agency reviews by offering Web sites,
including Business Partnering International in Richmond, Va.
(www.agencyfinder.com) and Pile &AMP; Co. in Boston
(www.agencycompile.com). The role cyberspace is beginning to play
in how agency searches are conducted is indicative of the ways the
Internet is changing the way the advertising industry operates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're finally bringing the agency search process in line with
the new technology,'' said Neil Kreisberg, executive vice president
and group director at Grey Advertising in New York, one of more
than 30 American and European agencies taking part in the start-up
of Agency Preview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the technological revolution in most of what we're
doing,'' he added, ``the way the process is being run now is pretty
archaic.''
</P>
<P>
   Other examples of the transformative nature of the Internet for
Madison Avenue include Web sites like www.adsgallery.com and
www.portfolios.com from Warp 10 Technologies Inc. in San Francisco,
which are meant to offer online showcases for the work of agencies,
graphic and Web designers, copywriters, photographers and other
creative talent, and online services for buying and selling
advertising space and commercial time like Adauction.com in San
Francisco and Adoutlet.com in Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   One agency, Mann Bukvic Gatch Partners in Cincinnati, has even
put up a Web site (www.yourpitch.com) to compete for an account
placed in review by Screaming Media, a new media company in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advertising world is becoming more and more reliant on
global information,'' said Herve C. de Clerck, the founder and
president of Maydream, who goes by the fanciful title of dream
leader. ``Our goal is to connect advertisers, consultants and
agencies in an efficient manner, so that their new-business efforts
can be maximized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advertisers don't want to waste time talking to agencies that
aren't right for them,'' he added, ``and agencies don't want to
waste time chasing business they will ultimately not win. And
consultants want to identify agencies they might have initially
overlooked _ or that might have conflicts.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 13 consultants, which help manage reviews,
participating in Agency Preview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe it's a plus,'' said Leslie Winthrop, managing
director at AAR/Bob Wolf Partners in New York, a consultant that is
part of the worldwide AAR consulting network.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have more information that's more easily accessible is more
cost efficient for the client,'' she added. ``And we can spend more
time with the agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Consultants will pay $9,500 a year to have full access to the
Web site. Agencies will pay $2,000 a year to subscribe; in addition
to the data they can put up, they can also provide hot links to
their own Web sites, list e-mail contact information and offer
animated presentations.
</P>
<P>
   To oversee Agency Preview, Maydream, which is based in Boulogne,
France, has opened an American unit, Maydream Inc., in Hoboken,
N.J., where Rob Drasin is vice president for United States
marketing and sales.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's something you don't read every day, ``Hoboken'' and
``France'' in the same sentence.
