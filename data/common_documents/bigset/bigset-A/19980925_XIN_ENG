MOSCOW -- Russia Thursday welcomed the United Nations Security
Council resolution on the issue of Kosovo, Yugoslavia, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said in a news release that "there is no
reasonable alternative to a peaceful settlement in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolution adopted Wednesday calls for a negotiated
settlement of the conflict between official Serb forces and ethnic
Albanians in the southern Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
While calling for Kosovo to stay within the Yugoslav
federation, it demands extensive autonomy for the province.
</P>
<P>
The Russian ministry said the U.N. resolution introduced no new
sanctions against Yugoslavia, and gave no green light for the use
of force demanded by some members of the U.N. Security Council.

BRUSSELS -- NATO issued on Thursday an activation warning for a
limited air strike and a phased air campaign in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The warning allows NATO to enter into a state of increased
level of military preparedness and to identify the assets required
for the planned military actions, said NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana in issuing the warning.
</P>
<P>
Solana said: "The use of force will require further decision
by the North Atlantic Council.
</P>
<P>
"But the decision is an important political signal of NATO's
readiness to use force if it becomes necessary to do so."
</P>
<P>
He also expressed strong support of the U.N. Security Council
resolution adopted on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
NATO has been studying various options of the use of force in
the Yugoslav province of Kosovo ever since NATO foreign ministers
met in late April. (NATO-Kosovo-Warning)

ISLAMABAD -- Iran will keep its troops at its eastern border
with Afghanistan, "as long as it feels insecure," Iranian
Ambassador to Pakistan Mehdi Akhundazdeh said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters at a press conference, "Our troops would
remain there to safeguard our national integrity against growing
cross-border drug trafficking, but their posture will remain
defensive."
</P>
<P>
He said some 400 Iranian security troops, including a senior
commander, have been killed in clashes with drug traffickers at
the Iran-Afghan border over the past year.

<HEADLINE> Avis Europe Aims for Asian Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Avis Europe, the European car
rental group, is seeking to expand its presence in Asian markets
over the next year despite the region's serious economic troubles.
</P>
<P>
Alun Cathcart, chairman of Avis Europe, was quoted by
Thursday's Financial Times as saying, "We are currently
unrepresented in Japan, China and India and it is my main
preoccupation that we should get a foothold in those markets."
</P>
<P>
Cathcart noted that Avis would seek licensees in South Korea
and India as a way of entering those markets, but could
conceivably take an equity stake in a Japanese operation.
</P>
<P>
Announcing its interim results Wednesday, Avis Europe said its
existing Asian operations, all of which are through licensees,
generated income of 800,000 pounds (about 1.3 million U.S.
dollars), down 12 percent on the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the group's interests in Asia, Avis Europe, which is
well-managed and deserves its market rating, made it clear that
even if Europe's economic recovery were snuffed out, it could
still adjust fleet capacity quickly to cope.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Holds Ministerial Meeting on Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Thursday convened the second ministerial Meeting on
Africa to gather more international efforts to bring peace,
stability and development to the conflict-torn Africa.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from the 15 Security Council member states,
including Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan, were present at
the meeting, which was held on the sidelines of the 53rd General
Assembly session.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said
that the Security Council has showed its commitment to lasting
peace in Africa by setting up active working groups and adopting
very important resolutions on recommendations of a report
submitted by Annan in April, and by authorizing two new
peacekeeping operations -- in the Central African Republic and in
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The report, also to be considered by the General Assembly in
October, emphasized that any and all efforts at securing peace
have to be combined with steps towards ending Africa's poverty.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the report, seen as one of the most important
reports by Annan since he came to office last year, called for the
promotion of investment and economic growth, ensuring of adequate
levels of international aid, reduction of debt burdens and opening
of international markets to Africa's products.
</P>
<P>
In the speech, Annan called upon the international community to
encourage investments in Africa, to consider converting all
remaining official bilateral debt owed by the poorest African
countries into grants, to increase the volume and improve the
quality of official assistance to Africa, and to ease access
conditions for African exports.
</P>
<P>
Africa "has largely been marginalized in the process of
globalization," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial meeting was held at a time when gun shots had
been fired between Ethiopia and Eriteria, in the Great Lakes
region and West Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations, in partnership with the OAU (Organization
of African Unity) is actively involved in seeking an end to every
one of these crises and to alleviate the suffering borne by
innocent people," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"But in a large sense, we can only appeal to the wisdom and the
responsibility of leaders to put the interests of their people
over their own," he added.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial meeting on Africa is expected to adopt a
presidential statement, which will reaffirm the Security Council's
commitment to Africa in the areas of conflict prevention and the
maintenance of international peace and security.

<HEADLINE> New 20-Dollar Bill Enters Circulation in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- A redesigned 20-dollar
bill, believed to be harder to counterfeit, entered Thursday into
nationwide circulation in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve's 12 regional banks have begun shipping two
billion new notes, totaling 40 billion dollars, to the nation's
banks, savings institutions and credit unions.
</P>
<P>
The old 20-dollar note will remain legal tender, said Treasury
Department officials at a ceremony. And the Fed will circulate
the old notes until they wear out, on average in two years.
</P>
<P>
After six months, one in every four 20-dollar bills in
circulation are expected to be of the new design, which
incorporates a range of features intended to frustrate
counterfeiters armed with personal computers, scanners, ink-jet
printers and color copiers.
</P>
<P>
The new note is the third of the Series 1996 to be redesigned
with new anti-counterfeiting features.
</P>
<P>
The most obvious change is the larger and off-center portrait
of Andrew Jackson, the nation's seventh president, on the bill's
face. The reverse features a picture of the north side of the
White House, instead of the south side seen on the old notes. To
help people with poor vision, the bill's denomination appears in
large dark numerals on a light background.
</P>
<P>
The government issued new 100-dollar notes, with Benjamin
Franklin, in March 1996, and new 50-dollar bills, with Ulysses S.
Grant, in October 1997. It plans to issue new 10-dollar bills and
5-dollar bills simultaneously in 2000 and a more modestly
redesigned one dollar bill after that.
</P>
<P>
The newly-circulated bills have a watermark in the shape of a
portrait, visible when the bills are held to a light, and an
embedded plastic security thread that glows under ultraviolet
light, red for the 100-dollar bills, yellow for the 50-dollar
bills and green for the 20-dollar bills.
</P>
<P>
The numeral in the lower right corner of each denomination's
face is printed in color-shifting ink. It looks green when viewed
straight on and black when viewed from an angle.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Foreign Minister on Peace, Stability in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Peace and stability in
Africa are part and parcel of peace, stability and development in
the world, Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Security Council's second ministerial meeting on
Africa, Tang said that "without development of Africa, there will
be no prosperity of the world."
</P>
<P>
"Members of the international community, developed countries in
particular, have an obligation to promote stability in Africa, and
more importantly, to help African countries to shake off poverty
and develop their economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Given the great number of its countries, Africa is an
important political force in international affairs that cannot be
neglected," he said. "Africa is a promising continent with great
potential in international economic development."
</P>
<P>
African countries make up some one-third of the total 185
member states of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
On recent frequent conflicts in Africa, Tang said, "It is our
sincere hope that the relevant African countries will, in the
spirit of national reconciliation, take into consideration the
fundamental and long-term interests of their states and people,
and properly settle their disputes through negotiations on the
basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence."
</P>
<P>
Tang also called on African countries to "avoid conflicts, iron
out their differences and join hands in a concerted effort to
contribute to peace and stability in Africa."
</P>
<P>
"We are of the view that the Security Council has an
inescapable obligation to maintain peace and stability in Africa,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. should strengthen its coordination with the OAU
(Organization of African Unity) in resolving the conflicts in
Africa, earnestly consider the reasonable propositions and demands
of the African countries, and support their efforts in maintaining
the regional peace and security and defending their state
sovereignty and territorial integrity," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As one of the permanent members of the Security Council, China
has all along attached importance to peace and development in
Africa," he said.
</P>
<P>
"China has always stood by the African countries in their
legitimate demands and reasonable propositions, and supported
their endeavors to maintain political stability and promote
economic growth and their useful efforts aimed at enhancing
African unity and regional cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"China will as always strengthen its friendly relations and
cooperation with the African countries and make further
contributions to the promotion of peace, stability and development
in Africa," he added.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from countries including Brazil, France, the
United Kingdom and the United States also took the floor to air
their views on Africa at the ministerial meeting, held on the
sidelines of the 53rd General Assembly session.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council held the first ministerial meeting on
Africa in September last year.

<HEADLINE> Zhang Wannian Stresses Sino-Japanese Ties in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Japan should look at history in
a right perspective and handle the Taiwan issue properly, Zhang
Wannian, Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission of
China, told Japanese defense officials Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Director-General of Japan's Defense Agency
Fukushiro Nukaga, Zhang said Sino-Japanese relations are generally
good despite the ups and downs since the two countries normalized
their diplomatic ties 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
On the proposed new guidelines for Japan-U.S. defense
cooperation, he said it would help ease China's concerns over the
Japan-U.S. program if Japan could clarify that the scope of the
new guidelines did not cover China's Taiwan province.
</P>
<P>
Zhang reiterated that carrying the Sino-Japanese friendship
from generation to generation is not only in the fundamental
interests of the two peoples, but also conducive to the peace and
stability of the Asia-Pacific region and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
Nukaga welcomed Zhang's visit to Japan and agreed that
maintaining a sound Japan-China relationship is very important.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese defense chief hoped that personnel exchanges
between the two countries' armed forces should be further
enhanced.

ADDIS ABABA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia announced
Thursday that a total of 24,970 Ethiopians have been expelled
from Eritrea since the border dispute between the two countries
erupted in early May, this year.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made after some 4,000 Ethiopians were
repatriated from Eritrea recently.
</P>
<P>
The Office of Government Spokeswoman Selome Taddesse quoted
the figures released by the local Disaster Prevention and
Preparedness Commission as saying that those people were
expelled through the border at Zalambessa, Adwa, Bure and
Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
The office said in a press release, "Until now there has been
only one reception center near the Bure border at Logiya where
4,000 people have already sought refuge. Yesterday a new center
was opened at Mile and 1,000 people arrived straight away.
Another 500 are expected to arrive there today."

<HEADLINE> Scottish Lockerbie Lawyer Raps Libyan Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- A Scottish lawyer acting for
two Libyan suspects accused of undertaking the 1988 Lockerbie
bombing Thursday launched verbal attacks upon Libya's decision to
name a new defense team.
</P>
<P>
Alister Duff was quoted by Reuters as saying Thursday that he
had been shocked by the Libyan decision to appoint former Libyan
Foreign Affairs Minister Kamal Maghour to lead the defense team
and expressed concern over this action.
</P>
<P>
"I am very concerned about this. It can be argued that the
Libyan establishment has interests which conflict with those of
the accused. We have to be very concerned about Libya's motives,"
Duff said.
</P>
<P>
"The accused might find the advice they are given by the new
team is colored by the Libyan authorities' views. I didn't expect
this at all. It's ghastly, to be frank," he said.
</P>
<P>
This latest development of the Lockerbie case could cast
further doubts on whether the two suspects could be put on trial
in The Hague, the Netherlands, before a Scottish court.
</P>
<P>
Some 270 people were killed when a Pan AM flight 103 exploded
over the Scottish town of Lockerbie in December 1988. The British
and American governments have been locked in heated arguments with
Libyans on how to stage a trial for the two Libyan suspects.

<HEADLINE> Hosts Dominates Opening Day at China Cup Gymnastics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese gymnasts took no
sweat to sweep all four titles on offer in the first day of the
China Cup International Gymnastics Tournament here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Both team and all-round individual titles easily went to C
hina, who sent three teams to compete in the tournament which
could hardly claim to be a showcase of the world's best with no
Russians present and other participating countries and regions
apparently fielding none of their first-string line-ups.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese men's team A, led by Good Will Games champion
Huang Xu, captured the team gold with 172.55 points, with
hosts'team B following up with 169.50 and Belarus the third with
165.30.
</P>
<P>
The women's team events were aslo dominated by the host
gymnasts, while their team A scoring 114.512 points to lead a
1-2-3 finish for the host nation.
</P>
<P>
All-round competition seemed to be a domestic battle between
the Chinese athletes. Huang Xu held off strong challenges from
teammates Zhao Sheng and Yang Wei to snag the well-earned gold
with 57.800 points. Zhao and Yang came on second and third with
57.725 and 57.575, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Eight of the top 10 finishers on the women's all-round
individual table come from the host nation. A relatively unknown
Rao Meizhen notched up 38.512 points to steal the gold from world
cup champions Liu Xuan and Kui Yuanyuan.
</P>
<P>
The only non-Chinese gymnast on the awarding podium was twice
French national champion Elvire Teza, who managed 38.012 points
to finish eighth.

JOHANNESBURG, September 24 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and Mexico
signed a cooperation agreement in New York on Wednesday night,
South African Foreign Ministry said in a statement Thursday.

<P>
Twelve lawmakers voted against the 23-member cabinet led by
Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh, two abstained and one was absent.
The speaker of the House does not need to participate
in the voting according to the Constitution, the Petra said.
</P>
<P>
The vote was conducted after the Lower House finished three-day
heated debate on the new government`s policy statement.
</P>
<P>
With the vote of confidence, the House members hoped that the
government will live up to its promises outlined in the policy
statement to combat corruption, unemployment and poverty.
</P>
<P>
They also called on the government to slow down efforts to
normalize ties with Israel under the peace treaty between the two
countries and focus on upgrading ties with Arab states.
</P>
<P>
They noted that Jordan`s ties with Arab states have been
harmed by the kingdom`s peace treaty with Israel and need to be
enhanced.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh Thursday delivered a speech in response, saying that
his government will do its best to fight against corruption, curb
unemployment and combat poverty.
</P>
<P>
Tarawneh`s cabinet, which was appointed by King Hussein on
August 20, a day after the previous government resigned, includes
many technocrats and was shouldered with the major task of
curbing unemployment and poverty and in effect reviving the
kingdom`s economy.

JOHANNESBURG, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho army chief
Lieutenant-General Makhule Mosakeng, forced to resign at gun
point by mutinous soldiers, resumed command of the Lesotho
Defense Force (LDF) Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili said Mosakeng and
the more than 60 senior officers who fled to neighboring South
Africa during the mutiny, which began on September 11, would
resume their positions immediately, South African Press
Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
"The commander, Lt-General Mosakeng, and senior management
will work in close cooperation with the commanding officers of
the intervention forces from Botswana and South Africa to restore
the command structure in the army and in the country as a whole,"
Mosisili reportedly told the state-controlled Radio Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
Mosakeng told reporters that he had been forced to resign and
that his resignation was not valid. Only King Letsie III had the
power to accept his resignation. He said he was therefore still
commander of the LDF.

"Arafat will not change a single word in his speech on this
issue and let the members of the General Assembly to judge who is
against the peace process," said the official in Gaza Thursday,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The words came as Israeli leadership is trying to advise Arafat
not to announce his statehood plan when addressing the General
Assembly on October 2.
</P>
<P>
Israel has repeatedly warned that if the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) declares a state next May, it will take tough
actions against the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is in New York
attending the General Assembly, renewed his opposition Thursday
when meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
He said that the creation of an independent state will mean
gains for the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu asked Arafat not to try to gain diplomatic support at
the U.N. for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
Israeli President Ezer Weizman and opposition Labor party
Chairman Ehud Barak also echoed Netanyahu's stance, asking Arafat
not to stage diplomatic activities or lobby the U.N. support for
his statehood campaign.
</P>
<P>
Barak said the PNA and Israel can reach an agreement on troop
redeployment and move onto the final-status talks, but he did not
say how.
</P>
<P>
Weizman said the announcement to declare an independent state
can cause more dangers to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel are haggling over a U.S. proposal
on Israeli troops withdrawal from the West Bank, and no tangible
progress has been made so far.
</P>
<P>
Israel's thwart and threat also met rebuttal from other
Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said "we can not work
as guards on lips of Mr. Netanyahu and we hope that Netanyahu to
refrain from using statements of threats, war and re-occupation,"
the Voice of Palestine reported.
</P>
<P>
PNA Cabinet Secretary Ahmad Abdel Rahman said Thursday that
Israel is conducting military trainings to raid Palestinian cities
in order to frighten the Palestinian people to halt its national
plan of declaring an independent state.
</P>
<P>
"This is a psychological war and nerve war, but Israel should
think a thousand times before they take any aggressive measures
against the Palestinian people," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no chance for Israeli extremists and
expansionists to move the clock needles backward, Palestinian
existence is a reality and is not a charity from the Netanyahu
government," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said the declaration of the Palestinian state is in
accordance with the Oslo accords and the international law.
</P>
<P>
The Oslo accords, which kicked start the peace process in 1993,
envisage that an independent Palestinian state will be created
when a five-year transient period ends in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
"Israel should commit to what is stipulated by the agreements
and their non obligation will mean that the entire world will
unanimously stand by the Palestinian people to face Israel," he
said.

<HEADLINE> India Rejects Unilateral Action Against Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- India Thursday called
upon the international community to join hands in fighting
terrorism, saying that "unilateral steps" in this area do not work
in the world.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee was addressing the 53rd General Assembly session.
</P>
<P>
"Unilateral steps can hardly stand in an open society, let in
the eyes of the international community," he said. "It should be
the primary task of all open and plural societies to develop
collective means for tackling this menace."
</P>
<P>
"We urge that the 1999 conference launch the process of
negotiations for an international convention to provide for
collective action against states and organizations which initiate
or aid and abet terrorism," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the current financial crisis, the Indian prime minister said
that "national regulatory mechanisms are unable to cope with the
impact of rapid movement of capital in and out currencies."
</P>
<P>
"In developing countries and in Western financial capitals,
there is now a growing acceptance that premature liberalization of
capital markets has been a primary cause of the current crisis,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Indian prime minister failed to touch on the impact of
nuclear tests his government conducted in May this year, which has
brought about the arms race in south Asia. He just said, "As a
responsible state committed to non-proliferation, India has
undertaken that it shall not transfer these weapons or related
know-how to other countries."

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho King Letsie III
was Thursday barred by the government from speaking to his nation
through state-controlled Radio Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
The country's Information and Broadcasting Minister Mnyani
Mphafi told local radio reporters that whatever was to go on air,
including the king's message, had to be approved by the
government, in particular, by Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili,
South African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Mphafi returned the statement to the king, who then sought
Mosisili's intervention, said SAPA.
</P>
<P>
The king's secretary returned to the palace with news that
Mosisili had refused to allow the king to speak.
</P>
<P>
In the prepared address, the king appealed to the Lesotho
nation to be calm, take stock of what had happened and put aside
their differences in a quest to normalize the nation, according
to SAPA.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties reacted angrily to the Lesotho government's
censoring the king, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
Mphafi also told Radio Lesotho employees and reporters to stay
at home until advised otherwise.
</P>
<P>
"As you know the station has not officially been opened and
for security reasons it will be best for you to stay at home
until you are told to return to work.
</P>
<P>
"Only a few of you will be asked to come to work," Mphafi
said.
</P>
<P>
Some employees reacted angrily to Mphafi's remarks, saying
those who had been chosen to come to work were aligned to the
ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy.
</P>
<P>
The station was closed last week following a blockade of its
entrances by opposition supporters.

<HEADLINE> Greece Calls for Political Solution to Kosovo Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Greece once again urged
Thursday the international community to find a political solution
to the Kosovo problem, saying that Athens was doubtful about the
effectiveness of a military intervention.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that Greece continued to have reservations
about the possibility of a strike by international forces on
Kosovo and would continue to urge a political resolution to the
problem.
</P>
<P>
He added that talk of an intervention was still premature
because the U.N. Security Council had not decided on the matter.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the U.N. Security Council demanded an immediate
cease-fire and negotiations to end the conflict in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) issued Thursday
an activation warning for a limited air strike and a phased air
campaign in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, where ethnic
Albanians made up 90 percent of its nearly 2 million population
and have been demanding independence from Belgrade.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Charge D'affaires Leaves Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Expelled Afghan Taliban
Charge D'affaires to Saudi Arabia Mawlawi Shehab Eddine Dalawer
left Riyadh Thursday for home, with the Taliban's embassy still
working, the Kuwait News Agency (Kuna) reported.
</P>
<P>
This was confirmed by Abdelwahab Moulawi Said, first secretary
at the Taliban's embassy in Riyadh, during a telephone interview
with Kuna.
</P>
<P>
Abdelwahab said Dalawer's departure "was to implement the Saudi
government decision on recalling its charge d'affires from Kabul."
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia on Tuesday recalled its charge d'affaires from
Afghanistan and asked the Taliban charge d'affaires in Riyadh to
leave the country "in keeping with national interests."
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is one of the three countries that have recognized
the Afghan Taliban government.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question on whether the Saudi decision is
related to Afghanistan's harboring Osama Bin Laden, a Saudi
dissident whose nationality was evoked years ago, Abdelwahab said
he "did not know the real reason, but believed it could be related
to the decision."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Taliban government would "do its utmost to
improve relations with Saudi Arabia and remedy any problem
standing behind the Saudi stance."
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia's move also came amid a worsening tension between
Iran and the Taliban militia which kidnaped 10 Iranian diplomats
and reporter in northern Afghanistan on August 8 and later killed
eight of them.
</P>
<P>
Abdelwahab said that the Afghan charge d'affaires left Riyadh
along with his family aboard the Saudi airlines.
</P>
<P>
The diplomatic representation between Saudi Arabia and Taliban
started in May, 1997, following Riyadh's diplomatic exchange with
Kabul which did not exceed the level of charge d'affaires.
</P>
<P>
Abdelwahab reiterated the Taliban regime and Afghan people's
appreciation for the Saudi leadership, saying "we consider Saudi
Arabia as elder brother for us and to all Islamic countries."

WASHINGTON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) Thursday announced the approval of a stand-by credit
for El Salvador in an amount of about 52 million U.S. dollars to
support the government's 1998-99 economic program.
</P>
<P>
The government of El Salvador expressed it intent to treat the
credit as precautionary.
</P>
<P>
The government's program for 1998-99 aims to maintain
sustainable high rates of growth, while containing inflation.
</P>
<P>
The program is targeted at a rate of GDP growth of 4 percent in
1998 and 4.5 percent in 1999, which is predicated on the
assumption that the turmoil in international markets does not have
a significant adverse effect on the country's exports or
investment in 1999.

WASHINGTON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton and Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah are meeting here Thursday
over the security in the Gulf and the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"It will range across all those issues that the United States
and Saudi Arabia work together on: combating terrorism, supporting
peace in the Middle East, security questions related to the Gulf,"
said White House spokesman Mike McCurry.
</P>
<P>
"They will talk about some of the efforts that we make together
to assure that the Gulf continues to be a reliable source of
energy resources for the world," he added

<HEADLINE> IDB Finances Nicaragua to Modernize Banking System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) Thursday announced the approval of 96
million U.S. dollars in financing to back the modernization of
Nicaragua's financial system and construction of a power plant.
</P>
<P>
Concessional financing of nearly 66 million dollars will
support a program that embodies a medium-term vision for the
financial system based on the principles of competitive and
efficient markets. Direct government intervention in the delivery
of financial services and the accompanying distortions it causes
will cease.
</P>
<P>
The IDB financing, from the Fund for Special Operations,
consists of a 65 million dollar sector loan and a 765,000 dollar
loan for technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Besides, a total of 30 million dollars in financing will
support the construction and operation of the country's first
private power plant since the country adopted a new law for the
electricity sector in 1997. The 50.9 megawatt diesel plant, to be
located 20 kilometers east of Managua, will help meet the
country's energy needs that are resulting from economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The financing consists of a 10.75 million dollar loan from
ordinary capital and 19.5 million dollars in financing to be
contributed by commercial banks under subscription of
participation agreements with the IDB.

<HEADLINE> Israel Opposes Unilateral Declaration of Palestinian State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The unilateral
declaration of a Palestinian state would cause the collapse of the
Middle East peace process, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu was responding to the repeated statement by
Palestinian leaders that they would proclaim an independent state
if a final peace agreement with Israel was not concluded by next
May.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 53rd Session of the General Assembly, Netanyahu
said the Oslo accords were not about meeting deadlines.
</P>
<P>
"An arbitrary, unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state,
in disregard of this purpose, would constitute a fundamental
violation of the Oslo accords. It would cause the complete
collapse of the process," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
"I strongly urge the Palestinian Authority not to take this
course. Such actions will inevitably prompt unilateral response on
our part," Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
"And this development will not be good for the Palestinians,
not good for Israel, not good for peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We must continue to negotiate, earnestly, continuously and
tirelessly, until a final peace agreement is reached. No other way
will do," he added.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians have been at odds over a U.S.
initiative under which Israel would hand over an additional 13
percent of the West Bank in exchange for Palestinian security
measures of fighting terrorism.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- India was prepared to
sign the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban-Treaty (CTBT) within one
year, Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee said here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 53rd Session of the General Assembly of the

<P>
"India, having harmonized its national imperatives and security
obligations and desirous of continuing to cooperate with the
international community, is now engaged in discussions with key
interlocutors on a range of issues, including CTBT," the Prime
Minister said.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee said India was already observed CTBT's basic
obligation since it announced a voluntary moratorium after
carrying out five underground tests in May.

<HEADLINE> IFC Redoubles Commitments to Asian Countries in FY 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) redoubled its commitments in Asian countries with
new investment and made more investments than ever in more
frontier economies around the world in 1998 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
In its 1998 Annual Report released here Thursday, IFC said that
in the 1998 fiscal year, which ended on June 30, IFC committed to
investment in 226 projects, 23 more than the year before, with a
total commitment of 5.1 billion U.S. dollars. The commitment
consists of 2.7 billion dollars for its own account and 2.4
billion dollars for the account of participant banks. The IFC
signed investment in 73 countries and regions, up from 60 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In order to help those hardest hit countries in the Asian
financial and economic crisis, IFC made new investments in Asia,
including four projects in South Korea, where it had not invested
in a decade, and two in Malaysia, where the Corporation re-entered
after an absence of seven years.
</P>
<P>
A total of 51 projects involving 1.1 billion dollars of
financing was approved and 768 million dollars was actually
committed to 30 projects in East Asia and the Pacific in the past
year.
</P>
<P>
To finance its lending program in developing countries, IFC
borrowed 4.1 billion dollars in 1998 fiscal year, almost entirely
in the international capital markets. IFC issued securities in 13
different currencies, including the Russian ruble, Estonian kroon,
and Israeli shekel.
</P>
<P>
IFC, founded in 1956 as the lending arm of the World Bank Group
for private sectors in developing countries, has 174 member
countries, including two new members added in the 1998 fiscal
year: Palau and Chad.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Panel Announces Schedule for Impeachment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Judiciary Committee of
the U.S. House of Representatives announced on Thursday it will
vote on October 5 or 6 whether to launch a formal impeachment
inquiry into charges against President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Chairman Henry Hyde, a Republican, said if the committee
approved the inquiry, the full House would vote on the measure,
probably on October 8 or 9.
</P>
<P>
"Like all Americans I want to bring this matter to closure as
soon as possible," Hyde said at a press conference. "The timetable
I've proposed today is the most expeditious schedule we can
follow. I urge everyone to be patient, allow our system of law to
work."
</P>
<P>
In a White House ceremony trumpeting the decline in the
nation's poverty rate, Clinton urged Congress to end political
wrangling and move ahead with other urgent business that Americans
were interested in.
</P>
<P>
But Congressional Republicans had made clear they would keep
impeachment before the public in the less than six weeks left
before the November election despite Democrats' calls to speed up
the process.
</P>
<P>
Hyde said at the end of next week the committee would be
briefed by its staff on the 65,000 pages of evidence handed over
by independent counsel Kenneth Starr but not yet released to the
public. The committee would meet in open session the following
week for the vote on whether to continue.
</P>
<P>
Among the items to be considered for the next round of public
release are the depositions of Clinton friend Vernon Jordan,
Clinton secretary Betty Currie, and Secret Service officers, a
transcript of the tapes of Lewinsky made by her former friend
Linda Tripp and the tapes themselves.
</P>
<P>
News reports quoted committee sources as saying that a battle
was still possible over release of the Tripp tapes, which contain
more sexual details but also material the Democrats think could
help the president.
</P>
<P>
"It's unacceptable to pretend to be conducting a bipartisan
investigation and then vote not to release the tapes," said
Representative Marty Meehan, a Democrat. "In the tapes, when you
can listen to them, you can get a better sense of the credibility
or lack of credibility."
</P>
<P>
Meehan also said he would like Starr himself to be called
before committee to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
At the White House, Clinton called for "progress over
partisanship... people over politics."
</P>
<P>
Asked if there was a way out of the scandal, Clinton said, "The
only way out is for people in Washington to do what the folks in
America want them to do, which is to take care of their concerns,
their children and their future. That's what I mean to do, and I'm
going to do my best."

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Supports Military Intervention in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano said here Thursday that the decision of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) to send troops to Lesotho
was aimed at restoring peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
Chissano told reporters at the State House that there was no
alternative. He denied the claim that Mozambique's stance on
Lesotho issue goes against that on the Congo crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We have made the decision as a step to bring all parties
involved in the conflict to dialog," the Mozambican president
said, adding that "Lesotho has been paralyzed as a result of
violence, with government organs and other institutions of public
services all out of operation."
</P>
<P>
As the vice-chairman of the SADC, Chissano stressed that the
decision of sending troops to Lesotho had been unanimously agreed
by South Africa, Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Botswana.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that "we will continue to make efforts so as
to solve the (Lesotho) problem through dialog."
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican president noted that his country did not sent
troops to Lesotho because it doesn't afford to.
</P>
<P>
He further explained that "we believed that something could be
done ahead of military intervention" in the case of the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The president pointed out that the decision on the DRC crisis
had been made by individual SADC states. Some countries,
especially those neighboring the DRC, regarded the crisis in the
country as explosive, said Chissano, therefore they decided to
intervene.
</P>
<P>
The troops of South Africa and Botswana entered into Lesotho
on Monday and met resistance by the mutinous Lesotho soldiers
with casualt on both sides.
</P>
<P>
The Lesotho crisis began when the opposition parties did not
accept the results of the May general elections, saying that the
government should resign because of its alleged rigging in the
votes.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Calls for Closer Ties With Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 24 (Xinhua) --A Tanzanian senior
government official Thursday called on Tanzania and
Mozambique to enhance their bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and International
Cooperation Emmanuel Mwambulukutu made the appeal in Dar es
Salaam when opening a one-day seminar to mark the 10th
anniversary of the Tanzania-Mozambique Friendship Association
(TAMOFA).
</P>
<P>
He said that although Tanzania and Mozambique share a common
border, it is sad to note that there have been few economic and
social interactions in recent years.
</P>
<P>
TAMOFA, however, has promoted people-to-people contact, and
played an important role in complementing the functions of the
foreign ministries of the two countries, said Mwambulukutu.
</P>
<P>
"TAMOFA remains a symbol of unity of the two brotherly
countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian official called on the two governments to sit
down together to discuss ways of promoting the bilateral
cooperation, especially trade links.
</P>
<P>
He also commended the efforts made by the association in
initiating projects related to the repatriation and resettlement
of refugees.

DAR ES SALAAM, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Air services in Tanzania's
southwest region of Mbeya which stopped two decades ago are expected
to resume by the end of next month.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Spending, Income Up at Same Pace in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Consumer spending in the
United States climbed up in August while personal incomes
increased to keep up the pace, the Commerce Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The spending jumped 0.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 5.84 trillion U.S. dollars after a rare 0.1 percent drop
in July, the first in two years, said to the department.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, personal incomes rose 0.5 percent, the strongest in
six months, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.17 trillion
dollars. Incomes rose 0.4 percent in July and 0.3 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believed that the income growth would have been more
robust if not for the nearly-two-month strike in the General
Motors (GM) and related layoffs at GM suppliers.
</P>
<P>
After-tax, or disposable, income grew 0.5 percent to a rate of
6.06 trillion dollars. And the average savings rate among
Americans declined to a 0.3 percent from a 0.5 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
The figure suggests some Americans are saving less to maintain
their standard of living or still are spending some of the stock
market gains they've accumulated over the past several years.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Americans continue to spend relatively freely and
domestic demand remains strong, spurred by the lowest long-term
interest rates in three decades.
</P>
<P>
The spending on big-ticket durable goods, items including
automobiles expected to last three or more years, rose 1.1 percent
last month after slumping 4.6 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
Spending on services in August advanced 0.7 percent while
spending on non-durable goods, such as food and fuel, rose 0.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
The most important component of income, wages and salaries,
rose 0.8 percent in August. Reflecting the GM strike,
manufacturing payrolls rose 1.3 percent after back-to-back drops
of 0.7 percent in July and June.
</P>
<P>
Business owners' income also increased, as did interest and
dividend income, rental income and transfer payments such as
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
Farmers' income, however, dropped, reflecting a decline in
commodity prices caused by the weak demand in Asia.

<HEADLINE> Interior Minister Offers to Resign Over Refugee Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Belgian interior
minister has offered to resign over the death of a Nigerian
refugee but the cabinet would not accept the resignation.
</P>
<P>
A cabinet meeting Friday persuaded Louis Tobback to retrieve
his resignation letter which he had sent to the prime minister's
office late Thursday, according to a written statement issued
after the cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
Tobback said in another statement that he had offered to resign
because of police errors in preparing the deportation of
20-year-old Semira Adamu who died Tuesday after being restrained
by gendarmes.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian woman died of a brain haemorrhage while being
subdued by the gendarmes who had escorted her aboard a
Nigeria-bound flight.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the police officers escorting Adamu had used a
cushion to muffle her screams has become a key issue for
investigation.
</P>
<P>
One of the two police officers under investigation over Adamu's
death has been disciplined in a similar case previously, according
to police sources.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian government has decided to suspend the country's
repatriation of refugees for the time being.
</P>
<P>
If Tobback's resignation was accepted, it would be the second
time within six months for a cabinet member to resign over errors
committed by the police.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, Tobback's predecessor resigned after
alleged child rapist and killer Marc Dutroux escaped from a
pre-trial hearing.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Labor Takes Lead Over Coalition: Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Australian Labor Party
(ALP) has taken a potentially decisive lead over the coalition of
the Liberal and National parties, with Opposition Leader Kim
Beazley clearly out-campaigning Prime Minister John Howard, the
major polls this week showed.
</P>
<P>
As the election campaign enters its final week, the average of
the four polls over the past week showed support for ALP climbing
for the second week in a row to 42.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Support for the coalition, meanwhile, fell for the first time
since the election was called on August 30, to 40.4 percent, a 1.7
point margin.
</P>
<P>
Labor is now ahead in three of the four polls - Newspoll, AC
Nielsen and Morgan, but trails badly in the Bulletin poll.
</P>
<P>
The fact the government's support fell in three of the polls
and was steady in the fourth indicates its campaign has run into
serious trouble.
</P>
<P>
After opening the election campaign two points behind the ALP,
the government received a significant surge in support in the
opening week to take an early lead.
</P>
<P>
But Labor, pegging back the government's lead in the second
week, has surged ahead over the past fortnight on the back of the
election debate between Howard and Beazley.
</P>
<P>
Although the polls clearly favor the ALP pulling off a
remarkable political comeback, returning Labor to power after only
one term in opposition, Beazley has said the mathematics were
against his party.
</P>
<P>
To win the October 3 election, the ALP must pick up an extra 27
seats, a task which will require a national swing of about four
percent.
</P>
<P>
Now the ALP has pinned its hopes on substantial gains in
Queensland and Victoria, as well as a few extra seats from
Tasmania. Beazley will venture into the National Party's heartland
in central Queensland.
</P>
<P>
Howard will campaign in Victoria where Labor has attracted
strong support.
</P>
<P>
So far as small parties are concerned, the One Nation Party is
the clear loser of the election campaign, with support steadily
sliding throughout the campaign. Pauline Hanson's support stood at
nine percent the week the election was called and has fallen every
week since to the present 6.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Democrats have been one of the major
beneficiaries whose support has now climbed to 5.1 percent, up one
percent from the start of the campaign.

routine.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian Hr. Ivanov and another Japanese A. Kasamatsu coming
on second and third, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the home crowd was treated to spirited performances
from China's young waves of gymnasts, led by 15-year-old Ling Jie
from Hu Nan province, who stole the limelight by two impeccable
performances on beam and uneven bars, which each earned her a
meet-high 9.850 and a pair of golds.
</P>
<P>
Her world cup champion teammate Liu Xuan had to settle for the
bronze on uneven bars, tying French national champion Elvire Teza
on 9.725 but lower than the silver medalist in the team event
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Another dazzling Chinese gymnast was world cup champion Li
Xiaopeng, winner of both the vault and parallel bars with 9.650
and 9.800 points respectively, serving note he may be the next
undisputed master of China's men gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
Much-touted Lu Yufu salvaged his China Cup trip by snagging
the gold with a 9.625 routine on men's floor exercise after
muffing his chances in yesterday's all-round event.
</P>
<P>
Local hero Dong Zhen gave the 5000-strong crowd something to
cheer about by swing to the rings title with a 9.800. His
teammates Zhao Sheng and Huang Xu rounded out the top three for
China.
</P>
<P>
Zhao, Thursday's all-round silver medalist, took his medal
haul to four by garnering the pommel horse title, edging A.
Kasamatsu of Japan and V. Vezchev of Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
The women's vault title also went to China. Olympian Kui
Yuanyuan vaulted on a solid landing to notch up a 9.537 and the
gold medal.
</P>
<P>
The women's floor seemed to be a close battle between Kui's
two teammates Huang Mandan and Rao Meizhen and the American girl
Elise Ray. Huang displayed a near-flawless 9.775 floor to take
the gold, beating Ray and all-round titlist Rao into second and
third on 9.750 and 9.600 respectively.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Urges Strict Enforcement of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Friday that transport and maritime authorities under
his administration will strictly enforce safety rules to prevent
another sea disaster from happening.
</P>
<P>
Estrada told reporters that maritime authorities have
recommended stricter safety procedure and measures for seafaring
vessels after the sinking of a passenger ferry last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he will not risk another mishap by lifting with
haste the preventive suspension imposed on Sulpicio Lines whose
inter-island ferry M/V Princess of the Orient sank off at the
mouth of Manila Bay last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The president also stressed that he does not want the
government to get blamed either for allowing un-seaworthy ships to
ply maritime routes, or for obstructing business by grounding
passenger ships.
</P>
<P>
Maritime authorities have suspended operations of Sulpicio
Lines pending an investigation into the mishap which left more
than 100 people dead.
</P>
<P>
The sea accident was the third involving this ferry operator
since 1987, when more than 4,000 passengers died after its ship
M/V Dona Paz collided with an oil tanker in one of the world's
worst maritime disasters. Ten months later, another Sulpicio-owned
vessel M/V Marilyn sank, killing more than 200 people.

<P>
MOSCOW, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Russia's newly-appointed Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov Friday emphasized the importance to
fight against "shadow economy" in creating a market economy in
Russia, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of the Interior Ministry collegium,
Primakov said, "Whether we can build a market economy of a
civilized type, break negative tendencies in business, change the
mentality of businessmen, distorted over the past years by crime,
depends on whether we are able to achieve an improvement in
fighting the shadow economy and economic crime."
</P>
<P>
The scope of the shadow economy in Russia surpasses 40 percent
of gross domestic product, according to the Interior Ministry of
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Primakov noted the Interior Ministry must make efforts to
support the anti-crisis measures of the government and the
president.
</P>
<P>
He meanwhile spelled out measures for consolidation of the
banking system, the ruble's stabilization, state monopoly on
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the premier also said the Interior Ministry
must toughly oppose separatist tendencies, which are the most
tangible in times of the economic hardships.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia earned 573,365
U.S. Dollars from tea export in 1997/98 financial year ending on
July 7, 1998, more than doubled that in the previous year,
according to an announcement made by the Ethiopian Coffee and Tea
Development Authority.
</P>
<P>
A local report Friday quoted the authority as saying that the
nation exported 226 tons of tea in 1997/98, compared with 115
tons in 1996/97. Out of the total 1997/98 export, 183 tons were
exported to Djibouti, 23 tons to Pakistan and 20 tons to Canada.

commercial farming did not start until the early 1980s. In
1997/98 the country sold a total of 1,531 tons of tea, in which,
226 tons was exported abroad and the balance went to the local
market.
</P>

<HEADLINE> HK's Education to Bring Up Youth Capable of Taking New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The ultimate aim of the
education in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) is
to bring up youth capable of taking challenges of the 21st
Century, a leading official of the SAR Education Department said
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference for the launching of the
"Synergy in the 21st Century -- Information Technology (IT) in
Education" project, Anthony Tong Kai-hong, Senior Assistant
Director of Education Department, said the competitiveness of Hong
Kong is confronted with tough challenges as the SAR approaches to
the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The toughest challenge to the SAR's education is that the local
teachers have to keep abreast of latest knowledge and information
in a rapidly changing time so that youth can be brought up to take
the challenges of the new century, he said.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that SAR's Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa had
stressed in his first Policy Address that Hong Kong should aspire
to be a leader in the information world of tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
To realize this, an ambitious five-year strategy had been
launched, which will, among others, incorporate IT elements in the
school curriculum and enhance the provision of technology in a
more structured framework. The target is to support teaching of 25
percent of the curriculum through IT by the year 2002, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jointly launched by the Education Department and local
organization The Lions Club of Metropolitan Hong Kong, the
"Synergy in the 21st Century -- IT in Education" project
encourages local teachers to apply more IT in education so as to
raise the standard of students.
</P>
<P>
There are two elements in the Project -- setting up of an
education software reference bank and IT in Education Excellency
Award.

<HEADLINE> 3 Lebanese Wounded in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Three Lebanese, including a
child and two Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army (SLA) militiamen,
were wounded in separate military conflicts in south Lebanon on
Friday, the Orient radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Ten-year-old Hussein Harb was wounded by Israeli shelling on
Iqlim Toufah area, a stronghold of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah,
or Party of God, which lies just north of the Israeli occupied
border strip in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is spearheading a guerrilla war to oust more than
1,000 Israeli troops and their allied SLA militia from south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim to protect its north from cross-border
attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Also in the day, the Amal movement, Lebanon's another
anti-Israeli Muslim group led by House Speaker Nabih Berri, said
that one of its units launched a machine-gun and grenade attack on
a SLA post at Suwidai village in Iqlim Toufah, killing or wounding
its members.
</P>
<P>
The SLA's official radio Voice of the South later confirmed
the casualties, saying two of its soldiers were wounded during
the clash.
</P>
<P>
The Amal's attack has brought to 38 the number of SLA
militiamen wounded in south Lebanon so far this year, in addition
to 27 killed.
</P>
<P>
Heavy losses the Israeli forces and the SLA have suffered
during the past years forced them into rethinking the wisdom of
keeping presence in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, Israel offered to withdraw from south
Lebanon provided that Lebanese government agreed on a negotiated
security guarantee for Israeli north.
</P>
<P>
A week ago, the SLA made a similar offer, saying it is ready to
withdraw from its controlled Jezzine, a predominantly Christian
town north of the occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
But it conditioned the withdrawal on that Lebanese government
troops agree to take over the vacated area to prevent Muslim
guerrillas from attacking them from there.
</P>
<P>
Beirut rejected both the offers, asking Israel to withdraw from
occupied Lebanese lands without any preconditions.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Rallies Strongly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar
rallied strongly Friday, finishing the session more than half a
U.S. cent higher.
</P>
<P>
The Arab Bank foreign exchange dealer, Scott Young, said the
local currency had been consistently bid on the day.
</P>
<P>
"It ran into some sellers around 58.55 U.S. cents first up and
backed off a little," he said.
</P>
<P>
But the bids were still there for the Australian dollar and it
traded to a high of 58.83 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 58.73 U.S. cents from 58.15
here Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
He said the possibility of more downside for the U.S. dollar
was also a boost for the local currency.
</P>
<P>
A rate cut in the U.S. would also lend a bid undertone to
commodities which would help the Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar was at 135.46 Japanese yen from 136.58 and
1.6747 German marks from 1.6833 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The fact that weakness in the U.S. dollar against European
currencies could not be translated as strongly to the U.S.
dollar/Japanese yen exchange rate was holding back moves in the
Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
"Because the yen is not keeping pace, Aussie is lagging a
little bit behind," Young said
</P>

<HEADLINE> Opinion Survey to Be Conducted on HK's New Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Hu Fa-kuang, chairman of
Hong Kong's Airport Consultative Committee (ACC), said Friday
that the ACC is commissioning an opinion survey on the new Hong
Kong International Airport at Chek Lap Kok.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to the airport with 13 other members of the ACC,
Hu said that this survey, to be carried out next month, aims at
seeking the views of four key groups of people, including arriving
and departing passengers, clients of air cargo companies and
management staff of airlines and air cargo companies, airport
users other than passengers, and members of the general public.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the views canvassed will represent a wide
cross-section of airport users as well as those who have not been
to the airport," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
"The results will reflect the level of services provided at the
airport and also give us an idea on areas where further
improvements are necessary," he added.
</P>
<P>
The survey will be conducted by the Social Sciences Research
Center of the University of Hong Kong in October and results are
expected in December, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the three-hour visit, K K Kwok, director of the New
Airport Projects Co-ordination Office, told the ACC members that
the brand new airport is functioning smoothly as a result of the
dedicated work of the many thousands of people working there.
</P>
<P>
The ACC party observed operations in the arrival and departure
halls and in the restricted areas as well as the baggage reclaim
hall. They also inspected operations at the Hong Kong Air Cargo
Terminals.
</P>
<P>
Kwok said arriving passengers wait no longer than 15 minutes at
immigration counters and are able to reclaim their baggage in
about 10 minutes on average.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the visit, Hu said while he was pleased with what
he had seen, efforts should be made to ascertain the views of
airport users so that further improvements could be made.

<HEADLINE> Roast Beijing Duck Originated in Nanjing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hu Changlin, the reputed leading chef in south China, said that
roast duck, pig and fish have been Nanjing's delicacies since
ancient times.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Yuanzhang, the first emperor of Ming Dynasty (1368-1644
A.D.), established his capital in Nanjing, and shortly thereafter
roast duck was added to the imperial menu.
</P>
<P>
His son Zhu Li ascended to the throne and moved the capital and
indeed the secret of roast duck to Beijing. The sweet brown sauce,
green onions and thin pancakes characteristic of Shandong Province
were added to Beijing roast duck.
</P>
<P>
The delicacy soon spread from the emperor's palace and became a
famous dish in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
Some people say the Beijing dish is somewhat salty, but roast
Beijing duck is nonetheless lighter and sweeter than the typical
Nanjing flavor.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Attorney General Gets Draft Letters From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian former president
Soeharto Friday submitted two draft letters needed by the Attorney
General's Office to pursue investigations on his alleged hidden
wealth.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Andi M. Ghalib told reporters that the
submission of the draft letters marks the start of the preliminary
investigations into the wealth the former president has allegedly
amassed during his 32 years in power.
</P>
<P>
President B.J. Habibie last week approved the formation of a
team, led by Ghalib and helped by the police and the Development
and Finance Comptroller, to question Soeharto in person.
</P>
<P>
Ghalib said the first draft letter constituted a special power
of attorney that would enable the Attorney General to receive
money from the alleged bank accounts under Soeharto's name, to be
later transferred to the government.
</P>
<P>
The second draft letter allows foreign banks to provide the
Attorney General's Office with information on the alleged bank
accounts under Soeharto's name.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, who stepped down amid mounting public pressure on May
21, has repeatedly said that he had no money, stocks or valuable
papers abroad and had never held any offshore bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
He also challenged anyone with corroborating evidence to report
the banks to the Attorney General's Office, and said he would
authorize that particular financial institution to release details
of the accounts.
</P>
<P>
Ghalib told reporters that he will soon form two teams, the
first to be in charge of tracing alleged bank accounts under
Soeharto's name and the second to be in charge of tracing
Soeharto's wealth.
</P>
<P>
He called on the people to stay calm and patient as the
investigations are still in their early stage.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, House of Representatives/People's Consultative
Assembly Speaker Harmoko told reporters Friday that he believed
the government is already seriously investigating Soeharto's
wealth through the Attorney General's Office.
</P>
<P>
"But if the government later proves not to be, the House will
use its 'right to query' to question the government about the
effort," he added.

<HEADLINE> More Ethiopians Doing Business With Djibouti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- More Ethiopians have
been doing business with their counterparts in Djibouti since
Ethiopian-Eritrean border dispute erupted last May, which cut off
Ethiopia's trade outlet in Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,730 small border area traders have been licensed
following the implementation of the Ethiopian-Djibouti border
trade agreement in May of this year, the Ethiopian Herald Friday
quoted a statement issued by the Dire Dawa foreign trade office
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Dire Dawa, second largest city in Ethiopia, is located at the
middle of 781-km Addis Ababa-Djibouti railway line. After the
border dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea erupted last May,
Ethiopia had diverted its trade outlet from Assab port of Eritrea
to port of Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the number of border traders has shown a
dramatic increase because the foreign trade office has devised a
plan to replace illegal traders by lawfully operating ones.
</P>
<P>
Accordik7to the agreement between the governments of Ethiopia
and Djibouti, these small traders may import and export goods
worth no more than 285 US Dollars.

<HEADLINE> China's Economic Growth Expected To Help Petrochemical Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- New technology and materials
in China's building industry are expected to accelerate growth of
the petrochemical industry, according to a State Bureau of
Petroleum and Chemical Industry official.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the International Chemical Industry Exhibition '98,
Li Chen said that plastics are increasingly used as a substitute
for traditional building materials like wood and steel as
evidenced by the expanded use of plastic doors and windows.
</P>
<P>
Growth of the petrochemical industry, one of China's pillar
industries, depends a lot on agriculture, construction,
electronics, and automobiles.
</P>
<P>
The State Bureau of Petroleum and Chemical Industry predicts
that by 2010, China's combined demand for gasoline, kerosene and
diesel oil will stand at 166.22 million tons, and that for ethylene
will be 10 million to 11 million tons. The increased use of
sheeting and drip irrigation will mean a greater need for plastics.
</P>
<P>
The amount of sheeting nationwide is expected to grow from 4.67
million ha now to 6.67 million ha by 2000, and that used for
greenhouses is expected to double.
</P>
<P>
China will have 20 million automobiles in 2000, and the market
for petroleum looks good. Improvements in models will mean an
increase in the use of plastics as a substitute for steel in
automobiles.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Urges Further Judiciary Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- China plans to strengthen
internal restructing of the judiciary in order to ensure justice,
eradicate corruption and enhance efficiency, according to Xiao
Yang, president of the Supreme People's Court.
</P>
<P>
The new central government was seated in March this year and
shortly thereafter instituted the Education and Restructuring
Campaign in response to criticism raised by deputies to the
National People's Congress (NPC). Courts at the provincial,
prefectural and county levels have thus far recouped
misappropriated funds of over 8.27 million yuan (one million US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The numbers of verdicts rendered during the second quarter of
this year jumped by 14.35 percent on figures for the first quarter
of the year.
</P>
<P>
Xiao said the judiciary must refrain from resorting to
complacency in light of the notable achievements.
</P>
<P>
"Further strengthening the judiciary remains as a long-term
task," said Xiao, noting that civil, economic and lower level
people's courts will be the focal points of the ongoing campaign
</P>
<P>
"Courts which failed to introduce concrete measures during the
initial campaign will be required to do so in the future and all
illegal trial procedure will be subject to investigation," said
Xiao, adding that "actions arousing public dissent will be
thoroughly examined and individuals responsible will be subject to
appropriate punishment."
</P>
<P>
The Supreme People's Court plans to introduce a number of new
measures to strengthen internal supervision, including inviting
NPC deputies, members of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and well-known public figures
to serve as special representatives to table both grievances and
proposals.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme People's Court plans to establish a liaison office
which will assist NPC deputies and facilitate their efforts to
supervise the work of judges.
</P>
<P>
Lower courts will establish special departments and assign
staffers responsibility for liaison work with people's congresses
on the same level.
</P>
<P>
Xiao added that documents, reports and other material issued
by courts should be submitted to assist the NPC in properly
supervising the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme People's Court and lower courts have introduced
strengthened regulations governing internal supervision.

CANBERRA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Australian sharemarket

in the United States, losses in key Asian markets and local
profit-taking.

Traders said news of the bailout of Long-Term Capital
Management LP in the United States also unsettled investors.
</P>

The all ordinaries index closed 51.5 points lower at 2,563.4,

a 3.5 billion U.S. dollars bailout of the hedge fund, Long Term
Capital Management, also was unsettling the market. Some of the
money was borrowed from commercial banks and investment houses.

Sixteen of the world's largest banks and brokerage firms were

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Firm Against Govt Takeover of PAL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada remained firm Friday on his decision against any
government takeover of Philippine Airlines (PAL), saying such a
move will further bleed anemic state coffers.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said that aside from having to deal with PAL's
creditors and the airline's debts amounting to over 90 billion
pesos (2.1 billion U.S. dollars), the government also stands to
lose more than 45 to 50 million pesos a day should it take over
the airline's operations.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he was fully aware that under the law and PAL's
Charter, the government can take over the airline to protect the
public interest.
</P>
<P>
PAL ceased operations at midnight Wednesday due to its
worsening financial situation and protracted labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said a government takeover would be futile because some
45 to 50 million pesos in public finds will be spent daily on an
unsafe investment and without even resolving the long-standing
dispute between the airline's labor unions and management.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Estrada denied reports that he had "coddled" PAL
chairman Lucio Tan, saying he even persuaded the businessman to
keep the airline operating for at least one month despite huge
losses.

water above warning marks for 94 days and record highs for 40 days.
</P>
<P>
Water levels in flood-ravaged areas along the Nenjiang and
Songhua rivers in northeastern provinces continue to recede,

Although urban agriculture has maintained rapid growth in the

according to a member of the China Agricultural Society, who says
that poor transport facilities in suburban areas hinder
development.

Moreover, he said, the central government needs to develop
measures to limit the blind expansion of large cities and to

<HEADLINE> Iran Shows off Military Force amid Tension with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Amid tension with the Afghan
Taliban militia, Iran on Friday showed off its military force by
displaying three newly-developed medium-range Shahab-3 (Meteror-3)
missiles in a military parade here.
</P>
<P>
Decorated with colors, the three giant missiles came at the
end of the military parade held in the Azadi (Freedom) Square on
the occasion of the Defense Week to mark the eight-year war
between Iran and Iraq from 1980 to 1988.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time for Iran to show the Shahab-3 missile
with a range of 1,300 kilometers, which was successfully tested on
July 22 and provided Iran with a new deterrent force.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami said at the parade ceremony
that Iran should build up powerful armed forces to defend the
country's sovereignty and territorial integrity, particularly the
eastern border following the latest development in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
"The Iranian government pursues a policy of tension-reducing,"
Khatami said, but the policy should be supported by the strong
armed forces, including the army, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards
Corps (IRGC), the security and the Basij (volunteers) forces.
</P>
<P>
He strongly condemned the Taliban's crimes of massacre of
innocent people, particularly the killing of eight Iranian
diplomats and a reporter early last month in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Praising the armed forces for their devotion to the country
and the Islamic revolution during the eight years of the
Iran-Iraq war, the Iranian president said Iran's future will
surely be better than today, with the support of the armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
To show their capability to defend the country, the Iranian
armed forces held military parades simultaneously throughout the
country, with the biggest one held in Mashhad, Khorasan province
which borders Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Following the killing of the Iranians by the Taliban in
northern Afghanistan, the IRGC has deployed 70,000 troops and the
army built up 200,000 forces along the 850-kilometer border with
Afghanistan and announced their readiness to carry out any order
to take revenge on the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Despite of heavy pressure for military action against the
Taliban, the moderate government of President Khatami expressed
hope that the issue with the Taliban could be solved through
peaceful means, though it reiterated that Tehran reserves the
right to take any measure to defend the country and rights of its
people.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The State Statistics Bureau
says that China's reform has created more job opportunities and
that, by 1997, there were approximately 700 million people at
work, 214.85 million more than in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Rapid growth in the private sector has helped this a great
deal, it reports.
</P>
<P>
Reforms have helped the employment structure, and the number of
employees in the service sector in 1997 was 3.8 times that of
1978, an average annual growth rate of 7.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The SSB says that there was a rise in the number of female
employees during the period. In 1997, there were 323.64 million,
accounting for 46.5 percent of the working population.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more educated people have joined the labor force
since 1978. There were 24.36 million college graduates at work in
1997, 5.4 times the 1982 figure, according to SSB.
</P>
<P>
The SSB says that China's labor market system has played a
major role in job searches as more job placement centers are
formed.
</P>
<P>
However, there are still the problems of laid-off workers and
the social security system, the bureau says, and a unified
comprehensive new social security system is urgently needed.

reportedly attempting to bring the government and opposition to
the negotiating table, but the country's Foreign Minister Tom
Thabane rejected the king's proposal.
</P>
<P>
"How can we talk to political leaders who appear to have
encouraged their supporters to commit crime and sow anarchy
throughout the country," Thabane was quoted as saying by the
South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
Thabane said those responsible for the mayhem, arson and
looting of shops in the capital of Maseru and other parts of the
country in the past three days should face the "strong arm of the
law".
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Lesotho's opposition parties had accepted
the king's invitation for round-table talks to resolve the
political crisis stemming from claims that the May 23 general
election was rigged in favor of the LDC.
</P>
<P>
Vincent Malebo, spokesman for the opposition alliance, said
Friday: "We are ready for talks with the government, but only
under the leadership of the king. The ball is now in the hands
of the government."
</P>
<P>
There were unconfirmed reports that King Letsie III had been
on the side of opposition parties. His palace was once used as
headquarters for opposition party supporters.
</P>
<P>
The opposition believed that talks could help resolve the
crisis in the country caused by "forces of aggression", said
Malebo, apparently referring to the military intervention early
this week by South Africa and Botswana at the request of the
Mosisili government.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe and Mozambique have also expressed full support for
the military intervention in favor of the Lesotho government.

<HEADLINE> Good Air Quality In China's Key Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Air quality was relatively
good in China's major cities for the past week, but the air quality
dropped slightly in some northern cities, according to the China
Environmental Monitoring Center.
</P>
<P>
The center's lastest air-quality report shows the cities of
Beijing, Tianjin, Urumqi, Taiyuan, Zhengzhou, Guangzhou and 5
others suffered from slight air pollution on September 18-24.
</P>
<P>
The major problem in Beijing and Guangzhou was nitrogen
oxide. The 9 others suffered from suspended particles.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the temperature varied greatly day and night in
northern China over the past week, and the wind speed was slow, so
that it did not disperse the pollutants in air.
</P>
<P>
The cities of Chongqing, Shanghai, Kunming, Hangzhou, Guilin,
Shenzhen, and 23 others reported good air quality.
</P>
<P>
The cities of Yantai, Shantou, Haikou, Xiamen, Ningbo and
Beihai all enjoyed excellent air quality during the
period.

<HEADLINE> Duo Expelled from Tour of Spain for Failing Blood Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Daniel Clavero and Juan
Carlos Dominguez of the Vitalicio Seguros team, both failed the
official blood test, were thrown out of the Tour of Spain which
reached Alto De Navacerrada on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Calveros was lying seventh overall before Friday's 20th stage.
</P>
<P>
The two Spaniards were expelled after Union Cycliste
Internationale testers had made their early-morning call at five
team hotels in Segovia.
</P>
<P>
The tests were introduced last January to protect "the health,
safety, and welfare" of racers.
</P>
<P>
Anyone who had a blood concentration, known as the haematocrit
level, exceeding 50 percent is considered unfit to race.
</P>
<P>
Alex Zuelle, winner of the last two Tours, was cleared after
tests on Friday. He and some of his Festina team mates face
suspensions because of alleged use of erythropoietin, which
artifically enhances the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood.
</P>
<P>
Other teams tested included those of race leader Abraham Olano
and his chief rivals, Frenchman Laurent Jalabert and Spain's
Fernando Escartin.

<HEADLINE> New Words Enter Chinese Vocabulary (1) by Yu Zheng and Hao Jinghua </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- When U.S. President Richard
Nixon strolled on the Great Wall in 1972, the noise from his
pocket amazed almost all the Chinese security personnel, but more
than two decades later, anybody on the streets of Beijing knows
what a beeper is.
</P>
<P>
The beeper was still an alien in the world's most populous
country when it opened its doors to the outside world in late
1978. And, people knew little about some new words like the
"market economy", "stock market speculation", "karaoke", "cool",
"multimedia", "web surfing", and the "mobile phone".
</P>
<P>
But, economic reforms and science and technology are making
these everyday words now and people can easily find them in the
media.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Language Commission, China's most
authoritative voice on standardized usage, the country has
published more than 30 dictionaries of new words in the last
decade.
</P>
<P>
More fresh words and phrases appearing in various areas in the
country keep those lexicographers busy.
</P>
<P>
The reforms and opening up have eased the social situation in
China, says Dong Kun, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences' Institute of Linguistics, and many new words have
appeared and interesting phrases developed.

<HEADLINE> New Words (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As 'market economy' becomes a pet phrase of state leaders,
common people use the 'credit card', and "second occupation"
(meaning moonlighting) or "Xiahai" (jumping into the sea of
commerce), meaning quitting one's life-long job to do business on
one's own.
</P>
<P>
China's bullish market in the stock exchange brought many new
words about stocks, words like "Gumin" and "Guping", meaning
shareholders and comments on the stock market respectively.
</P>
<P>
With the freedoms and more open-minded society, Chinese are
accepting the challenges they are meeting in daily lives, and
"Xiagang" and "Zaijiuye", meaning unemployment and re-employment,
and "Zhongdiangong", or piece workers, have come into existence.
</P>
<P>
This shows the changes and adjustments they've made in their
minds, Dong says.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of new phrases have appeared annually in recent years,
says Yu Genyuan, a research fellow at the State Language
Commission's Institute of Applied Linguistics. More than 7,000 new
words have become common since 1978, he says.
</P>
<P>
The tidal wave of facts and new ideas and concepts resulted in
new expressions during the social transformation, Yu explains. He
has led the state's only research group of study of new words and
their usage.
</P>
<P>
China has seen a lot of new words come and go over the
years. During the Northern and Southern Dynasties (420-589), there
were many borrowings in the northern and southern parts of the
country. The spread of Buddhism during the Tang Dynasty
(618-907) also introduced many words to China.
</P>
<P>
After the democratic movement of May 4, 1919, foreign words
from politics and the sciences used by the intelligentsia spread
across the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
In contrast to the extreme political language of the new
People's Republic of China in 1949 and the difficulties during the
Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), economic words are becoming more
active in modern times.
</P>
<P>
"The rigid, frozen, and combative linguistic style has been
changed into soft, smooth, polite and humane forms in many cases,"
Dong says.
</P>
<P>
As Chinese become familiar with the Internet and VCDs these
days, they can look back at the 1970s and the most luxurious items
that everyone wanted, the watch, bicycle and sewing machine.
</P>
<P>
By the early 1980s, it had become color TV sets. Although a
great number of words used at that time did not survive, some are
still in use, like "Tequ", or 'special economic zone', "Lixiu",
meaning veteran revolutionaries who have retired from
government posts, or "Xiangzhen Qiye", or township-run
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Along with the national development, some new words and phrases
can be expected to last for a period of time, phrases
like 'invigorating China through science and education', 'economic
soft landing', 'high-tech', 'poverty relief', 'intellectual
property rights', and of course 'one country, two systems'.
</P>
<P>
"The changes in the style of the Chinese language show the
society becoming more relaxed and free, and the people becoming
humorous rather than poker-faced," says Zhou Hongbo, associate
research fellow at Commercial Press's dictionary editing section.
</P>
<P>
One British linguist said that one should never use a
dictionary that is more than ten years old, but in today's China,
some dictionaries are out of date a lot sooner than that.

rate cut.
</P>
<P>
They also said the market index managed to recoup most of its
losses in late dealings on selected buying of blue chips by

<HEADLINE> Hope Dashed for Early Ending of Fuel Scarcity in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Hope of an early ending of
lingering fuel scarcity in Nigeria has been dashed following the
announcement that repair work on a major refinery in Kaduna would
take 14 more months.
</P>
<P>
Alhaji Dalhatu Bayero, the managing director of the Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), who was accompanying
Nigerian leader Abdulsalam Abubakar on his visit to the United
Nations, made the disclosure Thursday in New York.
</P>
<P>
According to Bayero, the Turn-Around Maintenance (TAM) of the
Kaduna Refinery in north Nigeria would be postponed for 14 months
because of the need to replace damaged boilers and turbines.
</P>
<P>
The maintenance of the Kaduna refinery, being handled by the
French oil company Total at a cost of 217 million U.S. Dollars,
was expected to have been finished two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
It was reportedly earlier that the maintenance could not be
finished on time because of serious damages to key equipment
during ocean transportation.
</P>
<P>
Total has been accused of being technically unfit to handle
the job, but the French firm insisted that it undertake the job
as agreed and would finish the TAM by year end.
</P>
<P>
The NNPC official said Nigeria would take remedial measures to
mitigate the effect of the delay.
</P>
<P>
The measures include taking crude meant for the Kaduna plant
to overseas refineries for processing and importing 40 batches of
fuel cargoes, totaling 146.6 million liters for the fourth
quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, a major world oil producer with a daily production of
over two million barrels, has been suffering from lingering fuel
scarcity in the past few years, due to ailing refineries.
</P>
<P>
The former government of late General Sani Abacha has been
accused of deliberately letting down the refineries so as to
profit from massive fuel importation.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Restaurant Receipts Decline in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's restaurant
receipts and purchases continued to decline in the second quarter
of 1998, the government reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The total restaurant receipts decreased by four percent in the
second quarter on a year-on-year base to 13.8 billion HK dollars
(1.8 billion U.S. dollars), while the total purchases made by
restaurants fell by seven percent to 4.8 billion HK dollars (62
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Census and Statistics Department said that the receipts
shrank by seven percent in volume after discounting the effect of
inflation.
</P>
<P>
Chinese restaurants were hit hardest, with total revenues
slumping by ten percent in value and 12 percent in volume. Bars
also suffered from slack business, with receipts down 0.2 percent
in value and seven percent in volume.
</P>
<P>
Non-Chinese restaurants saw their total receipts up four
percent in value and roughly unchanged in volume.
</P>
<P>
Fast food shops, miscellaneous eating and drinking stores buck
the trend to record a rise of five to six percent in the value of
total receipts, and an increase of two to three percent in volume.
</P>
<P>
The half-year total restaurant receipts dropped by four percent
in value and eight percent in volume compared with the same period
of 1997.

<HEADLINE> France to Assist Nigeria in French Language </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The French government has
pledged to assist Nigeria in its efforts to make French its
second official language in the west African country.
</P>
<P>
Bruno Aguesse, Attache for Cultural, Scientific and Technical
Cooperation of the French Embassy to Nigeria, made the remarks
Thursday at a reception in honor of the winners of this year's
French Competitions organized by the Nigerian Association of
French Teachers.
</P>
<P>
He said that in cooperation with state ministry of education,
the French government had selected 90 secondary schools
throughout Nigeria for its pilot scheme to introduce French into
secondary schools, The Post Express reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the scheme which is aimed at improving the teaching of
French, he noted, students in the selected secondary schools can
learn the language for six years.
</P>
<P>
So far, about 90 French teachers are sent to France and 50 to
Lome of Togo annually for training while the Center for French
Teaching and Documentation in Jos trains between 800 and 1,000
teachers every year.
</P>
<P>
Aguesse confirmed that the Nigerian government had expressed
its desire to have French as a second language in secondary
schools all over the country.
</P>
<P>
At the end of August, Comptroller-General of the Nigeria
Immigration Service Alhaji Sahabi Dange disclosed that all
immigration officials of Nigeria are to study French language to
enhance their ability to communicate with foreign nationals
coming into the country.
</P>
<P>
As most member countries of the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) have French as their official language,
the Nigerian government endeavors to enhance French-speaking
ability of its people in order to promote cooperation with its
neighboring countries in the sub-region.

<P>
HONG KONG, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong stocks slipped
Friday after rising for three consecutive trading days, to end
the week barely above 7,700 points.
</P>
<P>
The blue chip index retreated 133 points, or 1.7 percent, to
close at 7,701.61 Friday, and turnover shrank to 4.416 billion HK
dollars (566 million U.S. dollars). The decline followed an
overnight drop of some 150 points in Wall Street Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Banking shares fell steeply by about three percent or 300
points Friday, while utility, commercial and industrial counters
all lost more than one percent.
</P>
<P>
Red chips gained 1.82 percent, or 14.27 points, to end at
799.88 Friday, and H shares edged up slightly.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Hang Seng Index jumped 330 points, or 4.4 percent
Thursday, propelled by hopes that the U.S. Federal Reserve might
cut interest rates soon. Thursday's sharp rise expanded gains over
the previous two days, when the market already advanced some 330
points, recouping the 275-point loss on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President Calls for Resumption of Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides has called on Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash to
return to the negotiating table to find a settlement to the
protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The president issued the call in New York Thursday at a
gathering on "the Cyprus Question: Prospects for a Settlement,"
organized by the U.S. organization, the National Committee on
American Foreign Policy, Cyprus News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot president is currently in New York to attend the
U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said that "I will be calling on Denktash to come and
join me to work together on a solution based within the
parameters of the U.N., which will be beneficial to both
communities."
</P>
<P>
He also gave his full support for contacts between Greek and
Turkish Cypriots, especially the youth, noting that the lack of
contact creates serious problems and is not a healthy basis for
the future federation.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has banned bicommunal contacts since last December
following the European Union (EU) decision to start accession
talks with the Clerides-led Cypriot government in March.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the deployment of Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft
missiles, Clerides said "if the other side is prepared to sit
and begin negotiations on the substance of the problem on the
basis of U.N. resolutions I would suspend indefinitely the
deployment of the missiles."
</P>
<P>
"I have also said that if the other side is prepared to sit at
the negotiating table to negotiate that which the U.N. resolutions
have asked us, that is the reduction of forces and armaments, I
will again postpone the arrival of the missiles until we agree to
a reduction of arms."
</P>
<P>
Clerides, however, stressed that "failing that, I will not
agree to any postponement simply because I am threatened by
Turkey."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus struck a deal with Russia last year to buy S-300
missile system in a bid to boost its air defense.
</P>
<P>
The deal was opposed by the U.S.-led western countries, and
triggered threats from Turkey which vowed to strike the missiles
if they are deployed on the island.
</P>
<P>
Under the international pressure, the Cypriot government has
already postponed the delivery of the missiles from August until
November this year.
</P>
<P>
Clerides emphasised the need for the international community
to exert pressure on the Turkish side, saying that the prospects
for finding a solution in Cyprus depend on how actively the
international community in particular the U.S. would act in making
Turkey realize that "it must abide with the will of the
international community and negotiate sincerely within the
parameters the U.N. Security Council has set."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island after a
failed coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has maintained a 35,000-strong force in northern
Cyprus, which was declared in 1983 by Turkish Cypriots as
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus", recognized only by
Ankara.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Calls for Regional, Int'l Trade Links </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa (COMESA) has urged its members to integrate
into both the regional and international markets so as to promote
economic development.
</P>
<P>
The regional body also recognized the role of the private
sector in the reconstruction of the regional economies, Zambian
Daily Mail reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
COMESA underlined the importance of economic integration and
globalization for its individual members.
</P>
<P>
"Most COMESA countries are individually too small to achieve
economies of scale in production and marketing of their products
and need to work together as a region if they are to achieve
significant levels of economic growth and compete in a world
market which is increasingly dominated by large trading blocks,"
it said.
</P>
<P>
"Economic and social forecasts for the region suggest that the
outlook for the future is promising provided member states adopt
and implement strategies which will further outward oriented
regional integration in the process of globalization," said
COMESA.
</P>
<P>
On the role of the private sector in the overall economic
strategies, COMESA said the industry marks an important component
of the process and the economic future of the eastern and
southern African region is almost totally dependent on the
performance of this sector, it said.
</P>
<P>
The regional body acknowledged the importance of foreign and
local investment in achieving economic growth, saying "although
COMESA can offer an attractively sized and harmonized market for
over 300 million people of the region, and although the region
has large mineral and agricultural wealth in which there are
exciting investment opportunities, the member states need to
continue to offer a stable and attractive political and economic
environment."
</P>
<P>
Countries that have espoused economic reform are better placed
to achieve economic progress, said COMESA, adding "structural
adjustment and economic reform at the national level make it more
likely that regional integration measures will succeed in those
countries which are no longer operating under constraints of
import substitution."

<HEADLINE> WB Puts Africa's Fate on Leadership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The quality of African
leaders, especially their capacity against corruption, is
critical to Africa's future economic success, the just-released
World Bank's annual report said.
</P>
<P>
"Africa's leaders hold the key to the success of the
continent's economic, social and political growth and stability,"
claimed the report issued worldwide Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"A number of its (African) leaders have recognized the
stranglehold that corruption has on development efforts.
Countries including Uganda, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Benin and Malawi
have requested help from the bank to establish national
anti-corruption programs," said the report.
</P>
<P>
"When corruption has threatened to undermine development
objectives, the bank has made its views public. In some
countries, corruption has been a central feature of country
assistance program discussions," it noted.
</P>
<P>
The bank also spelt out more clearly than previously that
those African governments which are seen to be accountable and
transparent in their dealings will be receiving aid support in
the future.
</P>
<P>
"Growing evidence that the impact of development assistance is
most effective in countries that pursue sound economic policies
has guided the bank to be increasingly selective in its lending,"
the report said.
</P>
<P>
It recogniz that Africa's leaders face "tough challenges"
before they can succeed in deepening macro-economic stabilization
programs and "re-shaping the role of the state by improving
capacity to manage resources, ensuring delivery of social
services and creating attractive business environments."
</P>
<P>
One key issue, stressed the report, is the importance of
attracting new investment, not only from abroad but from Africans
with assets abroad.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank said it is estimated that some 37 percent of
all African assets are now held abroad, far higher than any other
region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bank said, it also needs "to be more flexible
in developing true partnerships with African nations." The
bank's lending to Africa rose by nearly two-thirds last year to
2.87 billion U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Out of 37 sub-Saharan African states, 21 recorded positive per
capita income growth rates of five percent or more last year.

<HEADLINE> No Middle East Economic Summit in 1998: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The World Economic Forum
will not sponsor a Middle East and North Africa economic summit
this year due to the stalled peace process, the Israeli daily The
Jerusalem Post Friday quoted a top forum official as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We don't think that the region would feel comfortable this
year having a summit as in the past. What was a product four
years ago isn't suited for this year," Gregory Blatt, director of
the Geneva-based organization, told the paper in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Instead of holding a MENA summit, the forum will highlight the
Middle East region in its annual January gathering in Davos,
Switzerland, Blatt said. Middle East businessmen on the chief
executive officer (CEO) level will be invited to take part, he
said.
</P>
<P>
This is a break from the format of the previous regional
conferences, held first in Casablanca, Morocco, in 1994 and
subsequently in Amman, Cairo, and last year in Doha, Qatar.
</P>
<P>
The Doha conference, which was downgraded to a
ministerial-level gathering from a summit due to boycotts from a
number of Arab countries, disbanded without deciding on a venue
for the next parley. None of the possible sponsors volunteered to
host the event.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli official said the failure to hold the economic
summit this year is a "punishment to the region as a whole."
There were a few Arab countries willing to host the event, but
they were pressured by strong Arab governments that did not want
the conference to take place this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
But "this is not the end of the MENA process," the official
said, noting that there is a chance the conference could convene
again in 1999 if the peace process gets back on track.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 25 (Xinhua) -- South Africa Friday
welcomed Pakistan's decision to sign the nuclear test ban treaty,
and India's announcement that it was ready to conclude
discussions in this regard.
</P>
<P>
In his statement available here, South African Foreign
Minister Alfred Nzo described the decisions of Pakistan and India
as "positive developments which the world has been waiting to
hear."
</P>
<P>
The two countries' signing and ratification of the test ban
treaty is important for the early entry into force of the treaty,
Nzo noted.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee told the United
Nations General Assembly Thursday that his country wanted the
treaty to go into force no later than September 1999.
</P>
<P>
Prior to Vajpayee's announcement, his Pakistani counterpart
Nawaz Sharif said Wednesday that his country was ready to adhere
to the nuclear test ban treaty, but that would depend on whether
India resumes its tests.
</P>
<P>
The two south Asian countries conducted a series of nuclear
tests in May, which were condemned by South Africa and many other
countries in the world.

LAGOS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalam Abubakar confirmed that his government has recovered a
substantial amount of money from the family of former leader,
late General Sani Abacha.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- A total of 760 kilograms of
pure cocaine were seized by Turkish anti-narcotics police squads
Thursday in a freighter off the coast near the southern Turkish
port city of Mersin, the leading daily Milliyet reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
A police patrol boat intercepted the ship for search and found
the narcotics in a container, the largest haul in the last few
years, a police spokesman was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen suspects including three foreign nationals were taken
into custody, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. anti-narcotics authorities had been
following the ship sailing from Chile to Europe and informed the
Turkish police of the possible shipment of drugs on the ship.
</P>
<P>
According to him, four companies including a U.S. firm were
involved in the incident and most of the drugs are prepared to be
transported to Europe except a small part of sales in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has long been used by Turkish and foreign drug dealers
as a springboard to smuggle narcotics from southeastern Asian
countries to European markets.

NEW DELHI, September 25 (Xinhua) -- At least 25 people, most of
them school children, were killed and 28 others seriously injured
when a rail engine rammed into a state road transport corporation
bus at an unmanned level crossing near Bothalapalem village in
Andhra Pradesh of South India Friday.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said that the majority of the 65
passengers in the bus were school children bound for Miriyalguda
town for the tenth class supplementary exam. The mishap occurred
when the speeding engine of a goods train hit the rear portion of
the bus.
</P>
<P>
The injured had been admitted to hospitals. "We are yet to
ascertain the exact cause of the mishap. The steep terrain at the
unmanned level crossing might have blocked the view of the
approaching engine," police said.

<HEADLINE> 2 Missing, 8 Injured in Plant Explosions in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Two people were missing and
eight injured in a series of gas plant explosions in Australia's
Victoria state, and all industry and home owners in the state were
ordered to stop using gas Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Police have evacuated houses within a 5 kilometer radius of the
plant, the state's main source of gas, because of fears that
200,000-litre containers of propane could explode, the Australian
Associated Press (AAP) reported.
</P>
<P>
But the AAP did not say how many houses or residents were
involved in the evacuation.
</P>
<P>
A huge fire continued to rage through an Esso plant Friday
night, in south-eastern Victoria near Sale, about 170 kilometers
southwest of Melbourne, after a series of explosions brought the
state's gas supply to a virtual halt.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is extremely serious - all industry and all
large customers have been instructed to turn off their gas," said
David Guthrie-Jones, spokesman for the Victorian Energy Networks
Corporation (VENCorp), the state's gas transmission system
operator.
</P>
<P>
"All domestic consumers must also turn off gas appliances -
particularly any heating and cooking appliances."
</P>
<P>
He said these restrictions would allow central emergency
services, such as hospitals and nursing homes, to maintain gas
supplies.
</P>
<P>
Five explosions ripped through the Esso plant at about 12:30
p.m. Friday, setting off a series of fires which burnt unabated
and consumed a significant element of the plant.
</P>
<P>
The fires were so large that firefighters from local
firefighting department and the plant had been forced to withdraw
to devise the best plan to fight it.
</P>
<P>
Peter Morris, a television reporter from Channel Seven nearing
the scene in a helicopter, said the fire could be seen from about
30 kilometers away.

<HEADLINE> Barzani: New Phase Starts in Northern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Massoud Barzani, leader of
the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) has said that the peace
accord signed last week between his group and another Kurdish
faction opens "a new phase" in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the English newspaper Daily
News, which was published Friday, Barzani said that the document
signed between himself and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK)
Chairman Jalal Talaban is of great significance as it officially
ends the bloody conflicts between the KDP and PUK, two powerful
Kurdish factions in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Stating that he and Talabani had agreed to establish a
"regional authority" and not a central government in northern
Iraq, Barzani noted that an eventual settlement should be reached
within the framework of ensuring Iraq's territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
"What we are saying is that we need to have a solution for the
future with a central government within the territorial integrity
of Iraq, a solution that would be acceptable to our people," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Barzani and Talabani reached a peace agreement in Washington
on September 18 under the auspices of U.S. State Department
officials, which is an important step in resolving the knotty
northern Iraq problem.
</P>
<P>
The peace accord sets forth a timetable for reconciliation and
revival of a unified, regional administration based on the rule
of law and democracy.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it also contains provisions for regional elections,
revenue sharing based on the needs of the population and
assurance of security for the borders.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Turkey KDP and PUK allegedly backed by Iran have been
fighting for the control of northern Iraq which has become a
power vacuum as a result of the Saddam Hussein regime's defeat in
the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the implementation of the peace accord, Barzani
said that he would meet with Talabani in Ankara in early November
to decide on the concrete measures to that effect.
</P>
<P>
While hailing the signing of the KDP-PUK accord, Turkey has
once again stressed that the northern Iraq issue should be solved
on the basis of the territorial integrity of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The whole problem is to fill the authority vacuum in northern
Iraq. An ultimate settlement should definitely be based on Iraq's
territorial integrity," a Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman told
a press conference last week.

<HEADLINE> Africa Tops WB's Investments to Private Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Africa, compared to other
regions, has the largest number of projects approved this year by
the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the lending arm of
the World Bank to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Thus it reflects the World Bank's priority of working in
developing countries, the bank's annual report released worldwide
Thursday shows.
</P>
<P>
There were commitments for 54 projects with 81 projects
approved for amounts of 33.5 billion Shillings (558.3 million
U.S. Dollars) and 40.7 billion Shillings (678 million Dollars)
respectively across the continent.
</P>
<P>
The thrust of the work in Africa was in mobilizing and
allocating domestic savings by creating a better-developed
financial structure particularly in Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire as
well as expanding local entrepreneurship and building
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Michael Hooper, IFC head of Nairobi office, said Thursday that
despite the financial crisis in Asia which will curb IFC's
investment portfolio, the corporation intends to remain a major
player in the promotion of projects aimed at helping reduce
unemployment and poverty in Africa.
</P>
<P>
In the coming fiscal year, IFC would set up hubs in Nairobi,
Johannesburg and Abidjan to strengthen its ability to work on the
ground and implement larger projects than the ones it is
currently authorized to do, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hooper urged African countries to learn from the experience of
the Asian crisis on the importance of transparency and the way
business is done, noting that Africa suffers directly from the
crisis through reduced prices of primary commodities.
</P>
<P>
This year, IFC invested in two hospitals and a charcoal
producer that will use the invasive wattle tree as raw material
in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Hooper said the corporation also invested in the first modern
bulk grain handling and storage facility in Kenya's Indian Ocean
port of Mombasa this year.
</P>
<P>
However, he said IFC was disappointed with the slow pace of
privatization in Kenya, adding that the country is lagging behind
Uganda and Tanzania in privatization and urged the government to
speed up the process.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Flight Attendants to Stage Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Almost 400 flight attendants
of Lebanon's national carrier Middle East Airlines (MEA) have
approved their first ever strike to protest against the company's
refusal to meet their demands.
</P>
<P>
After a general assembly meeting at the company's headquarters
on Thursday, MEA's cabin crew personnel decided to take the step,
without specifying the exact date or duration of the protest
action, the Daily Star reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time we've called a strike, but we won't say
when until a day before," head of the flight attendants' union
Robert Feghali told the paper.
</P>
<P>
The union signed a labor agreement in January this year with
the previous MEA board chaired by Khaled Salam, who has since
resigned after allegations that he was involved in the fraudulent
leasing of three Airbuses from Singapore Airlines.
</P>
<P>
The agreement stipulated that flight attendants should receive
a 20 percent salary increase and deserving attendants should
benefit from promotion.
</P>
<P>
Feghali said that new MEA Chairman Mohammed Hout refused to
recognise the employees' right to move up the promotional ladder
and only agreed to increase the portion of their salaries.
</P>
<P>
He added that if the protest action failed to achieve the
union's demands, they would turn to the government which will
then appoint an arbitration committee to issue a final decision
binding on both sides.
</P>
<P>
MEA, 99 percent of which is owned by the country's central
bank, has been beset with financial and managerial problems in
recent years with its 1997 losses reaching 53 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In July, the company's pilots staged a similar strike causing
loss of over 1.25 million dollars for the airline.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Analysts Optimistic About Hong Kong's Economy Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- After this year's
difficulties, a gradual economic recovery is expected in Hong Kong
in the next two years, if Hong Kong makes full use of its own
advantages and possible changes in the overall economy, some
Beijing analysts say.
</P>
<P>
They say that, having experienced the negative effects of the
Asian financial crisis, the government of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) and local people face three
challenges: financial stability, economic recovery and economic
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's economy suffered a serious decline this year
because of the regional financial crisis and economic bubble, and
international speculators used the opportunity to cause further
turbulence in Hong Kong's financial market. The SAR government
adopted some countermeasures to protect the stability of the
financial market, which won wide support from the public and
raised confidence.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Jingping, vice-director of the State Statistics Bureau's
International Statistics and Information Center, says that Hong
Kong is an international free port with well-developed service and
trade industries and that tertiary industry accounts for over 80
percent of its gross national product.
</P>
<P>
There are indications that the outside environment of Hong
Kong's economy will have some positive changes, he said.
</P>
<P>
In Zheng's view, the Chinese mainland and the United States are
Hong Kong's top two trade partners. So far this year the mainland
has managed to maintain economic growth at above seven percent and
that eight percent for the year is possible. Economic growth in
the U.S. is estimated to be about 2.9 percent this year. The
steady development of the two trade partners will help Hong Kong's
recovery.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Economic Recovery (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Recent analyses by many international economic and financial
institutions indicate that the economies and currencies of Asian
countries are bottoming out, which will benefit Hong Kong's export
and tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Zheng says that the strength of the U.S. Dollar is being
challenged by the Euro and and gradual recovery of the Japanese
Yen and other Asian currencies and that a devaluation of the
U.S. Dollar is inevitable. As a result, the Hong Kong Dollar,
which is pegged to the U.S. Dollar, will also devalue, which will
help Hong Kong's trade and tourism as well.
</P>
<P>
Analysts in Beijing say that the fundamentals of Hong Kong's
economy are still very good. With its highly-developed free market
mechanism, strong capital, legal system and outstanding management
personnel, Hong Kong will remain an ideal place for international
investment.
</P>
<P>
Economist Wei Jianing says that Hong Kong's financial industry
is well developed and has a broad line of fund-raising tools. When
its capital advantage is combined with the science and technology
of the mainland, it is possible that Hong Kong could become a
Silicon Valley of China or even Asia.
</P>
<P>
Wei, who is director of the State Council Development Research
Center's Financial Research Institute, says that high-tech risk
investment could turn speculative funds in Hong Kong's financial
market into investment funds and short-term capital into long-term
capital.
</P>
<P>
A view shared by these economists is that Hong Kong's economic
restructuring will be painful but that restructuring is
beneficial for clearing the bubble and increasing Hong Kong's
competitiveness and that this will provide a solid foundation for
the recovery.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Plunge in Tokyo on Wall Street Falling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices tumbled in Tokyo
Friday after the near-collapse of a major U.S. hedge fund sent share
prices on Wall Street falling overnight.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 481.94 points, or 3.39
percent, to close at 13,723.84 and easily erased Thursday's 3.02
percent gain.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, dropped 28.08 points or 2.60 percent to
1,049.93.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section decreased to an estimated 370 million
shares from Thursday's 460 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Steel maker NKK was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the euphoria felt throughout the world equity markets
Thursday over a possible cut in U.S. interest rates vanished as New
York's Dow Jones industrial index plunged 1.87 percent on news that 15
major international banks have come to the rescue of Long-Term Capital
Management L.P., a high-flying hedge fund that is on the verge of
collapse.
</P>
<P>
Financial issues were hit hard on news that the Japanese government
is not in favor of using public money to help the Long-Term Credit
Bank of Japan (LTCB) waive its loan claims on nonbank affiliates.
</P>
<P>
The news regarding LTCB depressed investors because it means the
ailing corporate lender may have a harder time clearing away its
problem loans, something it must do to merge with Sumitomo Trust and
Banking.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,342 issues listed on the First Section, losers overwhelmed
gainers 1,004 to 177, with 114 issues ending unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Troubled Bank May Be Re-Opened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Normal banking operations
may soon resume at the Trust Bank, Kenya's seventh biggest
commercial bank which was put under statutory management due to a
run by depositors last week.
</P>
<P>
A rescue package has been put in place to re-activate the
bank, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We foresee the bank re-opening for normal banking business
very soon," said Michael Muhindi, Trust Bank's interim manager
who was appointed by the Central Bank of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Muhindi asked Thursday all deposit customers of the bank to
immediately contact their respective branches for a copy of the
proposed new depositors' agreement, which they should complete as
required and "expeditiously return to the branch".
</P>
<P>
However, he did not reveal further details over the rescue
work.
</P>
<P>
First to be put under the statutory management of the Central
Bank of Kenya (CBK) was Reliance Bank Limited which was accused
by the CBK of issuing checks worth 304 million Shillings (about
5.07 million U.S. Dollars) which were not backed by deposits.

Trust Bank, was taken over by the CBK after it suffered run by
depositors when it failed to honor checks amounting to 360
million Shillings (about 6 million U.S. Dollars). The bank had
for long been locked in a legal tussle with a private company.
</P>
<P>
The Bullion Bank was taken over last Friday because of a
600-million-Shilling (10 million U.S. Dollars) debt. The three
banks have closed down since being put under control of the
central bank.
</P>
<P>
A following move by the CBK to restore depositor confidence,
in particular among the small banks through a salvage program,
has stemmed the seeming mass run by depositors.
</P>
<P>
The CBK has called an emergency meeting of the banks' top
officers to map out strategies at keeping them afloat.
</P>
<P>
Banking sources view the rescue package put in place for Trust
Bank as part of the proceedings of the meeting and are optimistic
other banks put under statutory management may bounce back into
business.

LUSAKA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Preferential Trade Area
(PTA) Bank is to increase its capital base from the current 500
million to five billion U.S. Dollars in the next century, Zambia
Daily Mail said Friday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the paper in Lusaka Thursday, Hardy
Pemhiwa, the bank's director of information and technology, said
that the PTA Bank hoped to meet the target by expanding its
services to cater for a wider market.
</P>
<P>
"The bank is growing from strength to strength and we are now
intending to capture a bigger client-base to include non-members
of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA),"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our target is to increase the capital base to about five
billion from 500 million Dollars in the next millennium," Pemhiwa
observed.
</P>
<P>
He added that the bank was further considering increasing the
ceiling for loan disbursements to customers.
</P>
<P>
PTA is the predecessor of the existing 20-member COMESA which
is located in Lusaka, capital of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The Burundi-based PTA Bank was founded in 1986 and its
operations include financing PTA projects and trade-related
activities and managing PTA travelers' checks.

<HEADLINE> Major Australian Parties Vie For One Nation Preferences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Australia's two rivaling big
political parties, the ruling Liberal Party and the opposition
Australian Labor Party, Friday appealed to Pauline Hanson's One
Nation Party supporters for their second preferences in a bid to
win the October 3 election.
</P>
<P>
The moves came with the latest opinion survey showing One
Nation Party preferences would be crucial to the election outcome.
</P>
<P>
Australian Prime Minister John Howard Friday conceded his
government was in danger of losing and warned that the Labor Party
could scrape into power on the back of One Nation Party
preferences.
</P>
<P>
Under the nation's preferential voting system, voters are
required to rank candidates in order of preference, and to be
elected, a candidate must achieve an absolute majority, namely at
least 50 percent plus one vote, either on first preference or
following distribution of preference votes.
</P>
<P>
If no candidate has won an absolute majority, preferences are
allocated, starting with those of the least-supported candidate,
until an absolute majority is obtained.
</P>
<P>
The latest A.C. Nielsen poll shows support for the ruling
coalition has fallen a point to 41 percent, trailing the Labor
Party's 43 percent. Once the likely preferences are taken into
account, the Labor Party is on 52 percent and the coalition on 48
percent.
</P>
<P>
"Now I would say to One Nation voters... I don't agree with the
policies of the party that you are proposing to vote for, I don't
think they have anything to offer, but when you cast your vote
think of your preference," Howard told Melbourne radio 3AW.
</P>
<P>
"I quite unashamedly want the preference vote of all minor
parties, or the voters of all minor parties, not the minor parties
themselves."
</P>
<P>
Opposition leader Kim Beazley accused Howard of hypocrisy and
said the Labor Party had always argued for voters' preferences but
had never done a deal with One Nation.
</P>
<P>
But Gary Gray, secretary of the Labor Party's national
secretary, made his own appeal to One Nation supporters to vote
against the ruling party by directing preferences to Labor.
</P>
<P>
Lynton Crosby, campaign director of the Liberal Party, admitted
the election is tight and every vote would count.
</P>
<P>
Support in Australia for the racist One Nation Party, founded
by Pauline Hanson last year, averages 6 percent, recent opinion
surveys have found.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Leader Calls for Lift of Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian military leader
General Abdulsalam Abubakar has appealed to the international
community to lift sanctions against his country as demonstration
of its support for the on-going democratization process.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar made the call Thursday in New York when he addressed
the 53rd session of the United Nations General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Abubakar reiterated his government's
commitment to handing over power to a democratically elected
civilian administration on May 29, 1999.
</P>
<P>
He said the current changes in the country could best be
described as a "silent but peaceful revolution" and called on
Nigerians still on self-exile to return and join the
democratization process.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar stressed his government's commitment to respect for
human rights, adding that the government's promise on
de-congestion of prisons was in line with its avowed commitment
in that regard.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria was sanctioned by the West after the annulment of the
June 12, 1993 presidential election. Further sanctions were
imposed in 1995 for executing author Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight
other minority activists.
</P>
<P>
Its relations with the West, however, has improved since
Abubakar took office in June, as the new leader has since taken
drastic measures in promoting reconciliation, human rights and a
new transition to civil rule program.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, the general also condemned terrorism around the
world, especially the recent bombings of the United States
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and called for collective
efforts to stamp out the menace.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar called for the accelerated reforms of the U.N.
Security Council, saying that the democratization of the U.N. was
necessary to engender loyalty and commitment by members.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets With French Prime Minister (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin,
who is currently on an inspection tour of this capital city of
east China's Anhui Province, met with visiting French Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his appreciations of the fact that Jospin
attaches importance to Sino-French relations since he resumed the
prime minister's post and voiced his conviction that Jospin's
current China trip would push forward bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
China and France enjoy a longstanding relationship, Jiang said,
adding that the leaders of both countries have maintained frequent
contacts with each other in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed to his visit to France in 1994 and French
President Hirac's China trip in May last year, when the two heads
of states signed Sino-French Joint Statement, pledging that the
two countries would establish a comprehensive partnership oriented
to the next century.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the current international situation is
undergoing profound changes and that peace and development remain
the main trends of the times. The tendency of a multi-polarized
world is turning increasingly obvious with the international
situation becoming more relaxed, he acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Jiang added, unstable and uncertain factors still
exist and the old world political and economic order, which is
unjust and irrational, remains basically unchanged. He added that
the process of a globalized world economy is accelerating,
bringing about both opportunities and risks.
</P>
<P>
Under these circumstances, China and France should have all the
reasons to enhance consultation, expand common ground and increase
cooperation from a historic and strategic point of view, so as to
contribute to the setting up of a just and rational international
political and economic order in the next century, Jiang said.

<P>
Jiang also briefed the French visitors on China's domestic
situation and the work of post-flood rehabilitation in the flooded
areas.
</P>
<P>
He told Jospin that China's flood control has won an all-round
victory and the people are going all out with the rehabilitation
work in the flood-hit regions.
</P>
<P>
The flood fighting drive has eloquently demonstrated the unity
of the Chinese army and people and their indomitable spirit and
heroism, as well as the cohesion of the Chinese nation, Jiang
noted.
</P>
<P>
Jospin said his meeting with President Jiang in Anhui is of a
special significance, which help acquaint himself with the efforts
of local people to fight flood and develop economy.
</P>
<P>
China's resolve to carry out reform and opening up to the
outside world remains unshakable despite the impact of Asian
financial crisis and the devastating flooding in the country this
year, Jospin said, adding that he had highest esteem for this
resolve.
</P>
<P>
The French prime minister also admired China's great
changes. China has constantly advance its social progress while
maintaining its political stability, and this represents the most
efficient growth mode, Jospin said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Jospin said, France values its ties with China,
adding that his current China tour is aimed at furthering the
comprehensive partnership between the two countries.

Sabah (Morning)
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Embassy in Uganda Targeted by Terrorists: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Eighteen suspected
terrorists held by Ugandan security confessed that they had
targeted the U.S. embassy here the day the Nairobi and
Dar-es-Salaam embassies were blown up in early August.
</P>
<P>
The terrorist activities were backed by Sudan and Saudi
terrorist financier Osama bin Laden, Friday's New Vision daily
quoted Muruli Mukasa, the State Minister for Security, as saying
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mukasa said the plotted bombings here were planned to be more
serious and devastating than those in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Uganda, the Post Office and a downtown market were
also targeted, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
He said the alert security personnel detected the explosives
in time, but declined to say the types and quantities of the
powerful explosives.
</P>
<P>
The suspects, including Ugandans and Somalis who allegedly
received financial backing, training and other facilitation from
Khartoum and Osama bin Laden, will be produced in courts soon
after investigations.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan Somalis recently arrested include a Sheikh
Abdulayi. However, there is confirmation in the report that
Sheikh Abdulayi was the Ugandan sheikh recently said to have been
trained in Sudan under Laden.
</P>
<P>
A police commander said the suspects will only be extradited
if the U.S. government requests the Uganda Judicial Service to do
so because Kampala has no extradition agreement with Washington.

<P>
ALGIERS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Algeria has decided to skip
the 33rd chess Olympiad slated no September 26 in Elista, Russia,
local reports said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Algerian Youth and Sports Department was quoted as saying that
Algeria was forced to skip the tournament as it will cost a
accommodation fee of 33,000 US dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, Algeria was still to compete in the Chess World
Championships slated in October in Spain.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Algeria also failed to show up for the 32nd chess

<HEADLINE> Foreigners In Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Armin Wolfgang Lang, a German
executive with Beijing Holiday Inn Crown Plaza, has a lot to say
about his life in China.
</P>
<P>
"More than ten years ago when I first came to Beijing, local
people usually looked at me as if they were looking at a monkey,"
he says, but "Now, I can walk leisurely in the streets."
</P>
<P>
More than a decade ago, Lang had to go to the Beijing
Friendship Store, which was designated for foreigners, to get
things he wanted. But still he felt that the goods were not good
enough for such a special shop.
</P>
<P>
Now, he says, "We foreigners can buy goods at any stores which
have plenty of commodities."
</P>
<P>
There are some 30,000 foreigners in the Chinese capital and
more than 2 million overseas visitors annually. Although they
account for only a small part of the Beijing's 13 million
residents, they have a large impact on the urban landscape.
</P>
<P>
In the eastern part of the city, there are communities of
foreigners, with markets, restaurants, bars, schools, clinics and
recreation facilities catering to the special interest group.
</P>
<P>
Lang usually takes a walk to the Forbidden City, the imperial
residence of emperors of the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911)
dynasties. The museum there is a little more than two kilometers
from the Beijing Holiday Inn Crown Plaza. He said he loves to chat
with local people and even invites them to his home.
</P>
<P>
In the past, ordinary Chinese people were not allowed to have
contact with foreigners individually, let alone invite them into
their homes. But, this is a thing of the past. At present, there
are about 800 people in Beijing marrying foreigners each year.
</P>
<P>
There are also nearly 200,000 well-educated Chinese working in
foreign-funded enterprises in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
Liu Chengshe, of the Beijing Public Security Bureau, says that
foreigners will feel freer in Beijing. In the past foreigners
coming to Beijing had to go through many procedures before getting
visas, now it is much simpler. And restrictions on areas in Beijng
where foreigners can visit have also been cancelled, he says.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners also now pay the same amount as Chinese for tickets
to tourist spots.

<HEADLINE> S. African Rand's Rally Raises Hopes for Rate Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 25 (Xinhua) -- A strengthening Rand
has pushed fears of a recession into the background and raised
hopes for an interest rate cut, local media reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Rand reached its best level at 5.76 against the U.S.
Dollar Thursday, up from a low of 6.40 in July.
</P>
<P>
South African industrial and financial shares were driven
higher by a rebounding currency in moderate trade on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
If the strengthening of the currency continued, interest rates
would begin to fall, allowing the country to escape a full-blown
recession, The Star newspaper quoted Econometrix chief economist
Azar Jammine as saying.
</P>
<P>
"At some point, speculators have to borrow Rands. If the Rand
is made sufficiently expensive, as our Reserve Bank has done, the
cost of paying interest on borrowed Rand exceeds the profits they
hope to make," said Jammine.
</P>
<P>
The prime lending rate of commercial banks now stands at 25.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
"One reason could be that speculators are disillusioned, and
are now buying back the Rand they've sold and cutting their
losses, creating a demand.
</P>
<P>
"Exporters bring more Rand back into the country before it
strengthens further. They're scared the Rand might rise and try
to rush out and get it at today's rate before they get fewer Rand
for their Dollars."
</P>
<P>
Jammine said the government and exporters did not want to see
the Rand remain too strong for too long because the gold price in
the Rand would start to fall.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Welcomes Foreign Investment to Build Old-Folks Homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The leading Chinese
industrial city of Shanghai will institute preferential
measures to induce domestic and foreign investment in building
more old folks homes.
</P>
<P>
Vice-mayor Feng Guoqin said the municipal government has
adopted a regulation to encourage the building of more of these
facilities in this city where one out of every three residents
will be elderly by the year 2025.
</P>
<P>
This regulation, which becomes effective on October 1, welcomes
enterprises, government bodies, social organizations and
individuals to invest in the building of old-folks homes.
</P>
<P>
The city will provide preferential policies for non-profit
old-folks homes in the areas of taxes and fees collections.
</P>
<P>
The vice mayor said profit-making old-folks homes will be
allowed to set prices themselves.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has 2.34 million people over 60 years of age,
accounting for 17.8 percent of its total population.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that the aged population in the city will reach
4.69 million in 2025, which will then be 33 percent for the total
population.

<HEADLINE> Eight Injured In Gas Plant Explosion in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Eight people were injured in
a series of explosions Friday at a big gas plant in Australia's
Victoria state, leaving the state's gas supplies under threat.
</P>
<P>
Five explosions ripped through the Esso plant near Sale, about
170 kilometers southwest of Melbourne, at about 12:30 p.m. (local
time), setting off a series of fires which were burning unabated
and consuming a significant element of the plant, the state's main
source of gas.
</P>
<P>
The fires were so large that firefighters from local fire
fighting department and the plant had been forced to withdraw to
devise the best plan to fight it, the Australian Associated Press
reported.
</P>
<P>
One person was critically injured with severe facial and body
burns.
</P>
<P>
Peter Morris, a television reporter from Channel Seven nearing
the scene in a helicopter, said the fires could be seen from about
30 kilometers away.
</P>
<P>
"It's a very large fireball probably two or three square
kilometers in size," Morris told local radio 3AW.
</P>
<P>
"As we approached the scene from about 30 kilometers away we
could see a large plume of thick black smoke probably rising about
15 kilometers into the air."
</P>
<P>
Three major fires were still burning out of control at 3:30
p.m. and a large storage tank was drenched by sprayers so that it
did not get too hot, local fire fighting department spokesman
Peter Philp said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Victoria Energy Networks Corporation (VENCorp),
the state's gas transmission system operator, warned that domestic
supplies would be severely restricted if the problem was not
quickly resolved.
</P>
<P>
VENCorp said no gas was coming ashore from Bass Strait, and an
Esso spokesman confirmed a temporary shutdown of gas and crude oil
supplies during the emergency.
</P>
<P>
"There is only the gas in the pipelines to maintain supplies,"
a statement issued by VENCorp said.
</P>
<P>
A local police spokesman said the cause of the explosions was
not known.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time this year that gas supplies from the
Esso plant have been affected.
</P>
<P>
In June, a 10-meter ice plug blocked the main supply line into
the plant, which is Victoria's major source of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
State-wide restrictions were imposed at the time, forcing
factory closures in 100 industry sectors at an estimated cost of
30 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Developing Information, Finance, And Technology Sectors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's Mayor Xu Kuangdi
says that the city will give priority to the information, finance,
and technology sectors in the years to come and make information
technology a leading source of revenue by early next century.
</P>
<P>
Xu told the '98 Pacific Rim Forum, sponsored by the China
Council for Promotion of International Trade's Shanghai Branch
with help from Dragon World Co. Ltd. of Australia, earlier this
week that Shanghai will catch up with moderately developed
countries in per capita GDP and will become an international
economic, finance, and trade center by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
It plans to encourage more overseas banks to start opening
branches in the city and to give overseas financial organizations
wider access to Chinese currency business and to start offshore
financial services, he says.
</P>
<P>
The city will also make a great effort to expand the capital
market and standardize the money market to ensure healthy and
rapid development of the financial sector. It will also
concentrate on high-tech information, pharmaceutical, and new
materials industries by increasing cooperation with overseas
companies.
</P>
<P>
For the past several years, the city has been improving
infrastructure, increasing spending on environmental protection
and afforestation, speeding up rebuilding of old city areas, and
building more new residential quarters to make it a more
attractive place for investors.

<HEADLINE> Istanbul Mayor: Conviction Not to End His </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's pro-Islamic Istanbul
Mayor Tayip Erdogan has declared that the 10-month prison sentence
would not deter him from continuing his political career, local
Daily News reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a crowded press conference at the Istanbul
municipality building Thursday, Erdogan said that "this is the
wrong decision. The public conscience has found me not guilty. This
unjust ruling has opened a new era. A new struggle has begun."
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Supreme Court of Appeals Wednesday upheld the
sentence for Erdogan and the court decision will go to the
Interior Ministry, which will ask the Council of State to end
Erdogan's tenure as mayor.
</P>
<P>
The 45-year-old mayor was found guilty by the State Security
Court in Diyarbakir, southeast Turkey in April "for inciting
hatred based on religious differences" in a speech at a political
rally last year.
</P>
<P>
"Our mosques are our barracks, our minarets are our bayonets,
our domes are our helmets and our believers are our soldiers,"
Erdogan said at the rally, reading from a poem by nationalist poet
Ziya Gokalp.
</P>
<P>
Outside of the municipality building, over 30,000 supporters
blocked streets and chanted anti-government slogans to protest
the conviction.
</P>
<P>
"The ruling is a tragedy in the history of our justice
system. It casts the shadow of politics on the courts," Erdogan
said in front of his supporters.
</P>
<P>
Chief Prosecutor Vural Savas has already asked the appeals
court to act with speed to uphold the verdict and accused Erdogan
of being a "cheap bully."
</P>
<P>
Erdogan was elected mayor in March 1994 on the Islamist
Welfare Party (RP) ticket. When the RP was shut down in January
this year, he joined the Islamist Virtue Party (FP).

<HEADLINE> Lu Yufu, a Rising Star to World Podium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Sportswriter Shi Ting
</P>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 25 (Xinhua) -- For the time being, Lu Yufu
is the gymnast most talked about in the Chinese Cup
International, not because he is emerging as a new gold medal
reaper of the ever-growing Chinese gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
Truly, he's yet to claim a major title to his credit, Lu Yufu
is nevertheless the odds-on hot candidate most likely to deliver
the best.
</P>
<P>
"Lu is the strongest amidst the new generation of the Chinese
men gymnasts," head coach Huang Yubin said, "he is the man tipped
to become the right successor to Li Xiaoshuang."
</P>
<P>
Two years ago in Atlanta, the United States, Li Xiaoshuang
awarded China its first-ever all-round Olympic gold medal with
his superb triumph over Russian legendary Alexei Nemov.
</P>
<P>
In Lu's ability, Huang said he has deep belief even though his
protege was still to botch up his chances at the China Cup
International which was going on here in the Tianjin Sports
Center, the venue for the next year's world championships.
</P>
<P>
In the last rotation of the all-round battle last night, Lu
sat down on his much-hyped vault, which is waiting to be named
after him, for a modest 9.125. The result dragged him to the
fourth place in the overall standings and costed him the berth
for tonight's apparatus finals.
</P>
<P>
"If I stuck, I could win," Lu said after his unique
"handspring sideways 2 1/2 tucked back salto" vaulting which he
originated and displayed for the first time in the Goodwill Games
in New York this summer.
</P>
<P>
The courage to perform the most incredible vault touched the
hearts of the entire gymnastic community, especially after Sang
Lang's tragic fall in a practice vault at the Games broke the
17-year-old's neck and left her paralyzed in hospital.
</P>
<P>
"I was shocked and then very much moved," Gao Jian,
vice-president of the Chinese Gymnastics Association (CGA) said,
"It's a real commitment for him to stick with the routine."
</P>
<P>
"Lu is a very brave man indeed," former triple Olympic
champion Li Ning echoed.
</P>
<P>
"I just go out and do my best and put everything else aside,"
Lu said, "I don't allow myself to get into what-ifs."
</P>
<P>
The popularity for the 20-year-old Cantonese around here is
evident. The stadium bursted into gusts of applauses when he took
the floor and performed his tricks as technically sound and
artistically pleasant.
</P>
<P>
"He has the calibre of skills, and now he just needs to
perfect them," Gao Jian said, noting that improving consistency
is the biggest hurdle for Lu to cross over.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Lu has made considerable progresses. In the national
championships prior to the China Cup, Lu hit three of his four
vaults and earned a meet-high 9.85 to his merit.
</P>
<P>
"This was probably his best meet in terms of hitting
percentage," Gao said.
</P>
<P>
But what counts best is to peak when what matters most, saying
the Asian Games this December, next year's Worlds and Sydney 2000
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Maybe then Lu Yufu can prove to be a worthy successor to Li
Xiaoshuang.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Beefs up Security Along Border with Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
strengthened security along the border with Uganda following a
fierce fight between Ugandan troops and rebels in eastern Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The heavy exchange of gunfire between the Ugandan government
troops and the rebel Lords Resistance Army, took place earlier
this month seven kilometers away from the Kenyan-Ugandan border,
the East African Standard newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Thus it caused panic on the Kenyan side in the Mt. Elgon
district, sending Kenya's security on alert, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The Mt. Elgon District Security Committee has ordered
surveillance and patrols in border posts to phase off the area
from the run-away rebels.
</P>
<P>
Mt. Elgon District Commissioner John Munguti said Thursday
that his men were on the lookout to ensure Kenya's territory is
not used by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
"We have beefed up security and surveillance along the common
border to ensure that no run-away suspected armed rebels gain
entry in the area," he said.

<HEADLINE> Tanasugarn to Challenge Seles in Princess Cup Semis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 25 (Xinhua) - Thai ace Tamarine Tanasugarn
beat Amy Frazier of the United States here on Friday to clinch a
semi-final berth against Monica Seles in the 450,000 US dollars
WTA Princess Cup tennis tournament.
</P>
<P>
The powerful Tanasugarn chalked up a 6-1, 6-3 win over the
American who struggled against strong winds over the center court.
</P>
<P>
"It's my first tournament that I've done pretty well in Japan,
I was always here since juniors. I feel great, I just play my
best and have fun and enjoy," said 21-year-old Tanasugarn, who
also achieved a doubles semi-final berth with Elena Likhovtseva
of Russia on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"It was very windy today and it was very difficult for both of
us, so I just tried to hang in there and hit the ball into the cou
rt. I played safe today, not hitting a lot of unforced errors,"
said unseeded Tanasugarn.
</P>
<P>
Tanasugarn ended Frazier's winning streak as the latter had
beaten rising 16-year-old Croatian Mirjana Lucic and No. 3 seed
Amanda Coetzer of South Africa in the first two rounds.
</P>
<P>
In the semi-finals on Saturday, Tanasugarn will challenge
defending champion Seles, who breezed past Julie Halard-Decugis

</P>
<P>

row.

<P>
The top-seeded Spaniard, who won the 1994 edition here, will
play the other semifinal against the winner between Anke Huber of
Germany and Olga Barabanschikova of Belarus.

<P>
DHAKA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The International Financial
Corporation (IFC), the private sector window of the World Bank,
has provided 227.32 million U.S. dollars to 16 private projects in
Bangladesh since 1996, the newspaper The Daily Star reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The IFC is quite open for more projects, mainly in power, gas
exploration and telecommunications and port development in the
country, Rashad Kaldany, the visiting IFC director for South and
Southeast Asia, was quoted as saying here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 110-megawatt barge-mounted power plant with a total cost of
103 million dollars is one of the major IFC's projects in
Bangladesh, which started operation in the southwestern city of
Khulna on September 12.
</P>
<P>
The 45 million-dollar Lafarge Surma Cement Limited and 22.5
million-dollar Grameen (countryside) Phone are the other two major
IFC-assisted projects in the country.
</P>
<P>
The IFC investment has increased significantly every year since
1996, placing Bangladesh among the nine countries in which IFC's
investment approval exceeded 100 million dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The IFC investment in Bangladesh was 15 million dollars in
1996, 45 million dollars in 1997 and 103 million dollars this
year, Kaldany stated.
</P>
<P>
"We're optimistic of development in Bangladesh in the
foreseeable future," the IFC director stated. "We are looking for
investment and we would be keen to support export-oriented
industries."
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that bureaucracy existing in Bangladesh
sometimes delayed getting the IFC-assisted projects moving. He
hoped to work with the government to overcome the problems.

game to break again for a 3-2 lead and sealed the first set in 43
minutes with a string of ground strokes.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Street Kids: Chronic Problem for Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
made much effort to save the country's tens of thousands of street
children and their families in recent years. However, street
children remain a daunting issue besetting the government.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF), the
government has taken a series of measures to change the fate of
the large number of street children in the country since the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the government launched a major campaign to
rid Manila of street children by the year 2000 as the first step
to eliminating this fixture from the country's street.
</P>
<P>
Under the campaign, the government is trying to provide these
kids in the capital region with proper education, livelihood
opportunities and capability-building assistance.
</P>
<P>
In the latest effort to help them, President Joseph Estrada
last week ordered the Department of Social Welfare and Development
to help in the resettlement and rehabilitation of about 75,000
street children in Metro Manila alone.
</P>
<P>
Describing the plight of street children as "a deep social
wound." Estrada called on the government and the private sector to
pay serious attention to this protracted social problem.
</P>
<P>
All these efforts have been successful to a certain degree.
Over the last seven years, nearly 90,000 street children have been
put into schools, according to a report from the Department of
Social Welfare and Development.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, dozens of street children centers have been
established in major cities in the country and a network composed
of government and non-government organizations has already been
set up in the country to deal with the street children issue.
</P>
<P>
But social workers said the country still has a long way to go
to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
According to the estimate of the social welfare department,
there are 250,000 street children in the country's major cities,
comprising about 2 percent of the country's child population. But
social workers believed their actual number may have already reach
half a million.
</P>
<P>
The country's street children phenomenon emerged as a serious
problem in the 1970s when thousands of families were forced to
flee from the rural areas to the cities to escape from the
insurgencies of some anti-government forces and the rising poverty
caused by these insurgencies.
</P>
<P>
Their arrival in the cities also marked the emergence of the
squatter phenomenon, especially in cities like Manila, Cebu in the
south and Baguio in the north.
</P>
<P>
By the 1980s, some 17 million or about a third of the country's
population were residing in the cities, most of them settling in
slums as they sought jobs and ways to survive.
</P>
<P>
From the group emerged the so-called street children who must
fend for themselves or help their families make a living. Braving
the snarl of traffic, they sell newspapers, flowers and candy, or
simply beg for their bread on the streets.
</P>
<P>
According to a study conducted by the social welfare
department, 75 percent of the street children have regular contact
with their families, 20-25 percent have families but contact is
irregular and 5 percent are those who have been completely
abandoned by their families.
</P>
<P>
A lot of social problems have arisen from the large number of
street children, the study said.
</P>
<P>
These children are easy targets to sexual abuse, prostitution,
drug abuse, street violence and criminal syndicates. Many of them
end up in orphanages, jails, sex dens and sweat shops.
</P>
<P>
Social welfare organizations, both government and
non-government, mostly the latter, have tried to cope with the
problem but with little success.
</P>
<P>
"The reason (for this) as always is the lack of money," said
Nelly Miranda, director of the National Project on Street Children
(NPSC), an organization created by the government in 1987 to
protect street kids.
</P>
<P>
Miranda said she couldn't believe her ears when she was told
the NPSC received a funding of only 4 million pesos (about 100,000
U.S. dollars) a year, part of it coming from the UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
With such a meager budget, she said, it is difficult for the
group to extend their help, such as education, training and health
service, to so many street children.
</P>
<P>
According to Miranda, only five cities in the country included
the street children problem in their development plans.
</P>
<P>
Miranda called on local governments and various quarters of the
country, especially the private sector, to take their share of
responsibility for the street children.
</P>
<P>
She also urged the government to increase budget for social
service and continue its efforts to ease poverty, a main cause for
the rising number of street children in the country.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Partly Privatize National Flag Carrier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government will
partially privatize the national flag carrier, Biman, by selling
its shares to an international airline and its employees
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The process of floating 49 percent of the shares of Biman is
now under way and preparations are also going on to strike a deal
between the management and the new financial partner, Civil
Aviation and Tourism Minister Mosharraf Hossain said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Forty percent of the shares will be sold to a reputed
international airline while the rest 9 percent will be sold to its
own employees," he said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has extended its support for finalizing this
process and agreed to provide 2 million U.S. dollars, said the
minister, who is also chairman of the board of directors of Biman.
</P>
<P>
Biman would also undergo overhauling in a bid to make it a
commercially profitable organization, he added.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Biman fleet includes four DC 10-30s, two
Airbuses, one F-28s and two ATPs. With an asset of 15.87 billion
taka (about 337.7 million dollars), Biman has a loan burden of
11.56 billion taka (about 267 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Meet Separately with Netanyahu, Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton will meet separately with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat next week,
seeking to break the deadlock in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement, the White House said Thursday that
Clinton would meet Netanyahu at the White House on Monday morning
and would hold talks with Arafat later in the week.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials played down expectations for the White House
meetings, saying no overall accord will emerge from the
discussions.
</P>
<P>
"We're at a point where the president's intervention can help
narrow the gaps," said a U.S. official.
</P>
<P>
"I don't expect a resolution of this next week. I think there
will be further work that we need to do."
</P>
<P>
The official told reporters at the White House that there were
no plans for a three-way meeting between Clinton, Netanyahu and
Arafat. "These are separate meetings. There are no plans for a
trilateral," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the United Nations headquarters in New York, U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright, who met Netanyahu on Wednesday, was
to meet the Israeli prime minister again and Arafat separately on
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Albright told reporters that the U.S. wanted concrete results
from its current diplomatic push, but she too was cautious about
predicting progress.
</P>
<P>
"We will try to lock in whatever we have agreed upon and I
can't predict that at this point because we are in the middle of
having these discussions," she said.

<HEADLINE> Albanian Ruling Party Agrees to Cabinet Reshuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian ruling Socialist
Party gave Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano a vote of confidence
on Thursday and agreed to Cabinet changes after consultations with
four other parties in the ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet reshuffle is the fifth since the government took
office in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the party's Steering Council, Nano asked his
party members to approve the vote of confidence and reconfirmed
his premiership so that he could consult with other parties, the
president and the parliament about the reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
He insisted Cabinet changes be made within the coalition. He
said that to hold earlier general elections and make concessions
under pressure were harmful for the country and not the way to
establish a government.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties are exerting pressure on the government and
demanding Nano and his cabinet resign.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister reaffirmed that his government would take a
series of measures to stablize public order and the economic
situation in Albania, to fight against corruption, and to approve
the new constitution on schedule.
</P>
<P>
Nano told reporters after the meeting that Cabinet changes
would be based on suggestions made by the European Union, the EU
Commission and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
The three organizations criticized the Albanian government
claiming that it was dilatory in implementing the administrative
program and did not forcefully crack down on organized crime,
smuggling and corruption.

<HEADLINE> Fermilab's Main Injector Accelerator Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- With the last four bolts
on the final 20-ton dipole magnet tightened Thursday, the new
"main injector accelerator" in the U.S. Fermi National Accelerator
Laboratory was officially launched by Federal Secretary of Energy
Bill Richardson at Batavia, 30 miles west of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launching ceremony, Richardson said that
Fermilab's new main injector will open up extraordinary new
opportunities for discovery in this basic field of research, not
only for scientists in the United States but also for the
international physics community.
</P>
<P>
The final dipole magnet is one of the 432 magnets installed in
the new main injector accelerator. The magnets, each measuring 30
feet long, are connected in a two-mile underground ring.
</P>
<P>
The new accelerator will inject high-energy protons into
Fermilab's Tevatron accelerator, more than tripling the scientific
capability of the world's most powerful particle accelerator.
</P>
<P>
Creating trillions of high-energy collisions between subatomic
particles moving at nearly light speed, the Tevatron allows
scientists from across the U.S. and around the world to study the
structure of matter at the smallest scale ever observed by human
beings.
</P>
<P>
Fermilab's Tevatron, four miles in circumference, is one of
only a handful of particle accelerators in the U.S., Europe and
Japan. The main injector accelerator will begin operating early
next year.

<HEADLINE> India's Steel Industry Faces Difficulty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Credit Rating
Information Services of India Ltd. (CRISIL) has predicted a bad
scenario in the short term for Indian steel manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Influenced by lower prices in the Asian region, the current
fiscal 1998-99 would be another difficult year for the Indian
steel industry, CRISIL sources said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
CRISIL anticipates further weakening of Indian steel
manufacturers' credit quality during the current year. The Indian
steel scenario may be further impacted by the lackluster growth
rate in domestic consumption, significantly lower than anticipated
off-take from infrastructure projects and progressively eroding
cost competitiveness in the wake of the regional financial
climate.
</P>
<P>
The woes of the country's steel industry are worsened as a
result of hikes in the prices of petroleum products and railway
freight besides regular increase in power tariffs. Besides, the
debt level of the industry is fairly high in view of the pressures
on volumes and realizations, which could aggravate further.
Outstanding ratings in the industry would also come under
increased pressure.
</P>
<P>
The Indian steel companies on the one hand are facing
substantial anti-dumping duties on their products in the
international markets and on the other hand they are required to
compete with cheaper imports in the domestic market.

<HEADLINE> Wage Reform Revitalizing State-owned Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Major cities in northeast
China's Liaoning Province are reforming the existing wage system
of industrial firms in a bid to raise efficiency and bring all
money-losing enterprises out of red in three years.
</P>
<P>
Provincial statistics show that 25 key state-owned firms in six
major cities in Liaoning, which has a concentration of one-tenth
of China's large and medium-sized state enterprises, have been
chosen for a pilot program to install a yearly salary system,
which will link the earnings of managers, technicians and workers
to the performance of their firms.
</P>
<P>
Under the new wage system, the government signed contracts with
factory managers and provided them with high annual salaries
ranging from 21,200 to 126,847 yuan, eight or ten times that of a
worker's annual income.
</P>
<P>
Managers' salaries are now connected to the growth of
enterprise net assets, profits earned, and taxes paid to the
state.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the income of technicians will be based on
the number and the quality of projects they have contracted, and
salesmens' salaries will be linked to their sales.
</P>
<P>
Vice Provincial Governor Chen Zhenggao said this is a
breakthrough in the distribution system at state-owned industrial
firms in China, though it is common practice at privately and
collectively owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the reform is to tap the enormous potential of
managers and workers in state-owned enterprises and boost their
economic results, he added.
</P>
<P>
For decades, directors and workers of state-owned enterprises
all received their salaries regardless of profit or loss at their
work units.
</P>
<P>
Economic reform now grants greater power to factory directors
who bear the sole responsibility for their profits and
losses.
</P>
<P>
However, up to now, their salaries did not fluctuate in line
with the performance of their enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Chen said: "That practice hardly aroused the spontaneous
enthusiasm of managers and workers."
</P>
<P>
According to a recent survey conducted by the provincial
economic and trade commission, 14 of the 25 enterprises practicing
the new wage system raised their sales value by 13 percent last
year. Their pre-tax profits soared 17.1 percent and workers'
incomes also rose considerably.
</P>
<P>
Over 95 percent of enterprise managers and 67 percent of
workers approve of the new wage system.
</P>
<P>
A female worker at the Shenyang Aluminium Factory said: "I
don't care how much the director earns. So long as he runs the
factory well, we can all earn more too."
</P>
<P>
This reform will be spread to more cities in Liaoning and other
provinces in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Chen said two principles should be followed in reforming the
wage system: one is to concentrate on market demand and
efficiency, and the other is to make sure all occupations work out
measures suitable to their individual conditions.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Guerrilla Group Proposes Prisoner Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian
National Liberation Army (ELN) has proposed to the government an
exchange of 20 policemen they have held captive since September 12
with jailed guerrillas, the El Tiempo newspaper said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The officers were seized in a guerrilla attack on the barracks
in the village of Las Mercedes in the northeast of the country.
ELN second-in-command Antonio Garcia said they were in good health.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to negotiate an exchange for some of the hundreds
of political prisoners," Garcia was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that the ELN, the second biggest guerrilla group in the
country, was ready to listen to government proposals about a
prisoner exchange -- the first such offer by the guerrilla
organization.
</P>
<P>
The country's largest guerrilla force -- the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia, which has captured more than 250
military personnel and policemen since last December, has insisted
on exchanging them with jailed guerrillas one by one.
</P>
<P>
The government established a special commission on Wednesday to
tackle the issue, the report said.

BELGRADE, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav president Slobodan

nothing but sharpen the conflict between Serbian security forces
and ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo.

Milosevic said after talks with UN High Commissioner for

was only one part of the anti-Yugoslavia movement, the Tanjug

Milosevic agreed to do whatever was possible to provide more

<HEADLINE> Tokyo, Seoul Reach Basic Accord on Fisheries Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Japan and South Korea reached a
basic accord early Friday morning on a new fisheries pact after
making concessions on disputed boundaries of a provisional fishing
zone and fishing catches, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The basic agreement was reached at a meeting between Japanese
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries
Minister Shoichi Nakagawa and South Korean Maritime Affairs and
Fisheries Minister Kim Sun Gil, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the two countries will draw a line between
their provisional fishing zones at a point halfway between the
lines they had insisted on.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, the two countries will establish the fishing zone
around a disputed group of islets in the Sea of Japan, called
Takeshima in Japan and Tokto in South Korea, 35 nautical miles
from the shores of the two countries, with a demarcation line at
135 degrees 30 minutes east, government sources said.
</P>
<P>
The delineation of the provisional fishing zone, where the two
countries will jointly control fishing operations, has been one of
the most contentious issues surrounding the pact because Tokyo and
Seoul have long been at odds over ownership of the disputed islets.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also agreed to limit their fishing catches in
each other's economic waters to the same specified amount in three
to five years.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Japan and South Korea have sought to conclude
a new fisheries pact in line with a U.N. convention allowing
countries to set 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zones around
their shores.
</P>
<P>
But negotiations between them collapsed in January after Japan
terminated a bilateral 1965 fisheries pact. The talks resumed in
April.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have expressed their intentions to conclude a
new fisheries pact before South Korean President Kim Dae Jung
arrives in Tokyo on October 7 for a four-day visit.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar, Singapore to Discuss Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- A Myanmar-Singapore Joint
Ministerial Working Committee (JMWC) will meet in Yangon later
this year for the third time to promote the two countries'
economic cooperation, trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
Singapore has been rendering assistance to Myanmar for the
development of its hotel and tourism industry, agricultural
production, livestock and fisheries, human resources development,
commerce, transport, communications and science and technology.
</P>
<P>
The JMWC was formed after an agreement on bilateral economic
cooperation was concluded when Chairman of the Myanmar State Peace
 and Development Council Senior General Than Shwe visited
Singapore in June 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Singapore's investment in
Myanmar amounted to 1.35 billion U.S. dollars in 66 projects at
the end of June this year, ranking first among 23 countries and
regions which have a total investment of 6.8 billion dollars in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also show that the two countries' bilateral
trade stood at 833.7 million dollars in the 1997-98 fiscal year
which ended in March, up from 633 million dollars in the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
Singapore exported to Myanmar 716.5 million dollars worth of
goods, while importing 117.2 million dollars of commodities from
Myanmar during the period.

<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria and India signed a
trade agreement here on Thursday that would foster a new range of
food products and reinvigorate Bulgaria's struggling industrial
sector.
</P>
<P>
The protocol of cooperation between the two countries would
also allow Indian companies to invest in Bulgaria and take
advantage of its duty-free access to the markets of the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
The agreement would help Indian firms to take advantage of the
Central European Free Trade Association, covering Poland, the
Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Romania and Bulgaria,
and the European Free Trade Association, which includes Iceland,
Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein.
</P>
<P>
The one-year agreement, covering agriculture, industry, energy
production and transport, was signed by Indian State Minister for
Agriculture Som Pal and Bulgarian Trade and Tourism Minister
Valentin Vasilev on Thursday at the 12th session of the Mixed
Committee for Economic and Scientific-Technical Cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Italian Prime Minister on Debt, Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi said Thursday that Italy has no alternative to cutting the
pubic debt from 118 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) to 100
percent within six years and curbing budget deficits to 1.2
percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
As a government spokesman affirmed that a political crisis
would jeopardize a promise of tax rebates at the end of the year,
Prodi said the deficit and debt goals "are absolutely binding on
our country and thus represent a limit and a condition placed on
our public financing choices".
</P>
<P>
With the cabinet preparing to make the 1999 budget bill public
on Friday, the prospect that the ruling center-left coalition
could stumble and fall loomed larger after Prodi failed to win
Communist Refoundation Party backing for the bill, essential for
passing it into law in the Lower House.
</P>
<P>
In his statement on Thursday, the prime minister seemed to be
addressing the Communist Refoundation Party's demands for
expanding spending to combat unemployment and bolster benefits for
the poor and other less-privileged groups.
</P>
<P>
He said European economic and monetary union required all
member states to look closely at their resources and find the best
way to dovetail public accounts and commitments to the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of municipal, provincial and regional
representatives, Prodi promised government efforts to ease
indebtedness at these levels and reiterated his intention to apply
a "sharp and very precise choice" in pursuing the reform of the
pubic sector.
</P>
<P>
On the road to European economic and monetary union Italy has
embarked on, Prodi said: "We knew we would have to remain loyal to
difficult pacts and respect very incisive parameters. And we knew
from the beginning that to do this wee needed the cooperation of
the entire country ... and of our complex system of local
governments."
</P>
<P>
Prodi went on to say that his government was not aiming at
development dictated from the top but at "flexible development
capable of being adapted to different conditions and to the
exploitation of all potentialities".
</P>
<P>
This development, he continued, needed cooperation at all
levels and the help of the trade unions and business and industry
organizations as well.
</P>
<P>
On Prodi's remarks on the public debt and budget deficits, a
communique issued by his office pointed out that the government's
three-year economic and financial guidelines had set the goal of a
deficit-GDP ratio of two percent for 1999, compared to 2.6 percent
for the present year.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines also chart a course for reducing the public debt
as a percentage of GDP per year from 1998 to 2001.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, the prime minister's spokesman, Ricardo
Franco Levi said plans for returning to taxpayers 60 percent of
the once-off euro-tax levied last year would be endangered by a
government crisis.
</P>
<P>
Levi said the problem of adding the rebate to December wage
packets was "very simple" in that if the government falls and the
budget is not passed into law, "the provisional administration
cannot contain any of the measures written into the budget".
</P>
<P>
"So there would be no coverage for repaying the euro-tax or
even for the measures on unemployment and the less-privileged
sector," he added.
</P>
<P>
The budget bill sets aside three trillion lire (1.76 billion
U.S. dollars) for reimbursing 60 percent of the special tax
applied to ensure that Italy's 1997 deficit as a ratio of GDP
would qualify the country for entry to the European single
currency this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Thursday called for "urgent" reform of the global financial system
to ensure the free movement of capital and market stability.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to France's Group of Seven partners, Chirac said
the industrialized nations should "draw lessons" from the Asian
and Russian crises and take action to maintain international
monetary stability.
</P>
<P>
But the free movement of capital must be under effective
supervision of the financial institutions in the countries
concerned, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said the role of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
should not be "weakened" and the way to make the institution more
effective was to transform the key policy-making interim committee
into a body with the power to make decisions.

<HEADLINE> Courier to Sit as U.S. Faces Italy in Davis Cup Semis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Jim Courier will be
nothing more than a lucky charm this weekend when the United
States faces Italy in the best-of-five Davis Cup semifinals.
</P>
<P>
Courier, the hero of the American's opening-round victory over
Russia, failed to make his way into captain Tom Gullikson's
lineup. He withdrew from last month's U.S. Open due to a "dead
arm" and was reportedly considering retirement earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Courier's inactivity and lack of match preparation ultimately
led to Gullikson's decision to go with Davis Cup rookie
Jan-Michael Gambill and Davis Cup veteran Todd Martin in singles.
</P>
<P>
"He hasn't had much match competition in quite a while," said
Gullikson. "It was basically that issue of match toughness for
sure."
</P>
<P>
Gambill will face Italy's Andrea Gaudenzi in the opening
singles match and Martin will follow against Davide Sanguinetti
on Friday at Milwaukee Arena. Martin and Justin Gimelstob will
team in doubles against Gaudenzi and Diego Nargiso on Saturday.
The reverse singles will be held Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Sweden, which defeated the U.S. in last
year's final, will host Spain in the other semifinal in Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
Courier was a surprise selection when the U.S. team was
announced two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has won seven of nine meetings with Italy in Davis
Cup competition. In the last meeting, the U.S. swept Italy 5-0
in the quarterfinals.

<HEADLINE> NBA Cancels Camps, Preseason Games Through Oct 16 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- With no plans for a
collective bargaining session in the near future, the NBA today
concelled training camps and 24 preseason games through October
16.
</P>
<P>
The NBA, which imposed a lockout on its players in July, cited
the stalled negotiations as the reasons for the cancellations.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, it is now clear there will not be enough time
for teams to fill their rosters, go through a necessary period of
conditioning, and be ready to play preseason games by mid-Oc
tober," said NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik.
</P>
<P>
NBA commissioner David Stern and Granik met with Players
Association executive director Billy Hunter and union president
Patrick Ewing for a brief session on Wednesday. It marked the
first time since August 6 that discussions were held. But both
sides refused to divulge the content of the meeting and no future
session was scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The cancellation comes on the heels of the league postponing
its referee trianing camp and rookie transition program. The
regeree training camp was scheduled to begin September 25, while
the rookie transition program was set for September 20-23.
</P>
<P>
The sides currently are awaiting a grievance ruling from
arbitrator John Feerick. The NBA Player Association filed a
salary grievance hours before the owners imposed a lockout on
July 1.

Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Each province, autonomous region, and municipality should make
efforts to ensure that the amount of arable land under its
jurisdiction does not decrease. Farmland under special protection
should account for more than 80 percent of the total, according to
the law.
</P>
<P>
China is rich in land resources, but weak in per capital
availability of land resources, especially arable land
resources. The country has 22 percent of the world's population,
but less than ten percent of the world's arable land.
</P>
<P>
According to the new law, land is divided into farmland, land
for construction, and unutilized land, and land use should be in
line with its proper category.
</P>
<P>
Land for construction should be under strict control, and
compensation for land acquisition will be raised, the law says.
</P>
<P>
The right to approve land use will be given back to the central
and provincial governments, according to the new law.
</P>
<P>
The new land-use law also strengthens law-enforcement
supervision and calls for deepened land-use reform.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said the new land-use law is an overall adjustment of the
existing one, not just a few amendments to the articles, and
signals a major transfer in the use and management of land.
</P>
<P>
The existing Land-Use Law, which took effect a decade ago, has
played its role in developing and utilizing land resources and
protecting arable land, but it cannot resolve the knotty problems
which have appeared on the way to a socialist market economy, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Democratic Activists Voice Support for Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Democratic party activists
from across the United States on Thursday accused Republicans of
running a "patently unfair" impeachment process against President
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Opening a three-day meeting of the Democratic National
Committee (DNC), party members debated over a resolution
supporting the president, which won tentative approval.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, approved unanimously by a committee for
consideration in Saturday's full membership meeting, commends
Clinton for taking responsibility for his actions and acknowledges
the "sincerity of his apology."
</P>
<P>
It also blasts prosecutor Kenneth Starr's investigation for
"lasting longer than the Civil War" and costing more than 40
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The resolution says the president has done a good job "despite
patently unfair proceedings" in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
Clinton played host to DNC members at a White House reception
Thursday night.

<HEADLINE> Factory Head Fined For Embezzlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The head of a factory in
east China's Zhejiang Province must pay fines of 2.38 million yuan
(about 287,000 U.S. Dollars) for embezzling public property and
poor performance on duty.
</P>
<P>
In late 1991, Yi Lihua was the head of a collectively run
chemical fiber plant in the city of Shaoxing. During his tenure he
obtained materials and products and sold them to relatives and
friends at very low prices, sometimes even below cost.
</P>
<P>
Under his leadership, the factory borrowed funds from persons
and other enterprises at unreasonable high interest rates which
drove the factory to the edge of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
Local media disclosed that Yi took more than 430,000 yuan from
the factory in the name of bonuses and built luxurious villas in
his hometown.
</P>
<P>
Yi is the first factory head in the province to be fined for
such activities. Local officials explained that the amount of the
fine was worked out in accordance with relevant laws and
regulations.

<HEADLINE> ADB Loan For Sri Lanka's Urban Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) has approved a loan of 70 million U.S. dollars for Sri Lanka
to improve urban infrastructure and finance housing improvement
for low income households, the ADB office here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The project will also give local authorities more
responsibility for providing and financing infrastructure and
municipal services.
</P>
<P>
Deficiencies in basic infrastructure has restrained urban areas
from playing a more active role in the economy's growth, the ADB
noted in a release noted.
</P>
<P>
Most secondary towns have piped water supply but up to 40
percent of water is lost through poor construction and lack of
maintenance. Inadequate drainage systems lead to flooding during
the monsoon. Roads are of poor quality and ill-maintained.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the project is 100 million dollars. The ADB
loan will come from its Special Funds resources, which are
interest-free and repayable over 40 years.
</P>
<P>
The project will improve roads, water supply and drainage
systems, bus terminals and public markets in 27 secondary towns in
Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Another part of the project will support efforts between local
authorities and private land owners to develop unplanned and
unserviced urban land, the release said.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Panama Disagree on U.S. Military Presense in Panama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States and
Panama announced Thursday night that they failed to reach an
agreement on permitting American troops to remain in Panama beyond
the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
"Despite extensive efforts by both countries, and many areas of
common interest, an accord on the establishment of a MCC
(multinational counter-narcotics center) in Panama was not
attainable," the two countries said in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
The announcement means that for the first time since 1903, when
Panama became independent with help from the U.S., no U.S. troops
will be based in Panama.
</P>
<P>
The Panama Canal treaties require the departure of American
soldiers by December 31, 1999, when control over the waterway
reverts to Panama.
</P>
<P>
Since 1997, the two countries have sought agreement on
establishing the MCC in which military personnel from the U.S. and
many hemispheric countries would take part.
</P>
<P>
The counter-narcotics center would permit the U.S. to continue
anti-drug operations close to the major sources of cocaine
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations failed because the U.S. Defense Department
insisted that American troops be allowed to carry out a range of
activities outside the framework of the counter-narcotics center,
including search and rescue operations, training flights,
humanitarian relief and logistical support activities.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials argued it would not have been cost-effective for
the U.S. to maintain the anti-drug center if it were barred from
carrying out these functions.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanians, however, said that such activities would give
the appearance of an American military base in disguise.

<HEADLINE> Feminists Urge Congress to Stop Efforts to Impeach Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Feminist leaders in the
United States Thursday called on the nation's women to demand that
the Republican-controlled Congress drop efforts to impeach
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"Some of those leading the charge against Clinton are among the
worst foes of women's rights," a joint statement from several
organizations said. "The opponents of the president have a
political agenda that will harm women long after the scandal has
faded from the front pages."
</P>
<P>
"Women should write, call, telefax, e-mail, shout and tell
Congress, `Do not impeach this president and don't force him to
resign,'" said Yvonne Scruggs-Leftwich, head of the Black
Leadership Forum Inc.
</P>
<P>
Among others making similar demands were feminist pioneer Betty
Friedan; Patricia Ireland, president of the National Organization
for Women; and Eleanor Smeal, president of the Feminist Majority.
</P>
<P>
They said the accusations against the president do not rise to
the level of impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Ireland said that Republicans "are mired
in a partisan game of chicken" and "seem determined not to stop
until this government crashes."
</P>
<P>
Smeal, while asserting that all women believe Clinton has much
to answer for in his admitted sexual relationship with Monica
Lewinsky, said that even if he lied about that relationship, he
did not commit an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
"We deplore his misconduct but we also understand the hypocrisy
of his opponents," she said. "We have years of progress at stake
if the president is hounded out of office. But worse yet, we risk
the ushering into power of a puritanical or fundamentalist sex
police which speaks of freedom but allows government to destroy
the rights of privacy."
</P>
<P>
But the feminists' position drew a quick negative reaction from
Carmen Pate, head of Concerned Women for America, a conservative
public policy group, which is meeting this weekend in Alexandria,
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
"We wholeheartedly disagree with them," she said. "We believe
the choices the president has made deserve consequences. We
believe he is guilty of perjury and obstruction of justice. At
this point, we just need to concentrate on removing the president
from office."
</P>
<P>
Polls taken in recent days show women remain slightly more
inclined than men to support Clinton, and women are less likely
than men to support impeachment if it were proved the president
lied under oath.

<HEADLINE> May Riots Instigated by Groups: Jakarta Officer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Jakarta Military Command
chief of staff Sudi Silalahi Thursday confirmed that the May riots
were apparently instigated by groups of people in an organized
manner but did not identify the mastermind, the Jakarta Post
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sudi was questioned by the government-sponsored Joint
Fact-Finding Team investigating the riots on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sudi was the seventh active or former government official the
team had examined.
</P>
<P>
Bambang W. Suharto, one of the team's members, told reporters
that the team believed that an organized group had provoked the
May riots in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
He quoted Sudi and police sources as saying security
authorities are searching for the provocateurs' whereabouts and
dealing with some of them.
</P>
<P>
He said he is waiting for the result of the investigation into
the organized group.
</P>
<P>
The government established the Joint Fact-Finding Team in July
to investigate reports that the May 13-15 riots were masterminded.
More than 1,200 people were killed and thousands of buildings and
vehicles damaged during the riots in Jakarta and other cities.
</P>
<P>
Activists have said 168 women and children were raped or
sexually assaulted during the riots and 20 of whom died or
committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
Easter Indahyani Jusuf Lubis, chairwoman of Solidaritas Nusa
Bangsa, a non-governmental organization, claimed on Thursday that
it had hard evidence that sexual assaults and rapes did occur
during the riots.
</P>
<P>
She told a seminar that the organization had met with a doctor
who treated seven victims of sexual assaults during the riots. The
doctor had secured their medical records, including pictures of
mutilated genitals.
</P>
<P>
A source close to the organization told the Jakarta Post that
it intended to report the evidence to the rights body on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Georges Sweeps Across Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Hurricane "Georges" continued
its stormy route across the Caribbean on Thursday as it swept
across Cuba's eastern provinces of Guantanamo and Holguin, with no
reports of casualties.
</P>
<P>
The Meteorology Institute of Cuba said the hurricane's eye was
in Cuchillas de Toa, Guantanamo, some 650 miles east of Havana, at
21:00 local time on Thursday (0100 GMT Friday).
</P>
<P>
Chief meteorologist Jose Rubiera said Georges' center was 31
miles in diameter with a zone of calm in its eye, where there is
not a single drop of rain.
</P>
<P>
Outside the eye, however, heavy rains lashed down on towns and
villages as the hurricane moved west-northwest over Guantanamo and
Holguin at 13.75 miles per hour (mph), down from 73.75 mph when it
first entered Cuba.
</P>
<P>
According to forecasts, Georges will reach Camaguey and Ciego
de Avila in eastern Cuba and the central province of Sancti
Spiritus by early Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Under an emergency measure of the Cuban National Civil Defense,
more than 20,000 residents have been evacuated as well as some
1,000 foreign tourists vacationing in areas along the hurricane's
route.

<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Football
Association (CFA) suggested their 2000 Olympics preliminary round
rivals to change the home-and-away matches to the double
round-robin formation, CFA officials said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
CFA has sent letters to its counterparts of Group 7, which
brackets Vietnam, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and
Myanmar, saying China is willing to host one of the double round
if other FAs agree the suggestion.
</P>
<P>
It will be a big cost financially and physically, and give
lots of troubles to the domestic leagues, if the matches are to
be played on the home-any-away basis, CFA advised in the letters.
</P>
<P>
Besides, China also proposed to play the matches in May and
June, shortening the period from four months to two. The matches
were originally scheduled to start in February.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Football Confederation has no fixed rules indicating
how to play the preliminary round matches.
</P>
<P>
No responses have been received yet by now.

<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The cities of Beijing and
Tianjin will undertake massive highway building projects to
alleviate growing traffic jams and keep pace with rapid economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Beijing, China's capital, will spend 20 billion yuan (about 2.4
billion US dollars) to build 1,236 kilometers of new roads over
the next five years to raise the city's highway density to 0.87
kilometers per square kilometer.
</P>
<P>
Most of this money will be used to build 10 key projects
including an expressway between Beijing and Shenyang, capital of
northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
Other projects include three ring-roads connecting the capital
with 10 satellite cities and an expressway linking Beijing with
Kaifeng in central China's Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, Beijing had 12,209 kilometers of highway,
the most in China. The city plans to bring the highway network to
13,542 kilometers by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>

ROME, September 24 (Xinhua) -- A Libyan gunship rammed and
fired on an Italian fishing boat 30 nautical miles off the Libyan
coast Thursday morning, killing a Sicilian fisherman.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Armed Forces Asked to Secure Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie Thursday ordered all members of the Armed Forces (ABRI) to
secure the political reform agenda, national newspapers reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I issue this instruction because there have been signs lately
of certain quarters who are not willing to see the reform agenda
to be implemented smoothly," the president said at a commander's
call ceremony here.
</P>
<P>
He accused certain groups, which he did not identify, of using
all possible means to foil the government's reform agenda,
including the general election and presidential election planned
respectively for May and December next year.
</P>
<P>
"Our campaign for reform is being marred by political actions
and activities which tend to put forward physical strength by
mobilizing crowds, either through demonstrations or other
activities which obstruct norms, rules and ethics," he said.
</P>
<P>
Students in Jakarta and other cities held rallies almost every
day this month to protest the spiraling prices for basic
commodities and urged President Habibie to take concrete measures
to solve the economic problems.
</P>
<P>
The president charged that the current wave of street protests
and demonstrations had gone too far and breached the limits of
tolerance.
</P>
<P>
"The looting and destruction done by irresponsible groups still
continue in several regions and are the factors that have slowed
economic recovery," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I ask all ranks of ABRI to act firmly against the looters and
rioters in accordance with standing procedures," he said.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's ceremony was the second meeting between the
president, who is the ABRI supreme commander, and the country's
top generals. The first meeting was held in June.
</P>
<P>
In a press release after the meeting, Wiranto appealed to all
parties to exercise self-restraint and stop any destructive act,
propaganda and instigation detrimental to the country's union and
cohesion.
</P>
<P>
The Armed Forces had come to a definite conclusion that all
forms of destructive action threatening peace and order as well as
the country's safety must be sternly dealt with, regardless of the
risks the country might face, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Haikou, capital of China's
island province of Hainan, has been spending 1.3 billion yuan
(about 157 million U.S. Dollars) on nine infrastructure projects
in urban areas since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
Work on a 667-million-yuan sea bridge began in April. The
2,663-meter bridge is expected to open to traffic in 2001, helping
relieve pressure from traffic jams in urban areas. The bridge is
being built with the help of 50 million U.S. Dollars in Japanese
loans.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 200 million yuan will be used for a 6.5-kilometer dike
to control flooding on a river that runs into the sea from the
east of Haikou.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 220 million yuan will be spent on a 3.1-kilometer
tidal barrage along the sea.
</P>
<P>
A 340-million-yuan sewage treatment plant is expected to be
built in June next year, with a daily handling capacity of 300,000
tons of waste water, putting Haikou in the lead in China in
disposing of waste water.
</P>
<P>
The second phase of construction work on waterworks is due to
be completed at the end of this year, supplying 240,000 tons of
water a day and mostly meeting the water supply demand in urban
areas.
</P>
<P>
Work is also going on for the improvement of the city's
electric power grid and transport network with state loans.

The 16-nation alliance issued an "activation warning,"saying
air forces would be required for "both the limited air option and
a phased air campaign in Kosovo."

<HEADLINE> NBA to Cancel Part of Preseason Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The NBA plans to cancel
at least some preseason games, Deputy Commissioner Russ Granik
said Thursday as the league's lockout and stalemate began its
13th week.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time in the league's five decades that
either a preseason game or a regular season game invloving two
NBA teams has been cancelled because of labor problems.
</P>
<P>
Sources throughout the league said yesterday that they
expected the NBA to decide to cancel the entire preseason by the
end of the week. While Granik did not rule out that possibility.
He said: "That would be extreme. We will only cancel things as
we absulutely have to."
</P>
<P>
Training camps are scheduled to open on October 6, and the
first preseason games are slated for October 13. An exhibition
game in Israel between the Miami Heat and Maccabi Tel Aviv, an
international club power, was cancelled earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Wizards are scheduled to begin their preseason
with home games on October 16 against the Boston Celtics in
Baltimore and on October 17 against the Philadelphia 76ers at MCI
center in Washington.
</P>
<P>
"I can't talk about that," Wozards General Manager Wes Unseld
said yesterdy. "As long as it's lockout issue, I can't talk about
it."
</P>
<P>
Granik said at least the first week of preseason games would
be cancelled today.
</P>
<P>
"There is no chance we can hope to be ready to play any
exhibition games in the first half of October, and we might as
well let our fans and promoters know that," Granik said.
</P>
<P>
With the regular season scheduled to open on November 3, it is
increasingly likely that it won't start on time. Negotiations
are stalled and Commissioner David Stern said before the lockout
that a month might be needed after an agreement for an
abbreviated free agency signing period and training camp before
games could begin.

<HEADLINE> FA Moves to Stamp out Sleaze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Football Association is
to appoint a trouble-shooter with wide-ranging powers to stamp
out sleaze within the English game.
</P>
<P>
The initiative is intended to crack down on the sort of
scandals which have dogged soccer over the past few years on and
off the field.
</P>
<P>
One of the most important areas for investigation will be club
finances, because of the hundreds of millions of pounds which
have poured into the national game since the birth of live
televised football.
</P>
<P>
The moves follow the recommendations of former Metropolitan
Police deputy commissioner Sir John Smith in his report into
football's finances and reputation in January.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came within hours of a soccer scout being
ordered to pay a total of 10,000 pounds by the FA following the
so-called 'bungs inquiry'.
</P>
<P>
Former Arsenal chief scout Steve Burtenshaw, now chief scout
at QPR, admitted misconduct last week at a hearing before an FA
commission in connection with the transfer of midfielder John J
ensen from Danish club Brondby to Arsenal in 1992.
</P>
<P>
He apologised at the hearing for having accepted 35,000 pounds
from agent Rune Hauge two months after Jensen arrived at Highbury
in the transfer deal which led to former Arsenal boss George
Graham's one-year ban from the game.
</P>
<P>
His legal team is considering an appeal, believing the fine of
7,500 and order to pay 2,500 costs are unduly severe.
</P>
<P>
The FA said it had already written to the Government making it
clear it endorsed Sir John's recommendations in principle, and
was committed to introduce them backed by the necessary financial
resources.
</P>
<P>
"Several hundred applicants are already being considered for a
new senior post to deal specifically with all disciplinary issues
which often require detailed investigation and prosecution," said
a Football Association spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"The successful candidate's task will cover offences as varied
as violent conduct, financial irregularities and racist abuse.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, the FA's new finance director is developing
specific proposals in consultation with the clubs that may lead
to the creation of a financial advisory department. This will
assist and advise clubs on financial matters," he said.

<P>
LONDON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United shrugged
off their Highbury trauma to score a goal in either half and wrap
up victory in a typically fierce clash against Liverpool in a
English Premier League match on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Denis Irwin lived up to his reputation as a penalty expert to
score from the spot after 19 minutes and Paul Scholes added a
sweet second 11 minutes from time to seal the points and take
them above Liverpool into third place.
</P>
<P>
United, humiliated 3-0 at Arsenal on Sunday, were desperate
for a win over their arch rivals to keep up with the early
Premiership pacesetters.
</P>
<P>
It was a frustrating night for Liverpool, following on from
their disappointing 3-3 home draw with Charlton. They dominated
long periods of the second half at Old Trafford but failed to
make the most of their possession.
</P>
<P>
Eight players - four from either side - were booked as tempers
frequently became frayed.

<HEADLINE> Graham Refuses to be Drawn into Spurs Speculation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Tottenham Hotspur said on
Thursday that Leeds United's George Graham had yet to agree to
become their new coach.
</P>
<P>
Graham himself refused to be drawn into the intense
speculation linking him with the vacant job at White Hart Lane
but many Leeds fans are resigned to losing him.
</P>
<P>
Tottenham, who play Leeds in the premier league at White Hart
Lane on Saturday, said in a statement: "It is true discussions
have been going on between the clubs but there is no truth in
reports he has already agreed to take charge."
</P>
<P>
Graham, 54, told Leeds United's Clubcall: "I am the manager of
Leeds United and we are going to Tottenham on Saturday looking
for three points. The rest is just a side issue."
</P>
<P>
Ray Fell, chairman of the Leeds Supporters' Club, said the
feeling among the fans was that "George was on his way".
</P>
<P>
"Fans are getting fed up with contracts meaning nothing in
football. It seems the only people with any loyalty are the fans."
</P>
<P>
Graham, a former player and manager of Tottenham's arch-rivals
Arsenal, would not, initially at least, be a popular choice among
Spurs fans.
</P>
<P>
The club have been without a manager since Christian Gross was
sacked on September 5.
</P>
<P>
Former manager David Pleat has been put in temporary charge of
the team who have won three, drawn one and lost one of the five
league and cup matches under his control.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Balanced Development Urged in Globalization  (by Gu Zhenqiu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Developing countries
from Africa, Asia and Latin America called for a balance of
development between North and South in the globalization process,
which is mainly characterized by strengthened interdependence
among members of the global family.
</P>
<P>
In their speeches to the general debate of the 53rd General
Assembly session, which entered the fourth day on Thursday,
leaders from the developing world voiced their concerns over the
negative effects brought about by globalization.
</P>
<P>
It is their consensus, though produced in a separate manner,
that no country can stand alone in today's world, and no nation
can be immune to the suffering of other nations. Developing
countries are especially in poorer position to greet the process
of globalization due to the existing unfair international
political and economic order.
</P>
<P>
The pros and cons of economic globalization has been better
perceived following the July 1997 outbreak of the financial crisis
in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Ripples have spread widely in the world from the economic
upheavals of Southeast Asia and Russia, and nearly every corner of
the global village has been affected, but only varying in degrees,
they said. Put starkly, the financial crisis threatened emerging
economies from Latin America to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Leonardo Santos Simao, foreign minister of Mozambique, said,
"The crisis which initially began as an isolated case in the Asian
economies has rapidly spread to virtually all continents. Its
consequences have demonstrated that no country in this globalized
economy is immune to the suffering of other nations."
</P>
<P>
"We cannot afford to leave vast segments of nations and peoples
unattended and still confronted with basic challenges, such as
famine, epidemic diseases, inadequate water distribution, among
others," he added.
</P>
<P>
His remarks were echoed by South African President Nelson
Mandela, who said that the eradication of poverty remains one of
the major tasks in the developing world under the current unfair
international economic order.
</P>
<P>
"We have a situation in which the further accumulation of
wealth, rather than contribution to the improvement of the quality
of life of all humanity, is generating poverty at a frightening
accelerated pace," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Bangladesh also reaches the same conclusion.
Foreign Minister Abdus Azad told the General Assembly that "the
process of globalization, and liberalization bring risks, grave
challenges as well as opportunities -- but in unequal ways."
</P>
<P>
"The external economic shocks associated with this process are
too powerful for the vulnerable economies to absorb," he said,
"This has now being recognized even by beneficiaries of
globalization."
</P>
<P>
Far away from Bangladesh, Venezuela also approaches to the
process of globalization from the same perspective. Delivering his
speech at the General Assembly, President Rafael Caldera said,
"This complex phenomenon that we have come to call globalization,
in addition to its positive aspects and the progress it entails,
can also have progressively negative effects for the emerging
developing countries."
</P>
<P>
An integral component of the globalization process, which takes
shape on the basis of technical advancement and rapid flow of
information, is unfettered movement of the factors of production,
including capital and labor.
</P>
<P>
Better perception of the problem, to a large extent, paves the
way for effective and workable solutions. The developing countries
not only raised questions at the U.N. forum, but also put forward
some proposals to solve the problems in the economic and financial
field.
</P>
<P>
A careful study can find that their proposals have one thing in
common. That is, they all cry out to have concerted international
efforts in seeking the relevant solutions.
</P>
<P>
"We need to formulate a positive and workable agenda for
ensuring that the globalization process promotes equality and
benefit for all," Azad said.
</P>
<P>
"The maladies that spring from economic globalization requires
remedies which are global in scope, remedies which must take
account of the ailments of all States, and not be based solely on
the prescriptions advanced by those who may seem to be secure,"
said the president of Sri Lanka, Chandrika Kumaratunga, in her
speech.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the developing countries, the least developed
countries in particular, are undertaking an uphill task to help
themselves out of pains in the wake of the globalization process.
</P>
<P>
But for one thing to be sure, the United Nations can also play
a role in coordinating global efforts to expand world economy
while keeping off negative effects of globalization.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has a more profound
conception. "Globalization will depend on the balance between rich
and poor, on the more advanced nations, the intermediately
advanced nations, and the least advanced nations, on the
application of equitable formulas to alleviate 'the external debt
burden'."

<HEADLINE> 2002 Winter Olympics Gets 1.4 Billion Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The organizing committee
of the 2002 Winter Olympics raised a proposed 1.4 billion US
dollars budget for the Games on Thursday at Salt Lake City, the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The organizers know the spending plan is based on the Salt
Lake Organizing Committee's best assumptions and estimates, and a
lot of unexpected things may happen in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
"We approved the proposal with the caveat that we will
aggressively monitor it," said lan Layton, chairman of the SLOC
board of trustees' budget committee. "We will make no commitments
that we don't have the money to pay for."
</P>
<P>
Layton said the full board will give a vote on October 8 on
his committee's recommendation.
</P>
<P>
Following Thursday's presentation, the proposed budget won
plaudits from members of the United States and International
Olympic committees who sit on SLOC's board.
</P>
<P>
"I'm pleased with the level of detail," said Anita DeFrantz,an
IOC vice president. "We are deeply concerned there is enough to
do the job and this looks like there will be."
</P>
<P>
The proposed spending plan must also be approved by the IOC.
It is more than 400 million dollars larger than the amount
Nagano, Japan, spent to host the Winter Games early this year.
But the Nagano budget didn't include nearly 500 million in
construction costs covered by the government.
</P>
<P>
The Salt Lake spending plan covers 41 functions, such as
medical services or security, 200-plus projects, like the torch
relay, 400 subprojects and 3,000 activities, such as tree plan
tings.

<P>
NEW YORK, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Stocks fell sharply Thursday
on Wall Street as investors preferred to lock in some profits from
Wednesday's big gains.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average finished 152.42 points lower
at 8,001.99. It nearly surrendered all of Wednesday's 257-point
surge with an afternoon slide of 218. Other major stock indicators
also suffered big losses.
</P>
<P>
The Dow has lost nearly 1,000 points in the quarter that ends
next Wednesday despite setting new highs as the three-month period
began in July. A rapid retreat from the July 17 peak of 9,337.97
has suddenly reduced this year's gain from 18.1 percent to just
1.2 percent, or less than 100 points.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the Dow rose to its highest level in a month as
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan signaled that the central
bank will lower interest rates to combat a widening economic
crisis overseas, though he did not give a clear timetable.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 23.37 to 1,042.72, and the
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 39.93 to 1,720.34.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by nearly a 2-to-1 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume totaled
952.04 million shares, down from a Wednesday's hefty tally of 1.063
billion.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index fell 10.36 to 516.59, and the American
Stock Exchange composite index fell 3.78 to 642.30.

<HEADLINE> Rushdie Says Odeal Seems to be Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Author Salman Rushdie on
Thursday reacted with relief to the news that Iran has dropped its
support for a bounty to be paid for his assassination.
</P>
<P>
"Well, it looks like it is over," Rushdie told Sky Television
outside the Foreign Office after a briefing from government
minister Derek Fatchett.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Iranian religious leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
pronounced a death sentence on Rushdie for his book The Satanic
Verses and forced him into hiding in Britain ever since.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook met his Iranian
counterpart, Kamal Kharrazi, at the United Nations in New York
earlier in the day and agreed to upgrade diplomatic ties between
the two countries after Kharrazi said Iran would not threaten
Rushdie's life or encourage anyone else to do so.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Kharrazi said his government "has no intention,
nor is it going to take any action whatsoever to threaten the life
of the author of The Satanic Verses...nor will it encourage or
assist anybody to do so."
</P>
<P>
He also said the Iranian government disassociated itself from
any reward that had been offered for the life of Rushdie. An
Iranian revolutionary foundation has placed a $2.5 million bounty
on Rushdie's head.
</P>
<P>
Rushdie said it appeared to him that the lifting of the death
sentence had broad support in Iran.
</P>
<P>
"It seems this has been done in Iran with consensus. There
doesn't seem to be any opposition to it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iran's decision to settle the Rushdie matter was followed by a
mutual agreement between Iran and Britain to upgrade diplomatic
relations.

<HEADLINE> UK Managers Complain of Heavy Workload </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- British managers at all levels
have cut back on their working week, citing the effect the long
hours culture was having on their personal lives, according to an
Institute of Management (IM) report on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Junior and middle managers were most against long hours, with
nearly 60 percent complaining that they worked long hours either
because it was expected by more senior management, or because they
had no choice.
</P>
<P>
Overall, 78 percent of managers worked more than 40 hours a
week, down from 82 percent last year, while 34 percent (from 38
percent) worked more than 50 hours, Reuters quoted IM as saying.
</P>
<P>
Some 72 percent said working hours affected their relationships
with their partner, with 73 percent saying it encroached on time
spent with their children. That said, 57 percent claimed work was
as important to them as home life.
</P>
<P>
Fewer admitted to working at weekends (34 percent from 41
percent) or during evenings (54 percent from 59 percent).
</P>
<P>
Company restructurings have become a way of life, with 62
percent of managers saying their organization had been reshaped in
the past year.
</P>
<P>
On the upside, these moves were seen by 51 percent as leading
to increased profitability. But restructuring also brought greater
job insecurity (65 percent), lower morale (64 percent), and
reduced motivation and loyalty (49 percent), Reuters said.
</P>
<P>
The results were taken from the second year of an ongoing study
involving 5,000 IM members, of whom 1,312 responded this time, IM
said.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Makes Largest New Loan Commitments in FY 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- In the fiscal year 1998,
ended on June 30, the World Bank made the largest new loan
commitments in its history, said the Bank in its annual report
released here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank's new loan commitments includes 21.1 billion
U.S. dollar loan from the International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development (IBRD), of which 5 billion dollars went to South
Korea and 7.5 billion dollars interest-free credits from the
International Development Association (IDA), up 62 percent over
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The IBRD/IDA combined disbursements in the year rose to 25.5
billion dollars, up from nearly 20 billion dollars in FY1997.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the World Bank focused on helping its
member countries manage the social consequences of the economic
and financial crisis by protecting and improving quality of social
services and public expenditures targeted to help the poor. This
included designing and financing social funds and strengthening
social security systems for the elderly and unemployed.
</P>
<P>
The Bank's lending priorities targeted education, health,
nutrition and population as well as the social sector, which
totaled 6.4 billion dollars, and 8.5 billion dollars when the
social protection components of other loans is included. This is
30 percent of total lending, a big increase over 1997 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank responded to the East Asia crisis by pledging
some 16 billion dollars, in addition to its regular lending
program. By the end of the year, 5.65 billion dollars had been
disbursed. A two-pronged, rapid and substantial lending program was
directed both at financial-and corporate-sector restructuring and
preserving social services.

<HEADLINE> European Stocks Drop with Renewed Fears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- European stocks dropped
Thursday with renewed fears that the financial crises in emerging
markets and the bailout of a major U.S. hedge fund would hurt
corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
An early bout of excitement at the prospect of a U.S. rate cut
went into reverse by mid-afternoon as Wall Street opened lower.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 had rallied to a 107 point gain, hitting a
high at 5322.3 in the opening minutes of trade as investors took
heart from the Dow's 257 point rally on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Markets around the world reacted positively to Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan's strongest hint yet that U.S. rates could
fall in response to the financial turmoil in international
markets.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Open Markets Committee meets next Tuesday to decide
on policy. U.S. interest rate futures predict a full 50 basis
point cut from 5.50 percent in Fed funds by the end of November.
</P>
<P>
But dealers said that the markets had over-reacted with the
strong rally, which left them open to a bout of of profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 ended down 47.1 at 5167.6 after dropping to a low
at 5158.6 as the Dow lost just over 50 points.
</P>
<P>
A 3.5 billion U.S. dollars bailout of U.S. hedge fund Long-Term
Capital, also worried investors.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares fell sharply, too, after a poor
performance in New York and after initial excitement about a
possible U.S. rate cut wore off. The Xetra Dax finished 111.62
points lower at 4611.34.
</P>
<P>
Dealers expected the market to remain quiet on Friday as people
were nervous going into the national election on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said an earlier indication of the market's fragile
intraday trading was its failure to match last-session gains made
by other major markets.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, shares followed the international trend as Wall
Street turned lower. The Cac 40 finished 42.65 points lower at
3381.13.
</P>
<P>
Some traders were said to be somewhat sceptical about the
possibility of a U.S. rate cut next week.
</P>
<P>
Investor interest was high because Thursday marks the first day
of the new liquidation on the Paris Bourse, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
Investors tend to be more amenable to placing big orders on the
first day of a new trading month after having settled a month's
worth of transactions and cleaned their books.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Welcomes Pakistan Nuclear Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton Thursday welcomed Pakistan's offer to sign a nuclear test
ban treaty and urged the U.S. Senate to ratify it.
</P>
<P>
"We're very pleased by the statement that the government of
Pakistan has now made with respect to the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty," White House spokesman Mike McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, noting that two years ago Thursday he became the first
world leader to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, urged the
Senate to ratify the convention early next year.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, 150 countries have signed the treaty,
including Russia and China, but not India or Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The treaty bans all nuclear explosions and is meant to
constrain the development of more sophisticated and powerful
nuclear weapons, as well as to limit the spread of nuclear arms
technologies.
</P>
<P>
Opponents in the Republican-controlled Senate say compliance to
the treaty cannot be verified.
</P>
<P>
"The American people understand that Senate approval of the
CTBT is the right thing to do," Clinton said. "I strongly urge the
Senate to give its advice and consent as early as possible next
year."
</P>
<P>
In an address to the opening session of the U.N. General
Assembly on Wednesday, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said
his country was ready to adhere to the test ban treaty. But he
said it would depend on whether rival India resumed its tests.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made no direct mention of Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee's speech to the U.N. General Assembly on Thursday.
Vajpayee said India wanted the treaty to go into force no later
than September 1999.
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to further discussion with the leaders of
Pakistan and India as we emphasize our common obligation to build
peace and security," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said Clinton had not yet decided whether to go ahead
with his plan to visit India and Pakistan in November as part of
an Asia trip, which was put on hold after India and Pakistan
caught the world by surprise by exploding nuclear devices.

<HEADLINE> Biotechnology Revolution for 21st Century Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- An international panel of
experts said here Thursday that there was an urgent need to harness
"biotechnology revolution" to help the poor and protect the
environment in the 21st century and public research should be
provided for all humanity.
</P>
<P>
Scientists predict that biotechnology could contribute to more
food on the same area of land, thereby reducing pressure to expand
into wilderness, rain forest or marginal lands that support
biodiversity and vital ecosystem services.
</P>
<P>
It could reduce post-harvest loss of food and improve the
quality of fresh and processed foods, thus boosting the "realized
nutritional yield" per hectare.
</P>
<P>
It also could displace resource -- and energy -- intensive
inputs, such as fuel, fertilizers or pesticides, thus reducing
unintended impacts on the environment.
</P>
<P>
Such new scientific opportunities need a unique leadership
effort to be mobilized and provided to the regions that need them
urgently to feed their growing population, noted the panel, which
assessed the work of the Consultative Group on International
Agricultural Research (CGIAR).
</P>
<P>
The CGIAR, founded in 1971, consists of 16 international
agricultural research centers around the world, most in developing
countries, and was backed by the Food And Agriculture Organization
of the United Nations, the U.N. Development Program and the World
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Productivity and natural resource management are the twin
pillars of CGIAR research on aquatic resources, biodiversity, food
crops, forestry and agro-forestry, livestock, soil and water
nutrients, water management, and agriculture-related policies.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the CGIAR was one of the best organizations to
serve the developing countries in the agricultural research, panel
chairman Maurice Strong said at a press briefing that global food
security looms as society's largest challenge as we enter the next
century. "Through its science and experience, the CGIAR can
contribute to the solution of this problem."
</P>
<P>
The panel said scientific revolution taking place in biology
and information technology are a major cause for optimism. But a
strong research system like CGIAR is needed to form the scientific
and institutional linkages necessary for ensuring that the poor
will benefit from the cutting-edge science.
</P>
<P>
It suggested the CGIAR adjust its strategy to take full
advantage of opportunities in integrated gene management,
integrated natural resource management and information technology.
</P>
<P>
It also recommended the CGIAR establish a global network for
integrated natural resources management to link productivity
research with environmentally-sound management of the eath's
natural resources.

<HEADLINE> Coco Cola Company Remains Operational in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 24 (Xinhua)--The U.S.Coca Cola Company will
remain operational in Zambia despite the controversial excise
duty, said the company here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The company said it will contine to produce soft drinks in the
country but it is concerned about the government inability to
honor its promise to reduce the excise duty from 25 percent to
five percent.
</P>
<P>
But it expressed its confidence that the Zambian government
will settle the dispute.
</P>
<P>
In May this year, the government promised to reduce duty on
Coca Cola.
</P>
<P>
The company increased two weeks ago the price of its products
from 500 to 900 Kwacha per bottle, the price increase has
inevitably slumped the demand for the products while retailers in
some border areas have started importing soft drinks from
neighboring countries. Last week, the company suspened its
production and threatened to pull out of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
But some Zambian government officials have branded the company
as a black-mailer which has for a long time been evading taxes.
