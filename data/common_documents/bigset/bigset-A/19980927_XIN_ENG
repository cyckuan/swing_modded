<P>
CAIRO, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- Yemen is, for the first time, to host a conference on
oil and gas Monday and a total of 300 local and foreign companies,
banks and organizations will be present.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yemeni Minister of Oil and Mineral Resources Muhamed
Al Khadim will inaugurate Sunday the second expansion of Dahab oil
field in Ganna sector on the former borders of pre-union Yemen,
the Arabic Al Hayat reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The expansion project can increase the output by 20,000 to
50,000 barrels per day to enable the total daily production of the
field to reach 400,000 barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
RABAT -- Morocco will import 2,6 million tonnes of grain this
year to offset the shortage between its annual consumption of
about 10 million tonnes and its 7 million tonnes of production.
</P>
<P>
The expected grain imports this year are slightly lower than
those of last year due to the improved harvest of the country.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon's Central Bank governor Riad Salameh
predicted Friday that Lebanese interest rates will be cut in the
near future, the official National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Salameh made the prediction at a conference on capital flows
and emerging markets organized by the Beirut-based Center for
Emerging Market Studies.
</P>
<P>
"I think that the interest rates are going to fall in the near
future because of the decline in inflation in Lebanon, as
inflation is below 5 percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran earned some 600 million dollars from
agricultural exports during the past Iranian year ending March 20,
the official news agency IRNA reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural products, including fresh and dried fruits, and
vegetables, comprise only 2 percent of the country's total exports,
the agency said.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The Arab Bank, Jordan's largest bank, has recently
decided to open two more branches in Beirut at the beginning of
next year to expand its network in the country.
</P>
<P>
The bank, which currently has 10 branches in Lebanon, is
involved in offering loans to Lebanon's civil war-gutted hotels
and hospitals as well as electricity and communications projects.
</P>
<P>
The two branches will finance medium- to long-term economic and
infrastructure projects in Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Blocked River in Nepal Flows Over Debris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Kali Gandaki River, one
of the biggest in Nepal which was blocked upstream Saturday
morning as a result of a landslide, started flowing over the
debris in the afternoon, the official RSS news agency said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> New Bosnian Serb President Advocates Amending Dayton Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Nikola Poplasen, the newly
elected president of the Bosnian Serb Republic, said he advocates
amending the Dayton peace accord to gain more for the Bosnian
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Poplasen told a Sarajevo-based magazine Friday that his
long-term strategic goal of uniting his republic with the Republic
of Serbia and the Republic of Montenegro, which constitutes
Yugoslavia today, remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
It may take five, 10 or 20 years to accomplish the goal, he
said, adding the Dayton accord could be amended through agreements
among the three ethnic groups and the two entities in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
As far the accord, brokered by the United States as an
effective measure to end the 1992-1995 Bosnian war, the
president-elect said his Serb Radical Party would like to see its
full implementation.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, the party would advocate the policies of
opening up and respecting democratic principles.
</P>
<P>
He alleged that Milorad Dodik, currently premier of the Serb
republic, had misinterpreted the Dayton accord, compromising many
of the rights entitled to the Serb entity in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Poplasen defeated Western-backed incumbent president, Biljana
Plavsic, in the September 12-13 election to become the new
president of the Serb Republic for the next four years.
</P>
<P>
Some Western countries have expressed concerns over Poplasen's
presidency. Gelbard, the U.S. envoy who visited Banja Luka, the
capital of the Serb entity, said Thursday that Washington had
"serious questions" about Poplasen's willingness to implement the
Dayton accord.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Export Turnover Falls Short of Expectation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's export turnover was
up 4.1 percent in the year's first nine months but, if converted
into annual rate, was short of the government's expectation.
</P>
<P>
The nine-month increase, over the same period last year,
prompted the government's trade ministry to believe that it would
be hard to reach the year's export growth target of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as reported Saturday by the Vietnam News Agency
(VNA), the country's trade deficit was 1.65 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam sold abroad over 8.6 million tons of crude oil, the
country's top export merchandise in the year's first nine months,
a rise of 21 percent against the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
However, said the report, the price of its exported crude oil
was down 30 to 40 percent compared to the 1997 average. As a
result, the export turnover fell despite the increased volume.
</P>
<P>
In addition, prolonged natural disasters since the late 1997
have brought down the exports of many agricultural products,
including cashew nuts by nine percent, pepper 25 percent and
vegetables and fruits more than 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government has taken measures to boost exports,
such as launching an export award fund and reducing interest rates
for businesses that produce and deal in a number of export items.

<HEADLINE> Israel Developing New Anti-Missile System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 26 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli Defense Ministry
adviser has said that Israel is developing a new defense and
attack system that can destroy missiles after they are launched
from hostile neighbors, Israel Radio reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The adviser, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did not
elaborate on the new system, only saying that the size of the
missile system is similar to that of the Arrow anti-missile
missile, the radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Israel successfully conducted an integrated test of its
"Arrow" missile system in mid-September, which is been developing
with the support of the U.S..
</P>
<P>
But some strategists have warned against being carried away by
the technological success of the test, saying that the system is
limited in many areas.
</P>
<P>
Designed to track and destroy offensive missiles, the "Arrow"
will not be effective enough to protect the country since in an
extended attack, some warheads are likely to get through, critics
say.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a more advanced system is needed as more advanced
offensive missiles are obtained by Israel's bitter rivals Iran,
Iraq and Syria, they said.
</P>
<P>
Israel has said that Syria, who has territorial disputes with
Israel over the Golan Heights, is strengthening its Scud missile
system and developing warheads with nerve gas.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Ruling Parties Move for Stronger Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The ruling parties in Nepal
Saturday decided to form a three-tier coordination committee for
better implementation of the agreement and understanding between
them, the official RSS news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of top leaders of the Nepali Congress and the
Communist Party of Nepal (Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML) decided to
form a central coordination committee comprising top leaders of
the two parties, a ministerial committee comprising ministers and
a four-member committee in all the 75 districts of the country,
RSS said.
</P>
<P>
It said the committees will provide guidelines to the
government for implementation of the agreement and understanding
reached between the two ruling partners.
</P>
<P>
The decision came exactly one month after the CPN-ML joined the
minority government led by the Nepali Congress.
</P>
<P>
In late August, the two partners reached a 25-point agreement
on policies and priorities of the new coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that as the two partners have different
principles, the committees to be formed may help iron out
potential differences and disputes, thus contributing to a stable
coalition government at least until the next general elections due
by November 1999.
</P>
<P>
For the government, the biggest challenge is infighting between
its partners, as it enjoys a comfortable majority of at least 128
seats in the 205-member Lower House of Parliament, strong enough
to fend off any outside attack.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Built Car Oil Company in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian oil colossus LUKoil
Saturday laid the cornerstone for its first car oil company in
Romania, the biggest of its kind in Central and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
The company, as a new unit of the Petrotel refinery recently
purchased by LUKoil, is estimated to cost about four million U.S.
dollars and will be functional in six months.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the cornerstone laying ceremony in Ploiesti
(southern Romania), Romania's President Emil Constantinescu said
that LUKOIL had brought "not just money but also the wish to be at
the top in its field."
</P>
<P>
The visiting LUKoil General Manager Vagit Alekperov said the
ceremony marked the beginning of a unique project since his
company was the first Russian private company to invest in
Romania. He highlighted the good relations between Russia and
Romania in the field of oil.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian President Friday highly appraised LUKoil's
activity in Romania after meeting the LUKoil delegation at the
Cotroceni presidential palace, saying that the Petrotel refinery
is a type of private companies the Romanian state would like to
encourage.
</P>
<P>
According to Alekperov, LUKoil would continue to invest in
Romania for the setting up in Bucharest of a Black Sea
distribution center for its products.
</P>
<P>
In February, LUKoil purchased the majority share package of
Petrotel with an investment of 300 million U.S. dollars, and
became the first Russian colossus which invested in Romania in
recent years.

<HEADLINE> Ghana to Take Liberia's Former Warlord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Liberia's former warlord
Roosevelt Johnson will travel to Ghana Saturday where he will
stay while the United States and Liberia sort out what should
happen to him, a report from Sierra Leone's capital Freetown
said.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a commander of the West African
peace-keeping force ECOMOG as saying that Johnson, who arrived
there by helicopter Friday, would travel on a scheduled
commercial flight to Accra, capital of Ghana.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, a major rival of President Charles Taylor during
Liberia's seven-year civil war, was at the center of a six-day
stand-off at the U.S. embassy in Liberian capital Monrovia after
he took refugee there last Saturday in fear of his life.
</P>
<P>
"Johnson will leave under ECOMOG protection this afternoon by
Ghana Airways for Accra," the ECOMOG commander said, "The Ghana
government has agreed to grant him asylum while the United
States and the government of Liberia finally sort out his fate."
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who launched Liberia's civil war in 1989 and finally
won power in 1997 in a multi-party election monitored by ECOMOG,
accused Johnson of treason, murder, rape and kidnaping and had
demanded that he be handed over.
</P>
<P>
Washington said after flying him out to Freetown that he would
be tried in abstention in Monrovia. The report also quoted
diplomats as saying that if found guilty at a trial monitored by
international observers, the understanding was that he would be
returned.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, together with two of his sons, two close aides and
more than 20 supporters, left the U.S. embassy Friday afternoon
in two helicopters piloted by Russians arranged by the ECOMOG,
according to another report from Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
Johnson and his supporters forced their way into the U.S.
embassy on September 19, when they were hunted by Liberian
government troops who attempted to arrest him on treason and
other charges.
</P>
<P>
The government troops rounded up Johnson and his supporters in
their stronghold in central Monrovia on September 18, sparking
off heavy fightings that forced thousands of citizens fleeing
their homes and claimed at least 47 lives, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
Aid agencies said the loss of life could be as high as 350.
</P>
<P>
At least three of Johnson's supporters were killed and two
American employees of the embassy injured when Liberian forces
shot from outside the embassy, while Johnson was negotiating with
embassy officials for admission.
</P>
<P>
Security had been greatly increased at the U.S. embassy and
most diplomats were evacuated. U.S. military reinforcements were
sent in to help shore up the embassy's defense, machine gun nests
were set up on the roof and diplomats seldom moved without flak
jackets and helmets.
</P>
<P>
The American diplomats, who have seen themselves as living
under siege for a week, were happy to see Johnson go.
</P>
<P>
"I am glad this is over," Deputy Chief of Mission John Bauwan
was quoted by the report as saying.

KAMPALA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan President Pasteur
Bizimungu made a short working visit to Uganda Saturday during
which he held closed-door talks with President Yoweri Museveni.
</P>
<P>
Hope Kevegere, press secretary to President Museveni, told
Xinhua Saturday evening that the talks focused on bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
However, she did not reveal whether they also talked about the
deepening crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The talks were held in President Museveni's home at Rwakitura
in southwestern district of Mbarara, she added.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda have been accused by DRC President Laurent
Kabila of fomenting and backing the rebellion which erupted in
DRC's capital Kinshasa on August 2 and spread quickly to other
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Both Rwanda and Uganda denied the charge. Rwanda said it did
not send troops to back the Tutsi rebels in DRC while Uganda
admitted its military presence in the central African country but
it said the troops there are safeguarding the national security
of Uganda.
</P>
<P>
With the deepening of the crisis, more African countries began
to side with President Kabila, leaving Rwanda and Uganda a bit
lonely.

<HEADLINE> Adamu's Funeral Held in Brussels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 26 (Xinhua) -- More than 5,000 people
attended the funeral service held here on Saturday for Semira
Adamu, the Nigerian refugee who died of brain haemorrhage
sustained during forced deportation.
</P>
<P>
The funeral service was held at Brussels' St. Michel cathedral
by those who have lent their sympathy and support to the
20-year-old woman in her effort to stay.
</P>
<P>
Adamu died on Tuesday in a local hospital after losing
consciousness as the result of suffocation.
</P>
<P>
Two Belgian gendarmes used a cushion to muffle Adamu's screams
while escorting her onto a Nigeria-bound flight early that day.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian gendarme on Saturday offered "profound regret and
sincere condolences" to Adamu's family and friends.
</P>
<P>
An investigation was already launched into the death of Adamu
and one of the two gendarmerie involved in Tuesday's incident had
been found to have been disciplined in a similar case previously.
</P>
<P>
Belgian Interior Minister Louis Tobback handed in his
resignation letter but was given 24 hours to ponder on his
decision to resign. He is expected to announce whether to resign
soon.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian cabinet met on Friday to discuss the incident and
declined to accept Tobback's resignation. Belgium has halted the
country's deportation of refugees for the time being.
</P>
<P>
If Tobback's resignation was accepted, it would be the second
time within six months for an interior minister to resign over
errors committed by the gendarmerie.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, Tobback's predecessor resigned after
alleged child rapist and killer Marc Dutroux overwhelmed escorting
gendarmes and escaped from a pre-trial hearing.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Persecution of Afghan Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 26 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian official here
on Saturday dismissed the claims as "pure fabrication" that
Afghan refugees were being persecuted in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the official news agency IRNA, deputy director
general of the foreign nationals and expatriates department at
the Interior Ministry Abdulreza Haji Arab denied the recent
claim of the Afghan Taliban militia on the safety of Afghan
refugees living in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Haji Arab said that no move has been made against Afghan
refugees so far which could be inconsistent with the
international conventions.
</P>
<P>
The crime of the Afghan Taliban militia in killing Iranian
diplomats and journalist have not had any negative impact on
the safety of Afghan refugees residing in Iran, he said.
</P>
<P>
Haji Arab said that the Iranian government and nation treat
Afghan refugees based on Islamic principles and international
conventions and would spare no efforts to support the oppressed
Muslim nation of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) representative
offices in Tehran and several other provinces are supervising
all affairs concerning refugees, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, an Iranian newspaper reported on Tuesday that some
Iranians took advantage of the present circumstances between
Iran and the Taliban clashed with Afghan refugees in Iran.
</P>
<P>
A group of 40 Iranians clashed with Afghan refugees in
Isfahan province on September 11 and injured some of them, an
official from the province was quoted by Iran Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
The clash came one day after the Taliban confirmed the
killing of nine Iranian diplomats and reporter in northern
Afghanistan, which angered the Iranian nation.
</P>
<P>
Iranian leaders and authorities pledged to take revenge on
the Taliban for the killing, but the Iranian government is
making efforts to solve the issue through diplomatic channels.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- A Ugandan delegation, that
took part in the newly-ended 27th session of the Joint Assembly
regrouping members of Parliament from 71 countries in Brussels,
condemned military intervention in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) by some African countries.
</P>
<P>
The delegation warned that this intervention will distort the
trend of political events in the DRC, Radio Uganda reported
Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
It also refuted allegations by the DRC that Uganda invaded the
country, noting that the presence of Ugandan troops in eastern
part of DRC was a result of a mutual agreement reached between
the two governments.
</P>
<P>
On the deepening crisis in Africa's third largest country, the
delegation informed the assembly that armed rebellion is not a
new phenomenon in the country since this is the third major armed
civil conflict since DRC independence.
</P>
<P>
The Tutsi-led rebellions erupted in DRC on August 2 and
quickly spread to the whole country. President Laurent Kabila has
accused Uganda of backing the rebels, a charge Kampala
immediately denied.
</P>
<P>
In mid-August, troops from Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia went
to help Kabila out, turning the tide of war against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The eight-week conflict drew regional as well as global
attention. The Organization for African Unity and the
international community are making fresh efforts in a bid to
solve the problem through peaceful means.

<HEADLINE> Sanctions Cause More Deaths in Iraq: Ministry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The mortality rate of Iraq's
children and elderly has risen significantly due to the United
Nations trade embargo, the Health Ministry said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In statistics carried by the Iraqi News Agency, the ministry
said that 6,717 children under the age of five died in August,
bringing the total in the first half of this year to 39,468.
</P>
<P>
The number of deaths of Iraqi elderly above 50 reached 2,157 in
August, sending the figure for the first seven months to 47,994.
</P>
<P>
The ministry accused the eight-year-old, crippling
U.N. economic sanctions of causing the serious death rate of the
Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council imposed the sanctions on Iraq in 1990
after its invasion of Kuwait, barring it from exporting oil, its
main revenue earner. This has led to acute shortage of food and
medicine in the country.
</P>
<P>
The statistics showed that 2,917 children died of diarrhea in
August, compared with 159 in the same period in 1989. Those deaths
caused by pneumonia and respiratory infections rose to 1,191 last
month from 53 nine years earlier.
</P>
<P>
Malnutrition-related deaths among children rose to 2,606 in
August from 90 in the same month in 1989.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics, a total of 466 people above 50
died of heart diseases and hypertension last August, compared with
81 cases in the same month in 1989.
</P>
<P>
The number of the elderly dying of diabetes increased to 316 in
August, 1998 from 81 nine years earlier, and those who died of
malignant neoplasms went up to 1,375 last month from 335 in the
same month of 1989.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Chairman Meets Taiwan Buddhists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, a member of the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China, met here today with a
Taiwan delegation which has come to take the sariras (bone ashes
of master monks) of Xuan Zang, an ancient Chinese monk, to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Extending a welcome to the visitors, Li, who is also
chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), called Xuan
Zang's sariras to Taiwan a very significant event, which will
help boost Buddhist and cultural exchanges between compatriots on
both sides of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Xuan Zang's parietal bone sariras is currently housed in the
Linggu Temple in Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Li congratulated the Taiwanese visitors on a successful
mission.
</P>
<P>
The religious exchange program across the Taiwan Straits is an
important component of cross-straits exchanges, he said, and many
insightful Buddhists in Taiwan have done much for the development
of cross-strait relations in recent years.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped Buddhists on both sides of the Taiwan Straits
will take part in more meaningful activities and arrive at common
understandings through cultural exchanges to contribute to China's
peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
Li said Buddhism has become part of traditional Chinese culture
in its long course of development, and many Buddhist propositions,
such as charity, are in line with the ethical and cultural
progress that China is working toward.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Buddhists will give full play to the
positive part of Buddhist theology and have them serve social and
cultural progress.

<HEADLINE> Li Stresses Curbs on Judicial Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, China's top
legislator, has called for greater efforts in educating and
disciplining judicial and law enforcement personnel.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the National People's Congress Standing
Committee and member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, made his
remarks during an inspection tour to Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region from September 24 to 27.
</P>
<P>
After hearing reports from the Autonomous Region's Higher
People's Court and the People's Procuratorate yesterday, Li warned
judicial bodies not to take the "educational rectification
campaign" as a temporary move, but to further it by taking
efficient measures to curb judicial corruption.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the building of a fair, honest and efficient
work force by improving the quality of judicial department
officials.
</P>
<P>
Li spoke highly of the progress made in Baotou, one of the
country's major iron and steel producers, during its anti-drug
campaign, and said Chinese people suffered from drugs in the late
19th century, calling this a lesson that should always be
remembered.
</P>
<P>
He also urged regional governments to make full use of laws to
efficiently battle drug-related crimes and protect people,
especially younger ones.
</P>
<P>
During his inspection of several state-run large-and-medium
enterprises, Li pointed out that redundancy should be avoided in
order to promote enterprise production and improve efficiency.
</P>
<P>
He expressed great concern for the situation of laid-off
workers and said, "Governments at all levels should do their best
to ensure the basics of life for the local unemployed, and at the
same time create more opportunities to help them become
reemployed."
</P>
<P>
This morning, Li held talks with representatives attending the
ongoing fifth plenary meeting of the Standing Committee of the
People's Congress of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. He
called for people's congresses at various levels to strengthen
their supervision of work and law enforcement and contribute more
to China's democracy.
</P>
<P>
During his four-day inspection, Li visited a town in the
Xing'an League, which suffered heavy flooding this summer. While
paying a visit to the construction sites, Li encouraged villagers
there to rebuild their homes and restore production under the
leadership of the Party and government.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Emphasizes All-Round Rural Reform (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Referring to the deepening of rural reform, Jiang
pointed out that a long-term management mechanism based on the
household contract and land contract systems must be maintained.
</P>
<P>
The central government has now adopted a very clear land
contract policy which will prolong the contract period for another
30 years, and it may not be necessary to change the policy even
then, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang outlined the target of deepening rural economic reform
based on household contract management, and supported by the
agricultural socialization service, the marketing system for
agricultural products, and the government's support and protection
of agriculture, and it must also comply with the development of
socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
Expanding grass-roots level democracy in rural areas and
guaranteeing democratic rights of the farmers are the most
extensive practices of socialist democracy in rural areas, Jiang
said.
</P>
<P>
At present, the government must work toward the direct election
of village committees, open discussion among the villagers and
making the village affairs known among the village members, he
said, noting the the expansion of democracy in rural areas must
adhere to the leadership of the Party and must be carried out in
accordance with law, and in orderly arrangement.
</P>
<P>
As for the long-term development of agriculture, Jiang cited
water, and science and technology as two important areas. He also
urged governments at each level to take practical steps to build
agricultural infrastructural facilities and adhere to the
guideline of invigorating agriculture through science and
education.
</P>
<P>
In this way, agricultural growth can be brought on the track of
relying on scientific and technological progress, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has
urged the maintenance of currency stability and avoidance of
financial risk in a recent circular.
</P>
<P>
The State Council ordered local administrations to further
monitor foreign exchange and debt, and crack down on exchange
infractions such as the evasion of foreign exchange payment and
black market activities, the circular said.
</P>
<P>
With the development of reform and opening-up, China has
experienced a sound position in international payments and foreign
exchange balance and a rapid increase of foreign currency
reserves, the circular said.
</P>
<P>
However, some localities and businesses have randomly floated
overseas loans without authorization, it said.
</P>
<P>
The State Council ordered a more strict administration of
financial and foreign exchange institutes to prevent the evasion
of foreign exchange payments.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank and the State Administration of Foreign
Exchange should better supervise foreign exchange dealings in the
banks and institutes which are authorized to engage in such
business.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the circular, the central government will
also standardize foreign trade agent services and strengthen the
administration of the processing trade with overseas enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The SAFE must punish businesses which buy foreign exchange from
banks without documents and letters of credit, or with fake
documents and letters of credit.
</P>
<P>
If enterprises with import and export management rights
are involved in illegal dealings to a total value of more
than one million U.S. dollars, the government will revoke
their import-export permits, and accordingly punish those
responsible for the infractions, the circular said.

<P>
In addition, Customs offices throughout the country are urged to
strengthen their administration on customs declarations and
documents concerning foreign exchange payments.
</P>
<P>
A computerized network covering the entire country between the
Customs and foreign exchange administrations should be
established for more effective management.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, nationwide administrative offices for industry and
commerce should clear out unqualified companies which have no
capital, warehouses or regular offices. Those who evade foreign
exchange payment and engage in arbitrage must be punished
severely, the circular said.
</P>
<P>
Public security departments should investigate the cases of
falsifying documents and letters of credit, and outlaw foreign
exchange black markets, it added.
</P>
<P>
It also urged strict control on the scale of foreign loans
and better administration of foreign exchange in capital accounts.
</P>
<P>
The state will implement uniform supervision of the total
volume and structure of foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the state forbids illegal overseas financing. Only
State Council-authorized official bodies have the right to borrow
money from international monetary organizations and foreign
governments. At the same time, governmental departments without
authorization are banned from introducing foreign loans on their
own.
</P>
<P>
State-owned financial institutes must have authorization from
the central bank, the People's Bank of China, before borrowing
money from overseas organizations, the circular said.
</P>
<P>
It also urged standardized guarantees for overseas financing.
Governmental bodies and organizations affiliated with the government
are forbidden to provide financial guarantees for any enterprise.
</P>
<P>
The authorities must strictly control the prepayment of foreign
loans. Buying foreign currencies with the Chinese yuan for prepayment
is strictly forbidden, the circular stressed.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Decides to Enunciate National Fisheries Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's National Committee
of Fisheries and Shrimp (NCFS) Sunday decided to enunciate a
national policy to transfer the management rights of the country's
water bodies from the land and fisheries and livestock ministries
gradually, to bring about sustainable development of fisheries
resources, the official BSS news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting of the NCFS, presided over by Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina, also decided to make arrangements for providing
loans to the fisheries sector like other sectors of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The meeting decided to set up hatchery zones at southeast and
southwest districts of Cox's Bazar and Satkhira and other specific
areas for the production of shrimp and tiger prawn fries which
would be supplied to different shrimp beds of the country.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister stressed the need for increasing fish
resources with the rise in the country's population to meet the
growing protein need, mentioning that the country can fetch huge
foreign exchange through shrimp cultivation.
</P>
<P>
The lands which do not yield crops could be used for shrimp
culture, she said.
</P>
<P>
She noted that there was mismanagement in the fisheries sector
in the past in the absence of any policy and principles.
</P>
<P>
Necessary measures have to be taken for protecting the fish
fries and the existing laws in this regard have to be strictly
followed, she emphasized.
</P>
<P>
She also called for the culture of pearls, turtles, frogs,
snails, etc., as these have potential markets abroad and are
helpful for maintaining ecological balance.
</P>
<P>
The fisheries sector is an important foreign exchange earner of
the country, which has identified the sector as a thrust. The
government in its fifth five-year plan has allocated a total of
5.861 billion taka (124.7 million U.S. dollars) for the sector,
targeting at 2.075 million tons at the end (2001-2002) of the
five-year plan.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Emphasizes All-Round Rural Reform (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said here on Friday that Party committees and governments at all
levels must give priority to agriculture development and continue
to push ahead with rural reform in accordance with the socialist
market economy.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also general secretary of the Central Committee
of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and chairman of the Central
Military Commission, conducted an inspection tour in east China's
Anhui Province from September 21 to 26, and delivered an important
speech in Hefei, capital of Anhui, on September 25.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the experience of China's rural reform over the past
two decades, Jiang noted that a new framework, in line with the
socialist market economy, has basically come into being in the
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Overall agricultural-production capacity has greatly increased,
and farmers' living standards have improved remarkably, he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the success of China's rural reform is a
great victory of Deng Xiaoping Theory, and the course of rural
reform demonstrates that only Deng Xiaoping Theory can free China
from the restraint of old concepts and a rigid system, and carry
out the building of socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Without Deng Xiaoping Theory, China would not have a complete
set of basic policies on the Party's rural work at present, and
would not have today's huge achievements, he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that gaining the farmers' enthusiasm is the primary
starting point in drawing up rural policies.
</P>
<P>
Government at each level must audaciously explore
effective ways of realizing public ownership in rural areas,
improving the structure of the rural ownership system, and stick to
the market orientation of rural reform, Jiang said, noting
that these are basic experience of rural reform and must be
firmly followed up.

<HEADLINE> AL Urges Arab Backing for Palestinian State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary-General
Esmat Abdel Meguid Sunday urged Arab countries to throw their full
weight behind the Palestinian stand to declare an independent
Palestinian state, terming it a legal right of the Palestinian
people.
</P>
<P>
"The 1947 U.N. Resolution 181, regarded as the birth
certificate for Israel, has also provided for the establishment of
the state of Palestine," the top Arab diplomat was quoted by the
Middle East News Agency as saying before his departure for New
York to attend the current U.N. General Assembly meetings.
</P>
<P>
He said that the declaration of the Palestinian state would
top the agenda of his talks with U.N. chief Kofi Annan and other
officials.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat has
vowed to declare the Palestinian state on May 4, 1999, which marks
the deadline for the Oslo interim peace accords.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Meguid called for Arab countries to support the
Palestinian stand at the U.N. and endeavor to consolidate the
stature of the envisaged state.
</P>
<P>
Libya's Lockerbie row with the West as well as Iraq's standoff
with the U.N. will figure out prominently in Abdel Meguid's
discussions in New York.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said Friday that he had the "sacred right" to declare a
state in the West Bank and Gaza strip in May 1999 and asked for
international backing. He will address the 53rd U.N. General
Assembly session on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned on Thursday
that such a declaration would lead to a "complete collapse" of
the Mideast peacemaking and that Israel would retaliate.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli negotiations have been languishing
since March 1996. Both sides are haggling over a U.S. proposal on
a 13 percent Israeli West Bank withdrawal.

<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The relocation of Zigui
County, hometown of China's great ancient poet Qu Yuan, has been
completed to make way for the construction of the gigantic Three
Gorges Dam.
</P>
<P>
The relocation program will replace 100,000 residents, and the
entire county will be relocated to Maoping town, one kilometer
away from the Three Gorges Project on the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Zigui County is the first place to complete replacement among
the 11 towns in the Three Gorges Dam area to be relocated before
they are submerged when the project is completed early next
century.
</P>
<P>
The State Council approved the relocation of Zigui County in
June 1991. Construction of the new county, which is 37 kilometers
from the old one, began in 1993.
</P>
<P>
With a total investment of 390 million yuan (47 million
U.S. dollars), infrastructural facilities including
transportation, electricity, and post and telecommunications
networks have been installed in the new county over the past six
years.
</P>
<P>
By early September, some 180 governmental institutions had
moved to the new site and 18,600 residents had begun their new
life in new homes.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Agreements will be signed here
next Sunday on the U.S. economic aid program to Egypt, according
to official economic sources here.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State for Planning and International Cooperation
Zafer el-Beshri will sign for Egypt and Ambassador Daniel Kurtzer
for the United States.
</P>
<P>
Around 15 ministers have been invited to attend the signing
ceremony which will be followed by a press conference to be given
by el-Beshri and Kurtzer, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress has agreed in principle to offer 775 million
U.S. dollars economic aid to Egypt in the next U.S. fiscal
year. The figure is 40 million dollars lower than the 1998
assistance. The aid will be cut by 5 percent annually for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Congress has, however, approved to keep military aid to Egypt
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The cut, to be in place starting in October U.S. fiscal year,
is in line with the U.S. policy of cutting foreign assistance.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. foreign aid budget has been including 815 million
dollars for Egypt, and 1.2 billion for Israel, in addition to
the aid earmarked for international organizations. Cairo also gets
1.3 billion dollars in military aid from Washington every year.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and the U.S. have held an array of talks in both Cairo
and Washington since July on establishing a new system of
cooperation that puts emphasis on enhancing economic and trade
cooperation and rescheduling the aid program.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Tel Aviv District Court
sentenced Margalit Har Shefi to nine months in prison Sunday
morning for failing to prevent the assassination of former
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
Har Shefi, a close girl friend of convicted assassin Yigal Amir,
also received a suspended sentence of 15 months.
</P>
<P>
Rabin was assassinated by Amir at a peace rally in Tel Aviv in
November 1995.
</P>
<P>
The judge said that if Har Shefi had shown more responsibility
and taken a more vigorous action, it would be possible that the
murder might not have occurred.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have asked a maximum penalty of two years, arguing
that Har Shefi knew two previous attempts by Amir to kill Rabin.
</P>
<P>
But 22-year-old Har Shefi claimed that she was innocent and
said she would appeal the sentence.
</P>
<P>
Har Shefi was convicted in June of failing to prevent the
crime. And she would begin her prison term on October 27 if her
appeal was rejected.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Labor party welcomed the sentence, saying in a
statement that it is important three years after Rabin's
assassination to see the justice has been done for the
perpetrators, accomplices and those who failed to prevent the
crime.

WASHINGTON, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Seven southeastern European countries agreed to create a
multinational military force that could be used for peacekeeping
or aid operations in the Balkans and elsewhere. The defense
ministers of Italy, Greece, Turkey, Albania, Bulgaria, Macedonia
and Romania signed a pact creating the force after meeting in the
Macedonian capital, Skopje. It will probably be ready sometime
next year.
</P>
<P>
-- Just three months before a new era in the history of
Medicare is to begin, members of Congress and health policy
experts are expressing alarm that the Federal Medicare agency
cannot make many of the changes scheduled to take effect over the
next two years.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The House of Representatives of the United States on
Saturday passed an 80 billion U.S. dollar tax cut package and sent
it onto rough sailing in the Senate. President Bill Clinton
promised to veto it, repeating the Democratic criticism that the
measure is paid for by dipping into the budget surplus generated
by Social Security funds.
</P>
<P>
-- Residents from Pensacola, Florida, to New Orleans, Luisiana,
fortified their homes and moved farther inland as forecasters
predicted that Hurricane Georges could hit shores as early as
Sunday morning. The storm, which killed more than 260 people in
the Caribbean, had struck southern Florida Saturday before
entering the Gulf of Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Somali Rights Group Calls for Release of Sportsmen  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Dr. Ismail Jumale Human
Rights Center, the local human rights organization in Mogadishu,
unconditional release of six apprehended sportsmen.
</P>
<P>
The six members from the sports community of Mogadishu were
held by militiamen claiming to be from an Islamic court run by
their leader Muse Sudi Yalahow in the Medina area of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Muse Sudi Yalahow is one of those opposing Mogadishu
administration and a rival of Ali Mahdi Mohamed, leader of former
north Mogadishu faction.
</P>
<P>
The sports members from a basketball team in Medina were
captured about 11 days ago after holding a friendly match with
other teams in south Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
A sports fan from the area told the press that the
basketballers are not given enough food or water and are now
being kept in a dark room in Medina district for the sole reason
of their openness in sharing friendly games with other teams
elsewhere in the capital.
</P>
<P>
They are also accused of being "traitors" who played with
other teams supporting the Mogadishu administration.
</P>
<P>
The militiamen holding the six men claimed to be continuing an
investigation regarding their cases.
</P>
<P>
The human rights center has characterized the detention of the
six men as illegal and against the free will of the Somalis with
respect to their movements and desires.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in the eight years of the civil strife
in Somalia since 1991 that the sports people are targeted by
militiamen for political reasons.
</P>
<P>
Calls and pleas by different groups from the society have
brought about no results. Likewise, attempts by the Olympic
Committee and its various federations in securing their release
also failed.
</P>
<P>
Some of the local papers reported that Muse Sudi Yalahow
himself has opposed the release of the six sportsmen for what
seemed to be political reason.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Tel Aviv District Court
sentenced Margalit Har Shefi to nine months in prison Sunday
morning for failing to prevent the assassination of former
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
Har Shefi, close friend of convicted assassin Yigal Amir, also
received a suspended sentence of 15 months.
</P>
<P>
Rabin was assassinated by Amir at a peace rally in Tel Aviv in
November 1995.
</P>
<P>
The judge said that if Har Shefi has shown more responsibility
and taken a more vigorous action, it was possible that the murder
might not have occurred.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have asked a maximum penalty of two years, arguing
that Har Shefi knew two previous attempts by Amir to kill Rabin.
</P>
<P>
But 22-year-old Har Shefi claimed that he was innocent and
said he would appeal the sentence.
</P>
<P>
Har Shefi was convicted of failing to prevent the crime in
June. And he would begin his prison term on October 27 if his
appeal was rejected.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Labor party welcomed the sentence, saying in a
statement that it is important three years after Rabin's
assassination to see the justice has been done for the
perpetrators, accomplices and those who failed to prevent the
crime.

<HEADLINE> Feature: A Special Visit to Pioneers of Rural Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- On the eve of the 20th
anniversary of China's reforms, President Jiang Zemin paid a
special visit to Xiaogang, a small village in Anhui Province and a
pace-setter of the country's rural reform.
</P>
<P>
One cold night 20 years ago, 18 farmers in Xiaogang signed an
agreement to contract the then collectively owned farmland. The
practice later developed into the renowned "household contract
responsibility system with remuneration linked to output" carried
out in rural areas throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
On September 22, the president walked into the village's
exhibition room filled with pictures showing the great changes in
Xiaogang in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Yan Junchang, leader of the village in 1978, told the president
that in 1979, the second year after they instituted the contract
system, the village had a grain output of 65,000 kilograms, equal
the total in the 15 years from 1955 to 1970.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed pleasures over the marvelous achievements the
villagers have made, praising the farmer's ability to use very
simple words to state clearly the benefits of the contract system.
</P>
<P>
After visiting the village's library and the farmers' school of
technology, the president talked with farmers in one of their
homes.
</P>
<P>
"This is my first visit to the village, but I have always been
concerned about its development because Deng Xiaoping's policy of
reforms and opening up first bore fruits in the rural areas, and
Xiaogang was the first," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the household contract responsibility system
would not change. The contract system will last for another 30
years, and it need not change after that, he said.
</P>
<P>
Villagers were impressed by the president's talk and responded
with warm applause during his speech.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the central government has paid close attention to
agriculture and rural issues. The reforms in rural areas should
continue to be carried out and productivity in rural areas should
be further developed, he said.
</P>
<P>
Efforts should be made to step up research for drawing up
China's agricultural development strategy for the coming century
to promote long-term, steady development of agriculture, Jiang
told the farmers.
</P>
<P>
"This work is of great significance and that is why I came here
to see for myself," the president said. "I just want to
learn from all of you."

<HEADLINE> Somali Rights Group Calls for Release of Sportsmen  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Dr. Ismail Jumale Human
Rights Center, the local human rights organization in Mogadishu,
unconditional release of six apprehended sportsmen.
</P>
<P>
The six members from the sports community of Mogadishu were
held by militiamen claiming to be from an Islamic court run by
their leader Muse Sudi Yalahow in the Medina area of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Muse Sudi Yalahow is one of those opposing Mogadishu
administration and a rival of Ali Mahdi Mohamed, leader of former
north Mogadishu faction.
</P>
<P>
The sports members from a basketball team in Medina were
captured about 11 days ago after holding a friendly match with
other teams in south Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
A sports fan from the area told the press that the
basketballers are not given enough food or water and are now
being kept in a dark room in Medina district for the sole reason
of their openness in sharing friendly games with other teams
elsewhere in the capital.
</P>
<P>
They are also accused of being "traitors" who played with
other teams supporting the Mogadishu administration.
</P>
<P>
The militiamen holding the six men claimed to be continuing an
investigation regarding their cases.
</P>
<P>
The human rights center has characterized the detention of the
six men as illegal and against the free will of the Somalis with
respect to their movements and desires.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in the eight years of the civil strife
in Somalia since 1991 that the sports people are targeted by
militiamen for political reasons.
</P>
<P>
Calls and pleas by different groups from the society have
brought about no results. Likewise, attempts by the Olympic
Committee and its various federations in securing their release
also failed.
</P>
<P>
Some of the local papers reported that Muse Sudi Yalahow
himself has opposed the release of the six sportsmen for what
seemed to be political reason.

<HEADLINE> Besenyei's Winning Streak Snapped in China Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, eastern Shandong Province, September 27 (Xinhua) --
Hungarian Peter Besenyei's winning streak was snapped when
Nikolai Timofeev of Russia won the third leg of the FAI China Cup
aerobatics grand prix here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Timfeev, the son of a World War II fighter pilot for the
former Soviet Union, raked in 9.778 points to snatch the title,
building up his overall tally to 32, only two points short of
Besenyei's leading 34.
</P>
<P>
Besenyei, who won the first two legs, finished runner-up in
the Jinan leg with 9.696. Another Russian Viktor Tchmal came in
third on 9.619 to bring his overall tally to 24.
</P>
<P>
Timfeev's win was somewhat a fluke. "Peter didn't perform well
in the first round yesterday and I took this chance," said the
elated Russian.
</P>
<P>
In the opinion of Chomono Robert, competition supervisor from
France, Besenyei should have won this leg.
</P>
<P>
"Peter's performance is so fantastic, for me he is the best,"
he said. "But it's up to the judges to decide the results."
</P>
<P>
Robert's view was echoed by aerobatic aircraft designer
Charles Wolff of the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Peter is the best aerobatic pilot in the world. He may lose
some competitons, but the eventual winner will be him, for he is
so creative and excellent," said the American.
</P>
<P>
The next leg of the grand prix will be held from October 2-4
in Tianjin, which is 90 minutes' drive southeast from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The grand prix, hailed by FAI president Eilif Ness as the
greatest festival of competitive aerobatics ever held, has
attracted all the top 24 finishers of the world championships
held last August.
</P>
<P>
After the Tianjing leg, the contestants will go on making tour
matches and displays in Chinese cities Shijiazhuang, Zhengzhou,
Wuhan and Changsha.
</P>
<P>
The grand prix is scheduled to end on November 2.

<P>
JERUSALEM, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Jerusalem Magistrate Court
on Sunday banned Jewish settler Avshalom Ladani from entering the
Palestinian territories for his alleged killing of a Palestinian
student last week.
</P>
<P>
The Court also ordered the Israeli police to submit on Monday
the investigation report about the incident and then the Court
will decide what legal actions can be taken against Ladani.
</P>
<P>
Ladani, 35 and from Dolev Settlement in the West Bank, opened
fire to a group of Palestinian students on September 17 near the
West Bank city of Ramallah. One Palestinian student was killed
and another injured in the incident.
</P>
<P>
Ladani surrendered to Jerusalem police that evening and
admitted that he had opened fire toward the Palestinian
students.
</P>
<P>
He also told the police that other settlers in his car, which
was stoned by the students, also opened fire toward the students
and he was not sure that the student was killed by his shooting.
</P>
<P>
Ladani was remanded by the Court on September 18 and two days
later was released and put under "house arrest" in a Jerusalem
hostel pending further charges.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem police said Sunday that the investigation is still
going on and the police has yet to determine if Ladani was the
killer or he fired in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side strongly condemned the shooting and
demanded that Ladani be turned over to the Palestinian court for
trial.

<HEADLINE> Self-Exiled Nigerian Dissident to Return Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Self-exiled Nigerian
dissident, Nobel Prize winner Wole Soyinka is preparing to return
home, Nigerian leader General Abdulsalam Abubakar has said.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar made the announcement in Paris Saturday, where he was
on the last leg of his first major overseas visit, the British
Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar's six-day trip had brought him to Britain and the
United States, during which he had met with British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, U.S. President Bill Clinton and addressed
the 53rd session of the United Nations General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The visit is a remarkable diplomatic achievement as Nigeria is
still under sanctions by the West, including visa ban on all top
government officials.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from New York, Abubakar had a
closed-door meeting with Soyinka at about 7:00 p.m. last Friday
at the New York Palace Hotel.
</P>
<P>
During the one-hour meeting, Abubakar reportedly reassured
Soyinka and his allies abroad that the cost is clear for their
home coming to participate in the new democratization process.
</P>
<P>
Soyinka is returning home following the withdrawal of a
treason charge against him, Abubakar said in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Since his taking office in June, Abubakar has repeatedly
appealed to the country's opposition leaders on self-exile to
return home and join his "all inclusive" democratization program.
</P>
<P>
To prove his sincerity, he has instructed the judiciary
authorities to drop various charges against the dissidents.
</P>
<P>
While in Paris, Abubakar also met with French President
Jacques Chirac, after which he said Chirac had agreed to press
for an early lifting of sanctions against Nigeria, and for urgent
debt relief.

<HEADLINE> Iran Reiterates Decree on Rushdie Irrevocable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Sunday reiterated
that the fatwa (religious decree) issued by late Iranian supreme
leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on the life of British writer
Salman Rushdie is irrevocable.
</P>
<P>
"The irrevocability of the late Imam Khomeini's fatwa (on
Rushdie) is a fact," Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud
Mohammadi said to the official news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi reiterated Iran's
positions on the insulting book the Satanic Verses and its author
(Rushdie) in his statement on Thursday following his meeting with
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, said Mohammadi.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said in New York that the Iranian government has no
intention to take any action to threaten Rushdie's life, or to
encourage or assist anyone to do so.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that any insult to Islamic values would be
under no circumstances acceptable to the Iranians and Muslims
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi's statement was taken by some Western media as
Tehran's assurance to drop Khomeini's fatwa on Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iranian mass media said that Kharrazi's remark has
nothing new but a repetition of previous stance of the Iranian
government on the Rushdie issue.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian spokesman also criticized London for allowing
Rushdie to continue to make anti-Iran remarks.
</P>
<P>
While the British foreign secretary has unequivocally stated
that the British government and the European Union countries do
not condone insults against religious sanctities, it is surprising
that Rushdie still continues his offensive remarks, Mohammadi
said.
</P>
<P>
He stated that such offensive remarks would certainly result
in further indignation among the Muslim community.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the improvement of Tehran-London ties, the
spokesman said elevation of diplomatic relations between Iran and
Britain should be assessed in the context of the world
developments and the emerging understanding about the realities of
Iran.

south Mogadishu terrified people Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses in the area said at least two militiamen are
confirmed dead and five others wounded when dozens of rival
militiamen exchanged gunfire.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the fighting is not known. However, sources
close to the militiamen said the clashes started when a convoy of
six battle wagons of local World Food Program (WFP) delivery
contractors escorting food aid to the Middle Jubba region tried
to pass by the K-7 junction on their way back.
</P>
<P>
The militiamen manning the check-point had been reportedly
annoyed by the use of the overwhelming power by the WFP food
delivery contractors on their way to the Jubba region last week.
</P>
<P>
The security on the Mogadishu-Afgoie road had become very bad
after more than 50 road blocks were erected by gangs who made the
road almost impassable by demanding huge extortion money for each
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
These road blocks have also affected the prices of the

<HEADLINE> Reported Drug Abusers in HK Continue To Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The number of drug abusers
reported to the Central Registry of Drug Abuse (CRDA) of Hong Kong
continued to drop in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to a government announcement here Sunday, drug
abusers of all ages dropped by 5.1 percent, while those aged below
21 by a much bigger 15.1 percent, compared with the first half of
1997.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, a total of 10,599 drug abusers
were reported to the CRDA, compared with 11,168 in the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
Among the reported drug abusers, newly reported abusers
accounted for 1,643, down by 15.4 percent compared with 1,942 in
the first half of 1997, and previously reported abusers totaled
8,956, down by 2.9 percent over 9,226 in the first half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Drug abusers aged below 21 totaled 1,700 in the first half of
this year, compared with 2,003 in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Commissioner for Narcotics Clarie Lo said she was pleased with
the continuing drop in reported drug abusers, especially that
involving young abusers.
</P>
<P>
"Despite this downward trend, we've not relaxed our anti-drug
efforts. On the other hand, young people remain a major target of
our preventive education and publicity programs," she noted.
</P>
<P>
On preventive education, Lo said the Narcotics Division had
improved the drug education talk for junior secondary students.
The Division was also revamping its talks for senior secondary
students.
</P>
<P>
"All these efforts are aimed at better equipping young people
with the skills to refuse drug offers, to stay away from drugs and
to understand the problems in life cannot be resolved by taking
drugs," she added.
</P>
<P>
Lo said that some publicity activities targeting young people
would take place in the next two months, including an outdoor
radio show at a shopping center, competitions on anti-drug sand
sculpture and cartoon drawing.

<HEADLINE> No End in Sight to Lesotho Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 27 (Xinhua) -- There seems to be no
end in sight to the current crisis in Lesotho as mutinous Lesotho
soldiers are likely to wage a guerrilla war against foreign
troops, which might spill over into South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Independent newspaper quoted a Lesotho opposition
party leader as saying that he feared rebels might launch
cross-border raids in their efforts to sustain their campaign.
</P>
<P>
"We must take this very seriously," Basotho National Party
leader Everestus Sekhonyane was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"They could cross the Caledon river and kill and maim on the
border farms."
</P>
<P>
He added that the opposition groups had the power to rein in
the rebels. "They believe in us and I guarantee in a week or two
we will be able to bring them back."
</P>
<P>
By Saturday afternoon, 400 more South African troops cross
into Lesotho and the South African National Defense Force was
awaiting authorization to sent more soldiers to supplement its
1,000 troops and Botswana's 200, which constitute the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) peace-keeping force.
</P>
<P>
Despite claims by the allied SADC forces that they have the
upper hand over mutinous Lesotho Defense Force (LDF) soldiers,
rebel troops have taken to the hills around the capital of Maseru
and there are fears that they will wage a guerrilla war against
the SADC force.
</P>
<P>
The foreign intervention sparked off an orgy of violence
unprecedented in Lesotho's history. Angry youths also displayed
strong anti-South African sentiments that spread to foreigners
and the media, precipitating evacuations by Maseru residents.
</P>
<P>
The capital's streets were quiet Saturday after two days of
looting earlier this week, and shoot-outs between SADC forces,
armed civilians, snipers and rebels that left at least 60 people,
including nine SADC soldiers, dead and many wounded.
</P>
<P>
But the town has come to a virtual standstill. Most remaining
South African civilians have removed their vehicle number plates
for fear of being targeted. Many have lost their livelihoods and
possessions in the orgy of arson that razed the entire central
business district of Maseru.
</P>
<P>
The town is without food and petrol, its economic
infrastructure has been devastated and damage is estimated at 100
million Rand (17 million U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
South Africa, unable to cope with the deluge of refugees, has
declared three border towns around Lesotho, including Ladybrand,
disaster areas.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand's Current Account Deficit Worsens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 27 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's current
account deficit continues to hover near record levels, according
to figures released by Statistics New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The balance of payments deficit in the year to June 1988 was
6.6 billion NZ dollars (3.3 billion U.S. dollars) or 6.7 percent
of the gross domestic product (GDP), NZ Government Statistician
Len Cook said in a media release.
</P>
<P>
This was the worst annual figure for the past 13 years ending
June.
</P>
<P>
For the second quarter of this year, the deficit reached 1.7
billion NZ dollars (8.5 billion U.S. dollars), a significant
deterioration from 584 million NZ dollars in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
The current account, also known as the balance of payments,
measures what New Zealand spends and earns in a year.
</P>
<P>
The government statistician attributed the worsening balance of
 payments to declining number of overseas visitors, slumping
exports and rising imports.
</P>
<P>
The deteriorating balance of payments and the 0.8 percent GDP
contraction in the second quarter confirm that New Zealand is in a
recession.
</P>
<P>
In view of the continued pressure on government account and the
 shrinking economy, Moody's Investor Services, an international
credit rating agency, recently downgraded New Zealand's foreign
currency bonds rating from Aa1 to Aa2.
</P>
<P>
A downgrade means the government and large companies will pay
slightly higher interest rates on money borrowed overseas, and
international investors will be less likely to invest in New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
A rating downgrade would normally mean a fall in the value of
the NZ dollar. But New Zealand's dollar had already fallen.

BAGHDAD, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Showing another sign of

the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted an Iraqi Trade Ministry source as saying

display industrial products at the fair.
</P>

Trade Under Secretary Abdul Hussein Wahaji visited Baghdad and
signed an agreement on trade cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>

First Vice President Hassan Habibi is to pay a landmark visit

country were highlights of the one-and-a-half hour program.
</P>
<P>
The show of "solidarity" was aimed at highlighting that tourism
touches everybody in one way or other.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, last year an estimated 150
million Indians traveled within the country and spent some 250
billion rupees (6.49 billion U.S. dollars) in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Tourism generates 320 billion rupees (8.31 billion U.S.

<TEXT>
<P>
The number of tourists from overseas China received every year
rose by 31.8 times during this period, while the number of the
Chinese residents traveling abroad increased by 250 percent. China
now is the sixth largest international traveler destination in the
world.
</P>
<P>
In order to promote the Chinese economy, the country has
lowered its tariffs on five occasions since 1992, with average
tariff rate dropped to 17 percent from 43.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
China has also stopped subsidizing its foreign trade companies
and adopted a unified, controlled floating exchange rate of its
currency.
</P>
<P>
It has drafted and put into force laws and regulations on
foreign trade, imports, exports, anti-dumping and anti-subsidy
issues.
</P>
<P>
China now has 160,000 companies to conduct foreign trade and do
related businesses, which enjoy the same income tax rates as other
enterprises do.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign trade and attraction of foreign investment have
maintained a sound momentum. In the past two decades, foreign
investment has gone beyond the scope of manufacturing and
construction industries to enter all principal sectors of the
economy, including agriculture, industry, transport and
telecommunications, commercial retail, catering and entertainment,
finance and insurance.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment now supports 0.5 percent of agriculture, 3.7
percent of transport and telecommunications and 3.1 percent of
retail industry in China.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the mix of export commodities has keep
improving. Manufactured goods now account for 86.9 percent of the
total exports value, as against merely 46.5 percent 20 years
ago. And machinery and electronic products has replaced textiles
as the largest export commodity.

<HEADLINE> Tourism Revenue Increases in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Both the number of foreign
tourists and tourism revenue increased in Zambia in the past
years, Tourism Minister Anoshi Chipawa said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to mark the World Tourism Day which falls on
today or September 27, he said Zambia made steady progress in
developing its tourism in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that foreign tourists increased to nearly
264,000 in 1996 from about 160,000 in 1995, a 62 percent increase
and last year the number of foreign tourists increased to nearly
341,000, a 29 percent increase over 1996.

tourism industry as strongly as manifested in the privatization
of almost all accommodation units of the country in the form of
hotels, lodges, camps and sites.
</P>
<P>
Chipawa said his "ministry will continue to cultivate a close
working relationship with private sector in the promotion of a
viable tourism sector in Zambia."

industry, providing more jobs than any other industry. Today 80
million people around the world are directly employed by the
tourism industry and another 150 million are indirectly employed
by the tourism industry.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Not to Fight Against Zimbabwe, Angola: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan troops are not
likely to fight with Zimbabwe and Angola because they are friends
of Uganda, a senior official said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Amama Mbabazi, state minister of foreign affairs in charge of
regional cooperation, made the statement when interviewed by the
New Vision paper on the crisis in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Sunday Vision quoted the official as saying that they are the
foreign forces fighting alongside with troops loyal to President
Laurent Kabila against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Kabila has no forces of his own. Some 80 percent of his entire
army rebelled against him and are with the rebels. That is why
Kabila invited foreign troops in to protect him.
</P>
<P>
However, the official warned that should the foreign army
fighting in Congo (K) do the unthinkable or should this alliance
expand and include our enemies like Sudanese who are motivated to
fight us, he said, then there will be a possibility that we can
just fight in Congo.
</P>
<P>
We have taken that possibility into consideration and are more
than prepared against such a thing, he added.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that Ugandan army is not weak in the region and
that nobody will push it out of the positions where it is.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the cost of deploying troops in Congo, he
confessed that it is costly, but prevention is better and cheaper
than cure.

<HEADLINE> S. African Lions Suffering from Bovine TB: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Lions in the Kruger
National Park, the biggest natural protection zone in South
Africa, are being threatened by an incurable and deadly bovine
tuberculosis, local daily Sunday Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In the southern area of the park, roughly 2,500 square
kilometers or one quarter of the park, more than 90 percent of
lions tested are infected with TB, and scientists said most of
them would die.
</P>
<P>
This is an area most favored by tourists for its luxury game
lodges and proximity to Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
"Lions are dying like flies," Deputy Director Johan Krige, of
the Agriculture Department was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Radical action is needed, otherwise the entire lion population
in the park could be wiped out within five to 10 years, Krige
warned.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted earlier this year showed that in
southeastern corner of the park, there were 67 lions in 1974. In
1995, numbers had dwindled to 25. In the past three years, this
has halved to 12, and scientists in the park said the most likely
cause of death is bovine tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
The most obvious manifestation of the disease is animals that
become weak and emaciated, they said.
</P>
<P>
Park officials are now facing two options: erecting a massive
fence to cut the park into two, or killing vast numbers of
animals to prevent further infection.
</P>
<P>
Peter Mokaba, deputy tourism minister, said Saturday that the
situation was so serious that South Africa might have to ask for
international help. "The impact on our economy could
devastating," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to scientists, lions have no natural resistance to
TB. They catch it from infected buffalo. But the disease has also
been diagnosed in cheetah, baboon, and kudu.

independent Palestinian state in May 1999, the Israeli government
would have to reconsider the peace process with the

<HEADLINE> New Interior Minister Nominated in Belgium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Luc van den Bossche has been
nominated Belgium's new interior minister after his predecessor
upheld his decision to resign over the death of a Nigerian woman
refugee in the process of deportation.
</P>
<P>
The nomination was made late on Saturday after Interior
Minister Louis Tobback announced that he would maintain his
decision to resign, according to local television reports on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Tobback was the second interior minister to resign within six
months for mistakes committed by the country's gendarmerie.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian cabinet met on Friday to discuss the resignation
letter handed in by Tobback following the death of 20-year-old
Semira Adamu but decided to give him 24 hours to ponder over his
decision.
</P>
<P>
Adamu died of brain hemorrhage on Tuesday in a local
hospital. The Nigerian woman became unconscious after the two
gendarmes escorting her to a Nigeria-bound flight used a cushion
to muffle her screams.
</P>
<P>
An investigation was launched into the death of Adamu and one
of the two gendarmes involved in Tuesday's incident had been found
to have been disciplined in a similar case previously.
</P>
<P>
Two other refugees died from suffocation in the process of
expulsion in Belgium in 1982 and 1987 respectively, local press
reports claimed.

<HEADLINE> Sex Workers Spy for Bombers: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Second Deputy Prime
Minister Moses Ali said that the government has uncovered a
secret link between sex workers in the capital and terrorist
bombers.
</P>
<P>
A Sunday Vision report quoted the senior official as saying
Saturday that some of the girls on Nile Avenue and other red
light districts in the city pose as prostitutes but they are
actually on reconnaissance missions against the government.
</P>
<P>
Some prostitutes are Tabiq girls deployed by a rebel or
terrorist organization to spy on government installations, he
noted. During the day they wear according to Sharia and at night
they become prostitutes but carry out clandestine activities like
spying.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the government will take measures to stop
this and will not tolerate anything resulting in insecurity.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, he addressed a congregation at Old Kampala Mosque
on the first leg of his nationwide crusade to sensitize the
Ugandan Moslem community against international terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Recent arrests cut across the board regardless of religions,
he told the large gathering.
</P>
<P>
Muruli Mukasa, the state minister for security, said Thursday
that 18 suspects have been arrested who confessed they had
planned to blow up the U.S. embassy here and some important
installations.
</P>
<P>
With the rampant spreading of terrorism in the country, the
Ugandan government has tried to curb it by mainly beefing up
security in sensitive areas and sensitizing the general public.

<HEADLINE> World Experts Laud China's Achievements in Glaciology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Some of the world's leading
glaciologists have praised their Chinese counterparts for their
great contributions to glaciology over the past four decades.
</P>
<P>
During the Sixth International Symposium on Antarctic
Glaciology which has just ended here, Dr. Jo Jacka, vice-chairman
of the International Glaciological Society, said that China now
has the edge over other countries in some aspects of glaciological
studies.
</P>
<P>
Xie Zichu, former director of the Lanzhou Institute of
Glaciology and Cryopedology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences
(CAS) and the first Chinese scientist to set foot on the Antarctic
Continent, discovered the different zones for glacial shaping,
which laid the basis for further research on that continent.
</P>
<P>
Qin Dahe, also a research fellow at the institute, located in
Gansu Province, was a member of the first Chinese expedition
to Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese experts are focusing on the study of the acme of
Dome A on the Antarctic Continent, which is regarded as very
difficult, Jacka said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the institute has made great progress in
glaciological studies of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, he said.
</P>
<P>
The convention of the international symposium in China, well
attests to the country's achievements in glaciology, J. R. Petit,
a leading French glaciologist, said.
</P>
<P>
Yao Tandong, the institute's deputy director, led an
international research group to retrieve the world's oldest ice
core, which recorded the climate and environmental changes over
the past 10,000 years in Asia.
</P>
<P>
China currently has one of the largest glaciological research
bodies in the world.

<HEADLINE> Germans Go to Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Germany's 60.5 million eligible
voters started to cast their ballots Sunday morning in the
country's last national election of this century which will decide
who will lead Europe's largest nation into the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
The election puts incumbent German Chancellor Helmut Kohl of
the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party against Gerhard
Schroeder, the chancellor candidate of the main opposition Social
Democratic Party (SPD).
</P>
<P>
It is the third all-German election after Germany's
reunification in 1990. About 3.3 million young voters will cast
their ballots for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Almost all pre-election opinion polls have pointed to a
cliffhanger vote, with Schroeder's SPD only enjoying a marginal
lead over Kohl's conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Polls will be closed at 6 p.m. local time (1600 GMT) with the
first computer projections due to be released shortly afterwards.
However, due to Germany's complex electoral system and the
possible neck-to-neck race, experts said that the first reliable
projections could only be expected after midnight.
</P>
<P>
Technically, the German chancellor is not directly elected. The
voters only elect members of the German Bundestag (lower house of
parliament).
</P>
<P>
Altogether 33 parties are contesting in the race this time, but
only four to five of them are expected to win representation in
the federal parliament.
</P>
<P>
Following the election, the chief candidate of the party with
the most votes will then be chosen as the new chancellor by the
deputies under normal circumstances.
</P>
<P>
There are 656 seats in the Bundestag, half elected by direct
votes from the country's 328 constituencies and half picked by
voters' second ballot which is cast for a list of candidates
provided by parties in the country's 16 federal states.
</P>
<P>
However, more seats could be added if parties won more direct
mandates from the first ballot than from the second one, which
determines the percentage of seats for a party in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
This complex system tends to favor a coalition government,
which is the norm in Germany's post-war history.
</P>
<P>
Kohl's current center-right ruling coalition, consisting of his
CDU, its Bavarian sister party Christian Social Union (CSU) as
well as the junior partner Free Democratic Party (FDP), says that
they would keep the current alliance.
</P>
<P>
On the other side, the leftist SPD is campaigning to come to
power in Bonn, after 16 years in opposition, in alliance with the
ecologist Greens.
</P>
<P>
If neither group could muster a parliamentary majority, as
recent polls indicated, the only option would be a so-called grand
coalition between the two biggest parties, the CDU and the SPD,
with the chancellor post going to the party with the most votes.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder has said that he is willing to lead such a grand
coalition. But Kohl has said repeatedly that he wants no part of
that even when his CDU comes out ahead. That would open the door
to Kohl's preferred successor and CDU's parliamentary leader,
Wolfgang Schaeuble to take over as chancellor.
</P>
<P>
Whoever emerges as Germany's next chancellor, he will be
charged with the task of leading a country that will take over the
rotating presidencies of both the European Union (EU) and the
Group of Seven (G-7) western industrialized nations from January 1
next year and will join 10 other EU countries to launch the single
European currency, the euro, on the same date.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Trade Deficit Reaches 1.65 Billion U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 27 (Xinhua) -- During the first nine months
this year, Vietnam's exports increased 4.1 percent to 6.93 billion
U.S. dollars, while imports decreased 0.3 percent from the same
period last year, the Vietnam News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
During the said period, the country's trade deficit was 1.65
billion U.S. dollars, said the agency in a report.
</P>
<P>
During the nine months, Vietnam sold abroad over 8.6 million
tons of crude oil, the country's top export item, representing a
21 percent rise from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the price of exported crude oil dropped by between 30
percent to 40 percent compared to 1997's average. As a result, the
value of oil exports fell despite increased quantity.
</P>
<P>
Exports of many agricultural products also dropped because of
prolonged natural calamities since late 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Trade Ministry said that it found it difficult to reach
this year's export growth target of 10 percent, which had been
revised down from the previous 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government has taken measures to boost exports,
such as setting up an export award fund and reducing interest
rates for export-oriented businesses.

"We want to be the generation that wins the war on cancer,"

<HEADLINE> Southwest China Iron, Steel Base Absorbs More Investment (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Ertan Hydropower Plant,
expected to be China's largest power plant built in the 20th
century, has gone into commercial operation.
</P>
<P>
However, the plant takes advantage of less than one third of
the hydropower resources of the Panzhihua-Xichang Region in
southwestern Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
Covering an area of 67,000 sq km and taking Panzhihua and
Xichang as its central cities, the Panzhihua-Xichang region has
become a new hot spot for domestic and overseas investment because
of its abundant natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Apart from its water resources, which are the richest in the
country, the region also abounds in deposits of iron, vanadium and
titanium, which account for 13, 69 and 93 percent, respectively,
of the country's totals.
</P>
<P>
According to Xie Hong, director of the office in charge of the
exploitation of local natural resources, more than 260 Chinese and
foreign investors have so far poured approximately two billion
U.S. dollars into the region since 1990, with another 50 or 60
billion yuan (6.04 billion to 7.25 billion US dollars) from
governments at different levels.
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1960s, large-scale exploration work started in the
southwest region to turn Panzhihua into western China's largest
iron and steel industrial base and Xichang into a satellite
launching center.
</P>
<P>
The area has witnessed not only rapid progress in
infrastructure construction, but also high returns on various
types of investment, according to Sun Honglie, a noted economist
as well as an academician with the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Sun said the ratio of investment and corresponding pre-tax
profit in the region was 1 to 0.7 in the 25 years from 1965 to
1990, 1.5 times higher than the national average.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, an international banking group comprising 24 foreign
banks from the United States, Japan, Britain and other countries
and regions reaped some 86 million U.S. dollars-worth of profit
from their 200-million-U.S.dollar syndicated loans, which further
boosted investors' confidence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the central government promised an annual input of
more than 30 million yuan (3.6 million US dollars), beginning in
1996, into the region to boost the exploration of natural
resources.
</P>
<P>
Aside from the Ertan Hydropower Plant, which has already drawn
1.2 billion U.S. dollars-worth of investment from the World Bank,
four other such hydroelectic power plants at state-level are
expected to start construction soon, with a combined capacity of
25.5 million kw.
</P>
<P>
All these are part of China's effort to narrow the disparities
between the coastal area and central-western region, which will
provide the Panzhihua-Xichang Region with great opportunities for
development, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century, these key projects in the region
completed or scheduled in near future will create a huge market
demand, and thus provide more ideal opportunities for business
people from both at home and abroad, Sun predicted.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Bank Backs Attack on U.S. Embassy: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 27 (Xinhua) -- A Dar es Salaam-based
bank has allegedly played an important role in financing
terrorists who bombed the United States embassy in Tanzania,
local newspaper Sunday Observer revealed.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Ministry of Home Affairs sources as saying
that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents and police
in Tanzania are probing the bank, which is said to have received
big sum of money from abroad for payment to suspects before the
August 7 bomb blast.
</P>
<P>
The blast, caused by a bomb planted under a water tanker,
killed 11 people and leaving 74 others injured. Two suspects in
connection with the incident have been arraigned before the
Kisutu Resident's Magistrate Court in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The payments were either in cash or by checks, and
investigators have intercepted several check leaves and are
examining them, according to the paper, which did not disclose the
name of the bank.
</P>
<P>
The bank will be closed down and people involved will be
charged for murder if the allegations are proven, it said.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary investigations have also shown that the bank was
used to deposit large amount of money for a sister bank in the
Kenyan capital of Nairobi, where a similar bombing killed more
than 250 people and injured over 5,000 others.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Florence Griffith Joyner
was remembered as a great Olympic champion Saturday at a two-hour
funeral at Saddleback Community Church in California, the United
States.
</P>
<P>
With an Olympic flag haning behind her casket, the world
fastest female sprinter in history who set 200 meters world
records in the 1988 Seoul Olympics, was honored as ran a race
faithfully won.
</P>
<P>
All the attendents showed a mix of affection and anger over
accusations that Griffith Joyner's records were aided by banned
drugs.
</P>
<P>
"She stopped by to tell you all those jealous, venomous words
can't harm me no more," her former coach Bob Kersee shouted from
a podium above Griffith Joyner's coffin.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,500 mourner, including Olympians Bruce Jenner,
Gail Devers, Kevin Young, Willie Gault, Johnny Gray were among
those at the funeral service.
</P>
<P>
Griffith Joyner, who won three gold medals in 1988 Olympics,
denied using performance-enhancing drugs and never failed a drug
test. Her sudden death at age 38 brought rumors out about
possible drug use. The case of death has not been determined.
</P>
<P>
"I've heard a whole lot of bad things, but I don't hear too
many people saying what they've done wrong, what's hindering
their performance," said Kersee, whose wife, Olympic heptathlon
gold medalist Jackie Joyner-Kersee, is the brother of Al Joyner,
Griffith Joyner's husband.
</P>
<P>
Kersee told Mary Joyner, the 7-year-old daughter of Griffith
Joyner "Mary, your momma wants you to know that those tarnishing,
poisonous lies can't hurt her no more. So you don't have to worry
about that venomous, deadly scorpion sting of the reporters. It
don't hurt her no more. See God is protecting her. See God is her
coach now."
</P>
<P>
Al Joyner addressed his wife's casket with his voice cracking
and tears in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
"I keep asking myself why did this happen," he said. "One
thing about Florence Griffith Joyner that not everybody saw was
she gave unconditional love. She was my dream. I stayed focused
on her for seven years until she looked my way."
</P>
<P>
Joyner also asked his daughter Mary to sing a song to her late
mother. People gave a standing ovation when the girl sang "When
Wind Blew on Me."
</P>
<P>
William Hybl, president of the U.S. Olympic Committee, and
Anita De Frantz, vice president of the International Olympic
Committee, hailed Griffith Joyner's kindness and will to
succeed.

PANAMA CITY, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The termination of

</P>
<P>
National Movement for Sovereignty Defense leader Genaro Lopez

"The MCC failure has been a victory for the Panamanian people,"
said the leader of the movement, which is made up by some 50
labor, farmers and students unions.
</P>
<P>
Former Panamanian president Jorge Illueca said that the
Panamanian government had no other choice but to declare the MCC
negotiations terminated on Thursday, because the United States
intended to turn Panama into a "big military base."
</P>

The Panama Canal Torrijos-Carter treaties singed in 1997
require the departure of American soldiers by December 31, 1999,

<HEADLINE> Swiss Reinsurance Group Sees Potential of Investment Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- China's fixed assets
investment plan will result in great opportunities for the Swiss
Reinsurance Group (Swiss Re), today's China Daily quotes the
company's chief executive officer Waler B. Kielholz as saying.
</P>
<P>
The investment will create demand for huge amounts of machinery
and equipment, which will need to be insured.
</P>
<P>
"But the insurance market in China is not in a position to
cover all these demands," he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Chinese insurance companies will seek financial
support from the world reinsurance market to ensure economic
stability.
</P>
<P>
Company chairman Ulrich Bremi said Swiss Re has been
paying great attention to its development in the China market.
</P>
<P>
To show its confidence and commitment to China, Swiss Re last
week held a group executive meeting in Shanghai attended by 120
senior officials.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time Swiss Re had held such a meeting
outside Europe since its founding in 1863.
</P>
<P>
Bremi said the meeting in Shanghai was aimed to let senior
officials better understand the changes and potential in China,
which will have a huge influence on the company's strategy.
</P>
<P>
"Our commitment in China is for the long term and will not be
influenced by the regional financial crisis," he said.

<HEADLINE> Thai Airways Advised to Scrap Aircraft Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Smith Thammasarote, deputy permanent secretary for transport
and communications, said the order for the three aircraft -- one
Airbus 330 and two Boeing 777-300s -- could be canceled because
their construction had not started yet, Sunday's Bangkok Post
reported.
</P>
<P>
Smith heads a committee studying TAI's aircraft procurement
worth over 14 billion baht (364 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The manufacturers should have no problem with the cancellation
and should refund the deposit because the TAI is a good customer,
he said, adding that if the manufacturers proceed with the
construction and the airways refuses to buy, it will be difficult
to find another customer for the aircraft designed for TAI.
</P>
<P>
The national airline has placed a deposit of 148 million
dollars for the aircraft and is required to pay another 216
million dollars to complete the deal.
</P>
<P>
Smith said his committee would forward its proposal to
Transport and Communications Minister Suthep Thueksuban next
Monday for approval.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was in line with the ministry's policy to have
TAI's aircraft procurement plan reviewed to save national
expenses, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
If Boeing and Airbus rejected the proposal, TAI should
negotiate for changing aircraft types or for extending the
schedule for their delivery, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, TAI was making another negotiation with Airbus
Industrie to change a purchase contract for five Airbus 300-600s
into an 11-year lease deal, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
The five aircraft were already completed but TAI had yet to
find a budget to pay for their delivery, according to Smith.
</P>
<P>
TAI has already paid 9 million dollars in fine plus interest
for having the delivery delayed.
</P>
<P>
Smith said TAI should buy the five aircraft if it could raise
enough money.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Equities overcame initial
hesitancy after receiving gradual and good support mid-week
onwards and moved widely in brisk activity on the Bombay Stock
Exchange (BSE) market during the week.
</P>
<P>
The BSE sensitive index spurted by 132.85 points to end the
week at 3223.57 as against last weekend's close of 3090.72. The
national index gained 52.50 points to 1424.72 at the weekend from
the previous close of 1372.22. The BSE-200 and U.S. dollar index
were quoted sharply up at 329.28 and 128.96 at the weekend
compared with last weekend close of 317.37 and 124.24
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Operators attributed the rising equities to the agreement
reached by Indo-Pak prime ministers in New York on September 23 to
resume the two countries' dialogue from next month as well as a
sharp upsurge in Wall Street and U.K. stock which have boosted the
sentiment on Southeast Asian markets.

BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Five banks in Guangdong
Province were deprived of the right to run foreign exchange
business or had their right to sell foreign exchange suspended for
six months to a year recently, says today's China Daily.

<HEADLINE> Italian President Optimistic About Avoiding Government Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Italian President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro said in Pescara Saturday that there were reasons to hope
that a government crisis over the 1999 budget could be averted.
</P>
<P>
After a speech which reiterated recent calls for political
sacrifices for the "common good," Scalfaro was asked how he viewed
the current stand-off between the government and its some time
ally Communist Refoundation.
</P>
<P>
"There are no certainties, but a motivated, serious and serene
optimism," he said. "When I make a call, if I didn't have any hope,
I wouldn't make it at all," he added when asked how hopeful he was
of a solution being found.
</P>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi Friday unveiled a 1999
budget that went much farther than expected in allotting cash for
social policies, a move he said was designed to woo the left ally
back into the fold.
</P>
<P>
"I wonder how Communist Refoundation can still justify not
voting for this budget?" the prime minister told reporters.
</P>
<P>
But the 14.7 trillion lire (8.6 billion U.S. dollars) package,
containing an extra 1.2 trillion (706 million dollars) for the
worse-off, still failed to win the support of Fausto Bertinotti,
leader of the Communist Refoundation.
</P>
<P>
Italian Communist Refoundation's final decision on the budget
bill is expected to come at a party's conference on October 3 and
4.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Approves Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
Representatives passed an 80 billion U.S. dollar Republican tax
cut bill by a 229-195 vote in a unusual session held Saturday.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton immediately renewed his threat to veto
the election-year bill because it would spend a small part of the
1.6 trillion dollar budget surplus forecast over the next decade
instead of holding all of it until Social Security is safeguarded.
</P>
<P>
"I will insist that we reserve the entire surplus until we have
seized this historic opportunity to save Social Security, and veto
any bill that doesn't meet that principle," Clinton stated during
his fund-raising trip to California.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which totals 80 billion dollars over five years,
would benefit married couples, farmers, small business operators,
working senior citizens, people with modest savings accounts and
students saving for private colleges.
</P>
<P>
It also would extend several expiring tax credits sought by big
business and would allow school districts to keep more bond
proceeds for construction.
</P>
<P>
According to the bill, more than half the tax cuts would go to
families with incomes under 75,000 dollars, according to the Joint
Committee on Taxation.
</P>
<P>
The main sponsor, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill
Archer, said the bill would continue to reverse four decades of
Democratic control of Congress that ended in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Thailand, Myanmar Hold Border Trade Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and Myanmar have
worked out a blueprint for border trade liberalization which aims
at boosting commercial ties between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
A meeting between the two sides was held last week in northern
Thailand's Tak province, at which a proposal to establish a free
industrial zone in Myanmar was discussed, Sunday's Bangkok Post
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, industrial plants will be built in the zone and
supplied with raw materials and labor from Myanmar. This is
expected to attract Myanmar workers who would otherwise cross into
Thailand to seek jobs.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, head of the Thai team, Deputy Commerce
Minister Pothipong Lamsam, asked Myanmar to lift its ban on
exports of some goods, such as gem stones, seafood and some
livestock animals.
</P>
<P>
He was also keen to have Myanmar's permission for land travel
on a 400-kilometer route linking Thailand's border with Myanmar's
capital to promote tourism.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, his Myanmar counterpart, Myo Tint, said the Myanmar
government had considered easing its restrictions on the export of
artificial flowers, seafood and fresh-water fishery products.
</P>
<P>
However, he said his country would not allow exports of
buffaloes or cows for fear of shortages at home.
</P>
<P>
He added that Thai investors were welcome to participate in the
semiannual bidding for state concessions to mine for and to trade
in gem stones.

<HEADLINE> China Plans to Re-organize Foreign-funded Retail Ventures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to issue a
special regulation governing the opening of the retail sector
after a reorganization of 277 Sino-foreign commercial joint
ventures, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
He Ju, director general of the foreign investment
administration department of the State Development Planning
Commission (SDPC), was quoted as saying that China is to open up
its retail sector gradually, allowing pilot joint ventures in more
cities and lower market access restrictions for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
But he said this will not take place until the completion of the
reorganization of 277 foreign-funded commercial joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
Only the State Council is empowered to approve pilot joint
ventures, but some local governments have overstepped their
authority by approving a number of such enterprises, according to
the official.
</P>
<P>
Given the surfeit of commercial firms in urban areas, this has
worsened the commercial environment and led to unfair competition
in big cities, he said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the re-organization drive started last
year and is scheduled to finish by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Those firms subject to the reorganization will be allowed to
continue operations if promised foreign investment has
materialized and the firms have sound management, pass annual
inspections and do not engage in wholesale business, he noted.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, Chinese partners should hold at least 50
percent of the shares in retail joint ventures. The share-holding
requirement can be as low as 40 percent in the country's central
and western regions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in chain stores or warehouse-style stores, Chinese
partners must hold a majority of the joint venture shares. The
Sino-foreign partnership can be as long as 30 years in coastal
regions and 40 years in central and western regions, the
director-general said.
</P>
<P>
Regulations on the opening up of the retail sector were
announced in 1992, when the government decided to allow pilot
commercial joint ventures in 12 cities.

LA PAZ, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Bolivian government will
auction all its telecommunications services next year, a Bolivian

Although the monopoly of the telecommunications will end on

services can be auctioned in advance and the new owners will start
operating on November 28, 2001, Arce said.

He said that the telecommunications services include satellite
television, digital radio, video conferences and mobile phones.

<HEADLINE> Petrol Consumption Tax to Replace Road Fee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to take the
first step in its drive to turn administrative fees into tax items
in early 1999, when a petrol and diesel consumption tax will
replace the traditional road maintenance fee, according to a key
member of a government think-tank under the Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
The tax will be added at the pump, today's China Daily quoted
Jia Kang, deputy director of the ministry's Institute for Fiscal
Science, as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, non-government toll highways are likely to be
permitted to continue collecting tolls. This will enable investors
to get their proper returns, he said.
</P>
<P>
The road maintenance fee is charged by communications
authorities on every motor vehicle in service.
</P>
<P>
The fee, which is supposed to be used to maintain roads built
by the government, is among thousands of charges levied by
governments at different levels. The levies constitute the prime
source of so-called "off-budget" revenues.
</P>
<P>
The gasoline tax represents part of the government's ongoing
efforts to stamp out illegal charges and fiscalize the necessary
ones for better management of its revenues.

<P>
TIRANA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Seven southeast European
countries agreed Saturday to establish a peace-keeping force for
southeast Europe, the Macedonia News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Defense Ministers of Macedonia, Albania, Bulgaria, Greece,
Italy, Romania and Turkey signed an agreement Saturday in Skoplje,
capital of Macedonia, to establish the peace-keeping force at
their third annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the peace-keeping force will have
11 mechanized companies and three infantry companies with 3,000
to 4,000 troops from the seven countries.
</P>
<P>
But the location of the headquarters has not been decided due
to differences of opinions.
</P>
<P>
The main task of the force is to take part in peace-keeping
actions of North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the West European
Union and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia will send about 150 troops to join the force, the
news agency said.

<HEADLINE> Valley Attracts Scientists to Rare Plant Species </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Wild Flower Valley, an outlying
mountainous place in central China's Hubei Province, is rarely
known to outsiders, but in recent years it has become increasingly
attractive to scientists.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1990s, Chinese scientists discovered more than 20
rare plant species including wild wintersweet, wild peonies and
Chinese yews in this Baokang County valley in western Hubei.
</P>
<P>
The 20-km-long valley is part of the Jingshan Mountain Range,
which was formed in remote geological ages and retain many of its
ancient features.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the natural landscape has remained virtually
unchanged for millions of years, with a great many rare plant
species preserved, making Baokang a "biological gene bank'"
</P>
<P>
Almost half of the wild peony species so far found in the world
can be found here, and there are more than 100,000 wild peony
trees in the area, covering about 167 hectares.
</P>
<P>
There are 11 varieties of Chinese yews in the world, five in
all of China and two in Baokang. A total of 50,000 Chinese yews
are in the valley covering an area of 2,000 hectares. The Chinese
yew is used as a herbal medicine in helping treat tumors,
including a few cancers like lung cancer and ovary cancer, and its
extract can sell as much as for some one million U.S. dollars per
kilogram.
</P>
<P>
The valley is also called the "kingdom of wintersweet" by the
local people. There are 800 hectares of wild wintersweet in the
valley whose heights range from 4 to 10 meters, much
taller than scientists had ever seen before.
</P>
<P>
The largest one is 110 years old, 13.5 meters high and
0.27 meters around.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some 100 varieties of rare wildlife live in the
valley including antelopes, masked civets and wild boars.

<HEADLINE> Hide Retains WBO Heavyweight Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Herbie Hide
retained his World Boxing Organisation (WBO) heavyweight title in
Norwich, England, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The referee, Joe Cortez, stepped in to stop Hide's defence
against Willi Fischer in the second round of a scheduled
twelve-round contest after a flurry of explosive punches had
floored the German challenger three times.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old British fighter took charge from the start and
Fischer could not cope with Hide's power and speed.
</P>
<P>
He first fell early in the second round to a big left, and
after going down again for a mandatory eight count, the final
result was never in doubt. When another punishing left from Hide
sent Fischer crashing back to the canvas the referee wisely
called a halt.

<P>
STOCKHOLM, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Sweden
overwhelmed Spain 3-0 in the World Group semi-finals to advance
to the Davis Cup final on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
After winning two tough opening singles, Swedish pair Jonas
Bjorkman and Nicklas Kulti defeated Spain's Javier Sanchez and
Julian Alonswon in three straight sets, 6-2, 6-2, 6-2 at the
Royal Tennis Hall here.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's lopsided win gave Sweden an unbeatable 3-0
advantage in the best-of-five match semi-final.
</P>
<P>
Bjorkman gave Sweden a 1-0 lead on Friday with a 6-3, 7-5, 6-7
(5-7), 6-3 victory over Alex Corretja.
</P>
<P>
Sweden's Thomas Johansson had a dream debut in the second
singles match, edging Carlos Moya of Spain 7-5, 7-6 (7-4), 7-6
(8-6).
</P>
<P>
Sunday's reverse singles are likely to be shortened to
best-of-3 sets. Bjorkman is scheduled to start against Moya in a
match between the team's No. 1 selections.
</P>
<P>
Sweden has played 11 finals since its first victory at the
Royal Tennis Hall in 1975, when former great Bjorn Borg anchored
the team. With its six wins and five runners-up finishes, Sweden
is the most successful Davis Cup nation in the last two decades.

<HEADLINE> Villa Win Top Clash but Sending-off Dominates Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Aston Villa won the English
premier league's top-of-the-table clash with a 1-0 win over Derby
County on Saturday but the day's action was dominated by one of
the most spectacular sending-offs in Britain for years.
</P>
<P>
Sheffield Wednesday's Italian striker Paolo di Canio floored
referee Paul Alcock seconds after being shown the red card for
violent conduct in his team's 1-0 victory over reigning champions
Arsenal.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal's Martin Keown was also sent off after the mass brawl
on the pitch. But di Canio's aggressive shove on Alcock is likely
to end in a tough sanction from English soccer authorities and
dominate the headlines.
</P>
<P>
England international Paul Merson, a recent signing from
Middlesbrough, helped Villa stay on top of the table with a
well-taken 15th minute goal in the crucial Midlands derby at
Villa Park.
</P>
<P>
After beating the Derby offside trap, Merson sprinted down the
middle of the pitch and slotted the ball just inside the
left-hand post.

<HEADLINE> Germany Braces for General Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Tense atmosphere hung overall in
Germany on Saturday as voters prepared for the last national
election of this century which will decide who will lead Europe's
largest nation into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The election will put the incumbent German chancellor Helmut
Kohl of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party against a
political fresh face, Gerhard Schroeder, from the main opposition
Social Democratic Party (SPD).
</P>
<P>
Almost all opinion polls have pointed to a cliffhanger vote
with Schroeder, premier of Germany's Lower Saxony state and SPD's
chancellor candidate, only enjoying a marginal lead over Kohl, who
has been German chancellor since 1982.
</P>
<P>
Technically, the German chancellor is not directly elected. The
country's 60.5 million eligible voters will on Sunday elect
members of the German Bundestag (lower house of parliament).
</P>
<P>
Following the election, the chief candidate of the party with
most votes will then be chosen as the new chancellor by the
deputies under normal circumstances.
</P>
<P>
There are 656 seats in the Bundestag, half elected by direct
votes from the country's 328 constituencies and half picked by
voters' second ballot which is cast for a list of candidates
provided by parties in the country's 16 federal states.
</P>
<P>
However, more seats could be added if parties won more direct
mandates from the first ballot than from the second one, which
determines the percentage of seats for a party in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
This complex system tends to favor a coalition government as
was the case in most of Germany's post-war history.
</P>
<P>
Kohl's current center-right ruling coalition, consisting of his
CDU, its Bavarian sister party Christian Social Union (CSU) as
well as the junior partner Free Democratic Party (FDP), says that
they would keep the current alliance.
</P>
<P>
On the other side, the leftist SPD is campaigning to come to
power in Bonn, after 16 years in opposition, in alliance with the
ecologist Greens.
</P>
<P>
If neither group could muster a parliamentary majority, as
recent polls indicated, the only option would be a so-called grand
coalition between the two biggest parties, the CDU and the SPD,
with the chancellor post going to the party with most votes.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder has said that he is willing to lead such a grand
coalition. But Kohl has said repeatedly that he wants no part of
that even when his CDU comes out ahead. That would open the door
to Kohl's preferred successor and the CDU's parliamentary leader,
Wolfgang Schaeuble to take over as chancellor.
</P>
<P>
Whoever might emerge as Germany's next chancellor, he will be
charged with the task to lead a country that will take over the
rotating presidencies of both the European Union (EU) and the
Group of Seven (G-7) western industrialized nations up from
January 1 next year and will join ten other EU countries to launch
the single European currency, the euro, on the same date.

<HEADLINE> New Drug Approved for Advanced Breast Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- A new drug named Herceptin
has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for
the treatment of advanced breast cancer, according to a report from
Saturday's Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
Herceptin, made by California-based Genetech Inc. is the first
"monoclonal antibody" to be approved for the treatment of breast
cancer. It is transfused into the body and then binds to a protein
called HER2. The protein is found on the surface of some normal
cells and plays a role in regulating cell growth. Some tumors make
too much HER2. In clinical trials, the drug stunted growth of
those tumors.
</P>
<P>
Two clinical trials showed Herceptin's effectiveness. In one
study involving 469 patients, women she received the drug along
with chemotherapy had less rapid tumor growth, more tumors that
were reduced in size by 50 percent or more and a higher rate of
survival one year past treatment.
</P>
<P>
Forty-four percent of Herceptin users responded to treatment,
compared with 29 percent in the group receiving chemotherapy
alone; the one-year survival rate with Herceptin was 79 percent,
compared with 68 percent for chemotherapy alone.

<P>
KHARTOUM, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Sudan has submitted a
memorandum to the U.N. Security Council to complain about the
U.S. recent threats of new strikes against Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of Sudanese Foreign Relations Ministry Hassan Abdin
told reporters Saturday that the memorandum called on the Security
Council to use its authority to prevent the U.S. from persistence in
violating the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
"The recent U.S. threats are of a flagrant and open breach of the
U.N. Charter that bans use, or threats of using, force, thus
showing the seriousness of the situation and the ill-will of the
United States," he said.
</P>
<P>
The threats endangered regional security and raised concern
and panic among people of the region, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Sudan said it has received a memorandum from the U.S. permanent
representative to the U.N., which threatened that the U.S. will launch
new military strikes against Sudan in case any U.S. citizen or interest
worldwide falls under any attack.
</P>
<P>
Washington, which has repeatedly accused Sudan of practicing
and harboring terrorism, launched a missile attack on a
pharmaceutical factory last month in retaliation for the bombings on
August 7 of its embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Sudan also sent the memorandum to the Arab League, the
Organization of African Unity and the Non-Aligned Movement, Abdin
said.

JERUSALEM -- An Israeli Defense Ministry adviser has said that
Israel is developing a new defense and attack system that can
destroy missiles after they are launched from hostile neighbors,
Israel Radio reported Saturday.

The adviser, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did not
elaborate on the new system, only saying that the size of the
missile system is similar to that of the Arrow anti-missile
missile, the radio reported.

A more advanced system is needed as more advanced offensive
missiles are obtained by Israel's bitter rivals Iran, Iraq and
Syria, they said. (BC-Israel-New Missile)
