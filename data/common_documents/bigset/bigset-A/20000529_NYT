FUJIMORI THE VICTOR IN RUNOFF ELECTION; PROTESTERS TAKE TO THE
STREETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS 5th graf with info more protests; SUBS 6th graf with 5 grafs
on Toledo's speech)

<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ In a runoff vote long on protest but short on
suspense, President Alberto Fujimori swept to victory Sunday
against an opponent who had urged his supporters to abstain because
of what he called vote fraud and an array of campaign
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori had hoped for a third landslide victory that would
venerate his successes defeating two terrorist groups and
hyperinflation and making peace with Ecuador after decades of
border tensions. Instead, the 61-year-old leader won a hollow
victory leaving the country badly polarized and facing possible
economic sanctions just as it tries to emerge from recession.
</P>
<P>
   The balloting capped a campaign full of dirty tricks, violent
demonstrations and condemnations from Fujimori's opponent,
Alejandro Toledo, who withdrew on May 18 _ too late to pull his
name off the ballot. The Clinton administration, France, Britain,
Canada, Argentina and Costa Rica echoed Toledo's criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   Even before voting drew to a close, demonstrations grew more
intense and downtown Lima was filled with the pungent smell of tear
gas. Government helicopters buzzed overhead as a crowd of some tens
of thousands of demonstrators assembled Sunday night. That scene
was played out in cities across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the enthusiastic, L chanting crowd, in which many
were carrying lit candles, Toledo said he planned to lead a
non-stop, nation- wide movement to nullify the elec- tion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dictatorship degrades people,'' the 54-year-old U.S.-trained L
business professor said. ``It silences people. Dictatorship is the
impotence of reason that brings repression.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to mobilize people across Peru peacefully,'' said
Toledo, standing in blue jeans and a button-down shirt on a
platform overlooking one of Lima's main pla- zas.
</P>
<P>
   In a particularly provocative ges- ture, Toledo introduced a
retired general, Francisco Morales Bermu-H dez, who was the last
military presi- dent of Peru, to speak to the crowd. ``I've read
many chapters of the his- tory of Peru,'' said the general, who
ruled Peru in the late 1970s, ``but I have never seen such a
shameful thing as this election in the history of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   With virtually all of the vote count- ed, Fujimori had 50.8
percent while Toledo had 16.7 percent, with the rest of the ballots
left blank or nullified.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of American States released a report last week
saying, ``the Peruvian electoral process is far from one that could
be considered free and fair,'' noting that government funding was
used in the Fujimori campaign, media access was dominated by the
president, and that there was not enough time to inspect new
computer vote tabulation software to assure a fair count.
</P>
<P>
   Before a single vote was cast, election observers from the
Organization of American States and the Carter Center, based in
Atlanta, had withdrawn in disgust after they failed to persuade the
government to postpone the election. Toledo, the only challenger on
the ballot, did not vote and told reporters the election was as
``fraudulent as a soccer game in which the field is tilted and one
side chooses the referees and the reporters who cover the
contest.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's bid for a third term has stirred opposition here ever
since Congress fired three judges more than two years ago for
ruling that a constitutional ban on a third presidential term
prohibited the president from running. Fujimori argued that he
could run since the constitution was written after his first term,
meaning the ban would only apply if he ran for a fourth term.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters appeared to be going through the motion of voting in
an election that lacked drama after Toledo pulled out 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no institution in this country that is free
anymore,'' said Enrique Fernandez, a 48-year-old folk music
promoter, before voting in the working-class neighborhood of Rimac
in order to avoid a $35 fine for not voting or problems with the
police. ``The Justice Ministry and election authorities are totally
controlled and this is all a fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo, a 54-year-old business professor who was educated in the
United States, insisted that Sunday's uncontested election would
hurl Peru into uncharted, turbulent political currents. Once
re-elected to a third term, he said, Fujimori ``will be a permanent
source of political instability that will have permanent economic
consequences. I can assure you he will not last very long.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Toledo predicted that protests around the country will
gather momentum. There have already been strikes and road blockades
in the cities of Iquitos, Cuzco and Chiclayo in recent days, as
well as several violent incidents in Lima, including rock and
firebomb attacks by university students on the presidential palace
itself.
</P>
<P>
   The tainted Peruvian election will dominate a meeting of foreign
ministers of the countries belonging to the Organization of
American States scheduled to meet in Canada this week. The
ministers could ultimately decide on sanctions, although in the
past severe action has been taken only in cases of coup d'etats or
other overt interruptions of democratic process.
</P>
<P>
   It is more likely sanctions will come from the United States,
where Congress has already passed a joint resolution calling for a
review of all political, economic and military relations with Peru.
Still, it remains doubtful Washington will cut deeply into
assistance that goes toward Peru's efforts at combating terrorism
and narcotics trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration pushed hard for Fujimori to hold a
second-round vote during a questionable slow count in the days
following the first-round of balloting on April 9. But in recent
weeks Washington has softened its criticism of Peru and allowed the
Organization of American States, a usually cautious regional
organization, to take the lead in pushing for democratic reform
here.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, President Clinton had strong words for Peru on
Friday, the day after election authorities had already decided to
go ahead with vote. ``Free, fair and open elections are the
foundation of a democratic society,'' he said. ``Without them, our
relationship with Peru inevitably will be affected.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori is counting on the United States to go easy on him,
rather than jeopardize the cooperation of the two countries in
economic, anti-terrorism and especially anti-drug programs that
have halved this country's coca plant production in the last five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be terrible if our anti-narcotics collaboration was
upset and we will continue to welcome U.S. investment,'' Fujimori
said. ``These are elements in our relations that will supersede
whatever tensions arise from the election.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori used an assortment of sweet carrots and rather sharp
sticks on his way to a third five-year term.
</P>
<P>
   In a wave of populism, he raised the minimum wage and handed out
land titles to 150,000 peasants during the campaign. But Fujimori
was also besieged by criticism from international election
observers for a range of campaign irregularities. Poor mothers
dependent on government milk and food handouts were pressured to
attend Fujimori rallies, for example, and intelligence agents
followed and harassed opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Many tabloid newspapers that have connections to Fujimori's
intelligence service and all television networks save for one cable
television station either did not cover the Toledo campaign or
tilted their coverage toward salacious and unproved allegations of
financial fraud, sexual innuendo and claims that he had an
illegitimate daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, a journalist who said he had videotapes showing
Fujimori's intelligence chief meeting with election officials was
assaulted by three unidentified men. From a hospital bed, he said
the assailants cut his wrist to the bone with a saw as they
demanded he disclose his sources inside the intelligence agency.
</P>
<P>
   In the hours following the April 9 vote, cries of fraud arose
when ballots and tally sheets disappeared for several hours.
Election authorities only announced that Fujimori did not receive
the required majority to avert a second round after three days of
heavy international pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo ran a strong race in the April first round, promising to
give the poor jobs and to disentangle the courts and congress from
the tight grip of presidential control.
</P>
<P>
   But he appeared to fumble badly when he suddenly sought to drop
out of the race 10 days ago, claiming that he was not willing to
lead his supporters into a fraudulent vote unless the election date
was postponed several weeks to give international observers an
opportunity to audit computer software designed to count ballots.
</P>
<P>
   He slid in a variety of opinion polls, as voters either
expressed disappointment in his apparent surrender or dismay that
he was willing to incite unrest and damage the image of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   A poll conducted by Datum Internacional between May 19 and 22,
which only the week before had shown a virtual tie between the two
candidates, showed that 55 percent of voters disapproved of
Toledo's decision to drop out of the race. The poll also showed
Fujimori leading Toledo by a 54-46 percent margin, suggesting that
Fujimori could win a clean, free election anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo's argument that he was a victim of fraud was also hurt by
public criticism levied at him by the head of the observation team
from the Organization American States, who said Toledo's
oscillating position on conditions for competing in the runoff made
it more difficult to negotiate a delay in the election date.

PUT RUSH LIMBAUGH IN `MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL' BOOTH? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that the network season proper is over and summer's (almost)
here, a TV critic's mind turns to ... football.
</P>
<P>
   Until Wednesday, anyway, when CBS launches ``Survivor.'' In the
meantime, I was thinking about how - and it kills me to say this -
Rush Limbaugh might not be such a terrible choice for the ``Monday
Night Football'' booth.
</P>
<P>
   (SLAP!)
</P>
<P>
   Ouch. Had to smack myself for even thinking it. Anyway, the
talk-radio king says he auditioned for the job last week (ABC
doesn't confirm this, but doesn't deny it, either). Good for him.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he's a blowhard; yes, he's infuriating; yes, his views are
often so offensive that you want to pull the car over and yank out
the radio and hurl it into the river. (This would be more
satisfying if Arizona rivers had water in them.)
</P>
<P>
   All of which is why Limbaugh would be, if not exactly a good
pick, at least an intriguing one. People would tune in just to get
ticked off, and when's the last time that happened?
</P>
<P>
   Easy: Howard Cosell's last broadcast. ABC's sports bigwigs have
said this is the kind of juice they want to return to the booth,
juice that's been missing ever since the days of the Mouth That
Roared.
</P>
<P>
   How strong were the feelings Cosell stirred? Forget the
well-worn anecdote that a 1978 ``TV Guide'' poll named him both the
nation's most-liked and most-disliked sportscaster.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, look to last year's excellent HBO documentary, ``Howard
Cosell: Telling It Like It Is,'' for footage of shotgun-toting
yahoos blasting away at a TV set during a game.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Limbaugh's politics could be a problem, but not an
insurmountable one. ABC could forbid him to air his political
views. Or, what the heck, since the booth needs three people, hire
James Carville, too. &QL; 
_ Stuff you probably knew already: ABC finished first among major
networks for the 1999-2000 TV season, which officially ended
Wednesday night. Who wants to guess a million reasons why? A big
hint: One is Regis Philbin. &QL; 
_ Stuff you probably knew already, part two: The National
Organization for Women's recently issued Feminist Primetime Report
came down hardest on Fox's ``Who Wants To Marry a Millionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   To which the only appropriate reaction can be:
</P>
<P>
   Well, duh. &QL;

`SEASON OF THE MILLIONAIRE': GAME SHOW REVIVES NETWORK HOPES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The scene: Last summer, a conference room in a California hotel
full of cynical, punch-drunk TV critics sitting through endless
network presentations of new shows.
</P>
<P>
   ABC trots out a couple of guys to talk about some game show it's
planning to air during the summer, when the TV pickings are slim
and competition non-existent.
</P>
<P>
   Yawn. That's the general reaction. Some stupid quiz show hosted
by that guy whose day job is chatting with Kathie Lee whatshername?
</P>
<P>
   Right. In a month it'll be history.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, of course, ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' made
history, changing not only the course of the television season but
the way TV does business for the near future, if not beyond, for
better, worse and both.
</P>
<P>
   In a curious year for television, Regis Philbin became a
household name, unleashed a ubiquitous-if-idiotic catch phrase upon
the nation (I vote the next guy who says, ``Is that your final
answer?'' gets a punch in the throat) and arguably saved network
television from the advancing clutches of cable.
</P>
<P>
   OK, that last part might be a bit of a stretch, but not much of
one. A year ago, riding high on an increasing viewership,
superlative reviews of ``The Sopranos'' and more choices than any
self-respecting channel surfer could ever hope to indulge in, cable
looked like the wave of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Still is, actually. People like choices - talk to a Home &AMP;
Garden Network fanatic sometime if you don't believe me. and
``Millionaire,'' you've got to believe, can't stay this popular
forever. (``Frasier's'' season finale, for instance, beat it in the
ratings.)
</P>
<P>
   But, largely on the strength of Regis' show, overall the big
networks not only didn't lose any viewers to cable this season,
stemming the tide of a recent trend, they actually picked up ... a
whopping 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it's something.
</P>
<P>
   Not one to look a gift horse in the mouth, ABC - now the most
popular network - will flog its ``Millionaire'' breadwinner four
times a week next fall. So what kind of chance-taking,
rule-breaking programming did other networks use to fight back?
</P>
<P>
   Ahem. More game shows. At least until ``Twenty-One'' and
``Winning Lines'' bit the dust.
</P>
<P>
   Reality TV fared better, sort of. A month after swearing off
garbage, Fox gave us ``Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?'' As
famous-for-15-minutes (and soon to be naked, to boot) Darva Conger
proved, no one. Yet millions wanted to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, look for voyeuristic gems like ``Survivor'' and ``Big
Brother'' on a tube near you soon.
</P>
<P>
   This is not progress.
</P>
<P>
   What creative risks the networks did take backfired. Remember
``Action''?Probably not. How about ``Freaks and Geeks''? (The
beautiful end of the first episode, in which a geeky kid asks a
girl to dance to the Styx song ``Come Sail Away'' because it's slow
- only to listen in helpless horror as it speeds up - was the
single best moment in TV this season. When you don't know whether
to laugh or cry because you want to do both equally badly, it's a
sign of quality.)
</P>
<P>
   Wonderland, anyone?
</P>
<P>
   Didn't think so. Tough sledding for a while there. Every time a
show took a chance, it seemed, viewers rejected it. The problem, it
seemed, wasn't so much the networks as it was us.
</P>
<P>
   Comedies in particular fell upon hard times. Never mind that
``Everybody Loves Raymond'' continued to improve and ``Frasier''
got funny again (if not as funny as it once was); stories of the
death of the sitcom began to surface.
</P>
<P>
   And then, just as comedy fans were searching for a tall building
and a short rope, Fox brought out ``Malcolm in the Middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilarious, smart, snarky - and, oddly enough, something critics
and audiences both loved.
</P>
<P>
   Hold the rope. Things are looking up.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you're a teenager. Sure, ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer''
thrived as the gang started college, and remains one of the
smartest-written shows on TV (``Hush,'' the `silent` episode, was
an instant classic).
</P>
<P>
   But short-shorn ``Felicity,'' which underwent a big ratings
trim, as well, was more representative of the Clearasil set.
Coveting the younger viewers the WB exists to serve, networks piled
on the Beautiful Young People (``Odd Man Out,'' ``Get Real,''
``Wasteland,'' etc.).
</P>
<P>
   And viewers ignored them, opting for more adult fare, such as
``Judging Amy,'' ``Family Law'' and, best of all, ``The West
Wing,'' a show that managed the impossible: It made politics and
politicians likable.
</P>
<P>
   Not as likable as Regis, mind you, but in his million-dollar
television year, who was? &QL;

MARTINEZ OUTDUELS CLEMENS AS RED SOX DOWN YANKEES
</HEADLINE>
  By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Roger Clemens turned, raised his chin and watched
Trot Nixon's long fly ball rise and fall, the ball disappearing
among fans in the right-field stands. For eight innings and two
outs, there had been no runs, and Clemens had been every bit as
good as Boston's Pedro Martinez _ better, perhaps. Clemens struck
out 13, Martinez nine.
</P>
<P>
   But there was that one pitch, that one high fastball that Nixon
slugged, the difference in a memorable duel. The Red Sox won, 2-0,
Sunday night at Yankee Stadium, although Martinez survived a scare
in the bottom of the ninth inning. ``It was a classic,'' said Joe
Torre, the Yankees' manager. ``I hope to hell it puts to rest all
the questions about Roger.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox won two of three games in this series and departed
with a one-game lead in the American League East.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens (4-5) got the first two outs easily in the top of the
ninth, and then Jeff Frye smashed a one-hopper back at Clemens. The
ball bounced off Clemens' glove and toward third, an infield
single. Nixon was next, having struck out in his first two at-bats
and tripled _ the second of Boston's four hits.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens hurled a high fastball and the sound of Nixon hitting
the ball was all anyone needed to hear: a home run.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, stifled all night by Clemens, clapped and
high-fived one another in their dugout, the small noises of Red Sox
fans loud in an otherwise quiet Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But Martinez (8-2) hit Chuck Knoblauch with a fastball leading
off the bottom of the ninth, and Derek Jeter rolled a single to
right. Yankee Stadium was brimming with hope. Then Paul O'Neill
struck out.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams lifted a high fly toward right, the way Nixon
had done. But Nixon, the Boston right fielder, caught the ball just
in front of the wall; Knoblauch tagged up and moved to third. With
Jorge Posada batting, Jeter swiped second, and then Martinez hit
Posada with a breaking ball. Bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Martinez grounded to second, in what seemed an easy play,
but Frye double-clutched, trying to get a grip on the ball, before
finally tossing to first and barely nipping Martinez to end the
incredible duel.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the best pitched games I've seen, by both sides,''
Jeter said.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens lasted only two innings in his playoff duel against
Pedro Martinez last year, surrendering five runs and straining his
lower back before Torre and the pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre
decided it would be better if Clemens came out and did not
exacerbate his injury any further.
</P>
<P>
   Torre and Clemens never discussed that game again, but the
manager knew Clemens was badly disappointed; you could see it in
his eyes, Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by reporters the other day, Clemens quickly severed
conversation about that afternoon. ``I just pitched poorly and
we'll leave it at that,'' Clemens said. ``There's no reason to
rehash that and go back to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens' nature is to look ahead, but several weeks ago he
actually went back in time to make a significant adjustment to his
pitching mechanics, reverting to the delivery he used while with
the Red Sox. Rather than holding his glove and right hand at chest
level at the outset of his motion, Clemens began pumping his hands
over his head. He has felt more comfortable since making that
change, his rhythm better.
</P>
<P>
   There also was a very practical reason for the alteration _
Clemens might have been tipping off his pitches for the hitters.
Holding his hands at his chest, Clemens sometimes raised his glove
a little higher before throwing the forkball; hitters could watch
his glove and make an educated guess about whether he was throwing
a fastball or a forkball. Now his pitches are disguised better; he
has more time to set his grip. Going into Sunday night's game,
Clemens had struck out 29 in his last 292/3 innings and won three
of his last five decisions.
</P>
<P>
   So he took his Red Sox style to the mound against the Red Sox,
and has never had better stuff since he joined the Yankees, his
fastball sailing, his forkball plunging, his slider veering. He
whiffed at least two batters in five of the first seven innings,
finishing some with 95 mph fastballs, while others flailed at his
forkball as it splattered against the dirt. Fifteen months ago
Yankee executives gathered on short notice at a restaurant in
Tampa, Fla., to discuss a trade of Clemens for David Wells and two
others, and when they unanimously agreed, this is what they
envisioned: Clemens dominating.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett rolled a single through the middle with one out
into the second inning. Before Clemens threw a pitch to Mike
Stanley, he attempted three times to pick off Everett _ and got him
on the third. Clemens threw exactly one pitch from the stretch in
the first eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens actually was better than Martinez, who allowed two hits
to Jeter and had prolonged battles with Knoblauch, who hit the ball
hard twice.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees could not score, either, going hitless in four
at-bats with runners in scoring position. In their last 86 at-bats
against Martinez, the Yankees have nine hits and 42 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   The hitters were in trouble, and if they did not fully
comprehend this going into the game, they certainly knew in the
first inning. With the count three balls and two strikes to Nixon,
Clemens whipped a fastball off the outside edge of the strike zone
_ a called third strike, according to the home plate umpire, Ed
Rapuano.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon paused and stared before walking off. The star pitchers
were going to be the stars of this nationally televised game, which
turned into a feast of strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   But in the bottom of the fifth inning, a foul ball slammed into
the right knee of Rapuano, who fell to the ground in agony. He
struggled to finish the inning, then was replaced by Paul Runge. &QL;

SOLDIERS FROM FOUR WARS REFLECT ON EXPERIENCES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOLLY ANDRES, JESSE HIESTAND, JASON KANDEL, ROB MONROE, RICK
ORLOV

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Memories fade. The soldiers who desperately fought
to save a country, and to save their lives, die of old age.
Generations grow up without ever facing the consequences of war.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of reasons why a nation can forget about the
service _ and the sacrifices _ of its soldiers. But not today, not
on Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   Today, our nation remembers the soldiers. We remember the heroic
battles they fought, the ideals they upheld. And we remember the
ultimate sacrifices more than 1 million American soldiers have
made.

   Here are the stories of five veterans who served the country
during World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War and the
Persian Gulf War. These are tales they no doubt will share with
other veterans and their loved ones when they stop to honor
veterans of years past.
</P>
<P>
   Because on Memorial Day, at least, we remember. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHARLES FARINA
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't think about his last combat mission every day, and he
was almost scared to death when he went out on his first combat
mission. But Charles J. Farina would serve the country again if he
was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 78. I'd pick up a rifle again. My wife might kill me
first, but I'd do it again if I was asked to. I've never regretted
the experience,'' said Farina, who was an infantryman in Europe
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Farina was working at an aircraft company in Baltimore when he
was drafted on June 16, 1944. Until then, he had received
deferments because his work was considered vital to national
defense. He doesn't remember his emotions when he received his
draft notice, but he wasn't totally surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was after the Battle of the Bulge. A lot of our men were
killed and deferments were canceled after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had 17 weeks of basic training at Camp Blanding in Florida.
Infantry training. I was 21 at the time. After basic training, I
was shipped over to France,'' said Farina, who now does volunteer
work during the week at the Don Tuttle Senior Center near his home
in Burbank, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wound up in the 84th Infantry Division under Gen. George
Clark. I saw action in Belgium. I was wounded near Liege, Belgium.
I was wounded twice within about 10 to 15 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Farina said his division had cleared out a wooded area before
advancing on the German-occupied city in eastern Belgium, near the
Dutch border.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first wound I received was shrapnel to my right knee.
Really busted it up. Then, on the way down the mountainside, I was
hit again at the back of the neck. Shrapnel went through my
clothing. It was cold at the time, it might have snowed. We were
all wearing two shirts and two jackets. After I was hit the second
time, I woke up in a foxhole. The date was Jan. 4, 1945.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I had been taken to an evacuation hospital, I remember a
doctor telling me that my dog tags saved my life. The shrapnel had
broken the chain. But I was paralyzed from the waist up for roughly
five or six months. I eventually ended up in five different
hospitals in England. All of a sudden, one morning, I woke up and
the paralysis was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The whole experience ``stayed in my mind for a while,'' he said.
``It scared me.''
</P>
<P>
   Farina received the Combat Infantry medal and the Purple Heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was one of the lucky ones; I came home. My friends died,''
said Farina. As he talked, he wondered aloud that he was getting
choked up recalling his experiences ``after all this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking about Memorial Day, Farina said, ``To older people,
especially those who had been in the service, it's a big thing. But
the younger generation don't put much thought in it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MITSU USUI
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1946 and Mitsu Usui, a Japanese-American who served
with the U.S. Army in World II, was on his way home and about to
realize he still had a battle to fight.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old had just been honorably discharged after his
stint as an interpreter in an Army intelligence unit. He hopped on
a Los Angeles bus to head home.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that a woman who saw him snarled, ``Another goddamn
Jap,'' the 84-year-old Usui recalled at the San Fernando Valley
Japanese-American Community Service Center, where the Veterans of
Foreign Wars Post 4140 meets.
</P>
<P>
   Usui had been a young businessman when he and his family were
placed in an internment camp in Colorado in 1942. Anti-Japanese
sentiment was so high that in Los Angeles, Chinese-Americans wore
placards reading ``I'm Chinese'' to avoid being mistaken for
Japanese, he remembers. Usui volunteered for the Army while in the
camp anyway. An all-Japanese unit was forming, and young men like
him wanted to prove their patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the best showcase to show we're American,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Usui served for three years, seeing action in Okinawa just
before the end of the war. He believes Japanese-American soldiers
fought with just as much, if not more, heart than other soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   After Usui heard that woman's slur, the furious driver stopped
the bus. He demanded that she either apologize to Usui or get off.
She got off.
</P>
<P>
   Usui still thinks about confronting her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was interesting that even after the fighting, she sees me
as a Jap,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the woman left, Usui turned around to thank the driver, a
white man. The driver wore a lapel pin. It signified that he, too,
was an Army veteran.
</P>
<P>
   (more)
</P>
<P>
   RICHARD RIORDAN
</P>
<P>
   He was a 22-year-old lieutenant, fresh out of Officer Training
School sent to oversee an artillery battery on the front lines of
Korea, and he went with all the false bravado of the young masking
a streak of insecurity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I became was because of my experience there,'' said
Richard Riordan, who would go on from his one-year tour to Michigan
University law school, where he graduated at the top of his class.
He eventually became a very successful businessman and, in 1993,
was elected mayor of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before that, I was an also-ran. Sort of a medium student. I
learned a lot in Korea. I gained a lot of confidence and found out
I could handle myself pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   Riordan was sent to Korea immediately after the truce was
reached, but he said he and his crews were on a constant state of
readiness and sent up to the lines at a moment's notice to respond
to reports of activity along the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had to be constantly ready,'' Riordan said. ``Even though
there was supposedly a truce, one-third of my classmates from basic
officer training were taken prisoner when the Chinese would break
through the lines.''
</P>
<P>
   During his tour, Riordan said he was involved in a variety of
projects and learned to trust his own abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere I went, afterwards things would run better,''
Riordan said. And he learned the art of negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in charge of a headquarters project, and it was the
best-looking headquarters, even with a movie theater,'' Riordan
said. ``I got that built by getting a case of whiskey to the
engineers.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
RON FREEMYER
</P>
<P>
   Ten weeks of boot camp at Fort Gordon, Ga., and Ron Freemyer was
a bona fide soldier, with an M-16, 500 rounds of ammo and a license
to kill.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he was that, and this too: A frightened, lanky 19-year-old,
who was drafted into the Army and sent to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea what I was doing,'' said the 53-year-old
Glendale, Calif., resident. ``I was told how to shoot and what to
prepare for, but nobody prepared me for the heat of battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Dropped into a war zone by helicopter near Tay Ninh, a small
city about 50 miles northwest of what was then Saigon, Freemyer
shot several enemy soldiers and captured many, only hours after
arriving in Vietnam on a hot July night in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   As the sun set on July 8, streams of enemy soldiers, some
strapped with explosives, began to break through the base camp
perimeter. The place lit up with flares. Screams from men and
bullets erupted. Oil and smoke wafted through the fields.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of American soldiers shot artillery and weapons fire,
and met and pushed the enemy back out of the perimeter during the
seven-hour battle. The enemy eventually disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   As the smoke cleared the next morning, the Americans recorded
three deaths on their side, and more than 400 deaths for the enemy.
The Americans began collecting enemy weapons, maps, intelligence
information and other personal mementos that the soldiers had
carried.
</P>
<P>
   And then, using bulldozers, the Americans dug mass graves for
the fallen enemy soldiers, and dumped them in, while they regrouped
for what was to become one of America's costliest wars. At the end
of it all, 58,000 soldiers died.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember thinking at the time, this is gonna be a tough
year; this is going to be a tough tour of duty,'' Freemyer said.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the first of 25 battles that Freemyer would engage
in with the 25th Infantry Division during his one-year tour. He got
a few scrapes and a Bronze Star.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to survive,'' he said. ``I thought I was in the
depths of hell.''
</P>
<P>
   He survived by learning tricks of the trade from older soldiers,
who suggested simple things, such as staying alert, and keeping
your helmet and gun near you at all times.
</P>
<P>
   These details run through Freemyer's mind like a river, but he
can still see the faces of the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shot more than I can remember,'' he said. ``Every time I see
a book with faces or hear a loud noise, I just think about it. Some
were young. I can see their faces. Some were old. When I was going
through counting bodies, you find intelligence, and see family
pictures. They're just like us; they wanted to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
LOUIS MEDRANO
</P>
<P>
   From his forward observation post on the front lines of the
Persian Gulf War, Marine reservist Louis Medrano called in
artillery fire and told fighter pilots where to drop bombs on the
enemy just across the border.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks in the trenches, the staff sergeant and his Air
Naval Gun Liaison unit charged through the war-ravaged country,
becoming some of the first Marines to enter the liberated Kuwait
City.
</P>
<P>
   For this Los Angeles Police Department motorcycle cop, Memorial
Day is a reminder of those harrowing times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brings back a lot of memories and a few tears sometimes,''
said Medrano, 38. ``I've never been so close to friends in my life.
There were times we were pinned down by artillery, but all six of
us came back alive.''
</P>
<P>
   He earned three medals on that six-month tour of duty, including
the Combat Action ribbon.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, Memorial Day means my country _ esprit de corps _ God,
Corps and country.''

STICK A SKEWER IN THESE BLAZERS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ The trail has turned cold for Portland. You can
put a fork in that road that was going to take the Trail Blazers to
the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen and Co. have lost their way. The Trail Blazers'
collective compass is pointing due south. It's all over but the
backtracking to L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Those crumbs of vulnerability the Los Angeles Lakers had been
scattering behind them as they ventured deeper into the postseason
suddenly dried up, the trail ending abruptly where the third
quarter began Sunday in Game 4 of the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Glen Rice got his game in gear, scoring 12 points in
10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the Lakers' team defense came together like a
concerto and lulled the Trail Blazers into 29.4 percent shooting.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant scored just enough
points between them - an even dozen - to throw the Trail Blazers
off the scent.
</P>
<P>
   That's when O'Neal and Bryant unleashed their supporting cast on
the Trail Blazers and Ron Harper outscored every Portland player
save for Arvydas Sabonis.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the Lakers pulled away on their way to a 103-91 win
that extended their lead in the best-of-seven series to a
commanding 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Trail Blazers have a finer finishing kick than any of
the great runners this region has produced, they're on their last
legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``At death's door'' is how Lakers coach Phil Jackson so glibly
put it, and it's hard to fault him for his flippancy given that he
hasn't seen his team lose three consecutive games all season.
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers knew for sure they were hopelessly off-track
in the fourth quarter when O'Neal, known around the free-throw line
as ``The Big Bricklayer,'' made all six of his foul shots.
</P>
<P>
   As one O'Neal free throw after another found the bottom of the
net, the Trail Blazers' collective mood grew grouchy. They saw the
writing on the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard some of their players saying the S-word and the
D-word,'' said Lakers forward Robert Horry. ``It's amazing how when
Shaq starts hitting his free throws, it can make the other team so
frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   It can also make the Hack-a-Shaq strategy so yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, who had converted 42.9 percent of his free throws in the
first three games of the series, finished 9 for 9 from the line. We
suspect framed copies of the box score will be popping up on eBay
any day and command a pretty penny.
</P>
<P>
   After all, O'Neal not missing a single free throw is rarer than
steak tartar. No wonder after the game he waggishly was asking that
people not call him Shaquille any more but henceforth address him
as ``The Big Maravich.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, the comparison isn't !ital!that!off! outlandish; O'Neal
and Pete Maravich did both attend college at Louisiana State.
</P>
<P>
   The really startling thing about O'Neal's performance was that
except when he was at the free-throw line, you hardly noticed him.
Before he finished with 25 points, he started by missing six of his
first 10 shots.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Lakers' supposed weaknesses is they're only as strong
as O'Neal and Bryant. My oh my, did the Lakers' lesser players ever
shoot holes in that theory.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal and Bryant were a combined 6 for 19 from the field in the
first half and 13 for 32 for the game. Yet the Lakers didn't suffer
much because Harper contributed 18 points and Rice had 21.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' bench, led by Horry and Derek Fisher and Rick Fox,
outscored Portland's rich reserves 19-8. When people said the bench
could sway the series, they certainly weren't blessing the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   When people said after the Lakers' 29-point loss in Game 2 that
the next two games in Portland could be a death march, they
certainly weren't mentally writing the Trail Blazers' epitaphs.
</P>
<P>
   And yet that's where the Trail Blazers stand today; at death's
door. The burial could take place as soon as Tuesday, at Staples
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, watching the Lakers blaze through here this weekend like
Gen. Sherman's army begged the question: What's left to stop them?
</P>
<P>
   If the bench is effective and O'Neal's foul shots are falling
and Rice is rounding into form and O'Neal and Bryant don't mind
being decoys on occasion, what weakness is there left to exploit?
</P>
<P>
   ``This tightens things up now,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, like a noose.

   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of new books:
</P>
<P>
   ``THE SPECIAL PRISONER''
</P>
<P>
   By JIM LEHRER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Random House, $23.95)
</P>
<P>
   There are 13 previous books by Lehrer listed before the title
page of this one, all written while he wasn't busy anchoring ``The
Newshour With Jim Lehrer'' on PBS. We think he should slow down.
There's a hurried feel to this novel, the story of Methodist bishop
John Quincy Watson, who in a crowded airport catches a glimpse of a
man he believes to be the Japanese officer who brutalized him in a
prison camp during World War II. Watson follows ``the Hyena,'' as
prisoners called him, to San Diego, where he corners him in his
hotel and proceeds to have a remarkably civilized talk with him, in
between bouts of tussling that go mysteriously unheard by guests in
surrounding rooms. These chapters, alternated with Watson's
memories of the camp, are tense and suspenseful. Unfortunately,
Lehrer places his real climax in the middle of the book, and
follows it with a section involving a murder trial, lots of moral
pondering and a ludicrous ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE SECRET LIVES OF WORDS'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By PAUL WEST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Harcourt, $24)
</P>
<P>
   New &AMP; Notable falls hard for books like this. Novelist West
(''The Dry Danube,'' ``Life With Swan'') has assembled a list of
words he has kept over the years that are notable for no other
reason than that he was curious about them. They are here
alphabetically, with information on their etymologies and remarks
from the bemused author on their modern usage. The only
disappointment is that our own favorite words (discombobulate,
melancholy, spellbinding) are not here. Among those that are:
dunderhead, bungalow, grievous, italics, sad, blizzard, gremlin,
escape, serendipity and a few obscenities that are treated with the
same affectionate civility as all the rest. West describes his
delightful book as ``a short homage to words, and the devious route
they have taken in coming usefully to us - some 400 in particular,
most of whom I propose to treat as honored guests, invited in (or
out) for a drink, a handshake, and, in some cases, an exchange of
blue movies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``SHAKESPEARE'S LANGUAGE'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By FRANK KERMODE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (FSG, $30)
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Kermode throws out the welcome mat in his preface when
he addresses this book not to scholars but ``to a non-professional
audience with an interest in Shakespeare that has not, I believe,
been well served by modern critics, who on the whole seem to have
little time for his language; they tend to talk past it in
technicalities or down to it in arcanely expressed platitudes.
Every other aspect of Shakespeare is studied almost to death, but
the fact that he was a poet has somehow dropped out of
consideration.'' There you have it: Poetic language is the focus
here, and if you have always wanted to be more interested in
Shakespeare than you are, if you've needed permission to be
discriminating rather than reverential toward his most famous
works, Kermode is here to light your way. His book is literary
criticism, to be sure, and not for the faint of heart. But it is
also unabashedly inviting and invigorating - you will want to
revisit the plays armed with all that you have learned. Enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   RED MAFIYA &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By ROBERT FRIEDMAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Little, Brown, $25.95)
</P>
<P>
   Friedman begins his book by offering his most impressive
credential, the news that Russian mobsters have threatened several
times to kill him, slowly and in as grisly a fashion as possible.
The Russians, it seems, make the Italian Mafia look like pikers. To
the Russians, murder is blood sport - they will shoot you, a cop
told Friedman, ``just to see if the gun works.'' Now that we've
mentioned this, you'll be pleased to know that these people have
global reach, vast financial assets and an ever-growing presence in
the United States. Friedman has written about them for Vanity Fair
and other magazines (hence the death threats) and now offers this
energetic book, in which he tells anecdote after anecdote in his
effort to portray the Russian mob as the most savage and vicious
bunch of thugs ever to reach American shores. He includes photos,
and judging from the look of these guys (they appear both alive and
lying in pools of blood) a Russian version of The Sopranos can't be
far behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE FEAST OF LOVE'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By CHARLES BAXTER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Pantheon, $24)
</P>
<P>
   Its title doesn't begin to describe all of the things this novel
is, or hint at the skill and daring Baxter shows in writing it. He
is, in fact, his own character - the book begins with an insomniac
writer named Charlie taking an after-midnight walk on a summer
night. On a park bench he sees Bradley, his neighbor and fellow
member of ``the insomnia army.'' They talk aimlessly at first,
about Bradley's history in love and marriage, but suddenly Bradley
has an idea: Charlie should talk to real people, listen to the
human beings around him as inspiration for his fiction.
``Everybody's got a story,'' he says, ``and we'll just start
telling you the stories we have.'' So begins a chorus of voices,
all connected somehow to Bradley, and all of them talking about
love, longing and loss. As the best of them, a streetwise girl
named Chloe, says, ``You can't figure out love without figuring out
death, too, but the effort it takes can knock the wind out of
you.'' This funny, wistful novel is a stage for Baxter's
virtuosity, and a reader's feast indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``IN A SUNBURNED COUNTRY'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By BILL BRYSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Broadway, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's a shame that this perfectly charming book about Australia
has to follow A Walk in the Woods, Bryson's hilarious chronicle of
his hike on the Appalachian Trail. That book afforded him a comic
foil in his none-too-refined hiking partner, Katz. Here he has only
himself, and the laughs are not as frequent or as incapacitating.
Still, he seems to feel an obligation to be funny, as in a lengthy
description of himself napping (he is not, he says, ``a discreet
and fetching sleeper''). The book is best when he does not push the
limits of his persona - that of a curious, witty, friendly,
informative and very British (he is American, actually, but lived
in England for years, as is evident in his writing style and his
accent) tourist set loose in one of the most underpublicized
countries in the world. Bryson's travels include Sydney, Canberra,
the forbidding and huge Nullarbor Plain (its name is a corruption
of the Latin for ``no trees'') and the odd and unfathomable
outback. It's not hilarious, but it's a great trip anyway.

   GOLDILOCKS AND THE THREE BEARS: A TALE MODERNE  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By STEVEM GUARNACCIA  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Abrams, $15.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the three bears had lived as Guarnaccia imagines, Goldilocks
would have bolted before she crossed the threshold, driven off by
the embarrassing surfeit of style. These bears have far-flung
tastes. In addition to a Charles Ennie Mackintosh ``Ladderback''
chair (1902), they own a George Nelson ``Asterisk'' clock (1950),
an Alvar Aalto ``Savoy'' vase (1936), an Isamu Noguchi chess table
(1947), an Arne Jacobsen ``Egg'' chair (1957), a Marianne Westman
``Picknick'' casserole (1956), a Charles and Ray Eames ``LCW''
chair (1946) and many other dysfunctional-looking objects. Our
favorite is a blow-up bed, designed by an Italian whose name we do
not know. Goldilocks makes short work of it, and leaves its carcass
for Mama Bear to find. Goldilocks, by the way, looks like a refugee
from ``The Jetsons,'' and Mama Bear's mouth is on the side of her
face, under her right eye. We found that to be disconcerting, but
there's no accounting for taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``HIDE YOUR ASSETS AND DISAPPEAR''
</P>
<P>
   By EDMUND J. PANKAU &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Regan, $14) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If someone had sent us this when it came out in hardcover, we'd
be gone by now. Ah, but we jest - Pankau's book, new in paperback,
is actually quite depressing, because it is based on the premise
that you hate everyone you know including your spouse and children
(how they feel about you is another book, maybe two). First, we
must tell you that he advises leaving the country if you want to
disappear, although he does give guidelines for remaining in the
United States incognito. Second, he likes to say unnerving things
like ``Three can keep a secret if two of them are dead,'' just to
scare you into silence. He suggests that you consider faking your
own death and erasing your tattoos. He also names countries that
make choice settings for a new life, and rates them (Costa Rica is
a winner) on things like weather, legal systems and extradition
policies. Even if you're not a felon, there's a certain
entertainment value to all of this, and you never know when
something will come in handy.

</P>
<P>
   ``THE SPECIAL PRISONER''
</P>
<P>
   By JIM LEHRER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Random House, $23.95)
</P>
<P>
   There are 13 previous books by Lehrer listed before the title
page of this one, all written while he wasn't busy anchoring ``The
Newshour With Jim Lehrer'' on PBS. We think he should slow down.
There's a hurried feel to this novel, the story of Methodist bishop
John Quincy Watson, who in a crowded airport catches a glimpse of a
man he believes to be the Japanese officer who brutalized him in a
prison camp during World War II. Watson follows ``the Hyena,'' as
prisoners called him, to San Diego, where he corners him in his
hotel and proceeds to have a remarkably civilized talk with him, in
between bouts of tussling that go mysteriously unheard by guests in
surrounding rooms. These chapters, alternated with Watson's
memories of the camp, are tense and suspenseful. Unfortunately,
Lehrer places his real climax in the middle of the book, and
follows it with a section involving a murder trial, lots of moral
pondering and a ludicrous ending.

   ``THE SECRET LIVES OF WORDS'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By PAUL WEST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Harcourt, $24)
</P>
<P>
   New &AMP; Notable falls hard for books like this. Novelist West
(''The Dry Danube,'' ``Life With Swan'') has assembled a list of
words he has kept over the years that are notable for no other
reason than that he was curious about them. They are here
alphabetically, with information on their etymologies and remarks
from the bemused author on their modern usage. The only
disappointment is that our own favorite words (discombobulate,
melancholy, spellbinding) are not here. Among those that are:
dunderhead, bungalow, grievous, italics, sad, blizzard, gremlin,
escape, serendipity and a few obscenities that are treated with the
same affectionate civility as all the rest. West describes his
delightful book as ``a short homage to words, and the devious route
they have taken in coming usefully to us - some 400 in particular,
most of whom I propose to treat as honored guests, invited in (or
out) for a drink, a handshake, and, in some cases, an exchange of
blue movies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``SHAKESPEARE'S LANGUAGE'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By FRANK KERMODE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (FSG, $30)
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Kermode throws out the welcome mat in his preface when
he addresses this book not to scholars but ``to a non-professional
audience with an interest in Shakespeare that has not, I believe,
been well served by modern critics, who on the whole seem to have
little time for his language; they tend to talk past it in
technicalities or down to it in arcanely expressed platitudes.
Every other aspect of Shakespeare is studied almost to death, but
the fact that he was a poet has somehow dropped out of
consideration.'' There you have it: Poetic language is the focus
here, and if you have always wanted to be more interested in
Shakespeare than you are, if you've needed permission to be
discriminating rather than reverential toward his most famous
works, Kermode is here to light your way. His book is literary
criticism, to be sure, and not for the faint of heart. But it is
also unabashedly inviting and invigorating - you will want to
revisit the plays armed with all that you have learned. Enjoy.

<P>
   RED MAFIYA &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By ROBERT FRIEDMAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Little, Brown, $25.95)
</P>
<P>
   Friedman begins his book by offering his most impressive
credential, the news that Russian mobsters have threatened several
times to kill him, slowly and in as grisly a fashion as possible.
The Russians, it seems, make the Italian Mafia look like pikers. To
the Russians, murder is blood sport - they will shoot you, a cop
told Friedman, ``just to see if the gun works.'' Now that we've
mentioned this, you'll be pleased to know that these people have
global reach, vast financial assets and an ever-growing presence in
the United States. Friedman has written about them for Vanity Fair
and other magazines (hence the death threats) and now offers this
energetic book, in which he tells anecdote after anecdote in his
effort to portray the Russian mob as the most savage and vicious
bunch of thugs ever to reach American shores. He includes photos,
and judging from the look of these guys (they appear both alive and
lying in pools of blood) a Russian version of The Sopranos can't be
far behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE FEAST OF LOVE'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By CHARLES BAXTER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Pantheon, $24)
</P>
<P>
   Its title doesn't begin to describe all of the things this novel
is, or hint at the skill and daring Baxter shows in writing it. He
is, in fact, his own character - the book begins with an insomniac
writer named Charlie taking an after-midnight walk on a summer
night. On a park bench he sees Bradley, his neighbor and fellow
member of ``the insomnia army.'' They talk aimlessly at first,
about Bradley's history in love and marriage, but suddenly Bradley
has an idea: Charlie should talk to real people, listen to the
human beings around him as inspiration for his fiction.
``Everybody's got a story,'' he says, ``and we'll just start
telling you the stories we have.'' So begins a chorus of voices,
all connected somehow to Bradley, and all of them talking about
love, longing and loss. As the best of them, a streetwise girl
named Chloe, says, ``You can't figure out love without figuring out
death, too, but the effort it takes can knock the wind out of
you.'' This funny, wistful novel is a stage for Baxter's
virtuosity, and a reader's feast indeed.

<P>
   ``IN A SUNBURNED COUNTRY'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By BILL BRYSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Broadway, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's a shame that this perfectly charming book about Australia
has to follow A Walk in the Woods, Bryson's hilarious chronicle of
his hike on the Appalachian Trail. That book afforded him a comic
foil in his none-too-refined hiking partner, Katz. Here he has only
himself, and the laughs are not as frequent or as incapacitating.
Still, he seems to feel an obligation to be funny, as in a lengthy
description of himself napping (he is not, he says, ``a discreet
and fetching sleeper''). The book is best when he does not push the
limits of his persona - that of a curious, witty, friendly,
informative and very British (he is American, actually, but lived
in England for years, as is evident in his writing style and his
accent) tourist set loose in one of the most underpublicized
countries in the world. Bryson's travels include Sydney, Canberra,
the forbidding and huge Nullarbor Plain (its name is a corruption
of the Latin for ``no trees'') and the odd and unfathomable
outback. It's not hilarious, but it's a great trip anyway.

   GOLDILOCKS AND THE THREE BEARS: A TALE MODERNE  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By STEVEM GUARNACCIA  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Abrams, $15.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the three bears had lived as Guarnaccia imagines, Goldilocks
would have bolted before she crossed the threshold, driven off by
the embarrassing surfeit of style. These bears have far-flung
tastes. In addition to a Charles Ennie Mackintosh ``Ladderback''
chair (1902), they own a George Nelson ``Asterisk'' clock (1950),
an Alvar Aalto ``Savoy'' vase (1936), an Isamu Noguchi chess table
(1947), an Arne Jacobsen ``Egg'' chair (1957), a Marianne Westman
``Picknick'' casserole (1956), a Charles and Ray Eames ``LCW''
chair (1946) and many other dysfunctional-looking objects. Our
favorite is a blow-up bed, designed by an Italian whose name we do
not know. Goldilocks makes short work of it, and leaves its carcass
for Mama Bear to find. Goldilocks, by the way, looks like a refugee
from ``The Jetsons,'' and Mama Bear's mouth is on the side of her
face, under her right eye. We found that to be disconcerting, but
there's no accounting for taste.

<P>
   ``HIDE YOUR ASSETS AND DISAPPEAR''
</P>
<P>
   By EDMUND J. PANKAU &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Regan, $14) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If someone had sent us this when it came out in hardcover, we'd
be gone by now. Ah, but we jest - Pankau's book, new in paperback,
is actually quite depressing, because it is based on the premise
that you hate everyone you know including your spouse and children
(how they feel about you is another book, maybe two). First, we
must tell you that he advises leaving the country if you want to
disappear, although he does give guidelines for remaining in the
United States incognito. Second, he likes to say unnerving things
like ``Three can keep a secret if two of them are dead,'' just to
scare you into silence. He suggests that you consider faking your
own death and erasing your tattoos. He also names countries that
make choice settings for a new life, and rates them (Costa Rica is
a winner) on things like weather, legal systems and extradition
policies. Even if you're not a felon, there's a certain
entertainment value to all of this, and you never know when
something will come in handy.

BOURQUE'S CUP STILL HALF-FULL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The ending was like so many others, in fact like all
the others, but this time different.
</P>
<P>
   The last game wasn't right for Ray Bourque. There was no pot of
gold at the end of the rainbow, no epiphany, no inflatable dingy
appearing miraculously at the shore to ferry him from the isle of
the marooned.
</P>
<P>
   But that was OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really had a blast playing with these guys,'' said Bourque,
following Colorado's 3-2 loss to Dallas Saturday night, ending the
Avalanche's season and snuffing out, for now, Bourque's lifelong
dream of winning the Stanley Cup. ``I really needed to play
somewhere else. It was nice to have a change. I needed a change.''
</P>
<P>
   That, above all, was why he left Boston. There was the Cup, of
course, the chance to find out what it would feel like to rhumba
around the ice with that trophy held high, feel the chilled
champagne stream through his hair like carbonated shampoo and light
fire in his aging eyes. For 20-plus years he lived that fantasy in
Boston, and twice, in '88 and '90, came as close as he ever would
with the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   For years, in fact, Bourque has carried around a mental image, a
precise idea of what the photograph of the winning moment would
look like. He would be hugging the Cup, smiling the smile of his
life, and the picture would detail every ounce that had been
extracted from his being.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would know that you'd been in a battle,'' he said. ``My
cheeks would be sunken. I'd have nicks and cuts. You'd know from
the picture that you'd paid a price. That's how I want it to
look.''
</P>
<P>
   To ask out, for a chance to be in that picture, was all about
that _ but not only about that. For Bourque, leaving Boston was
first to find out if his game was still intact, still able, and
truly to test himself under the fire, the challenge of a playoff
race. He got all of that in the bargain.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, he had eased back into that comfortable chair of
resident icon, duly glorified for his past accomplishments, the
winner of five Norris Trophies. But the product surrounding him had
sagged to such a state, and the losing had become so constant and
numbing, that it was almost impossible for him to understand
anymore what his game was, what he meant to the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Had he remained in Boston any longer, he finally was convinced,
then he would retire in April. He was done. He didn't like how he
was playing, how the frustrating losses piled high, how the
footnote to 21 years was beginning to read like an obit rather than
an honor roll. Asking to be dealt wasn't a plea to send him out in
pursuit of a jackpot, but simply an act of self-preservation and a
chance to find out what he could do with what was left of his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for an opportunity,'' Bourque reiterated
following the loss in Game 7 of the Western Conference finals,
leaving him one victory shy of his third trip to the finals. ``I
wanted to be with a team that made the playoffs, and I wanted to
have a good run.''
</P>
<P>
   He ticked off the names of his new teammates. They rolled from
his tongue in tones of respect, honor, admiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patrick Roy. Peter Forsberg. Joe Sakic . . .'' said Bourque.
``You're talking about some talent. All these guys made it fun.''
</P>
<P>
   There were days he could tick off similar names in Boston. Adam
Oates. Cam Neely. John Bucyk. Brad Park. Jean Ratelle. Terry
O'Reilly. He could say his own name in context and feel excited.
Those teams ultimately didn't win the Cup, either, but they had
presence. As the years went by, though, he was the only one left
standing. There was promise in what was around him, but time was
running out, his time.
</P>
<P>
   Plugged into the Avalanche equation, the years peeled back.
Bourque played 30 minutes a night for the Avs, exactly as he had
for the Bruins, but the results were profoundly different. The
product moved ahead, not backward, important when the grains of
sand are sifting through the hourglass.
</P>
<P>
   The Avs were close to missing the playoffs when Bourque arrived
in Colorado, Dave Andreychuk in tow, and they went on to finish the
regular season 12-2-1 after his arrival. They knocked off the
Coyotes and Red Wings with ease in the first two rounds of the
postseason, even with Bourque sidelined for the last two games of
the Wings series with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``The knee's fine,'' Bourque said before Game 7 with the Stars,
dismissing as absurd speculation that he will require offseason
surgery. ``Not a problem at all.''
</P>
<P>
   What was a problem for the Avs, in the end, was the overall
ineffectiveness of their forwards. The likes of Sakic and Forsberg
(``I wasn't good enough'') were rendered useless by the Stars. Even
with the help of Bourque's refined skill of moving the puck out of
their end, the Avs would see rush after rush break down in the
neutral zone or get turned back once cracking the offensive blue
line. It became painful to see Sakic botch a number of prime
scoring chances that did develop.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 7, when the Avs needed their forwards to establish a
presence early, they instead were striking only in their absence.
The Stars pressed the play, rolled up an 18-6 shot lead and scored
twice, both times on the power play. The second period began the
same, and by the time the Avs finally got their game going, the
Stars were in command of a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very surprised,'' said Bourque, searching for reasons
for the poor start. ``When we came out, we were tentative. A game
like that, you should come out stormin'. But we were tentative.''
</P>
<P>
   When Roman Lyashenko scored for the three-goal lead, Dallas was
ahead, 24-10, in shots. Then the Avs decided to play, but far too
late. Over the remainder of the night, they outshot the Stars,
23-5, including a third period that rarely saw the Stars, content
to chip the puck out of their end, work the puck beyond mid-ice.
</P>
<P>
   With 5:25 gone in the third, Forsberg swept in a relay from
Chris Drury. With 11:34 to go, Milan Hejduk (seven shots on the
night) chopped the lead to 3-2, Bourque sending in the shot that
Hejduk deflected.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly it was a footrace, and it didn't end until Bourque's
long-range wrister pinged off Adam Deadmarsh in the slot and then
ponged off the left post, a foot off the ice, with 12 seconds to
go. Season over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bourque is our general on the blue line,'' said Avs coach Bob
Hartley. He said it over and over again as the playoffs progressed.
Like his days in Boston, Bourque had a way of jumping on the ice
each time action would break into pieces and somehow reassemble it
all, instantly fitting together the disjointed pieces of the
puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   Andreychuk was the picture of dejection when it ended. It was
his roughing minor on Darryl Sydor with 16 seconds to go in the
first period that set the stage for Mike Modano's power-play strike
at 19:54. Andreychuk went at Sydor with elbow raised, ill-advised,
too blatant to ignore. The puck soon in the net, TV cameras caught
the stern-faced Hartley staring at Andreychuk as the ex-Bruins
forward slowly skated out of the penalty box amid the Stars'
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel real bad for him,'' said Andreychuk, referring to
Bourque. ``But the good thing is, he's going to play again.
Hopefully, he'll be back here (in the playoffs). We all know he's a
guy who deserves a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   For Andreychuk, 37 in September, the night may have been
farewell to the game. He may find takers in the free agent market,
just as he did last summer, but he didn't leave with much
bargaining leverage.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Reid, another of the ex-Bruins with the Avs, has a deal in
place to return to Denver. He likely won't know for a few weeks if
Bourque will be with him. As a group, the Avs were pulling for
Bourque.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd kind talk about that among ourselves _ how great it would
be for Ray to win it,'' said Reid, who won the Cup last season with
the Stars before becoming a free agent. ``Now, it's just another
part of the disappointment . . . you look at a guy like Ray, and
it's just so disappointing. Unbelievable. We had our chances . . .
we definitely had our chances.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bourque sounded fine with that. In the postgame news
conference, he was subdued but not somber, bowed but not broken. He
has some experience with end-of-season farewells.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was good for me,'' he said, summing up the 11 weeks away
from Boston, away from routine, away from, in a sense, himself.
``The change was good. It did a lot for me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, everything the same, but different.

PHILLIES BEAT DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HEATHER GRIPP  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Randy Wolf and Mike Lieberthal proved a home-town
advantage can exist at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers are the National League's only team with
a winning record that does better on the road than at home. Los
Angeles natives Wolf and Lieberthal continued that trend by leading
the Philadelphia Phillies to a 4-2 victory over the Dodgers on
Sunday in front of 28,603 at Dodger Stadium, dropping L.A. to 10-10
at home this year.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf used the added energy from playing in front of a large
group of supporters - he left 36 tickets for friends and family -
to pitch the first complete game of his career. He held the Dodgers
to six hits and improved to 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   A day after his first home run in nearly three weeks provided
the deciding run Saturday, Lieberthal went 3 for 4, including an
RBI double in the seventh to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun,'' said Wolf, who was coming off the shortest
outing of his career. ``It's pretty special to do it here at Dodger
Stadium. I've got all my friends and family here. It's something
I'll cherish for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time Wolf, 23, pitched at Dodger Stadium was as a
student of El Camino Real High of Woodland Hills when he led the
Conquistadores to City titles in 1993 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He attended more Dodgers games as a child than he can count,
usually dreaming of being a Dodger. Playing professionally at their
field, even if for a different team, ranks among the greatest
thrills of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty high up there,'' Wolf said. ``I've been coming
here since I was 5 years old watching the games. You dream to pitch
here. To win or to do well is even more of a dream.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers scored a run off Wolf early when Shawn Green hit a
two-out double in the first and Gary Sheffield followed with a
single to drive him in. A solo home run by Chad Kreuter made it 2-0
Dodgers in the fourth, but Phillies manager Terry Francona said he
was intent on staying with the left-hander as long as possible to
rest an overworked bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done a good job for us,'' Francona said. ``Today was a
very important day to get deep in the game and once you get deep in
the game, you can talk about winning the game. I understand that
was a lot to ask of him today.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf realized he wasn't fooling the Dodgers with his changeup so
he started relying primarily on his fastball. He did not give up
another hit after Mark Grudzielanek's one-out single in the fifth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   A lack of Dodgers hitting should not be surprising since
Grudzielanek (.368) and Green (.394) are the only Dodgers batting
better than .300 at home. Of the remaining 11 position players on
the active roster, Sheffield was the only one to enter Sunday's
game with an average above .250 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   As the Dodgers bats quieted, the Phillies' became more
productive, leaving Dodgers starter Carlos Perez with a
no-decision.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Osuna (0-1) relieved Perez in the seventh. The first
batter he faced was Lieberthal, a Westlake High graduate.
Lieberthal's double tied the game. He scored two batters later to
give Philadelphia the lead and the Dodgers their second loss in a
row against the NL East's last-place team.

PORTLAND'S TITLE HOPES PISTOL-WHIPPED BY SHAQ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ As with Seattle, this is a town used to
darkness.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Trail Blazers flame out in a place where there is
nothing else, darkness goes pro.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if Blazers fans find themselves this morning in a blacker
shade of grim, imagine the bleakness besetting Paul Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Having lost billions in the stock market lately, the Blazers
owner from Mercer Island can only sit idly as Shaquille O'Neal
tears up his team in the same fashion that the feds are tearing up
his old company.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well. At least he'll have the privilege in Seattle next
month of opening up the world's ugliest building.
</P>
<P>
   Glory is often found in peculiar places.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Allen and the Blazers, there was nothing
peculiar Sunday about the Rose Garden scene. In fact, all it was,
was familiar.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the Blazers were being swept out of the Western
Conference finals by the San Antonio Spurs. Sunday, they were being
swept out of the Western finals again, this time by the Los Angeles
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   True, it's not technically a sweep, since the Blazers have won
once in this best-of-seven series. But after a 103-91 vanquishing
in Game 4, the 3-1 deficit is large enough for its own telephone
prefix.
</P>
<P>
   After losing two straight at home to the Lakers, Portland's
freakish Game 2 blowout in Los Angeles last week is a dot shrinking
in the rear-view mirror.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-point margin doesn't begin to describe how relentlessly
effective the Lakers were, and how disjointed and befuddled was the
team with the NBA's second-best record.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a strong argument could be made that the NBA
championship was decided Sunday. Now that the Blazers are broken
emotionally, and neither New York nor Indiana, the Eastern
Conference finalists, are close to the caliber of the Lakers, this
NBA postseason is ready for a eulogy, some flowers and a parade
down Wilshire Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   The only real hope for the rest of the league is that the Lakers
lose interest, starting Tuesday with Game 5 in L.A. It's possible,
of course, especially in a town that invented the 30-second
attention span. But the way the Lakers have taken control of what
was purported to be a spirited match among equals, chances are less
than remote.
</P>
<P>
   Even Scottie Pippen, the Blazers' leader who knows something
about championships, could not dodge the impression of purple
formidability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we had played well, if it would have helped,''
he said, ``as well as they played.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers looked so good because the Blazers were nothing close
to the two-man show of O'Neal and Kobe Bryant. With 21 points from
Glen Rice and 18 from Ron Harper, as well as the spidery team
defense that throttled the Blazers in the second halves of both
games in Portland, the Lakers displayed the weaponry and
versatility that made them a season-long nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in an afternoon of free-throw perfection from O'Neal _
9-for-9; I swear it's true on a stack of Bibles, as will 20,209
other witnesses, although their swearing is a little different _
and the Lakers were awash in giddiness.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal credited some of his success at the line to a phone
conversation with his 3-year-old daughter, Taahirah.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't know the game, and I said, `Daddy loves you,''' he
said. ``She answered, `Good luck, and bend your knees.'''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody, it seems, is an expert.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, who is developing a knack for reinventing himself faster
than the media can do it for him, harkened back to his Louisiana
State University days for an analogy to describe his suddenly deft
touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel,'' he said, grinning, ``like Pete Maravich.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeesh. A 330-pound Pistol. Who plays defense.
</P>
<P>
   Rasheed Wallace, the lone effective Blazer with 34 points and 13
rebounds, did not take well a question asking for a description of
O'Neal's impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a big cat, man,'' Wallace said. ``That's a pretty stupid
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a 7-foot-2, 350-pound factor, that's how big a factor he
is.''
</P>
<P>
   As you can see, the Blazers have as difficult a time describing
Shaq as containing him.
</P>
<P>
   The task was illustrated late in the third period when O'Neal
was posted up on Brian Grant. O'Neal faked a move into the middle,
spun quickly to the baseline, slipping past the smaller Grant, then
lofted a gentle, one-handed double pump of a leaner that drew a
score and a foul.
</P>
<P>
   That was not the move of a man who weighs 30 pounds more than
the Seahawks' Cortez Kennedy. That was a Maravich move.
</P>
<P>
   And it turned into a Pistol-whipping.
</P>
<P>
   If the guy comes out Tuesday night with a crossover dribble and
a blind pass behind the back, the Blazers would be well-advised to
invite in Indiana or New York for the second half.
</P>
<P>
   For an ugly task, it is always best to get an early start.

MONTOYA DOMINATES HIS FIRST INDIANAPOLIS 500 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HOLLY CAIN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ He came, he raced, he conquered. Then Juan
Montoya smugly gulped milk in Victory Lane at Indianapolis Motor
Speedway Sunday, the first rookie to win the Indy 500 in 34 years.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year old Colombian made it look effortless, leading 167
of the 200 laps and saying later he never truly felt challenged.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, from the time Montoya first turned laps at auto
racing's most historic speedway two months ago, he had insisted the
track held no particular mystique to him and that the Indianapolis
500 was ``just another race.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But this was not just another victory _ not to
Montoya's CART counterparts, who felt vindicated by his flawless
victory over the Indy Racing League competition, or the 400,000
fans in the grandstands who watched one of the most dominant
winning performances in the past three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Montoya, who won the CART championship last year as a rookie,
beat IRL regulars Buddy Lazier, the 1996 Indy winner, and Eliseo
Salazar by a comfortable 7.183 seconds to become the first rookie
winner at Indy since Graham Hill in 1966. The last Indy winner to
so thoroughly cover the 33-car field was Al Unser, who led 190 laps
in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of fun today,'' said Montoya, who claimed $1.23
million of the record $9.4 million purse. ``We wanted to win here
like any other race, only now I'm a little happier than I was an
hour ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Much was made of Montoya and his Ganassi teammate Jimmy Vasser's
Indy entries because they were the first CART regulars to race in
the 500 since 1996, when open-wheel racing split into two rival
organizations. But team owner Chip Ganassi said he has been
welcomed back to the Speedway with open arms this month and has
enjoyed the chance to renew friendships.
</P>
<P>
   Race runner-up Lazier argued the welcome was a little too
friendly and actually blamed his IRL comrades for his difficulty in
mounting a better challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got stuck, I got hammered, I got boxed in and it was IRL
drivers doing it,'' said Lazier, who also finished second at Indy
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating because they could have at least let me go
through traffic like they let Juan. I guess you have to say the IRL
has really good sportsmanship, maybe too good. I was surprised. I
thought the IRL guys would stick together.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the IRL's best hopes for victory didn't last halfway
through the event, which started three hours late because of rain.
</P>
<P>
   Pole-sitter and reigning IRL champion Greg Ray led 26 laps but
hit the second-turn wall hard on lap 66, causing extensive damage
to his Oldsmobile. He returned to the track after repairs to his
car and crashed again in the same location on lap 142, ending his
day and bringing out the fifth of the race's seven yellow flags.
Ray finished the day 33rd.
</P>
<P>
   Al Unser Jr., making his first Indy 500 start since 1995, was
caught up in Ray's initial mishap. Debris from Ray's wreck badly
damaged Unser's car, so the two-time Indy 500 champ decided to call
it quits, finishing in 29th place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The car just wasn't working after that and this isn't NASCAR,
it's 220-mph Indy cars _ I didn't want to be a danger,'' said
Unser, who left CART to compete full-time in the IRL this season.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest and oldest competitors in the field _ 19-year-old
Sarah Fisher and 53-year-old Lyn St. James _ also had a short day.
They collided negotiating traffic on lap 74 and were scored 31st
and 32nd, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Only seven cars finished on the lead lap. Salazar's A.J. Foyt
Racing teammate, Jeff Ward, was fourth, followed by 1998 Indy
winner Eddie Cheever, who recorded Infiniti's best-ever Indy
finish. NASCAR Winston Cup driver Robby Gordon was sixth and Vasser
finished seventh, forced to pit for a splash of fuel with four laps
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   So in the IRL's first true test of ``us vs. them,'' the visitors
won. However, it was slightly easier to digest considering
Ganassi's team has beaten up the CART ranks, too, winning the past
four championships. Montoya won a series-best seven races last year
and either he or Vasser has finished on the podium in 11 of the
past 23 CART events.
</P>
<P>
   The pair even turned double duty this weekend, with finishes of
fourth and seventh, respectively, in the CART race at Nazareth,
Pa., on Saturday before jetting back to Indy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just one (CART driver) beat us today, but he's a super
talent,'' Salazar said.
</P>
<P>
   So good even IRL team owner and four-time Indy 500 winner A.J.
Foyt had to concede, ``That kid's just one hell of a race driver.''

MONTOYA WINS RESPECT WITH VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
 500-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ He was openly criticized for being too brash, too
young, too cheeky to have any regard or sense of history for what
it meant to drive the Indianapolis 500, let alone win the Greatest
Spectacle in Racing.
</P>
<P>
   So, when Juan Montoya arrived at the Brickyard with teammate
Jimmy Vasser and Target/Chip Ganassi Racing from Championship Auto
Racing Teams, the 24-year-old virtuoso, who won last year's CART
title as a rookie, was treated with some disdain.
</P>
<P>
   Former CART driver and two-time Indy 500 winner Al Unser Jr.
didn't believe Montoya showed the Speedway its proper respect. He
felt Montoya didn't hold it in enough awe.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, though, all of Indy seemed to be in awe of Montoya.
</P>
<P>
   There was joy from Montoya's home in Bogota, Colombia, all the
way to CART's headquarters in Troy, Mich., after the reigning CART
FedEx Championship Series champion took on all comers from the Indy
Racing League _ from IRL champion Greg Ray, the pole-sitter who
twice crashed and finished last, to runner-up Buddy Lazier,
third-place finisher Eliseo Salazar, and fourth-place finisher Jeff
Ward _ and dominated the IRL's crown jewel by winning the 84th Indy
500 as a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a CART deal,'' Ward said. ``It's a Montoya deal.''
</P>
<P>
   That much was evident from the rain-delayed start to the
euphoric finish after Montoya, winless in five CART races this
season, became the first rookie since Graham Hill in 1966 to be
received in Victory Lane. While Hill didn't drink the milk, Montoya
had milk and cookies when he snacked on Oreos with Ganassi at the
winner's press conference.
</P>
<P>
   Montoya led 167 laps, including 143 consecutive to set a record
for a rookie driver, and captured a $1,235,690 share of Indy's
record purse of $9,476,505.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will take time to realize what I just won,'' said
Montoya. ``I was happy to cross the finish line. It's so exciting.
I can't believe it. The car was comfortable. Every lap today, I
just had to keep pushing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowing to Indy's hallowed traditions, Montoya rolled his
Target-sponsored G Force-Aurora into Victory Lane and partook in
all its spoils. He had the laurel wreath draped around his
shoulders, took a sloppy swig from an ice cold bottle of milk, and,
as an added bonus, enjoyed an even sloppier kiss from his
girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   And while he admitted ``pushing it hard all day,'' Montoya
seemed to make everything look so facile. He qualified second in
the 33-car grid in a four-lap average of 223.372 miles per hour in
cold conditions that induced eight previous drivers to wave off in
succession. He sliced and diced with Ray, Lazier, et al., got great
fuel mileage from his car, and enjoyed flawless pit stops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The car was perfect,'' Montoya said. ``We didn't have to risk
anything. And it's not only a win for me, or for Chip or for Jimmy,
but for every person on the team. They worked so hard. They wanted
this win so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Montoya had led so many consecutive laps he
thought he was going to lap his own teammate, Vasser, and radioed
Ganassi to have him pull over. Montoya, though, was unaware Vasser
inherited the lead when Montoya pitted for the last time on Lap
175.
</P>
<P>
   ``He calls me and I was like, `Uh, Juan, he's the leader. That's
for position.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Although Vasser wound up relinquishing the lead to Montoya on
Lap 179, Ganassi said Vasser played a critical role in the victory
in helping determine the proper wing adjustments to Montoya's car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the decision was based on what Jimmy did earlier (on a
pit on Lap 159),'' said Ganassi, who explained that Vasser's wing
adjustments made for a loose setup on the car that prompted the
team to stay with a tight setup on Montoya's car. ``We did the
opposite, so Jimmy can take ownership in this win.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could diminish this triumph for Montoya. Not the rainy
weather. Not the three-hour delay. Nor the condescending comments
from Unser, who said of Montoya, ``They carry people out of here on
stretchers, so if you don't respect this place, it will bite you.''
</P>
<P>
   Unser, though, appeared rusty in his first race back at Indy. He
finished a distant 29th when he parked it after 103 laps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to admire Al, because on the ovals he was a great
driver,'' said Montoya. ``I'm surprised that he said that. It's the
second time he does it. I don't know, but I just go out there and
push it. If someone else doesn't what to push it, then it's up to
them. I go out and just try to do my best.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, taking a cheeky parting shot, he added with a laugh, ``It
really (bit) me, so I'm surprised I won.''
</P>
<P>
   If he was, then he was all alone.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE REALITY LIVES UP TO THE HYPE FOR A NIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (REWRITES with result of game) 
By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   NEW YORK _ The celebrated pitching
matchup between Pedro Martinez and Roger Clemens took place at
Yankee Stadium Sunday night. If anyone had any question as to why
it should have been so celebrated, developments emphatically
provided the answer.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Martinez half of the matchup in the Boston Red Sox game with
the New York Yankees had never been in question. If there had been
any doubt, it was about Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they want to acknowledge it or not, the Yankees have
found Clemens to be an enigma in his season and a third with them.
His 14-10 record and 4.60 earned run average were nothing to
celebrate last season, and the 4-4 record and 4.26 ERA he took into
Sunday night's game had not earned any raves.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday night Clemens was every bit as dominating as
Martinez, more so actually for the first eight innings. But in the
ninth, Clemens weakened ever so slightly and it cost him.
</P>
<P>
   With two out, Clemens could not hold Jeff Frye's hard
one-bouncer, and it went for a single. Trot Nixon then drove a 2-1
Clemens fastball into the beerless bleachers in right-center field
for a home run.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez staggered slightly himself in the Yankees' half of the
ninth, allowing the first two batters to reach base. But he
recovered and completed his four-hit shutout and a 2-0 victory, at
the same time lowering his world-leading ERA to 1.05.
</P>
<P>
   Through the first six innings, Clemens faced the minimum number
of batters, 18. The Red Sox managed to get two singles in that
span, but Clemens picked Carl Everett off first base in the second
inning and Jorge Posada threw out John Valentin at second on what
appeared to be a botched hit-and-run in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox threatened to break Clemens' stranglehold on them in
the seventh when Nixon lashed a one-out triple to left-center
field. But Clemens tightened his hold around their throats just a
little more, striking out Brian Daubach and Nomar Garciaparra, the
latter batter for the third time.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens' 13-strikeout performance explained why no one was
jumping to any negative conclusions about the 37-year-old
right-hander.
</P>
<P>
   Asked, for example, before the game if Clemens had lost
something, Mike Stanley, the Red Sox first baseman Sunday night,
said: ``I wouldn't tell him that. Every time somebody tells him he
can't do something, he goes out and proves them wrong. He was no
longer wanted in this organization and went out and won two Cy
Youngs. He almost relishes the fact that people think he can't do
it anymore. I'm going to give him every ounce of respect that I've
ever had for him when he was at the top of his game because he's
still a presence on the mound and still knows how to get people
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley said he had no intention of underestimating Clemens in
this confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You take your `A' game out against Roger,'' he said before
getting no hits in three tries against Clemens. ``You go out
thinking he's going to be the five-time Cy Young award winner that
he is. You have to put just as much concentration and effort into
your at-bats.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentin, the Red Sox third baseman, said he had lost no respect
for the man who was his teammate in Boston for five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, he's getting a little bit older now, but he is still
throwing 95, 96 mph, still throwing hard,'' Valentin said before
getting a single in three at-bats. ``I still think he is Roger
Clemens. He's still one of the best.''
</P>
<P>
   But Valentin offered an insight into why Clemens might not
attain the same results now as he did in his Cy Young years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think more than anything he's having trouble with his
command,'' Valentin said. ``That's the only thing I think is
different. When he throws his off-speed pitches, sometimes he
misses and they're up in the zone and that's when he can get hit.
He falls behind hitters and he walks hitters. He's walking more
hitters these days, I think, than he ever has in his career. I
think that's a very big factor. Why is that happening? I don't have
that answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, who had averaged four walks per nine innings, walked no
one last night.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Red Sox faced Clemens, they beat up on him in
the league championship series last October. They knocked him out
one batter into the third inning. Stanley, with a single, was that
hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to beat him like we did last year in the
playoffs,'' Stanley said, ``is if he's off. If he's on his game,
then you're scratching to get a couple. He obviously wasn't on top
of his game. I'd hate to sit here and think it was all to our
credit, that he was on top of his game and we were better than he
was. That's not the way it works with a quality pitcher like
Roger.''
</P>
<P>
   The point is Clemens was off his game, giving up five early runs
in the park where he had won so many games and before the fans who
had cheered so hard for him for so long.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez also pitched in that celebrated matchup. When he left
the game, after seven innings, he did so on his own terms. He had
allowed the Yankees only two hits and he had struck out 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to give hitters a lot of credit,'' Valentin said.
``Roger's been in the league for a long, long time. When hitters
face you year after year, they get to know you a little better in
how you throw your slider, how you throw your split-finger and so
on. Pitchers have to make adjustments. Give hitters credit. They
make adjustments. He's not going to be as dominant as he was.'' &QL;

TIGER'S DESTINY DELAYED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ohio _ The combination is nearly unbeatable: Tiger Woods
and Jack Nicklaus. We say nearly because, once again, Mother Nature
has proven to be more powerful than anything Woods can unleash off
the tee and more dogged than Nicklaus's legendary determination.
</P>
<P>
   After blessing the Memorial Tournament with three days of
playable weather, the forces of nature took over Sunday, unleashing
sheets of rain and pushing back Woods's victory march until Monday.
It will mark the third Monday finish in 25 years of this
prestigious but weather-plagued event that stands as Nicklaus's
testament to tournament golf.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, thanks to rounds of 71-63-65 at Muirfield Village Golf
Club, is on the threshold of his fourth win of the year and 19th in
his brief but spectacular career. He will tee off at approximately
10:30 a.m. at 17-under par, six shots ahead of playing partner
Steve Lowery, seven in front of Justin Leonard, and eight clear of
Mike Weir. In all, 36 players had not started the final round and
only one pairing _ Corey Pavin (71) and Don Pooley (71) _ finished.
</P>
<P>
   The rain, said Woods, was no big deal. ``It's easy if you
haven't teed off. When you've already played a few holes it's more
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Play was suspended at 11:15 a.m. because of lightning, but Ben
Nelson, tournament director for the PGA Tour, said a second storm
passed through that actually caused the most damage. ``The bunkers
have been washed out, the creeks are over the banks, and the lakes
are over the hazard lines,'' said Nelson, who indicated the course
would be playable Monday. Cutting the event to 54 holes was not
seriously considered, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can play Monday and the forecast is good (it is
reasonable, though not great), we'll play Monday. We intend to play
72 holes every week.''
</P>
<P>
   Twice already this year _ the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am and
the Tournament Players Championship _ the Tour has had to push a
finish back to Monday, and it should come as no surprise the
Memorial will be added to that list. It is, after all, the 16th
time in 25 starts that rain has played a role in this tourney and
for the 10th time in its history, the Memorial's final round was
interrupted by the forces of nature.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Woods appeared unruffled. And for good reason. He
has, after all, built the largest 54-hole lead on Tour this year,
and there is the overwhelming reality that he has gone on to win 15
of the 17 events in which he held a third-round lead. Throw in his
68.13 average in final rounds this year _ best on Tour _ and you
have a sense of how secure the situation seems to be for him.
</P>
<P>
   CBS will have taped coverage from 2-4 p.m.

   NEW YORK _ There is a reason why sweeps at this juncture of the
NBA playoffs are news.
</P>
<P>
   They're not easy to get.
</P>
<P>
   Many a team puts its rival in jeopardy by winning its first two
games of a seven-game series at home. But landing the knockout blow
when the scene shifts to the other guy's gym is quite another
matter. There now have been 126 NBA seven-game series in either a
2-2-1-1-1 or 2-3-2 format in which the team with the home-court
advantage has won Games 1 and 2 in their friendly confines. The W-L
of that team in Game 3? It's 43-83.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened at Madison Square Garden Saturday should not
have surprised anyone. The team that is 0-2 and coming back home
can be counted on to play with uncommon ferocity, and if you've
been paying a little attention you may have noticed that the Knicks
play with more ferocity than most other folks. You can foist all
the Boston hatred you want on them, but never fail to respect the
competitive nature of this particular New York squad.
</P>
<P>
   Playing without Patrick Ewing and getting a negligible
five-minute contribution from Marcus Camby before he was taken to
the hospital for X-rays on his right knee, the Knicks shrugged off
a 21-point first-half bombardment by Indiana's Rik Smits. They
answered with a 30-point third period that led to a 98-95 victory
that was not, as we scribes are wont to say, as close as the final
score indicated.
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, the journalistic fun has begun in the Big Apple.
The Great Debate (Resolved: The Knicks Are Better Off Without
Patrick Ewing) rages anew. For coach Jeff Van Gundy, eternal
guardian of the captain's honor, there is no more aggravating and
painful hoop topic. But there is nothing the brooding mentor can
do. The New York media and the Knicks faithful watch the games, and
they draw conclusions. They saw an energized New York team torment
the slower Pacers with a pivot-less, up-tempo offense that featured
the obvious offensive skills of Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston,
who combined for 60 points in the Game 3 victory. The immediate
thought: Who needs the Big Guy? Is he not a ponderous relic who
cloggeth the lane and sloweth down the offense and just plain
gummeth up the works?
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy would rather coach a full game in his birthday suit
than admit anything of the sort. The team needs Patrick's
rebounding. The team needs Patrick's low-post offense. The team
needs Patrick's (occasional) blocked shots. They need Patrick's
Yoda-like presence. At least, that's the way Van Gundy sees it. He
also points to the record, which does reveal that the team did
better with him last year, both in the regular season and in the
playoffs, than without him.
</P>
<P>
   Both factions are half right. It's all about matchups. What Van
Gundy should be thinking is that not all opponents are created
equal. His aging center has more value in some situations than
others. This is pretty clearly one of the others.
</P>
<P>
   The Knick players believe they can defeat Indiana with or
without Ewing, but it's rather obvious certain players perform more
freely against Indiana without him. The Pacers are a finesse team
with just one even remotely physical player _ Dale Davis. In Smits
they have a 7-foot-4-inch center who is 6-10 on offense and 6-4 on
defense. His value begins and ends with his ability to put the ball
in the basket. The Knicks respect that ability, but worry about his
presence in no other area.
</P>
<P>
   They got by Indiana without Ewing last year. But when they ran
up against San Antonio in the Finals it was an entirely different
matter. The Spurs suited up a pair of 7-footers, David Robinson and
Tim Duncan, who rebound, play defense, intimidate, and score. New
York had zero chance. As is the NBA norm, it's all about matchups.
</P>
<P>
   One major difference between this year and last year concerns
the status of Marcus Camby, who was a Pacer killer a year ago. If
he cannot play, the Knicks eventually will pay the price. They
probably will be too small and too limited in their approach.
</P>
<P>
   None of this mattered Saturday, because that was a classic Game
3 for the team in the 0-2 situation. In no fewer than 41 previous
cases, a team that would eventually lose a seven-game series by a
4-1 margin salvaged some dignity by winning Game 3. Call it the
Cornered Rat Syndrome, if you will, but acknowledge the essential
logic. If a team has any class at all, it will play maniacally in
that situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe our team has exceptional pride,'' said Van Gundy.
``You could have, subconsciously, had a little give-in after
halftime (New York trailed by 1), and I just thought we hung in
there very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Indiana did not hang in there at all, which came as no great
surprise to its mentor. ``I've been living with this for 2 1/2
years,'' said Larry Bird, who, like his predecessor Larry Brown,
cannot comprehend how the Pacers can be so continually fragile from
the eyebrows up. Before the game even started Bird was bemoaning
his team's approach, explaining that he had heard too many guys
talking in terms of ``getting a split'' in New York. Sure enough,
check out the postgame thoughts of Jalen Rose, author of one of the
great Golden Trashcan performances in playoff history, a 22-point
fourth quarter that meant zilch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came in here with the intention of trying to win one,''
Rose said. ``Obviously, we didn't win today, but we still have a
game on Monday . . . We are the team that, if we win on Monday, we
will be 3-1 and going back home, so we have no reason to hang our
heads.''
</P>
<P>
   History still favors the Pacers in a big way. In the previous
125 series in question, the series record of the team going up,
2-0, is 121-4. Losing Game 3 is very often part of the deal. All
the same, there is no doubt which of these two is the spunkier
team. Ever hear of Rasputin? He lives in the spirit of the New York
Knicks.

LAKERS COMING HOME HAPPY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ After eight months of absorbing their coach's
Eastern philosophy, meditation sessions and unique views of the
universe, the whole Zen package came together for the Los Angeles
Lakers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   With tension booming through the Rose Garden, with the Portland
Trail Blazers grasping for their throats, the Lakers were the
portrait of relaxation. It's as if all the chaos they've endured
for years had finally spun to its conclusion, leaving them
remarkably calm as they stood on the precipice of a new stage in
their team evolution.
</P>
<P>
   One more win, and they are Western Conference champions.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers took a giant step toward assuming that mantle Sunday,
methodically putting down the Blazers 103-91 to take a commanding
3-1 lead in the conference finals. The best-of-seven series moves
back to L.A. for Game 5 on Tuesday, and the Lakers appear poised to
finish this off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's huge,'' said Robert Horry, ``because now you need just
one win to take care of business. And we just have to keep going
out and playing extremely hard. The thing about this is, we can't
feel relaxed. We've got to go in like we're down 3-1 and go at them
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The odd part is, they already are as relaxed as can be.
Everything Zen.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Phil Jackson smiled as much as he hollered Sunday.
Shaquille O'Neal calmly sunk all nine free throws, grinning and
wagging his tongue. Kobe Bryant slipped a little, but Glen Rice,
celebrating his 33rd birthday, proved that even astrology was on
the Lakers' side, as he scored a postseason-high 21 points.
</P>
<P>
   All biorhythms, it seemed, were in sync. All the little pieces
fell into place with perfection, as if by design.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal scored 25 points to lead the way. Bryant overcame a slow
start for 18 points. Ron Harper kept slashing to the basket to
pitch in another 18, and reserves Derek Fisher and Robert Horry did
the rest.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the fourth quarter arrived, the Lakers were well in
command, A.C. Green's little stuffed bear was in place on his
shoulder, and Fisher was paying homage to his suspended teammate -
wearing Brian Shaw's No. 20 jersey to midcourt as he waited to
check in.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is for my boy Shaw back at the hotel,'' Harper said.
``We're about to go get him and go home on the flight and enjoy
this one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that we had nothing to lose today,'' O'Neal said. ``So
we just came in kind of loose. I was loose the whole game. I played
a pretty good first quarter, a pretty good first half and I was
loose. I was real loose.''
</P>
<P>
   He can afford to be. O'Neal and Bryant are scoring less, but
have overcome the Blazers' quick double-teams. Scottie Pippen,
playing against Bryant's hyper defense, is no longer hurting them
(he had 11 points Sunday), and even with Rasheed Wallace scoring a
career-playoff-high 34 points, the Lakers seem to have mastered the
Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the worth of owner Paul Allen's team is plummeting
faster than his Microsoft stock. And no amount of his monopoly
money can patch the holes fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers are showing signs of cashing in. The frustration was
evident in Pippen's forced woeful smiles in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough, you know,'' Fisher said. ``Both teams are the best
teams in basketball and it's kind of similar to what happened to us
in Game 2. Once a team builds momentum and takes control, they're
too good to try and fight back in the game. So I think they
recognized that this was our game today and they were just gonna
focus more on Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   That Portland is in this position is due in large part to the
late arrival of Rice. Missing in action for much of the postseason,
Rice provided a 12-point burst in 10 minutes of the third quarter
and turned a five-point halftime deficit into a 76-66 Lakers lead
to enter the fourth quarter. The Blazers never got closer than
eight points after that.
</P>
<P>
   Rice's surge somewhat was by design. With Bryant going 2 for 9
in the first half, Jackson designed a play for Rice to start the
third quarter, and the Lakers kept feeding him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good birthday present,'' Rice said, ``but I hope it
doesn't stop here. They really made a conscious effort to get me
involved today. ... Once I got going, it made it difficult on them,
because they had to put Scottie on me. That created matchup
problems for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Portland's bigger problem is imminent elimination, having lost
both of their home games. But they also have shown they can win at
Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipate they're going to be a very, very difficult team
to put away,'' Jackson said. ``They have confidence on our home
floor. ... We surely don't want to come back up here and face this
arena and this crowd, this team again here in this building Friday.
So we're going to give it the best we have on Tuesday to win this
thing.''

O'NEAL, LAKERS GET LINE ON SERIES VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ Given that little has gone according to Hoyle
so far _ witness Shaquille O'Neal's 9-for-9 shooting at the line
Sunday _ it might be premature or even presumptuous to suggest the
Western Conference final is over.
</P>
<P>
   But it is.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers ensured that Sunday with a second straight gem in the
Rose Garden, taking a 103-91 victory for a 3-1 lead in the
best-of-seven affair. They can close out the moonwalking Trail
Blazers Tuesday night at the Staples Center, virtually a fait
accompli given the way the hosts collapsed in their own building.
LA then will await the winner of the junior varsity scrum between
New York and Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   This one went a lot like Game 3. The Blazers started off strong,
but wilted like the rabbit in a marathon. The Lakers absorbed the
early rush and then put on an offensive clinic in the third quarter
to take control for good. They then cemented things from the line
in the fourth, with O'Neal making all six of his freebies and the
team connecting on 17 of 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called my daughter (before the game) and she's 3 years old.
She doesn't really understand that game,'' O'Neal said, recounting
a pregame chat with Taahirah. ``I said, `Daddy loves you.' She
said, `Good luck and bend your knees.' So this game was for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, O'Neal added, ``I felt like Pete Maravich, that guy from
LSU.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, who also attended LSU, was so hot the Blazers even tried
to ice him by calling a timeout between free throws. It didn't
work. Shaq also had 25 points, 11 rebounds, and 2 blocked shots in
45 minutes, although Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy noted, somewhat
amazingly, that ``those are numbers you can live with.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. The Blazers will never know. They might as well call up
the folks at Pumpkin Ridge for tee times Wednesday. Their 29-point
thrashing in Game 2 now looks like the basketball equivalent of an
internet IPO, almost as if ordered by Jerry Buss to get another
home gate. Portland was completely outplayed in the second half,
the ultra-loose Lakers capitalizing as the Blazers tightened up
like a dry bivalve.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the pressure was on them,'' said Kobe Bryant, who had a
very mortal shooting day (5 for 15) but still ended up with 18
points, 7 assists, and 3 blocks. ``We just wanted to play loose. We
felt if we hung in there, the pressure would get to them.''
</P>
<P>
   And did it? ``I think so, yeah,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   It fell apart for Portland in the third. The Blazers again
controlled the first period, despite missing four layups and a
dunk. They led by 9 after one, lost the lead, then regained it and
led, 47-42, at the half. The Lakers were doing nothing offensively,
shooting 37 percent and managing a scant 14 field goals on six
assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could not have played much worse,'' coach Phil Jackson
said.
</P>
<P>
   The third opened with a 12-point barrage over the first six
minutes from the heretofore forgotten birthday boy (33 years) Glen
Rice, who finished with 21, his highest point total since April 14.
The points came during an 18-7 run in which the Lakers overtook
Portland for good. The Lakers outscored Portland, 34-19, in the
third, shooting 70 percent from the field. They matched their
first-half total in field goals (14), had 10 assists, outrebounded
Portland, 11-5, and held the Blazers to 29-percent shooting (5 for
17.)
</P>
<P>
   That, basically, was the game. Los Angeles took a 76-66 lead
into the fourth and LA knows how to close games, unlike the
first-quarter friendly Blazers. LA had the first two hoops of the
fourth (a Shaq jump hook followed by a pretty Robert Horry reverse
layup) and the Blazers never got closer than 8 the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Portland got a heroic game from a gimpy Rasheed Wallace, who
played the full 48 on a sore left ankle and had 34 points and 13
rebounds, both career playoff highs. But Scottie Pippen's promised
aggression never materialized because of foul trouble and he
managed only 11 points, along with five turnovers. The non-Wallace
Blazers shot a lame 7 for 26 in the second half and no Blazer other
than Wallace managed a basket for the first 10 minutes of the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers talked about having already won once in Los Angeles
and trying to get the series back here for a Game 6 on Friday. But
their words were as hollow as their play. They went down hard in
Game 3 and meekly in Game 4. The epic we all expected has turned
into yet another mismatch, not to mention an impressive show of
strength by the best team in the league.

`FORGOTTEN WAR' REMEMBERED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MESA, Ariz. _ The soldier's mother was at home when the news
came. Rose tore open the envelope, her heart beating fast. The
Western Union telegram began:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Secretary of the Army has asked me to express deep regret
that your son Cpl. Rowley Arden A has been missing in action in
Korea since 1 Dec. 1950.''
</P>
<P>
   Arden. Missing.
</P>
<P>
   Please, God . . .
</P>
<P>
   Early this morning, a group will meet on the front lawn of a
Mesa home, the one with the white picket fence. Arden A. Rowley,
69, will be there. So will his wife and children and most of his 18
grandkids and his three young great-grandsons, along with veterans
and neighbors and church friends.
</P>
<P>
   They will gather at Arden's house, around a 20-foot pole where
an American flag flies almost every day. At the Memorial Day
service, a new flag will be raised, then respectfully lowered to
half-staff.
</P>
<P>
   At the base of the pole, shaded by rosebushes, is a granite
marker. Engraved are the words ``All Gave Some. Some Gave All.''
</P>
<P>
   The small monument honors those who served their country and the
cause of freedom during the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   Bloody, bitterly fought, it is called The Forgotten War. But one
man hasn't forgotten. One man can't forget.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't WANT to forget,'' Rowley said. ``There's not a day
goes by that I don't think about those people and those
circumstances.'' Fellow soldiers. Buddies. Friends he buried. He
still can see their young faces. ``All those men who died.''
</P>
<P>
   Four months after arriving in that faraway land, 20-year-old
Arden Rowley was captured. For 24 nights he and other American
servicemen marched in bitter cold. On Christmas Day they arrived at
their new home, a prisoner of war camp.
</P>
<P>
   His Communist captors did not adhere to the Geneva Convention
guidelines that provided for the protection, health and welfare of
POWs. Prisoners were poorly housed. Underfed. Each day Rowley
received a bowl of cracked corn, or millet _ he called it birdseed.
He lost 60 pounds. Growing weaker each day, he watched their
numbers shrink. One fellow soldier after another died, many from
pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest survived, fortified by thoughts of loved ones and
the caloric feasts of their imaginations. Alone together, the
prisoners took turns describing their favorite meals. Yankee pot
roast. Southern fried chicken. The kid from Mesa High School told
his pals they haven't lived until they taste his Aunt Mavel's
cinnamon rolls, and then Arden launched into a mouth-watering
narrative about the plump raisins and the warm gooey icing, sweet
as a letter from home.
</P>
<P>
   Eyes closed, the bony soldiers could see them, smell them, fresh
from the oven, half a world away.
</P>
<P>
   One day a prison guard gave Rowley a sheet of rice paper and a
pencil. In a letter that arrived five months later, Arden wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dearest Mom and Dad,
</P>
<P>
   I don't know exactly what to say or how to tell you that I am a
prisoner of war. I know you must have worried a lot about me . . .
I want you to know that I pray often for you folks at home and also
for all of us fellows here in the P.W. camp . . . I know that with
God's kind care and protection I will come home to you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Forgotten War? Rowley, who spent 33 months in prison camps,
has that letter. He still can hear the joy in the voice he
recognized when he stepped off the ship in San Francisco. ``There
he is!'' his brother Duane cried.
</P>
<P>
   Rowley spotted his smiling brother, and his mother and
stepfather. Today he can't describe the reunion without the words
lodging in his throat.
</P>
<P>
   The Forgotten War?
</P>
<P>
   Not long before his release, a U.S. officer in the POW camp came
to him one night. Putting a finger to his lips, he motioned for
Arden to follow him. They slinked surreptitiously through the camp
and entered a small kitchen. It was pitch black.
</P>
<P>
   The officer reached up and pulled a string, illuminating a
single light bulb.
</P>
<P>
   Rowley found himself with about a dozen other U.S. servicemen.
On a table was a freshly baked cake. An officer had decorated it
like the American flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``That flag was as real to me as the one out there flying in the
breeze,'' Rowley said, pointing toward the Stars and Stripes
presiding over his front yard.
</P>
<P>
   Until he draws his last breath, the kid who came back home to
Arizona, married and raised a family and taught at Mesa High School
will cherish that remarkable moment in the shared company of those
proud, brave men.
</P>
<P>
   Before devouring the evidence each one placed a hand over his
heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pledge allegiance to the flag . . .'' they began in a single
voice that moved every one of them to tears. &QL;

ALVAREZ A CAPTAIN OF REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Leonel Alvarez' commanding presence on the soccer field
earned him the nickname ``El Baron'' in Colombia. Alvarez often
appears to be performing effortlessly, unhurriedly, his touches
more elegant than exigent.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also an inner intensity about Alvarez that is
manifested in an ultra-dedicated approach to the game. This side of
Alvarez has become apparent recently, as he quickly rehabilitated
from a severely sprained left ankle and has claimed an important
leadership role with the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez was named captain of the team for a 2-1 win over Los
Angeles Wednesday and likely will remain in the role for Sunday's
game against the Colorado Rapids.
</P>
<P>
   At age 34, Alvarez is the Revolution's oldest player, but he
appeared rejuvenated against the Galaxy, defending playmaker
Mauricio Cienfuegos, making continuous sprints up field, and
remonstrating with officials and teammates. The absence of John
Harkes (calf), who was named captain at the start of the season by
coach Fernando Clavijo, has caused Alvarez to become even more
assertive in the midfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he would have difficulty communicating with referees
because of the language but that has not been the case,'' Clavijo
said of his choice of Harkes over Alvarez. ``I don't want to know
what he is saying to them, but whatever it is, it is working.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez' recuperative methods are also functioning well. He was
injured in the second half of a 2-1 win over San Jose May 6. Less
than five days later, Alvarez returned for a full practice session
in an attempt to regain his place in the lineup. But Clavijo urged
caution, and Alvarez remained out until May 17, when the Revolution
lost, 4-3, to Colorado, surrendering three goals after Alvarez
departed in the 71st minute. A week later, though, Alvarez was at
full speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, teams put a young guy on Mauricio Cienfuegos,''
Clavijo said. ``But Leonel was able to keep up with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should be a lesson to everyone. He wants to play and he
never wants to leave the field. He knows that as you get older you
need to do more, not less.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez was not nearly as involved in the opening games of the
season. But as his physical conditioning has improved, so have his
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The secret to Alvarez' recovery was a combination of enterprise
and sacrifice. After the Revolution's morning practices, Alvarez
would meet with Colombian trainer Camilo Fernandez for an extra
training session that would include running with a parachute tied
to his back. The regimen appears to have paid off, and now that
Alvarez is in peak condition, Fernandez will depart to treat
another Colombian, former Revolution midfielder Oscar Pareja, in
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez apparently still has the desire that brought him to
prominence in Colombia and took him to Spain before he joined Major
League Soccer in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team is going well and getting results, and it is
important that we are getting them against very good teams,''
Alvarez said. ``We have to keep working, keep doing good things.

RENOWN FOR BROWN 
</HEADLINE>
 WOMEN'S CREW-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. _ There should be no more doubts. No more
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is the best varsity eight crew in the country.
</P>
<P>
   That became clear Sunday on the Cooper River, where Brown
swamped Washington by open water to defend its NCAA Women's Rowing
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Most observers had expected a stroke-for-stroke war between the
East and West Coast titans, but it never materialized. Virginia and
Michigan came out of the chute fast, but 100 meters into the race
it was Brown in command.
</P>
<P>
   Washington was actually a nonfactor. The Huskies languished in
fourth most of the race and only a great spurt in the final 500
meters caught first Virginia, then California.
</P>
<P>
   Brown answered every challenge thrown its way. California cut
into the lead with a burst at 950 meters, but Brown increased its
stroke to 38 and pulled away. Then Virginia made its move, and
Brown just shrugged that off, too. By 1,000 meters, it was obvious
Brown was supreme and the race was for second.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was clocked in 6 minutes 37.2 seconds and Washington in
6:41.1. Virginia (6:42.79) was third, followed by California
(6:46.5), Michigan (6:49.29), and Princeton (6:50.2).
</P>
<P>
   When it crossed the finish line first, Brown also assured itself
the team championship with 59 points. Washington was runner-up with
55 and Virginia third with 48.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all season long, Brown had been content to sit back and
make its move at 500 meters. Sunday, it did things a little
differently, although not by plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We owed it to ourselves to row nothing less than a perfect
race,'' said Brown stroke Caroline Grogan. ``We put so much into
this season and this was our ultimate goal. But to be leading at
500 meters was something we didn't figure on.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown coach John Murphy, who hedged a bit Saturday when asked
how this crew compared with last year's, was a little more giving
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's still a tough question to answer,'' he said, ``because
they've never raced against each other. But this is as fast a crew
as we've ever had. We've never had one faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that Washington was very fast and we also knew that
there were other crews with potential to win. For the most part, we
just did what we did all year. Certainly being ahead at 500 meters
was a bit different, a pleasant surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington coach Jan Harville was at a loss to explain the
Huskies' poor start.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got lost a bit at the start and then had to stabilize where
we were and try to battle back,'' she said. ``I think we could have
made things a lot closer if we had gotten into the race in the
first 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brown was a great crew today. You have to go out and hit your
rhythm and be aggressive and attack. Sometimes that doesn't all
come together the way you want. Then you have to have a backup plan
to battle back. We did, and that's why I'm satisfied, even if we
didn't have a perfect performance.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boston University won the varsity eight petite final for its
best finish since rowing became an NCAA sport in 1997. The Terriers
coasted home in 6:49.1 _ 2 lengths ahead of Michigan State.
Northeastern was fourth and Radcliffe sixth. ``It was an excellent
way to end the season,'' said BU coach Holly Hatton. ``We raced
better every day we were here.'' In the boat were coxswain Monya
Hudsick, stroke Fiola Foley, bow Hillary Hegener, and Carson
Converse, Lisa Masi, Lisa Waterhouse, Jelena Tomic, Amy Lawless,
and Colleen Madden . . . Radcliffe's varsity four with coxswain
(Cait Koss) won its petite final. Rowers were Tasha Pasternack,
April Larson, Katie Pollock, and Sarah Psutka . . . Brown very well
could be a power in the making. Its second varsity eight won by a
whopping 10 seconds over Washington. The day wasn't a total bust
for Washington. Its varsity four with coxswain beat Brown by four
seconds.

<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ No doubt the men of Championship Auto Racing
Teams will do a little gloating today, and they have Juan Montoya
to thank for it.
</P>
<P>
   The debate on which Indy-car league is better will continue, but
it was clear that Montoya was the best driver Sunday with a
convincing victory in the 84th Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so happy,'' Montoya said. ``All the guys on our team did a
great job. I tried so hard today. This is beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old Colombian became the first rookie winner of the
event since Graham Hill in 1966. But the significance of Montoya's
win goes deeper than a rookie victory.
</P>
<P>
   Montoya, the defending CART FedEx champion, was part of the
first CART team to return to the Brickyard since the split with the
Indy Racing League in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   With backing from Target and Budweiser, Chip Ganassi brought his
CART drivers, Montoya and Jimmy Vasser, back to Indy to set up the
first showdown between the top drivers of the two leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unbelievable,'' said an ecstatic Ganassi, whose team
has won all four CART championships since the split. ``Juan is the
best driver in the world, and this is the biggest moment of my
life. I think this is the happiest I've ever been in my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Buddy Lazier, who won the first Indy 500 after the split in
1996, finished second in the Delta Dallara/Oldsmobile, 7.184
seconds behind Montoya in the Target G-Force/Olds.
</P>
<P>
   Eliseo Salazar and Jeff Ward, two of the three drivers for A.J.
Foyt's team, were strong all day and finished third and fourth,
respectively. Billy Boat, who started 31st in a Foyt backup car,
managed to move up through the field and finish 15th.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you have three cars finish a 500-mile race, you've
done well,'' Foyt said. ``We ran fast, but things didn't fall our
way today. I thought it was a great race, and that kid (Montoya) is
a hell of a race-car driver.''
</P>
<P>
   Vasser also ran well for the Target team and was in the lead
pack all race but had to come in for a splash of fuel with three
laps to go and finished seventh.
</P>
<P>
   A capacity crowd of more than 350,000 watched Montoya lead 167
laps of the 200-lap race on the historic 2.5-mile oval. His team
had flawless pit stops under 10 seconds each time he left the
track. Montoya rarely was challenged, usually leading the
second-place car by more than five seconds on the way to winning
$1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   But Lazier doesn't think it proves the best drivers in CART are
better than the best in the IRL.
</P>
<P>
   ``That team has dominated the other league,'' Lazier said.
``They are a very strong team. You have to be fair in the
assessment of what happened today. I was right on Juan for a while,
but I got boxed in by some IRL drivers. They could have done that
to Juan, but they showed great sportsmanship.''
</P>
<P>
   Montoya started in the middle of the front row, next to
pole-winner and defending IRL champion Greg Ray. But the battle
between league champs ended when Ray crashed on lap 66. Ray hit the
wall in turn 2 when he was running fifth in the Conseco
Dallara/Olds. ``We had an oversteer problem today,'' Ray said. ``On
our second pit stop, we tried to put more downforce in the car. But
it took away from the balance. I got a big gust of wind, and it
sent me sailing.''
</P>
<P>
   The team did repairs to the car, and Ray returned to the track
but crashed again in almost the same spot. The Plano resident
finished last in the 33-car field.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's first accident also caused problems for Al Unser Jr., a
two-time Indy 500 winner who was competing at the speedway for the
first time in six years. Unser's Tickets.Com G-Force/Olds was
damaged when he hit some debris from Ray's car.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hit the radiator, and we lost all the water,'' Unser said.
``We came in and fixed it because we need to keep going and get the
points, but I felt it was real unsafe when we went back out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a danger to the other drivers and a danger to myself. We
didn't have anybody to race, so we decided to park it. This isn't
stock cars. We're going 220 mph, and you can't just make laps.''
</P>
<P>
   At times it appeared Montoya was just making laps in front of
the field. His performance came one day after finishing fourth in
the CART event at Nazareth, Pa. But Ganassi said it wasn't as easy
as it looked.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it was like watching any other race,'' Ganassi said.
``Juan wasn't radioing in saying how easy it was. Lazier was tough,
and both the Foyt drivers were coming hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Montoya will return to defend his title is uncertain,
because he may be heading to Formula One next year. His victory
makes him a hero to all the CART supporters, but he doesn't look at
it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't here waving the CART flag,'' Montoya said. ``We
approached this like we were just another IRL team, and I didn't
put myself above any driver.''

KENSETH WINS COCA-COLA 600 AS A ROOKIE
</HEADLINE>
  By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.C. _ For the longest time Sunday night, it appeared
that Dale Earnhardt Jr. would expand on a distinguished Winston Cup
Series rookie season. Instead a far less heralded rookie, Matt
Kenseth, quietly upstaged him.
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth took the lead on Lap 375 of the 400-lap Coca-Cola 600
and held off Bobby Labonte to win his first Winston Cup Series race
before an estimated 183,000 fans at Lowe's Motor Speedway. He
celebrated by skidding sideways in the infield across the Lowe's
name and then doing a reverse victory lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart started beating pretty hard there near the end,''
Kenseth said. ``I never really thought we had it in the bag until
the final two laps. I started getting a little teary. I kind of had
to keep my head about me and hit my marks and make sure I didn't
mess up any corners.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt Sr. wound up third. Earnhardt Jr., who has a
series-leading two victories this year and led for 175 laps,
finished fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth said he was ``pretty surprised'' by the victory. ``I'm
used to being kind of overshadowed by Dale Jr.,'' he said, noting
that Earnhardt beat him in the Busch Series championship the last
two years and has defeated him frequently this year.
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth proved his versatility Sunday night, dealing with heat
and rain over a five-hour-plus race.
</P>
<P>
   The Coca-Cola 600 is NASCAR's testament to endurance and
versatility. Not only is it the longest race among the 34 contested
this year in the series, but it is also the only one that fully
embraces the challenging variances of day and night racing.
</P>
<P>
   The race began under a brilliant sun at 6:15 p.m. By 7:30,
clouds were forming on the speedway's east side.
</P>
<P>
   The question became whether the leader could reach 200 laps,
enough to make the race official in the event it could not be
restarted. Earnhardt Jr., the leader, completed his 200th lap at
8:17 p.m. Thirty minutes later, the race was halted by rain.
</P>
<P>
   Its resumption came 51 minutes later, and it was a different
world. For one thing, the track temperature, which read 103 degrees
late in the afternoon, was down to 89.4, triggering numerous tire
adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Nadeau clearly had the fastest car for most of the race's
first half, leading 104 of the 200 laps. His only problem: others
had better pit crews. A NASCAR rule stipulates that the order on
the restart following a caution is determined by the fastest pit
stops among those on the lead lap.
</P>
<P>
   Nadeau led by a wide margin when the second caution came out. He
restarted in third place. He easily regained command before the
next caution, but was in the eighth spot when full racing resumed.
</P>
<P>
   Nadeau's pit crew finally did him a small favor on the fourth
caution of the race. He improved from fifth to third _ then quickly
took the lead.
</P>
<P>
   As nightfall came, though, his car was not nearly as effective.
Nadeau lost all chance of winning once he had to pit shortly after
the rain delay ended because of engine trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt Jr. and his father emerged as 1-2. The kid looked for
the longest time as if he would win. But then came the last caution
flag of the evening, 40 laps from the finish. He lost the pit road
battle to Labonte, Kenseth and his father.
</P>
<P>
   The rain delay allowed one driver to achieve a rarity. Robby
Gordon's plan to become just the third driver to compete in the
Indianapolis 500 and Coca-Cola 600 on the same day _ joining John
Andretti and Tony Stewart _ appeared dashed by a rain delay in
Indianapolis. But the rain delay here allowed him to take over the
No. 13 car for the final 140 laps.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gordon was penalized five laps at the restart for working
on his car during the rain delay. His team's offense: putting in a
seat pad tailored for him. He finished 35th.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
PORTLAND, Ore. _ Shaquille O'Neal kept grinning as if he knew
something, some secret that would be revealed to defeat all the
grand efforts with which the Portland Trail Blazers would delude
themselves again.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Cheshire Shaq smiled conspicuously when the Trail Blazers
made another early stand. He almost giggled to himself when he flew
past Brian Grant on a spin move so swift it would defy the laws of
physics. He smirked as they sent him to the free-throw line,
intentionally and in desperation, expecting him to let them back
into the game and the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Neal had begun his Sunday with a laugh, and for all the
Trail Blazers would try to save their season now at the brink, he
never could find reason to worry again.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Jackson might be the Los Angeles Lakers' $6 million
coaching savior. But O'Neal's 3-year-old daughter Taahirah had said
just the right thing, offering just the right touch of coaching
genius to send the Lakers to a 103-91 win and a 3-1 lead in the
Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's 3 years old and really doesn't know the game,'' said
O'Neal, by then beaming. ``I said, `Daddy loves you.' She said,
`Good luck, and bend your knees.'''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his daughter's sage advice, O'Neal still showed the
shooting form of a telephone pole. But if the Trail Blazers' fate
had not been clear already, he sealed it.
</P>
<P>
   Superman juggled Kryptonite. O'Neal made nine of nine free
throws. Portland didn't stand a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the answer right there,'' Portland coach Mike Dunleavy
said in reference to defeating the hack-a-Shaq strategy the Blazers
had employed. ``It's not the league making new rules. It's not
anything else. That's the answer _ you make free throws, and it
makes it tough for the other teams to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal finished with 25 points to lead the Lakers. But holding
him to 25 and Kobe Bryant to 5-of-15 shooting and 18 points could
have been considered a triumph.
</P>
<P>
   In many respects, O'Neal's perfection at the line only summed up
the Lakers' growing invulnerability and the Trail Blazers'
continued ability to find ways to lose at home, where they have
dropped four consecutive Western Conference finals games.
</P>
<P>
   After wasting a 15-2 start Friday, the Trail Blazers led by as
many as 11 on Sunday. The Lakers were shooting horribly _ 14-of-38
(36.8 percent) in the first half. Bryant never would find his
touch.
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers finally had seemed to figure out that the
Lakers had no answer for Rasheed Wallace, who had been making
nearly 60 percent of his shots and would lead both teams with 34
points and 13 rebounds Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers seemed unimpressive and unconcerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We relaxed at halftime,'' Bryant said. ``We talked about what
happened and then came out and executed and put it on them.''
</P>
<P>
   That's all it took. The Lakers got their offense going by
rediscovering Glen Rice. They needed only a quick 9-1 run to take
their first lead. Within a few minutes, the Trail Blazers would
crack.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, averaging 12.9 points per game in the postseason and 9.7
points in the series' first three games, began the second half with
a three-point play. He would make four of six shots for 12 of his
21 points in the third quarter. When he nailed a trey midway
through the period, the Lakers led by six and were pulling away.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put Steve Smith on him, and we thought we could run him
off some picks and give us some different options,'' Jackson said.
``He's suffered a little bit the last few games, not getting enough
shots for a shooter like he is; we knew we had to get him shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glen got us going, and we rode a little bit of a hot hand and
it got everybody going.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers quickly shriveled. While the Lakers made 70
percent of their shots in the third quarter, the Blazers made just
29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   When the Lakers ended the quarter with O'Neal's spin around
Grant and an easy flight down the lane by Derek Fisher, they led
76-66.
</P>
<P>
   But the Blazers still held their hack-a-Shaq trump card, and
with the Lakers still leading by 10 midway through the fourth
quarter, Dunleavy played it.
</P>
<P>
   In 42 minutes, O'Neal had taken only three free throws. But in
the next 101 seconds, he would make six straight. Rice would add
another jumper, and the Lakers would join O'Neal's giddy
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was loose the whole game,'' O'Neal said. ``I played a pretty
good first quarter and a pretty good first half. I was loose. I was
real loose.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first one fell. The second one fell. I just got into a
rhythm. I felt like Pete Maravich.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can develop some consistency, I can become a great player
in this league someday.''
</P>
<P>
   If he and the Lakers do earn the right to claim greatness in the
next few weeks, Sunday's game could prove the most important step,
an occasion they knew could be worth remembering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to take him out (with three minutes left) so he could
keep that stat sheet,'' Jackson said. ``I told him, `Put that one
on the wall, frame that one.' The defensive strategy to foul Shaq
really backfired.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, the Lakers had built a lead as insurmountable as 3-1 in
a series heading back to Los Angeles now seems.
</P>
<P>
   But the win might have been decided even earlier _ at roughly

The Astros turned back the clock to a familiar brand of baseball
during Sunday's 4-3 victory over the Atlanta Braves.
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the retractable roof closed for a second straight day,
Enron Field felt like the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   On the field, it sure looked a lot like Dome Ball.
</P>
<P>
   Starting pitchers Chris Holt and Kevin Millwood kept the score
low and close. Closer Billy Wagner pitched the ninth for the save.
And for one of the few times this season, the Astros staged a
late-inning come-from-behind victory.
</P>
<P>
   Things went so right Sunday, the newest Astro came away with the
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a long time coming,'' manager Larry Dierker said
after the Astros completed a 4-2 homestand. ``A lot of things came
together the last couple of innings.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly in the ninth, when Wagner recorded the final three
outs for his first save since May 4 at Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys were running out and hugging me like it was your first
victory,'' said Wagner, who had blown five consecutive save
opportunities and six of 10 for the season before Sunday. ``They
were happy for me and happy that we won.''
</P>
<P>
   Millwood held the Astros to one run and three hits through seven
innings and 103 pitches before taking himself out of the game
because of fatigue. The Astros rallied for three runs off Braves
reliever Rudy Seanez (2-3) in the eighth inning on home runs by
Lance Berkman and Ken Caminiti.
</P>
<P>
   Berkman hit a solo shot into the Crawford Boxes in left with one
out, and after Jeff Bagwell walked, Caminiti hit his 13th home run
of the season _ a towering two-run shot _ into the right-field
upper deck for a 4-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti was 2-for-4 with three RBIs to raise his batting
average to .325. Berkman had two hits, including a double that
eventually led to the Astros' other run in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Before their eighth-inning rally, the Astros were 0-21 when
trailing after seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves threatened in the top of the ninth when pinch hitter
Rafael Furcal walked to lead off the inning. After Wagner struck
out pinch hitter Trenidad Hubbard, Quilvio Veras flied out to the
right-field warning track. Andruw Jones then hit a grounder to
third base that was bobbled by Caminiti _ it was ruled a hit _
putting two runners on base before Wagner coaxed Chipper Jones into
a popout in foul territory for his fifth save of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just worked out right,'' Caminiti said of the tense ninth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Valdes (1-0), who had arrived in town 18 hours earlier
after being acquired Saturday from Tampa Bay, made his first
major-league appearance since 1998 and pitched a scoreless eighth
for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's immediately part of the family,'' Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   Holt, who had his fourth solid start in a row, allowed a pair of
home runs but was otherwise effective. Veras singled to lead off
the game, and Andruw Jones followed with his 14th home run, a blast
to left field. Javy Lopez added a solo homer off Holt in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Holt allowed three runs and six hits in six innings while tying
a career high with eight strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got some big strikeouts and ground balls to get out of
trouble,'' Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a ton of chances to get a ton of runs and just couldn't
get the big hit,'' said Braves manager Bobby Cox, whose team
stranded nine runners.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood, who was burned for six runs in three innings in his
last start at Milwaukee, was in typical form against the Astros. He
allowed only one hit after the first inning and matched his season
high with seven strikeouts before exiting with a 3-1 lead in the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't dead tired, but I was close,'' said Millwood, who
pitched a one-hitter against the Astros last season in Game 2 of
the National League Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   After winning back-to-back home series for the first time this
season, the Astros don't get long to celebrate. They begin a
three-game road trip at Colorado today against Pedro Astacio, who
beat them with a three-hitter earlier this season at Enron Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't get to lay back and enjoy this one very long,''
Dierker said.

MESA MAKES A MESS OF THINGS IN 14-4 LOSS TO DEVIL RAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ For reliever Jose Mesa, the day before
Memorial Day was anything but memorable.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa's series of May showers continued to rain on the Mariners'
parade when he gave up a leadoff homer to Tampa Bay's Mike DiFelice
in the bottom of the eighth inning Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   DiFelice's first homer of the year snapped a 3-all tie and
started a horrific 11-run Devil Rays rally that allowed the Rays to
win, 14-4, salvaging one game of the three-game series while ending
the Mariners' chances of gaining a split on the six-game road trip.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa was charged with nine of the 11 runs. Things came unraveled
so quickly and so convincingly for Mesa that M's manager Lou
Piniella stuck with him rather than use up an overworked bullpen,
although that decision ultimately was taken out of Piniella's
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa declined to talk about his outing, which, considering his
month, likely was prudent. But pitching coach Bryan Price, who
takes Mesa's slide almost as personally as does the pitcher, said
the problem ``is not Jose Mesa's stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that hitters are seeing too much of the ball,''
Price said, suggesting that Mesa needs to mask his delivery better
and that pitcher and pitching coach would work on that starting
Monday, when the team returns to Seattle to start a nine-game,
10-day homestand.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Jose makes better pitches, then there's no way he's going
to get hit like that,'' Price said. ``I've got to make make sure he
presents the ball better than he has been. He needs some variance
in how he gets the ball to the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Mesa needs something. Price's variance theory might hold some
weight. Maybe just turning the page on the calendar would do it.
Mesa's May has been ignominious, and on the Mariners'
just-completed 2-4 road trip, Mesa twice was the losing pitcher in
the opponents' last at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   A 33-save closer for Seattle in 1999, his 2000 season has seen
him lose his closer's job and put his situation in the bullpen in
peril. His May has been brutal _ 15 earned runs in 111/3 innings, a
1-3 record and an 11.91 ERA. Even without the mish-mash Sunday, May
had been anything but merry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jose's struggles today were obvious,'' Piniella said. ``They
hit him good. Some of the hits were of the seeing-eye variety, but
... ''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella's voice trailed off at that point, the point being
that, starting with DiFelice's homer, many of the hits were
rockets. Certainly that was the case last Tuesday, when Cal Ripken
Jr.'s ninth-inning homer beat Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa didn't come out of the game until he walked DiFelice as the
inning's 10th batter. Ball four was an inside pitch that umpire
Dana DeMuth didn't like and he ejected Mesa. Piniella didn't see
much that he liked, either, but he argued against the ejection
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   It set up backup outfielder/infielder John Mabry to become just
the second position player ever to pitch for the Mariners. Mabry
allowed two runs but got the two outs needed to finish the inning,
the highest-scoring inning in Tampa Bay history.
</P>
<P>
   ``John made a good decision,'' Price said. ``He didn't try to
pitch. He just threw the ball up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Mesa has been pressing so hard that he appears to be doing the
same. But don't look for a change in Mesa's role anytime soon. The
Mariners are racking up big numbers of innings for the bullpen
lately, and closer Kazuhiro Sasaki hasn't been terrific, either.
Mesa remains one of the few members of the staff with experience as
a closer. Piniella and Price can't afford to lose him if he's got
anything resembling his 1999 stuff left.
</P>
<P>
   But the story wasn't all about Mesa. The Mariners only got five
hits, and that's no formula for victory. Mike Cameron homered in
the first and Edgar Martinez homered in the ninth. In between,
Seattle's offense was a wasteland worthy of T.S. Elliott _ just
three singles.
</P>
<P>
   And the fact that Seattle was in a 3-3 tie entering the eighth
inning said more about the weakness of the Tampa Bay defense than
anything else. And, oh yes ... the Mariners showed they can run a
little.
</P>
<P>
   Down 3-1 in the fifth, the Mariners turned their legs loose.
With two outs and no one on, Rickey Henderson hit a grounder deep
in the hole between shortstop and third base. Second-year infielder
Felix Martinez made a terrific sliding stop, then made a powerful
throw without having untangled his legs. But he couldn't get the
flying Henderson, who then stole second and scored when Cameron
rifled a single up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron never stopped running when Gerald Williams tried to get
Henderson at the plate. The throw skipped past the plate, and when
starting pitcher Albie Lopez didn't back up, Cameron raced to
third. Moments later, he tied the score at 3-all on Lopez's wild
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle would not get another hit until Martinez's homer in the
ninth, by which time it would have taken a couple of six-packs of
solo homers to impact the final score.
</P>
<P>
   So now the Mariners come home for Memorial Day. Recreationally,
Memorial Day weekend means racing at the Brickyard, time for the
start of the picnic season and time to get the boat ready for the
water.
</P>
<P>
   It's also time to get serious about baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, Memorial Day signals the start of summer baseball,''
Piniella said. ``The weather starts to heat up in earnest. In a lot
of ways, this is the real start to the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The long days of summer are directly ahead of you. You've got
two months of baseball behind you. Now the play intensifies.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners are clinging to the lead in the West. That should
provide an extra speck of intensity in Seattle, which was in third
place at this time a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   First place, at least, is memorable.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
NEW YORK _ For the New York Knicks, Sunday was a bad-news,
good-news day.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bad news was that Latrell Sprewell arrived at Sunday's
practice with a broken bone in his left foot, causing Knicks coach
Jeff Van Gundy to wonder whether his star guard would be able to
play today against the Indiana Pacers in Game 4 of the Eastern
Conference finals at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The good news was that center Patrick Ewing, who missed
Saturday's Game 3 win over the Pacers with acute tendinitis in his
right foot, and forward Marcus Camby, who played just five minutes
Saturday before spraining his right knee, might be ready to play
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Or is getting Ewing back bad news?
</P>
<P>
   Hard to figure.
</P>
<P>
   The question is legitimate, especially considering the way the
Knicks handled the Pacers on Saturday, taking a 98-95 win to pull
to within 2-1 in the best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because Saturday's victory came in their first game without
Ewing, but it was the Knicks' highest-scoring playoff game of the
season and also their best-shooting game (39-of-74, 52.7 percent).
And over the last two seasons, the Knicks are 1-3 with Ewing vs.
the Pacers in the conference finals, but 4-1 without him.
</P>
<P>
   So, are they better without Ewing?
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Famer Bill Walton, now an analyst for NBC Sports, thinks
Ewing's absence creates more space for guys such as Sprewell (32
points in Game 3) and Allan Houston (28 points) to create shots for
themselves and their teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a perfectly put-together team, because you have
explosive guys in Sprewell and Houston who are so mobile and so
fresh with their games, but then you have the older guys like Ewing
and Larry Johnson, who are more methodical, so it's not a perfect
team by any stretch of the imagination,'' Walton said. ``What
happens when Ewing goes out is that Sprewell and Houston are
allowed to play their game.
</P>
<P>
   ``My favorite player as a kid was Bill Russell, and he's still
my favorite player of all time. What I loved about Russell is that
he did what the other guys couldn't do, and he played his game to
make the other players better. That should be Patrick's role.
What's to keep Patrick Ewing from being a defensive force, a
shot-blocker, a screener, a guy who helps set other guys up and who
allows the guys who can score to score?''
</P>
<P>
   Good question.
</P>
<P>
   The New York players and Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy are
understandably hesitant to admit as much, but without Ewing
clogging the middle, demanding the ball on almost every possession,
the offense runs much smoother.
</P>
<P>
   And with that wide-open lane, penetrators such as Sprewell and
Charlie Ward, as well as a post-up type like Johnson, are suddenly
free to do their thing. And Houston is allowed to do more than
simply spot up and launch outside jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   That much was evident Saturday, when Sprewell's 32 points
equaled his output in the first two games combined, and Houston's
28 was not too far removed from his two-game total (33 points).
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing with Patrick out, Allan and myself and L.J. are
going to get more touches,'' Sprewell said. ``That's the bottom
line. When Patrick's in, he has to make sure he gets his touches.
But with him out, Jeff's going to put the ball in our hands a
little more. We have more opportunities to do things.''
</P>
<P>
   And they might have those same opportunities today.
</P>
<P>
   If Sprewell can play, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell said he injured his foot while chasing down a loose
ball in the closing seconds Saturday, but he expects to go even
though a post-practice MRI revealed what is being called an
incomplete fracture of the fifth metatarsal (the bone behind the
little toe) in his left foot.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell, who injured the foot diving for a loose ball with 30
seconds left, was held out of practice Sunday along with Ewing,
Camby and Johnson (sore back).
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I'm going to play, no matter what,'' Sprewell said. ``I
don't feel like I'm in that (injury) equation. My mind says that
I'm fine and I'm going to be there. Patrick, we just don't know
about. Marcus, at this point I'm not sure if he can go. But I'll be
there. I'm going to play, regardless of what the MRI says.''
</P>
<P>
   Camby, who missed 17 games during the regular season with a
microscopic tear of his right anterior cruciate ligament, is taking
a cautious approach after injuring his knee with 8:49 to play in
the first half Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, it's really up in the air right now,'' Camby
said of his availability for today's game. ``But we're going to
keep treating it all day and see how it is (today) before the game.
It'll be a game-time decision.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be the same for Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   But is that what's best for the Knicks?

 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING _ Early in the cycling segment of the U.S. men's Olympic
triathlon trials, Ryan Bolton started to wonder about his chances
of making the Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   He had started the race with a poor swim, finishing 18th among
the 21 competitors, and had wound up in the third group of
cyclists. While he knew he was among the best runners in the field
and could make up ground in the last element of the race, the
10-kilometer run, he wondered if he had dug himself in too deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not nervous, but a little distressed,'' is how he described
his thinking at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Bolton found out what he was made of Sunday, picking his way
into the second group of cyclists and ultimately passing Doug
Friman on the third and final lap of the run to secure the final
spot on the three-man team that will represent the United States at
the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I'd have to work,'' said Bolton, a former track and
cross country athlete at the University of Wyoming. ``I knew I'd
have to put together something special. But I ran smart, stayed
within myself, and it worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's winner was Hunter Kemper, who had already secured an
Olympic berth. He finished 20 seconds ahead of Australian Chris
Hill, one of eight foreign competitors in the field. Gilberto
Gonzalez of Venezuela was third.
</P>
<P>
   Americans Nick Radkewich and Bolton finished fourth and fifth,
respectively, to earn the two available spots on the U.S. Olympic
team.
</P>
<P>
   Sending the trio of Kemper, Radkewich and Bolton to the Olympics
means the United States will have its top three among the multitude
diving into Sydney Harbor when the men's triathlon goes off on the
second day of the Games. Kemper is ranked 33rd in the world;
Radkewich is 55th and Bolton 63rd.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the best team you could have picked,'' said
Radkewich, a product of the ``IronKids'' triathlon series who
competed in track and cross country at Notre Dame. ``No matter how
things go in Sydney, I think we'll have somebody in contention.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Australians will be favored to win the first
triathlon medals awarded in Olympic competition, it is Bolton's
view that at least some of the focus in Sydney will be on how the
Americans perform in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``People see Americans as tough, as being Olympic performers,''
he said. ``So we do shoulder a bit of responsibility. People will
be looking at us more than some of the athletes from other
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, Sunday's competition proved that Kemper and
crew can handle the killer fatigue that comes with swimming 1.5
kilometers, cycling 40 kilometers and running 10 kilometers on a
hot, muggy North Texas morning in late spring. Unlike their female
counterparts, the men never had the benefit of cloud cover as they
competed on the course put together in the Las Colinas business and
residential development.
</P>
<P>
   As the race unfolded, it appeared to be yielding an amazing
story in the effort of Friman.
</P>
<P>
   Ranked 124th in the world, he had barely made the field, which
was limited to those rated 125th or better. But he was the leader
after the swim and gained a spot in a group of five cyclists that
took the lead in that portion of the race. In addition to Friman,
the group included Kemper, Radkewich and two Australians, Hill and
Levi Maxwell _ meaning Friman and Radkewich would get spots on the
U.S. team if they hung in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pretty much had the team made up right there,'' Kemper
said.
</P>
<P>
   The lead pack entered the transition to the 10K run with a gap
of 2 minutes, 15 seconds between it and a second group that
included Bolton and a dozen others. The run quickly shook things
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``You set out on the run,'' Kemper said, ``and it's every man
for himself _ those hills and that heat.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolton was only a minute behind Friman after the first of the
three laps in the 10K and went by him at the start of lap No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Friman wound up finishing eighth and collapsed into the arms of
two race officials as he crossed the finish line.

   &UR; c. 2000, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
AT the moment of their birth four springs ago, the Comets had no
special cachet, no rep to live up to. Their marquee player, the
only one who possessed any kind of name recognition in Houston,
Sheryl Swoopes, wasn't even on the floor because she was pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Cooper? You had to be a seriously hard-core women's
hoops geek to have the slightest memory of her exploits at USC more
than a decade earlier. Van Chancellor? Same story. He might have
been an institution at Ole Miss, where he spent 19 seasons, but he
had landed the Comets head coach's job only because others had
turned it down.
</P>
<P>
   Van's world had been the distaff SEC. The same as the rest of
us, Chancellor had no idea what to expect from his team or the
league. When the Comets made their debut in Cleveland before a
large and loud crowd, his jaw dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you as amazed as I am that we're drawing 12,000 here
tonight?'' he asked a reporter. ``And that we're expecting 12,000
back in Houston on Tuesday? Never in my wildest dreams did I see
this happening.''
</P>
<P>
   His amazement, of course, has only grown, what with the Comets
embarking on their fourth season today gunning for a fourth WNBA
title. Forget the '90s Chicago Bulls. The long-reigning champions _
and Chancellors _ of U.S. women's basketball are trying to venture
into th rarefied air the '60s Boston Celtics breathed.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls won six NBA titles in eight seasons but failed to
string four of them together because of Michael Jordan's baseball
sabbatical. The Comets are well-positioned to go 4-for-4, though,
because their three-pronged nucleus of stars is intact and the
supporting cast might be deeper than ever.
</P>
<P>
   They rolled, and I do mean rolled, through the preseason despite
missing the services of Janeth Arcain, incumbent center Polina
Tzekova and top draft choice Elena Chakirova. With Arcain having
returned from Brazil, where she's a crucial cog for the national
team, and the talented Russian Chakirova also in camp as of
Saturday, many are conceding another title to the Comets, Polina or
no Polina.
</P>
<P>
   Definitely good for us, possibly bad for the WNBA. But,
honestly, probably not. We Houstonians need the Comets to keep this
dynasty thing going. Their parent company, the Rockets, missed the
playoffs for the first time in eight seasons, the Astros appear
headed for a free-fall return to the also-ran realm, and our
re-entry into the NFL is two seasons away. The Comets are no longer
mere time-killers and space-fillers. Why, they practically hold our
civic self-worth in their hands.
</P>
<P>
   They are a significant piece of the new downtown arena equation
as well. If the Rockets leave, remember, they go, too. And their
many rabid fans, exceedingly pleased with the cost of their tickets
relative to their team's winning percentage, wouldn't be pleased.
Community support for the Comets is broad-based enough to have a
modicum of influence on the negotiations between the Rockets and
the Harris County-Houston Sports Authority.
</P>
<P>
   But league-wide, a groundswell of anti-Comets sentiment
increases with each Houston title. The attitude seems to be:
``Enough is enough. Let's spread the wealth around.'' Of course,
were the New York Liberty or the Los Angeles Sparks thrice charmed
instead, everybody in the NBA's marketing department _ and that's
all the WNBA was intended to be, a tactical marketing arm of the
NBA _ would be delighted.
</P>
<P>
   But as you can imagine, a surfeit of happiness in Houston makes
the suits in Manhattan nervous. Never mind how the Comets'
credibility as a bona fide superpower enhances the WNBA's
legitimacy, exactly as the Celtics, the Lakers and the Bulls did
for the NBA's.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets have established a standard of achievement where none
existed. That's their ongoing legacy.
</P>
<P>
   This is a crucial season for the WNBA because of its far broader
geographical reach _ from Seattle to Miami _ and because of the
NBA's current struggles with its image and appeal. The women's
league was born simultaneously with the men's game reaching a
pinnacle of popularity and prosperity, when Jordan's Bulls were in
championship form. Now, those giddy days are over, dragged down by
sluggish, thuggish behavior in tandem with high prices.
</P>
<P>
   Should the ladies manage to remain ascendant, and the WNBA has
considerable room for growing its fan base while polishing the
quality of the basketball, the WNBA will have weaned itself from
the NBA. No longer will the men be expected to nurse the women.
</P>
<P>
   It has happened in Houston, where the Comets are what the
Rockets aspire to be.

WE finally saw the blueprint to Astros success Sunday afternoon,
and it had nothing to do with a short porch in left, a flagpole in
play, a train steaming overhead, nooks and crannies all along the
outfield wall, or a retractable roof.
</P>
<P>
   Build it, and sure, they will come. They'll even pay $5.25 for a
beer.
</P>
<P>
   But follow the same old blueprint that has won three division
championships, and they go home happy.
</P>
<P>
   For a team that has looked to find its way since opening day, it
was a priceless day.
</P>
<P>
   There was strong starting pitching going deep into the game.
There were the Astros finding a way to stay close. There were
anonymous relievers doing their jobs _ a perfect inning from Joe
Slusarski in the seventh, another scoreless frame from Marc Valdes
in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   There were the Astros finding a way to scratch out a chance in
their last at-bat _ a Lance Berkman homer in the bottom of the
eighth, a Jeff Bagwell walk, a two-run shot from Ken Caminiti.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the stopper, Billy Wagner, stopping the best
team in the league.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't brain surgery Sunday afternoon at Enron Field. It was
the Astros playing the kind of ball that carried them to so many
similar wins over the past three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   It was just baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Astro baseball,'' as Wagner called it. ``Just play.''
</P>
<P>
   And as much as this entire successful homestand could be circled
as pivotal in the Astros' hopes for a turnaround, this one game
should be underlined, highlighted and printed in boldface.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attitude around here has been, `Oh, what's going to happen
to us today?''' Caminiti said. ``You could just feel it in the
clubhouse. But lately, we've been thinking, `What are we going to
do today to win?' It's been awhile. We had been doing a lot of
little things to lose. Today, we did the little things to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering the opponent, no game might mean more than this one
if indeed a turnaround comes. And no player might have gotten more
out of Sunday's classic Astros effort than Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday night's opener against the Braves, Wagner's fastball
was clocked at 95-96 mph. On Sunday against the last two batters he
faced, it was clocked at 98-99 mph.
</P>
<P>
   But if you think a mere 2 miles per hour on the gun was the
difference, you're wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``That gun doesn't mean anything,'' Wagner said. ``It's the
hitters that always let you know when you've got it.''
</P>
<P>
   The befuddled Braves batters clearly let the sellout crowd, the
Astros and most significantly Wagner know that on this day he was
at his best.
</P>
<P>
   After walking the first batter he faced, Wagner struck out pinch
hitter Trenidad Hubbard for the first out in the ninth, getting
Hubbard to swing wildly at a 98-mph fastball out of the strike
zone. Quilvio Veras then swung at a 99-mph fastball and flied out
to Berkman in right field. And after Andrew Jones dribbled an
infield hit to third, Chipper Jones popped out on a 3-0 fastball
that also was out of the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what Billy can do,'' Bagwell said. ``He can make you
guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike recent outings when he blew five save opportunities, on
Sunday Wagner's fastball wasn't coming in at 97 and going out at,
what, 120? Instead of trying every mechanical trick in the book to
no avail, this time he simply threw the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to break his slump, Wagner had watched videotape, fiddled
with his release point, tried a two-seam fastball instead of his
usual four-seamer, and adjusted the landing point of his lead foot.
He spent hours dissecting mechanics with manager Larry Dierker and
pitching coach Vern Ruhle.
</P>
<P>
   But this time he got back to baseball. Just baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dierk told me, `See if you can throw your arm out of place,'''
Wagner said. ``He told me, `This team needs you. Just go up there
and throw it,' so I did that no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Wagner's first save since May 4 and possibly his best
effort of the year. It looked like the same old Wagner, and _ shock
of shocks _ it looked like the same old Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things came together,'' Dierker said. ``It was more
typical of the kind of game we'd play with the Braves when we were
in good form.''
</P>
<P>
   After Wagner clinched the save on the easy Jones pop-up, he
showed the kind of emotion rarely let out from this cool closer. He
shook his fist in the air, pointed at the boisterous crowd, gave
catcher Mitch Meluskey a hug, bumped chests with Caminiti and
darted into the clubhouse for more congratulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting it done today it almost feels like your first win,''
Wagner said.
</P>
<P>
   For a team that has searched futilely for two months for this
kind of classic Astros effort, in many ways it was just that.

PORTLAND, Ore. _ He has that collection of gaudy championship rings
from his time with the Chicago Bulls. Less flashy but even more
valuable is all of the experience it took to earn them.
</P>
<P>
   He knows how to fight the battles, survive the skirmishes and
win the long wars. He understands it is as much about wits and
guile as ego and talent, which is what makes him such a precious
commodity at this late time of the season.
</P>
<P>
   This is why they so desperately wanted him to be a part of their
team, for games like this, for situations like this. To help them,
to guide them, to lift them, to lead them.
</P>
<P>
   While the Trail Blazers spent the weekend again looking like
fragile hothouse flowers in the Rose Garden and Scottie Pippen was
resuming his role as a shrinking violet, it was another former
member of Michael Jordan's supporting cast who was inching closer
to one more NBA title.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Harper stabbed the game-winning jumper in Game 3 on Friday
night and then came back Sunday to twist the knife in the Lakers'
103-91 victory.
</P>
<P>
   On the scale of improbable occurrences in the Western Conference
finals, you likely would say Shaquille O'Neal going a perfect
9-for-9 on free throws would be the equivalent of seeing pigs fly.
</P>
<P>
   But in a period of less than 48 hours when the Lakers
rediscovered their confidence and strut, the odds that it would not
be Shaq or the young phenom Kobe Bryant who saved their bacon was
off the charts.
</P>
<P>
   So Harper follows his late-game heroics with a season-high 18
points to go with seven rebounds and two assists, and now the
Blazers are teetering on a 3-1 brink in the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still feel good about the fact that we have to live with Ron
Harper beating us with his shots,'' Pippen said.
</P>
<P>
   Or die with him.
</P>
<P>
   That's the difference between the pair of former Bulls. Pippen
makes pronouncements, and Harper makes a difference.
</P>
<P>
   For all of the phony-baloney hype that surrounds LA coach Phil
Jackson and his image as the resident mystic of the NBA, there is
no doubt he knows what makes his former Chicago players tick.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Jackson said before the series that it was going to
be up to Pippen to carry the Blazers forward, to lead them in the
series. Jackson has been there before to see what shouldering the
lion's share of the burden has done to Pippen. He was there for the
migraine in Game 7 of the playoffs against Detroit. He was there
for the final 1.8 seconds against the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   When the situation heats up, Pippen melts like butter in a
microwave, which was the burnt smell that filled the arena Sunday
after Scottie scored just two points in the third quarter and none
in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scottie is a good friend of mine, and he tries real hard,''
Harper said. ``So I'm not going to try to get inside his head, just
play my own game.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is a kind of defensive chess match, watching, studying and
waiting for his opponent to move and then taking advantage of the
opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really any kind of big secret,'' Harper said. ``You
go where there's nobody around.''
</P>
<P>
   When defenders are concentrating on big weapons such as Shaq and
Kobe, that's plenty of places, which leaves a lot of open shots.
</P>
<P>
   But Harper is about more than shots. He's about sliding inside
for big rebounds. He's about making the smart pass, finding the
right lane to step in and make a critical steal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just one smart basketball player,'' said Lakers assistant
coach Frank Hamblen.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why one of Jackson's first moves after signing on as
the Lakers' $6 million savior was to pick up the phone and call the
36-year-old Harper, who had been thinking about calling it a
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``P.J. said, `Get yourself off the couch, and start getting into
basketball shape,''' Harper said. ``I told him I wasn't really sure
that I wanted to play anymore. I wasn't sure that I was done, but I
really needed the right situation. All P.J. said then was, `Harp, I
need you.' And yeah, this is the right situation.''
</P>
<P>
   He gets to play about 25 minutes a game and make the big baskets
when they come his direction. But he also gets to nurture and teach
Shaq and Kobe and all the rest of the Lakers who have the potential
to go so far but need a road map at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them when to pick their heads up, if they're down,''
Harper said. ``I tell them not to get too carried away when it's
going good. I'm like Phil out on the floor, and, hey, they
listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Because they see. Where he's been. What he can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have faith in me,'' Ron Harper said.
</P>
<P>
   Which is what being a leader is all about.

   EXPO-2000 (Hanover, Germany) _ Something is afoot in Hanover.
This country has built itself a 400-foot-long glass structure,
called it ``Germany: Workshop of Ideas,'' and adorned it with 47
giant busts of great Germans that include one Jurgen Sparwasser, a
soccer player, but not Goethe. The structure in question is
Germany's pavillion at Expo 2000, the World's Fair that opens on

king in Texas, and the state is grappling with a less glamorous

Especially breathtaking are the thick, deep green lawns that cost

Aubaussan carpets. No wonder the number of visitors is up to 20
million this year. No wonder many of them want to treat it like a
vastly superior extension of a backyard. In other words, littering,
making noise and trampling the exquisite grass. Before, when
Central Park was considered dangerous and rundown, it was not such
a big deal that soccer players tore up the grass with their cleats
or dog owners did not always clean up. But now, the city is getting
fussy about the park. By Barbara Stewart.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ About this time last year, Julianne McNamara
noticed her 1-year-old daughter Hannah drinking cup after cup of
water as she scooted through the house. But never did it seem to
quench her excessive thirst.
</P>
<P>
   It's just because she runs around a lot and it's just another
hot summer in the Valley, friends tried to tell Julianne. But she
wasn't convinced.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, when her husband Todd Zeile had a few days off
for baseball's All-Star break, they took Hannah to see a doctor.
Turned out, she had a high blood-sugar count.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   The next two days, as Hannah was admitted to the Children's
Diabetes Center at UCLA, the couple learned all they could about
the disease, which affects more than a million Americans and is one
of the most costly and chronic diseases of childhood. Treatment is
lifelong.
</P>
<P>
   When Todd went back to play for the Texas Rangers, the family,
along with 5-year-old son Garrett, followed him this time so both
parents could monitor Hannah's progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of maintenance,'' Zeile, the former Dodger and
current New York Mets first baseman admitted the other day after a
game in St. Louis, where he again was on the road, in a hotel room,
wondering about his daughter's health.
</P>
<P>
   ``She gets two insulin shots a day, plus as many as six tests.
We're lucky she's a really good eater because they need a
regimented diet. But there can be so many factors that affect her
sugar count aside from food - even things like altitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a constant worry. And she's at an age where she
can't tell us how she feels. There were plenty of times we'd do
tests and she'd be fine during the day, then we'd test her at 2
a.m. and find it to be abnormal, so all of the sudden we can't
sleep that night.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Zeile says Hannah today is an otherwise typical
terrible 2-year-old, ``very willful, a real tiger, with a brother
who's a real instigator.''
</P>
<P>
   He also calls her ``a tough little trooper.''
</P>
<P>
   Hannah's inspiration, and the work of the Children's Diabetes
Center at UCLA, was more than enough to get Zeile to pull a few
strings with the Dodgers today to help raise some money for the
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't been with the team for a couple of seasons now, but
the former Hart High and UCLA star didn't feel awkward asking the
Dodgers if the foundation could buy a block of reserve-level
tickets for tonight's game - against his Mets - and resell them
through the UCLA central ticket office for $25, with $10 of it tax
deductible.
</P>
<P>
   About 4,000 tickets were bought; most have already been sold,
but some are still available for order - at (310) 825-2101 or
www.cto.ucla.edu - and can be picked up before the game at will
call.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation also sold out 400 VIP packages ranging from
$1,000 to $2,500 that include luxury suite seats, special pregame
privileges and admission to a postgame reception and silent
auction.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it helped that Dodgers second baseman Mark Grudzielanek
went to bat for Zeile on the fund-raising effort. But Grudzielanek
has something at stake, too. His brother Tim was diagnosed with
diabetes at age 7 and continues to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Dodgers) were great from the word 'go,' '' said Zeile of
setting up the charity event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a great relationship with him since his playing days
here,'' said Derrick Hall, the Dodgers' director of communications.
``In our opinion, he'll always be part of the Dodger family.
Anything we could do to help, we feel honored.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact he and Mark are teaming up shows the sincerity and
passion they have for their cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeile says there's a good chance this event could raise more
than $300,000 for the center, headed by Dr. Kevin Kaiserman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am extremely thankful to Todd and Mark,'' said Dr.
Kaiserman. ``Their selfless dedication in helping to fight this
devastating disease serves as an inspiration and example to us
all.''

CHACON-LOPEZ SHOWDOWN SHOOK L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One reason the boxing community is so excited
about the June 17 bout between Oscar De La Hoya and Shane Mosley at
Staples Center is that the city has been starving for a truly big
fight.
</P>
<P>
   How long has the hunger lasted? Try 26 years this month.
</P>
<P>
   It was in May 1974 that rising prospects Bobby Chacon of Pacoima
and Danny ``Little Red'' Lopez of Alhambra thrilled a packed Sports
Arena crowd in perhaps the biggest fight in Los Angeles until now.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya-Mosley will dwarf Chacon-Lopez in terms of the money
it will generate and the ungodly sums the fighters will earn.
</P>
<P>
   However, the earlier fight, which took place during a time when
boxing still rivaled the major sports in the mainstream, created a
stir that not even the popular De La Hoya could hope to eclipse.
</P>
<P>
   Chacon, 22 at the time, had been beaten only by the great Ruben
Olivares in 24 fights, while the big-punching Lopez, 21, was
unbeaten and had knocked out all but one of his 23 opponents.
</P>
<P>
   They, like De La Hoya and Mosley, were produced in the L.A.
area. Chacon was reared in the Valley while Lopez moved to town
from Utah as a young amateur and was based here throughout his
career.
</P>
<P>
   And they both were weaned in regular shows here, not in Las
Vegas or at various casinos as most of the big-name fighters are
today.
</P>
<P>
   They graduated from four-rounders to championship bouts before
the appreciative eyes of local boxing fans and their legends grew
with each convincing victory. They were stars even before they
became champions.[p The fans couldn't wait to see them rumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I remember most is the demand that the fight be
made,'' the matchmaker of the bout, Don Chargin, said after the
Golden State Boxer's Association honored Chacon and Lopez at a
luncheon last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember (promoter) Aileen Eaton calling me into her office
and saying, `I know you don't want to make this fight now (because
it's too early in their careers). We !ital!have!off! to make it.
The public is demanding it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``They were both really celebrities in town.''
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude of the bout wasn't lost on the fighters or their
camps.
</P>
<P>
   The day Lopez's manager, Howie Steindler, signed for the fight
in Chargin's office and then realized what he'd one, he fainted.
</P>
<P>
   He had reason to be worried.
</P>
<P>
   Chacon was the favorite of the 16,080 that crammed into the
Sports Arena and the thousands of spill-over fans who watched on
closed circuit at the Olympic Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   And he didn't disappoint them. Chacon, who later became a
slugger, gave Lopez a boxing lesson before finally taking him out
in the ninth round with a series of big rights.
</P>
<P>
   Referee John Thomas stopped it with Lopez leaning helplessly
against the ropes and Chacon firing away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sparred with Danny all the time (in the years) before the
fight,'' said Chacon, who survives on a small disability pension
because of punch- induced dementia but is able to work with kids in
a downtown gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``And day in and day out he'd whup me. Then one day his manager,
Howie Steindler, said, `no more sparring with Chacon because he
knew we would fight one day.'
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time I fought him, I was a lot better. It wasn't like
the gym.'' Lopez, now in construction and living in Chino Hills,
would agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember I just couldn't hit the guy,'' he said. ``He always
gave me motion. He was a good boxer.''
</P>
<P>
   Chacon would go on to win the featherweight title that year, as
would Lopez a few years later.
</P>
<P>
   However, such fights as the one in 1974 became increasingly rare
in L.A. as the hub of boxing moved to Las Vegas, Atlantic City,
N.J., and other gambling-oriented towns willing to pay large fees
to stage fights.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the days when boxing fans here could see their
favorite, big- name boxers fighting in weekly shows around town, at
the Sports Arena, Forum, Olympic and the old Music Center in
Woodland Hills, as well as other venues.
</P>
<P>
   Again, local talent was developed locally.
</P>
<P>
   And the media - including a half-dozen major newspapers -
devoted much more time and space to boxing than they do today.
Chargin said not a day went be in the month before the Chacon-Lopez
fight without an article or radio report on it.
</P>
<P>
   It all contributed to an unforgettable fight - and era.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is (De La Hoya-Mosley) different (from Chacon-Lopez)? Yes, it
is,'' said Don Fraser, Eaton's rival promoter. ``Chacon had all but
one fight locally. Lopez, I think, had every fight here. Between
them, they had 40-some local fights. De La Hoya and Mosley I don't
think have 10 local fights (actually 22 in the area).
</P>
<P>
   ``De La Hoya is big, but if Mosley walked in here, no one would
know who he is. It'll be the biggest local fight for monetary
reasons, but it's not the same as those days.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid watch: We might have seen the last of David Reid at 154
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Goossen, Reid's promoter, said an unusually low percentage
of body fat - 2.9 percent, according to recent tests - means the
former junior middleweight champ will have to move up to 160
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``That test was done while he wasn't training,'' Goossen said.
``Imagine what it would be like if he were training.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he trains, he burns off muscle tissue, not fat, and we
want to burn off fat. He'll be 10 times stronger if he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Goossen suggested the body-fat revelation might explain why he
faded in his loss to Felix Trinidad in his last fight, which sounds
more like damage control than reality.
</P>
<P>
   It was a big punch by Trinidad that hurt Reid and changed the
course of the bout.
</P>
<P>
   However, it will be interesting to see how he performs at 160
and the impact his arrival will have on the division.
</P>
<P>
   ``He immediately makes the middleweight division something to
look at,'' Goossen said.
</P>
<P>
   Goossen said he hopes to have Reid back in the ring at 160
pounds by August.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbit punches: David Tua, deemed the biggest threat to
heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis, faces Obed Sullivan on Saturday
in Las Vegas on Showtime.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, a veteran heavyweight, would appear to be in over his
head but seems to understand the gravity of his situation.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the prospect of turning his career around with a
surprise victory is his primary incentive, Sullivan said: ``Just
watching Tua fight, just knowing what he's capable of doing is
incentive enough. You can't play around in a fight like this, you
have to concentrate. If not, guess what? You might be looking up at
someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Look for that to happen Saturday. ...
</P>
<P>
   Robert Garcia of Oxnard, coming off his loss to Diego Corrales,
returns to the ring against Ben Tackie in a 10-round lightweight
bout on the Tua-Sullivan undercard.
</P>
<P>
   Goossen, Garcia's promoter, said his fighter might move down to
130 to challenge junior lightweight champ Joel Casamayor if he wins
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   One reason Garcia lost to Corrales is that he had a terrible
time making weight. He reportedly was eating only one meal a day
leading up to the fight.
</P>
<P>
   He's better off trying his luck at 135.

USC WINS REGIONAL BASEBALL FINAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS COCOLES  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FULLERTON, Calif. _ The inaugural NCAA baseball Super Regionals
weren't too terrific for USC in 1999. In fact, they were a
downright bummer.
</P>
<P>
   The then-defending national champions were sent to Stanford and
eliminated in two games the Trojans thought they should have won.
</P>
<P>
   USC gets a second chance after defeating host Cal State
Fullerton 8-3 on Sunday in a regional final before 2,177 at Goodwin
Field.
</P>
<P>
   The top-seeded Trojans (41-18) travel to Georgia Tech in a
best-of-three Super Regional beginning Friday in Atlanta. The
series winner advances to the College World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bitterly frustrating weekend,'' Trojans coach Mike
Gillespie said of 1-0 and 5-3 losses to Stanford last year that
included a near no-hitter by Barry Zito in the opener.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans were not only unhappy about playing a Pacific-10
Conference rival but also a fellow top 10-caliber team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt, not like we were cheated, but we had a really good
team and nobody on that team thought it was fair at all that we had
to lose two tough games,'' said junior shortstop Seth Davidson,
named the Fullerton regional's most outstanding player. ``That was
Omaha for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The way the Trojans are playing now, getting to Omaha might be a
foregone conclusion even with a formidable Super Regional opponent
in Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   USC is on a 13-game winning streak, including three regional
victories over Virginia Tech, Loyola Marymount and Cal State
Fullerton by a combined score of 29-11.
</P>
<P>
   A balanced offensive attack was the most impressive part of
USC's dominance against what was considered one of the strongest of
16, four-team regionals.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-8-9 hitters in the lineup Alberto Concepcion, Abel
Martinez and Brian Barre - went 17 for 31 with 14 runs scored in
three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awesome. Just think if we all hit,'' said Davidson, who
batted .714 (10 for 14) with a homer and six RBI. ``That's kind of
how it's been the past 13 games. Somebody different gets the job
done for us.''
</P>
<P>
   USC batted .427 (47 for 110) as a team despite the struggles of
top hitters Anthony Lunetta (.167), Josh Persell (.182) and Beau
Craig (.214).
</P>
<P>
   The top third of the order had the big hits against the Titans
(38-21). Davidson went 3 for 4 with two runs scored, Rob Garibaldi
2 for 4 and Justin Gemoll 3 for 4 with four RBI.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, Gillespie has options when filling out his
lineup card.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 7-8-9 slots in our lineup will be hitting 1-2-3 next
week,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The effectiveness of the Trojans' offense took its toll on
Titans' starter Jon Smith (9-3), who allowed six earned runs on
eight hits in 3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   For the third consecutive day, the Trojans fell behind 2-0, but
Montanez hit a solo homer, the first of his collegiate career, in
the third to spark a three-run inning.
</P>
<P>
   Persell, a Montclair Prep graduate who resides in Sherman Oaks,
hit a solo homer in the fourth to start another three-run rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fastball wasn't quite what it normally is. I just couldn't
get it by them. That's a good offensive team. I have to give them
credit,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Reyes (6-6), a freshman from Whittier, pitched five-plus
solid innings, allowing two runs on seven hits with five strikeouts
to earn the win.

MARTINEZ BESTS CLEMENS AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It took 179 minutes, nine innings, 255 pitches, 22
strikeouts, seven Cy Young trophies, and dozens of thrills and
chills to establish what we already knew.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez is king of the hill. A-No. 1. Cream of the crop.
Top of the heap. Start spreading the news. In what can only be
described as one of the greatest regular-season games in 100 years
of American League play, Pedro Sunday &UR;  &LR; night bested five-time Cy
Brother Roger Clemens, 2-0, at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In this lifetime, we are not likely to see a better early-season
matchup. Baseball is a six-month marathon of 162 games, but this
night offered a full year's worth of hardball history, tradition,
and talent. When will we ever again get Rocket and Pedro _ the once
and present aces of the Red Sox staff _ dueling in a sold-out
Yankee Stadium on Memorial Day weekend with first place hanging in
the balance? It was Ali-Frazier on God's green grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the best regular-season game I've ever seen,'' said
Boston pitching coach Joe Kerrigan. ``It's one for the ages. Great
for baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is good for baseball,'' said Martinez. ``The fans came out
and clapped for both of us. I tried to give them what they want. We
were feeding off each other the whole game. (Clemens) was not going
to give you much to work with.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time there was anything like this probably was in 1912
when Smoky Joe Wood beat Walter Johnson, 1-0, in a packed,
state-of-the-art Fenway Park (Sox ownership claimed it needed the
new park to stay competitive in the AL and Honey Fitz was a bigger
fan than Mayor Menino). It was Wood's 15th consecutive win,
bringing him within one of the Big Train's record. Carl Hubbell and
Dizzy Dean matched up regularly and there was a Juan Marichal vs.
Warren Spahn battle in the early 1960s that is still recalled.
</P>
<P>
   How good was it? It was still 0-0 after eight and Clemens was
winning on strikeouts and style points. But Trot Nixon hit a
two-out, two-run homer in the top of the ninth. Pedro loaded the
bases in the bottom of the ninth, but would not come out. He got
Tino Martinez to ground to second to end it.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes. Pedro had the flu. That must be why he walked one guy
while striking out nine and lowering his ERA to 1.05. He also
retired 15 out of 16 before the ninth and threw 97 miles per hour
in the final frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was one of those games where if you wanted a sandwich,
you wanted to have somebody get it for you,'' said Sox manager Jimy
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Jimy's counterpart, Joe Torre, said, ``I think it's a game that
everyone should look back on and be glad you were here.''
</P>
<P>
   It was certainly nothing like the October '99 blowout when the
Rocket was shaving before the third inning ended. Clemens went the
distance Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, fanning 13 before Nixon rocked him in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Even the pregame warmups were intriguing. At 10 minutes to 8,
both Clemens and Pedro were in left center, long tossing. They were
almost side-by-side at one point, and Pedro looked tiny in Roger's
monstrous moonshadow.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was into it from the start. Brave Bostonians, wearing
Sox caps, cheered with gusto when Pedro was announced. Red-clad
K-Kids and Pedro's Dominican countrymen danced in the left-field
bleachers. It was nothing like the reception Clemens got in Boston
in October.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro has a New York state of mind. He loves the Dominican
flavor in the stands and the knowledge of Yankee fans. The feeling
is mutual. Like the Yankees themselves, New York fans haven't
forgotten his mastery of Sept. 10, 1999 (17 strikeouts). Seeing
Pedro back on the Yankee Stadium mound was a little like the
Beatles' second appearance on the ``Ed Sullivan Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yankees are a great team,'' said Pedro. ``I've only been
here three years. I wasn't here when the rivalry started. My
rivalry is against everybody. But I love watching these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   And he loves pitching against them.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro gave up a scratch single to Derek Jeter in the first, but
Jeter was erased on a double play. Both pitchers faced the minimum
in the first two innings.
</P>
<P>
   By the third inning, the right-field bleacher chant was ``We
Want Beer.'' (New rules make brew a banned substance in the
bleachers.) Meanwhile, an upper deck banner reminded Bostonians,
``Roger gets his ring tomorrow _ only in New York.'' The Yankees
are holding their 1999 ring ceremony today before they play the
Oakland A's.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens got the Sox in order again in the third, then came a
stunner: Pedro walked Shane Spencer to open the bottom of the
inning. It was like seeing Larry Bird miss a foul shot in the final
minute of a playoff game. Pedro settled down and got the next three
hitters.
</P>
<P>
   The first man to reach scoring position was Jeter (who had three
of New York's four hits), who doubled to open the fourth. He was
stranded on second as New York's 3-4-5 hitters failed to get the
ball out of the infield. Pedro fanned Paul O'Neill, got Bernie
Williams on a popup, then struck out Jorge Posada on a hellacious
breaking pitch. The Yankee catcher almost fell down swinging and
missing.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro's ninth was a wild ride. He hit leadoff man Chuck
Knoblauch with an 0-2 pitch, then surrendered a single to right to
the estimable Jeter. After a mound visit from Jimy (``I told him,
`Let me go after this guy' '' _ Pedro), Martinez fanned O'Neill
(swinging) then got Bernie Williams on a fly to right. He hit
Posada with a 1-2 pitch to load the bases, then got Tino Martinez
to ground out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sweated a little bit in that inning,'' Pedro said. ``I
didn't want to do what Roger did. Nixon was getting good hacks and
he made a mistake and it cost him the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan's right. It was a duel for the ages. Do not expect to
see its likes again.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the 77 years since its doors opened, there have
been 30 championship bouts at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous was when Joe Louis knocked out Max Schmeling in
1938, a two-fisted message to Adolf Hitler that his theory of Aryan
supremacy wasn't all it was cracked up to be.
</P>
<P>
   There was no title belt at stake Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, but this may
well be remembered as the second-best: Pedro Martinez, the
Dominican flyweight, and Roger Clemens, the Texas heavywight,
exchanging electrifying haymakers for eight scoreless innings until
Trot Nixon delivered the knockout punch, a ninth-inning, two-out,
two-run home run off Clemens that gave the Sox a 2-0 win over the
Yankees in a game that achieved instant classic status while the
sellout crowd of 55,339 was still on the premises.
</P>
<P>
   There was a message in this decision, too. It came from Nixon,
who took exception to Clemens screaming at him for daring to look
askance at a pitch in the first inning, when he was called out on
strikes, the first of Clemens' 13 K's on the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He mentioned something about that,'' said Jeff Frye, who
reached safely when Clemens couldn't handle his two-out comebacker
to the mound, giving Nixon his chance to launch his sixth home run
of the season deep into the right-field bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trot's a very intense individual. He took it personally. I
like to see that in a young guy. This was a big night for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon was called out on a full count in the first, and heard
Clemens bark at him as he returned to the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said something during my first at-bat,'' Nixon said. ``I
don't know what I did. I guess he yelled, `That's a strike.' I show
him a lot of respect. I give him respect. If he doesn't respect me,
that's fine. It's a war out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon struck out again in the fourth, when he returned to the
dugout and wiped out a row of paper cups with the only actual punch
thrown all night.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went up there for my third at-bat,'' said Nixon, who
tripled in the seventh but was left stranded when Clemens struck
out Brian Daubach and Nomar Garciaparra, ``I said to myself,
`Enough of this. I've got to attack the ball. Don't look at who's
on the mound.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, who used a devastating splitter to register his most
K's since putting on pinstripes a year ago, was one out away from
finishing a 1-2-3 ninth when Frye's one-hop grounder bounced off
his glove and rolled toward third base.
</P>
<P>
   Frye, who one pitch earlier had failed to convince plate umpire
Brian Runge that he'd been hit by a pitch on his left hand, was
credited with an infield hit, only the fourth Sox hit of the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as it hit his glove, it was obvious he didn't know
where the ball was,'' Nixon said. ``I knew (Scott) Brosius was
playing deep, so he had no shot at Frye.''
</P>
<P>
   Given one final shot at Clemens, Nixon connected. It was the
second home run of his career against the Rocket. And yes, he
acknowledged, for now it ranks as the biggest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether he respects me or not, that's fine,'' Nixon said. ``I
have to earn my respect. It was a mistake pitch. He knows it, I
know it. It was probably a pitch he didn't want to throw there, and
I was able to put the bat on the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The whole exchange was reminiscent of last season, when Clemens
hit rookie Wilton Veras in the back with a pitch after yelling at
Veras for taking too hard a swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand that, a pitcher throwing at a hitter
because he took a big swing,'' Nixon said. ``He's an intense
player, and so am I. I guess he can yell as much as he wants.
That's fine and dandy. But that kind of fired me up.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens claimed to have no idea what Nixon was talking about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I said anything to Trot,'' he said. ``I talk
to myself a lot out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens gave up five hits, did not walk a batter, and threw 127
pitches, 76 for strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who has not allowed the Yankees a run in the last 25
innings he's pitched against them, struck out nine and allowed four
hits. He walked one and hit two in running his record to 8-2 with
his third complete game of the season. Martinez threw 128 pitches,
88 for strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees pinned Martinez to the ropes in the bottom of the
ninth, when he hit Chuck Knoblauch with an 0-and-2 pitch and Derek
Jeter singled to right with no outs. Jimy Williams, playing the
Burgess Meredith role as Martinez's cornerman, strode to the mound
for a visit, but left his ace in to face the heart of the Yankee
order.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked me what I wanted to do,'' said Martinez, who admitted
to exhaustion. ``I said, `Let me go after them.' In the ninth
inning, you want to go with the best that you have. You want to
have something left.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez struck out Paul O'Neill on three pitches, then held his
breath as Bernie Williams launched a deep drive that died on the
warning track in right.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter stole second with Jorge Posada at the plate, but Martinez
was one strike away from victory when he hit Posada in the left
elbow with a 1-and-2 changeup, loading the bases.
</P>
<P>
   There was one last heart-stopping moment for the Sox when Tino
Martinez grounded to second base. Frye fielded the ball cleanly,
then double-pumped before throwing to first baseman Mike Stanley,
barely getting the out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stan-o's foot slipped when he got to the bag,'' Frye said. ``I
was going to throw the ball, but I waited.''
</P>
<P>
   Frye smiled when asked how this compared with Pedro-Rocket I, a
13-1 Red Sox rout in the ALCS.
</P>
<P>
   ``This meant more to me tonight,'' he said. ``Last year, I
wasn't eligible to play. I asked a couple of teammates if that's
what it was like to be in the playoffs.''

WHAT PHIL REALLY THINKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thanks to a computer glitch that may be descended from the I
Love You (but only for your money)'' virus, e-mails sent Sunday
were mistakenly delivered to wrong addresses. One that fell into my
queue apparently was a message from Lakers coach Phil Jackson to a
friend in Montana. It was unsigned, of course, but it sure sounded
like Jackson, and the 'net handle was Zenmasterhoops.netz. In the
spirit of public disclosure, I chose to share it, purely for
entertainment value. Enjoy. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dear Running Jay: I hope this e-mail finds you well. How are
Sacheen and the children? Did Little Hops get the CD I burned for
him? I found some trippy little jazz vinyl shop on Melrose. The
hiss is wonderful. I hope he enjoys it.
</P>
<P>
   We beat Portland today to go up 3-1 in the Western Conference
finals. It was probably our best overall performance of the season.
There is nothing like going into an opponent's house and turning a
rally into a funeral. Michael and I would often talk about how
deadly a road win can be.
</P>
<P>
   I have to admit, there are times when I believe I am stealing
money from Jerry Buss, the nice owner of the team. He has been very
accommodating to me, and oh-so thankful for how far we've come this
season after all of the anguish of the previous three.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is, I'm the fortunate one. When Michael decided to
retire, the two best players in the league under 30 were Shaquille
O'Neal and Kobe Bryant. If I was going to return to coaching after
my one-year sabbatical, it was either going to be in New York where
I played or with a team that had a leg up on a winning a title.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the kind of thing I would have ever said for public
consumption, of course, because being under 30, neither Shaq nor
Kobe had the maturity yet to deal with that kind of identity.
Michael's mind had to catch up with his talent before he became the
player he was. People always talk about his superb talent, but the
truth is that Michael was a warrior.
</P>
<P>
   Shaq and Kobe are incredibly gifted. I'm not sure there has ever
been a big man in the NBA that can do all that Shaquille can do.
Did you see that spin move he put on Brian Grant Sunday? A man that
big shouldn't be allowed to be that nimble. He's a genetic freak of
nature, and I am so lucky to have him.
</P>
<P>
   But the best thing about Shaq is that he's the son of a marine.
He can be goofy at times, endearingly so, but he has this amazing
work ethic and courage underneath it all. All he's ever wanted and
needed, I believe, is confidence in what he's asked to do and trust
in the person asking it.
</P>
<P>
   I always thought he was the perfect center for the triangle
offense. When you throw the ball into Shaq, what's the defense
supposed to do? Two years ago, I wondered if he was smart enough to
know what he can and can't do to become a winner. But he's been
perfect. He submitted to the triangle.
</P>
<P>
   I was more worried about the other lad because he's been
compared to Michael so often, and that's so terribly unfair. My
challenge was getting him to understand that the measure of the man
was winning, not highlight reels.
</P>
<P>
   They have become warriors. In Game 3 Friday, both men had to
extend themselves beyond the scoresheet to win. We won that game
because Shaq didn't dwell on his first half, because both men were
willing to give the ball up to the open man when we needed a
basket, and because each made great defensive plays at the end.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe blocking a shot by that mastodon Sabonis Friday was all
warrior charisma, a moment similar to Michael stealing the ball
from Karl Malone in the final game in the 1998 playoffs. And Shaq's
free throws Sundays may not be the way he prefers to dominate, but
a hammer is a hammer.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the team has been the same kind of puzzle I had in
Chicago. You have all these spare parts, and the challenge is to
make them work together. I always thought Glen Rice was a perfect
player for the triangle, and he is, but just not as reliable as I'd
like.
</P>
<P>
   The other fellows play hard. They don't like the way I use them
all the time, but the other Bulls didn't like a lot of the
decisions I made, either. L.A. is supposed to be laid-back, but
players are players wherever they play. They don't like to sit and
they chafe at my decisions. Many still don't understand the Zen
philosophy, that you have to be here for what you can do at this
moment.
</P>
<P>
   I do not think we would be in this position if not for Ron
Harper. He never got the credit he deserved in Chicago for being
such a steady player in an offense that asked him to sublimate. We
wouldn't be here, either, if not for Jerry West. How many de facto
general managers are secure enough to let someone coach the team
the way he sees fit?
</P>
<P>
   The only downside has been a tendency for the media out here to
wail every time we lose a game. They've been brain-washed to expect
the worst, I imagine. Truthfully, I've used this to my advantage a
few times. I think the players now know these are the things you
deal with when you lose.
</P>
<P>
   We have beaten Portland to the point where they wonder if
they're good enough, and resolved all of our own conflicts. All
that's left is the winning.
</P>
<P>
   I'll see you and the family this summer. I'll bring Dennis with
me for some fresh air and rehab, if I can find him.
</P>
<P>
   Yours, Phil.

ADVICE MAKES FREE THROWS SLAM DUNK FOR SHAQ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ Shaquille O'Neal has grown weary of advice on
foul shooting, but Sunday morning he got a good tip from an
unlikely, but welcome, source - his daughter, Taahirah.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter's 3 years old, and of course she really doesn't
know the game,'' O'Neal said. ``But today I called and I said,
`Daddy loves you.' And she said, `Good luck, bend your knees.' ''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal then simulated his response: A ``What?'' and a stunned
look. But obviously daughter knew best - Daddy made all nine of his
free throws to lead the Los Angeles Lakers to their 103-91 victory
over the Portland Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   It was O'Neal's best free-throw performance ever in a big
playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   ``So that game was for her,'' O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, for Portland coach Mike Dunleavy. O'Neal was 3 for 3 when
Dunleavy went to the ``Hack-a-Shaq'' routine, ordering intentional
fouls midway through the fourth quarter. O'Neal calmly sank both
and smiled, then finished out the string perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like Pete Maravich, that guy from LSU,'' he said with a
laugh. ``I had a rhythm going. ... I think if I develop some
consistency, then I can become a great player in this league one
day.''
</P>
<P>
   He also might put an end to the intentional fouling that has at
times frustrated him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, that's the answer right there,'' said Dunleavy, who used
the tactic 12 times in Game 1. ``It's not the league making new
rules, it's not anything else. That's the answer. You make free
throws, and it makes it tough on other teams to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Phil Jackson proudly noted that the strategy ``really
backfired today on them, and it really sewed the game up for us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to take (O'Neal) out early so he could keep that stat
sheet for him,'' Jackson said. ``We told him to put that on the
wall, frame that one.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparring: It was another day of exchanged glares, occasional
smiles and a little smack talk between Jackson and his former
Chicago Bulls pupil, Portland's Scottie Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two good friends, that's all that was,'' said Bulls alumnus
and current Laker Ron Harper.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who had dubbed the Blazers ``jackals'' for celebrating
their Game 2 win in L.A., joked Sunday that Pippen was the ``lead
jackal,'' but downplayed their mini-rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing there, just looking at each other, kind
of,'' he said. ``We weren't conversing, just kind of checking each
other out. There was nothing to be said. Scottie's playing really
hard, and I was just checking out how he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepping up: Harper made his biggest contribution of the
postseason, scoring 18 points on 6-of-12 shooting to go with seven
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really can't say enough about Ronnie's game,'' Jackson said.
``He had foul trouble early in the game and the middle of the game.
And we just played him anyway with four fouls at one point in the
third quarter, simply because Brian Shaw (serving a suspension)
wasn't here, they were taking advantage of Derek Fisher down in the
post with Bonzi Wells the first half. And Ron just kept playing
better as the game went on.''

CLEMENS HASN'T LOST IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Almost 15 minutes had passed since members of the
media were allowed into the New York clubhouse before Roger Clemens
strode in and went to his locker along the back wall. His
appearance following Sunday &UR;  &LR; night's 2-0 defeat to Pedro Martinez
and the Red Sox brought life to a locker room cloaked in somber
silence and filled with awkward glances.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a black T-shirt with the sleeves cut off, his oversized
biceps were clearly visible. His pitching arm was a solid block of
bright red, showing the effects of a postgame icing. Before facing
a throng of questioners, he brushed back his spiky brown hair and
donned a well-worn Yankees cap. A lone security man kept reporters
at bay until Clemens was ready to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good game,'' said Clemens. ``That's the way it's
supposed to be. Those 12-10 ballgames, you don't want to be in
those. You want to be in those ballgames right there. That was a
fun game to pitch in. The intensity was every bit of what it was
supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The much-anticipated rematch between Clemens and Martinez _ who
met in last year's AL Championship Series _ lived up to all the
billing. While Clemens had made an early exit in the previous
meeting, a Boston rout, Sunday &UR;  &LR; night he matched Martinez all night
long. Almost. Clemens pitched all nine innings and logged 127
pitches, racking up 13 strikeouts and allowing just five hits and
two earned runs. Two runs too many.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs in the ninth inning of a 0-0 game, Trot Nixon sent
a 2-1 fastball into the right-field stands to spoil Clemens's
sparkling performance. However, it was the single by the previous
batter, Jeff Frye, that Clemens referred to as ``the only thing
disappointing about the night.'' On that play, Clemens fumbled a
comebacker to allow Frye to reach.
</P>
<P>
   But those two plays _ and the loss that resulted _ took little
away from Clemens's outing. It was arguably his best performance in
pinstripes. The 13 strikeouts were a season high, and Sunday &UR;  &LR; night
was his second 10-strikeout game as a Yankee and the 95th of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a classic. No question,'' said Yankees manager Joe
Torre. ``I hope to hell that it puts to rest all the questions
about Roger. It was an inspired performance on both sides, and
somebody had to lose, unfortunately. It was a great game. I sure as
hell wanted to win the thing. Nobody has to be ashamed of the
result. It definitely was a playoff atmosphere. The players felt
it. Everybody was pumped up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we came out of this series knowing that these two
teams are going to be fighting for it to the end. It's a game that
I think everybody will look back on, and you should all be happy
that you were here to witness it. It certainly lived up to
everything it was supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the last time Martinez and Clemens faced off, the
sing-song chants of ``Roger, Roger'' seemed to spur the Yankees ace
on, though the loss dropped Clemens to 4-5.
</P>
<P>
   His legs became a little tired, but his arm felt good until the
end. ``Our fans here are great, and that always gets you fired
up,'' said Clemens. ``That's why I enjoy pitching here the most. I
need to try to keep that level when I'm pitching on the road. It
was everything it was supposed to be . . . You want to go out there
and throw zeros, for sure. You think it's going to be that way.
It's supposed to be that way. That's why all those people were in
those stands tonight. You want to give them something fun to take
home.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt that the 55,339 fans at Yankee Stadium
Sunday &UR;  &LR; night will be keeping the ticket stubs they brought home.

SOLDIERS FROM FOUR WARS REFLECT ON EXPERIENCES
</HEADLINE>
 EDITORS: Resending to correct ninth graf. 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOLLY ANDRES, JESSE HIESTAND, JASON KANDEL, ROB MONROE, RICK
ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Memories fade. The soldiers who desperately fought
to save a country, and to save their lives, die of old age.
Generations grow up without ever facing the consequences of war.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of reasons why a nation can forget about the
service _ and the sacrifices _ of its soldiers. But not today, not
on Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   Today, our nation remembers the soldiers. We remember the heroic
battles they fought, the ideals they upheld. And we remember the
ultimate sacrifices more than 1 million American soldiers have
made.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the stories of five veterans who served the country
during World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War and the
Persian Gulf War. These are tales they no doubt will share with
other veterans and their loved ones when they stop to honor
veterans of years past.
</P>
<P>
   Because on Memorial Day, at least, we remember. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHARLES FARINA
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't think about his last combat mission every day, and he
was almost scared to death when he went out on his first combat
mission. But Charles J. Farina would serve the country again if he
was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 78. I'd pick up a rifle again. My wife might kill me
first, but I'd do it again if I was asked to. I've never regretted
the experience,'' said Farina, who was an infantryman in Europe
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Farina was working at an aircraft company in Baltimore when he
was drafted on June 16, 1944. Until then, he had received
deferments because his work was considered vital to national
defense. He doesn't remember his emotions when he received his
draft notice, but he wasn't totally surprised.
</P>
<P>
   This was shortly after the D-Day landing. ``A lot of our men
were killed and deferments were canceled after that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had 17 weeks of basic training at Camp Blanding in Florida.
Infantry training. I was 21 at the time. After basic training, I
was shipped over to France,'' said Farina, who now does volunteer
work during the week at the Don Tuttle Senior Center near his home
in Burbank, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wound up in the 84th Infantry Division under Gen. George
Clark. I saw action in Belgium. I was wounded near Liege, Belgium.
I was wounded twice within about 10 to 15 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Farina said his division had cleared out a wooded area before
advancing on the German-occupied city in eastern Belgium, near the
Dutch border.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first wound I received was shrapnel to my right knee.
Really busted it up. Then, on the way down the mountainside, I was
hit again at the back of the neck. Shrapnel went through my
clothing. It was cold at the time, it might have snowed. We were
all wearing two shirts and two jackets. After I was hit the second
time, I woke up in a foxhole. The date was Jan. 4, 1945.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I had been taken to an evacuation hospital, I remember a
doctor telling me that my dog tags saved my life. The shrapnel had
broken the chain. But I was paralyzed from the waist up for roughly
five or six months. I eventually ended up in five different
hospitals in England. All of a sudden, one morning, I woke up and
the paralysis was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The whole experience ``stayed in my mind for a while,'' he said.
``It scared me.''
</P>
<P>
   Farina received the Combat Infantry medal and the Purple Heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was one of the lucky ones; I came home. My friends died,''
said Farina. As he talked, he wondered aloud that he was getting
choked up recalling his experiences ``after all this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking about Memorial Day, Farina said, ``To older people,
especially those who had been in the service, it's a big thing. But
the younger generation don't put much thought in it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MITSU USUI
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1946 and Mitsu Usui, a Japanese-American who served
with the U.S. Army in World II, was on his way home and about to
realize he still had a battle to fight.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old had just been honorably discharged after his
stint as an interpreter in an Army intelligence unit. He hopped on
a Los Angeles bus to head home.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that a woman who saw him snarled, ``Another goddamn
Jap,'' the 84-year-old Usui recalled at the San Fernando Valley
Japanese-American Community Service Center, where the Veterans of
Foreign Wars Post 4140 meets.
</P>
<P>
   Usui had been a young businessman when he and his family were
placed in an internment camp in Colorado in 1942. Anti-Japanese
sentiment was so high that in Los Angeles, Chinese-Americans wore
placards reading ``I'm Chinese'' to avoid being mistaken for
Japanese, he remembers. Usui volunteered for the Army while in the
camp anyway. An all-Japanese unit was forming, and young men like
him wanted to prove their patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the best showcase to show we're American,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Usui served for three years, seeing action in Okinawa just
before the end of the war. He believes Japanese-American soldiers
fought with just as much, if not more, heart than other soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   After Usui heard that woman's slur, the furious driver stopped
the bus. He demanded that she either apologize to Usui or get off.
She got off.
</P>
<P>
   Usui still thinks about confronting her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was interesting that even after the fighting, she sees me
as a Jap,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the woman left, Usui turned around to thank the driver, a
white man. The driver wore a lapel pin. It signified that he, too,
was an Army veteran.

   ``ATLANTIC MONTHLY''
</P>
<P>
   Fascinating cover story suggests that the Unabomber was actually
born at Harvard, which gave Ted Kaczynski his first taste of higher
education. Story notes that Kaczynski, who was 16 when he arrived
in Cambridge, Mass., was the subject of a brutal series of
psychological tests that may have started him down the road to
mental illness. His anti-technology bent also may have formed there
as a reaction to curriculum that preached that science was the one
true belief and faith and morality were just window dressing. It's
interesting to note that the piece is written by Alston Chase, a
Harvard graduate and mathematician who, like Kaczynski, moved to
the Montana wilderness in the early 1970s. Another story calls
White working class males the ``forgotten majority.''

<P>
   ``NEW YORKER''
</P>
<P>
   Long piece questions the actions of Desert Storm Gen. Barry
McCaffrey, noting that his 24th Infantry Division attacked a line
of retreating Iraqi vehicles and troops for several hours with
hardly any response from the Iraqis. The attack came two days after
the cease-fire, and officers and enlisted men interviewed later
said there was little or no Iraqi fire at all. Piece also notes
that McCaffrey's troops also opened fire on unarmed prisoners near
a hospital bus, though McCaffrey, who is now President Clinton's
drug czar, was not on the scene. The story was written by Seymour
M. Hersh, who conducted hundreds of interviews. In a fun read,
Edward Hoagland writes a memoir of the time he literally ran away
and joined the circus.

   We have to admit we were hoping for a how-to guide with this
one, but instead we got a dopey feature on Greg Norman. ``Greg
Norman is his name, and golf is his game,'' the story opines. Wow.
Point of the story seems to be that Norman has made a lot of money
selling his shark clothes and building golf courses hither and yon.
He also gets around in style, owning a Gulfstream jet, a
helicopter, a boat, three Harleys, two Jet Skis and a partridge in
a pear tree. OK, we made that last one up. They also pin down
filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola for a Q-and-A and quiz him about
wine. This is the guy who directed The Godfather(beginitalic),
(enditalic)and we're asking him about grapes? Yee-ipes. The
magazine also advises that ``buying a private isle can be hard
work, but the rewards are well worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``VANITY FAIR''
</P>
<P>
   In kind of a neat feature, writer/director Cameron Crowe
interviews Tom Cruise, whom Crowe directed in the smash hit ``Jerry
Maguire.'' The magazine is a little overwrought about this, calling
the Q-and-A style piece ``two days of soul-searching interviews.''
If you say so. Cruise searches his soul and reveals that it was
really fun flying those airplanes in ``Top Gun.'' He also says
these words, about the kabillion of dollars he's making, with a
straight face, ``I get paid because I'm worth it and they should
pay me that much. But I've never worked for money, ever.'' The
piece offers a nice bit of retrospective on Cruise's career.
There's also an interesting excerpt from a new book by cyclist
Lance Armstrong, who beat cancer to win the 1999 Tour de France .

 &HT;    INVITING TOURISTS TO BORDER ``HUNTS'' FOR HUMANS IS NOTHING
NEW(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By DANIEL GONZALEZ(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tourists as soldiers of fortune.
</P>
<P>
   That was the gist of an anonymous appeal that surfaced last
month: Fun in the Arizona sun. The great outdoors. The chance to
help ranchers hunt illegal immigrants along the U.S.-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't the first time the idea of hunting humans for
sport has cropped up in Douglas, a border town known for mining,
ranching - and now, illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy years ago, a similar proposal to tourists was pitched in
this same corner of Arizona. But rather than Mexicans, it was
Apache Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the Fimbres Apache Expedition is not only a
reminder of the long-standing racial hostilities along the
Arizona-Mexico border, but it's also a tragic lesson about
vigilantism.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1930 and Douglas, the hub of the nation's copper-smelting
industry, was in an economic slump. The Great Depression was
underway and all the economic indicators pointed downward.
</P>
<P>
   The town's merchants, however, were pioneering people. If
ranching was slow and copper mining on the wane, they would find
some other way to generate money.
</P>
<P>
   And they did. Tourism.
</P>
<P>
   But not just any kind. A.C. Karger, then mayor of Douglas, and
the shrewd chiefs of the local Chamber of Commerce were going to
sell a special brand of tourism, one that capitalized on every
attribute Douglas had to offer: a magnificent railroad station,
excellent rail connections, a world-class hotel, a warm, dry
climate with blue skies and breathtaking scenery.
</P>
<P>
   And the chance to kill Apaches, although that was never overtly
stated in the fliers and newspaper ads promoting the expedition
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The stated purpose of the expedition was the attempted rescue of
a 7-year-old boy who had been kidnapped by a band of Apaches three
years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the underlying message was not lost on the outpouring of
men who wrote letters hoping to join the expedition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never fought Indians, but I have chased Spics all
around Haiti and Nicaragua,'' wrote one adventure-seeker. ``I guess
I'll have the guts to chase these birds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have traveled all over the globe. I have seen a bit of life
and have fought men of all colors, so I would like to become a
member of your expedition, for I love action,'' wrote another.
</P>
<P>
   The Fimbres Apache Expedition stemmed from years of hostilities
between a Mexican rancher named Francisco Fimbres and a band of
Apaches based in the rugged Sierra Madres.
</P>
<P>
   Although warfare between the Indians and the United States
officially ended with Geronimo's surrender on Sept. 6, 1886,
hostilities with his band of Apaches - the Bronco group of the
Chiricahua - continued on both sides of the Mexican border for
another 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   The hostilities exploded into open warfare on Oct. 26, 1926 when
the Apaches ambushed Fimbres and his family. The Apaches killed
Fimbres' wife and kidnapped his son, Geraldo. The Apaches were
seeking revenge for an earlier kidnapping of Geronimo's
great-granddaughter by Fimbres.
</P>
<P>
   The Fimbres Apache Expedition captured nationwide attention, but
in the end the expedition never got off the ground. Officials on
both sides of the border realized the idea of armed gringos roaming
around in Mexico could spell disaster and they quashed the
expedition.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't stop Fimbres. When he learned help from the gringos
was not coming, he reverted to his old tactics. With the help of
vaqueros (Mexican cowboys) and expatriate American mercenaries,
Fimbres hunted down the Apaches himself. A March 13, 1931, photo
captured Fimbres with the scalps of three Apaches.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Fimbres finally found his son in an Apache
camp, hanging from a tree. In revenge for the three Apaches killed
earlier by Fimbres and his men, the Apaches had swung the boy by
his heels and smashed his skull against an oak tree.
</P>
<P>
   Fimbres and his men retaliated yet again, until the last of the
Apaches were hunted down and killed.
</P>
<P>
   The Fimbres Apache Expedition was chronicled in a 1993 book,
``They Never Surrendered: Bronco Apaches of the Sierra Madres,
1890-1935,'' by Texas author Douglas Meed.
</P>
<P>
   Meed sees a parallel between the Fimbres expedition and a
``Neighborhood Ranch Watch'' flier distributed in April that hoped
to convert tourists into soldiers of fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a parallel there, because what you are doing is
asking people to come down and hunt people as sport,'' Meed said.
``The difference is that the ranchers are trying to protect their
land rather than make money off this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Meed also thinks the most recent episode could spark a new round
of violence along the border.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix writer John Alba came across accounts of the Fimbres
Apache Expedition while researching a novel set during the same
period.
</P>
<P>
   He also sees a link between the two calls for vigilantism along
the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a parallel there as to how some Anglo people view
dark-skinned people as less than human,'' Alba said. ``At that
time, in the 1930s, it was the Apaches who were viewed as animals
to be hunted down and exterminated. Now it's common to hear in
various places along the border these expressions that the illegals
are a plague, a vermin, an invasion that has to be stopped.''

<P>
   Angelina Jolie lives on the edge.
</P>
<P>
   Forget planning. Forget the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am always right in the moment,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, the moment dictated that the screen beauty
would dye her hair a color best described as ``grandmother blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, her advisors went berserk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told, `You know, Angelina, people are taking you
seriously now. You've got to take yourself seriously,''' Jolie
says, mimicking the voice of a Hollywood agent.
</P>
<P>
   She sighs and says, ``People are suddenly concerned about my
hair? Please. I was like, `I don't think we fooled anyone.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jolie, 25, delights in making waves. This is a woman who
literally jumped in a swimming pool in her ballgown after winning a
Golden Globe Award for ``Gia'' (1998).
</P>
<P>
   She isn't adorned with jewels but with tattoos, including a
large ``H,'' which stands for Haven, her brother's middle name.
Recently she took a plunge of a different sort and married actor
Billy Bob Thornton.
</P>
<P>
   No one even knew the two actors, who met on the set of 1998's
``Pushing Tin,'' were dating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, when I'm 90, they will never be able to say, `Oh, she was
just another boring starlet,'' Jolie says.
</P>
<P>
   That's an understatement.
</P>
<P>
   Even her clothes are with that Jolie twist. She isn't wearing
DKNY or Ralph Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   ``Try Walmart,'' she jokes, allowing those ridiculously puffy
lips to burst into a smile. ``Hey, it was the only thing that was
clean. I don't have time to go to the cleaners.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, her career is in overdrive.
</P>
<P>
   Jolie stars opposite Nicolas Cage and Delroy Lindo in ``Gone in
60 Seconds,'' opening June 9. It's the story of two rival car thief
gangs who have 24 hours to prove which group can ``collect'' the
most merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do the film because it was high art. It was my summer
vacation last year and frankly I wanted to learn about cars,''
Jolie confesses.
</P>
<P>
   She learned a few practical tips from someone who really knows
his wheels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do know how to steal a car now, although maybe I shouldn't
get that out there,'' she says. ``We actually had a real thief on
the set escorted by his prison guard. I didn't know who they were
the first time. I thought they were two prop guys and then I got
the skinny. I asked the thief a million questions and this guy
could rip apart an entire car and tell you every single part of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Forget logic. Jolie says that after ``The Bone Collector''
(1999) and her Oscar winning turn as mental patient Lisa in ``Girl,
Interrupted'' (1999), she was ready for some screen fun.
</P>
<P>
   But Jolie cautions that she's still a serious actress. In fact,
that's why she turned down one of the leads in the upcoming big
screen version of ``Charlie's Angels.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The `Charlie's Angels' people had a few selling points,''
Jolie says. ``They told me there weren't many good characters for
strong women. But I countered that I've been able to play strong
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was also told that doing `Charlie's Angels' `will make you a
big star,' which is frightening and not a plus in my book,'' Jolie
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at it as a money job. Given the fact that I don't
really like to get dressed up in high heels, it wasn't worth it to
me. I figured that my fun job was `Gone in 60 Seconds.' And
frankly, I thought car thieves and hanging out with the boys was
just so much cooler.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanging out on the A list in Hollywood leaves her cold.
</P>
<P>
   Jolie, who is the daughter of actor Jon Voight and actress
Marcheline Bertrand, says she isn't overly impressed with her
newfound status.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I have the same acting abilities. It's not like I'm
suddenly a better actress because I have awards or this box office
clout,'' she says. ``It's just that now I'm on more covers of
magazines. It's easier to hire me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I don't take my successes personally,'' Jolie says.
``I still think I'm someone who got very lucky. I'm someone who
people took a chance on a few years ago when I was no one in this
town. And now? I don't think I'm so important. I'm just an actress
for hire.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't think that she has a poor self-image.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am secure in the fact that I do have something to offer as
an actress,'' Jolie says. ``I've done justice to my roles. I've
always felt that I was the best person to do the roles that I've
been offered. In fact, I still won't take a role unless I think I
am the best person to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jolie felt that way about her Oscar winning role in ``Girl,
Interrupted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved that movie. I got to fling the windows open and just
breathe and scream. It felt so good. I got to push buttons,'' Jolie
says.
</P>
<P>
   It follows that she loves characters facing internal conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a side of me that understands conflicted emotions,''
Jolie says. ``For instance, when I'm intense, I might be crying but
a whole other side of me is angry that I'm crying. You know, if I'm
soft I hate myself. I don't do self-pity. I want to scream, `I am
not weak!'''
</P>
<P>
   She mentions that being so tough isn't easy either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one of those people who need to learn to let somebody hug
me. I need to learn to need other people,'' Jolie says.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Billy Bob Thornton.
</P>
<P>
   Jolie shocked the world by marrying Thornton. Said Jolie
recently, ``I'm madly in love with this man and will be until the
day I die.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jolie, who's first husband was actor Jonny Lee Miller,
mentioned that marriage frightened her somewhat because of the
split of her own parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``But anything is a possibility,'' Jolie said. ``I know I've
become more stable. I've become more centered. I feel like I've
grown up a lot in the last year.''

 c.2000 Ian Spelling  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though warm as a campfire and always soft-spoken, animator Don
Bluth, the man behind such features as ``The Secret of NIMH''
(1982), ``An American Tail'' (1986), ``All Dogs Go To Heaven''
(1989) and ``Anastasia'' (1998) calls a spade a spade, consequences
be damned.
</P>
<P>
   There's a no-nonsense tone in his voice, an edge that just might
benefit his latest animated epic, ``Titan A.E.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-directed by Bluth and his longtime partner, Gary Goldman,
``Titan, A.E.'' unfolds in 3028, as aliens called the Drej destroy
the Earth, leaving a million survivors stranded in assorted drifter
colonies. One survivor, a cynical 20-year-old name Cale (voice of
Matt Damon), learns that he is genetically coded to be a map that
will lead to the Titan, a ship with the power to create a new
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the earlier films I've done in my career are pretty
much in the area of Disney wannabes,'' Bluth says by telephone from
a screening room in Phoenix, where he's racing to finish the film
in time for its June 16 release. ``They would have a terminal
disease, a terminal disease that I call cute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is very soft and round and cute and harmless.
That's what Disney is. We tried to shift over to an edgier picture
with `Titan A.E.,' one that's not a wannabe. We were hunting for
something that had a little more quills on it, that was more
prickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of digs in the dialogue, a lot of sarcasm.
It's faster paced than most of my films. I don't think people can
look at it and say it's in the Don Bluth style.''
</P>
<P>
   Bluth laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing,'' he adds.
``I have no objectivity about this film. All I know is that it's
very different from anything I've done before.''
</P>
<P>
   Bluth and Goldman weren't supposed to make ``Titan A.E.'' They'd
crafted ``Anastasia'' at Fox's fledgling animation facility in
Arizona, followed that up with a direct-to-video sequel, ``Bartok
the Magnificent'' (2000), and then sat empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Fox president Bill Mechanic then phoned Bluth and Goldman. The
two directors assigned to ``Titan A.E.,'' (then called ``Planet
Ice'') were off the project. Mechanic asked Bluth and Goldman to
pick up the baton, warning that time was of the essence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had fewer months than we'd ever had before, but we said,
`If there's nothing else ready, we don't have much choice, do
we?''' Bluth says. ``So we grabbed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And like any good soldier I surrounded myself with sci-fi
brains who seemed to know all the genre movies that had ever been
made. I said, `Tell me why some sci-fi movies are really, really
exciting, why some of them work so well.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Bluth, his predecessors had sunk $30 million into
artwork and scripting before he ever put ink to acetate. Damon,
Drew Barrymore, Bill Pullman, Nathan Lane and Janeane Garofalo had
already recorded dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Starting over, however, was out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `We're going to take this artwork and reorganize it,
so it's something we can use.' I had a really good art director and
production designer. We shuffled through all of this stuff and
said, `OK, here's what we're going to do.' That seemed to work out
really well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, when I got into the picture, it seemed to me that the
entire focus was on the hardware. I thought, `Who wants to look at
just hardware?' I was reminded that a lot of people do. But a movie
to me is about character, about how personalities come together,
how they relate to each other and what the ramifications of that
are.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went back, crammed in more of the character material,
re-recorded some of the dialogue, and now character drives the
story. We were on this film for many months, and even in the last
week, new lines were being written.''
</P>
<P>
   And now that the film is about to be released, Bluth must face
his greatest nemesis: the Mouse House. As it has for ages, Walt
Disney Pictures will pit one of its own animated features directly
against Bluth's. ``Fantasia 2000'' will open nationwide on the same
day ``Titan A.E.'' hits the screens.
</P>
<P>
   One might think there's enough room in the world for a few
animated success stories. Bluth, however, doubts that Disney feels
that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would often get angry,'' says Bluth, who toiled for Disney
as an animator on such films as ``Robin Hood'' (1973) and ``Pete's
Dragon'' (1978). ``I used to think, `How could they be so
uncharitable?' But business is business. I think that's the way
they look at it, that all is fair in business and they don't mind
who they kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney is the giant. Even though I'm working with Fox, I still
think of myself as the David. Disney has a lot of muscle and I
don't suppose anybody really knows how much muscle they do have.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can block and can do anything they have to do to make
sure they win. And it's all done with a very beautiful veneer, so
no one ever suspects there's anything sinister underneath it.''
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters further, there's more at stake with ``Titan
A.E.'' than meets the eye. It's conceivable that Fox might give up
on animation entirely if ``Titan A.E.'' tanks. Dreamworks, which
will release ``Chicken Run'' this summer, surely can't abide too
many disappointments along the lines of its most recent effort,
``The Road to El Dorado.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anastasia is in the black at this point, but it didn't really
go out there and change the world one bit,'' Bluth says. ``So we
went in for a second one and I believe everyone is saying, `Well,
if this one doesn't work, then what?'
</P>
<P>
   ``In tandem with what we've been doing is Katzenberg (and
Dreamworks). `Prince of Egypt' was going to blow the world away and
it didn't. It's not in the black yet. Right after that they did
`Road to El Dorado.' It was a little disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless somebody steps up, throws a spear and hits the coconut,
I think we're sort of pronouncing our own doom. It's no secret that
Fox has laid off a lot of our staff. A lot. There were 360 (people)
and it's down to 60. So there's a lot at stake.''

EAGLE'S DON HENLEY REVEALS HIS WIFE AND KIDS INSPIRED NEW ALBUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (Includes a color slide of Don Henley.) 
 ATTENTION EDITORS: The following material from The New York Times
Syndicate is for use by STARBEAT clients. Nonsubscribers can use

 By GARY GRAFF  
 c.2000 Gary Graff  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in 1984, Don Henley _ the once and future singer-drummer
for the Eagles _ lamented in song that there was ``Not Enough Love
in the World.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, on his first solo album of all-new material in 11 years,
Henley informs us that ``I'm very, very happy/And I know that's not
what you'd expect from me at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Henley isn't kidding. He's been married since 1995 to Sharon
Summerall, a fellow Texas native. Together they moved from
California to a home outside Dallas, where they're raising three
children. He has found a life's calling outside music in the Walden
Woods Project, an environmental preservation organization. And this
year, he and Eagles partner Glenn Frey are being inducted into the
Songwriter's Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the spirit of bonhomie saturates Henley's new
album, ``Inside Job.'' There are still plenty of pointed social and
political commentaries amid the 13 tracks, but they're balanced by
songs that celebrate the happy state of his home life, including
``Nobody Else in the World But You,'' ``Taking You Home,''
``Everything is Different Now,'' ``My Thanksgiving'' and
``Annabel,'' a lullaby for his oldest daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has certainly had an inspirational effect,'' Henley, 52,
says of his family. ``At the risk of sounding like I've been in
some sort of self-help program _ which I haven't _ I've
rediscovered my better self. I feel in my mind and in my heart like
I did when I was in my early 20s, when I was in college _ and I'm
not drunk or high!''
</P>
<P>
   Henley is quick to add that he's always considered himself an
optimist, and as a songwriter he felt his mission was to point out
that things could be better. But he also acknowledges that the
sweet tenor of ``Inside Job'' will catch off guard those who are
used to the sharp observations of past hits such as ``Dirty
Laundry,'' ``Sunset Grill,'' ``All She Wants to Do is Dance'' and
the Grammy winning ``The End of the Innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has crossed my mind that it might not be very well received
or it might even be ridiculed in some quarters,'' says Henley, who
moved to Los Angeles during 1970 with his band, Shiloh, before
joining Linda Ronstadt's band and subsequently forming the Eagles
in 1971. ``But you know, I don't (care) anymore. This woman and
these children have helped me to rediscover myself, and I don't
mind putting that out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a very liberating thing for me. I've gotten so
much strength and courage from my family that I can afford to be
totally open and honest about how I feel. If people like it, great.
And if they don't, that's great, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Henley has not run out of dragons to slay, however. ``Workin'
It,'' the first single from ``Inside Job,'' offers Henley's take on
the current state of American society. ``They're Not Here, They're
Not Coming'' pokes fun at the the UFO disciples, while ``Damn It,
Rose'' was inspired by a friend's suicide and deals with what
Henley calls ``empty rebellion.''
</P>
<P>
   But where those kinds of songs used to dominate his albums and
seep into his other material, Henley feels they don't burn within
him in quite the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can always go home to the children and to the wife and the
world goes away for a little while,'' Henley says. ``That gives me
the strength and the serenity to live with those things. But, yes,
it has heightened my awareness and, yes, it has made me more angry.
But I think that's balanced because my life is more balanced.''
</P>
<P>
   Henley _ who left his former label, Geffen, to move to Warner
Bros. for ``Inside Job'' _ does have a new battle he's waging. He
and some other artists, including his former backup singer Sheryl
Crow, Billy Joel, Bonnie Raitt and Hole's Courtney Love, have
joined forces to combat the music industry and Congress over what
the musicians feel are actions that are being taken to strip them
of their rights to own their work.
</P>
<P>
   Henley explains that the 1976 Copyright Act provided for the
full return of an artist's work to that artist after 35 years. But
the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), which
represents the record companies, has quietly inserted an amendment
_ tagged on to an unrelated bill _ that re-classified recordings as
work for hire, which allows the labels to own them forever.
</P>
<P>
   This is part of the ``greed fest'' that has followed the recent
spate of entertainment industry mergers, Henley says, and he feels
that ``it's just the first shot across the bow from the record
company. I think they're going to keep on trying to ... cheat
artists out of the rights to their work.''
</P>
<P>
   Henley expects the amendment to be passed into law, and he
expresses frustration at a lack of willingness he's encountering
from other artists to lend their voices to the protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Artists have managed to get organized for all other causes _
for the rain forest, for the environment in general, for
anti-nukes, for cures for cancer, for the homeless, for hunger ...
all manner of charity work we've done,'' Henley says. ``But we've
never been able to get our s--t together for ourselves. And we're
getting reamed in Washington by the record companies, by the
Internet companies, by big business in general. If we're not
careful we're going to sleep through it and have all our rights
taken from us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really want this younger generation of rock 'n' roll artists
(to join the cause). I know they resent a lot of us '70s artists. I
know (Smashing Pumpkins leader) Billy Corgan doesn't think very
highly of people like me. But whether they like me or my generation
or not, there's work to be done in the artistic community, and in
the world community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they all develop a social conscience at some point,''
he adds. ``They probably have one, but there's a lot of ways you
can waste your time thinking you're doing good things. There's a
lot of causes out there, but some are more important than others.''
</P>
<P>
   Any conversation with Henley, of course, winds its way into the
Eagles, the iconic Rock and Roll Hall of Fame group whose 1976
collection ``Their Greatest Hits 1971-1975'' has been the
biggest-selling album in U.S. history. The group dissolved amid
much acrimony during the early '80s but came back together during
1994 for a successful reunion tour that spanned two years.
</P>
<P>
   It also started work on a new studio album last year, but Henley
says a combination of factors conspired to put the Eagles on the
backburner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really at a point in my album where I thought I could
divide my time and my attention and my creativity between my
project and that project, and I found I couldn't do it,'' Henley
says. ``My album had to take priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyway, frankly, I don't think (the Eagles' album) was going
very well. We were definitely headed down the track towards making
a very mediocre record, and I think we needed some distance from
it.''

 `LEXX' EXPLORES SCI-FI's LUSTIER SIDE  
 (Includes a color slide of a scene from ``Lexx.'') 
 ATTENTION EDITORS: The following material from The New York Times
Syndicate is for use by STARBEAT clients. Nonsubscribers can use

 By CHRISTOPHER BLAND  
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 Not to be published in Canada before June 11. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)   &HT;    It has understandably been called ``Star Trek's'' evil twin. In
the sci-fi series ``Lexx,'' there are no final frontiersmen
selflessly rescuing alien kittens from trees. Along the darkly
humorous edge of ``Lexx,'' lust exudes and life is cheap. Against
the greater fabric of television, ``Lexx'' is certainly different.
 &HT;    Even against today's few offerings of relatively exotic sci-fi,
``Lexx'' is a siren of distinction for its black comedy, skewed
take on the human condition and open sexuality _ qualities that act
as counterpoints to contemporary sci-fi sensibilities, according to
Lex Gigeroff, co-writer of the show, along with Jeffrey Hirschfield
(voice of the show's lust-struck robot, 790) and executive producer
Paul Donovan.
 &HT;    Perhaps some of its unique style comes from the fact that the
series is filmed in a remote area of Canada _ Halifax, Nova Scotia.
And the people behind the show are all dedicated to taking a
low-key, unassuming approach to the genre.
 &HT;    ``Science fiction has a tendency sometimes to be very pompous
about itself,'' Gigeroff says, speaking from his office at Salter
Street Films in Halifax, which co-produces ``Lexx'' with Germany's
TiMe Film und TV Produktion.
 &HT;    ``We're really dealing with weighty issues here,'' he adds,
``but there's all sorts of ways of doing that. You can do that in a
heavy-handed way, or in a bit more of an ironic or off-center way,
and I think that's the trick, trying to find the outside edge of
science fiction.''
 &HT;    Gigeroff realizes that ``Lexx'' is not the first show to walk
sci-fi's fringes. ``There were things like `The Prisoner,' which
was certainly dark at times,'' he says of the 1967 series starring
Patrick McGoohan, ``and also things like `Dark Star,' John
Carpenter's dark 1974 space comedy.''
 &HT;    ``Lexx'' debuted in 1996 as four made-for-TV movies called
``Lexx: The Dark Zone Stories'' (now called season one). The movies
came two years after Paul Donovan's 1994 movie ``Paint Cans,''
which featured Gigeroff and Canadian actor Michael McManus, who
plays ``Lexx's'' undead assassin, Kai.
 &HT;    Two years later, in '98, ``Lexx'' returned as a 13-part series,
then returned again this spring with 13 new segments. More than a
Canadian hit, ``Lexx'' is popular in the United States, Britain,
France and Germany. Yet fans exist even farther abroad. Linked to
``Lexx's'' Web site (www.Lexx.com) are a few sites in Russia.
 &HT;    On the simplest level, ``Lexx'' is the story of three space
outcasts _ Kai, Stanley Tweedle (Canadian actor Brian Downey) and
Xev (German actress Xenia Seeburg) _ wandering space in a
cybernetically enhanced insect spacecraft, the ``Lexx.'' Beyond the
familiar backdrop of space, ``it's a show that's not really
connected to Earth in any way,'' says Gigeroff. ``(Kai, Stanley and
Xev) are not colonists from Earth ... So it kind of gives you a lot
of freedom ... a really tremendous latitude to go for it.''
 &HT;    That latitude resulted in a change to this season's story
structure. Where season two was a series of stand-alone episodes,
this year is a narrative centered around an interplanetary war. The
reason is that ``Paul (Donovan) really liked the idea of being able
to take a bit more time with some stories,'' comments Gigeroff.
 &HT;    ``It's sometimes a challenge to create a wholly self-contained
little universe each week,'' he says. ``You can take a bit of time
with some characters, which is what we tried to do with Nigel,''
meaning Nigel Bennett, the Emmy Award-winning Canadian actor cast
as season three's recurring character, Prince.
 &HT;    Another change is Seeburg's costume. Introduced during season
two as a replacement for German actress Eva Haberman, who played
Xev's progenitor, Zev, in the ``Lexx'' movies, Seeburg first
appeared as a savvy, red-haired love slave. The change to Seeburg's
natural blond tresses resulted during production this season.
 &HT;    ``People would see me like I look in real life, even the people
that I worked with, and they would always go, `Oh, Xenia, it's so
good to see you without that horrible red wig,''' says Seeburg from
her home in Dusseldorf, Germany. ``So finally it was like an
all-around agreement,'' which became an on-camera change only after
Seeburg was sure that fans had accepted her as Haberman's
replacement.
 &HT;    A constant of the show has been its stunning digital effects,
created by Filmeffekte GmbH in Germany and CAGE Digital in Halifax.
Yet the effects, too, have evolved. This season was shot using High
Definition technology that was blended with digital imagery, then
treated on video with a film effect. Perhaps the only thing that
hasn't changed is the life-and-death situations in which the
cowardly captain, Stanley Tweedle, routinely finds himself.
 &HT;    ``We really think it's one of our missions in life to put Brian
Downey in as many uncomfortable shooting positions as possible,
just because he's such a great guy,'' Gigeroff says, jokingly.
``Paul and I will be talking about what we're doing, and Brian will
come by and ask, `What are you going to put me in next week?' And
(Brian) does it cheerfully.''
 &HT;    As appealing as ``Lexx'' is to fans, Gigeroff doesn't expect the
show to become universally appealing. ``We've always kind of wanted
to try and get a little cult show,'' he says. ``This is never going
to be a show which everybody is going to like. It was never meant
to be.''
 &HT;    Oddly, some of the stars who've appeared on ``Lexx'' stand as
cult icons in their own right. ``The Dark Zone'' tales themselves
include Malcolm McDowell (an ultraviolent `malchick' in ``A
Clockwork Orange''), Rutger Hauer (tragic antagonist Roy Batty in
``Blade Runner'') and Tim Curry (just a sweet transvestite in ``The
Rocky Horror Picture Show'').
 &HT;    Although ``Lexx'' has had some success, Gigeroff can't speculate
about the future, given the precarious nature of TV. For the
moment, he is content with what he describes as ``an incredible
rocket ride so far'' _ a phrase that perhaps best describes the
impact of the show. As Seeburg says in one of the show's trailers,
it's a ride for you to remember.

   BRITAIN-ALTHORP (Great Brington) _ It is spelled simply enough,
in just two syllables, with no strange or gimmicky combinations of
letters. But for centuries, it has been grievously mispronounced by
everyone who is not anyone. Why would the average person know that
the word Althorp is supposed to be pronounced AWL-trupp? Now Earl

<P>
   NY-CHILD-WELFARE (New York) _ In poorer neighborhoods across New
York City, where the child welfare agency is regarded as a potent,

investigation. That in the nightmare case, a difficult child can

   COLLEGE PARK, Md. _ There is no escaping the conclusion that the
unilateral withdrawal of Israel from southern Lebanon is a victory
for Hezbollah, a group synonymous with terrorism in much of the
West.
</P>
<P>
   Its fighters and methods are being hailed not only in Lebanon
but also in much of the Arab world. For years Hezbollah forces
relentlessly attacked the Israeli army and its allied militias and
avenged Lebanese civilian casualties by shelling Israeli
settlements. A commentator in a Kuwaiti newspaper expressed a
common view, advising Syria to ``borrow Hezbollah for the Golan, or
set up its own.'' He added: ``It will cut the long negotiations
short for them.''
</P>
<P>
   It took a few hundred fighters to force the unconditional
retreat of one of the world's most powerful armies. So, here is a
question on the minds of both frustrated Palestinians and angry
Israelis: Does terrorism pay?
</P>
<P>
   The answer? No, not all. Indeed, the lesson offered by events in
Lebanon may be the opposite: Israel did not succumb to terrorism.
Instead, Israel, despite the power of its army, could no longer
overcome the weakness of its moral position _ occupying someone
else's land.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon has not been the result of the
group's terrorist attacks on Israeli civilian settlements. If this
were the case, it would be strange for Israel to be bringing the
group's fighters closer to its own civilian population by pulling
its forces out of Lebanon. Moreover, no one doubts the ability of
Israel's army, and the will of its people, to defend Israel's own
territories.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawal from Lebanon was the result of military losses
inflicted by Hezbollah fighters on Lebanese soil. The losses became
unbearable not because they were especially large, but because they
seemed pointless to many Israelis. And the occupation of Lebanese
territories made Israel's retaliation seem illegitimate to much of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of moral positions has become a factor in the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. When the Palestinians reacted in 1987
to Israel's continued occupation in the West Bank and Gaza with an
uprising, much of the world sympathized, and many in Israel asked
themselves if they wanted their sons and daughters to suppress
Palestinian children on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   By 1993 the Israeli public's doubt about the morality of
occupation was as much a factor in the country's increased openness
to territorial compromise as actual Israeli losses and
international criticism. In contrast, when Palestinian militants
attacked civilians in the streets of Tel Aviv in 1996, Israelis
didn't give in to their demands; instead, they elected the hawkish
Benjamin Netanyahu as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Prime Minister Ehud Barak appears to be betting that if
he retaliates against any new attack on Israel's own soil, he will
win both domestic and international understanding. The Israeli
public usually has more stomach for losses in the defense of its
own territory.
</P>
<P>
   Although ultimate peace on the Lebanese border will have to
await agreements with Syria and Lebanon, Israel's position is
enhanced by the withdrawal. The real risk of the withdrawal may be
that militants across the Middle East, especially Palestinians,
draw the wrong lessons about the value of violence.
</P>
<P>
   There is a sure way for Yasser Arafat and Ehud Barak to dispel
that idea: quickly reach a fair deal, sending a message that
peaceful negotiations have the greater payoff.
</P>

Maryland, is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.)

 By DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN    
 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Social insurance began in Europe, principally in
Germany in the Bismarck era. In 1911, Winston Churchill carried
unemployment insurance in the House of Commons, representing the
Liberal government. The Tories opposite said the workers would
spend the money on drink; Churchill said it was their money.
Whereupon a first principle was established.
</P>
<P>
   The American Association for Labor Legislation, an academic
group, was established in 1906. Workers' compensation laws began to
appear. Soon, in Albany, Al Smith and Robert F. Wagner brought us
``mothers' pensions'' and the like.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, for the first time we enacted national legislation
providing unemployment insurance, an old-age pension to be known as
Social Security, and a mother's pension, Aid to Families with
Dependent Children. The first two programs were presented as
contributory insurance. I knew Frances Perkins, who was then the
secretary of labor, and have talked with one of the experts
involved, Luther H. Gulick of Columbia University. Both would go on
about Franklin Roosevelt's insistence that each worker have a
separate account, like a bank account. His or hers. As FDR put it
to Gulick, so that ``no damn politician can ever scrap my Social
Security program.'' (Observe that AFDC was not contributory. Soon
it became known as ``welfare,'' and it was repealed in 1996.)
</P>
<P>
   President Eisenhower brought us disability insurance, expanding
workers' compensation. Then came President Johnson with Medicare, a
contributory health insurance plan, and Medicaid, a welfare
measure. A once-a-generation sequence had evolved.
</P>
<P>
   And now we have the opportunity for a grand culmination,
starting this century with a system of voluntary, contributory
savings plans such that Americans will end their working lives with
a measure of wealth. An estate. And for the first time, an American
idea!
</P>
<P>
   A bit of background. In 1977, Social Security, the retirement
program, was changed from a pay-as-you-go system to a partially
funded system. The revered Robert J. Meyers, who was present at the
creation in 1935 and still analyzes Social Security financing,
records, ``The underlying financing mechanism was to build up a
reserve.'' No one noticed this. I was a member of the 1977
House-Senate Conference Committee that enacted the law, and I
surely didn't notice. Nor was it reported.
</P>
<P>
   We added two percentage points to the FICA tax _ Federal
Insurance Contribution Act _ such that today some 80 percent of
American households that pay this tax pay more in Social Security
than in income taxes. In time, larger Social Security surpluses
appeared, enough to moderate the even larger federal budget
deficits of the 1980s, and then to bring us into the overall budget
surplus of today.
</P>
<P>
   Now here is the point. If we will make a few, admittedly
difficult but wholly defensible changes in the existing program,
those two extra percentage points won't be needed. Workers could
take back their half _ the employer keeps the other half _ or could
choose to invest the two percentage points in a personal savings
plan modeled on that available to federal employees since 1987. Let
the magic of compound interest work its magic.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the main changes.
</P>
<P>
   Use an accurate cost-of-living adjustment. The consumer price
index overstates inflation by about eight-tenths of a percentage
point, even after recent improvements made by the Bureau of Labor
Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Next, provide normal taxation of benefits, which are now only
partially taxed. Then extend coverage to all newly hired state and
local workers, a quarter of whom don't pay into Social Security
from their primary earnings but get benefits through part-time
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, increase the number of years counted in computing
benefits from 35 to 38. Of a sudden you are in 75-year actuarial
balance and don't need those two percentage points of payroll
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   On March 18, 1998, Sen. Bob Kerrey and I introduced the Social
Security Solvency Act, with these benefit adjustments and a
provision for a ``voluntary investment of payroll tax cut by
employees.'' In 1999 it became the Social Security Solvency Act of
1999, the first Senate bill introduced in the 106th Congress other
than those reserved for the two leaders. We also included Kerrey's
proposal to provide every child with a nest egg of $3,500: $1,000
at birth and $500 on each of the child's first five birthdays.
</P>
<P>
   With respect, this is where the coming presidential debate
should begin. The numbers add up; they are from the actuaries at
Social Security. There are some tricky details, including a far-off
increase in retirement age. (But note that now most folk, 76
percent, retire before reaching 65, the so-called normal retirement
age.) And of course the main debate will concern the personal
savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   It would be unforgivable to label this ``privatization.'' But it
has already begun. These savings accounts are being referred to in
New York Times reporting as ``partial privatization.''
</P>
<P>
   The term goes back to the presidential campaign of 1964, in
which Barry Goldwater made an offhand remark that Social Security
should be made voluntary. In the definitive study, ``Policy Making
for Social Security'' (Brookings, 1979), Martha Derthick explained
that though the remark was ``not the party's position and not even
clearly the candidate's position,'' it was ``transformed by media
coverage and the ridicule of rival candidates (including other
candidates for the Republican nomination) into a symbol of
Goldwater's radical conservatism.'' As such, she wrote, ``it
figured conspicuously in the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Doris Kearns Goodwin, a distinguished historian of the period,
recently described a Democratic ad of that campaign depicting
scissors cutting a Social Security card in half.
</P>
<P>
   The charge is hurled at every opportunity. Establishing personal
savings accounts is described as turning Social Security over to
Wall Street. Dock workers would become day traders. A market
downturn could wipe out benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The latter charge is obscene. The present progressive retirement
benefit is fixed in our bill. There is no occasion to touch it. We
add a savings plan modeled on the Thrift Savings Plan for federal
employees, including senators. The government matches up to 5
percent of an employee's pay. The money is invested, at the
employee's choice, in one of three plans, ranging from government
bonds to a stock index fund. The employee can switch around from
time to time. If there is an element of risk even in a 40-year
stretch, at no time are basic Social Security benefits at risk.
Those are funded and solid, just as they are today and have been
for 60 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Thrift Savings Plan was essentially an adaption for federal
workers of various retirement plans, principally the 401(k), as it
is known, which were passing the tax committees in the 1970s and
'80s. In the Senate it emerged from the Government Affairs
Committee. Al Gore, then a senator and a member of the committee,
said on July 30, 1985, ``An employee savings plan with government
matching funds will give every worker the opportunity to supplement
a defined and predictable pension amount.'' He praised a
Congressional Research Service report, ``Civil Service Retirement:
Capital Accumulation Plans for Federal Employees.''
</P>
<P>
   A parallel arrangement under Social Security would, at a 7
percent non-inflation-adjusted rate of return, provide an average
worker (making $30,000 a year), with $350,000 of savings at the end
of 45 years. A measure of wealth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1944 the British came up with the slogan of ``cradle to
grave'' protection. We propose something beyond: an estate! For
doormen, as well as those living in the duplexes above.

 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A visit to any courthouse, public hospital emergency
room or welfare office in a large city confirms that our society is
still marred by the social and economic disadvantage of
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, with overt racial discrimination less prevalent nowadays,
many Americans are asking why a concern about social deprivation
should take particular notice of race. This is a fair question.
</P>
<P>
   One answer is that black disadvantage remains a special problem
because it originates from slavery, to which there is this
conservative retort: ``So what? Slavery ended a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   This has prompted a new demand from advocates of
African-American interests: reparations, a money settlement that is
to be given as compensation for past racial injury.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the reparations issue has been around since the end
of slavery, starting with ``40 acres and a mule.'' But lately the
issue has gathered steam. Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., has sponsored
a bill that would establish a commission to study the issue.
Randall Robinson, president of TransAfrica, a lobbying group,
eloquently argues for reparations in his book, ``The Debt: What
America Owes to Blacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Prominent intellectuals, including Charles Ogletree, a professor
at Harvard Law School, and Henry Louis Gates, chairman of Harvard's
Afro-American studies department, were considering a class-action
lawsuit asking for reparations, according to a March article in The
Boston Globe.
</P>
<P>
   Although I am not without sympathy for this position, I believe
that framing the argument in these terms is a mistake. We need some
reckoning with the racist past, but reparations encourage the wrong
kind of reckoning. Winning compensation would, in the end, allow
conservatives to get away with their ``so what?'' retort.
</P>
<P>
   Let me illustrate with a rough analogy. In South Africa, after
the transition to majority rule, a Truth and Reconciliation
Commission was empowered by the new government to pardon those who
had committed political crimes during the long years of apartheid _
as long as the perpetrators of the crimes testified fully and
truthfully to what they had done. Pardons were granted even to
those who had killed blacks for the white regime.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the undisputed truth of what had transpired under
apartheid was established, and it is impossible to revise or
challenge the record. The ``so what?'' retort is easily answered in
South Africa _ now and in future generations.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the United States and South Africa are vastly different.
But the South African case shows why compensation can never be the
foundation for a satisfactory reckoning with the racist American
past. Debts are things that are calculated and (sometimes) paid
off. But the oppression of millions of human beings, orchestrated
and abetted by national and state governments, is an atrocity of an
altogether different order.
</P>
<P>
   The heirs to this atrocity _ long established Americans and
newly naturalized citizens alike _ should be confronted continually
with the horrors of what their country wrought. They should be
challenged to understand the contemporary consequences of these
historic crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The tort-law model underlying reparations advocacy _ he who
causes damage to another is obliged to make the injured party whole
_ is hopelessly insufficient here. It relies heavily upon being
able to demonstrate in quantitative terms the nature and extent of
injury.
</P>
<P>
   How would one even begin to arrive at a sum for the reparation
payments?
</P>
<P>
   Who can say what the out-of-wedlock birth rate for blacks would
be, absent chattel slavery? How does one calculate the cost of
inner-city ghettos, of poor education, of the stigma of perceived
racial inferiority? The severity of slavery's ``injury'' is far
more profound than any cash transfer will be able to reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, reparations would allow the majority of Americans to
look at the situation as one where ``we'' do something for
``them''_ alleviate their suffering, solve their problems, quiet
their protests and then, once the debt is paid off, wash our hands
of society's inequities.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we should follow another model, one that decrees that
``we,'' meaning all Americans, should right the inequity for the
sake of our country. We must attend to this matter so that our
national fellowship and comity will not be emaciated, so that our
moral pronouncements on the world stage will not be made into a
hollow mockery.
</P>
<P>
   As in South Africa, the deepest and most relevant ``reparation''
would entail constructing and inculcating in our citizens an
account of how we have come to be as we are _ one that avoids
putting the responsibility for the current problems of
African-Americans wholly on their shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   The ``so what?'' retort is historically naive and morally
obtuse, but it is very American. So, too, is the clamor for
reparations. After all, we are a problem-solving people who do not
sit easily with the ghosts of our past. But the tragic legacy of
slavery is a problem that simply will not yield to another
application of American ingenuity. It will be with us for some
time.

 By MARY GORDON    
 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has become increasingly difficult to read a newspaper or
magazine without encountering the details of extravagant,
conspicuous consumption, usually on the part of new millionaires,
or billionaires, usually under 30. Stories of $1,000 spent on a
bottle of wine. Reports of a dish of boiled sole and a roasted new
potato that costs $60, not counting, of course, tips and taxes.
Apartments in New York City formerly considered marginally
uninhabitable snapped up at the price of half a million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Our imaginations are drawn to these stories; they have the
allure of soft porn, at least for those of us who congratulate
ourselves on not jumping for the bait, those of us who believe
ourselves capable of the statement, ``It isn't worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   But what do we mean by worth?
</P>
<P>
   When we use the word, we are talking about a system of
equivalencies _ a transaction between the symbolic and the actual
that many people believe is the most real thing there is, but which
is, in fact, a sheer act of imagination. Whose idea was it that a
hard, inedible and unprotecting substance (stones, shells, metal)
could be traded for food, clothing, shelter?
</P>
<P>
   The use of money is the purest act of faith; no anchorite who
has followed a vision into the desert has acted on an idea as
far-fetched as our belief that if we put a dollar in a machine we
will be drinking a Diet Coke in a minute. Of course, we don't think
of this strangeness all the time, but sometimes, when the numbers
seem to have reached the fantastical, we question the idea of
worth: how much should be handed over for what things?
</P>
<P>
   These decisions are often based on personal history or
biography. My mother's sense of worth, for example, was much
different from mine. She had been a young woman during the
Depression and was always haunted by the specter of real poverty,
even during the prosperous 1950s and '60s. She supported us on a
secretary's salary, so we were never able to live luxuriously, but
she suspected all expenditure, almost for its own sake.
</P>
<P>
   She saved wrapping paper and tinfoil and Saran wrap. Closets and
drawers were full of discolored papers and crinkled squares of foil
and ill-smelling plastics. She usually waited for someone to die
before replenishing her wardrobe: wearing the clothes of the dead
seemed to her a superior choice to a purchase in a store. She
deprived herself of the real pleasures of consumption: we never ate
in restaurants or stayed in hotels.
</P>
<P>
   My cousin and I (he was the son of her sister) feel that every
time we buy something that gives us pleasure, we are undoing an old
curse. We refer to such activities as ``mental health purchases.''
</P>
<P>
   The flexibility of a sense of worth was brought home to me last
week when my oldest friend and I sent our children shopping in
Harvard Square. Thirty years ago, we had spent the summer in
Cambridge, she studying physics (she later became a doctor), I
working as a secretary in an insurance company (I later became a
novelist). That summer, we made a weekly decision about whether we
would share a frankfurter at a German restaurant, or a piece of
apple cake.
</P>
<P>
   Half a lifetime later, we dropped our teen-age daughters off,
shoving bills at them through the car window.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much did you give them?'' my friend asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty dollars,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me too,'' she told me.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of us believed we had been extravagant, but we noted the
difference 30 years and increased prosperity had made. Fifty
dollars was liberal, it made us happy that we could offer our
children an ease we hadn't had ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   But what if we had given them $500? Is there ever a point at
which it is important to say, ``this far and no further''? Isn't
there a moment when we question the relationship between what we
paid and what we got?
</P>
<P>
   Was the plate of sole really worth $60? Was the studio apartment
really worth $500,000?
</P>
<P>
   We use the word ``disposable income,'' but shouldn't we consider
what's being disposed of?
</P>
<P>
   Is it only hypocritical or absurd to question what the poor
could do with the money?
</P>
<P>
   The fact that I have to fear that mentioning the poor will
induce only yawns or groans, as if I'd questioned the propriety of
sleeveless dresses, tells us something about what seems important,
even discussable, to us now.
</P>
<P>
   In these times, there seems to be a gap between price tag and
worth. Shouldn't we consider, without fearing that we've turned
into Puritans or killjoys, taking a deep breath before speaking
sentences whose language is made up of numbers that seem
incomprehensibly distant from what once seemed reasonable?
</P>
<P>
   Is this a real question, or just my version or my mother's
shouted admonition: ``Don't rip that wrapping paper off that box so
fast! Do you think I'm made of money?''
</P>

Places'' and ``Joan of Arc.'')

A TYRANNY OF STANDARDIZED TESTS

 By LEON BOTSTEIN    
 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANNANDALE-ON-HUDSON , N.Y. _ The good news about education has
become obvious: the quality of public schools is now on center
stage in national politics. From Al Gore and George W. Bush down to
aspirants for state and local office, all politicians have embraced
the cause of high standards and excellence. The bad news is that
the remedy everyone but teachers and pupils wants to prescribe is
more testing.
</P>
<P>
   The mistrust of schools and teachers has become so widespread
that the only politically viable solution seems to be to impose
more standardized tests. Forty-nine states have now adopted
curriculum standards that explicitly require testing in order to
measure the performance of pupils, teachers, principals, and
superintendents; by 2003, 26 states will have mandatory statewide
tests for high school graduation. As a nation, we now administer at
least 500,000 different kinds of standardized tests a year.
</P>
<P>
   Testing has also become big business. We spend more than $200
million a year on it. The market for standardized tests is growing
faster than that for textbooks. Unfortunately, the two go together
all too neatly; three publishing companies dominate the market for
tests and textbooks alike.
</P>
<P>
   The tyranny of testing has become so intense that teachers may
find themselves spending more than half the year teaching
specifically for tests; their jobs and the standing of their
schools are on the line. Not surprisingly, some teachers in New
York and Maryland have been accused of cheating to improve their
pupils' test scores.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that our mode of testing is primitive and out of
date. We still adhere to the so-called ``objective,''
machine-readable examinations pioneered in the mid-1950s. In the
case of the Regents examination in New York, the questions
themselves are often confusing or deliberately obscure and
sometimes even embody errors.
</P>
<P>
   Who, after all, is writing our English and mathematics tests?
Not our leading writers, scholars and mathematicians. Furthermore,
we still confuse speed with competence. Knowledge and understanding
are not about rapid reflexes; learning is not a sport. Quickness of
recall does not indicate depth of understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do all pupils know the right answer in the same manner or
get the wrong answer or fail to grasp something the same way.
Knowledge and skills are always approximations. A pupil who
confuses World War I with World War II knows something more than
one who mistakes World War I for the American Revolution. Today's
testing instruments do not effectively account for how and what
pupils know.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, they are not designed to measure the rate of change
in each test taker. When we go for a medical checkup, we are
evaluated not only in terms of an objective standard of health but
on the progress or deterioration in our own particular bodies since
the last examination.
</P>
<P>
   The most egregious aspect of our mania for testing is that
pupils never find out what they got wrong and why they got it
wrong. High school students taking the Regents exams in New York do
not get their tests back; neither do the vast majority of millions
of children taking Iowa and Stanford tests or statewide reading
exams. Most often, even the teachers don't get the results back in
time to help them in their teaching.
</P>
<P>
   What is the use of test results that are released months later,
measuring a classroom, a school, a district or a state in terms of
aggregate test scores? Would we tolerate a system in sports where
the calls of umpires and linesmen remained a secret until the next
season and the hits and errors of particular players were never
revealed or justified?
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, studies have shown that weeks after taking the Texas
Assessment of Academic skills test created in the 1990s, pupils
fail to show the apparent mastery of knowledge registered when they
first took the tests.
</P>
<P>
   Testing can and must be linked to learning. A mistake (and right
answers) must be analyzed and corrected immediately for each pupil
individually, just the way we respond when we teach sports and
music. As it stands today, testing is little more than an adult
political obsession that just results in more tests and profits for
test makers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet we now possess the means to change testing fundamentally.
Rapid advances in computers and declining costs make powerful new
technologies, once reserved for government and industry,
accessible: technology involving complex computer simulation, as in
pilot training, and manipulation of data. We can design tests that
are interactive in a way that both helps learning and raises the
standards of education. Even for young children, it would be
possible to throw away the No. 2 pencils and machine-scanned answer
sheets, and have the student tested at the computer itself.
</P>
<P>
   There needs to be an initiative between government and the
software industry to develop a new generation of tests. Programs
can be written that inform the test taker immediately why the
answer was right or wrong and that lead the pupil through the logic
of the question to confirm understanding or correct ignorance.
Politicians and school boards can still get their treasured
measurements of timed test scores; as players are timed in a chess
game, the clock for each test taker can stop and start as the
individual goes through every question, discovering how and why he
or she arrived at answers.
</P>
<P>
   Computers also make it possible to measure the rate of change
for each pupil _ indicating not only the student's progress but the
teacher's effectiveness. Diagnostic tests at the beginning of each
year can be designed that reveal what a pupil can and cannot do or
does and does not know, establishing a baseline. If in the same
classroom one fifth-grader reads only at a second-grade level and
another on an eighth-grade level, a teacher should be evaluated by
what is learned by each of them over the course of a year.
</P>
<P>
   Connecting testing to learning could also free teachers from
forced adherence to bland state-approved textbooks. They would be
given the opportunity to select and choose materials that meet the
needs of each pupil. They would be able to justify the sort of
differentiated, case-by-case decisions for which true professionals
should be trained.
</P>
<P>
   Reforming testing practices to make all this happen, however,
will not be easy. Because software companies and the entrenched
testing and textbook industry respond to short-term profit motives,
public investment will be required for the longer-term work of
adapting computer technologies to a new kind of testing.
</P>
<P>
   Without a radical reform in the way we test, there will be no
improvement in learning and educational standards. We can bridge
the gap between those who are passionate about measuring standards
and those who are ideologically opposed to testing as
discriminatory and unfair.
</P>
<P>
   What our politicians are offering us now is more of the same: a
misguided reliance on a monopoly in a pseudoscience of testing that
defines teaching and depresses learning.

<P>
   Now all you grown-up kids can play Tank Commander while you're
driving home at night: The 2000 Cadillac DeVille sports an optional
night-vision system that detects critters (human or otherwise) in
the dark and projects their images in ghostly form onto the lower
windshield. ``We've brought Desert Storm to the family garage,''
Cadillac executives boast. Did somebody say road warrior?
</P>
<P>
   A host of high-tech gadgets, many based on defense technology,
are finding their way into new cars these days. Besides night
vision, for example, the DeVille has an ultrasonic device that
chimes when you're about to back into something. A slew of luxury
cars are being outfitted with navigation systems, as either
standard equipment or options. Soon cars will have wireless
Internet service and will even read your e-mail aloud to you. (On
second thought, I'll stick with my Eagles Greatest Hits CD
instead.)
</P>
<P>
   General Motors has had enough success with its OnStar in-car
communications system, which combines global positioning with a
pushbutton, cell-phone concierge service, that it's negotiating to
provide OnStar to Toyota and perhaps other car companies as well.
</P>
<P>
   It was the General (military allusion intended) that started the
combat-gear trend. In 1985, GM bought Hughes Aircraft with the
avowed purpose of adapting defense technology to autos. Four years
later, the strategy got its first, modest adaptation: a ``heads-up
display'' system, developed for fighter planes, that projects
information onto the lower windshield. More recently, GM honchos
have declared that cars are really mobile platforms for serving up
a whole host of technological services to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   They may be onto something, but there are a couple of caveats.
First, new technological features will have to be truly useful
instead of just flashy gimmickry. The heads-up display, called
EyeCue and available on the Pontiac Bonneville and some other GM
models, is pretty much the latter. Seemingly aimed at Top Gun
wannabes, it projects your speed, turn signals, headlight beams,
low-fuel indicator and radio station onto the windshield, allowing
you to keep your eyes on the road. I found the turn-signal display
moderately useful, but the rest was distracting.
</P>
<P>
   Caveat two: High-tech gadgetry will be no substitute for getting
a car's fundamentals absolutely right. In short, it's pointless to
consider technological features apart from the car itself. So
here's how a couple of new cars that tout their whiz-bang gizmos
stack up overall.
</P>
<P>
   CADILLAC DEVILLE
</P>
<P>
   When I decided to test-drive the new 2000 DeVille, I was more
interested in the night vision than in the car itself. My age being
well south of 60 _ in fact, slightly south of 50- _ I figured I
would dismiss the Caddy but like the night vision. It ended up sort
of the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   The night-vision system sees through a camera mounted on the
DeVille's front grille. But this camera senses heat, not light. The
resulting images have the ghostly look of a photographic negative,
with hot objects in white and cooler ones in black. These images
are projected onto the lower windshield. You can turn the system
off. And to a degree, you can adjust the location and size of the
projection.
</P>
<P>
   Using the system on a busy road produces a host of bobbing round
images. They are the hot mufflers of the cars ahead of you. It's
mildly distracting. But on dark country roads, night vision may be
worthwhile. Hitting a deer can be dangerous, and the system does
let you spot animals earlier than your headlights do.
</P>
<P>
   The DeVille's other techno-gadget is Ultrasonic Rear Parking
Assist. It sends out ultrasonic waves when you're backing up at
slow speeds and starts chiming when you get within a
yard-and-a-half of an object. It got on my nerves a bit when I was
squeezing into a tight parking space.
</P>
<P>
   If the DeVille's technology proved less than compelling, though,
the car itself was a pleasant surprise. The 2000 DeVille is three
inches shorter and two inches narrower than the previous version.
The styling, while hardly daring, is quite handsome. The DeVille's
ride is comfortable and even a bit cushy, but far from the
``floating sofa'' feel of its predecessor. The steering should be
tighter, even on the DeVille Touring Sedan (DTS), which is designed
to appeal to younger (i.e., 40s to mid-50s) buyers. But the DTS's
standard V-8, 32-valve Northstar engine pumps out 300 horsepower;
it's wonderfully responsive and powerful. All in all, I rather
liked the DeVille.
</P>
<P>
   The DeVille DTS I drove carried a base price of $45,370 with
destination charges. Options, including $1,995 for night vision,
$400 for a security package with Ultrasonic Rear Parking Assist and
$5,520 for other goodies, made the final sticker $53,285. I'd skip
the night vision, haggle and get the price below $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   ACURA 3.2 TL
</P>
<P>
   The best way to evaluate any new piece of electronic automotive
technology is simply to try to use it, without pulling out the
owner's manual. Amazingly, the Acura Navigation System passes this
test with ease. It is remarkably user-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, my wife and I hopped in the Acura to drive from New
Jersey to Brooklyn. We just entered our destination address on the
touch-sensitive screen.
</P>
<P>
   The display is intuitively clear. You can select the most direct
route or specify that the route should avoid freeways, use
freeways, etc. The system shows your location with great accuracy,
and it tells you where to make your next turn and how far it is
until the turning point.
</P>
<P>
   If you miss a turn, it just flashes a message that it's
``recalculating'' and quickly maps the new route.
</P>
<P>
   It still can't see traffic conditions ahead and plot the route
with those in mind. Should that capability be added someday, this
would be a home-run device.
</P>
<P>
   This time, I liked the gadget better than the car. The 3.2 TL
has a smooth, powerful engine (a 3.2-liter, 24-valve V-6 with 22S
peak horsepower) _ the hallmark of all Hondas. The steering is
tight and precise.
</P>
<P>
   But the styling also is a Honda hallmark, which is to say,
nondescript. My major problem with the 3.2 TL, though, is that it's
simply too small. Even a young child won't have much room in back.
</P>
<P>
   The base price is a reasonable $28,855 including destination
charges, and the only option is the navigation system, which costs
$2,000. The electronics are great, but there are other ``near
luxury'' cars with more personality.

 &HT;    Monika Guttman is a contributing editor to ``Child'' and the
mother of two.
 &HT;     &HT;    
 By MONIKA GUTTMAN 
 c.2000 Child Magazine 
<TEXT>
 &UR; World rights &QL;

<P>
   Although their twin boys, Allan and Stephen, are almost 4, Diane
Morancie, 34, of West Orange, N.J., and her husband Craig, 34,
don't roughhouse with them the way some parents do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where most dads fling their children into the air, we just
want to safeguard their existence,'' says Diane. If that sounds
overprotective, she adds, it's nothing compared to when the couple
brought the boys home from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Back then _ haunted by the idea that the babies might die of
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, also known as ``SIDS'' _ they made a
pact: One of them would always stay awake to keep an eye on the two
children. After a few weeks of watching the new parents stumble
around in exhaustion, ``our mothers sat us down and said we had to
stop this,'' Diane recalls. ``They basically told us we had to
trust that the babies would be all right. That wasn't easy for us
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Take normal new-parent anxiety. Add years of effort, expense,
dashed hopes and loss on the road to childbearing. Throw in a dose
of disbelief that the long process is finally over, that the little
bundle in your arms is really yours. What you end up with, say
experts, is a parenting style unique to parents of ``hard-won''
kids _ children who arrive after infertility, multiple miscarriages
or a long adoption process.
</P>
<P>
   The Morancies, who went through six years of infertility and one
unsuccessful in-vitro attempt before having their children, are
part of a growing group of such parents. That's partly because
infertility rates are rising: From 1988 to 1995, the percent of
reproductive-age couples experiencing infertility rose from 8.4
percent to 10.2 percent, or one out of 10 couples.
</P>
<P>
   Adoption, too, is on the rise _ international adoptions by
American parents, for example, more than doubled between 1990 and
1998, according to the Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Couples whose children did not come that easily start parenthood
with a ``special kind of legacy,'' says Ellen Sarasohn Glazer, a
licensed social worker who lives in Boston and the co-author of the
book, ``Experiencing Infertility.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People who've gone through infertility have a stack of
losses,'' she says. ``The losses live on, and even the arrival of a
child doesn't erase the impact.'' The losses may be obvious, such
as a miscarriage, or can include those that aren't socially
recognized, such as a failed in-vitro fertilization.
</P>
<P>
   The most subtle issues, says Dr. Kevin Leman, the Tucson-based
author of ``The New Birth Order Book,'' arise from a
``specialness'' attached to a child born of so much emotion and
endeavor. Leman can relate: When he and his wife had their first
child, who was born after two previous miscarriages, he was
extremely overprotective. ``I turned the heat up in the house so
high you could have raised gardenias in the place,'' he says. ``I
said, 'My daughter is not going to be cold.'''
</P>
<P>
   But after going through emotionally and physically wrenching
procedures, spending incredible amounts of money, or traveling
overseas, parents are so happy the child has finally arrived, Leman
says, that they want to be perfect. That puts enormous pressure on
them, and ``what happens is you create a child who is the center of
the universe,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Such focus goes well beyond normal, Leman maintains, and can
lead to problems. ``When you hand a child everything he wants and
give in to his every need, you end up not with a responsible child
who has developed an age-appropriate independence but a child in
full control of adults.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, there have been some huge strides in recognizing
post-infertility parenting issues, says Dr. Joyce Maguire Pavao,
founder and director of the Boston-based Center For Family
Connections, which provides counseling for parents before and after
adoption. Being aware of some of the following issues before they
occur, she says, can make the parenting of hard-won children less
stressful:
</P>
<P>
   Doubts About Parenting Skills:
</P>
<P>
   Before her successful pregnancy, Linda Carbone, 44, of
Irvington, N.Y., suffered through hormone injections and 10
surgical procedures, including in-vitro fertilization. Her husband,
Ed Decker, 47, underwent an operation to correct misshapen sperm.
For nine years, nothing worked. ``Getting pregnant became a medical
process for me,'' says Carbone. ``I almost lost sight that at the
end of it there was going to be a baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, without assistance, one day she found she was pregnant.
``I didn't believe it was real, and I was halfway through the
pregnancy before I read any books about parenting,'' she says. ``I
think parenting is a lot harder than either of us expected. In some
ways we were not prepared for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Coping With New Parenthood Challenges:
</P>
<P>
   Simply acknowledging that they are tired because the baby was up
all night _ a common complaint for any new parent _ can be harder
for moms and dads who talked only of how much they wanted a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any new mother will tell you that handing the baby to her
husband when he comes home and then going off to the supermarket
feels like a day at the spa,'' says psychotherapist Harriette
Rovner Ferguson, a licensed social worker who lives in Smithtown,
N.Y., and is co-author of ``Experiencing Infertility.'' ``But so
many mothers of much-awaited children say they are full of guilt
for feeling this way. Or if they do complain about parental stress,
their family and friends say, 'But you wanted this baby so much.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson says parents of hard-won babies should know ``it's
really OK to say 'I can't do it all.''' You may find it harder than
others to ask for help and have more difficulty accepting that
you're still good parents if you take a break. It's even more
important to ``ask friends or relatives for help and for both
physical and emotional support, such as finding baby-sitters, ''
advises Ferguson.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing Loss:
</P>
<P>
   Some parents of hard-won babies say they live in genuine fear
that somehow their child will either be taken away or not survive.
``I think it took about a year before I could finally breathe
easily,'' recalls Rebecca Gold, 38, a Los Angeles-based children's
book author who adopted her second daughter, Camila, three years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gold, who 13 years earlier had had her first daughter without
any problems, spent seven years going through infertility
treatments and unsuccessful adoption attempts. ``I remember always
putting my hand on Camila's back to make sure she was breathing. I
would immediately take her to the doctor when she got sick because
I kept thinking it could be something I didn't know about in her
genes.''
</P>
<P>
   Letting go of this fear, says Glazer, begins with accepting the
fact that ``there's nothing crazy or irrational about it. Anyone
who has had a brush with a risky situation has similar fears.''
Acknowledge that, as the parent of a hard-won child, you will
probably go more slowly and cautiously than other parents.
</P>
<P>
   Never Saying No:
</P>
<P>
   Experts say it's easy for these parents to give in to the child
they worked so hard to have. Dodie Hoffman, 38, of Valencia,
Calif., started in-vitro fertility treatments in 1994 and gave
birth to her daughter in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that I was a mom, all I wanted to do was hold her all the
time,'' she recalls. Now that her child is a toddler, ``I noticed
that I'm more tolerant than some of my 'normal' friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially for parents of hard-won kids, the parenting challenge
is drawing the line. Dr. Alix Casler, a pediatrician in Orlando,
Fla., and the host of the Parenting Community at
TheHealthNetwork.com, says, ``if you say yes all the time, then
there's nothing for the child to strive for, and that's not to
their benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   If your knee-jerk reaction is always to concede to your child,
such as buying her a new toy every time she wants one, stop and ask
yourself whether her demand is appropriate before automatically
saying yes. Tying the toy treat to good behavior, such as cleaning
up each night for a week before dinner or helping clear the table
during that same period, will show the child that the toy is a
goal, not a given.
</P>
<P>
   Being Overprotective:
</P>
<P>
   Parents of hard-won kids sometimes try too hard to protect their
children, which arises from the sense that their child is all the
more precious because of the ordeal they went through.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parents do so much for them that the children don't learn
to help themselves,'' says Diane Clark Johnson, director of A
Family Resource, a parent-education center in Oakland, Calif.
``They lose important opportunities for achieving independence.''
This happens, for example, when you hover worriedly or hold your
toddler instead of letting him climb unassisted on jungle gym at
the park.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson suggests ``giving your child more autonomy in small
steps.'' With the jungle gym, for instance, stand next to it rather
than holding on to your child the whole time. Set him up for
success.'' Johnson also suggests doing a reality check with other
parents in your play group or preschool. ``As you look at what
other parents are able to let their children do, and what is
reasonable, gradually try to do it yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the Marriage:
</P>
<P>
   When a much-awaited child arrives, most couples shift their
focus from one another to the baby. But for parents of hard-won
kids, marital stresses can be even more acute. Decker and Carbone
learned this the hard way _ after their daughter Julia arrived,
they only did things as a threesome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been together for 16 years before Julia came along, and
when you've been together for that long, you're really not prepared
for that kind of change,'' says Carbone. ``I feel as if it's very
easy to lose your marriage that first year or two.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember some infertile couples who proudly said, 'We never
leave the children with a baby sitter,''' says Glazer. What they
don't realize, she says, is that years of infertility may have
robbed their marriage of time and romance, and ``they need to tend
to that now. Just as the child is an entity, the marriage is also
one.''
</P>
<P>
   It is critical, she says, to carve out some special time to be
together, whether it's going to the movies or even just dinner,
although it may be harder for these parents.
</P>
<P>
   Leman agrees. While support groups can be useful, he says, new
parents shouldn't worry too much about which ones they should join.
What he believes is even more helpful is ``just to commit to
staying close as a couple.''
 &UR; WHERE TO GO FOR SUPPORT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For most people, say experts, these worrisome issues begin to
die out as parents become confident in their childrearing skills
and begin interacting with other moms and dads in play groups,
preschools, and kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
   Today, especially, there is increasing awareness and
understanding of the important issues these parents face. Chat
groups on the Web are picking up on this topic and churches,
temples and even hospitals are starting to offer classes for
parents of hard-won babies that address many of these topics.
</P>
<P>
   Some useful organizations and Web sites include:
</P>
<P>
   Resolve, the national infertility support organization, has
groups for parents of hard-won kids in some of its local chapters.
For information, log on to www.resolve.org or call the national
headquarters, 617-623-0744.
</P>
<P>
   www.childofmydreams.com has weekly live chats on parenting after
infertility as well as news and basic information on infertility
issues.
</P>
<P>
   www.adoption.com provides support for parents in all stages of
the adoption process. Among their message boards is one called
Adoptive Parent Support Group.

Healthy Living.'' &HT;

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features
<P>
   1. Exercise: Movement is important in controlling varicose
veins. The action of the thigh and calf muscles helps pump blood
upward toward the heart; one-way valves in your leg veins open to
encourage this. If you sit or stand for long periods, however,
these valves weaken and cannot seal properly. Blood then pools in
your veins, stretching them. The bulging results _ visible through
the skin _ are known as varicose veins. Though they generally do
not pose a health problem, they can be unsightly. To prevent them,
take regular stretch-your-legs breaks when you're sedentary, or
elevate your legs after spending the day on your feet. In addition,
Dr. Anne Simons advocates brisk 30- to 60- minute walks daily.
</P>
<P>
   2. Weight control: Though varicose veins can plague women of
varying shapes and sizes, carrying excess weight puts pressure on
the legs, impeding blood flow to the heart and causing veins to
swell. Drop unwanted pounds through a balanced diet-and-exercise
regimen.
</P>
<P>
   3. Herbs: Numerous studies have proven the effectiveness of
horse-chestnut-seed extract in treating varicose veins. A safe dose
for adults is 50 milligrams three times daily in capsule form. This
herb, however, should not be used by children or pregnant or
lactating women.
</P>
<P>
   4. Compression hose: ``Support hose help relieve discomfort by
exerting gentle pressure on the calves, which facilitates proper
functioning of the valves in your veins,'' says Dr. Alan Gaby. If
regular support hose don't do the trick, try thicker elastic
versions available at medical-supply stores.
</P>
<P>
   5. Diet: Feast on blueberries, blackberries, cherries and
bilberries, which are rich in anthocyanosides, a type of flavonoid
that strengthens veins and valves.
</P>
<P>
   6. Homeopathy: ``Healthy Living's'' homeopathy expert, Dana
Ullman, M.P.H., says taking hamamelis (witch hazel) in the 12c
potency three times a day for no longer than a week is a reliable
treatment for varicose veins.
</P>
<P>
   7. Supplements: People with this condition have difficulty
breaking down fibrin, a substance that aids with bloodclotting.
It's deposited in the tissue near varicose veins, making the
surrounding skin hard and lumpy-looking. Bromelain, or pineapple
enzyme, dissipates the fibrin, thus improving the vein's
appearance. Joseph Pizzorno, N.D., recommends taking 500 to 750mg
three times a day between meals.
</P>
<P>
   8. Essential oilS: Massaging rosemary essential oil into the
legs can dilate capillaries near the surface, which may discourage
varicose veins. If you already have them, rub cypress and chamomile
oils into the skin to soothe swelling and relieve pain.
</P>
<P>
   9. Acupuncture: TCM practitioner Efrem Korngold, L.Ac.,
recommends being treated on several acupuncture points, including
Lung 9, on the thumb side of the inner forearm, in the hollow above
the crease of your wrist; and Spleen 6, on the inside of your lower
leg, four finger-widths above the top of your anklebone in the
muscle just behind your shinbone.
</P>
<P>
   10. Ayurveda: Combine equal parts ginger powder, ground black
pepper, coriander, nutmeg and the Indian herbs pippali (or long
pepper) and ajwan (substitute cloves if you can't find this at
Asian markets), says Ayurveda expert David Frawley, O.M.D. Take 1
to 4 grams of this herbal mixture _ which helps rev up circulation
_ three times a day. If you have a kapha constitution (you are
large-framed and deliberate), mix it with honey; if you're pitta
(with a medium build and a type-A personality) or vata (you're thin
and you love change), dissolve it in water.

   Today Americans are barbecuing with a fresh zeal, and along with
the old standbys _ hamburgers and chicken _ are adding adventurous
side dishes. Here are some lively contenders for the coals.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin McCarthy, chef of The Point, a luxurious Adirondack resort
on Upper Saranac Lake in New York, offers a splendid weekly
barbecue. To the traditional fare he adds such fruit and vegetable
accompaniments as table grapes with venison or fish; seared
avocados with hamburgers and sausages; and that tart Italian
chicory, radicchio, with beef or chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Recipes adapted from executive chef Kevin McCarthy, The Point,
Upper Saranac Lake.

frequently until outside grapes have grill marks and a few start to
split, about 20 minutes. Serve hot.

   DEFENSE TECHNOLOGY IN YOUR GARAGE
</P>
<P>
   CARS-TECHNOLOGY-LIFEBEAT _ A host of high-tech gadgets, many
based on defense technology, are finding their way into new cars
these days. Look for night vision, for example, or for an
ultrasonic device that chimes when you're about to back into
something. Many luxury cars are being outfitted with navigation
systems as either standard equipment or options and cars will soon
have wireless Internet service and will even read your e-mail aloud
to you. However, don't be too dazzled. High-tech gadgetry is
fascinating and even fun, but it's no substitute for getting a
car's fundamentals absolutely right. By Paul Ingrassia.

   JAZZ UP YOUR HAMBURGERS WITH SEARED AVOCADOS
</P>
<P>
   SUMMER-BARBECUE-LIFEBEAT _ Today Americans are barbecuing with
fresh zeal, and along with the old standbys _ hamburgers and
chicken _ are adding adventurous side dishes. Just in time for
Memorial Day, the traditional start of summer, here are some
unusual but simple barbecuing ideas from Kevin McCarthy, chef of
The Point, a luxurious Adirondack resort. To the traditional fare
he adds such fruit and vegetable accompaniments as table grapes
with venison or fish; seared avocados with hamburgers and sausages;
and that tart Italian chicory, radicchio, with beef or chicken.

   DOTING PARENTS OF HARD-WON CHILDREN OFTEN CAN'T BEAR TO LET GO
</P>
<P>
   ANXIETY-PARENTING-LIFEBEAT _ Take normal new-parent anxiety. Add
years of effort, expense, dashed hopes and loss on the road to
childbearing. Throw in a dose of disbelief that the long process is
finally over. What you end up with, say experts, is a parenting
style unique to parents of ``hard-won'' kids _ children who arrive
after infertility, multiple miscarriages, or a long adoption
process. Recently, there have been some huge strides in recognizing
such post-infertility parenting issues as anxiety and
overprotectiveness. Being aware of some of the issues before they
occur can make the parenting of hard-won children less stressful.

   TEN WAYS TO BEAT VARICOSE VEINS
</P>
<P>
   HEALTH-VARICOSEVEINS-LIFEBEAT _ Varicose veins aren't
life-threatening, but they can make people very self-conscious.
Normally, thigh and calf muscles help pump blood upward toward the
heart; one-way valves in leg veins open to encourage this. However,
if you sit or stand for long periods, these valves don't seal
properly. Blood then pools in the veins and stretches them. The
bulging results _ visible through the skin _ are known as varicose
veins. Exercise, weight control, certain herbs and the use of
compression hose can improve circulation and diminish varicose
veins. Dietary changes can also help. Blueberries, blackberries,
cherries and bilberries, which are rich in anthocyanosides, a type
of flavonoid, are said to strengthen veins and valves. Other
remedies for the problem include homeopathy, dietary supplements,
acupuncture, Ayurveda and rubdowns with essential oils. By Michael
Castleman.

   LEBANON-PRISON _ BEIRUT, Lebanon _ Until she her release during
the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, Journalism student Cosette
Ibrihim spent 9 months in the notorious Al-Khaim prison, run by
Israel's allies, the South Lebanon Army. She said that as a
Christian and the objects of an international human rights cause,
she received ``lenient treatment'' a month of interrogations and
beatings, no trials or lawyers. ``Here,'' here captors told her,
``You defend yourself.'' Lebanese are debating whether to turn the
hill top prison into a museum or turn it into a prison for
collaborators. Inmates there in the '80s describe days chained to
electrical posts, sessions of dowsings with extremely hot or
extremely cold water. While her country celebrates Israel's
withdrawal, Ibrihim is suffering from stress, aggravated ulcers and
exhaustion. She's bitter and unsure of what to do with her life.

   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ The closest I ever came to
knowing the joy of living in a small town, before I moved to this
one, was the neighborhood I grew up in. It was neither a suburb nor
a planned community. It was a tree-lined street of modest homes and
an endless variety of folks living on it. At the corner we had
Bader's Pharmacy, a bakery, a small grocery store, and Hodap's
Butcher Shop _ not because of some municipal visionary's blueprint,
but because they were needed. (Schuett, Cox News Service). MOVED

lessons in seventh grade, defied her mother and got a two-piece

 &HT;    Lab tests supplements' content
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Though the world of natural supplements is confusing
and frequently contentious, it is home to a few advocates who are
consistently reliable, responsible and clear. One of the most
notable is Mark Blumenthal, founder and director of the American
Botanical Council, an independent nonprofit group, and editor of
the peer-reviewed journal HerbalGram.
</P>
<P>
   Now Blumenthal has lent his expertise to a new Web enterprise,
and it looks like a winner. Consumer Lab (www.consumerlab.com) is
conducting privately financed tests of vitamins, herbs and other
nutritional supplements to determine whether the content of the
products matches industry standards and the manufacturers' label
claims. Brands that hold up under scrutiny are listed on the site
and receive the right to display the trademarked CL seal.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the site has reviewed various brands of gingko biloba,
vitamin C, the antidepressant SAMe, the osteoarthritis supplements
glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, and the prostate support herb
saw palmetto. The findings are provocative: Significant numbers of
the supplements lacked key components or did not contain the
advertised percentages of active ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Chief personnel for Consumer Lab are William Obermeyer, formerly
a high-ranking natural products chemist with the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, and Dr. Tod Cooperman, founder of a group that
rated consumer satisfaction with managed care companies.

 &HT;    Cure for paralysis closer
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The cure for paralysis from a spinal injury is
closer than ever, but that only means there's no longer a consensus
that it's impossible. Not only is it too soon to predict when
people will walk on formerly paralyzed legs, it's still impossible
to predict how medical science will make that happen, say
researchers for the prominent Miami Project to Cure Paralysis at
the University of Miami, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``The optimistic view is that we're looking in years or decades
rather than centuries,'' said anatomy professor Robert Fyffe, who
directs the biomedical sciences Ph.D. program in the School of
Medicine at Wright State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still trying to find out how all the different parts
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Fyffe's WSU program is one of the leaders in drawing that map
and user's guide for the central nervous system. It is providing
sophisticated imaging data to construct the first large-scale
computer model of spinal cord cells with thousands of functioning
synaptic connections, through which motor signals pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``The connections are mind-boggling,'' Fyffe said, with a single
motor nerve cell receiving 20,000 to 50,000 signals in order to
control just a few fibers in a single muscle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's these thousands of connections that are lost when there's
a spinal injury,'' Fyffe said. ``So we're trying to figure out how
things are working at the single cell level. What are the important
aspects of the connections? How are these systems organized? How
are things altered when there is an injury?''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the basic research at WSU and other centers, research
focuses on enhancing the lives of the 250,000 paralyzed Americans
with spinal cord injuries and on what the Miami Project calls the
five steps to a cure, according to W. Dalton Dietrich, the
project's scientific director.
</P>
<P>
   They are identifying which injuries are most responsive to
treatment, limiting the early damage from an injury, regenerating
nerve growth, enabling regenerated nerves to pierce the body's
fortress protecting the central nervous system and rehabilitating
control over newly mobile limbs.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical spinal injury, Fyffe said it is the axons of the
neurons that are damaged. The axons extend as far as several inches
away from a neuron's cell body, passing down the spinal cord to
stimulate the nerves that control the muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can protect these cells from dying off because their
axons have been damaged,'' Fyffe said, ``and then facilitate the
ability of the axon to regrow past the injury site, that's really
what regeneration or recovery of function in spinal cord injuries
is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   The neurons on both sides of the injury still work, he said.
``What they're losing is all the inputs. So if only we could get
the connections back, we could get them working under voluntary
control again.''
</P>
<P>
   Interest in spinal cord research was rekindled locally last week
with the news that Dayton police officer Mary Beall was paralyzed
below the waist after she was shot in the neck May 15. Considerable
progress has been made even in the 13 months since activist-actor
Christopher Reeve merged his foundation with the American Paralysis
Association to form the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   _ London researchers were able to regrow and reconnect nerve
fibers in the damaged spinal cords of laboratory rats with the help
of neurotrophin proteins.
</P>
<P>
   Neurotrophins are growth factors that help the central nervous
system develop, Fyffe said. They already had shown promise in
limiting what's called secondary damage, which spreads from the
site of a spinal injury in the hours following the injury.
</P>
<P>
   _ By injecting paralyzed rats with embryonic stem cells,
researchers at Washington University in St. Louis restored movement
to their legs nine days after their spines were injured. Stem cells
are the undeveloped cells that have not yet committed themselves as
specialized parts of, say, lung tissue, heel bone or arm muscle,
but their use is controversial because they come from human embryos
after abortions or miscarriages.
</P>
<P>
   _ A surgically implanted electrical device, with a computer chip
in the abdomen wired to 15 electrodes on nerves and muscles in the
legs, helped a paralyzed Belgian man walk with special crutches in
March. Although scientists cautioned the device was effective only
for certain types of paralysis and only for short distances, it was
seen as an early step to artificially replicating motor signals
from the brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it'll take a combination of therapies,'' Fyffe said.
``I don't think there will be a day when someone stands up and
says, 'We've got the cure now.' ``

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service AUSTIN, Texas _
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Can you please provide a mailing address for Erin Brockovich?
</P>
<P>
   _ G.A.L. A: Catch a glimpse of the real Erin in her cameo movie
role as a waitress? Erin Brockovich persuaded attorney Ed Masry to
employ her for $800 a month after hiring him to represent her after
an automobile accident. Brockovich still works with Masry. Send
missives to Masry &AMP; Vititoe, attention Kathy Brown, 5707 Corsa
Ave., 2nd floor, Westlake Village, Calif. 91362. Q: Is there a
difference between a tornado watch and a tornado warning? My boss
thinks they are the same.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rick Y.
</P>
<P>
   A: Time to enlighten the boss. A tornado watch means the
possibility of storms turning into a tornado exists. These
favorable conditions may be hard to believe, says KXAN's
meteorologist Jim Spencer, since when you hear the watch you may be
looking at a nice blue sky. A warning means action is required
since severe weather, such as a tornado, is imminent. In the case
of a warning, a tornado has been sighted on radar and may in fact
be on the ground. Time to seek shelter. How to remember which is
more serious? Warning (more imminent) has more letters than watch.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there a nonprofit organization called Jupiter Index that
supposedly helps people with literacy, mainly writing and
composition? A group was doing door-to-door solicitations claiming
the above. Questions concerning their goals were answered vaguely.
If this is a scam, the public needs to be warned, as their story
sounds plausible. Was I correct in not giving a donation?
</P>
<P>
   _ Martha R.
</P>
<P>
   A: When in doubt, demur. The Better Business Bureau maintains a
file of information on charities and is developing a Web site with
the data (e.g., percentage of raised funds going to programs or
administration). Jupiter Index has not filed any information with
the BBB. While charities are not required to file information, they
are encouraged to do so, says BBB President John Etchieson. Next
time you are approached by the group, ask for printed material and
contact information.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for the bonnet-style hair dryer, Dazey brand if
possible. Who sells them?
</P>
<P>
   _ A.T.
</P>
<P>
   A: Dazey Soft Bonnet Hair Dryers are available on the Web at
www.earthcommerce.com ($36.80 plus S &AMP; H).
</P>
<P>
   Q: It's already starting! Last summer, my trash can turned into
the fly factory. It was impossible to keep flies from laying eggs
(maggots, yuck!) by the hundreds, thousands, in my trash. I cannot
keep the trash inside. I have scrubbed the can with bleach, tried
spraying it (daily) with a flying-insect bug spray, had my pest
control treat the area around it with pesticide and used kitty
litter/baking soda on the bottom of the can. How do I keep my trash
can from being the local fly pick-up bar?
</P>
<P>
   _ J.C.
</P>
<P>
   A: What's a nice tse-tse like you doing in a can like this? It
may not be you; it may be your neighbors, notes Jimmie Roach, chief
sanitarian at the Texas Department of Health. Check the can lid. If
the can has a tight fitting lid and is kept clean, the problem
could be nearby open areas. Are you close to a farm, ranch or
poultry operation? Are your neighbors as conscientious as you are
about bagging refuse and keeping containers clean? Is the
neighborhood rife with large dogs creating a manure problem? Roach
advises checking within a one- to two-mile radius.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I want to see where I can get a copy of the film that was
shown at the Washington Press Club dinner (I think) of Clinton in
``The Final Days.'' I saw part of it on the ``Today'' show, but
it's so funny, I'd like to have a copy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Amy Brees
</P>
<P>
   A: The White House Correspondents Dinner has become a highlight
of political entertainment. C-SPAN is hawking this political video,
currently priced at $24.95 (plus shipping and tax). President
Clinton's tongue-in cheek presentation wooed the usually cynical
crowd with vignettes of what life at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is
like for a president looking at retirement (delivering his wife's
brown-bag lunch, etc.). To order, call (877)662-7726 or visit
www.c-spanstore.com. The cast of NBC's ``The West Wing'' also did a
spoof at the correspondents' dinner, which is not available for
purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I cannot afford to use air-conditioning. When it gets humid,
I drown my body in talcum powder to sleep. I even sprinkle it on my
sheets and pillows. Will the powder absorb oil, not just
perspiration on my skin? I am afraid of doing something that would
make me more wrinkled. And will the talc on my pillow, if I inhale
some, harm me?
</P>
<P>
   _ B. Evans
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, the talcum powder will absorb oil and, no, it is not a
good idea. Dermatologist Steven Zimmet warns the powder could lead
to overdrying of your skin. If untreated, the dry skin contributes
to wrinkling and could develop into a skin disease such as xerotic
eczema. In addition, Dr. Zimmet warns there may be a link between
talcum powder use and ovarian cancer. Cornstarch powder may be a
better selection for perspiration control. Inhaling it? Excessive
amounts could cause respiratory problems, reports Doug Borys of the
Central Texas Poison Control Center. Problems have been reported
with chronic use of powder, although using small amounts is fine.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have recently acquired a collection of antique knives, some
as much as 100 years old. Some show age marks and discoloring. What
can I do to keep them from deteriorating more? At first I put a
light coat of oil on each after they were handled, but I've since
been warned that the oil will seal in moisture and make things
worse. Short of putting them in a vacuum, what is best?
</P>
<P>
   _ Ron Brown
</P>
<P>
   A: Veteran custom knife maker Scott Costa (830-693-3431) says it
is difficult to know what is best for your knives without seeing
them. However, most older knives are high carbon steel that need
some protection to retard tarnishing. His suggestion? Put the oil
away, and pick up a silicon-impregnated gun rag, which coats a
blade with a protective film. Always wipe blade after handling.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm a recent convert to Diet Mountain Dew from Diet Coke, and
was told that the ``Dew'' has twice the caffeine. Is this true? Is
that why I'm typing this e-mail so quickly?
</P>
<P>
   _ C.S.
</P>
<P>
   A: Not twice, but a whole lot more. Diet Coke (12 oz.) contains
46 milligrams of caffeine; Mountain Dew, 55. Caffeine is a bitter
white alkaloid and a mild stimulant. Dew is a lemon-lime beverage
of unusual color concocted by soft drink salesman Bill Jones in
Marion, Va., in 1961. It is the preferred beverage on long-distance
drives. Q: Do you know where I can purchase a ZIP code directory?
</P>
<P>
   _Belinda Sandoval
</P>
<P>
   A: ZIP is ``an acronym for Zone Improvement Plan.'' ZIP codes
for specific addresses can be obtained online at www.usps.com.
Directories are available in hard copy ($31.50) at local post
offices or from the National Customer Support Center, United States
Postal Service, 6060 Primacy Parkway, Suite 201, Memphis, Tenn.
38188-0001. Obtain order forms from your local post office and
include payment. Shipment will take up to four weeks. Q: I observed
The New York Times is published in Texas, but the format is
practically identical to that published in New York. How does this
come about?
</P>
<P>
   _ Paul G.
</P>
<P>
   A: The New York Times is printed in 12 locations around the
country. The information is electronically transmitted via
satellite to these locations. The Times' own fleet of trucks
distributes the papers to each region.

 &HT;    Medical advances at the bottom of the mug
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ I do not take my health news full
strength. I take it with the milk and sugar of wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   I am selective. I ignore the salubrious medicinal effects of
Brussels sprouts, squid brain and exotic teas made of powdered
pumpkin seeds, orange rinds and just a touch of power-steering
fluid. I concentrate instead on the health-giving qualities of red
wine, select food preservatives and the orange powder on cheese
curls.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Journal of the American Medical Association
released a study that was just my kind of scientific research. The
kind that justifies habits I already have. The kind that quiets
criticism from the opinionated and conspicuously healthy.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that coffee-drinking prevents Parkinson's
disease. Or at least that people who drink buckets of coffee are
less prone to the disease. This is not precisely the same thing but
close enough for me.
</P>
<P>
   The study of 8,000 Japanese-American men in Hawaii found
coffee-abstainers were five times more likely to develop
Parkinson's disease than people who drank four-and-half to
five-and-half cups a day. A lot of coffee, but the scientists were
counting dinky little six-ounce servings as a cup. Not a healthy
10-ounce cup of Joe.
</P>
<P>
   Abstainers were two to three times more likely to be afflicted
by Parkinson's than those who merely drank one or two dinky cups.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers believe caffeine is the key to this. That means
highly caffeinated sodas and other health foods could have the same
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Parkinson's disease involves deterioration of nerve cells that
produce a chemical the body needs to control muscle movements.
That's why head and hand tremors are associated with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   How does coffee and caffeine work to inhibit this? Nobody knows.
</P>
<P>
   It may be something in the way caffeine works to stimulate the
nervous system. Or the way it works on the brain stem. It may even
be that the kind of people with nervous systems that demand coffee
have other things working in their body chemistry that fight off
Parkinson's. Can't tell.
</P>
<P>
   The article ends, unsurprisingly, with a plea for more research.
</P>
<P>
   What's surprising is not that a chemical that prevents serious
disease can be found in so pleasant a substance.
</P>
<P>
   Nature should work that way. Coffee feels as though it is doing
something good when it works its magic on your morning neural
chemistry. Why should we assume our bodies lie to us?
</P>
<P>
   What is strange is that after 600 years of drinking the stuff,
people are only now finding this out.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes right down to it, we really don't know that much
about a lot of our intake.
</P>
<P>
   Consider what would happen if coffee were only being introduced
now.
</P>
<P>
   How would you feel going to a Food and Drug Administration panel
and explaining that your company has just developed a liquid that
somehow works to quicken mental processes?
</P>
<P>
   No, you don't know quite how it works. No, you don't know its
side effects. Further, the effects you have documented differ
wildly from person to person.
</P>
<P>
   No, you are proposing distributing it without prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   And no, there would be no recommended dose. Actually, people
will never know how concentrated any cup of the substance is until
they sip it.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it is addictive. The withdrawal effects _ including a
headache that can feel like aliens hatching from the front of your
brain _ are short-lived and not life-threatening. And not to worry:
we will develop a massive distribution system that will ensure that
no American would ever be more than 1,000 yards from the product.
</P>
<P>
   No, it didn't seem to hurt the lab rats. It merely made them run
around in quick little circles.
</P>
<P>
   No, we do not plan on warning labels. Besides, we wouldn't know
exactly what to warn folks about.
</P>
<P>
   This would not be a very strong presentation.
</P>
<P>
   The regulatory panel would need to get back to you. Approval
might have to go through a few more hoops.
</P>
<P>
   More research is called for. And I, for one, am willing to
redouble my efforts.

 &HT;    This is not your mother's microwave
 &HT;    By Shaun Conlin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If ``computerized oven'' sounds like an oxymoron
or something out of ``Star Trek,'' take a look at The FlashBake 120
($1,700, www.flashbake. com), an oven as revolutionary as the
microwave, which seemed so very sci-fi just a few decades ago. The
stand-alone or wall-mounted unit utilizes a high-energy halogen
light controlled by a microprocessor. The oven is pre-programmed to
apply energy at different times during the cooking cycle to
penetrate and cook from any or all angles, depending on the food
and cooking mode chosen. The technology involved can bake, broil,
steam, grill, roast and even saute. Cooking with light as opposed
to microwaves or raw heat provides maximum flexibility and
versatility _ and there's no preheating required. ``Cooking with
light is the wave of the future,'' said Henry Colleti, president of
Vulcan-Hart, a supplier of commercial FlashBake ovens, which have
been in use since 1993. ``We're excited that this advanced
commercial cooking technology is now available to the chef at
home.''

 &HT;    Quick View offers virus protection
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   Using one of the free services, I want to set up a Web site for
my civic organization from which just the 25 members might access
information, such as bylaws, meeting notices, minutes, etc. Who
offers these services?
</P>
<P>
   _ Cheryl Smith, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Sounds like what you need to do is set up an intranet. It's
a bit different from the Internet, which is a huge, global computer
network. An intranet is a space on the Web where a group can easily
access and share documents, calendars and information. Intranets
are usually password-protected, which gives your group control over
who has access to its information.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Give Intranets.com (intranets.com) and MSN.com
Communities (msn.com) a look-see. These intranet sites are FREE!
They'll help you every step of the way: From setting your site up
and designing it, to hosting and support.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Intranets.com is mostly geared toward small businesses, but
it could work for your organization too. They provide 25 megabytes
of space on their servers, you'll exist in their domain
(groupname(at)intranets.com), and you'll have control over who
visits your site. They offer scheduling, messaging, discussion,
document management, contact directory, instant messaging, news and
finance information. You can save files for others to download,
have a real-time conference with members of your group and use
e-mail to keep everyone in the loop on events.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: MSN Communities works like Intranets.com, except it is
geared more toward clubs, organizations, personal sites, photo
sites, family and communities. You'll exist in its domain, and each
member can have up to 30 megabytes of space. That's a good bit more
than Intranets.com. What's cool about MSN is that you can subscribe
to public community sites and see what everyone else is up to. But,
if you need privacy, you can create a private site. The public will
not be able to access your information. Access is by invitation
only.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Another way people are coming together is through community
Web sites. AtHomeNet.com, an Atlanta-based company, touts its
intranets for communities, associations and subdivisions. There is
no set-up or design fee. They do charge a monthly fee, depending on
the number of members.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: The idea is to improve and promote communication within
residential communities. You pretty much get the same features
we've described. The difference with AtHomeNet is that you can
purchase your own domain name. You can decide the exact name of
your intranet. For instance, if you live in a subdivision called
Cambridge Park, you could name your intranet cambridgepark.com.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Community intranets can display their own advertisements
ranging from home sales to finding a baby sitter. Ads can be
designated as public or private. We thought this was a great
feature.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd write for The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution. E-mail questions to techsavvy(at)ajc.com.

 &HT;    Lord, he's _ a Pibber?
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Youthful rebellion takes many forms. My first
coming-of-age rebellion was to hide in the ditch when the piano
teacher came. It was the beginning of the end of lessons I
detested.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, who didn't want to take swimming lessons in seventh
grade, defied her mother and got a two-piece suit to protest.
</P>
<P>
   My oldest son chose rebellion of a fashion as a middle-schooler.
He dyed his sandy hair auburn.
</P>
<P>
   None of this guaranteed, we told ourselves, that our youngest
son, now in the autumn of age 12, would ever fall to said
condition. Sure, he would disobey on occasion and act like a kid.
But he would never make some sort of kooky symbolic statement that
tossed convention out into the slop, or denounced his heritage. Not
him.
</P>
<P>
   Then a few days ago he made the most jarring announcement ever
made in an ever-tranquil home.
</P>
<P>
   ``No Dr Pepper. Mr. Pibb.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Pibb? This cannot be so. My son and Dr Pepper have been
linked almost since birth, sharing the same birthplace: Waco. On
steamy summer days, they were more than 10, 2 and 4. They were
every half hour.
</P>
<P>
   As one who loved Dr Pepper long before wings of fate delivered
me to its holy land, my heir's love affair touched me. Now his new
dalliance pains me.
</P>
<P>
   Before he could bite off ``c's'' and ``t's'' he was requesting
Dopper Pepper. Waco being the nation's per-capita Dr Pepper
consumption capital, he was contributing to the cause almost before
he consented to solid food.
</P>
<P>
   TWO ONE-SODA GUYS
</P>
<P>
   Just like his dad, my son, whose initials are RC, would never be
caught with any but DP. It was there for him in good times and bad,
for richer or poorer, for pizza party or Amoxycillin.
</P>
<P>
   And then what happened in his sixth-grade year but a flirtatious
vending machine at school that caught his eye. It had no DP. Based
on a handsome promotional contract, Waco schools vend Coke products
exclusively.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it was at school that he tried this Dr Imposter. At first I
know it was in protest (I'd seen him turn up his nose at Mr Pibb in
restaurants). Then it came with less resistance. Then he was under
its spell.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who loves Dr Pepper is wise to the crafty attempts of
competitors in the industry to copycat the formula Charles Alderton
whipped up at the Old Corner Drug.
</P>
<P>
   FIZZY FORGERIES
</P>
<P>
   The Dr Pepper Museum has an occasional display on these efforts,
showing all the Dr Fauxes and Dr Fakes. Attempts at matching the Dr
Pepper formula were made way before the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to present, the first mass-consumed effort was the late,
not-great Dr. Wells. Museum director Joe Cavanaugh blames Dr. Wells
for a misimpression Dr Pepper still must deal with. There's no
prune juice in Dr Pepper. None. But the imitator had it.
</P>
<P>
   Mr Pibb was Coke's venture into the field of Pepper imposters, a
field which continues to grow as super stores and grocery chains
introduce their own attempts. Cavanaugh estimates that the world
has 20 to 30 attempts at it.
</P>
<P>
   And now my son has been seduced by one of them. When I sent him
away to school I figured all sorts of influences might change him.
He'd probably find girls, and interests to which I'd not exposed
him. He'd probably find new foods on the cafeteria that appealed to
him. But I never imagined that his schooling would lead him into
the arms of another soda.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I should refuse to play along. Maybe I should ignore his
request for the 2-liter Pibb at the store. The indignity of it all.
To think that some of my hard-earned cash is underwriting rank
fakery of a national treasure, here in Pepper heartland.
</P>
<P>
   I'll do it. The next time he requests Mr Pibb from me, I'll show
him. I will hide in a ditch.

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   As a revamp of a bona fide classic, Excitebike 64 ($60;
www.nintendo.com; for Nintendo 64) faithfully pays tribute to its
heritage while bringing the simple side-scrolling dirt bike game up
to speed with the 3-D gaming era. Not to be confused with a
sophisticated motocross simulation, Excitebike 64 is all about
mud-mucking motocross mayhem while suspending disbelief. A great
selection of decently animated bikes and riders, each with specific
strength and weakness, race around more than 20 handsomely designed
indoor and outdoor tracks. As with the original, the excitable
bikes come equipped with a finite amount of ``turbo,'' which will
overheat and stall a motor if overused, making for some
strategically selected high-speed overthrusting. Aside from
farcical lateral control during ``Whaaahooo!'' airtime, Excitebike
does have a fairly accurate physics model that offers enough
realism within its larger-than-life premise to make it the best
``arcade'' dirt bike racer to be found on the N64.
</P>
<P>
   Are you the kind of acquisitive, collective person who proudly
displays ``complete sets?'' Do you scour every inch of game levels
seeking ``secrets?'' Do you count the cracks in the sidewalk and
make certain that at the end of each walk equal numbers of cracks
have been crossed with right and left feet? Do you think you're
clever? In short, Alundra 2 ($40; www.activision.com; for Sony
Playstation) takes obsessive-compulsive disorders, burns them onto
a Playstation disc, then spins them round and magnifies them to a
power of two. It's intricate and ornery, a puzzle-ridden
action/adventure role-playing game of ludicrous proportions.
There's no artificial intelligence to be seen as everything is
pattern based, but the sheer exploratory extremis gameplay should
keep any gamer into these sorts of games happy for a long, long,
long while.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   Thief II: The Metal Age ($40, www. eidosinteractive.com; for
Windows PCs) tiptoes the same path as its predecessor, adding a
handful of new features but, for the most part, succeeding as an
expansion rather than a true sequel. The original first-person
sneaker, ``Thief: The Dark Project'' was the surprise breakthrough
hit of 1998, a thinking-person's shooter emphasizing stealth,
timing and cold calculation over brute force. As master thief
Garrett, you creep through the night, hiding in the shadows,
awaiting the proper moment to pick a pocket, dash into an alcove
or, if you must, strike a blow. The game's graphic engine hasn't
been updated, the enemies still tend to be blocky-looking and not
too bright, and there's no multiplayer game. Yet the sinister,
gloomy experience as a whole remains immersive, tense and fun.
Thief II offers new weapons, great voice acting and 3-D sound
effects, challenging new enemies, a variety of missions, plus 16
large, interesting and beautiful levels. It remains an innovative
concept and the new installment is a solid successor to the
groundbreaking original, worth many hours lurking in the shadows
and scurrying across the rooftops.

 &HT;    Growth of online grocery services says something about our
society
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The city of Atlanta is under siege. Invading armies of
vans and trucks are everywhere, driving up and down our streets,
stopping at any house that will let them in, bribing our children
with Pokemon cards and us with fresh produce and free delivery.
Like they say on ``Star Trek,'' ``Resistance is futile.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it is the invasion of the online grocery stores. WebVan
(www.webvan.com) has already marched through town and HomeGrocer
(www.homegrocer.com) will follow on June 14. The addition of
HomeGrocer will make Atlanta one of the few two-online grocery
towns in America. (Three, if you count online convenience store
Kozmo.com.) We only have one newspaper but a variety of online
delivery services. We can get stamps, Starbucks, Krispy Kremes and
cola delivered right to our homes with a click of a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Take that, New York.
</P>
<P>
   Surely Atlanta's wealth of online delivery services says
something about the changing world we live in. It probably says
something deep and profound about the increasing impact of the
Internet on daily lives. It also probably speaks volumes about the
increasing number of ordinary people using the Internet to
accomplish the routine tasks of everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly I think it says people are tired of lugging cases of
soda and 10-pound bags of cat box litter out of the grocery store,
into their cars and then into their homes. Why spend your precious
spare time waiting in milelong checkout lines and then dragging
groceries around in those paper-thin plastic bags, when some
pleasant grocery courier will happily do it for you, refuse to take
tips and charm the kids with pockets full of goodies.
</P>
<P>
   You can't swing a cat in metro Atlanta without seeing a WebVan
truck on its way to or from some household that's probably giddy
with excitement that the grocery guys are coming.
</P>
<P>
   Our grandmothers used to have groceries delivered, too, but it
was never front-page news. But remember, for a generation that
lives with do-it-yourself checkout lines, automatic bank tellers
and self-service gas stations, ordering groceries online and having
them brought to your door whenever you want and deposited exactly
where you want seems downright revolutionary. Online grocery
shoppers are more than eager to tell you about their adventures.
</P>
<P>
   They do it with a mix of awe and wonder that makes old-fashioned
grocery shoppers want to log on and order a loaf of bread, some
peanut butter, three oranges and a box of cornflakes _ even if they
don't need any.
</P>
<P>
   The folks at WebVan and HomeGrocer both say a little competition
in the online grocery business is a good thing for everybody. They
claim it will help people to think of alternative ways to shop for
groceries. WebVan spokesman Bud Greeby says just because we've been
shopping at the supermarket for decades doesn't mean it's the best
way to shop for groceries. He could be right and he could be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Our fascination with online grocery shopping could be a fad that
will fade once the novelty of it all wears off. Or it could be a
huge hit with time-crunched families who still have to pick up dry
cleaning they dropped off three months ago, never mind find time to
get to the market.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, even the most computer-phobic people in town are
putting WebVan through its paces. Business is so brisk, the company
has literally run out of trucks and is using plain old unmarked
trucks to make deliveries. This is not to say that WebVan is
problem-free.
</P>
<P>
   Delivery areas are determined by ZIP code, and residents in
several suburbs both north and south of the city report heated
online and offline debates with WebVan representatives insisting
they do live where they say they live. While the selection is
extensive, you get every last box of cereal or flavor of ice cream.
And as addicted as we may become to online grocery shopping, there
will always be those double coupon days at the local market when
boneless chicken breasts are on sale for 99 cents a pound.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes online shopping doesn't make sense, and stopping off
for a bottle of milk on the way home actually is easier than online
ordering. But of course, 20-pound bags of dog food are another
story altogether as any pet owner will tell you.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of a WebVan truck or a UPS delivery man hopping out
of his truck with a pile of boxes that have the Amazon.com logo
stamped all over it speaks volumes for how wired a city and its
residents are. Those trucks mean that somebody inside the houses
they're headed for has computers or access to a computer and is
using them to make purchases to save time, to save money or just
because they think it's fun.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need a Harris Poll or a batch of Internet pundits to
tell you the Internet is everywhere. Just keep an eye out for those
online delivery trucks.

 &HT;    Virtual dressing room
 &HT;    By Mary Jo DiLonardo
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I just tried on a gazillion swimsuits without leaving
my home or removing a stitch of clothing. There were no fluorescent
lights, no tattletale three-way mirrors and no snide saleswomen
saying, ``You are going to try on that?''
</P>
<P>
   It's every woman's clothing dream and it's available courtesy of
the Internet. Now, there's finally a really good reason for owning
a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual dressing rooms are just beginning to make their way onto
the Web. With them, you can try on clothes on a virtual body that
looks like yours. Then you can buy what you see without ever having
to go to a mall.
</P>
<P>
   It's incredibly cool.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest name in the business right now is Land's End where
you start out by creating ``your personal model.'' You can use the
quick way or the detailed questionnaire to create an online version
of you.
</P>
<P>
   With the quick version, you enter a few general specifications
like waist (well-defined? not so well-defined?), shoulders (broad?
narrow?), hair color, hairstyle and the shape of your face.
</P>
<P>
   With the detailed version you have to dig out a tape measure,
supplying precise measurements (to the 1/8 of an inch) about
everything from your bust and your height to your hips and your
waist.
</P>
<P>
   Next you give your virtual self a name (I chose Monique), hit
the Frankenstein-ish ``build my model'' button and within moments a
replica of you is on your screen. Then you start trying on stuff.
</P>
<P>
   I (I mean Monique) was trying on things I'd never think about
toting into a dressing room. How did I know I wouldn't look good in
a tankini if I didn't try one on, after all?
</P>
<P>
   You choose the item and the color and watch what your virtual
image looks like in the clothes you pick. You can spin your model
around to look at yourself in profile or from the rear. There are
added benefits like recommended outfits and style advice tailored
to your appearance and measurements (or at least what you said were
your measurements).
</P>
<P>
   I immediately became a huge fan because ``Monique'' was offered
such gushing advice as, ``You can add variety to your wardrobe
because you look good in everything.'' Obviously wrong but
incredibly good for the ego.
</P>
<P>
   While Land's End is the only major clothing retailer with a
virtual ``you'' for trying on virtual clothes, some companies are
experimenting with other cyberhelp.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently at Eddie Bauer's online site, there was a virtual
dressing room that allowed you to put garments together to see how
they look. You visualized an outfit to make sure that top really
went with those pants before you pulled out your charge card. (This
virtual dressing room is currently being tinkered with but is
expected to be back online _ new and improved _ by late summer.)
</P>
<P>
   A New York-based company is trying to take this virtual dressing
room a much bigger step forward.
</P>
<P>
   At yourfit.com, you will create a virtual you where you'll be
able to try on clothes from various online retailers. You visit an
online store, then click a button to try on the items in your
shopping cart. You are then whisked away to youfit.com where you
enter your measurements (or refer to the measurements you already
have on file) and a virtual you gets to try on before you buy.
</P>
<P>
   Company founder Steve Ross spent years in the catalog industry,
where he said at least a third of all returns were because clothes
didn't fit right.
</P>
<P>
   When you first visit the site, you enter general measurements
that you'll probably know off the top of your head (height, weight,
waist, etc.). You'll then be given a choice of three images that
meet those measurements. You pick the one that looks most like you
and you're off.
</P>
<P>
   Then, once you register, you'll receive a tape measure in the
mail along with detailed instructions on how to take various body
measurements. You can go back to your virtual image and keep adding
measurements, making the model look more and more like you.
</P>
<P>
   Yourfit.com will debut in early August on various online
retailer sites. The company is currently negotiating with major
names like J. Crew and LL Bean, says Ross. The immediate plans are
for only a female model since women do 60 percent of all e-commerce
apparel buying, says Ross. The company hopes to release a male
version early next year. (Though you can't really experience
yourfit.com yet, you can visit the Web site for a pretty cool
sample demonstration.)
</P>
<P>
   A San Diego company, e.fitting, plans on introducing similar
products.
</P>
<P>
   Later this month, it will debut Fitting Wizard where you enter
your measurements to find out what size you should wear at various
retailers. A size 6 at Old Navy might be an 8 at Gap.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in June, e.fitting introduces Mirror Please, where you
scan in a photo of yourself, then see a two-dimensional ``you''
trying on clothes from different online retailers. (Do those pants
from J Crew really go with that shirt from Eddie Bauer?)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, later this year, e.fitting plans on releasing
Bodybuilder, a 3-D body model that lets you try on clothes from all
over the Web. All three products will be available as free
downloadable software at the company's Web site, www.e-fitting.com.
</P>
<P>
   But clothes aren't the only thing you can customize online.
</P>
<P>
   There's even a virtual makeup counter to save trips to a
cosmetics department. At Reflect.com, you can have beauty products
custom-created just for you by entering your beauty vital
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   It's kind of a lengthy process with layers upon layers of
questions about everything from the clothes you like to wear to the
color of your eyes. Some queries were simple: Ethnic background,
hair color. Others were a little more thought-provoking like the
Barbara Walters-esque ``If I were a house, I would be?'' (I
struggled between a maintenance-free condo and a ranch in the
country.)
</P>
<P>
   Once you've checked all the boxes, you can jump to hair care,
cosmetics or skin care to find individual products. The items are
mixed up especially for you _ with catchy names like BR255 _ then
shipped to your door. During the process you even get to choose the
design on the package.
</P>
<P>
   I opted for squiggles. I think they'll go best with my tankini.

 &HT;    Web now the best place to get shareware, freeware
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Most of us have sampled e-commerce by now, and the
idea of buying something online is no longer strange or
frightening.
</P>
<P>
   But long before there were dot-coms offering items for sale, the
Internet _ and computer Bulletin Board Systems before that _ had
strange little storefronts where the merchandise was free for the
taking.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, shareware and freeware programs were mostly
found on CompuServe, Prodigy and AOL. That was before these
services became gateways to the Internet. Whether you were looking
for a game or a word processor or a spreadsheet program, it was
pretty easy to find a free or inexpensive one to download and use.
</P>
<P>
   That's still true. It's just that now, the Web is the best place
to find these programs. We'll look at some of the places where
they're available today. But before we start that, you need to
understand the two terms: shareware and freeware. The two types of
programs have a lot in common.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, instead of being sold in stores, they're mostly
distributed online. That means that people who can't afford to
start a company and sell commercial software can create programs
and distribute them with no marketing or manufacturing costs.
</P>
<P>
   Shareware is a type of program that you use on a free trial
basis. After using it, if you like it, you're supposed to send a
payment. If you don't like it, you simply delete the program and no
money is owed. Freeware is as you'd figure, software that is
distributed with no payment owed. You'll find both types of
programs on the sites we visit today.
</P>
<P>
   Our first stop is www.shareware.com. It's one of the best places
to start. Simply use the opening page just as you would a
conventional search engine such as Yahoo. Fill in the search terms
that describe the program you seek. You'll also need to use the
pull-down menu to tell the search engine the type of operating
system you are using: Windows, Macintosh, Linux, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've filled in all the blanks, the page will search out
software that seems to fit your criteria. Once you find a program
that you want to try, double click on it, and it'll download
automatically to your computer's hard disk. Almost all these
programs are made so that they'll extract and install automatically
_ again you just need to double click on the file you downloaded.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, you'll need programs that are used to extract the
files for you. If that's the case, you'll be told about how to
download of copy of that extraction program.
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds unwieldy and complicated, read the help sections
you'll find on all these pages. You'll get instructions on how
things work in much more detail than can be offered here.
</P>
<P>
   Now that you know how these sites work _ and all of them work in
an almost identical way _ we can cover ground faster.
</P>
<P>
   The next site to check is Tucows and is at www.tucows.com. This
is a site that specializes in the kind of programs you need to use
the Internet efficiently. You'll find the obvious here: browsers,
newsgroup readers, e-mail programs, FTP (file transfer protocol
programs, used to send and receive files over the Internet) and
tiny utility programs that can tune up your online connection to
make it more efficient. There are also some very specialized
Internet programs here, things that most of us don't need.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best things about this particular site is that _ when
you log on to it _ you are able to select a computer server in your
own area from a list. That means that the downloads generally will
go faster and that there isn't the sort of online congestion you'd
find if one server was trying to handle the load.
</P>
<P>
   Other sites for downloads include, but aren't limited to,
download.cnet.com/, www.softseek.com/ and www
</P>
<P>
   .planetclick.com/cgi-bin/category
</P>
<P>
   .cgi?T &QC; download+software.

 &HT;    Folding bike is a convenient traveling companion
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Riding a bicycle is one of the most
energy-efficient ways to get around, but using a bike to travel is
sometimes impractical.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the route is too long or too steep or perhaps you don't
have a secure place to stash your bike.
</P>
<P>
   The Montague Corp.'s line of folding bicycles may help you get
around some of those obstacles. Montague says its bikes are
full-size vehicles that fold down to half their size in less than a
minute without the use of tools. The bikes fold down small enough
that they can be carried onto public transportation such as buses
and commuter trains. Montague makes a fabric bag with a shoulder
strap to make it easier to carry the bikes.
</P>
<P>
   The company also makes a rigid suitcase that can be used to pack
the bikes for the luggage compartments of airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Some Montague bike users ride to work and then fold them for
storage under a desk for the day. They also fold small enough for
storage in a small closet.
</P>
<P>
   To fold a Montague bike, the rider loosens a quick release bolt
to remove the front wheel. Two quick-release bolts on the seat post
are then loosened, and the rear wheel swings around to fold over
the middle of the bike frame.
</P>
<P>
   The Montague CX 21-speed Comfort Bike, one of the company's
newest models, comes with either an 18- or 20-inch aluminum frame
and sells for $449.99. It weighs 30 pounds and folds to 36 inches
by 28 inches by 12 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Other models include a mountain bike, an off-road bike, an urban
bike, an electric bike and a tandem bike, all of which fold for
easy storage.
</P>
<P>
   For more information or to place an order, call (800) 736-5348.

 &HT;    Illustrators gather to promote positive images of
African-Americans
 &HT;    By Rachel Kipp
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIRBORN, Ohio _ The pictures in a simple children's book speak
a thousand words to Willis ``Bing'' Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a visiting professor in the African and African-American
Studies program at Wright State University, sees the images of
African-American people and culture in children's books as part of
the key to how children perceive themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Self-esteem is partly sourced by how the society views and
portrays them,'' Davis said. ``By putting forth positive images,
images that look realistic and show people in positive way can help
influence positive image and self-concept.''
</P>
<P>
   As he prepares to finish his year-long stay at WSU, Davis is
giving the public a change to get to know the life and art of three
book illustrators who are promoting realistic images of
African-Americans. ``Reading Images: African-American Fine Artists
as Illustrators'' is the theme of symposium Thursday at the WSU
Student Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole concept came as a result of wanting to share the
creative efforts of a couple of African-American artists working in
an arena where they sell and paint and work the gallery scene but
also do work illustrating books as a means of trying to get out to
the general public more positive images of African-Americans and
the African-American experience, while at the same time encouraging
more involvement in reading,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   The participants are Tom Feelings, an artist and retired
professor from Columbia, S.C.; Jon Onye Lockard, a professor at the
University of Michigan, and Dayton native Tyrone Geter, who also
lives in Columbia, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   The three illustrators will create a sequence of
African-American history through children's books. Feelings book,
``The Middle Passage,'' represents 20 years of research into the
persecution of Africans captured and transported under horrible
conditions to be sold as slaves in the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to tell a very adult subject matter using the form
of a children's book but expanding it by using elements from black
culture,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The illustrators will progress from facts to folklore starting
with Lockard's for ``Ebony Sea,'' written by Irene Smalls-Heltor.
In the book, a man recounts the legend of a group of slaves
transported by way of the Middle Passage who choose to follow a
woman back into the sea rather than become slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said ``Irene and the Big Fine Nickel,'' also written by
Smalls-Heltor completes the cycle by telling the story of an
African-American girl living in Harlem in the 1930s and '40s.
</P>
<P>
   Geter said he thinks the works he did for Irene are some of his
best.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every book I've ever done I've tried to make (the
illustrations) say something positive about black people and people
in general,'' Geter said. ``(Irene) is about a time when Harlem was
actually safe. When people sat on stoops and actually communicated
with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said each illustrator has worked to create positive
images.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping to be able to gather a variety of things,'' Davis
said. ``No. 1 to interact and applaud highly skilled and highly
recognized African-American visual artists; No. 2 to get an insight
into the function and role of illustrations in books that will
depict people in a positive light; and the third would be that (the
audience) will recognize the contribution artists can make to the
positive development of all young people both inside the culture
and outside the culture.''

 &HT;    Nothing but the truth of contrite reviewer
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Comes now the plaintiff, J.G. Warner, who makes these
representations to this honorable court:
</P>
<P>
   1. Plaintiff states that on or about April 5, 2000,
representatives of Plantronics, a California firm, sent him one of
the company's Model CT10 cordless headset telephones to use in the
hope he would review it in his newspaper column.
</P>
<P>
   2. After using the Model CT10, and carefully studying the user's
manual (Exhibit A) included with it, plaintiff did write a review
of the CT10 which was published on or about May 14.
</P>
<P>
   3. While using the Model CT10, plaintiff noted that if the
telephone box was clipped to the user's belt as instructed, the
telephone's keypad was upside down. Before mentioning this in his
review, he again carefully perused the manual (Exhibit A) for some
explanation. Finding none, plaintiff mentioned this in his review
(Exhibit B), writing that the keypad was upside down for ``reasons
that escape me.''
</P>
<P>
   4. On May 16, plaintiff received an electronic communication
(Exhibit C) from a reader who stated: ``The phone clips upside down
so that when you look down to dial, it appears right side up.''
</P>
<P>
   5. Plaintiff was made to feel slow-witted and stupid, and his
reputation as a wide-awake newspaper columnist was severely
tarnished, as a result of his failure to note this fact in his
review of the Model CT10. Plaintiff submits that Plantronics is the
proximate cause of his emotional and professional agony, because it
failed to explain its purpose for the upside-down dialpad in the
instruction manual (Exhibit A).
</P>
<P>
   6. Defendant will no doubt suggest that had Plaintiff clipped
the box to his belt, he would have needed no explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Such a defense would be meritless, however, since Plaintiff is
one of a large class of potential users of the Model CT10 unable to
see their belts due to overlapping anatomical projections.
</P>
<P>
   7. Plaintiff states his mortification is so great that no amount
of monetary damages could allay it. Instead, he prays this
honorable court will punish defendant, so as to deter any future
attempts to embarrass reviewers of its products, by making its
executives spend an hour a day for one week dialing 900 numbers on
their CT10s while taking tango lessons.

 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Imagine calling your favorite automobile mechanic and
first explaining that your Toyota is making a ``plunka plunka''
sound as it climbs hills. Then you ask him to diagnose and fix the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   What do you think would happen? Most likely he would ask you to
bring the car in. A lot of different problems can result in that
same sound. Even if he has a good guess about what the problem is,
he'd probably need to actually open the hood to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   But it's natural to think that _ with computers _ there is some
magical incantation that can be said over the phone, or some file
that can be deleted, to fix any problem. It just isn't so.
Computers aren't just gadgets made up of hardware, they're a
magical mix of hardware and software. And since each computer has
different components, different programs installed too, what would
fix one computer might not help on another.
</P>
<P>
   So, unless you're a computer guru, you need to face the reality
that _ when something goes wrong _ you need to be able to either
find and fix the problem yourself or bring it in to an RE (real
expert) to get it fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it will help to learn a little about how you can diagnose
a problem. So today we'll open the hood a little and take a peek
inside.
</P>
<P>
   First, you need to know that most computer problems are caused
by the most recent change you made. If your computer was working
perfectly yesterday and stops working today, it's smart to think
about any changes you've made. So, at the first sign of trouble,
look back and try to find what you've changed and consider that
last change to be the main suspect for your problems. (Obviously
there are exceptions. Sometimes hard disks fail, components burn
out but start by assuming that your problem comes from software or
a new device.)
</P>
<P>
   If you're lucky enough to remember a change that you've made,
then try undoing that change. For instance, if you've just
installed new memory, take it out and return the computer to the
way it was before and see if it works. Or if you've hooked up a new
modem, take it out and replace it with the old one. If you've added
software, uninstall it (using the uninstall feature that you'll
find on the Control Panel in Windows) and see if that returns
things to normal.
</P>
<P>
   Never make two changes at the same time. For instance, if you
realize that you've recently installed a modem, added some software
and also changed the way you log on to the Internet, don't reverse
all those changes at one time. If you do and the problem goes away,
you won't know which of the many changes caused the problem in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   Next, if things are still wanky, go through what may seem like a
silly exercise. Take my word, it's not silly at all. Start
searching for the obvious. Make sure that all the cables, including
the power cable, are plugged in tightly. I remember getting a call
from someone here at the newspaper about a modem that didn't work.
I spent 20 minutes checking all sorts of complicated things before
I noticed that the telephone line to the modem had become
unplugged. I fixed the modem by plugging it back in. So don't
ignore the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't solve the problem, consider opening up the
computer _ only if you feel comfortable doing so _ and reseating
all accessory cards (video card, sound card, etc.). Sometimes the
heat inside the computer can cause metal to expand and a poorly
seated card can get loose enough to cause intermittent problems.
</P>
<P>
   Also remember to go to the Web sites for the programs you run.
Look for technical hints there. You may find a note from another
user, or from the company itself, that explains a glitch that could
be causing your problem.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, don't be afraid to get professional help. I know that a
lot of your friends are computer geniuses. You know it too because
they've told you that. Some of them are, no doubt about it. But
some aren't. Unless you are really sure of your friend's skills, go
ahead and spend the money to get professional help.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen a lot of computers that were fixed so well that they
needed major surgery.

 &HT;    Can you write well?
 &HT;    By Keith Still
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Nine-year-old Nicholas Le can, and his penmanship has
earned him more than respect from his teacher and classmates. It
impressed handwriting experts so much that they named Nicholas the
national handwriting champ for third-graders.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas was one of about 100,500 kids who submitted a
handwriting sample to the National Handwriting Contest sponsored by
Zaner-Bloser. The company publishes handwriting books that teach
children the proper way to form letters. Entries came from 47
states, the U.S. Virgin Islands and the Department of Defense
School in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put 218 percent of my effort into handwriting,'' said
Nicholas, who attends St. John the Evangelist Catholic School in
Hapeville, Ga. ``I've been doing cursive since the first grade. I
practice a lot at home and at school _ but mostly at school.''
</P>
<P>
   As National Grade Level Champion, Nicholas won an engraved pen,
an award plaque and a $500 U.S. savings bond. Though his friends at
school have asked him to split the bond with them, Nicholas said he
plans to use the money for college.
</P>
<P>
   To enter the contest, students in grades 1 through 6 wrote two
short sentences. First- and second-graders wrote in manuscript,
although some second-graders chose to submit a cursive entry.
Third- through sixth-graders wrote only in cursive. A panel of
Zaner-Bloser handwriting judges reviewed each entry and selected
state champions. Then Zaner-Bloser's master penman, Clinton
Hackney, chose national champions for each grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The students' handwriting was judged on legibility,'' said
Georganna Harvey at Zaner-Bloser. ``The judges looked at the shape
of each letter, the slant, the size and the spacing between the
letters and between the words.''
</P>
<P>
   Zaner-Bloser began holding the contest nine years ago to
emphasize the importance of good penmanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Handwriting is a vital skill that students will use for a
lifetime,'' Harvey said. ``Despite high-tech communication devices,
every business still depends upon pen and paper.''
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't the first year Nicholas entered the handwriting
contest, and it doesn't appear to be his last either. He's eligible
for three more years, and he's already practicing for the
fourth-grade competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to win again next year,'' he said.

 &HT;    U.S. warming up to China
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The United States last week took the first step toward
becoming better friends with China. The U.S. House of
Representatives voted to grant China permanent ``normal trade
relations.''
</P>
<P>
   If the bill becomes a law, China will have full access to sell
its products to Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Senate will vote on the bill in June.
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate agrees, the U.S. Congress no longer will vote each
year on China's trading status.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 20 years, Congress has decided once a year whether
China has behaved well enough to be granted the privilege of
trading with America.
</P>
<P>
   The United States watches closely how well China treats its
citizens. Part of the bill requires a group to monitor China's
actions. China protested that section of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ETHIOPIA WIN IS ERITREA LOSS
</P>
<P>
   The people of Ethiopia celebrated a major victory over the
country of Eritrea last week. The Ethiopian military broke through
Eritrea's central front, taking back the town of Zalembessa.
</P>
<P>
   The two countries on the Horn of Africa have fought for two
years over land along their 620-mile shared border. Eritrea
declared independence from Ethiopia in 1993. In 1998, Eritrea
claimed more land along the border.
</P>
<P>
   After losing Zalembessa, Eritrea's government declared it would
withdraw from the disputed land. Eritrea said it was leaving
voluntarily, but Ethiopia said Eritrea was forced
</P>
<P>
   to retreat.
</P>
<P>
   SPEARS' `OOPS!' SETS RECORD
</P>
<P>
   Forget Madonna, Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston. Britney Spears
has beaten them all.
</P>
<P>
   The teen pop star set a one-week sales record for a female
artist with her second album, ``Oops! . . . I Did It Again.'' In
its first week, it sold 1.3 million copies,
</P>
<P>
   according to Soundscan.
</P>
<P>
   Spears' ``Oops!'' is the second-fastest-selling album ever. 'N
Snyc's ``No Strings Attached'' sold 2.4 million copies in its first
week earlier this spring. The Backstreet Boys'
</P>
<P>
   ``Millennium'' holds the third spot. It sold 1.1 million copies
in its opening week.
</P>
<P>
   All three artists _ Spears, 'N Sync and the Backstreet Boys _
are on the Jive Records label.

 &HT;    Fixed-rate mortgage interest drops after recent increases
 &HT;    By Susan Harte
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the first time this month, long-term, fixed-rate
mortgage interest rates stopped climbing.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates on the 30-year and 15-year loans in metro Atlanta
dropped an average three basis points each this week from last
week. The 30-year mortgage averaged 8.30 percent, down from 8.33
percent; the 15-year loan averaged 7.99 percent, down from 8.02
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the one-year, adjustable-rate loan was again up, at 7.14
percent, vs. last week's 7.03 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite rates more than a percentage point higher than this time
last year, the Atlanta housing market continues to be strong, said
Pat Flood, president of HomeBanc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home buying is far more linked to employment than to interest
rates. Look at 1994, when rates were down at 7 percent. We did not
have a real active housing market because we were just coming out
of a recession and people were afraid to buy, even with low rates,
because they still felt their jobs might go. Right now, employment
in Atlanta could hardly be better.''
</P>
<P>
   Bank Rate Monitor, which tracks mortgage rates, reported that
the 30-year loan carried an average of 0.76 discount points, while
the 15-year mortgage had 0.73 points. The ARM had 0.23 points. A
point, 1 percent of the loan amount, is a fee lenders charge at
closing.
</P>
<P>
   FRAUD PLAN DESIGNED TO PROTECT HOMEOWNERS
</P>
<P>
   Tale after tale of predatory lending has documented how home
buyers have been lured into taking loans they cannot afford on
houses not worth the money.
</P>
<P>
   One of many agencies now interested in the problem is the
Department of Housing and Urban Development. It has come up with a
Fraud Protection Plan designed to shield the unwary from predatory
lenders. The plan, which resulted from forums held in several
cities this year, aims to protect families that get new mortgages
insured by the Federal Housing Authority, a HUD agency.
</P>
<P>
   The problem largely has been caused by good news, the booming
housing market that characterizes many U.S. cities, observed HUD
spokesman Lee Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Predatory lending has gotten so big so quickly and so
explosively that we have to move very fast to get ahead of it,''
Jones said Thursday. ``Especially in hot markets like Atlanta, a
lot of people want to buy,'' and a lot of banks want to help them _
even unscrupulous ones.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jones, HUD already has regulatory authority to
impose sanctions on dishonest lenders and home appraisers, and it
will ask Congress to pass laws to cover the entire market, not just
FHA-insured homes.
</P>
<P>
   Elements of the plan, which will be funded from the FHA's
general budget, include:
</P>
<P>
   _ If a mortgage is based on a fraudulent appraisal, the FHA can
force the lender to rewrite it, based on true market value.
</P>
<P>
   _ Homeowners in danger of foreclosure will have access to free
counseling.
</P>
<P>
   _ The FHA will cap fees to prevent lenders from charging
unreasonably high points and closing costs.
</P>
<P>
   _ If a homeowner goes into default because of a predatory loan,
the FHA can make the lender issue a ``credit repair letter.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The FHA would refuse to insure flipped properties, or those
bought out of foreclosure and then resold at an inflated price.

FORMER INDONESIAN PRESIDENT SUHARTO UNDER HOUSE ARREST 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Under intense public pressure to get tough,
the Indonesian government placed former President Suharto under
house arrest Monday as it sought to bring him to trial for
corruption and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto, 78, has been debilitated by three strokes and is
apparently able to communicate _ sometimes incoherently _ only in
his native Javanese language. He has managed, with the help of his
lawyers, to complicate repeated attempts by investigators to
question him in his home.
</P>
<P>
   The house arrest, which does not materially change Suharto's
living conditions, was instituted ``to smooth the investigation and
in order to finish the case as scheduled,'' said Yushar Yahya, a
spokesman for Attorney General Marzuki Darusman.
</P>
<P>
   During a round of questioning at his home Monday morning,
Suharto personally signed the order placing him under house arrest,
although people who were there said he seemed halting, forgetful
and confused.
</P>
<P>
   During the three-hour session, Suharto ``had difficulty grasping
the questions because they were too long,'' said his lawyer, Juan
Felix Tampubolon. ``He haltingly tried to answer the questions, but
what came out was different. There were a lot of things he could
not remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's move came almost exactly two years after Suharto, the
all-powerful president for 32 years, stepped down _ on May 21, 1998
_ in the face of riots and student protests and under pressure from
defecting government ministers and even from his most loyal
military leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The two-week house arrest order, renewable in 30-day increments,
carried a powerful symbolism in a nation that is struggling,
sometimes chaotically, to convert itself from Suharto's iron-fisted
rule to an open democratic system.
</P>
<P>
   The order responds to an overwhelming public desire for
accountability that has shown itself most forcefully in frequent,
sometimes violent student demonstrations. These have taken place in
the dappled streets outside Suharto's home in a quiet neighborhood
of central Jakarta, where he lived throughout his presidency and
retreated in calm retirement two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It is also part of a broad government program to investigate and
potentially mete out punishment for a broad array of abuses ranging
as far back as the massacres of hundreds of thousands of people
during an anti-communist purge in 1965 and 1966, when Suharto
seized power.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto is accused of abusing his power in issuing presidential
decrees that he used to enrich himself, his six children and his
cronies and supporters. The case focuses particularly on seven
charitable trusts that Suharto fed by mandating donations from the
national budget.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general has said he expects the investigation to be
completed and any charges brought by Aug. 10. At that time,
President Abdurrahman Wahid must present the legislature with an
annual state-of the nation address.
</P>
<P>
   But much of Suharto's wealth, estimated in the billions or even
tens of billions of dollars, has so far been difficult to trace.
Like the so-called ``hidden wealth'' of former President Ferdinand
E. Marcos of the Philippines, who was forced from office in 1986,
it may never be recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many ways of laundering money,'' a diplomat said.
``This was a very methodical man.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Separate investigations have been opened against some of the
Suharto children, who continue to control large portions of the
Indonesian economy. The man known as Suharto's ``first friend,''
Bob Hasan, is also under investigation for corruption.
</P>
<P>
   These investigations, although seemingly slow and politically
difficult, are one of the clearest signs that Wahid's
administration represents a clear break with the past.
</P>
<P>
   His predecessor, B.J. Habibie, an acolyte of Suharto's who held
office for 17 months, tiptoed around the corruption issue and
formally dropped an investigation as one of his last and most
unpopular acts, just before being voted out of office in October.
</P>
<P>
   Days later, Marzuki, the new attorney general, reopened the
case, and in February Suharto was formally named a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   But, treading a delicate political line, Wahid has said he would
pardon Suharto if he is convicted, provided that he returns his
stolen wealth to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Though sick, disgraced and out of sight, Suharto remains one of
the dominant personalities in Indonesia. Until two years ago he was
the only president 65 percent of the population had ever known. The
nation's currency still carries his portrait.
</P>
<P>
   And although Suharto is out of power, his shadow still casts a
chill among many Indonesians. Many see his hand _ or the hand of
his disenfranchised supporters _ behind a continuing series of
destabilizing violent incidents around the country.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two days, at least four bombs have hit Christian
churches in the Sumatran city of Medan in this largely Muslim
nation of 210 million people. More than 60 people were reported
injured.
</P>
<P>
   Other violence that has been fomented or aggravated by outsiders
continued in the far eastern Spice Islands and in the north
Sumatran province of Aceh. In Jakarta during the weekend, student
protesters demanding a trial for Suharto turned violent, and many
analysts and officials said they believed that the violence was
instigated by paid agitators.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk of burning cars and vandalism and so on, that's
not done by students,'' said Mulya Lubis, who heads a
nongovernmental group that fights corruption. ``That's done by
people who want to provoke chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Juwono Sudarsono said: ``There are a lot of
people disgruntled with government, including former Cabinet
members, both civilian and military. They have too much money and
nothing to do and they want to frustrate the Gus Dur,'' the
nickname of Wahid.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's order for house arrest will allow investigators to
question the former president every day if they choose to, Yahya
said. He added without elaborating that it would also ``prevent him
from destroying evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Tampubolon objected, saying the house arrest order ``deviated
from the proper procedure, so we feel that it is a baseless
decision. There is no legal basis for such a move. Security is in
the hands of the police, not the attorney general.''
</P>
<P>
   The order was something of a retreat for the attorney general,
who had said he planned to move Suharto into government custody
elsewhere. That suggestion received opposition even from within the
Cabinet, where some members called it excessively harsh and warned
of the fragility of the former president's health.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a hard line, Marzuki warned on Friday that the large
deployment of police officers that has held protesters at bay in
front of Suharto's house would be withdrawn if he did not offer
more cooperation to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear, though, how Monday's formal detention order
would affect the course of the questioning, which apparently
proceeded as best it could earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The target has been met, meaning that all the questions have
been answered,'' said Dr. Supardi Sudibyo, head of the
state-appointed medical team for Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   Tampubolon had tried to cut short the session, complaining that
Suharto's blood pressure soared when he was questioned about the
charitable foundations. But Sudibyo said the former president's
blood pressure ``normally goes up after a questioning session.''

trees growing upside down and sculptures made out of tons of

   MICROBREWERS (Boston) _ The great beer awakening of the
mid-1990's suddenly jammed store aisles with fanciful brews like
Laughing Skull Bohemian Pilsner, Long Trail Double Bag Ale, Rogue
Shakespeare Stout and Pig's Eye Pilsner. For consumers used to
basic names like Coors and Bud, it was too much, too soon to
stomach. Some microbrewers collided head-on with distributors who
refused to carry their products and financiers who clamored for
profits even as sales growth slowed. Last year, for the first time,
more microbreweries in the United States closed than opened, and
more bottles will head for the clearance shelves this year. But
those craft brewers that lived through the shakeup _ and there are
many _ are telling a tale of leaner, more economical brewing, more
conservative growth, and more thoughtful business plans. They are
taking a breath before making another run on the American beer
market that is 80 percent controlled by Anheuser-Busch, Miller
Brewing and Coors. By Julie Flaherty.

   CHINA-INSURANCE (Shanghai) _ A look at foreign wrangling to grab
a piece of the untapped insurance market in China, and how that
might change after the country joins the World Trade Organization.
The Chinese have granted six of seven foreign insurance licenses to
American International Group, the financial services conglomerate
that was founded in China in the 1930's. But the favoritism shown
to the company has angered other foreign insurers, who contend that
China won't be able to behave that way once it joins the WTO. By
Craig S. Smith.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-POLLUTION (Baikalsk, Russia) _ Environmentalists in
Russia and abroad have accused the Baikalsk Pulp and Paper Mill of
polluting Lake Baikal in Siberia, the world's largest body of fresh
water. The issue goes beyond the lake. Throughout the former Soviet
Union, industry has turned the nation's waterways into
environmental catastrophes. By Russell Working.

 &HT;    Treating cancer with radioactive antibodies
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ When researchers over the past generation or so
have talked about looking for a magic bullet to attack cancer
cells, the drug Joan Martindale took last week was what they had in
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was to find some molecule on the cancer cells and
make an antibody to it,'' says Dr. Basel Yanes, the medical
director of oncology at Miami Valley Hospital. Antibodies attack
specific molecules, so if researchers could manufacture the
antibody and attach a radioactive element to it, they would have a
dedicated assassin for a particular cancer cell.
</P>
<P>
   ``After two decades of working on it, this is really the first
treatment we have with radioactive antibodies,'' Yanes says. Where
radiation and chemotherapy have traditionally attacked cancer cells
with a machine-gun spray, killing healthy cells in hopes of
destroying the cancer along with them, Yanes says, ``This is the
first treatment available where we can target the treatment
directly to the cancer cell.''
</P>
<P>
   Martindale's antibody attacks the cells of a slow-growing
lymphoma for which there has been no satisfactory treatment. In
preliminary research over two years, doctors said last week that
the tumors shrank in 97 percent of patients using the new drug,
Bexxar, and apparently disappeared in 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bexxar is six months to a year from approval for commercial use.
But it's available in clinical trials at eight hospitals from
Pennsylvania to Illinois, including Miami Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was apprehensive,'' says Martindale, a Centerville woman who
pronounces her first name Jo Ann. ``It's virgin territory. You
don't know what you're getting yourself into. But I have a lot of
faith in Dr. Yanes, and if the research is positive, it will be a
great step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami Valley's trial is for patients who have tried chemotherapy
unsuccessfully, but the Dayton Clinical Oncology Program has a
similar trial for newly diagnosed lymphoma. Bexxar consists of two
doses a week or two apart and generally has side effects no worse
than a brief bout of flu, as opposed to chemotherapy's many weeks'
duration ravaging the whole body.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a whole new concept in cancer therapy,'' Yanes says.
``We hope these new drugs will be more targeted and less toxic and
more effective.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with destroying cancer cells is that they are very
good at hiding from the natural immune system, which is why science
has turned to the laboratory for creating synthetic antibodies.
Bexxar is attracted to a particular protein that is on the surface
of virtually all lymphoma cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another approach is to target molecular defects at the genetic
level and find the drug that targets these enzymes or these certain
areas that control the growth of cancer cells,'' Yanes says.
``We're getting much smarter now because we understand how the
cancer cells grow. We have all these genetic abnormalities
identified.''
</P>
<P>
   The remaining task is to make drugs that block the chemical
signal that stimulates cancer growth, or that shut down the enzyme
that helps a tumor grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the beginning,'' Yanes says. ``In the next
decade, we're going to have many of these new drugs. Many of them
are now available in clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just joined a trial for pancreatic carcinoma. In another
trial that's not here, they've literally targeted drugs for
leukemia. All these drugs do the same thing. They identify the
defect that causes cancer cells to grow, and they attack it.''

part of a field coming to be called regenerative medicine. At Geron
Corporation, scientists have already turned embryonic stem cells
into heart muscle cells that spontaneously beat in the test tube.
Studies in mice have shown these cells stably integrate into the
heart. Eventually stem cell therapy might be used to rebuild hearts
after a heart attack, since heart muscles do not regenerate
themselves after they are killed. By Andrew Pollack. (600 words)

   SCI-MILLER-EVOLUTION (Undated) _ A conversation With Geoffrey F.
Miller, an evolutionary psychologist at University College, London.
As Dr. Miller sees it, the most outstanding features of the human
mind _ its creativity, its consciousness, its moral sense, its
artfulness and its love of a good punchline _ were shaped, not by
natural selection, as most biologists have assumed, but by the
other strong evolutionary force called sexual selection. In this
view, which he lays out in a newly published book called ``The
Mating Mind,'' humans are imaginative, artistic, humorous, and
relatively amiable for the same reason that peacocks fan their
fancy tails and cicadas thrum through the summer: to attract mates
and hence increase their so-called reproductive success. By Natalie
Angier. (1745 words)

the camera and light source, radio transmitter and batteries within
a sealed capsule slightly more than an inch long and less than half

   SCI-SEADRAGONS (Undated) _ Normally, the sea dragon is the most
popular exhibit at the Long Beach Aquarium of the Pacific, but
lately its even more excitement is buzzing around its tank: one of
the weedy males is pregnant, with about 100 bright pink eggs
hanging prominently onto his tail. What has the aquarium world
watching so closely is not that the mother is a male: sea dragons
are among one of two fish groups whose males incubate the eggs.
Rather it is the hope that this notably sensitive species might
actually reproduce away from its natural habitat. No one has done

FORMER INDONESIAN PRESIDENT SUHARTO UNDER HOUSE ARREST 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS 4th graf to add `an acknowledgment of')  
(EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Under intense public pressure to get tough,
the Indonesian government placed former President Suharto under
house arrest Monday as it sought to bring him to trial for
corruption and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto, 78, has been debilitated by three strokes and is
apparently able to communicate _ sometimes incoherently _ only in
his native Javanese language. He has managed, with the help of his
lawyers, to complicate repeated attempts by investigators to
question him in his home.
</P>
<P>
   The house arrest, which does not materially change Suharto's
living conditions, was instituted ``to smooth the investigation and
in order to finish the case as scheduled,'' said Yushar Yahya, a
spokesman for Attorney General Marzuki Darusman.
</P>
<P>
   During a round of questioning at his home Monday morning,
Suharto personally signed an acknowledgment of the order placing
him under house arrest, although people who were there said he
seemed halting, forgetful and confused.
</P>
<P>
   During the three-hour session, Suharto ``had difficulty grasping
the questions because they were too long,'' said his lawyer, Juan
Felix Tampubolon. ``He haltingly tried to answer the questions, but
what came out was different. There were a lot of things he could
not remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's move came almost exactly two years after Suharto, the
all-powerful president for 32 years, stepped down _ on May 21, 1998
_ in the face of riots and student protests and under pressure from
defecting government ministers and even from his most loyal
military leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The two-week house arrest order, renewable in 30-day increments,
carried a powerful symbolism in a nation that is struggling,
sometimes chaotically, to convert itself from Suharto's iron-fisted
rule to an open democratic system.
</P>
<P>
   The order responds to an overwhelming public desire for
accountability that has shown itself most forcefully in frequent,
sometimes violent student demonstrations. These have taken place in
the dappled streets outside Suharto's home in a quiet neighborhood
of central Jakarta, where he lived throughout his presidency and
retreated in calm retirement two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It is also part of a broad government program to investigate and
potentially mete out punishment for a broad array of abuses ranging
as far back as the massacres of hundreds of thousands of people
during an anti-communist purge in 1965 and 1966, when Suharto
seized power.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto is accused of abusing his power in issuing presidential
decrees that he used to enrich himself, his six children and his
cronies and supporters. The case focuses particularly on seven
charitable trusts that Suharto fed by mandating donations from the
national budget.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general has said he expects the investigation to be
completed and any charges brought by Aug. 10. At that time,
President Abdurrahman Wahid must present the legislature with an
annual state-of the nation address.
</P>
<P>
   But much of Suharto's wealth, estimated in the billions or even
tens of billions of dollars, has so far been difficult to trace.
Like the so-called ``hidden wealth'' of former President Ferdinand
E. Marcos of the Philippines, who was forced from office in 1986,
it may never be recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many ways of laundering money,'' a diplomat said.
``This was a very methodical man.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Separate investigations have been opened against some of the
Suharto children, who continue to control large portions of the
Indonesian economy. The man known as Suharto's ``first friend,''
Bob Hasan, is also under investigation for corruption.
</P>
<P>
   These investigations, although seemingly slow and politically
difficult, are one of the clearest signs that Wahid's
administration represents a clear break with the past.
</P>
<P>
   His predecessor, B.J. Habibie, an acolyte of Suharto's who held
office for 17 months, tiptoed around the corruption issue and
formally dropped an investigation as one of his last and most
unpopular acts, just before being voted out of office in October.
</P>
<P>
   Days later, Marzuki, the new attorney general, reopened the
case, and in February Suharto was formally named a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   But, treading a delicate political line, Wahid has said he would
pardon Suharto if he is convicted, provided that he returns his
stolen wealth to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Though sick, disgraced and out of sight, Suharto remains one of
the dominant personalities in Indonesia. Until two years ago he was
the only president 65 percent of the population had ever known. The
nation's currency still carries his portrait.
</P>
<P>
   And although Suharto is out of power, his shadow still casts a
chill among many Indonesians. Many see his hand _ or the hand of
his disenfranchised supporters _ behind a continuing series of
destabilizing violent incidents around the country.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two days, at least four bombs have hit Christian
churches in the Sumatran city of Medan in this largely Muslim
nation of 210 million people. More than 60 people were reported
injured.
</P>
<P>
   Other violence that has been fomented or aggravated by outsiders
continued in the far eastern Spice Islands and in the north
Sumatran province of Aceh. In Jakarta during the weekend, student
protesters demanding a trial for Suharto turned violent, and many
analysts and officials said they believed that the violence was
instigated by paid agitators.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk of burning cars and vandalism and so on, that's
not done by students,'' said Mulya Lubis, who heads a
nongovernmental group that fights corruption. ``That's done by
people who want to provoke chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Juwono Sudarsono said: ``There are a lot of
people disgruntled with government, including former Cabinet
members, both civilian and military. They have too much money and
nothing to do and they want to frustrate the Gus Dur,'' the
nickname of Wahid.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's order for house arrest will allow investigators to
question the former president every day if they choose to, Yahya
said. He added without elaborating that it would also ``prevent him
from destroying evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Tampubolon objected, saying the house arrest order ``deviated
from the proper procedure, so we feel that it is a baseless
decision. There is no legal basis for such a move. Security is in
the hands of the police, not the attorney general.''
</P>
<P>
   The order was something of a retreat for the attorney general,
who had said he planned to move Suharto into government custody
elsewhere. That suggestion received opposition even from within the
Cabinet, where some members called it excessively harsh and warned
of the fragility of the former president's health.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a hard line, Marzuki warned on Friday that the large
deployment of police officers that has held protesters at bay in
front of Suharto's house would be withdrawn if he did not offer
more cooperation to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear, though, how Monday's formal detention order
would affect the course of the questioning, which apparently
proceeded as best it could earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The target has been met, meaning that all the questions have
been answered,'' said Dr. Supardi Sudibyo, head of the
state-appointed medical team for Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   Tampubolon had tried to cut short the session, complaining that
Suharto's blood pressure soared when he was questioned about the
charitable foundations. But Sudibyo said the former president's
blood pressure ``normally goes up after a questioning session.''

THE CHORES OF SELECTING A PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Friday's Wall Street Journal reported that the Gore campaign,
concerned because Bush seems to be ``doing better'' among female
voters, convened a focus group to ask women which candidate would
be a better date.
</P>
<P>
   The news was good for Gore: ``Though not a dream date, he was
deemed thoughtful, reflective, and interested in what women have to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was thought to be ``the type who would drive up in a flashy
convertible, honk the horn instead of coming to the door, lean
against his car chewing gum, and spend all night talking about
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   So why is Bush ``doing better'' with women than Gore? Well,
women have a weakness for flashy convertibles. And, as another poll
indicated, Bush has a big lead among married voters because Gore,
although by all accounts a fine family man, is tainted by
association with the first philanderer.
</P>
<P>
   Dating is one thing; a long-term relationship is another. The
same might be said of presidential politics. Campaigning is one
thing; what happens in the White House is something else.
</P>
<P>
   When I'm politically confused, I find it helpful to try to
imagine the candidates doing domestic chores. In this light,
neither one is any bargain.
</P>
<P>
   For example, who would you trust to feed the cats?
</P>
<P>
   Bush would ask, ``Why can't they feed themselves?'' But he'd be
willing to help, as long as you laid out the cat food for him and
gave him detailed instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Gore would feed the cats but criticize your choice of cat food,
and he'd feel obliged to point out that the cats are better
nourished than many third-world people.
</P>
<P>
   If you asked for help cleaning the house?
</P>
<P>
   Bush would call a cleaning service, one that accepts payments in
cash.
</P>
<P>
   Gore would pitch in, using only environmentally sound cleaning
materials that wouldn't get the sludge off your oven. Sometime
later, your dirty stove would figure in a campaign speech about the
compromises we must make if we care about Planet Earth.
</P>
<P>
   If you wanted advice choosing a color to paint the living room?
</P>
<P>
   Gore would say he'd love to help but that it was impossible to
choose just one color because he loves all colors equally.
</P>
<P>
   Bush would tell you to go ahead and paint it any color you like,
as long as it's white.
</P>
<P>
   If you found a mouse in the kitchen?
</P>
<P>
   Bush would whack it with a stick. Then he'd tell anybody who'd
listen that he learned to kill mice that way when he was a boy in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Gore would trap the mouse humanely. Then he'd call a press
conference, make a speech about the importance of respecting
wildlife, and release the mouse unharmed, into its natural habitat,
your backyard.
</P>
<P>
   If you asked for help with a neighborhood barbecue?
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates would turn it into a fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Bush would fire up the mesquite and make a big production of
cooking a chunk of meat slathered with his special Texas sauce. It
would be delicious, but you'd get stuck cleaning up the mess.
</P>
<P>
   Gore would gather the neighbors around and explain the
ecological wisdom of using a gas grill. Then he'd describe, in
detail, exactly how he planned to cook free-range chicken and
organic vegetables. By the time he finished talking and started
grilling, everybody would have gone home.

Fish and Wildlife Service is expected to adopt a controversial plan
to put grizzly bears back in the Bitterroot region. A 15-member
committee will be charged with finding a way for the bears to
flourish and exist with humans, particulary those engaged in

travels through a vacuum, about 186,000 miles per second, is
enshrined in physics lore as a universal speed limit. Nothing can
travel faster than that speed, the textbooks say. But now, two new
mind-bending experiments have demonstrated how wrong that

   SCI-CELL-IMPLANTS (Undated) _ Hope is growing that neural cells
implanted into the brain can replace cells and restore functions
lost to stroke, spinal cord injury or neurological diseases like
Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, most of which have no effective

   SCI-CELL-THERAPY () _ Stem cells, the master cells from which
all other cells in the body develop, might be used to replenish
many other tissues in the brain. Companies are already trying to
harness the cells to rebuild hearts, bone, blood and other tissues,
part of a field coming to be called regenerative medicine. At Geron
Corporation, scientists have already turned embryonic stem cells
into heart muscle cells that spontaneously beat in the test tube.
Studies in mice have shown these cells stably integrate into the
heart. Eventually stem cell therapy might be used to rebuild hearts
after a heart attack, since heart muscles do not regenerate
themselves after they are killed. By Andrew Pollack. (600 words)

   SCI-MILLER-EVOLUTION (Undated) _ A conversation With Geoffrey F.
Miller, an evolutionary psychologist at University College, London.
As Dr. Miller sees it, the most outstanding features of the human
mind _ its creativity, its consciousness, its moral sense, its
artfulness and its love of a good punchline _ were shaped, not by
natural selection, as most biologists have assumed, but by the
other strong evolutionary force called sexual selection. In this
view, which he lays out in a newly published book called ``The
Mating Mind,'' humans are imaginative, artistic, humorous, and
relatively amiable for the same reason that peacocks fan their
fancy tails and cicadas thrum through the summer: to attract mates
and hence increase their so-called reproductive success. By Natalie
Angier. (1745 words)

<P>
   SCI-SWALLOWED-CAMERA (Undated) _ They haven't figured out how to
squeeze Raquel Welch into it, but scientists with an Israeli
company have made a pill-sized videocamera that takes a fantastic
voyage of its own, traveling through the digestive tract and
transmitting pictures along the way. The device, which consists of
the camera and light source, radio transmitter and batteries within
a sealed capsule slightly more than an inch long and less than half
an inch wide, is intended as a less invasive way to examine the

   SCI-SEADRAGONS (Undated) _ Normally, the sea dragon is the most
popular exhibit at the Long Beach Aquarium of the Pacific, but
lately its even more excitement is buzzing around its tank: one of
the weedy males is pregnant, with about 100 bright pink eggs
hanging prominently onto his tail. What has the aquarium world
watching so closely is not that the mother is a male: sea dragons
are among one of two fish groups whose males incubate the eggs.
Rather it is the hope that this notably sensitive species might
actually reproduce away from its natural habitat. No one has done

   Q. I invest in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts' Deferred

rolling my account into a plan offered by IMCA Retirement Corp.,
which focuses on Vantagepoint funds, although other funds are
available. What do you see as the pros and cons of this plan? How
much might I expect to have by ages 55 and 60?
</P>
<P>
   D.E., Dunstable, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If you plan to focus on the Vantagepoint funds featured in
the four model portfolios offered in the literature that you sent
along, the chief con is their youth. Given your current
investments, the only portfolio that might serve your goals is
Long-Term Growth, which holds shares in seven different
Vantagepoint funds.
</P>
<P>
   All of these funds are less than a year and a half old, and
while a couple of them have produced respectable results so far _
the Aggressive Opportunities fund has a 26.69 percent one-year
record as this is written, and the Vantagepoint International fund
has an 18.69 percent one-year record _ I think there is just not
enough data to evaluate these funds.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, with a 20 percent position in Vantagepoint's Core Bond
Index fund, the long-term growth prospects are automatically dimmed
by a considerable factor. (Although in fairness, the bond fund is
the only one of the seven offerings that is above water in
year-to-date results, with a 1.17 percent year-to-date return.)
</P>
<P>
   For those reasons, I suggest you look to the 13 funds from other
families that are offered through IMCA. Looking at that list, you
might select Fidelity Blue Chip Growth fund as a reasonable proxy
for AIM Weingarten fund, and select either Fidelity Magellan or
Fidelity Contrafund to serve the slot in your portfolio formerly
held by Vanguard Index 500. American Century Ultra fund might then
take the place of Fidelity Growth Company fund.
</P>
<P>
   If you were to keep saving at an $8,000 annual rate and achieved
10 percent average total returns, you would have $1,542,108 at age
55, and $2,638,212 in the deferred compensation plan at age 60.
</P>
<P>
   Problem: Selling a rental property
</P>
<P>
   Rental: $1,000 monthly
</P>
<P>
   Value of house: $165,000
</P>
<P>
   Q. I own a house that I rent, and I use part of the rentals to
cover living expenses. The tenant wants to buy the house, and if I
sell it, I would need to invest the proceeds to replace the rental
income. What investment would you suggest?
</P>
<P>
   W.D., Winchester, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. This is a solid plan, especially once you calculate the
taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs you are paying out of your
$1,000 monthly rental income.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, since you presumably would not be going through a real
estate agent in arranging the sale, you would net almost all of the
$165,000 gross proceeds, less the amount of your legal and closing
costs.
</P>
<P>
   You should, of course, explore your potential tax liabilities
resulting from the sale, but it seems likely that you would be well
ahead of the game in selling.
</P>
<P>
   Entering this week, the nation's best rate from a five-year
jumbo CD was 8.06 percent. (A jumbo is a CD for $100,000 or more;
the best rate on a CD of less than $100,000 was 8.05 percent.) At
the higher rate you would need to have a little less than $147,000
invested in such a CD to produce an income stream of $12,000 a
year. Your after-tax proceeds from a sale probably would exceed the
current net income from the property _ the gross rental minus
taxes, insurance, and maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   If you do go along with the CD plan, keep in mind that interest
from an out-of-state bank is taxed at a higher rate on your state
income tax than interest from a Massachusetts bank.
</P>
<P>
   Problem: Retirement income
</P>
<P>
   Age: 59 1/2
</P>
<P>
   Savings: $801,320
</P>
<P>
   25 percent bonds
</P>
<P>
   65 percent stocks and stock funds
</P>
<P>
   10 percent cash, CDs, and money market holdings
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have no debt except a 15-year mortgage of $115,000. I spend
about $50,000 a year in today's dollars. I stopped working at the
end of January and would like to continue to be retired.
</P>
<P>
   As of April 1, I had the investments outlined. If I start
collecting Social Security at age 62, I will collect $11,400
annually; I will get about $16,000 a year if I wait until age 65.
</P>
<P>
   I have set out a spreadsheet projection that includes an average
portfolio return of 8 percent, a 20 percent tax rate, and inflation
running at 3 percent. This showed that I would have enough money to
last until I am about 88 years old _ actually probably not enough,
since my mother lived to be 89.
</P>
<P>
   What suggestions can you make so that I can achieve my goal?
Since the market is so bad right now, I feel I have enough cash to
leave everything as it is. Nevertheless I do worry as the market
gets worse and worse, and wonder if I shouldn't change the
distribution a bit. What do you think?
</P>
<P>
   R.M., Watertown, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I would be more than a bit nervous about this plan if I were
you.
</P>
<P>
   First, as you point out, your money would run out before you
died if you lived to the age of 89 _ and that's not dealing with
the prospect that the wonders of modern medicine will make
nonagenarians a good deal more common in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Second, your assumption of a 3 percent inflation rate is giving
yourself the best of it. I usually use 3.5 percent as a projection
against inflation, and sometimes I get nervous about even that
number.
</P>
<P>
   Third, when you include the state tax liabilities along with the
federal tax bill, that expense might go beyond 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the major thing that makes me worry about your plan is that
huge chunk of the portfolio that's in stocks and stock funds. With
only 35 percent of your portfolio in bonds and cash instruments,
you can count on the fixed-income portfolio to produce only about
$18,000 as an income stream.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset, that means you will be looking to your stock
portfolio to bring in the other $32,000. It's unlikely the dividend
stream from your stocks and funds would represent much more than
$10,000, and it's probable that the figure is less. But at best,
you are looking for the stock portfolio to generate about $22,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Is this reasonable? Certainly it seems to work on paper, since
that $22,000 represents a market return (exclusive of the yield) of
only about 4.2 percent. But plans such as this can go awry quickly
if the stock market delivers not gains but losses in the early
years of the going. I am not predicting doom, but I do suggest that
you would be in a better situation if you reduced your reliance on
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure what to suggest. As I said, I'd like to see the
fixed-income side of the portfolio beefed up a bit. In addition, I
suggest you rework your outline in several ways. One would be to
plug in the higher level of Social Security beginning at age 65,
letting you see whether that change improves the long-term outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Another change I'd suggest is to plug in 3.5 percent as an
estimate of inflation. And you might want to consider the
possibility that your total tax liabilities might run closer to 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
   With these results in mind, you could then consider a couple of
other options, both of them viscerally unpleasant. One would be to
take on some part-time work for the next few years _ perhaps
setting a goal of earning enough money so that you could live on
the actual portfolio yield plus your part-time income. Another
approach would be to try to rebudget so that you would be spending
a bit less.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, one factor works in your favor. Unless I am misreading
your spreadsheet, I don't see a calculation of the effect that
paying off your mortgage after 15 years will have on the question
of how long your money will last. If you reduced the amount you
would be withdrawing from your savings by about $12,000 a year at
that point, the figures would look considerably better.

 &HT;    Sick buildings make unhealthy working world
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The World Health Organization estimates that one of
every three workers is toiling in a workplace that makes them sick.
The culprit, says Business Week (June 5), is ``a stew of largely
undetected dangers, from the carbon monoxide and other contaminants
sucked into a building ... to volatile organic chemicals seeping
out of building materials.''
</P>
<P>
   The Occupational Health and Safety Administration has standards
that are supposed to protect workers against individual
contaminants, but the standards were set for industrial workplaces
and have been ``force-fit to apply to white-collar offices.''
</P>
<P>
   An OSHA official tells Business Week, ``There is no federally
guaranteed protection from exposure to unhealthy air indoors.''
</P>
<P>
   WHERE THE RICH ARE
</P>
<P>
   A million dollars isn't what it used to be in America's richest
towns, Worth (June) discovered in researching its fifth annual list
of the nation's 250 richest communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get a fully loaded house _ a kitchen befitting a four-star
chef; bathrooms as big as the Ritz; top-of-the-line media rooms;
marble fireplaces and cherry paneling _ home buyers are plunking
down much more than a mere million, and often in cash,'' the
magazine says.
</P>
<P>
   This year's top rich town is Jupiter Island, Fla., population
601, and median home sale price _ the unit by which the rich towns
were ranked _ of $1.98 million.
</P>
<P>
   Worth counted 76 rich towns in California, 46 in New York, 25 in
New Jersey, 18 in Massachusetts, 17 in Illinois and 12 in Florida _
and none in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The closest rich towns to Georgia were Kiawah Island, S.C., and
Biltmore Forest, near Asheville, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   RICH, BUT NOT SPOILED
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of wealth, Forbes (June 12) devotes its 13th annual
investment guide to raising your kid in an age of wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Handwringers say being born with a silver spoon will doom your
children's chances for success. Nonsense,'' says Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when a booming economy is producing unprecedented
wealth, the way to bring up kids so they won't be spoiled is to
teach them how to make their own money, the magazine advises.
</P>
<P>
   As for the investment guide itself, the magazine recommends that
everybody overhaul their investments to adjust to new tax laws and
lower the tax take on savings.
</P>
<P>
   AS FOR THE POOR...
</P>
<P>
   There's no disputing the fact there is a desperate labor
shortage among small businesses. But Inc. (June), a small- business
magazine, says this situation also has opened the doors for people
who wish to get off welfare.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt the transition from welfare to regular work can
be extremely trying for both employer and employee, the magazine
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``But CEOs are quickly finding that with the right training,
employees fresh off the welfare rolls can become valuable and
dependable parts of any business,'' the magazine adds.

WINNERS AND LOSERS IN THE TRADE BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the aftermath of Wednesday's congressional vote granting
China permanent normal trade relations, of PNTR, the tension that
defines the next chapter of our economic discourse was clear:
</P>
<P>
   Proclaimed President Clinton, ``Today the House . . . has taken
an historic step toward continued prosperity in America, reform in
China, and peace in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Countered AFL-CIO president John Sweeney, ``Without protections
for workers' rights and human rights and the environment, it is
certainly going to speed up the race to the bottom. . . . Good jobs
are bound to chase bad standards.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard not to sympathize with Sweeney, for when it comes to
trade, few interests are treated as cavalierly as those of
working-class Americans rightly suspicious of trade deals with
countries who find their competitive advantage not in productivity
or innovation but rather in low wages, repressed workers, and a
ravaged environment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when unions protest that Americans shouldn't be forced to
compete on that basis, they are rebuked as protectionist and
scolded that free trade with China is indubitably in the best
interest of America.
</P>
<P>
   But which America? That is the question underscored in the wake
of labor's big loss. The trade deal will have strikingly different
ramifications depending on one's place in the economic order. And
in the United States, unlike in parts of Scandinavia and elsewhere,
little attempt is made to ease the sting to workers by offering
them offsetting social benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not just talking about the rich getting richer and the
poor getting richer at a slower rate,'' says US Representative
Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat who opposed the deal and is
a leader in the fight for fairer trade. ``We are talking about the
rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those who support the permanent status for China
acknowledge that the differential impact of that commerce will
likely reward US workers with higher skills and more education
while increasing pressure on lesser-skilled workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any economist would agree that the effect is there,''
says William Cline, chief economist at the Institute of
International Finance, whose own work shows that trade pressures
work to impede blue-collar wages in this country.
</P>
<P>
   So who will suffer? ``If you are working in an automobile plant
or an electronics factory, if you are making steel, and certainly
if you are making apparel or toys or anything like that, all of
those are going to be directly threatened by PNTR for China,'' says
Robert E. Scott, international economist for the progressive
Economic Policy Institute.
</P>
<P>
   If the most visible casualty will be lost jobs for some workers,
a second insidious effect is lost bargaining power.
</P>
<P>
   ``When workers go into contract negotiations, time and again
they are told, `Hey, are you crazy, we will go and make this
somewhere else,' '' Frank says.
</P>
<P>
   Given the media's fascination with entrepreneurs, dot.coms, and
all things Internet, it is increasingly easy to lose sight of
working-class Americans. But in their new book, ``America's
Forgotten Majority: Why the White Working Class Still Matters,''
Ruy Teixeira and Joel Rogers contend that many more Americans than
is commonly realized work on the lower-skilled side of what the
writers term the ``great divide'' separating those who have
prospered in the new economy from those who have not.
</P>
<P>
   Teixeira and Rogers say the group tracked in their book, which
they identify as America's ``forgotten majority,'' makes up as much
as 55 percent of the US adult population.
</P>
<P>
   A portion of this group will face increased pressure from China,
says Teixeira, a senior fellow at The Century Foundation. ``For
people with less than a four-year degree, people who work in the
tradeable-goods sector, people who are more blue collar, the
competition is going to be stronger,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   That group has already felt its standard of living under siege,
something highlighted by wage data in the book.
</P>
<P>
   From 1979 to 1998, college-educated whites saw their real
(inflation-adjusted) median wage grow by 12 percent, while
working-class experienced an 8.6 percent real wage decline. High
school dropouts, meanwhile, suffered a real wage loss of an
astounding 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it a coincidence that the era of declining real wages for
many Americans has also been an era of increasing international
trade, says economist Mark Weisbrot, codirector of the Center for
Economic and Policy Research in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Weisbrot says the effect is best seen by comparing two eras.
From 1946-1973, the median US hourly wage increased by about 80
percent in real terms. But from 1973-1999, a period during which
the share of Gross Domestic Product devoted to trade has doubled,
the real median wage has not grown.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a drastic change from the previous 27 years,'' says
Weisbrot. ``And everybody admits trade has had a significant
effect.'' Exactly how significant is hard to say. Some estimates
say trade has caused 25 to 40 percent of the rise in US wage
inequality, while others put the effect as low as 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, as some assume, has trade proved a net creator of jobs.
While it's true that rising exports created about 4.1 million jobs
from 1992-1999, rising imports cost us about 7.3 million jobs in
the same period, for a net loss of 3.2 million actual and potential
jobs, according to an analysis by Scott, of the Economic Policy
Institute. His general findings are seconded by others in the
field, though with the caveat that domestic growth at a pace that
created another 3.2 million jobs might well have nudged the Federal
Reserve toward earlier interest rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   These losses have hit disproportionately in the sectors that
employ less educated and less skilled workers.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, says Cline, the rising flow of cheaper imports
from abroad clearly kept inflation low and allowed for lower
interest rates. On the other hand, a trade deficit the magnitude of
ours is clearly unsustainable over time and thus will eventually
put downward pressure on the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the perverse logic that lets free trade with
developing countries justify a race to the bottom rather than a
rise to a minimum set of standards also works to undercut
meaningful efforts at international environmental progress.
</P>
<P>
   Frank cites as an example the Kyoto Protocols on reducing
industrial emissions that contribute to global warming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a perfect Catch-22,'' the congressman says. ``The people
who say give China PNTR without conditions cite the fact that China
is industrializing as a reason we can't ratify the Kyoto
agreements. But if we say, let's make China worrying about global
warming as part of PNTR, they say that is an interference with free
trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly a tougher ``fair trade'' agenda has widespread
support; in the last several years, a variety of public opinion
polls have shown that US citizens overwhelmingly favor including
labor and environmental standards in trade deals _ and penalizing
countries who fail to abide by those standards.
</P>
<P>
   Classic free-trade theory would say that even with all the ill
effects, we would still be better off trading openly with countries
like China because even with the lost jobs and eroded income, those
who have gained could subsidize those who have lost and still leave
the country as a whole better off.
</P>
<P>
   Which is just the sort of argument that economic theorists offer
to assuage concerns that trade with low-wage countries catalyzes a
growing inequality here. But though some Scandinavian countries
have crafted welfare states that attempt to do just that, this
country has made little attempt beyond retraining to redress
trade-based displacement.
</P>
<P>
   One reason, of course, is that most tangible and easily
identified benefits of such a deal will go to companies that open
operations in China, while the more general advantage _ cheaper
consumers goods _ are spread so broadly it is hard to measure, much
less to redistribute. (Access to those less expensive goods, Cline
argues, is a benefit that softens trade's impact on the
less-skilled workers here who have seen their real wages stagnate
over the last quarter-century.)
</P>
<P>
   Instead, says Bluestone, ``the argument ends up as, `Well, there
are going to be some losers, but it is up to them to get more
skills or retraining so they can do better, and if they don't,
that's the price they pay.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Frank says he and other liberals would be more inclined to
support something like PNTR status for China if some sort of
compensation for American workers _ say, universal health care _
came as part of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   But absent any compensatory benefits, it's hard not to conclude
that the totemistic devotion to free trade no matter the partner
leaves an important Democratic Party constituency increasingly in
the lurch.
</P>
<P>
   The political question is obvious: Will the trade deal with
China lessen support for Democratic nominee-to-be Al Gore among
working men and women? After all, the United Auto Workers, fed up
with the administration's trade posture, are now flirting with
Green Party candidate Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Sweeney says the AFL-CIO will stick with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have differences with him on trade . . . but he has assured
us that labor standards, workers' rights, and environmental
concerns are going to be part of our trade negotiations when he is
elected president,'' the labor chief told the Globe in an interview
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Yet others aren't so sure the working-class center will hold for
the Democrats without a trade policy that more clearly defends
their economic interests.
</P>
<P>
   Teixeira says that if his ``forgotten majority,'' already
vaguely suspicious of government, comes to conclude the Democratic
Party is no longer concerned about their economic interests, they
may migrate to the Republicans on other issues, even though the GOP
is even more enthusiastic about China trade than the Democrats.
(White male voters have already started that journey; a recent
Washington Post/ABC poll showed Bush leading Gore 58 percent to 35
percent among that demographic.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It is pretty clear that a lot of these people view these trade
deals as not being in their interest,'' Teixeira said. ``For people
for whom George W. is not unattractive to begin with, it may help
push them further in a direction they are already willing to
contemplate.''

WHEN DIPLOMATIC, COMMERCIAL INTERESTS COLLIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The very month the Continental Congress accepted
Thomas Jefferson's draft declaring America's freedom from Great
Britain, it asked John Adams to draft a second important document _
a model treaty the new nation would use to win free trade
agreements with other nations.
</P>
<P>
   That document, drafted in 1776 with the assistance of Benjamin
Franklin, established the United States from the start as a trading
nation committed to open markets.
</P>
<P>
   But over the years, the United States has practiced that
philosophy in a broader way than its authors probably envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   American presidents have often used trade policy to promote
diplomatic and political goals, just as they have often used
diplomatic policy to promote trade goals. And while some of the
earthquakes that have rumbled through American history _ the Civil
War, for example, or World War II _ have been predominantly moral
conflicts, even they have had important trade elements.
</P>
<P>
   The flurry of lobbying, last-minute deal-making, passionate
pleading, and agonized balloting on the House floor last week _
probably the only vote of enduring significance for the entire year
on Capitol Hill _ shed light on a little-appreciated aspect of
American political culture: the notion that our diplomatic
interests and our commercial interests are often more intertwined
than presidents, lawmakers, and lobbyists acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   There have always been strong voices and votes for protectionism
in the United States. The Smoot-Hawley Tariff, for example, raised
trade barriers in 1930, and although it also provoked retaliation
against US exports, many historians no longer include it among the
causes of the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   Though the economic historian Alfred E. Eckes Jr. argues that,
at the end of the 19th century, ``a protectionist America and a
protectionist Germany both outperformed free trade Britain,''
American policymakers in the modern era generally have favored
free-trade policies. Overall, they have endorsed a view expressed
by New Deal-era Secretary of State Cordell Hull, a former Tennessee
congressman and senator who hailed, not insignificantly, from Vice
President Al Gore's hometown:
</P>
<P>
   ``Toward 1916 I embraced the philosophy I carried throughout my
12 years as Secretary of State,'' Hull said. ``From then on, to me,
unhampered trade dovetailed with peace; high tariffs, trade
barriers, and unfair economic competition, with war.''
</P>
<P>
   Tariffs have been at the heart of American political debate from
the very beginning. The first tariff, providing for duties on some
30 commodities, was enacted on July 4 of the first year of the
Constitution, 1789. Two years later, Alexander Hamilton's famous
``Report on Manufactures'' called for tariff walls to foster
American industry.
</P>
<P>
   Take away slavery and Reconstruction, and much of 19th- century
American history can be distilled down to a debate over trade; the
first angry breath of true states' rights sentiment came not over
slavery but over an 1828 tariff that Southerners considered so
onerous that they called it the Tariff of Abominations. American
sentiment constantly shifted between two poles, one holding that
foreign trade and foreign capital provided the engine of American
growth, the other that the US internal market was big enough to
sustain enormous growth on its own.
</P>
<P>
   But the concept of opening other nations to American goods was
seldom disputed.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, nothing raises American hackles more than the idea that
American goods can't win a fair shake in the world market.
</P>
<P>
   The undeclared war with France between 1798 and 1801 was
triggered by a dispute over neutral rights and the seizure of
American vessels in the West Indies. The War of 1812 was prompted
by restrictions on American traders, and though national honor and
the impressment of American sailors were important elements in the
struggle, so was the idea that the British were excluding Americans
from continental markets.
</P>
<P>
   The United States joined the first great moral war of the 20th
century, World War I, after Germany embarked in January 1917 on a
policy of unrestricted submarine warfare, endangering the full
neutral trading rights that Woodrow Wilson pledged to protect. In
his War Message on April 2, 1917, Wilson said that ``the right is
more precious than peace,'' and though he enumerated several of
what he called ``the things we have always carried nearest our
hearts'' _ and though he fought the war for important moral
principles _ American entry into the war was provoked in large
measure by trade questions.
</P>
<P>
   The parade of business factors through American diplomatic
history is long and loud: the role of the cotton trade in Civil War
diplomacy. The lure of Asian commerce in the War of 1898, commonly
called the Spanish-American War. The attraction of Latin commerce
in 1898 and again in the 1940s and 1950s, when American money and
arms propped up convenient dictatorships in our own hemisphere. The
high stakes of oil politics, which led to strains with Japan in the
1930s, with Iran in the 1950s, and with Iraq in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout American history, an ungainly coalition of free
traders has claimed the high ground in domestic politics and in
diplomatic debates. The free-trade doctrine was established firmly
as US policy in modern times with a 1962 trade law that reduced
tariff barriers substantially. The lower American tariffs generally
encouraged lower barriers worldwide and set the stage for dramatic
acts such as the 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement, which
removed virtually all trade walls among the United States, Mexico,
and Canada, and allowed free-traders to dream of hemispheric
free-trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
   But while the free-trade mythology marched from triumph to
triumph, other domestic factors were shifting, and as a result the
traditional political alliances have been altered dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats and their allies in the union movement, once
reliable apostles of free trade, grew wary of environmental and
workplace practices in developing countries and grew worried about
the security of American workers in a world market full of cheap
labor. More of them came to oppose international trade agreements.
The Republicans and their allies in business, once determined to
protect American industry behind tariff walls, became intrugued by
the potential of larger markets for American goods and less
expensive workers for American companies. More of them came to
support trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, much of the support for the just-passed China
legislation, backed by a Democratic president, came from Clinton's
party rivals. Republicans voted by a 3-to-1 margin for the trade
bill. Democrats voted against it by about 2-to-1. In the end, it
took 164 Republicans and 73 Democrats to pass the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   This is a new era for trade politics, but also a new era in
American diplomacy. With the Cold War over and with no dictators
providing the sort of threat to Western democracy that Fascism and
Nazism posed in the 1930s and 1940s, trade questions now are far
more openly a part of American power calculations than they were in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Policy makers have stepped back and realized the two are
inseparable, and that they have been insparabale,'' said Susan C.
Schwab, dean of the School of Public Affairs at the University of
Maryland. ``America has always been a commercial nation and has
always used the economic and commercial tools in its foreign-policy
basket. Right now those tools are being used openly both for
traditional foreign-policy ends and for economic and commercial
ends. And now that the Cold War is over, the economic interests and
economic tools are clearly in the ascension.''
</P>
<P>
   They are, in fact, reclaiming the position they held in 1776,
when John Adams's draft treaty called for nations to provide
Americans with all the ``liberties, priviliges, immunities and
exemptions in trade, navigation, and commerce'' that they provided
to their own citizens. The open door beckons to us still.

 &HT;    Time spotlights drugs in Georgia county
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a troubling cover story on the illegal drug
Ecstasy, Time ($3.50) correspondent John Cloud reports that the
elixir best-known for powering ``raves'' is now readily available
from Georgia to Michigan. He begins his article with a scene from
an unnamed Cobb County high school as 18-year-old ``Karen'' and
five friends skip class and go into the woods to take the pills.
That night they'll go out and drop more Ecstasy, he says. ``The
cliques are pretty big in my school,'' Karen says, ``and every
clique does it.'' Users believe the drug is safer than heroine or
cocaine, but researchers are still studying its long-term effects
on the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Real TV: Undaunted by the failure of Fox's ``Who Wants to Marry
a Multimillionaire,'' CBS is airing ``Survivor,'' a 13-part
``reality'' show in which eight men and eight women are dropped on
a remote island. The last one who survives the whims of Mother
Nature and the TV audience gets $1 million. Newsweek ($3.50) talked
with four of the participants about their experiences and found
that one of them had resorted to eating roasted rats. They tasted,
of course, ``like chicken.''
</P>
<P>
   Cyber rich: More than 150 years ago, the American West was
changed when the forty-niners struck gold. Now the West has been
changed again by another group that has struck it rich with
something even more precious than gold: computer chips. Town &AMP;
Country ($4), the magazine that keeps tabs on the wealthy, examines
the new millionaires of Silicon Valley to see how they're living
and spending their money. Some have become passionate
philanthropists, while others have flocked to the Pacific Northwest
in search of adventure. In the Puget Sound area alone, there are
more than 60,000 households with a net worth of $1 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   Eye of the storm: Batten down the hatches. With George Clooney
and his crew heading to theaters this summer in ``The Perfect
Storm,'' Outside ($3.95) goes behind the scenes to explain how the
best-selling book by Sebastian Junger became Hollywood's next great
adventure epic. The $120 million movie is loaded with special
effects, but Clooney says the unexpected appearance of Hurricane
Floyd allowed them to save about a million dollars. ``You can see
it in the movie _ it's real weather, and it makes a difference.''
And, adds Clooney, don't expect a Hollywood ending.
</P>
<P>
   Style and substance: There's no question that Architectural
Digest ($4.95) has wonderful photography, but the glossy magazine
is more than just pretty pictures of elegant houses and expensive
antiques. In the June issue, author Tobias Wolff (``This Boy's
Life'') tells a tongue-in-cheek cautionary tale about the woes of
owning a second home. ``I quickly learned that you don't own houses
_ they own you,'' he writes. Other articles of interest include a
visit with Michael J. Fox and his wife, Tracy Pollan, at their
80-acre New England estate and a look at a trend in weekend homes:
tent cabins.
</P>
<P>
   Green peace: Rolling Stone ($4.95) talks with MTV's Tom Green
about how he's dealing with life after testicular cancer. At first
it was embarrassing, Green says, but then he and his girlfriend,
Drew Barrymore, decided to treat it like everything else in his
life _ with humor. Elsewhere in the magazine, Dan Baum takes aim at
the proliferation of gun shows. Since a law was passed in 1986
making it legal for gun dealers to sell firearms at these shows,
more than 4,400 such events are held every year.
</P>
<P>
   House of rock: All right, so you're never going to get your
picture on the cover of Rolling Stone. You can, however, be a rock
star _ briefly _ at Seattle's Experience Music Project. Smithsonian
($3) explores the new high-tech museum where visitors can perform
in an ``onstage'' exhibit complete with billowing smoke and crowd
noise, watch videos of Bo Diddley, teach themselves chords on
keyboards or guitars using computer tutorials, or get close-up
views of Jimi Hendrix's hat, Janis Joplin's boa and Eric Clapton's
guitar. The museum opens June 23.

TIME TO SLAM THE DOOR ON SECRET EVIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.)  
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   
 c.2000 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Suppose you were arrested and charged with a serious crime, but
the prosecutor refused to tell you or your attorney the nature of
the crime or the evidence against you. Doing so, according to the
prosecutor, would jeopardize national security. You don't know who
your accusers are; you don't even know the accusation against you.
</P>
<P>
   Sound crazy? Such Kafkaesque scenes are occurring in our nation
right now _ in the United States, not some South American
dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty
Act in 1996. It authorized the setting up of special Immigration
and Naturalization Service courts and the use of classified or
secret evidence against an accused that he and his attorney cannot
view. Only the special court judge can.
</P>
<P>
   The INS has used secret evidence in 75 cases against
non-citizens. There are currently 25 cases pending in INS special
courts which rely upon secret evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those accused using secret evidence are Arabs or Muslims
_ a kind of government-sanctioned racism.
</P>
<P>
   In any criminal trial in the United States, no matter how
serious the crime, a defendant has the right to see all the
evidence against him.
</P>
<P>
   Classified or secret evidence was not even permitted in the
trials of the bombers of the Oklahoma City federal building and New
York City's World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   Use of secret evidence that the accused cannot confront or
dispute is against our nation's sense of justice and our
Constitution. Secret evidence, which cannot be balanced against
counter evidence, perpetuates a sham justice. It denies defendants,
who are the targets of that secret evidence, due process of law.
</P>
<P>
   The Fifth Amendment states unequivocally: ``No person shall be
... deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Notice that the Fifth Amendment does not say ``No United States
citizen shall be ... .'' It says ``No person.'' That means
non-citizens also have the protection of the Fifth Amendment's due
process clause.
</P>
<P>
   But not according to the Immigration and Naturalization Service,
nor according to the anti-terrorism act. That act gave the agency
the power to arrest, detain and deport non-citizens on the basis of
secret evidence. Any non-citizens arrested by the INS can be denied
an opportunity to even confront the government's witnesses against
them or be told who they are.
</P>
<P>
   A few of those arrested non-citizens have spent as long as three
years in prison awaiting the final outcome of their cases. And when
their cases were finally taken out of the special INS courts and
into federal courts through appeals, the INS lost both on the
constitutional issue of denial of due process and on the flimsy
nature of the evidence presented against those accused.
</P>
<P>
   And strangely, although the INS could have appealed these cases
_ involving potential terrorists, according to the agency _ it did
not.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even the agency could see their accusations were based
upon flimsy evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before Congress, both the FBI and the INS claimed
that secret evidence used in all cases is ``substantive and
credible'' and ``is subjected to rigorous review.'' However,
neither the federal courts, nor even some INS special court judges,
who have the right to review the secret evidence, have found that
to be true. Most of this secret evidence turned out to be
inflammatory gossip and hearsay by those who had grudges against
the accused.
</P>
<P>
   Hany Kiareldeen was born in Gaza. He came to the United States
in 1990 to attend college. He was arrested in 1998 and accused of
terrorist activities, based upon a false accusation by his ex-wife.
He spent 19 months in prison before being released. The so-called
evidence against Kiareldeen was his former wife's accusation.
</P>
<P>
   Mazen Al-Najjar, of Palestinian descent, has been in an INS
prison for three years. He taught at the University of South
Florida until he was arrested. He now faces what appears to be an
indefinite sentence. No criminal charges have been made against
him. And Al-Najjar cannot view the evidence against him.
</P>
<P>
   Nasser Ahmed, from Egypt, spent more than three years in an INS
prison, most of it in solitary confinement, before his release last
November when the Board of Immigration Appeals ruled that he did
not pose a threat to national security. The secret evidence against
him was a sham.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., introduced the Secret
Evidence Repeal Act (HR 2121) to end this abomination against the
constitutional rule of law. The legislation now has 90 co-sponsors
in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The act would strike down the use of special courts and secret
evidence against non-citizens. The proposed legislation states in
part: ``The alien shall have reasonable opportunity to examine all
the evidence against the alien, to present evidence on the alien's
own behalf, and to cross-examine all witnesses presented by the
Government.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the House Committee on the Judiciary held hearings on
HR 2121. At that hearing, Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., a co-sponsor
of the bill, made it clear in his testimony that HR 2121 ``would
not require the government to release dangerous terrorists. It
merely requires the government to choose whether to reveal the
evidence against a non-citizen whose liberty is in jeopardy, or
keep that information fully secret and outside immigration
proceedings and determinations.''
</P>
<P>
   David Cole, professor of law at Georgetown University Law
Center, testified before the House Judiciary Committee. He has had
long experience dealing with the INS and secret testimony. He
defended 13 Palestinians against INS charges that they posed a
threat to national security.
</P>
<P>
   Cole said in his testimony: ``But it is not simply years of
human beings' lives that have been lost. More broadly, America's
image as a country that cares about fairness, openness, and due
process has been seriously tarnished. Secret evidence is a tactic
one associates with totalitarian regimes and military juntas, not
free democracies. A remedy is needed, and HR 2121 is it.''
</P>
<P>
   The damage, however, isn't only to our nation's image. The use
of secret evidence poses a significant threat to constitutional
constraints. If the anti-terrorism act can carve out an exception
to the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, what other
exceptions will be carved out during times of perceived danger?
</P>
<P>
   Congress should pass the Secret Evidence Repeal Act.
</P>
<P>
   We cannot protect America by hacking apart our Constitution. If
we attempt to do so, we're in danger of becoming the despotic enemy
we so despise.

TRADE BILL A BITTER PILL _ AND DEMOCRATS BEST SWALLOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there is a dilemma for organized labor in this fall's
election, it is this: What to do about the Democrats in Congress
who voted to grant China permanent normal trade relations.
</P>
<P>
   These Democrats, many of whom depend on labor's support, deeply
disappointed and even angered top labor officials, who have been
campaigning vigorously against the China trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 73 Democrats joined with 164 Republicans to give the
China deal _ and its main backer, President Clinton _ a victory
Wednesday. Both parties, as well as labor, expect the bill to
easily pass the Senate next month.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of organized labor, Democrats who voted for the bill
are guilty of selling out to big business, and as a spokesman for
the United Steelworkers of America said, ``Our members won't
forget.''
</P>
<P>
   While AFL-CIO president John Sweeney said members will decide
for themselves what they will do in November, he assured that
``they'll be holding candidates accountable.'' Teamsters president
James Hoffa said his union would reassess its support for
candidates in the November election.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Democrats' probable presidential nominee, Al Gore, has
not escaped the anger of organized labor for supporting the China
trade bill. Although Sweeney stated that Gore will still benefit
from the AFL-CIO's endorsement, the United Auto Workers union said
it may endorse Green Party candidate Ralph Nader over Gore.
</P>
<P>
   If a large number of disappointed union members who opposed the
bill decide to stay home on election day, as Sweeney warned they
might, Democrats and organized labor may lose two more key battles
more important perhaps even than the China trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   One is the Democratic Party's effort, with the early pledge of
help from organized labor, to regain control of Congress. The other
is to elect Gore the next president.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt organized labor has good reason to be angry at
defecting Democrats and Clinton. By waging a vigorous campaign and
lobbying effort for passage, Clinton apparently put his legacy as a
an achiever of monumental trade agreements _ he also engineered
passage of the NAFTA trade bill _ over his loyalty to the union
members who helped elect him.
</P>
<P>
   But if workers decide to punish him by staying away from the
polls on election day, they would only be helping Texas Governor
George W. Bush, the probable Republican nominee, move into the
White House. And a Bush presidency, especially combined with a GOP
majority in the Congress, could spell labor's defeat in a variety
of upcoming legislative battles.
</P>
<P>
   Whether workers withhold backing _ in the form of money or votes
_ from congressional candidates, or actually work against some
candidates, remains to be seen. Sweeney said it would be up to
local unions and rank and file members to decide which to do in
their local congressional contests.
</P>
<P>
   Some union officials, such as Teamster official Mike Mathis,
said he does not think his union will be working for any Democrat
who voted for the trade bill, and ``There may even be places where
we actively go against someone,'' Mathis said.
</P>
<P>
   As Sweeney and other union officials know, Democrats must take
six seats from the Republicans this fall to win control of the
House, adding that ``there have to be six good candidates out there
to achieve majority in the House of Representatives.''
</P>
<P>
   What the nation's union leaders and key Democrats need is a
summit meeting aimed at putting the trade bill vote behind them and
focusing on electing Gore and taking back the House.
</P>
<P>
   They also need to include in this effort President Clinton, who
is still the most popular Democrat and the party's biggest
fund-raiser. Clinton, of course, must do whatever he can to mend
fences with labor and Democrats who opposed the trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   With Democrats, organized labor, and Clinton working together,
they will have a better chance of winning the House. Labor can, as
Sweeney suggests, look to the 2002 elections for candidates who
strongly support its agenda.
</P>
<P>
   But for this election, avenge, not revenge, should be the theme.
Once organized labor retakes the House, and holds on to the White
House, there will no longer be any doubt that it is a force to be
reckoned with _ and listened to.

REWRITING HISTORY IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   BELA CRVKA, Yugoslavia _ If Sabri Popaj could read the current
revisionist writing about NATO's war with Slobodan Milosevic, he
would learn that the war that allowed him to come home to his farm
was a sham.
</P>
<P>
   He would be told that when his two teenage sons, Agon and
Shendet, his only children, and 63 other civilians from this small,
dusty village in Kosovo were massacred by Serb gunmen the day after
NATO began bombing Serbia, it was NATO's fault _ a reasonable
reaction to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's decision to
bomb a sovereign country.
</P>
<P>
   He would read that the war was probably not worth the effort,
that Milosevic didn't deserve the wrath the US air war rained on
him.
</P>
<P>
   As the anniversary of NATO's victory in its 78-day war against
Milosevic approaches, revisionism, second-guessing, and opposition
to the war are all the rage.
</P>
<P>
   Some of it has legitimate underpinnings _ such as a recent
Newsweek magazine cover story that reported that while the Pentagon
initially claimed to have hit 120 tanks, 220 armored personnel
carriers, and 450 artillery pieces, a suppressed US Air Force
report put the true figures at 14, 18, and 20. Thus, the magazine
concluded, it was the morally dubious bombing of civilians and
infrastructure, not the exaggerated decimation of the Yugoslav
Army, that forced Milosevic to capitulate.
</P>
<P>
   But much of what is being offered in hindsight is far less
informed.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, the right-wing press and commentators, which a year
ago led the war-mongering and demonization of Serbs, now routinely
claim the war a failure, using it as evidence that Prime Minister
Tony Blair should be tossed from office.
</P>
<P>
   William Pfaff, the Paris-based syndicated columnist who last
year cheered on the war, recently questioned the basis for military
action. ``Did the ethnic cleansing inside Kosovo really begin
before NATO's attacks started?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Emilio Perez Pujol, a Spanish forensic scientist, complains that
NATO had wildly exaggerated the numbers of civilians murdered by
Serb forces. He said ``as few as 2,500'' civilians were murdered.
(Investigators at the International Criminal Tribunal for the
former Yugoslavia at The Hague believe the final toll will be
closer to 5,000.)
</P>
<P>
   The revisionism is based on a narrow view of history. Some of
the same people who are saying Milosevic did not deserve to be
attacked have loudly defended the arrest and attempted prosecution
of Augusto Pinochet, the Chilean former dictator.
</P>
<P>
   Over 17 years, Pinochet's regime killed about 3,000 people; in
about half that time, Milosevic has started four wars that have
killed a hundred times as many and displaced millions.
</P>
<P>
   Janine di Giovanni, a foreign correspondent for the Times of
London, recalled that a year ago she was sitting in a trench with
members of the Kosovo Liberation Army, and that NATO's mistaken
bombing of them shows how senseless the war was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing what we know now about the KLA's corruption, and the
behavior of the Kosovan Albanians against Serb civilians, the NATO
campaign seems even more senseless,'' Di Giovanni said.
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt that the KLA killed Serb policemen and
civilians in an attempt to goad the Serbs to commit the atrocities
that led to NATO's intervention. The KLA ranks are littered with
gangsters and bigots. But while the postwar killing of Serb
civilians in Kosovo is inexcusable, and even scandalous given that
there are 40,000 international peacekeepers there, it is absurd and
disingenuous to compare it _ as some are now doing _ to what
Milosevic has done over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   There wouldn't be a KLA if Milosevic had not decided that
Kosovo, while 90 percent ethnic Albanian, was not Serbian enough.
Ethnic Albanians were thrown out of government jobs, relegated to
official second-class citizenship. Just as the Irish Republican
Army could not have reestablished itself 30 years ago without the
British government's clumsy and heavy-handed treatment of Roman
Catholics in Northern Ireland, the KLA would never have been born
without government oppression.
</P>
<P>
   Revisionists maintain that NATO not only inflated the number of
military targets it was hitting, but the number of civilians the
Serbs were killing. A look back at an event in the middle of the
war is instructive: It is true that when the NATO spokesman, Jamie
Shea, and US Defense Secretary William S. Cohen announced that some
100,000 young ethnic Albanian men could not be accounted for, they
were implying that some, most, or all of those men could have been
murdered by Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   But while revisionists see what Shea and Cohen said as a
bald-faced lie, it was certainly within the realm of possibility
that the Serbs were indeed rounding up young men and killing them.
For the two years before the war, the Serbs had been routinely
arresting young ethnic Albanians for no reason. Given that track
record _ not to mention the fact that Milosevic had launched three
previous wars, destabilizing the region and flooding Europe with
more than a million refugees _ fears that they had detained (or
worse) the missing men were legitimate. The revisionists are being
disingenuous by not acknowledging that.
</P>
<P>
   The revisionists point to Chechnya, saying that NATO's failure
to do to the Russians what it did to Milosevic is proof that Kosovo
was not a moral war, as President Clinton and other Western leaders
declared, but only bullying.
</P>
<P>
   That reasoning, however, employs a logic that would suggest that
because the police can't arrest all murderers, they should arrest
none. And if the charge is that NATO acted in Kosovo because the
Serbs don't have nuclear weapons and will not act in Chechnya
because the Russians do, so what? What the revisionists call rank
hypocrisy would be judged by others to be political pragmatism.
</P>
<P>
   Those who criticize the Western powers for not moving more
forcefully against Milosevic years earlier, or for trying to
appease rather than coerce him to abide by international standards,
have a strong argument.
</P>
<P>
   What NATO did, however imperfectly, was show anyone who might
want to emulate Milosevic's tactics for crushing dissent that there
could be a heavy price to pay for such cavalier attitudes toward
human rights. Britain did the same when it detained Pinochet for
more than a year before sending him home on humanitarian grounds.
Criticizing such actions on the basis that the West looks the other
way when Russia and China kill their civilians while rooting out
rebels sounds more self-righteous than realistic.
</P>
<P>
   One thing the revisionists are right about is the unacceptable
number of Serb civilians killed by NATO bombs. Most died because
the Pentagon refused to allow American pilots to fly low enough to
avoid mistaking civilian targets for military ones. But to compare
what NATO did to the premeditated murder of civilians is to engage,
with imperfect hindsight, in a dangerous form of moral relativism.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who says the war was a sham ought to explain it to Sabri
Popaj and his village neighbors who still grieve for their dead.
Revisionist history has not changed his view; Popaj remains certain
about who was at fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO didn't kill my sons and my neighbors,'' he said. ``The
Serbs did.''

 UNDATED: ... for a few minutes.' ''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Burnett, who built up to ``Survivor'' as the creator and
producer of ``Eco-Challenge'' on the Discovery Channel, doesn't
believe that his show is harmful to viewers, or that it panders to
voyeurism. Indeed, he views it as ``a crash course in life,'' one
in which viewers can learn which human traits _ cleverness, the
ability to manipulate others,likability, intelligence _ are most
relevant to survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more like a mirror,'' he says. ``What went on on that
island is just like most offices all over America. There are people
trying to get ahead and win. In the office environment, that means
getting promoted and not getting fired. And people are politicking
and there's a little back stabbing and duplicity now and then. And
there's also hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnett planned the show as a sort of microcosm, making sure
that his 16 castaways were from diverse backgrounds. They include a
72-year-old retired Navy SEAL, a 30-year-old neurologist, a
38-year-old truck driver, a 22-year-old student, and a 62-year-old
musician. ``I didn't want 16 survival nuts who run around in the
woods in camouflage paint on weekends,'' he says. ``That would be
completely boring. I was trying to simulate if there was a cruise
ship that went down and a fair smattering of American society got
washed up onshore.''
</P>
<P>
   Burnett also feels that the ``Survivor'' experience was a
positive one for the participants. He says that, more than the
desire for money and celebrity, they joined the production in
search of a Robinson Crusoe-like experience. Exhibitionism took a
back seat to the thirst for adventure.
</P>
<P>
   He says he made sure the 16 were well cared for. Despite a few
sand-flea-bite infections, a stingray incident, and a diet that
often included rat, they were physically unharmed during their
island stay (as was verified by checkups with the show's medical
director every three days). And psychologically, he says, they were
solid coming in and solid upon departure. The casting of the show
included a written psychological exam and a two-hour psychological
evaluation that was geared to predict ``if they are likely to be
able to accept the rejection of being kicked off the island, if
they are violent, or if they have a propensity to hurt others on
the island.'' There was one psychologist on the island, and another
waiting for the castaways upon their return to the States, one by
one. And once the episodes begin airing, ``Survivor'' will provide
follow-up counseling. ``They're all so balanced,'' Burnett says.
``They're getting together for parties to watch the damn thing.
Even the first people voted out are laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   Fallout
</P>
<P>
   But the psychological effects of ``Survivor'' were called into
question a few weeks ago, when one of the finalists was arrested on
second-degree child-abuse charges shortly after his return from the
island. Richard Hatch, a 38-year-old management consultant from
Newport, Rhode Island, was accused of bullying his 9-year-old
adopted son during an early-morning jog because the boy had gained
approximately 20 pounds during Hatch's absence. For some, the
incident recalled the demise of ``Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire?'' a show that was tainted by the assault
accusations that trailed Rick Rockwell, the groom Fox had chosen
for the show.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett says he feels Hatch is being wrongly accused by the boy,
and that ``Survivor'' is not affected by the conflict. ``I really
like Richard,'' Burnett says. ``And most people on the island felt
the same way. He never made a secret that he was a single gay man
who adopted a problem child. And as a West Point graduate, Richard
has a disciplinarian nature to him, and he decided that, as the
eighth family this kid has been in, this kid needed tough love in
some way. He'd regularly taken this kid on these 4:30 a.m. runs
long before he came to the show. I feel very, very sad for the kid.
Richard is probably the best chance for this poor child, who grew
up in a terrible environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Murray, one of ``The Real World'' producers, likewise
says he feels confident about the psychological screening that
precedes the filming of the ``Real World'' seasons. And he always
makes counseling available during the airing of the show, when a
cast member may have a problem with the instant celebrity, or with
the way they have been portrayed in the final edit. As ``EDtv''
conveyed so vividly, making yourself into a TV show can be more
traumatic than you expected. ``We've found that the greatest
resource they have is each other,'' he says. ``Only they can
understand what it's like to have these cameras follow you and have
your life put up for the enjoyment of others.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, MTV would like to distance ``The Real World''
from ``Survivor'' and ``Big Brother,'' and Murray was reticent
about discussing any series but his own. And indeed, next to the
newfangled shows, ``The Real World'' looks like a harmless pioneer.
It offers no cash prizes, for one thing, and it doesn't encourage
competition by requiring the roommates to continually vote against
one another. ``We all love to listen in on other people's
conversations,'' says Murray, ``and here we've made it easy for you
by shooting it all and putting it together into nice little
22-minute stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Crossroads
</P>
<P>
   As ``Survivor'' and ``Big Brother'' marry exhibitionism and
voyeurism to the sort of get-rich-quick, day-tradingesque mania of
``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' they bring American TV to yet
another crossroads. Will we give up more of our privacy and
modesty, and more of others' privacy and modesty, with each passing
season? Will Andy Warhol's prediction that ``In the future everyone
will be famous for 15 minutes'' turn out to be the understatement
of the 20th century?
</P>
<P>
   Will Big Brother, the once-feared icon of oppression, make it
into Entertainment Weekly's Cool Issue?
</P>
<P>
   Burnett scoffs at the thought that a show like ``Survivor''
represents a subtle erosion of our dignity. ``Some writers aren't
maybe so great at their writing jobs and they're looking for the
easy thing to hang their hat on, and not really cerebrally thinking
it through,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to be involved in a crass thing. That, of
course, may mean the ratings (will) suck. It seems like on TV, the
more crass and violent things are, the better the ratings. I think
dramatically it's very good, but I've tried to keep it highbrow.''

   IN THE LAB: A Toast to Stingers, and to Your Health
</P>
<P>
   Two recent studies _ one animal, one vegetable _ reported
progress in turning nature's stings toward healing purposes.
</P>
<P>
   In an article this month in The Journal of General Physiology,
researchers from the State University of New York at Buffalo
described isolating a factor from the venom of a Chilean rose
tarantula that appears to block the action of the chemicals that
determine when the pores in cell membranes open and close. This
action plays a poorly understood role in a number of bodily
functions, including the sense of touch and the regulation of blood
pressure, and it is associated with a number of diseases, among
them congestive heart failure and brain tumors.
</P>
<P>
   In an article published last week in The Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences, researchers from Seoul National
University and Finch University of Health Sciences in Chicago
reported isolating a substance that is able to turn on the same
switch in the brain that is thrown by capsaicin, the ingredient
that makes hot peppers painfully hot.
</P>
<P>
   Products of enzymes that help speed up the burning of fat, they
found, are able to activate the same receptor cell in the brain,
and one of them has the exact same three-dimensional structure,
opening up possibilities of developing a new class of pain
inhibitor, the researchers wrote.
</P>
<P>
   PATTERNS: Viagra and Women: A Frosty Reception
</P>
<P>
   The first controlled study of Viagra's ability to help women
with a broad range of sexual dysfunctions has found that the drug
did no better than a placebo.
</P>
<P>
   Viagra works in men with erectile dysfunction by increasing
blood flow to the erectile tissue, and since its introduction there
has been widespread speculation that the same effect might be of
benefit to women, since researchers have wondered whether
inadequate blood flow to women's erectile tissue plays a role in
some female sexual dysfunctions as well.
</P>
<P>
   In research presented last week at a conference of the American
College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, researchers studied 577
European, Australian and Canadian women.
</P>
<P>
   About half of them had low levels of arousal as their primary
complaint, the problem most comparable to male erectile
dysfunction. The other primary complaints were low levels of
desire, inability to achieve orgasm or painful dryness during
intercourse. The women were randomly assigned to take Viagra or
dummy pills an hour before intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   After patients recorded the effects in logs and questionnaires
over 12 weeks, the researchers, led by Dr. Rosemary Basson of
Vancouver General Hospital, found no statistically significant
difference in their reports. Most women were able to tolerate the
drug, but some reported side effects that included headache,
flushing and nausea.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Basson, a professor in psychiatry and
obstetrics and gynecology, said the findings confirmed ``that
sexual dysfunctions in women are complex,'' more so than in men.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do women tend more than men to suffer from multiple
dysfunctions, Basson said, but ``when women talk about problems
with arousal they are often talking about different things,'' from
genital arousal to ``mental excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   LONGEVITY: Long Live the Umpire! But How Long?
</P>
<P>
   When an umpire collapsed and died behind home plate minutes
after the opening pitch of the 1996 Major League baseball season,
questions were raised about whether the combination of high stress
and relatively low physical fitness associated with the position
posed a health risk. Now a demographic analysis has provided an
answer: no.
</P>
<P>
   In an article published this month in The Physician and Sports
Medicine, researchers from the Upstate Medical Center in Syracuse,
N.Y., and Bloomsburg University in Pennsylvania, the life spans of
195 umpires, born between 1836 and 1945, were compared to
life-expectancy data from actuarial tables. No statistically
significant deviation was found.
</P>
<P>
   The likely explanation, the researchers wrote, is that the job's
stress is offset by other benefits: After all, they noted, the
workday is rarely longer than four hours.
</P>
<P>
   OUTCOMES: A Simple Plan for Heart Attack Care
</P>
<P>
   A new study has found that giving heart attack victims just
chest compression is as effective as combining compression with
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, leading the researchers to suggest
that the simpler method should be made the standard.
</P>
<P>
   The study, from the University of Washington in Seattle,
involved 241 people who collapsed outside a hospital. If the person
who called 911 did not know cardiopulmonary resuscitation
technique, which alternates the two methods, emergency dispatchers
randomly instructed them in using chest compression alone or full
CPR.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers followed the patients' progress and found no
statistically significant difference in survival rates between the
two groups. The body's bloodstream usually contains enough oxygen
to keep the brain alive until an ambulance arrives, if the blood is
``pumped'' by chest compression, the researchers explained.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Al Hallstrom, the lead author, wrote that given the lack of
a clear benefit from resuscitation, chest compression alone could
be the better method.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it takes an average of 2.4 minutes for an
emergency services dispatcher to instruct a bystander in the full
cardiopulmonary resuscitation technique, time that would be better
spent keeping the blood flowing. For another, some people shy away
from mouth-to-mouth resuscitation out of fear of infection.
</P>
<P>
   Hallstrom noted that the results of the study, which appeared
last week in The New England Journal of Medicine, could be skewed
by the unusually short response times of emergency personnel in
Seattle; after a few minutes, the blood's oxygen is exhausted if
not replenished.
</P>
<P>
   STAGES: On the Trail of Sleepy Sixth-Graders
</P>
<P>
   Every child knows that when you get older you can stay up later.
Now a study from Israel has confirmed what many parents know:
Children get sleepier as they get older.
</P>
<P>
   The study, reported last week in the journal Developmental
Psychology, used motion monitors worn on the wrist to track the
sleeping patterns of 140 second and sixth graders. The children and
their parents filled in logs and questionnaires on levels of
fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that the sixth graders, on average, went
to bed an hour later than the second graders, and got eight hours
sleep, on average, instead of nine. They also reported much greater
morning drowsiness. The study also found that later bedtimes were
more likely in families with older parents and in families that
reported higher levels of stress.
</P>
<P>
   The paper's lead author, Dr. Avi Sadeh, a psychologist at Tel
Aviv University, says there is no simple rule for parents to follow
about how much sleep is enough _ other than being aware of whether
the child is sleepy.
</P>
<P>
   The key to judging whether a child is sleeping enough is daytime
functioning, Sadeh said. ``If the child is alert during the day and
doesn't suffer from daytime sleepiness, irritability, severe mood
disturbances of attention problems, then he or she probably gets
enough sleep.''

   As Darva Conger makes her journey up the celebrity ladder, from
the Woman Who Wanted to Marry a Multimillionaire to teary fixture
on ``Entertainment Tonight'' to Playboy model, the infinitely
resourceful medium of television is about to provide us with a
whole new population of Darvas.
</P>
<P>
   Because Darva, the woman who is famous for exchanging wedding
vows before a nation of TV viewers, is the way of the future. Darva
and Big Brother, that all-seeing dude with the fancy cameras _ they
are the twin rising stars in American culture, the duo poised to
change the face of TV or destroy civilization as we know it,
depending on whom you ask. Together, the forces of Darva and Big
Brother are preparing to turn prime-time TV into a place where
striptease and spying and eavesdropping are little more than
escapist fluff.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, two controversial new CBS series will serve up a
potent mix that is already one of the defining elements of the
Internet. Both high-profile network shows, they will give what is
known as ``reality programming'' _ a genre usually identified with
extreme fodder like ``When Animals Attack!'' _ its most legitimate
entree into the mainstream so far. Called ``Sur-
</P>
<P>
   vivor'' and, yes, ``Big Brother,'' they feature real people
willingly giving up weeks of privacy to be filmed constantly for TV
viewers, who are more than happy to watch. There may not be any
teeth-baring on the new reality shows, but backbiting and
blackballing will certainly be on the menu.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor,'' a 13-week series that premieres on Wednesday,
spies on 16 people who have been left to their own devices on a
remote tropical island off the coast of Borneo. Every three days at
a ``tribal council,'' one of them is voted off the island, until
the last remaining person wins$1 million. (When two are left, the
last seven kicked off the island vote for the winner.) It's
``Gilligan's Island'' meets ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' meets
``Lord of the Flies,'' with an emphasis on the primitive behavior
of the novel. The show's producer, Mark Burnett, says that while
``Survivor'' has the trappings of a game show, it is ``mostly a
psychological story.'' He says he thinks of the ``Survivor'' genre
as ``dramality'' because it's ``drama meets reality'' (and not, of
course, because of the pun on ``malady''). Like ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire,'' ``Survivor'' was originated by a British company.
</P>
<P>
   The provocatively titled ``Big Brother'' promises to be more
incendiary than ``Survivor.''Due in July, the series confines 10
people in a
</P>
<P>
   REAL, Page P6 &QL; 
house for 100 days of 24/7 surveillance, with viewers and roommates
voting every two weeks on which member gets kicked out. The last
remaining person wins a cash prize of $500,000. It's ``The Real
World'' meets ``Millionaire'' meets ``1984,'' and it's the closest
TV has ever come to mimicking the Internet's Web-cam phenomenon,
whereby a person airs his or her own mundane home life on a public
Web site. Already a hit in the Netherlands, ``Big Brother'' was
developed by a European company named Endemol. If it succeeds here,
Endemol may import another of its far-out reality products,
``Chains of Love,'' which literally chains four men to one woman at
the wrists and ankles. Each day, she cuts one of them loose, with
the last remaining man winning a date and a cash prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor'' and ``Big Brother'' join a TV lineup whose fringes
are already peppered with the ``dramality'' genre. ``The Real
World,'' which returns for its ninth season on June 13 in New
Orleans, is a longstanding ratings favorite on MTV. About seven
young people living together as roommates, it is a snappily edited
youth-market fishbowl. UPN's ``Blind Date'' follows young couples
through the awkward minutes of the title event, embellishing the
developments with humorous thought balloons. It's the contemporary
iteration of ``The Dating Game.'' And ABC's ``Making the Band,''
from the producers of ``The Real World,'' chronicles the daily
lives of a group of young men competing and training to be part of
a boy band. After breaking for a few weeks, the series returned to
ABC's lineup last Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Real nightmare?
</P>
<P>
   To some, the reality trend promises to take our culture in an
undesirable and even frightening direction. When he programmed
``Survivor'' and ``Big Brother,'' CBS Entertainment president Les
Moonves acknowledged, ``There are a lot of people (at CBS) who
think we should not be doing this. But I think it could be
interesting.'' The dangers awaiting a TV-addicted country when it
plays with real lives were most recently underscored in the movies
``The Truman Show'' and the underrated ``EDtv,'' which captured
both the allure and then the horror of giving up your privacy to
the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're already a celebrity-obsessed society,'' says Stuart
Fischoff, professor of media psychology at California State
University, Los Angeles. ``Now what were doing is taking people's
normal lives, or even artificially normal lives, and making that
another reason to sit there and be a voyeur. It increases the
passivity of our culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Fischoff says the trend is destined to find increasingly lower
lows, in order to keep viewers interested. ``People become bored
and so you have to escalate the stakes to get them back. At that
point you have high-risk enterprises where people run the risk of
dying, or you have public executions, or you have snuff movies _
anything that will keep the audience interested and spike the
ratings, even if it's another nail in the coffin of civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   Fischoff also says that these reality shows, along with the
popularity of Web cams, make us eerily comfortable with the
phenomenon of surveillance. ``Everybody is getting used to having
the public and the private line obliterated _ my life is for
viewing and if you're interested, great.''
</P>
<P>
   Some cities already have cameras directed at problematic traffic
areas, he says, and this ``sets the stage for a worst-case scenario
in which a tyrannical government keeps tabs on everybody.''
Fischoff says the process is an insidious one, more Aldous Huxley
than George Orwell. ``Orwell foretold that we would be enslaved by
forces that we fear. Huxley predicted that we'd be enslaved by
forces that we love, and I think that's what you have here. We
become so enamored of seeing ourselves or other people on
television that our sensibilities begin to flag, and we say, `Hey,
what can I do to become a celebrity for a few minutes?' ''

 &HT;    Are the good old days gone?
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ The closest I ever came to knowing the joy of
living in a small town, before I moved to this one, was the
neighborhood I grew up in. It was neither a suburb nor a planned
community. It was a tree-lined street of
</P>
<P>
   modest homes and an endless variety of folks living on it. At
the corner we had Bader's Pharmacy, a bakery, a small grocery
store, and Hodap's Butcher Shop _ not because of some municipal
visionary's blueprint, but because they were needed.
</P>
<P>
   We also had a neighborhood post office. I remember it because
the man behind the counter helped me with my first official
purchase _ one stamp to go on the envelope of a letter I had
written to my Aunt Edna thanking her for the box of fancy bath
soaps she had sent for my birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Then we moved and I lost that happy neighborhood _ the one where
I'd known which yard had the best sour cherry tree or the sweetest
Concord grape vine, and who would let me pick and who wouldn't. Now
the nearest post office was a bus ride away and nobody there knew
my name.
</P>
<P>
   And that's how it was before I moved to this village almost 17
years ago. After my first visit, Postmaster Reed was greeting me by
name: ``Morning, Elizabeth,'' he'd smile and ask what he could do
for me.
</P>
<P>
   The folks in the blue shirts and I have done a lot of business
together and they've been mighty good about it. Letters vaguely
addressed: To The Newspaper Writer, Gibsonburg, Ohio, make their
way to my mail basket without any fuss, since of the 2,000 souls in
our village, I'm the only one who gets her name in the paper
without dying.
</P>
<P>
   Then a couple of years ago, Mr. Reed retired and a stranger rode
into town to take his place. The new man doesn't know our names and
sometimes I'm not even sure he likes us. Or maybe it's just our
post office he doesn't like; it's not very big. He's polite, in a
smarmy sort of way, but I suspect he thinks we're all a little
stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other morning when I shambled in with a tissue-wrapped
dress under my arm to send to a friend for her yard sale. I picked
up a large mailing envelope from the rack in the lobby and, since I
was the only customer in the
</P>
<P>
   place, laid the envelope and dress on the counter and busied
myself stuffing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That'll be $1.25,'' the voice said. I looked up. ``For the
envelope,'' he said and pointed. I stooped to pick up the belt I'd
dropped and explained that I didn't want just the envelope _ that I
intended to mail it as well. ``It's still
</P>
<P>
   $1.25 - now.''
</P>
<P>
   I stood up, blinked, and said I'd have it ready to go in just a
few seconds and then I could pay for the envelope and the postage
at the same time. ``Can't do that,'' he said. ``You have to pay for
the envelope now, and then you pay the
</P>
<P>
   postage.'' I was shocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you suggesting I might be intending to steal your
envelope?'' I asked in disbelief. He assured me that was the case _
that it had happened a couple of times. I didn't ask where.
</P>
<P>
   But you know me, I wanted to say. You've seen me in here a
hundred times and you know where I live. Why are you acting like
I'm a fugitive from one of the posters on your ``Wanted'' wall. I
wanted to say that, but I didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I walked next door to the library. ``Hi, Elizabeth,''
Naomi greeted me from behind the counter. ``The books you've
ordered are in.'' I thanked her and said I'd like to browse the
stacks a bit before I checked out. ``Just let me
</P>
<P>
   know when you're ready,'' she said, turning to busy herself
elsewhere and not even asking for my watch as collateral. Guess she
hasn't heard about my attempted envelope heist yet.
</P>
<P>
   I'm still annoyed with the postmaster, but I wish him well. So
well, in fact, that I hope he soon might be promoted to a really
big post office _ one littered with hard-core envelope thieves
trying to mail dresses.

BOURGEOIS BOHEMIANS SET THE TONE

   BOBOS IN PARADISE &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; The New Upper Class and How They Got There &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR; By David Brooks. Simon &AMP; Schuster. 256 pp. $25. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   David Brooks has written a smart, funny book about the new
meritocracy, the information-age elite whose members _ he calls
them Bobos, short for bourgeois bohemians _ set the tone of our
time.
</P>
<P>
   The word Bobo may bring to mind ``bozo,'' or ``boob,'' or
``bimbo,'' but Brooks's coinage is not meant to be negative, not
entirely at least. To some observers, Bobos may appear to be a lot
of latte-swilling, SUV-wielding, fitness-obsessed, self-centered
overachievers. Brooks, a senior editor at The Weekly Standard, a
conservative magazine, sees them differently. He's a Bobo himself.
While his tone is self-mocking and often critical, it is not really
disapproving. He writes incisively, and hilariously, about Bobo
follies, excesses, and self-indulgences, but he believes Bobos
essentially are an impressive bunch who have the potential to be a
positive force.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks uses the wedding page of The New York Times to good
effect to show how The Bobocracy has supplanted the old WASP (and
WASP-ish) establishment. He compares the lineup of the late 1950s,
when pedigree prevailed, to today's, replete with ``Resume Gods''
with impressive degrees and ambitious career paths. ``You can
almost feel the force of the mingling SAT scores,'' he writes of
the more recent unions.
</P>
<P>
   And yet these marriages are not all intellect and achievement.
Each week the Times describes a particular wedding in detail, and
almost inevitably the brainy pair are described by friends as
``enchanting paradoxes . . . grounded but berserk, daring yet
traditional, high-flying yet down to earth, disheveled yet elegant,
sensible yet spontaneous.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the Bobo ethos. They've somehow managed to combine
1960s-style counterculture with 1980s-style achievement. ``This is
an elite that has been raised to oppose elites,'' Brooks writes.
``They are affluent yet opposed to materialism. They are by
instinct antiestablishmentarian yet somehow sense they have become
a new establishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobos may be in the minority, but their tastes and attitudes
have a disproportionate impact on American culture. They are
leaders, opinionmakers, trend setters: ``Wherever they have settled
they have made life more enjoyable (for those who can afford it).''
And what about those who can't? You won't find many references to
the poor and struggling classes in the pages of ``Bobos in
Paradise.'' The book covers the Bobo waterfront, from buying habits
to political style to attitudes about sex, but there is very
little, almost nothing, about the Bobo social conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks shines when he's writing about Bobo taste and lifestyle.
He observes that Bobos take a utilitarian view of pleasure that
synthesizes bourgeois self-control and bohemian emancipation. For
example, women may jog in public places wearing next to nothing _
but ``any erotic effect of their near nudity is counteracted by
their expressions of grim determination.''
</P>
<P>
   The word ``serious,'' he writes, is the highest compliment Bobos
use to describe their leisure activities. Bobos cannot simply go on
vacation; they must spend their time off torturing themselves in
ways that will be intellectually and spiritually enhancing,
``hiking on a forced march across some glacier or trekking thorugh
arid deserts along the path that Alexander the Great's soliders
were induced to follow only by threat of death.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bobo fun is serious, Bobo work is more like play, ``an
extended hobby.'' Brooks contends that Bobos are reshaping the
working world by applying the creative energy of bohemianism to
business. The new ideal organization isn't a machine, it's an
ecosysytem. CEOs talk about trying to promote creativity and wax
enthusiastic about the corporate social mission. Bobo moguls
embrace the notion that work isn't about making money, it's about
doing something you love. ``And the weird thing is that when
employees start thinking like artists and activists, they actually
work harder for the company,'' Brooks concludes, without citing any
evidence. (In his introduction, he notes that his book does not
have a lot of statistics. It is more of an extended essay, a work
of what he calls ``comic sociology.'')
</P>
<P>
   Brooks's chapter on Bobo buying habits is sharply observed and
entertaining, and should strike a chord with anyone who has ever
paused at Starbucks or browsed at Pottery Barn or Restoration
Hardware. Brooks writes that the Thorstein Veblen era is over; that
is almost true. Bobos have managed to meld bohemian disdain for
material objects with bourgeois conspicuous consumption. This means
that marketers must invent ways of selling to people who dislike
marketing. The results may be seen in pre-distressed furniture and
clothing in Bruise Tones, in ice cream companies with their own
foreign policies, and in catalogs that attempt to sell tweed
jackets with a text that traces the history of tweed back to the
14th century. ``If T. S. Eliot were alive today, and of a mind
to,'' Brooks writes, ``he'd open a chain of home furnishing stores
called Objective Correlatives, and each object in them would be the
physical expression of some metaphysical statement.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a certain autobiographical edge to a chapter on Bobo
intellectual life. Brooks contrasts the intellectuals of the 1950s,
who shunned the marketplace and bourgeois values, with the current
ideal, personified by Henry Louis Gates Jr., Harvard professor and
multimedia star. Today's intellectuals, he writes, see their
careers in terms of market niches. Indeed this book is a good
example of how one Bobo intellectual succeeded in finding his niche
and exploiting it for all it is worth, and it may be worth a lot.
We will probably be talking about Bobos for a long time to come.
</P>
<P>
   Bobos are essentially conservative, Brooks writes, not
necessarily politically conservative, but conservative in the
old-fashioned sense, i.e., prudent, restrained, community-oriented,
``epistomologically sober.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobos have learned from the example of Vietnam and the fall of
European communism that revolutions usually backfire. They believe
that steady reform is best. Their political project, he writes, is
to correct the excesses of the bohemian '60s and the bourgeois '80s
by fusing the best features of both. They seek a Third Way, beyond
left or right. The Clinton administration, he writes, embodies the
Bobo spirit of compromise.
</P>
<P>
   In the final chapter Brooks drops the cheeky tone and expresses
an earnest hope that Bobos will be able to transcend their
narcissism and their cynicism about politics and develop a
public-service ethos. If they can, he writes, fervently, ``they
have the ability to go down in history as the class that led
America into another golden age.''
</P>
<P>
   That seems a little mushy, coming as it does at the very end of
a book as witty and trenchant as this one. But maybe it is not such
a surprising turn: As Brooks observes, beneath the Bobo's
microfleece vest beats the heart of a cautious idealist.

   Invasion of the Ants
</P>
<P>
   In Stanislaw Lem's 1961 science fiction classic ``Solaris,'' a
group of scientists encounters a world covered by a sentient ocean,
a single, giant organism that invades every nook and cranny of the
planet (and, unfortunately for the scientists, every nook and
cranny of their minds).
</P>
<P>
   Nothing quite that creepy is going on in California, but the
state has been overrun by a species of ant that, researchers say,
has essentially formed a single giant colony from San Diego to San
Francisco and beyond. The researchers, from the University of
California at San Diego, discovered a lack of genetic variation in
the insect, the Argentine ant, which has allowed the species to
spread to nooks and crannies up and down the state, particularly in
coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
   Individual ants are so close genetically, the researchers report
in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, that they
consider all their fellows to be close relatives and thus do not
engage in the kind of fierce intercolony death matches that limit
the ants in their native Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   A lack of genetic diversity is normally considered bad for a
population, making it vulnerable to disease, among other problems.
The ants are unusual: Their lack of variation is beneficial,
allowing them to thrive.
</P>
<P>
   The sameness results from the insects' having gone through a
genetic bottleneck _ all of them having descended from a relatively
small group. That makes sense given the ants' history. They are
believed to have entered the United States aboard ships that were
carrying coffee and sugar from Argentina in the 1890s.
</P>
<P>
   Patterns in the Forest
</P>
<P>
   Creamy or chunky? That's a thorny issue among children, and also
among ecologists who study the distribution of trees in tropical
forests. Are forests creamy, with trees of the same species
dispersed randomly, or chunky, with the trees clumped together? As
with peanut butter, each side has strong opinions on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   A new report in Science appears to have settled the question.
Researchers from the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and
other institutions surveyed six forest plots of 60 to 130 acres in
Asia and Central America, noting the location of all trees. They
found that almost all the species, numbering more than 1,700, grew
in clumps.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that the results were the same both for
smaller trees and for those with trunks larger than four inches in
diameter. And at all but one site, rare species were substantially
more clumped than common ones. The highest degree of clumping was
found among crape myrtles in a Thai forest, where 51 of 59
specimens grew within about 20 yards of one another.
</P>
<P>
   The work should help conservationists develop forest reserves
and determine harvest patterns that will sustain, not destroy, a
forest.
</P>
<P>
   Where to Point the Hubble
</P>
<P>
   The Hubble Space Telescope needs some help getting pointed in
the right direction. It's not that its gyroscopes are shot _ they
were just replaced, after all, by a shuttle maintenance crew. No,
the Hubble just needs to be told what to look at, and the public is
invited to make suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   The Hubble Heritage Project, an educational group at the Space
Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, is conducting an online
vote to help select the next object to be observed. Visitors to the
project site (heritage.stsci.edu) can make suggestions until June
6, with the final decision being made by the heritage team. The
observation will be made in August.
</P>
<P>
   The site has guidelines for the kinds of objects that can be
suggested (nothing in the solar system is acceptable for this
project, because of the complexities involved in training the
Hubble on a close moving object), as well as a link to astronomy
education resources for those who do not know the Milky Way from a
Mars bar. Votes to focus the instrument on your neighbor's house
will not be counted.  &QL;

A NICE EXCEPTION TO THE PROLOGUE CANON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBIN W. WINKS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roughly half of all mystery novels these days begin with a
prologue, a writer's device to provide background for a reader and,
to my taste, one of the lazier ways out of the writer's dilemma:
how to grab a reader in the first page with some unexplained action
that will be given meaning only far into the novel, by which time
the reader is hooked. The notion that crime fiction needs a grabber
on Page One is a sign of the times, putting instant gratification
ahead of careful development. Now! I'm glad to have got that off my
chest.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner propound a critical canon, and it is challenged. Dana
Stabenow is a professional whose rise to mastery of both prose and
plot can be traced through her books, and she gives us a prologue
in ``Midnight Come Again'' (St. Martin's Minotaur, $23.95) that
launches her best-ever book. The prologue is set in St. Petersburg
(Russia, not Florida), two years before the main story begins, and
it is a fine piece of writing in itself. We then move to Alaska,
home of Kate Shugak, Stabenow's Aleut Native Alaskan investigator,
who has worked her way into our imaginations in eight previous
encounters. Shugak has virtually disappeared, in mourning for her
murdered lover and her own life, and an important part of the
novel, which functions as a second prologue, details finding her.
This done, she and we are propelled into a fine account of the
linkage between Russia and Alaska, smuggling, and some beautifully
evoked Alaskan landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this exception, my bias against prologues is nicely
supported in two other books this month. K. J. A. Wishnia's ``The
Glass Factory'' (Dutton, $23.95) gives us Filomena Buscarsela,
ex-NYPD officer from Ecuador, who is handed a diagnosis that she
has cancer and, at best, eight months to live. This happens on the
day her 2-year-old daughter shows her own detective talent by
concluding that Fil takes cough syrup in order to make her cough
and, as any bright 2-year-old would, wants to know why her mother
likes coughing. There is a needless prologue that uses seven
sentences to get us to a killing, and some other padding, but
mother and daughter are so appealing, and the case against an
unscrupulous businessman who is polluting great swatches of Long
Island is put together so compellingly, the tale keeps one reading
to its bittersweet end.
</P>
<P>
   Another clumsy prologue draws us into ``Shut Down'' by R. J.
Pineiro (Forge, $24.95), which opens with a killing in Japan, moves
on to a railway accident in Florida and an industrial disaster in
Texas, and then settles down to the interesting business of how
computer programs are sabotaged. From this point on, Pineiro's book
grows in its bid to command the reader's undivided attention, and
in the end proves that Pineiro is now professional enough as a
spinner of high-tech thrillers to give up his need to escape from
the search for a compelling first sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the best writers have long since overcome their
insecurity about how to start. Jane Heller is feisty, funny, and
fully in control in ``Name Dropping'' (St. Martin's Press, $24.95),
perhaps because as a literary agent she has helped so many insecure
writers onto the path to success. Her heroine is Nancy Stern, a
preschool teacher who begins to receive $10,000 American Express
bills and invitations to ambassadorial parties because she learns
(in the skillful equivalent to a prologue) that another Nancy Stern
has moved into her apartment block. The first Nancy's phone
messages entice her into accepting a blind date with a man who
thinks she is the second Nancy, and from here everything proceeds
with amusing complications until the second Nancy is murdered. It's
a great story with much wry comment about how trendy parents
deposit their trophy offspring at nursery school and what they
expect of teaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Harlan Coben also knows how to begin a story without hesitation
marks, and ``Darkest Fear'' (Delacorte, $23.95) is a terrific novel
about a young boy who must have a bone-marrow transplant, the
search for a donor who, having surfaced, has disappeared, and the
efforts of Myron Bolitar, ex-Duke basketball star and now sports
agent, to come to terms with the strong possibility that he is the
father. Bolitar is rather immature, and Coben doesn't trouble
himself about making him very attractive, but Coben's
professionalism is clear from every paragraph in the book.
</P>
<P>
   When one thinks of professionals, one thinks quickly of K. C.
Constantine, whose ``Grievance'' (Mysterious Press, $23.95)
completes the transition from Mario Balzic to Ruggerio ``Rugs''
Carlucci as the top cop of Rocksburg, Pa., as decaying a city as
one could hope not to visit. Constantine has a wonderful ear for
how we speak, and he shows the complex home life of his characters
through the angry, despairing way they talk, while never forgetting
that there is also a killing to be investigated: of J. D. Lyons, a
steel magnate found in the trunk of his Jaguar, the man most
responsible for the steady decline of an already grim steel town,
for whose murder nearly everyone in town must be a suspect. I have
admired Constantine for a long time, not least because he gets
right to it, no prologues or epilogues, and he rides the tiger to
the end. I think this is the best Constantine novel ever.
</P>
<P>
   Robin W. Winks reports from Oxford, where he is teaching for the
year, and is hungry for American-based books and the rhythms of
demotic American speech. He returns to Yale in September, and will
probably long for the interrogative voice of Inspector Morse once
again.

   Tony Tjan, 29, and Kaming Ng, 36, cofounders of Zefer Corp.,
might seem to be cliches _ successful, rich, Internet geniuses. Are
there any other kind?
</P>
<P>
   A person walking into their reception area on the sixth floor of
their office and seeing the purple pool table in front of the
silver desk might think: ``Typical dot

<P>
   .com decor. Too cool to stand. I'm out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many young entrepreneurs, they have rocketed into the
financial stratosphere riding an idea at Internet speed. In just
two years Zefer, a private company, has attracted $102 million in
venture capital and generated more than $18.3 million in revenues
selling Net business strategies to clients. Their motto might be:
Way beyond the Web site. Last week the company announced a $12
million deal with Citizens Bank to expand online services and
internal systems.

Business School student is now 750 employees in six cities.
</P>
<P>
   But who are those guys? Beneath the numbers and behind the
sleek, fast corporate culture that would seem to typify a business
generation, there is always a human being.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents came over with $100,'' says Tjan of the journey his
father and mother made from Indonesia to Newfoundland in the late
1960s. ``They had no notion of what they were getting into _ they
just knew what they were getting out of. They barely had a
language. They landed in Gander in the middle of winter. My mother
cried for two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Tjan's parents were first-generation Chinese in Indonesia, part
of a persecuted minority who found a new life in Canada. His
father, who studied at McGill, is a doctor. Tjan was born in
Montreal and grew up in St. John's, Newfoundland. He came to
Massachusetts to attend Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Ng and his parents left Hong Kong in 1994, also for political
reasons, and settled in Toronto. His father is a choreographer who
studied at the Royal School of Ballet in Hong Kong. His mother was
a dancer who later became a costume designer. Ng majored in
mathematics at the University of Ulster in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who has had contact with some immigrant history has an
appreciation for entrepreneurship,'' says Tjan, who met Ng in 1995
when they worked in the Toronto office of McKinsey &AMP; Co.,
management consultants. Tjan was a consultant. Ng worked in visual
aids. He is now the design honcho at Zefer.
</P>
<P>
   Their immigrant roots sparked their friendship and continues to
shape their passion for their work, allowing them to have what Tjan
calls ``a greater belief in the possibilities. We've seen what a
person has to do to overcome adversity.''
</P>
<P>
   The April stock market dive didn't panic them much. Zefer had
been scheduled to go public but pulled back. They still had their
champagne party, though, celebrating growth instead of an IPO.
</P>
<P>
   They're philosophical. Ng quotes Confucius: ``If you find
something you like to do, you'll never work another day in your
life.'' The days are long, sometimes starting at 6:30 a.m. The
travel is intense. ``When people ask my address, I give them a seat
number on United,'' says Tjan.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not a job. ``If I thought this was a job, I'd be gone
by now,'' says Ng. ``I don't want a job. That's 9 to 5 and boring.
I want a challenge. I do this because I love problem solving. It's
not about pixels on a screen. It's not about color. I love
technology. I want to express the best way to navigate through
information.''
</P>
<P>
   Accumulating wealth is as boring to them as a job. Ng rents a
small apartment in the South End. He loves to cook and play the
guitar. He has no car. Tjan owns a one-bedroom in the Back Bay that
is smaller than his student loft. He drives a Saab. He enjoys good
food and French and California wines. But mostly what he does is
work.
</P>
<P>
   Tjan hopes their footprint in time will be this: ``When people
think of the Net, they will say we were the people with the insight
and smarts to guide them through the space.'' He hopes the world
will think big about information-age ethics and ask: ``What is the
digital soul?''
</P>
<P>
   Is he ever scared? ``Some nights you wake up feeling like you're
building a plane while learning to fly,'' he says. ``Other times
you're a 7-foot-2, 8-year-old kid.''
</P>
<P>
   It probably doesn't get much better than that.

PERSONAL HEALTH: MIGHTY CYBERENGINES SPEW HEALTH MYTHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By JANE E. BRODY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mighty Cyberengines Spew Health Myths
</P>
<P>
   When my sons were in the first grade, a rumor circulated through
New York City elementary schools that cockroaches often
contaminated canned tuna. Though the boys liked other fish,
including sardines, they refused to eat canned tuna in any form and
still avoid it more than 20 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Like alligators living in the sewer, many urban myths assume a
life of their own despite a total lack of supporting evidence. The
alligator myth is more a source of amusement than a problem for
anyone, since very few of us venture into sewers. But when myths
involve health issues, they can result in needless anxiety,
avoidance behavior and inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, these unsubstantiated rumors about health hazards
lurking in our midst spread relatively slowly from person to person
by word of mouth, unless some radio or television program happened
to give them national airing. Now there is a new rapid-fire means
of transmitting misinformation nationwide, even worldwide, via
e-mail and the Internet. And since these communications appear in
writing, rumors about health hazards floating around cyberspace
seem to acquire an undeserved validity that makes them more likely
to be believed than any oral warning.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone is equally gullible. Still, some people
react with fear, even panic, when a cybermyth about health appears
on their computer screens. Several of these ``urban health myths''
are exposed for what little they are worth in the May issue of Mayo
Clinic Women's HealthSource, a newsletter published by the Mayo
Clinic in Rochester, Minn. I have added one of my own, on aluminum,
that predates cyberspace but refuses to die.
</P>
<P>
   MYTH: Cooking in aluminum pots causes Alzheimer's disease. The
sick brain cells of people with Alzheimer's disease have been found
to contain high amounts of aluminum. This prompted people to point
a guilty finger at aluminum pots and pans as a source of this
element that they believe damage brain cells, resulting in
senility. Countless people tossed out all their aluminum cookware,
replacing it with stainless steel and enameled cast iron.
</P>
<P>
   But what those who panicked failed to realize is that sick cells
tend to accumulate toxic metals because they are unable to
eliminate them. Despite numerous investigations, there is no
scientifically reliable evidence that aluminum is the cause, rather
than the result, of a diseased brain.
</P>
<P>
   MYTH: Antiperspirants cause breast cancer. A persistent Internet
myth is that since antiperspirants block sweat glands, those in the
underarm are unable to eliminate toxic substances, sending them
instead into nearby lymph nodes, where they cause genetic mutations
that result in cancer.
</P>
<P>
   First, sweat glands do not eliminate toxins and are not
connected to the lymph system. Rather, toxins are processed through
the liver and kidneys. Second, breast cancer does not arise in
lymph nodes. It may spread to underarm nodes, but it starts within
the breast tissue, usually in milk ducts. Third, there is no
evidence linking breast cancer to not sweating. Fourth, no
ingredient in antiperspirants is known to cause cancer. Finally,
among countless studies of risk factors associated with breast
cancer, not one has pointed to antiperspirants as a remotely
possible cause.
</P>
<P>
   MYTH: Costa Rican bananas carry flesh-eating bacteria. Whenever
a frightening, mysterious illness gains widespread attention, myths
tend to abound as to its source. Hence the myth that touching the
skin of bananas grown in Costa Rica can expose a person to the
bacteria that cause necrotizing fasciitis, a potentially deadly
disease caused by bacteria that attack the flesh in science-fiction
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Necrotizing fasciitis is caused by various bacteria, including
Group A streptococcus that is found on people's skin and in their
throats. It is transmitted from through saliva or mucus or through
sores on the skin to another person who broken skin. The bacteria
cannot infect intact skin. Nor are they carried on bananas.
</P>
<P>
   MYTH: Aspartame causes ... you-name-it. According to the Mayo
Clinic, one woman is the source of the belief that the artificial
sweetener aspartame causes everything from obesity to manic
depression to multiple sclerosis. The woman maintains that the Food
and Drug Administration, in cahoots with commercial interests, has
suppressed evidence of aspartame's risks and that all the studies
indicating its safety are tainted because they have been financed
by the company that produces it.
</P>
<P>
   One study published in 1997 linked aspartame to a rise in brain
tumors. But the increase in these tumors, which began in the 1970s,
predates the introduction of aspartame into the food supply. There
are many factors that might account for the rise in brain tumors,
but none, including the use of cellular phones, has been
established with any degree of scientific certainty.
</P>
<P>
   When aspartame was first introduced, there was a suspected link
to seizures and depression that also has not been substantiated by
further research. And the claimed link to multiple sclerosis has
been disputed by the Multiple Sclerosis Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   In an indirect way, however, aspartame and every other sugar
substitute might be partly to blame for the rise in obesity. While
the sweeteners themselves contribute few or no calories to the
diet, they do help to perpetuate the desire for very sweet foods.
Since 1975, the per capita consumption of sugar and other caloric
sweeteners has sharply increased, by more than 28 pounds a year.
That certainly is no help to America's expanding waistline.
</P>
<P>
   There are any number of other urban health tales now circulating
on the Internet that have been refuted by reliable sources with no
ax to grind, including the government agency most directly
concerned with the public's health, the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention. Among the prevailing myths are that kidneys and
other organs are being stolen from live victims without their
knowledge (the National Kidney Foundation says no way!) and that a
deadly spider dubbed Arachnius gluteus lives under the seats of
public toilets awaiting a sumptuous derriere to bite. A report
attributing the deaths of three women to such a bite was supposedly
published in The Journal of the United Medical Association.
However, as noted by the Mayo newsletter, there is no such spider
and there is no such journal.
</P>
<P>
   The moral of this story is don't be so quick to believe
everything you read on the Net or hear on a broadcast. Check the
source and evidence before you panic.

FREE STOCK TRADES HAVE TRADE-OFFS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT BERNARD NELSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Free stock quotes are everywhere. Costless Internet connections
were news a year ago. And gratis e-mail accounts? They're downright
pedestrian.
</P>
<P>
   It was probably inevitable that somebody would dangle free stock
trades in front of online investors, too.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Boston-based Brown &AMP; Co. slashed commissions to $5 on
some trades back in 1998. Longer ago than that, brokers began
blanketing the Web with offers to buy and sell shares for as little
as $7 or $8 per trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're making almost nothing on each trade as it is,'' said
Robert Sterling, an analyst at Jupiter Communications in New York.
``What's another $5, or even $8?''
</P>
<P>
   It may not mean much to them, but three online brokerages hope
the extra money matters a whole lot to investors.
</P>
<P>
   One, American Express Brokerage, first offered free trades to
high-roller clients in November. Two others introduced a limited
form of no-cost trading this month, both targeting less monied _
and more active _ investors.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, all three services sound great. But free trading
isn't without its detractors.
</P>
<P>
   Unless an investor does a fair amount of trading each month, the
argument goes, $5 just isn't that significant. On a $10,000
buy-and-hold investment, few people will care whether they have to
hand over one more Abe Lincoln to close the deal.
</P>
<P>
   And reduced commissions typically come at a price in other
areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, you have to ask yourself what you need
from (an online) broker,'' said Jaime Punishill, an analyst at
Forrester Research in Cambridge. ``We've found that commissions are
often well down the list of priorities for people.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. But few are going to turn down free trades, as long as
their other priorities are addressed.
</P>
<P>
   That's why you need to take a close look at the tradeoffs each
site forces on you in exchange for zero commissions.
</P>
<P>
   --www.americanexpress.com offers a relatively robust brokerage,
along with a number of other financial services.
</P>
<P>
   There's just one catch: To get free trading, you need to keep a
six-figure account with American Express. (Actually, stock
purchases are commission-free with $25,000 in your account.
Commissionless sales require a $100,000 minimum.)
</P>
<P>
   If your account dips below the threshold, trades are $14.95
each.
</P>
<P>
   ``Presumably, people who qualify for free trading have more
money than the average bear,'' said Dan Burke, an analyst at Gomez
Advisors in Lincoln. ``Free trading for them isn't the deciding
factor in choosing a broker, but it's a little bonus on top.''
</P>
<P>
   American Express spokesman Dave Kanihan agreed, saying investors
attracted to free trades are likely to be interested in the
company's other services, too.
</P>
<P>
   The brokerage is substantial in its own right, though, offering
the ability to trade stocks on all the major exchanges (but not
over the counter), buy and sell 2,000 mutual funds, and trade all
kinds of bonds. It also features online bill payment, and peddles
options, certificates of deposit, and some insurance products.
</P>
<P>
   The site's investment tools include real-time stock quotes and
some charting. And, of course, American Express financial planners
stand ready to give you advice _ for an additional charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty thorough service,'' said Sterling, of Jupiter
Communications. ``You just have to be able to pony up $100,000 to
get the free transactions.''
</P>
<P>
   --www.freetrade.com is at the other end of the Internet-broker
spectrum. The no-frills end.
</P>
<P>
   A subsidiary of Ameritrade, freetrade.com tells investors up
front that the type of trading it offers isn't for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can only survive with special types of accounts and a
special type of operation,'' the site explains. ``Therefore, we can
only service a special type of customer, a customer that will
qualify and agree to our type of operation.''
</P>
<P>
   The service is strictly bare bones and completely electronic,
with no phone support, no research, and no screens full of
real-time trading data.
</P>
<P>
   You can't transfer money from another account to freetrade.com
(wire transfers only, please). You can't open an IRA, or trade
bonds, options, or mutual funds (stocks only, thank you). And you
can't do anything other than simple market orders if you want free
trading (limit orders cost $5 each).
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, freetrade.com differentiates itself from competitors
by cutting back on expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The home page also discloses freetrade.com's sources of revenue:
Advertising, interest from loans to investors, and ``payment for
order flow,'' or the cents per share that stock clearing firms pay
to process your trades (they profit by selling those shares for a
smidgen more than they paid).
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers, though, are skeptical of the site's chances
for long-term survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freetrade is just floating something up there, to see if it
sticks,'' said Burke, of Gomez Advisors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably 10 guys in the world that want this kind of
trading,'' said Punishill, of Forrester Research.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody from freetrade.com or its parent company is defending the
site at this point, either. Ameritrade quietly launched the service
a few weeks ago, and won't comment publicly on it now.
</P>
<P>
   --www.thefinancialcafe.com began taking buy and sell orders less
than two weeks ago, and is the most difficult of the free-trading
sites to peg.
</P>
<P>
   Like freetrade.com, it eliminates commissions on basic market
orders. (Most other stock trades cost $16.95, plus 1 cent per
share. If you have to speak with a live broker, it will cost you
$30.95, plus 1 cent per share.)
</P>
<P>
   Like American Express, thefinancialcafe.com provides a
relatively full slate of brokerage offerings. Mutual funds, bonds,
and options are included, and IRAs are welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Thefinancialcafe.com also offers a split trading screen, which
allows investors to track their stocks on one side and pull up
research on the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we won't make you wire money to us to open an account,''
joked Andrew Koslow, chief operating officer of The Financial
Cafe.com LLC, based in San Francisco. ``A check or a transfer will
do just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The site tries to provide both low-cost trades and high-value
service by partnering with firms such as Morningstar.com and
IPO.com. It gives the firms part ownership in thefinancialcafe.com,
or promises to send business their way in exhange for no-cost or
low-cost tie-ins for brokerage customers.
</P>
<P>
   Koslow said more partnerships are in the works, which will
expand the number and type of services available.
Thefinancialcafe.com also has its own editorial staff, cranking out
investment-related articles for clients.
</P>
<P>
   The information clearly eclipses what's available on
freetrade.com. But it isn't (yet) on par with the offerings at
full-service brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   Punishill said that if he was a typical investor and it was his
money, he'd probably take a wait-and-see attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you're trading dozens of times per month, you won't
spend that much on commissions,'' he said. ``Is that really worth
betting that a new brokerage will stick around, that you won't have
to transfer your account later, or that you'll get bad service or
executions?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get so much more for $8 or $10 a trade, most people
will decide it's not worth it to be an early adopter.''

GORE'S PRESS PREOCCUPATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Here's a classic example of the kind of thing that
drives Al Gore to distraction.
</P>
<P>
   A former reporter, Gore is making the classic politician's goof
in thinking that what appears in print or on the air has any
significant bearing on whether he does or doesn't get elected
president.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two months ago, at the dawn of the current media fad _ to
wit, that having ``surged'' ahead in the polls, George W. Bush is
doing all the right things while the vice president is floundering
_ there was considerable press attention on a respected survey of
registered citizens in Michigan, a critical battleground state.
</P>
<P>
   It showed Bush and Gore tied 42-42 percent, with trends behind
the overall numbers indicating clear movement toward the Texas
governor among major segments of the state's electorate, especially
independents and relatively conservative Democrats who live in the
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Even more press attention then focused on a second Michigan
survey a month later, which showed Bush perhaps moving into the
lead (45-42 percent, or within the survey's error margin) as those
suburb-related demographic trends appeared to gather a little
steam.
</P>
<P>
   From Gore's frustrated perspective, the plaintive question is
why the first set of trends was a big story but the second barely
rated a hiccup, even in Michigan. The first was a key element of
negative assessments of the vice president's campaign; the second
has hardly produced any press comment that it might signal a
turnaround in core Democratic as well as swing voter sentiment
about the two candidates, at least in a state the Democrats have to
carry and the Republicans would dearly love to steal.
</P>
<P>
   The real question, however, is why should Gore give two hoots
what anybody else says outside the people his campaign pays to have
informed opinions.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, from all I can gather, goes to one of the few
important manifestations of Gore's having spent his childhood
school terms living here with his chronically political family in a
hotel. He has this notion _ rather odd among modern politicians _
that what appears in the paper or on the air is worthy of his time
and, worse, his analysis and reaction _ often his rather intense
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is not a complainer, not prone to whine at reporters,
editors, or columnists about what they say or write. Instead, he
tends to react intensely internally _ hence the distraction. His
top people are known, as a result, to have meetings about
particular stories that are in the works. Gore tends to badger top
advisers about particular slights, wasting his and their time in
bull sessions about the mystical rhythms of press coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Among the politicians who have noticed this fixation is
President Clinton, from whom Gore could learn a thing or two. Bill
Clinton is a success in part because he approaches the world of the
media with no illusions or expectations. For example, he learned
during the impeachment ordeal that ``all Monica, all the time'' had
absolutely nothing to do with public opinion as it unfolded over
the long year.
</P>
<P>
   Governor George W. Bush of Texas is similarly unencumbered by
press concerns and illusions. His roller coaster ride so far
provides all the evidence he needs. All the adoring initial press
exposure a candidate could want last summer and fall had no impact
on John McCain's ability to gain traction with voters and come
fairly close to upsetting him.
</P>
<P>
   And all the negative press that Bush got as the campaign heated
up from just before the New Hampshire primary through Super Tuesday
had absolutely nothing to do with his ability to beat back McCain's
challenge. From his personal life to his mental acuity to his
chances of victory, the governor evinces a healthy ``whatever will
be will be'' attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Not so the only former reporter in the race. His latest reaction
_ to a Washington Post editorial taking a neutral position on
Bush's latest attempt to fill in some of the huge gaps that remain
in his position on defense _ produced a flurry of activity
reflecting Gore's frustration but accomplishing nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   What is odd about Gore's press preoccupation is that as a
candidate he tends to stiff the reporters covering him, though his
accessibility has improved lately. It's as if he has the discipline
to ration access but not to control his fixation on how he is
covered.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that the tenor of press coverage and commentary has
very little to do with how a candidate fares in presidential
politics. Research primarily shows that what media groupies call
``buzz'' may have commercial value, but the increasing focus on
style and horse race aspects of politics has caused most people to
take press coverage more as infotainment than as information.
</P>
<P>
   The sooner Gore realizes this, the better he'll do on the trail.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Yellowing Paper
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why does paper, especially newsprint, turn yellow as it ages?
</P>
<P>
   A. The paper is oxidizing, one of several destructive processes
that affect paper. Newsprint is high in lignin, one of the main
structural components of wood. When lignin is in contact with
oxygen, a highly reactive chemical, the reaction changes the way
the fibers reflect light, discoloring the paper. Oxidation also
produces more acid, a major culprit in the breakdown of many modern
papers.
</P>
<P>
   Older paper was usually made from linen or cotton fibers, which
required little treatment to offer a good writing surface. Wood is
much cheaper, but manufacturers found they had to use a thin
chemical layer called sizing on the paper surface to make it less
absorbent and prevent blurring when ink is applied.
</P>
<P>
   A commonly used sizing is a compound of alum, or aluminum
sulfate, and when exposed to warmth and high humidity, alum
molecules split up and form an acidic solution. Cellulose fibers,
which are made of molecular chains of carbon atoms, are easily
split by even weak acids. The strength of the fibers is destroyed,
and the paper becomes fragile.
</P>
<P>
   The acid problem affects nearly half the books published since
1850, conservators estimate, and it was not until the 1950s that
publishers began to abandon alum sizing for alternatives to make
some paper acid-free. Conservators are also working on treatments
to de-acidify paper.

&HT;     THE ABORTION BLUES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By coming out forcefully in support of the
Republicans' current anti-abortion plank, Texas Gov. George W. Bush
may have avoided another bitter abortion fight at the party's
convention in July.
</P>
<P>
   He stressed his capitulation to the GOP's far right during a
joint appearance with Gen. Colin Powell, who is widely admired and
mentioned as a possible secretary of state but who would like to
remove the plank. This means that moderates who had hoped for a
more tolerant convention position on abortion might as well give up
now. Bush will control the convention, and what he wants he will
get.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican platform is a grass-roots document, and I think
the plank ought to stay the way it is,'' Bush said last week. The
comment reflects the retreat he has been making from his previous,
more woman-friendly stand.
</P>
<P>
   Before his primary scare in the South Carolina primary and his
embrace of the Christian right, Bush used to say that while he
supported an anti-abortion constitutional amendment, he favored
exceptions for the life of the mother and in cases of rape and
incest.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 GOP platform endorses ``a human life amendment to the
Constitution'' and ``legislation to make clear that the Fourteen
Amendment protections apply to unborn children.'' It does not
mention any exception. The language treats a fetus in a womb as a
person entitled to equal protection of the laws with rights that
are identical to those of a living, breathing, pregnant woman.
</P>
<P>
   The plank also supports ``the appointment of judges who respect
traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human
life,'' which is the GOP code for a fetus. Bush has never been
clear about how he views this section of the anti-abortion plank,
but in his remarks last week he did not back away from it.
</P>
<P>
   He insists that he will not apply an anti-abortion litmus test
to his Supreme Court and other judicial appointments, as the plank
demands. But he coyly declares that he wants to name ``strict
constructionists'' and lists Supreme Court Justice Anthony Scalia,
who strongly favors overturning the Roe v. Wade decision, which
legalized abortion, as the jurist he most respects.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party platform was pro-choice until 1980, when
the nominee, Ronald Reagan, insisted on reversing that position.
Since then, anti-abortion activists within the GOP have grown
steadily more demanding, kicking up a fuss when subsequent nominees
George Bush, the governor's father, and Sen. Bob Dole tried to
reach out to pro-choice Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 President Bush talked about making the party ``a big
tent'' encompassing all views on the subject. He personally
supported an exception for the life of the prospective mother. But
his words turned out to be hollow. He couldn't overcome pressure
from the religious right. Outnumbered and intimidated, moderates
abandoned their threats of a floor fight in the interests of party
unity. The platform remained intolerant and the tent tiny.
</P>
<P>
   Again in 1996, Dole, needing desperately to appeal to
independents and moderates, tried to soften the offending GOP
plank. Polls show that most voters want abortion to be limited but
do not want it outlawed.
</P>
<P>
   Dole wanted to include a mild reference to abortion as a matter
of ``personal conscience.'' But his modifying language was
immediately rejected by abortion opponents, and he too gave up in
order to avoid a bitter internal party fight.
</P>
<P>
   The best Dole could do was to say that he had not read the
platform and to indicate that he would ignore it because nobody
paid any attention to it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Dole was right in a sense. Party platforms are instruments of
interest mostly to political wonks. But the documents do set forth
the political philosophy of a party and as such can be a useful
guide to the direction a newly elected president might take.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has ample reason to work for a peaceful convention that
buries the divisions within his party. A nominee who presides over
an unruly pack of delegates does not inspire confidence in his
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Given that reality, it is unlikely that Bush will have the
courage to select a running mate who is pro-choice although he is
trying to win over moderates by pretending to consider one. The
religious right objects as strongly to that heresy as to changing
the abortion plank.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives have signed onto the Bush campaign mostly as the
lesser of two evils. Many of them are willing to live with his
low-key approach to abortion (he seldom mentions it) so long as
they know he is really in their corner.
</P>
<P>
   Picking a pro-choice vice president would confuse and anger
them. It would also be inconsistent with the unambiguous signals of
unwavering opposition to a woman's right to choose that he is now
sending.

THE JOURNALIST AND THE SERIAL KILLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN YEMMA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a bright spring morning not long ago, two state troopers
showed up unannounced in the lobby of my office. One was tall, one
was short. Both were wearing windbreakers. They wanted to talk to
me and ushered me over to a side area. Immediately, I raced through
recent memories to see if there was something I did, someone I knew
. . . but I came up empty. I live a quiet life _ work, home, a
little excessive speed in between, maybe, but nothing more daring
than that. I have no ongoing feuds, no felonious friends.
</P>
<P>
   In 25 years as a journalist, I've talked with law enforcement
officials many times. Usually, it's a situation involving someone
whose life has just been intruded upon by violence, craziness,
turmoil. Usually, I'm asking the questions, weighing the answers
for that elusive quality, truth. Not this time.
</P>
<P>
   John Kelly, one of the troopers, pulled a file folder out of his
briefcase and showed me a four-page letter he had received, via
Interpol, from a police department in Scotland. Keeping his voice
low so as not to be overheard by my co-workers strolling past,
Kelly explained that a slip of paper with my name on it had been
found when police raided the apartment of a suspected serial killer
in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that moment. Imagine it in slow motion: s-e-r-i-a-l
k-i-l-l-e-r.
</P>
<P>
   The man's name is William Ian Beggs. The crime for which the
36-year-old Beggs had been arrested was the killing and
dismemberment of an 18-year-old grocery store worker. Parts of the
young man's body were found in Loch Lomond. The cavalier Scottish
tabloids have reduced this awful crime to a sound bite called the
``limbs in the loch case.''
</P>
<P>
   Scottish authorities wanted, first, to confirm my ``safety and
well-being.'' That being clear, Kelly then showed me three pictures
of Beggs taken over a 10-year-period, progressively more fleshy
through the decade. Had I ever seen him? I have a good memory for
faces. And I have done a lot of traveling in my career. He didn't
register as anyone I had met.
</P>
<P>
   There's one other thing, and saying this will be a little
awkward: Beggs preyed mainly on men, most of them gay.
</P>
<P>
   I am not gay. I don't lead a secret life, either. But a possible
Jeffrey Dahmer-type serial killer had my name. How? Why? I've never
even been to Scotland. It's been five years since I've traveled
abroad. Could Beggs have come to the United States?
</P>
<P>
   I puzzled over it. There are two other John Yemmas in the world
that Internet searches have turned up, but the actual information
that police pulled from Beggs's apartment was linked to me:
``Boston Globe 00-1-617-929-2000. John Yemma. PO 2378 Boston
02107.'' I can never remember the post office box number, so the
fact that he had it (it's on my cards) was a clue of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   I thought back to a talk I had given during a fellowship at
Oxford University in 1994 and to a conference I had attended in
Belfast that same year. Could I have run into him at either of
those places? There are always mysterious faces on the edges of
crowds. Some background research indicated that at one time Beggs,
who hails from County Down, was active in Ulster Unionist circles.
Could he have been in an office when I handed out a business card?
There is always a low-level functionary in a back room compiling a
list of journalists for bureaucratic purposes.
</P>
<P>
   So was he stalking me? On calling the police department in
Strathclyde, the city where Beggs's last victim lived, I was told
by a sympathetic policewoman that while my name was found on a
scrap of paper, many other names were found on other scraps of
paper and in address books throughout Beggs's litter-strewn
apartment. There was no clue to his intentions with those names,
but police are investigating a string of disappearances. Neighbors
spoke of screams and sawing sounds coming from his apartment at
various times.
</P>
<P>
   Beggs, I learned, was a computer specialist at a local
university. Could that be how he got my name and the Globe's post
office box? Possibly, said policewoman Kate Jackson: ``We're seeing
more and more of that sort of thing with the Internet.'' But the
Internet is such a forest of names and information. Why pick a
minor character like me?
</P>
<P>
   Or could someone who knew me have been using my identity to mask
his own as he cruised the gay bars of Scotland? That could be the
case as well, Jackson agreed. Five years ago, my wife found that an
acquaintance had appropriated her name and was using it on an
Internet chat room, having cooked up a story about being a
paraplegic who was consulting with my wife, a psychiatrist. The
acquaintance is able-bodied. My wife is an illustrator.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe someone did the same with my name. Trooper Kelly told me
this happens more often than you might think. Or maybe some third
party just dropped the name while talking with Beggs in a dark bar
somewhere. But it just as well could have been in broad daylight in
a perfectly innocent setting. Even a serial killer must have a
normal side, must sometimes sit in the next seat on an airplane,
buy a cup of coffee at the same counter as you, show an interest in
activities other than murder and dismemberment.
</P>
<P>
   I'll probably never know. Jackson assured me I have nothing to
worry about. I have signed a sworn statement saying that to the
best of my recollection I've never met or seen Beggs and know no
one who has. If this creep, currently jailed in Amsterdam, has a
string of crimes to his name, that is where the tragedies lie, that
is where investigative energy should be spent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's a lesson for me: Over the years I have had the
unpleasant task of talking with people whose private lives, because
of some event _ a war, an accident, a controversy _ have been
penetrated by the merciless public gaze. I've met some of you when
you were at your most vulnerable, when your good name, your very
identity, was under suspicion, when you worried about the
skepticism with which your story was greeted _ worried that you
were somehow guilty because you were inadvertently connected. I've
always imagined it was awkward for you. I've never known how
awkward until now.

REMEMBERING A CRUSADER   AGAINST POVERTY

   THE OTHER AMERICAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Life of Michael Harrington &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Maurice Isserman. PublicAffairs. &UR;  &LR; 449 pp. Illustrated.
$28.50. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the most influential American books of the last 50 years
was ``The Other America'' by Michael Harrington, subtitled
``Poverty in America'' and first published in 1962. Not only did
this eloquently compressed book (it ran fewer than 200 pages)
influence public policy, beginning in the Kennedy administration
and continuing with the Johnson administration's War on Poverty,
but it inspired tens of thousands of young Americans to join VISTA
or the Peace Corps and try to change the world Harrington had raged
against.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington died almost 11 years ago, and a full-scale biography
is most welcome. In Maurice Isserman, he has found an admiring, but
critical, biographer. It is a tribute to his skill that Isserman, a
leading historian of the American left and a history professor at
Hamilton College, is as understanding of Harrington's ``discovery''
of poverty in the Catholic Worker movement as he is of Harrington's
efforts to find a solution through socialism.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington (born Edward, in 1928) came out of a comfortable
middle-class, Roman Catholic background in St. Louis and went to
Holy Cross. There followed a year at Yale Law School, then one at
the University of Chicago to pursue poetic yearnings.
</P>
<P>
   Returning home, having recast himself as ``Michael,'' his middle
name, he landed a job as a welfare worker for the St. Louis public
schools. Brief though his stay was, he still recalled years later
the day he visited a derelict tenement. ``The cooking smells and
the stench from the broken, stopped-up toilets and the murmurous
cranky sound of the people were a revelation. It was my moment on
the road to Damascus, (and riding home) I realized that somehow I
must spend the rest of my life trying to obliterate that kind of
house and to work with the people who lived there.'' Isserman takes
Harrington's memory at face value, perhaps because such
impulsiveness was so very much in his character.
</P>
<P>
   At the Catholic Worker, Isserman writes, Harrington was more of
a scholar than a ``mercy-giver.'' He ``did not often serve food on
the bread line, and when he did, it was not with any great sense of
fulfillment.''
</P>
<P>
   But there Harrington fell under the spell of the saintly _ and
autocratic _ Dorothy Day. He would remember years later that it was
considered a ``perfectly rational and legitimate thing'' to say
that one was there because they wanted ``to be a saint.'' For her
part, Isserman writes, ``Day appreciated the intellectual luster''
that Harrington brought to the Catholic Worker's penny-a-copy
newspaper and ``also appreciated the social graces'' _ opening the
door and pulling out the chair for her _ he brought to scruffy St.
Joseph's House.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, it is Day, not any of his socialist allies
and enemies of later years, whose inspiration Harrington
acknowledges in ``The Other America.'' Through her and the Catholic
Worker movement, he wrote, ``I first came in contact with the
terrible reality of involuntary poverty and the magnificent ideal
of voluntary poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington left the Catholic Worker _ and the Roman Catholic
Church _ after a year, reassuring the straight-laced Day that it
was because of ideology, not a woman. The ideology was socialism
and Harrington spent _ perhaps ``squandered'' is the appropriate
word _ many ensuing years fighting one factional battle after
another. Isserman chronicles this in some detail, but recognizes
that it all pales against the signal accomplishment of ``The Other
America.''
</P>
<P>
   The book grew out of two articles Harrington wrote for
Commentary magazine. The timing, Isserman writes, ``was remarkably
good,'' the second appearing after US Senator John F. Kennedy,
campaigning in West Virginia for the 1960 Democratic presidential
nomination, had exposed the region's desperate poverty.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Harrington who became known as ``the man who
discovered poverty.'' As Isserman writes, Harrington wanted his
readers to understand ``that despite the apparent national
consensus about the arrival of the `affluent society,' widespread
poverty continued to exist'' in an ``invisible land'' of rural
isolation or urban slums. Beyond that, poverty was not just a lack
of income but a distinct culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The creative achievement,'' writes Isserman, was to present
these findings in a tone that was ``modest, reasonable and calm,
and . . . at the same time idealistic, impassioned, and
inspiring.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington spent his final years in efforts to promote a
socialist ideology within the Democratic Party. He died, in July
1989, of cancer, still hopeful _ even against the evidence that
that ``other America'' of poverty had not been vanquished _ that
``there are signs that we are, without really having planned it
that way, marching out of the desert.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Other America'' is still in print (though not with the
ironic red-white-and-blue cover of the paperback that once tumbled
out of activists' backpacks). It is still powerful in the
rereading. It might even hold the power to influence the children
of those thousands who read it while at their long-ago
poverty-program postings in Harlem or Appalachia.

A WEEDY SEA DRAGON PLAYS A STARRING ROLE AS `MR. MOM' 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By RACHEL USLAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Normally, it is the most popular exhibit at the Long Beach
Aquarium of the Pacific, but lately, the weedy and leafy sea dragon
tank is surrounded by more expectation than the usual school-age
visitors provide. One of the weedy males is pregnant, with about
100 bright pink eggs hanging prominently onto his tail. That 8-inch
creature is an international star.
</P>
<P>
   What has the aquarium world watching so closely is not that the
mother is a male. Sea dragons are actually among one or two fish
groups whose males incubate the eggs. Rather it is the hope that
this notably sensitive species might actually reproduce away from
its natural habitat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Mom,'' as he is called, is the first captive weedy sea
dragon in the United States, and only the third in the world, to
carry its eggs effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tense times'' are expected around the aquarium until the sea
dragon gives birth, said Sandy Trautwein, the curator of fishes and
invertebrates. The gestation period is six weeks and the birth is
expected the week of June 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since no one has done it successfully before,'' Trautwein
said, ``there is no recipe. I'm going by instinct.''
</P>
<P>
   The sea dragon, a relative of the sea horse, has a reputation
for being particularly delicate, both in captivity and in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   Endemic to the seaweed beds where the Southern Ocean meets the
South Pacific, these famously fragile swimmers essentially rely on
their camouflage to survive. They look almost exactly like a small
piece of seaweed that has broken off the mother plant and has
quietly sprouted eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Often the victims of habitat destruction, sea dragons have
become a protected species in Australia. Trautwein said that only
two people have permits to collect them. The sea dragons'
precarious situation and delicate nature make the potential
aquarium birth all the more significant to naturalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am extremely jealous,'' said Bob Burhans, the curator of the
Birch Aquarium in La Jolla, Calif. ``I've had weedy sea dragons for
four years and have never gotten to this point.''
</P>
<P>
   When Trautwein does one of her several checks a day, she looks
to see if any of his eggs have dropped. The reproduction of a sea
dragon relies on the transfer of eggs from the female to the male's
``brood patch,'' a section of blood-rich indentations on the
underside of his tail. When the males are ready, the patch widens
and releases a fluid that helps the eggs stay attached for four to
six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past, aquarium males have not been ready to commit.
At Germany's Stuttgart Aquarium, the male dropped a few eggs each
week until only five were left. At Tokyo's Sea Life Park, several
eggs hatched but survived for only eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   So far Mr. Mom has dropped a few eggs, but not at a very fast
rate, ``So I feel it's a tremendous success,'' Trautwein said.
</P>
<P>
   In order to ensure that Mr. Mom's eggs can endure the breeding
process, the Long Beach aquarium is trying to mimic the seasonal
changes of the sea dragon's typical environment. But Burhans notes
that maintaining the correct length of daylight hours is often
impossible to achieve because visitors may want to see the exhibits
at the same time the fish would prefer darkness.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Trautwein will try to keep Mr. Mom
comfortable in his usual tank for as long as she can. About a week
before the birth, she plans to move him to a holding tank within
the same water system but with controlled lighting and temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Mom is still in the exhibit, where visitors can note how
weighed down he looks by his cluster of eggs. Yet when mysids, the
tiny shrimplike crustaceans that he feeds on, are dropped into the
tank, he suddenly moves with the ease of all the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's definitely eating more than he used to,'' said Trautwein,
who is reassured by Mr. Mom's appetite.
</P>
<P>
   ``His nutrition helps the health of the eggs so it's a good sign
that he's eating,'' Trautwein said. At the other aquariums, the
males had stopped eating.
</P>
<P>
   Trautwein explained that whatever happens, the Mr. Mom
experience has given her hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a dream last night that one of our leafy sea dragons had
also laid eggs on the male's tail during the night,'' she said. ``I
drove to work this morning thinking that it might be true.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, a leafy was releasing some eggs by the time
Trautwein arrived, though there was no male ready to accept them.
Perhaps Mr. Mom will show one of them the way.

MICHAEL JACKSON'S LEGACY LIVES ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Michael Jackson anointed himself King of Pop nine years
ago, he had already missed his cue by several beats. It was 1991.
Grunge was brewing. The emerging alternative rock loudly condemned
the glitz and commercialism of good-time fare like Jackson's. A new
radical fringe was, in time-honored tradition, rearing its unruly
head, and the sound of music was changing _ fast. Jackson's
self-coronation was more a desperate gesture from a suddenly
outdated icon than a timely assessment of Jackson's reign, which
had already begun its long, strange decline into dark eccentricity.
</P>
<P>
   His prodigious artistic accomplishments during the phenomenal
run that spanned 1979's ``Off the Wall,'' 1982's ``Thriller,'' and
1987's ``Bad'' paled _ like his skin color _ with each new
revelation about his bizarre lifestyle. Jackson's morphing
appearance was the most distressing quirk of all. In the process of
obliterating his race, neutralizing his gender, and erasing his
sexuality, Jackson managed to expunge his musical identity as well.
</P>
<P>
   But time has a way of twisting itself inside out when it comes
to cultural trends. While the art may have been eclipsed by his
hellish life story, Michael Jackson's musical legacy is alive and
well. In terms of influence, Jackson is, in fact, the King of Pop,
circa 2000. His pioneering fusion of dance, rock, pop, and soul,
his merging of black and white sounds, and his highly stylized
phrasing and tautly controlled dancing are at the heart of the
music sweeping today's charts _ from Backstreet Boys and Britney
Spears to LFO and 'N Sync.
</P>
<P>
   The commodified assembly-line look and sound of today's teen
acts is the direct descendant of a look and sound that was, at its
inception two decades ago, a pop-culture breakthrough. In 1979,
then-21-year-old Jackson and veteran producer Quincy Jones
collaborated on ``Off the Wall.'' It did more than just present the
former Motown boy wonder as a mature artist. Songs like ``Don't
Stop 'Til You Get Enough,'' ``Rock With You,'' and the title track
introduced a blend of slick disco rhythms, Motown soul, and
pop-radio sweetness that cut a clean swath through genre and color
barriers.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Thriller,'' released in 1983, Jackson and Jones ensured
that their vision, the glamorous new dance-pop, became a global
phenomenon. The album's masterful artistry is easily obscured by
its staggering commercial success: 46 million sold, eight Grammy
awards, an unprecedented seven Top 10 singles. But the album's real
significance was crystallized in Eddie Van Halen's searing rock
guitar solo on ``Beat It.'' It was a resounding shout-out for
Jackson's blanket crossover, emblematic of an invigorating new
sound that was embraced by lovers of soul, pop fans, the burgeoning
hip-hop nation, and rock enthusiasts. ``Beat It'' became the first
video by a black artist to spin into heavy rotation on MTV. With
the subsequent elaborate song-and-dance videos for ``Billie Jean''
and ``Thriller,'' Jackson helped pioneer the video medium, which
would become the lifeblood of the next generation's glossy
dance-pop stars.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it didn't take two decades for the impact of
Jackson's sound to reverberate in the industry. The poster boys of
1980, New Edition and (especially) New Kids on the Block, both
Boston bands, were influenced as much by the bubble-gum soul of the
Jackson 5 as by Jackson's sophisticated solo work. A decade later,
the teen band Hanson seemed to be channeling the Jackson 5 on its
breakthrough song, ``MMMBop.'' But what's striking about those '80s
powerhouses is the fact that impresario Maurice Starr, who created
both groups, essentially substituted white kids for black kids in
the identical musical mold.
</P>
<P>
   Lines erased
</P>
<P>
   The line between traditional black and white sounds had for all
intents and purposes been erased _ ironically enough by a man who
had literally scrubbed himself free of color. It paved the way for
a group composed entirely of white middle-class boys who sang a
hybrid of new jack balladry, hip-hop R &AMP; B, and sentimental pop.
Even the quintet's name, the Backstreet Boys, evoked a mixture of
urban cool and mild-mannered youthfulness _ a study in
contradictions purveyed by Jackson, as well. The world hadn't seen
the sort of mass cross-cultural hysteria inspired by the Backstreet
Boys since Michael Jackson's heyday.
</P>
<P>
   'N Sync _ yet another grouping of five young male singers _
followed in short order. The band's second album, ``No Strings
Attached,'' which sold a record-setting 2.6 million copies its
first week out in March, owes still more to Jackson's legacy with
its meticulously crafted mixture of hard beats, breezy pop, techno
flourishes, and lush ballads.
</P>
<P>
   Take the band's current single, ``Bye Bye Bye'' (although one
could conduct the same exercise with just about any of the current
hits in the genre). Held notes on electronic strings start the
song; the anticipatory mood is shortly punctured by a young man's
tenor, loosing a cry of ``hey, hey.'' A wall of beats kicks in, a
wave of synthesizers swells _ merging into restless, rhythmic
bedrock for the singer's compact vocal lines and tight harmonies.
It's driving, melodic, and funky. You can practically see the guys'
synchronized, cookie-cutter dance moves.
</P>
<P>
   That musical arc, while not an explicit copy, is a direct
descendant of ``Thriller.'' On ``Beat It,'' for example,
keyboard-generated bells toll for a few brief bars, then drums drop
in with a steady stream of robotic beats, followed in short order
by a towering groove built from banks of synths and scathing power
chords. The young tenor unleashes taut vocal lines and layers of
harmonies over the churning, jittery rhythms. It's driving,
melodic, and funky. You can practically see the singer's signature
syncopated dance moves.
</P>
<P>
   Today's teens execute slick routines like the advanced
dance-class graduates they are. At his zenith, Jackson merged song
and dance into a seamless whole. And while no one since has matched
Jackson's jaw-dropping instinct for maneuvering his body in the
slivery spaces of a song, the highly stylized movement pioneered by
Jackson has become a ritual component of contemporary pop.
</P>
<P>
   Lather, rinse, repeat
</P>
<P>
   One simply never sees a stage or video performance that doesn't
feature a battalion of choreographed urban warriors. Teen queen
Britney Spears has incurred the wrath of critics by choosing to
lip-synch upbeat numbers in concert, but she has to in order to
conserve lung power for her nonstop dance routines. There's really
no alternative, considering Spears's generic dance-pop singles
function much like window dressing for the herky-jerky body
language that's become common currency in the teen dance-pop
market.
</P>
<P>
   Spears's vocal register, like Jackson's, is tight and narrow,
and on the new ``Oops! . . . I Did It Again'' she has co-opted
Jackson's clipped, tic-strewn phrasing as an effective way of
asserting style over substance. A symphony of synthesizers straight
out of ``Thriller'' cushion Spears's little growls and cries, and
the tune's massive beats. Her remake of the Rolling Stones'
``Satisfaction'' is anchored on the high end by ethereal synths
nearly identical to those on ``Billie Jean,'' and on the low end by
urgent, clamping breaths and rhythmic ``ughs'' _ trademarks of
Jackson's blockbuster hits that surely weren't lost on Spears's
producers. (Spears's new CD sold 1.3 million copies in its first
week of release, second only to 'N Sync for an out-of-the-box sales
performance. In third place: the Backstreet Boys.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Michael Jackson is in the studio _ actually 10
different studios with nearly as many producers _ working on his
next album, which Sony hopes will be ready for release later this
year. The stakes are high for Jackson, 41. Now that the dance-pop
he crafted at the highest level has been watered down, filtered
out, and recycled as fossil fuel for the next generation, Jackson
must reinvent the wheel one more time. He needs to record songs
that are more compelling than sordid tales of consorting with
children. He'll have to summon the courage to leave Neverland and
reenter the real world if he hopes to transcend a decade of his own
tired, bloodless music _ the sad product of his self-imposed
isolation. Otherwise, Jackson's legacy will be reduced to a
synthesizer arrangement here, a spunky dance move there, a
high-pitched cry in a pop song.

   NEW RELEASES: ``Snow Falling on Cedars'' (DVD) _ Robert
Richardson's camera work delivers the cinematic equivalent of the
novel's lyrical style in this complicated story of alienation and
politics set against the internment of the American Japanese during
World War II. Richardson deserved the cinematography Oscar he was
nominated for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man on the Moon'' _ The trouble with playing famous people is
that no matter how good the performance, it still fails. In this
case, Jim Carrey as Andy Kaufman tries extremely hard to capture
the essence of the crazy comic but falls short. The problem is that
we can compare the real Kaufman doing his famous bits on tapes such
as ``Andy Kaufman Plays Carnegie Hall.'' While the film is well
worth watching, it's too much of a paint-by-numbers movie in which
respect for Kaufman precludes Carrey from conveying what was at the
character's core _ anarchic disrespect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 20th Century'' (10 volumes) (DVD) _ This extraordinary
series documents the 20th century through vintage newsreel film. Of
course, the idea of snaring the century on 10 volumes of video
means some of the events make Reader's Digest seem like Proust. But
as with, say, NBA highlight films, it is a terrific overview of the
United States' perspective of the past 100 years.

<TEXT>
<P>
   (BS)(BS) 1/2 ``M:i-2'' It's big, noisy, explosive, and
marginally more coherent than the first ``Mission: Impossible.''
But it's also pretty labored. Tom Cruise's heroics are too clenched
and intense, and John Woo's direction is too driven, to allow for
much fun in this big pop comic strip. In this nominal chase after a
deadly virus, Cruise's sunglasses are cooler than he is. (PG-13)
</P>
<P>
   (BS)(BS) 1/2 ``Passion of Mind'' A softer, more appealing Demi
Moore, back after a hiatus of several years, as a woman leading a
split life, trying to figure out whether her life as a single mom
in the French countryside with lover Stellan Skarsgard is the real
thing, or whether it's her glam existence as a Manhattan literary
agent with William Fichtner's doting accountant. Glossy stuff,
recalling Hollywood's discovery of Freud in the '40s, but not very
passionate. (PG-13)
</P>
<P>
   (FL) (BS)(BS)(BS) ``Shanghai Noon'' Jackie Chan again, giving us
the film ``Wild, Wild West'' wishes it was. A kidnapped Chinese
princess is all the pretext the movie needs to plunk Chan into the
Old West to unleash another outbreak of his exuberant, inventive
acrobatics. Owen Wilson makes a droll foil, handling the
smart-mouthing with aplomb. (PG-13)
</P>
<P>
   (BS)(BS)(BS) ``Welcome Back, Mr. McDonald'' Koki Mitani's
outrageously funny show-business comedy illustrates, in a most
amusing fashion, the destructive power of the ego. In Japanese with
English subtitles. (Unrated) (Michael Blowen)

NOVEL CANCER THERAPIES ARE EXPLORED 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN, M.D.    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ In the war on cancer, researchers seem to have
reached a plateau in the benefits from chemotherapy, the drug
combinations that kill cancerous cells as well as normal ones. So
cancer researchers have been exploring original approaches.
</P>
<P>
   A new hope is to tap into insights about the machinery of cancer
cells that scientists have gained in the laboratory in recent years
and to convert this knowledge into novel therapies. It is a type of
research known as molecular targeting, and it is in its earliest
phases of testing on humans.
</P>
<P>
   Molecular targeting gets its name from the use of experimental
drugs that strike selectively at specific areas in cancerous cells
to disrupt their functions.
</P>
<P>
   Other drugs, known as angiogenesis inhibitors, are used to
thwart the growth of new blood vessels and to starve malignant
cells from their supply of oxygen and nourishment. These drugs have
achieved striking results in reversing cancer in mice and have
raised hopes that they will be effective in humans.
</P>
<P>
   In initial testing on humans, many new experimental therapies
produce unexpected findings, and those reported at a meeting of the
American Society of Clinical Oncology here last week were no
exception.
</P>
<P>
   The surprises included some benefits where none were expected,
validating the concept. But there were also some lethal effects,
raising concerns about their safety.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the mixed reviews, researchers said they saw enough
potential to push on.
</P>
<P>
   Novel therapies are usually first tested on the sickest
patients, those with most to gain and least to lose. Under the Food
and Drug Administration's three-stage testing system, the first
phase focuses on the safety of experimental drugs. Randomized
controlled trials, regarded as the scientific gold standard because
they compare new therapies with standard ones or placebos, usually
come later.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, tests on more humans will be needed before the FDA will
license any of the experimental therapies. Meanwhile, the doctors
conducting the trials and the manufacturers of the experimental
drugs have eagerly promoted the early findings, in part to solicit
new patients and strengthen their stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Among those that the oncology society highlighted are these:
</P>
<P>
   _ A monoclonal antibody that ImClone Systems has developed as
C225 has shown promise in testing among people with advanced
cancers of the colon, head and neck. Monoclonal antibodies are
proteins that are engineered to detect and bind to other proteins
that are present on cancer cells and that aim at thwarting a
cancer's ability to grow. All 15 patients with advanced head and
neck cancers who received a combination of radiation and of C225
had full or significant shrinkage of their tumors, Dr. James Bonner
of the University of Alabama reported.
</P>
<P>
   The participants were followed for more than two and a half
years. Six have died, and the other nine are alive, apparently free
of disease. The shrinkage has lasted for 27 or more months in four
patients. Normally, fewer than half survive after one and a half
years, Bonner said.
</P>
<P>
   _ AstraZeneca's drug known as ZD1839 is designed to block a
protein, epidermal growth factor. The drug unexpectedly shrank
tumors and prolonged survival in a first stage study, where
efficacy is rarely shown, said Dr. David Ferry of the Institute for
Cancer Studies in Birmingham, England. The study included patients
from two hospitals in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   _ Genentech's Rhumab is a monoclonal antibody and
anti-angiogenesis drug designed to block a growth factor in blood
vessels. In a randomized controlled trial involving 99 patients at
Vanderbilt University, the lung cancer spread after 7.4 months in a
group receiving Rhumab and standard chemotherapy, compared with 4.2
months among those who received chemotherapy only, Dr. Russell
DeVore reported. But, unexpectedly, six patients taking Rhumab
suddenly began coughing up blood and four of them died, DeVore
said. Because the four deaths occurred in patients with the
squamous cell form of lung cancer, researchers are trying to
determine whether something about this type of tumor would preclude
use of Rhumab for such patients.
</P>
<P>
   _ In a study involving 28 patients, intravenous injections of
Sugen's drug, SU5416, combined with standard chemotherapy stopped
advanced colon cancer growth for a median of nine months, compared
with six months for standard therapy alone, said Dr. Lee Rosen of
the University of California at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   _ Removing a cancerous kidney and delivering an immune therapy
known as interferon alfa 2b increased survival to an average of 12
months compared with immune therapy alone in a study begun in 1991
and conducted in several hospitals, said its leader, Dr. Robert
Flanigan of Loyola University in Maywood, Ill. Although the
improvement in survival was relatively small, longer benefits may
come from trials involving newer immune drugs and surgery in
advanced kidney cancer, Flanigan said.
</P>
<P>
   Until major new therapies and preventions knock cancer out as
the second leading cause of death among Americans, after heart
disease, doctors will often have to deliver bad news to such
patients. Dr. Robert Lenzi of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in
Houston conducted a survey of his colleagues at a society meeting
in 1998. More than 90 percent of the 500 oncologists surveyed said
they had no formal training in breaking bad news and managing
related emotional reactions.
</P>
<P>
   Top challenges were being honest without destroying hope and
effectively communicating with crying or angry patients. About
one-quarter of those surveyed had a consistent strategy for
breaking bad news.
</P>
<P>
   Lenzi said there were signs that medical schools and teaching
hospitals that train residents were beginning to use methods known
to be effective, like role playing, group discussion, videotaping
and feedback in training programs.

ETHIOPIA BOMBS AIRPORT IN ERITREAN CAPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By IAN FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASMARA, Eritrea _ Ethiopian fighter planes bombed the airport
here Monday, targeting a military airstrip in the first air raid on
Eritrea's capital since the opening blows of the war between the
two nations in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The raid was carried out even as the nations' foreign ministers
prepared to open a new round of peace talks in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an outrage,'' said Yemane Ghebremeskel, a spokesman
for the Eritrean government. ``The timing is inexplicable.''
</P>
<P>
   But officials from Ethiopia, which began a major offensive two
weeks ago, repeated their intention to continue fighting while
talking about peace. In Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital, Lt. Gen.
Tsadakan Gebretensae, the armed forces' chief of staff, said the
airport was a legitimate military target.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to incapacitate the Eritrean air force, and this
operation was conducted in line with this objective,'' he said at a
news conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
   No one was killed in the attack, just three miles from the
capital, though officials here said two civilians were wounded.
Four Ethiopian MiG-23s dropped the bombs Monday morning on the
military section of the airport, which also handles civilian air
traffic. One bomb apparently hit a control tower, but most of the
bombs seemed to have landed in the grass, setting off brush fires.
At least one bomb also hit the road leading to the city.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said two Eritrean MiG-29s, which were parked at the
airport, were not damaged and chased the Ethiopian planes.
</P>
<P>
   Talks were scheduled to begin Monday in Algeria between the
nations' foreign ministers, Seyoum Mesfin of Ethiopia and Haile
Woldensae of Eritrea, though the Ethiopian delegation only arrived
in the afternoon. Last week, Eritrea agreed to withdraw from the
disputed areas along the 620-mile border, after significant
military gains by Ethiopia in the last two weeks. Only minutes
before the bombing, a plane carrying reporters and foreign
diplomats took off from the airport on a trip organized by the
Eritrean government to prove that its troops had withdrawn from the
town of Bure, near the port of Assab on the Red Sea. The plane was
turned back.
</P>
<P>
   The airport is the main portal for food arriving in Asmara to
feed the hundreds of thousands of people displaced by the war in
the last two weeks. Lindsey Davies, a spokeswoman for the U.N.
World Food Program, said none of the three flights of food
scheduled for this week have been canceled. But they may be halted
if there are more attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a game of cards at moment,'' she said. ``We really have
to see how the situation pans out.''

AUTHOR OFFERS THEORY ON GRAY MATTER OF LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By NATALIE ANGIER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Look around a human-wrought landscape like Manhattan, and the
term Homo manipulens might spring to mind. People are irrepressible
toolmakers, slapping down grid systems and trumping up towers, and
braking for nothing but the occasional Starbucks. Surely the human
mind evolved to wrest from the environment every possible survival
advantage, including a cell phone that works in the subway.
</P>
<P>
   But think again about Manhattan, and the things that make it
livable: the museums, ballet corps, jazz clubs, comedy acts, drag
shows. What good are they, really? More precisely, how can
humanity's boundless thirst for the arts be explained in Darwinian
terms as the product of natural selection _ the evolutionary
process most commonly soundbitten as ``survival of the fittest?''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Geoffrey Miller, an evolutionary psychologist at University
College, London, says it cannot. As Miller sees it, the most
outstanding features of the human mind _ its creativity, its
consciousness, its moral sense, its artfulness and its love of a
good punch line _ were shaped not by natural selection but by the
other strong evolutionary force called sexual selection.
</P>
<P>
   In this view, which he lays out in his new book, ``The Mating
Mind'' (Doubleday), humans are imaginative, artistic, humorous and
relatively amiable for the same reason that peacocks fan their
fancy tails and cicadas thrum through the summer: to attract mates
and increase their so-called reproductive success.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1965 in Ohio and educated at Columbia, Miller has lived
in England for seven years, long enough to say things like
``cheerio'' and to assume the lanky, languid air of British film
charmers like Ralph Fiennes or Ben Chaplin. He talked about his
book and the underappreciated power of sexual choice, in a recent
stop in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Give me a quick-and-dirty explanation of the difference
between natural selection and sexual selection.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Natural selection is about living long enough to reproduce.
Sexual selection is about convincing others to mate with you. It's
about animal minds, our ancestors' minds, influencing other minds,
which is why it appealed to me as a way of understanding the
evolution of the human mind.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. So what's wrong with the idea of the mind as problem solver,
or of humans as the best of all handymen?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. When you think of what makes humans unique, you think of art,
music, our sense of humor, our creativity. For 140 years,
biologists have attempted to explain these traits by means of
natural selection, and survival of the fittest, and they have
completely failed to make the connection between Darwinism and the
humanities. And as I read the standard evolutionary psychology
stuff on mate choice, I thought there were several pieces of the
puzzle that were missing here. I thought it was quite possible that
art and music and creativity have quite a lot to do with somebody's
psychological attraction.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. One of your premises is the idea that technological
innovation was at a standstill during most of our brain evolution,
suggesting that the brain was evolving for reasons other than to
make better tools. Why do you think that was so?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Two million years ago, our ancestors were making and using
hand-axes and other stone tools. Their brains tripled in size over
the following 1.75 million years. By the time brain size increase
stopped, the hand ax and similar tools were still in use around the
world. Only in the last 100,000 years have we had all the increase
in technological complexity. So you've got brain size increase
first, and that stops, and then the tool use increases, very, very
recently in evolutionary terms. You couldn't ask for a worse
correlation in terms of evolutionary trends. The traditional story
that brains are technophilic, tool-producing machines just doesn't
match the archaeological evidence.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Let's talk about why early humans focused on the brain and
mental traits when selecting their mates.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We must bear in mind that brains were already important to
great apes generally by the time we started to diverge from chimps
five million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   There's a consensus now that selection for social intelligence
is extremely important in the emergence of great apes compared to
other primates, like monkeys. If social intelligence in a general
sense was crucial to survival and reproduction among these
relatively big-brained primates like proto-chimps, then sexual
choice has a powerful incentive to look for evidence of social
intelligence when choosing a mate.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the bigger and more complex the brain gets, the larger
the proportion of genes in the genome are involved in brain
development. If you're choosing a mate for his or her genetic
quality, what you want to focus on are the traits that give you the
best window on the quality of the individual's genome.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Q. But we went further than chimpanzees did in attending to
mental traits. Why is that?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm afraid I'll have to invoke Stephen Jay Gould here, and
say there is a strong component of contingency in sexual selection,
much more so than in natural selection.
</P>
<P>
   I think that most theoretical biologists recognize that sexual
selection is evolution's wild card.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Talk about the handicap principle here, which is so important
to sexual selection theory, and to your book.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I didn't really understand the handicap principle until I
read Thorstein Veblen talking about conspicuous consumption in his
classic, ``Theory of the Leisure Class.'' I think there are close
analogies between luxury goods that we acquire and sexual
ornaments. What makes a good a luxury good is simply the cost. The
more something costs, and the more reliably it can say ``I'm
expensive,'' then the better an indicator it makes of wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Amotz Zahavi reinvented Veblen's principle and applied it to
sexual selection. The peacock's tail is not just an arbitrary
outcome of sexual selection. It's there because it's costly, which
means only those fit, healthy, strong peacocks can afford to carry
around those tails.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. It's easy to see the handicap principle as applying to the
peacock's tail, but to human intelligence?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It's important to distinguish between the mental traits that
I think really are handicaps from those that aren't. Our brighter
ancestors would have survived better and attracted more mates.
</P>
<P>
   So the handicap principle doesn't apply to intelligence per se.
But I think it does apply to behaviors like art, music and humor,
or poetic uses of language, or the production of fictional stories.
In those instances, nobody has been able to find any possible
survival function. And yet, for the people that do these things,
the traits consume enormous amounts of time and energy, not only to
produce them, but to learn the skills necessary to produce them.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. So creativity becomes a ``fitness indicator,'' a way to strut
one's quality, precisely because it is so wasteful and expensive?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Once mate choice identifies a trait as informative about
something, that trait is going to be under strong selection to
amplify its appearance. Those who invest the most energy, the most
maintenance time, the most genes, into growing the trait, will
attract the most mates. One of the book's main ideas is that the
human traits of art, music and creativity are in there by design,
as fitness indicators.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You also propose that a father's devotion to his children,
and his willingness to care for them, may be an unconscious
courtship display, an extension of an ancestral man's willingness
to show a woman that he is a kind and gentle guy who will treat her
kids well, even if they were fathered by the fellow who came before
him. What's the evidence?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. One valid bit of evidence is simply the behavior of modern
fathers across cultures. A typical problem with divorce is that
divorced men seriously reduce their investment in their children.
If paternal instincts had evolved simply for the good of their
children, fathers shouldn't care whether they're sleeping with the
mother. These are their kids, they should be supporting them,
investing in them, acting like they recognize that the kids are
vehicles carrying their genes. But the sad truth is that it's very
hard to get a lot of men to pay child support.
</P>
<P>
   But I feel a bit humble about making predictions about what's
testable in my book and what's not, given the rate of advance in
genetics. A good theory should go in advance of the evidence. It
shouldn't be circumscribed by the evidence. It should stick its
neck out and say, this is how I think the world is, and leave it to
other people to test it.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. One of the refreshing things about your book is that you
discuss mutual mate selection for mental traits, and the idea that
the female mind isn't just a consolation prize _ that intelligence,
wittiness, creativity may have been sexually selected in women just
as it was in men.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Absolutely. Darwin got almost everything right, except that
he did view the human female brain as riding along on the
evolutionary coat-tails of the male brain. I think that's wrong.
And a lot of my colleagues still have this fixed idea that sexual
selection always implies sex differences. They know in their hearts
that we're a species with mutual choice, but they tend to ignore
it.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What about your own mate choice? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. She's a television producer, and, as a psychologist, I
introspected quite a bit as we were falling in love. I think I was
drawn to her because she was very witty and funny and a woman I
thought I could learn a lot from. You look for somebody who you
feel you could talk to for years without getting bored, and when
you find that person it's a very exciting event.  &QL;

 &HT;    Interest-only loans ease rate burden
 &HT;    By Susan Harte
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Steadily rising mortgage interest rates not only have
prospective home buyers scrambling to find the best rates, they
also have the lending industry busy looking for new ways to attract
borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   Home-loan interest rates have risen 2 percentage points since
this time last year, practically drying up the refinancing market.
Many current homeowners remain satisfied with interest rates well
below what the market is charging now.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, only 13 percent of a typical lender's portfolio
comes from refinancing, compared with half of its loans just a few
years ago. Overall, mortgage applications are down 10 percent from
12 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The lending industry is turning to interest-only loans with
lower monthly payments than conventional mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   It is just starting to catch on with certain local consumers and
is so new that most home-loan banks don't even offer it on first
mortgages. But HomeBanc, which started developing its HomePower
Classic loan product four years ago, is now writing $65 million a
month in interest-only loans. They account for 25 to 30 percent of
mortgage originations, said spokesman Mark Scott.
</P>
<P>
   The loan is made to order for people who want a lower monthly
payment in a time when interest rates around 8.5 percent can add
hundreds of dollars a month to a conventional loan payment.
</P>
<P>
   The lower monthly payments that resulted from the lower interest
rates that refinancing accomplished two years ago, an interest-only
loan can accomplish now.
</P>
<P>
   The loan is what it says it is _ a mortgage on which buyers pay
interest, but no principal, for a period of eight to 10 years.
After that, the loan reverts to a conventional form, and the
borrower repays the balance of interest due, plus principal, for
perhaps 20 more years. A customary down payment is required, but
monthly payments are lower.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the interest rate is generally lower than for a
conventional loan.
</P>
<P>
   For buyers who stay in their home less than seven years, a
common occurrence in metro Atlanta, the payments on principal may
not make that much difference.
</P>
<P>
   In the first years of a mortgage, a substantial amount of the
payment goes toward interest and very little toward principal. In
an area where home prices are rising, owners could see their equity
increasing faster through appreciation than by paying down the
principal by the time they sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get more bang for your buck with this product,'' said
Charles Wagner, HomePower brand manager. ``You may want to take the
saved money and invest it in your 401(k) plan, to bring you up to
the maximum contribution. You might pay off the high-interest
credit cards.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people, like Mary Catherine Doering, want a lower payment
for more personal reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Doering, an Atlanta obstetrician/gynecologist, recently took out
a HomePower Classic loan that will require her to pay the interest
only on her loan for eight to 10 years. After that, the instrument
converts to a conventional, 15-year mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   Doering wanted a lower-payment loan that would allow her the
flexibility to reduce the principal payment as opportunity arose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a 10-year-old daughter and am trying to structure my
life to take care of her, be with her and be there for her. That
means working less,'' said Doering, whose real-estate agent
suggested the interest-only mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   ``This stretches her financial flexibility,'' observed Doug
Perry, senior vice president of California-based Countrywide Home
Loans' consumer marketing division.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, cash-strapped professionals expecting big salary
increases or bonuses in the next few years will also find
interest-only mortgages appealing, said Wayne Fuller, a loan
officer at Tucker Federal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are your own banker. You can pay the home debt down
quickly or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Tucker Federal does not offer interest-only on first
mortgages, it does offer them on seconds and equity credit lines.
</P>
<P>
   Both Perry and Wagner warned that there is one major drawback to
this loan: careless use of the monthly savings. People who fail to
save the difference, or who do not put it to a use such as reducing
principal, are missing the point, which the bankers said is to
diversify financially.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do this strictly for cash flow, you will not maximize
the benefits of this program,'' Wagner said.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   From any perspective, the remote, rugged country surrounding the
Bitterroot Mountains in western Montana and central Idaho appears
ideal for grizzly bears. Here are the types of terrain grizzlies
love: alpine meadows; pine, cedar and fir forests; glacial lakes
and fast-running streams flowing into lush river valleys.
</P>
<P>
   Although salmon have declined sharply, the roots, berries, nuts,
elk, deer and insects the giants need to fuel their six-month
hibernation abound. Indeed, hundreds of the big bears that the Nez
Perce tribe called xaxat roamed this area when Lewis and Clark
passed through in 1806, killing seven. In the next decades,
hundreds of grizzlies fell to hunters, with the last recorded kill
in 1932. Despite several exhaustive surveys, no one has seen a
grizzly bear in this region for more than half a century.
</P>
<P>
   That situation is about to change. This summer, the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service is expected to adopt a controversial plan to
put grizzly bears back in the Bitterroot region. A 15-member
citizen management committee will be charged with finding a way for
the bears to flourish and coexist with humans, particularly those
engaged in backcountry recreation, logging, mining and ranching.
</P>
<P>
   If threatened congressional and legal challenges from Idaho do
not delay the plan from being carried out, the management committee
will complete preparations for the arrival of the first bears in
2002, said Dr. Christopher Servheen, grizzly bear recovery
coordinator for the Fish and Wildlife Service, based in Missoula,
Mont. Over five years, at least 25 bears will be released in the
Bitterroots. Because of the grizzly's slow reproductive rate, it
will take 50 to 110 years for the population to reach the project's
goal of 280 bears.
</P>
<P>
   Servheen said the reintroduction was an essential step in
ensuring the long-term survival of the grizzly in the lower 48
states and its removal from the endangered species list, where it
has been designated as ``threatened'' since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Like the wolves released in Yellowstone National Park and these
same Bitterroots in 1995 and 1996, the grizzlies will be relocated
as a ``nonessential experimental population'' under the Endangered
Species Act. That designation makes it easier to remove bears that
come into conflict with people or fail to thrive. It also allows
officials to suspend habitat protections that ordinarily apply to
endangered species, thereby giving them greater flexibility in
dealing with land-use conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know enough about the biology of bears to manage them,''
Servheen said. ``The limiting factor is the behavior of people. We
have to strike a balance between the needs of bears and the needs
of people.'' Finding that balance is the task of the citizen
management committee, appointed by the secretary of the interior,
and made up of local people from Montana and Idaho, the Nez Perce
tribe, the National Forest Service and the Fish and Wildlife
Service.
</P>
<P>
   North America's largest carnivore, the grizzly bear is a figure
of legendary might. A subspecies of the brown bear named for its
silver-tipped guard hairs, which appeared ``grizzly'' to early
explorers, it stands up to 7-feet tall and weighs 300 to 600
pounds, with some reaching 800 pounds. Highly protective of their
food and young, aggressive in response to surprises, and solitary
by habit, the big bears are often considered dangerously
antisocial.
</P>
<P>
   Grizzly bears are relatively abundant in parts of Canada and
Alaska, but in the western United States, where Servheen estimates
that 50,000 roamed at the time of Lewis and Clark's expedition,
they number fewer than 1,000 and occupy only about 2 percent of
their original range. The remaining bears are largely concentrated
in and around Yellowstone National Park, Glacier National Park and
the Bob Marshall Wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife biologists have long recommended establishing another
population of bears in the Bitterroot region to lessen the risk of
extinction and ultimately provide a vital genetic link between the
geographically isolated grizzlies in Yellowstone and those farther
north. The grizzlies are also expected to improve the health of the
Bitterroot ecosystem. The region contains the largest expanse of
contiguous federal lands in the lower 48 states, covering some
26,000 square miles, and includes two vast roadless areas, the
Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness and the
Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness, which are considered ideal for
grizzly bears, whose home territory can reach 500 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   Bears for the reintroduction will be taken from Yellowstone
National Park, Glacier National Park and Canada. The bears are
expected to adjust without much difficulty, unless they run afoul
of humans; 79 percent of grizzlies that die prematurely do so at
the hands of humans, said Dr. David Mattson, a wildlife biologist
with the United States Geological Survey's Biological Resources
Division in Flagstaff, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Many opponents of the reintroduction plan fear grizzly attacks,
a possibility that most bear biologists consider remote, especially
in the first years of the project. Dr. Stephen Herrero, an emeritus
professor of environmental science at the University of Calgary and
a leading expert on bear attacks, said, ``There are 700,000 black
bears and 70,000 grizzly bears in North America and on average they
kill three people a year and injure a dozen to two dozen. People
fear these animals because they can be violent and cause injury or
death, but once people know about bears, they can respect them and
live with them without danger.''
</P>
<P>
   All the reintroduced bears will be equipped with radio collars
so that wildlife biologists can monitor their health and movements,
Servheen said. The citizen management committee and wildlife
officials will also work to allay people's fear of bears and to
prevent the sorts of situations and conflicts that lead to the
deaths of bears or people.

</P>
<P>
   Establishment of the citizen management committee represents a
triumph for a coalition consisting of the Resource Organization on
Timber Supply, a group of timber companies and unions with
headquarters in Lewiston, Idaho; the Intermountain Forest Industry
Association, in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho; the National Wildlife
Federation; and Defenders of Wildlife. In 1995, that coalition
presented the concept to Servheen and the grizzly bear recovery
team as a way to allow logging, recreation and other activities to
continue in the company of bears.
</P>
<P>
   The Fish and Wildlife Service embraced the idea, which was
hailed nationally as a sign that a new spirit of cooperation was
taking hold in the West after years of bitter conflict over land
use and the Endangered Species Act. Despite a poll showing that a
vast majority of people regionally and nationally wanted grizzlies,
the plan was immediately caught in the sort of fierce political
struggle it was intended to prevent.
</P>
<P>
   A number of environmental groups oppose the plan, and have
proposed an alternative plan for the grizzlies. ``This plan is not
the best we could do for bears,'' said Mike Bader, executive
director of the Alliance for the Wild Rockies, which is based in
Missoula, Mont. He said the plan went too far in accommodating the
timber industry and not far enough in protecting grizzly bears and
their habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-bear groups and a majority of the region's political
leaders complain that because the grizzly is not at immediate risk
of extinction, the federal government is needlessly unloosing a
predator that is a threat to humans. They also contend that because
the citizen management committee must report to the secretary of
the interior, who has legal authority for endangered species, the
plan does not cede enough control to state and local officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Idaho congressional delegation has worked for several years
to block the reintroduction, and Gov. Dirk Kempthorne has publicly
threatened to file suit to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Mulligan, president of Three Rivers Timber Inc., of Kamiah,
Idaho, and co-chairman of the Resource Organization on Timber
Supply, said that anger over the Clinton administration's roadless
plan for national forests and proposals to restore the salmon and
steelhead trout runs on the Snake River had stirred anti-government
sentiment. People have directed their anger and alienation over
those issues at the timber industry and the union groups backing
the grizzly reintroduction, making it difficult for them to rally
support. ``We get beat up pretty bad at public hearings on
grizzlies,'' Mulligan said. ``But we made a deal with the best of
intentions and so we have stuck to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Alone among prominent officials in Montana and Idaho, Gov. Marc
Racicot of Montana has supported the reintroduction plan, while
negotiating on questions relating to the powers of the citizen
management committee, financing and the health and source of the
bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``The citizen management committee offers a new opportunity to
engage people who live next door to these truly majestic animals,
to see whether people can take charge and get involved in a
thoughtful and meaningful way in the process of preserving
endangered species,'' Racicot said.

`CAMERA IN A PILL' VIEWS DIGESTIVE TRACT 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   They haven't figured out how to squeeze Raquel Welch into it,
but scientists with an Israeli company have made a pill-size
videocamera that takes a fantastic voyage of its own, traveling
through the digestive tract and transmitting pictures along the
way.
</P>
<P>
   The device, which consists of the camera and light source, radio
transmitter and batteries within a sealed capsule slightly more
than an inch long and less than half an inch wide, is intended as a
less invasive way to examine the small intestine.
</P>
<P>
   The capsule has been successfully tested in animals and 10
healthy human volunteers. More human trials will be conducted as
the company, Given Imaging of Yokneam, Israel, seeks approval from
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Company officials said that
the cost of an examination using the capsule should be about the
same as a conventional endoscopic procedure.
</P>
<P>
   But the new device may be more effective, and will certainly be
more comfortable. Examination of the small intestine, particularly
the lower two-thirds, is difficult using fiber-optic or video
scopes that have long cables that must be snaked into the digestive
tract through the mouth or nose. The procedure usually requires
that the patient be sedated.
</P>
<P>
   The camera-in-a-pill ``can go some places we have trouble
going,'' said Dr. James Frakes, a gastroenterologist in Rockford,
Ill., and president of the American Society for Gastrointestinal
Endoscopy, who saw a demonstration of the device last week.
</P>
<P>
   The camera takes and transmits several images per second, which
are picked up by an array of flexible antennas and a receiver about
the size of a personal stereo that are attached to a special belt.
The images are stored in memory chips and then downloaded to a
computer for viewing, either as still pictures or as a kind of home
movie.
</P>
<P>
   The system uses the strength and phase of the signal received by
the antennas to track the pill so that the doctor can know
approximately where in the digestive tract a particularly image was
taken. So a surgeon, for example, would know where along the small
intestine to operate to repair or remove a source of bleeding, a
common and often vexing gastrointestinal problem.
</P>
<P>
   The batteries last for about six hours, enough time for the
capsule to make it through the small intestine, propelled by the
natural contractions known as peristalsis. Patients do not have to
interrupt their daily routines during the 24 to 48 hours the pills
are in their digestive tracts until excretion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once it's gone down, you don't feel it at all,'' said Dr. Paul
Swain, a gastroenterologist at the Royal London Hospital, who
conducted the initial trials of the device. The results were
reported last week in the journal Nature. The capsule is designed
to be disposable, said Swain, who has tried it himself.
</P>
<P>
   While Frakes said the images from the pill were not of the
quality that could be obtained with the latest generation of video
scopes, he described the demonstration, at a conference in San
Diego, as a ``landmark event.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It demonstrated that you could, in fact, do this,'' Frakes
said. ``The possibilities are limitless.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the device offers a taste of a future in which
molecular-scale sensors, pumps and other devices travel through the
body, diagnosing and repairing problems, something like the
shrunken submarine in the 1966 film ``Fantastic Voyage.'' The sub,
with Welch and others aboard, was injected into the bloodstream of
a gravely ill person, removed a blood clot with a laser and exited
through a tear duct (at the last second, in cliffhanger fashion).
</P>
<P>
   The camera-in-a-pill is not quite the stuff of Hollywood dreams,
obviously, and one drawback, as Swain pointed out, is that it
cannot do biopsies, cauterizations or other procedures that a
conventional endoscope can.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Richard Siegel, chairman of the materials science and
engineering department at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy,
N.Y., said the device was ``a very nice indication of where things
are beginning to go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you've had success, you're going to want to go on to the
next smaller thing, and the next smaller thing,'' said Siegel, who
headed a major study that helped lead to a recent proposal by the
Clinton administration to double federal spending on research into
molecular-scale devices, or nanotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   The new device is a descendant of swallowable capsules with
sensors and tiny radio transmitters that have been used for several
decades to diagnose stomach problems. Known as Heidelberg capsules,
they provide a record of stomach acidity during digestion.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Arkady Glukhovsky, vice president for research and
development with Given Imaging, said the new device was made
possible by several technological advances, including the
development of CMOS (pronounced SEE-moss) video imaging chips.
CMOS, or complementary metal-oxide semiconductor, chips, use far
less power than more conventional charge-coupled device chips. The
capsule also uses white-light emitting diodes as its light source.
Previously, LED's only produced colored light.
</P>
<P>
   The company is working to improve the image quality and the
battery life of the capsule, and to develop a model that will work
in the large intestine and colon, where more light is needed.
Researchers have also tested in animals a rudimentary method of
propulsion, in which a capsule with tiny electrodes fires a small
charge into the intestinal wall, prompting a contraction that
pushes the capsule up or down the tract.
</P>
<P>
   While it may be a forerunner of molecular-size devices, this
device probably will not get much tinier, Glukhovsky said.
``There's no point to make it smaller,'' he said. ``It should fit
the intestine.'' What is more likely is that the capsule will
eventually be able to repair problems as well as view them.
</P>
<P>
   That would reflect another trend in the development of
nanotechnology, Siegel said. ``The total package may not want to be
small,'' he said, ``but it may be packed with more and more power
to do things.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but Glukhovsky stressed that such multipurpose
micromachines were far in the future. As for his company's pill, he
said, ``If it's a beginning in that direction, it's a very early
beginning.''

<P>
   MEANS-COLUMN _ By forcefully supporting the Republican Party's
current anti-abortion plank, Texas Gov. George W. Bush may have
avoided another bitter abortion fight at the convention. He
stressed his capitulation to the GOP's far right during a joint
appearance last week with Gen. Colin Powell, who is mentioned as a
possible secretary of state but who would like to remove the plank.
This means that moderates who had hoped for a more tolerant
position on abortion at the July convention might as well give up
now. By MARIANNE MEANS.

 &HT;    RELEASED, BUT WOUNDS FROM NOTORIOUS PRISON HARD TO HEAL

   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ While her nation rejoices, Cosette Ibrahim
tries to piece together a life interrupted by the most notorious
element of Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Nine months ago, the promising journalism student was
inexplicably snatched from her house by the South Lebanon Army, the
Israeli-allied militia.
</P>
<P>
   They took the young Lebanese woman to the Al-Khiam prison. It
sits high on a hill wrapped in walls and rolls of barbed wire, but
was the dungeon of the occupation.
</P>
<P>
   There, Ibrahim faced a month of interrogations and beatings, and
eight more months of incarceration. Like the other prisoners, she
had no trial or lawyers. ``Here,'' she said her captors told her,
``You defend yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, as the SLA and Israel gave up their two-decade
occupation, nearby residents cut open the locks of the prison,
setting Ibrahim and about 140 other inmates free.
</P>
<P>
   The prison is open to inspection now. Its cells, originally
built as horse stables by the French in 1933, are strewn with the
old clothes, books and wall graffiti of the prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The corduroy hoods that prisoners were forced to wear litter the
courtyard between the small, detached cellblocks. Solitary cells,
about the size of a large closet, sit locked and dank.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups say that at least four prisoners died in
Al-Khiam since 1985, when the SLA began using the prison. Torture
included beatings, dowsings with freezing and scalding water, and
electric shock. Rights advocates have called for both Israel and
Lebanon to prosecute those who violated human rights in Al-Khiam,
and in general.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon now celebrates the end of the Israeli occupation _ and
the disintegration and flight of the SLA. Ibrahim is bitter and
tired.
</P>
<P>
   Seated at a Beirut cafe on Friday, the tired 25-year-old began
her mission to describe conditions in the prison. It was just three
days after her release and her tension and exhaustion were still
evident. Ulcers she had before were aggravated by the prison stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I feel,'' she said. ``In the end, I was
happy that I was released, but I am shocked at some of the things
they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials said the prison was run independently by the
SLA. But, the SLA was paid, trained and supplied by the Israeli
government _ and Israel's overall control seems clear.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli human rights group B'Tselem(CQ) notes that Israel
ordered 50 inmates released from the prison in 1998 to trade for
the body of a dead Israeli soldier held by Hezbollah guerrillas.
Israelis made frequent visits to the jail to pay the guards and
sometimes dropped off prisoners there.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim is Christian and the SLA was lead by Christians. She
said that, and the international attention her case received, won
her ``lenient'' treatment compared to the Muslim prisoners around
here.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim was a graduate student from a town in the occupation
area, about an hour from the prison. She had written articles
against Israel and the occupation in her university newspaper and
she had a brother-in-law involved in one of the resistance groups.
Otherwise, she can think of no reason she was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Her first day, Ibrahim was interrogated for five hours, with a
hood over her head. Two men took turns hitting and kicking her,
while the 120-pound woman was handcuffed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, 'We're not going to tell you what it is, but you
have something to tell us and you know what it is,''' she recalls.
</P>
<P>
   She was one of four women in the prison. They were forced to
submit to medical exams that prison officials said were meant to
show if they were virgins. They claimed it would be used to refute
any claims of rape later.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim said one inmate was raped repeatedly while she was
there.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim passed time reading books provided by the International
Committee of the Red Cross. She said she distrusted the Old
Testament and its description of the Jews as ``chosen'' by God.
</P>
<P>
   Her cell, a square room about 12 feet across that she shared
with three others, was open last week. Ibrahim's pencil-drawn
self-portrait was on the wall, with her inscription in French,
``Sometimes it is easier to dream life than to live it.''

PUTIN VS. CLINTON: AMEND, WITHDRAW OR ABROGATE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 4)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``A parley at the summit'' was what Winston Churchill called for
a half-century ago. He envisioned an intimate get-together of a few
world leaders and not a paperbound conference ``zealously contested
by hordes of experts and officials drawn up in a vast cumbrous
array.''
</P>
<P>
   This week's scheduled summit in Moscow between Vladimir Putin
and Bill Clinton would not be to Churchill's taste; hordes drawn up
in a vast cumbrous array (what a mouth-filling derogation of staff)
will be whispering in summiteers' ears.
</P>
<P>
   Whoops! In referring to what is universally being called the
upcoming (that is, forthcoming) summit, I have transgressed. ``As a
noun,'' reads the ordinarily sensible New York Times Manual of
Style and Usage, `` &UR; summit &LR;  may designate the level or format of a
meeting ( &UR; the issue will go to the summit &LR; ) but is jargon when used
as a synonym for  &UR; meeting &LR;  ( &UR; they held a summit &LR; ).''
</P>
<P>
   As they say in the Pentagon, I nonconcur. ( &UR; That's &LR;  jargon.) The
stylist's resistance to linguistic change is laudable _ new terms
should have to fight their way into general acceptance over time _
but players in the poker game that is language have to know when to
hold 'em and when to fold 'em.  &UR; Summit &LR;  is no longer merely an
attributive noun modifying  &UR; meeting &LR;  or  &UR; conference &LR; ; usage over 50
years has turned the modifier into that top-level conclave itself.
Cancel the  &UR; meeting &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   With that settled (at least in my mind), we can turn to this
week's summit in Moscow and diplomacy's fierce struggle of verbs
about a controversial arms control treaty:  &UR; abrogate &LR;  vs.
 &UR; withdraw &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, the general secretary of the Soviet Union's Communist
Party, Leonid Brezhnev, and President Richard Nixon signed a treaty
to limit anti-ballistic missile systems. The ABM treaty, in its
Article XV, says, ``Each Party shall, in exercising its national
sovereignty, have the right to  &UR; withdraw &LR;  from this Treaty if it
decides that extraordinary events ... have jeopardized its supreme
interests.'' Six months' notice is to be given ``prior to
 &UR; withdrawal &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Hard-liners in the United States point to a new missile threat
from rogue nations, learnedly mutter  &UR; rebus sic santibus &LR;  _
``circumstances have changed'' _ and add that the Soviet signatory
of 1972 no longer exists. Unless the Russians agree to let us build
a limited missile defense against a terrorist attack (a defense not
powerful enough to affect Russia's deterring missile forces), then
we should  &UR; withdraw &LR;  from the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Softer-liners counter that such unilateral action would
undermine all arms control; instead, they hope Clinton in Moscow
will seek minor amendments to the treaty to allow a limited U.S.
defense that would not cause the Russians to worry that their
missile force could be stopped. (I am being excruciatingly
evenhanded here.) They warn of a worldwide reaction against us if
the United States  &UR; abrogates &LR;  the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of verbs _  &UR; withdraw &LR;  or  &UR; abrogate &LR;  _ tips the reader
to the point of view.  &UR; Abrogate &LR;  means ``to cancel, annul, quash,
void, to abolish authoritatively.'' The word is harsh; in William
Tyndale's 1526 translation of the Epistle of Paul the Apostle to
the Hebrews, we see the controversial ``In that he sayth a new
testament he hath  &UR; abrogat &LR;  the olde.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Withdraw &LR; , in contrast, means ``to retract, to take back or
away'' or ``to remove''; in another sense, it means ``leave the
room.'' Robert Henryson, in his 1480 ``Testament of Cresseid,''
came up with a gentle line still remembered fondly by copy editors
afflicted with prolix writers: `` &UR; Withdraw &LR;  thy sentence, and be
gracious.''
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times editorial opined, ``Bush would  &UR; withdraw &LR;  loans
and credits to Russia over its crackdown in Chechnya and  &UR; abrogate &LR; 
the Anti-ballistic Missile Treaty.'' Though both steps would be
``dangerously confrontational'' in the newspaper's view, its use of
 &UR; withdraw &LR;  regarding loans and  &UR; abrogate &LR;  about the treaty suggests
that it would find the latter step more troubling.
</P>
<P>
   `` &UR; Abrogate &LR;  has a pejorative connotation,'' says Anne-Marie
Slaughter, a revered professor of international law at Harvard,
``in the sense that it means `to end the treaty not in accordance
with the treaty's terms.' It suggests a much more active decision
to end the treaty and is much closer to the term  &UR; breach &LR;  than the
term  &UR; withdraw &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Sen. Barry Goldwater had in mind when he took a case
against President Jimmy Carter to the Supreme Court, claiming the
president had unlawfully  &UR; abrogated &LR;  a treaty with Taiwan. In
turning down his appeal, the court avoided the hot verb and refused
to intervene in what it called Carter's  &UR; termination &LR;  of the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   At the current Moscow summit, the word  &UR; abrogate &LR;  is used by the
Clinton briefers only to say what they would not do and what the
Republicans might do. The GOP candidate, George W. Bush, last year
used the harsh word to indicate what he might be prepared to do,
but this year he has sidestepped the semantic trap, preferring
 &UR; withdraw &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Which verb will triumph? Keep your eye on a dark horse coming up
on the outside:  &UR; amend &LR; . If Clinton gets Putin to agree to change
the ABM treaty, he will declare success and send the amendments to
the Senate. In response, GOP leaders have already chosen a hospital
term to describe their reaction to any modest amending:  &UR; dead on
arrival &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ZEMBLANITY
</P>
<P>
   Arms controllers know that Russia has been setting off
non-nuclear explosions at its nuclear test facility on the barren,
frigid Arctic island of Nova Zembla, and thereby hangs a new word.
</P>
<P>
   An old word is  &UR; serendipity &LR; , ``a happy discovery by accident.''
It was coined by Horace Walpole in 1754, based on the fairy tale of
the three princes of Serendip, who ``were always making discoveries
... of things they were not in quest of.'' The Indian Ocean island
of Serendip, later known as Ceylon, is now the nation of Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times Book Review note about the novel ``Armadillo,''
by William Boyd, reads, ``The novel's hero ... is undone by an
outbreak of  &UR; zemblanity &LR; , the opposite of serendipity, in the
multicultural hubbub of Cool Britannia.'' Newton Scherl of
Englewood, N.J., writes, ``I have tried without success to find
 &UR; zemblanity &LR;  in any of my dictionaries.'' That's because it is not
yet there.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the opposite of Serendip, a southern land of spice and
warmth?'' asks Boyd in his novel. ``Think of another world in the
far north, barren, icebound ... Zembla. Ergo:  &UR; zemblanity &LR; , the
opposite of serendipity, the faculty of making unhappy, unlucky and
expected discoveries by design.''
</P>
<P>
   Writers from Jonathan Swift and Alexander Pope to Jules Verne
and Salman Rushdie have used Zembla's wastes north of Siberia as
symbolic of what Charlotte Bronte called ``forlorn regions of
dreary space.'' Now this site of testing of non-nuclear explosives
at a nuclear facility has given birth to  &UR; zemblanity &LR; , the
inexorable discovery of what we don't want to know.

LIONIZING 4 LITTLE-KNOWN WOMEN BEHIND THE LENS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Broadcast notes are at end of review. Time, station are for New

 By NEIL GENZLINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   So narrowly white-male is our perception of the past that it is
tempting to construct a Television Documentary Subject Generator,
one of those comic charts that would let a producer choose randomly
from Column A and Column B. ``Our documentary will explore the
long-overlooked role of
blacks/Asian-Americans/southpaws/vegetarians in Vietnam/early
baseball/medicine/the Industrial Revolution. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   That such programs have become somewhat formulaic is a good
thing; slowly, our view of who shaped today's world is being made
more inclusive. But with each revisionist nudge the bar gets
higher: The more sophisticated our view of the past becomes, the
more we demand from the revisionists.
</P>
<P>
   So ``Reel Models: The First Women of Film,'' Tuesday night's
historical corrective on AMC, has the burden of doing more than
simply telling us that women have been overlooked in the history of
cinema. Unfortunately the program seems content merely to identify
four female pioneers and gush about them.
</P>
<P>
   Barbra Streisand, executive producer of ``Reel Models'' with Cis
Corman, should know that achievement speaks for itself, but in her
earnest introduction she seems a little too eager to sell us on the
whole idea. And that tone lingers over the program as Shirley
MacLaine, Susan Sarandon, Hilary Swank and Minnie Driver narrate
segments on the four pioneers.
</P>
<P>
   First we hear about Alice Guy, an early director and producer
who made hundreds of short films in France and the United States
beginning in 1896. There is plenty to credit her for: realizing
very early the possibilities of close-ups and fade-outs; even
hand-tinting films long before color. Some of these things have
been erroneously credited to men who came later. But here as
elsewhere in this program there is a tendency to go overboard.
MacLaine, for instance, implies that Guy alone came up with the
concept of using film to tell a story rather than simply to record
real life; surely this was so obvious a step that it occurred
spontaneously to many who were there at cinema's creation.
</P>
<P>
   Sarandon tells of Lois Weber, who by 1916 was a top director at
Universal, making daring films on social themes like birth control
and child labor. She was a bit too committed to these subjects, as
it turned out; in the 1920s public taste took a mindless turn and
her films ceased to draw crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Swank introduces Frances Marion, a screenwriter who, we're told
in one of the program's funnier factoids, got her start writing
lines for extras to mouth in silent films in case anyone in the
audience could read lips. Here, though, the program veers from the
theme of women who did not get their due. Marion won Oscars in 1930
and 1931 and, as the program acknowledges, was the highest-paid
writer in Hollywood for years. There is a difference between being
disenfranchised and simply fading into history.
</P>
<P>
   Last, courtesy of Driver, comes Dorothy Arzner, a director who
gave Katharine Hepburn and other future legends their first
starring roles. She was, the show says, the only female director
who managed to find a place in Hollywood's studio system.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly ``Reel Models'' leaves no doubt that these four women
made major contributions (and some of their films will be shown on
AMC after the program). But it gives little sense of them as
people.
</P>
<P>
   Was Weber a domineering type of director or the kind who worked
collaboratively with her actors? Was Marion a brooding writer or a
zany, fun-loving one? The few times the program does provide
personal glimpses it gets timid. After hearing Guy and Weber
portrayed as strong, accomplished women, we are told that they both
basically fell apart when their husbands left them; the incongruity
is left unexplored.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the program commits what is surely a cardinal sin in
Streisand's book: It puts the four women on pedestals. They don't
have any flaws; no one is that wonderful.

SILENT CAL'S HOME SPEAKS VOLUMES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: S.D., Vt., Mass.)   (Editors: a 250-word box appears at end of story.)  
 (For release Sunday, June 4)

<TEXT>
<P>
   For anyone weary of the glitz and spin of modern presidential
campaigns and longing for a quieter time when American presidents
wore hats and spared the electorate their confessions, it may be
time to repair, as my wife, Jaqueline, and I did, to Plymouth
Notch, the Vermont birthplace and home of Silent Cal, as Calvin
Coolidge was nicknamed by contemporaries.
</P>
<P>
   Coolidge, the 30th president of the United States, said he could
not recall that any presidential candidate hurt himself much by not
talking. When a woman bet a friend that she could pry more than two
words out of Coolidge, he told her, ``You lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Stories about Coolidge and his thrifty, taciturn clan abound in
Plymouth Notch, a community of tidy white clapboard farmhouses and
weathered barns that look unchanged since Coolidge was sworn in
here as president in 1923. That's another good reason to visit
Plymouth Notch, for it is a near-perfect model of a Vermont village
almost a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated in the rugged heartland of the Green Mountains,
Plymouth Notch has been called Vermont's Brigadoon, after the
imaginary Scottish village that appears and vanishes in the mists.
Because the major highways and their attendant filling stations,
convenience stores and strip malls bypassed Plymouth Notch, it
never needed restoration, explained William Jenney, a museum
historian who administers the Calvin Coolidge State Historic Site
on behalf of the Vermont Division for Historic Preservation. ``The
village was not restored, but preserved,'' Jenney said.
</P>
<P>
   Nestled in a pocket of farmland under a panorama of wooded hills
rising to 2,200 feet, Plymouth Notch is accessible by Route 100A, a
secondary road winding between the resort towns of Ludlow and
Woodstock in the ski country of central Vermont. Plymouth Notch can
be seen in two hours or less, but it would be a shame to leave
before lingering for a picnic and a walk along trails through the
meadows.
</P>
<P>
   Jaqueline and I cheated on the recommended itinerary for
Plymouth Notch by driving directly to the final stop: the cemetery
containing the graves of six generations of Coolidges, including
the president. The grassy cemetery, typical of Vermont, was carved
into a hillside too steep for farming. Coolidge was one of two
American presidents born in Vermont (Chester Arthur was the other),
yet Coolidge's gravesite modestly omits any mention of his five and
a half years in the White House, noting merely his birth on July 4,
1872, and death on Jan. 5, 1933. The only clue is a small
presidential seal etched into the granite headstone. Beside him lie
his wife, Grace Anne Goodhue, from Burlington, Vt., and his younger
son, Calvin Jr., whose premature death from blood poisoning at age
16 in 1924 plunged the president into depression.
</P>
<P>
   The road that Coolidge traveled from Plymouth Notch to the White
House led through Massachusetts: he graduated from Amherst College
and became a lawyer in Northampton, where he was elected mayor. His
political career took him to the state legislature and the
governor's mansion. In 1921, he moved to Washington as vice
president in the new Republican administration of Warren G.
Harding.
</P>
<P>
   From the cemetery, we drove through the village and passed Piney
Hollow Brook, which was stocked with trout to assure a catch
whenever Coolidge went fishing on his summer holidays. When a
stranger was spotted angling in the brook, Coolidge reportedly
dispatched his Secret Service men to retrieve the catch. ``Those
are my fish,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of Plymouth Notch is the Coolidge Homestead, a
two-story clapboard house where time has been wound back to 2:47
a.m. on Aug. 3, 1923. That was when Coolidge was sworn in as
president by his father, a notary public, by the glow of a kerosene
lamp, after word of Harding's death arrived from San Francisco.
When John Coolidge was asked later about his authority to
administer the presidential oath, he said, ``I didn't know that I
couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after Coolidge became president, his father put off
installing electric lights in the homestead because his
housekeeper, Aurora Pierce, distrusted electricity, fearing that it
would burn the place down. A tour of the homestead offers other
intriguing windows on rural life in old Vermont: a sturdy antique
sleigh in the horse barn; an 1838 poster in the tool room
advertising ``gargling oil'' for horses; the kitchen where the
family ate (Calvin's only sibling, Abigail, died at 15, his mother
when he was 12), and where Calvin and his father shaved from water
heated on the wood stove.
</P>
<P>
   Aldrich House, around the corner, belonged to Ruth Aldrich, the
daughter of the village's first cheesemaker. Hand-wrought nails and
other early hardware date the original house to the 1820s. The age
of old Vermont houses, we learned, tends to be imprecise, because
the ``continuous'' style of New England architecture involves the
adding on of barns, chicken coops and other outbuildings to avoid
stepping outside in snow and rain.
</P>
<P>
   In the house, we found plates and menus of the tearoom operated
by Aldrich, which she called Top of the Notch, an allusion to the
V-shaped valley leading up from Ludlow. She did the cooking with
the help of two girls, serving deviled ham sandwiches for 20 cents
and creamed chicken on toast for 50 cents, catering to the summer
White House staff, reporters and tourists. Coolidge ate chicken
dinners for $1 in an adjacent private dining room, which was
converted into a bathroom in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   Aldrich also kept a diary. ``Had a great crew for breakfast,''
notes one entry posted in the dining room. ``Fed a great many. Have
15 secret service men.''
</P>
<P>
   When it came time to put Miss Aldrich's house in condition for
visitors, a closet yielded a score of woven Abenaki Indian baskets
intended for sale. Folks in Plymouth Notch seemed to save
everything, down to brown paper bags and string in the kitchen
drawers. The Coolidge family donated many of the president's more
valuable objects on display.
</P>
<P>
   Before air-conditioning made Washington bearable in the summer,
the president and Congress fled the heat and humidity for cooler
climes like Plymouth Notch, where Coolidge's summer White House
administrative staff in 1924 consisted of two: a secretary and a
stenographer, both men. Compare this with the retinues that dance
attendance on a president nowadays.
</P>
<P>
   We paused to watch an old Pathe newsreel reporting silently on
Coolidge's return to Plymouth Notch in the summer of 1924. It
included footage of the president, deadpan as ever, deftly
gathering hay with a pitchfork, and of four eminent visitors, Henry
Ford, Harvey and Russell Firestone and Thomas Edison.
</P>
<P>
   Coolidge's summer office can be found in the community hall, an
austere room with vaulted ceiling and plank floors on the second
floor above the general store. Telegraph and telephone lines were
brought in to keep the president in touch with the rest of the
country. The hall also contained a piano and other musical
instruments played by the Plymouth Old Time Dance Orchestra, which
traveled to Washington in 1926 to serenade Coolidge.

PLYMOUTH NOTCH, Vt.: serenade Coolidge.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The general store has a wood counter built by Calvin Coolidge
and his father in 1890 from bird's-eye maple and cherry. The
store's top shelves display goods available in 1923. Lower shelves
offer handcrafts made in Vermont for sale today. We saw painted
birdhouses, wooden toys and a child's red sled, but my favorite,
for $16.50, was a bell sewn on leather to wear during hikes to shoo
away bears. The store's filigreed antique cash register no longer
rings up sales because it can't compute Vermont's 5 percent sales
tax.
</P>
<P>
   The Plymouth Cheese Factory down the street still produces
granular curd cheese made from an old recipe. The factory, which
Coolidge's father helped start in 1890, was purchased last year by
the state of Vermont and will reopen to tourists this month
following interior repairs. Across the street, the steepled Union
Christian Church, first built in 1840, is open to the public for
services on the first Sunday morning of each month. It has also
become popular for weddings.
</P>
<P>
   There is more to see. The Wilder Barn, thought to date back to
about 1875, holds a marvelous collection of horse-drawn wagons and
old farming implements. Wilder House, once a 19th-century tavern
where Calvin Coolidge's grandmother lived as a child, has a summer
cafe offering light breakfasts and lunches.
</P>
<P>
   In 1926, Plymouth had 29 residents. The population has grown to
about 450 today, including the adjacent communities of Plymouth
Union and Tyson. Plymouth Notch draws about 40,000 tourists a year.
Many come to view the flaming foliage of the Vermont autumn; the
village is seldom crowded in early summer. Still, back in the
1920s, when Coolidge's home village seized the public's curiosity,
an estimated 10,000 visitors showed up one summer day to see him,
judging by a rough count of 4,000 to 5,000 parked cars.
</P>
<P>
   We left Plymouth Notch feeling that Coolidge deserves more
credit than history accords. When Coolidge occupied the White
House, more than 90 percent of Americans paid no federal taxes, yet
he trimmed the national debt by a third. Although renowned for
keeping his mouth shut, Coolidge held regular news conferences and
he delivered more speeches than any of his 29 presidential
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   When his elected term ended, Coolidge returned quietly to
private life, having declared, ``I do not choose to run for
president in 1928.'' The homespun philosopher Will Rogers caught
the spirit of Plymouth Notch when he told Coolidge, ``You put horse
sense into statemanship.''
</P>
<P>
   TURNING BACK THE CLOCK
</P>
<P>
   It is best to begin a visit to Plymouth Notch at the visitors
center, the town's only new structure, built in 1972 in the form of
an early Vermont stone house. Admission to its exhibits and other
buildings around the village costs $6. Children under 14 get in
free. For information, contact President Calvin Coolidge State
Historic Site, Post Office Box 247, Plymouth, Vt. 05056; (802)
672-3773; www.historicermont.org.
</P>
<P>
   From May 27 to Oct. 15, the Coolidge historic site opens 10
buildings to the public every day, generally from 9:30 a.m. to 5
p.m. Coolidge's birthday is celebrated on July 4, with a procession
to the cemetery. On July 15 and 16, there will be a show of antique
gas and steam engines. Plymouth Old Home Day on Aug. 5 will feature
a chicken barbecue and bake sale and, in the evening, fireworks and
a concert by the Vermont Symphony Orchestra. The village's cheese
and harvest festival comes on Sept. 9.
</P>
<P>
   A summerlong exhibit of artifacts and graphics will look at
other summer retreats used by Coolidge, including places in
Swampscott, Mass., and Rapid City, S.D. Fishing equipment used by
the president and some fine examples of American Indian beadwork
will be among the items.
</P>
<P>
   There is an on-site restaurant, serving lunch, and the adjacent
Wilder House, offers a light breakfast and lunch from 10 a.m. to 3
p.m., featuring homemade muffins and country fare like chicken pot
pie. Lunch for two costs about $14. Information: Echo Lake Inn,
(800) 356-6844.

NEURAL CELLS, GROWN IN LABS, RAISE HOPES ON BRAIN DISEASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
 By ANDREW POLLACK    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sylvia Elam saw the benefits of her operation as soon as she was
wheeled into the recovery room and ate lunch. For the first time in
years, she could taste the food.
</P>
<P>
   After a stroke in 1993, Elam, of Scottsdale, Ariz., lost most of
the movement and sensation on her right side. But last year she
became one of the first people in the world to have cells
manufactured in a laboratory implanted into her brain. The implant
enabled Elam, now 66, to talk again without stammering, to throw a
ball with her right arm, to walk somewhat without a cane and even
to drive a car.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was absolutely beyond our wildest dreams,'' said Elam's
husband, Ira.
</P>
<P>
   Not all cases have had such positive results, but hope is
growing that neural cells implanted into the brain can replace
damaged cells and restore functions lost to stroke, spinal cord
injury or neurological diseases like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's,
most of which have no effective treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like reseeding your lawn,'' said Dr. Evan Snyder,
a neurologist at Children's Hospital in Boston and at Harvard
Medical School, who has successfully used the technique to treat
rats with a disease similar to multiple sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   In Elam's case, a few months after the operation she suffered
setbacks as a result of a second, apparently unrelated, stroke.
</P>
<P>
   The quest to restore the neural connections in the brain has
been spurred by two recent scientific developments. One was the
isolation of so-called stem cells, the primordial cells from which
all others evolve, that can potentially be made into neural cells
for transplantation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, in tests conducted in animals, the cells have had
the ability to migrate through the brain to where they are needed
to repair damage.
</P>
<P>
   A second development was the discovery that adult brains
continue to produce new cells, overturning conventional wisdom that
brain cells are not replenished. This suggests some capacity for
nervous system regeneration.
</P>
<P>
   The discoveries have set off a race by companies hoping to
develop cells to be sold for neural transplantation, part of the
larger field of regenerative medicine. But harnessing such cells
will require negotiating a minefield not only of technical
challenges but of ethical ones, since most stem cells come from
either embryos discarded by fertility clinics or aborted fetuses.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists and business executives worry that the neural
implant field will repeat the history of gene therapy, which has
gone through 10 years of largely dashed hopes, controversial
clinical trials and burned investors, though there have been some
recent signs of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would do well to learn the lesson from the troubled path of
the gene therapy field: not to promise too much too early,'' wrote
Anders Bjorklund and Olle Lindvall, Swedish scientists, in a
commentary in the June issue of Nature Neuroscience.
</P>
<P>
   They said they see signs of a rush toward ``ill-founded clinical
trials'' without adequate scientific rationale.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the two scientists have been implanting brain tissue from
aborted human fetuses into the brains of people with Parkinson's
disease, which causes a loss of motor skills, for almost a decade.
In some patients the treatment has caused a slight improvement in
motor control, which has lasted 5 to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   But such treatment, which has also been done in this country,
requires several fetuses for each patient. Moral questions
notwithstanding, there are simply not enough fetuses to treat this
nation's million or more Parkinson's patients.
</P>
<P>
   So scientists are searching for cells that can be mass produced
_ ``neurons in a bottle,'' said George W. Dunbar Jr., acting chief
executive officer of StemCells Inc., in Sunnyvale, Calif., one of
the companies pursuing the treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The cells implanted in Elam were supplied by Layton BioScience
Inc., also of Sunnyvale, and derived from testicular cancer cells
isolated from a patient in the 1970s. Scientists found, almost
serendipitously, that when treated with chemicals called retinoids,
some of the cells turned into neural cells. Six of the 12 stroke
patients treated with the cells had some improvement in motor
skills, said Dr. John Kondziolka, the University of Pittsburgh
neurosurgeon who performed the operations.
</P>
<P>
   Similar hints of success have been found in clinical trials run
by Diacrin Inc. of Charlestown, Mass., the company furthest along
in neural cell implants. It harvests brain cells from pig fetuses,
which have been used to treat more than 20 Parkinson's patients and
several with stroke, Huntington's disease and epilepsy.
</P>
<P>
   But there are fears the cancer-derived cells could cause cancer
and that cells from pigs could infect patients with animal viruses.
</P>
<P>
   Diacrin recently suspended its trials on stroke victims after
two of five patients suffered seizures, though the company does not
think the pig cells were the cause. While Layton and Diacrin say
their cells are safe, some experts think they will eventually be
replaced by alternatives that are less unappealing to patients.
</P>
<P>
   That would mean human stem cells, which can be grown in great
quantities. The greatest excitement revolves around so-called
embryonic stem cells, which were first isolated in 1998 by Dr.
James Thomson of the University of Wisconsin. These cells can turn
into virtually any cell in the body _ including the liver, kidney,
blood or heart, as well as neurons.
</P>
<P>
   But such cells are at the center of an ethical controversy, with
opponents saying it is immoral to use embryos for medical purposes.
By law, federal money cannot be used for research involving the
destruction of embryos.
</P>
<P>
   The National Institutes of Health has proposed new guidelines to
allow scientists receiving its money to work with the cells,
provided that the cells are created with private money.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, have
proposed a bill that would ease the restrictions. But abortion
opponents remain opposed to any such relaxation.
</P>
<P>
   The research ban does not affect scientists with corporate
financing, which has allowed companies to dominate the field.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Geron Corp. of Menlo Park, Calif., which financed the work at
Wisconsin, has commercial rights to the embryonic stem cells. It
also has the patent rights to a similar type of primordial cell
isolated by Dr. John Gearhart of Johns Hopkins University, also
with Geron financing.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies, looking to sidestep both Geron's patents and
the ethical issues surrounding embryonic cells, are using so-called
neural stem cells on which they have obtained patents. These are
less versatile than embryonic stem cells. They can turn into
different types of neural cells but probably not into others, like
kidney or liver cells.
</P>
<P>
   But those working with neural stem cells say that might even be
an advantage for treating a neurological disease. Embryonic stem
cells ``turn into bone cells and knee cells,'' said I. Richard
Garr, president and chief executive of NeuralStem
Biopharmaceuticals Ltd. of College Park, Md. ``You can't put them
in a person's head without being 100 percent sure they won't turn
into these other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas Okarma, president and chief executive of Geron,
countered that embryonic cells could more easily be multiplied and
made to live forever than the neural stem cells, providing an
endless supply. ``The more upstream you start, the more total
control,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In neural stem cells, NeuralStem is competing with StemCells
Inc., a publicly traded company that was known as CytoTherapeutics
Inc. until it abandoned its previous business to focus on stem
cells. Layton, which made the cells used on Elam, has now also
moved into neural stem cells by obtaining from Children's Hospital
in Boston a license for a line of cells developed by Snyder.
</P>
<P>
   The other companies also have strong scientific credentials.
NeuralStem was founded by scientists from the National Institutes
of Health laboratory of Dr. Ronald McKay, a pioneer in neural stem
cells.
</P>
<P>
   StemCells counts among its scientific advisers Dr. Irving
Weissman, a stem cell expert at Stanford, and Dr. Fred Gage of the
Salk Institute for Biological Sciences, who made some of the
crucial discoveries that the adult brain can grow new cells.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies in the emerging field include ReNeuron Ltd. in
London and Neuronyx of Malvern, Pa., which is headed by Hubert
Schoemaker, the former chief executive of Centocor, a leading
biotechnology company now owned by Johnson &AMP; Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The neural stem cells are not free of ethical controversy, since
they generally come from fetuses. But the companies say that since
they can multiply the cells in the laboratory, they might need only
a single fetus to supply hundreds of patients, if not the entire
world demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had to go back to human fetal material on a continuing
basis, that would be a concern,'' said Gary Snabel, president and
chief executive of Layton. But with only a few fetuses needed for
all time, ``most people would say that's not an unreasonable
strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent discoveries that adult brains still contain some stem
cells makes it possible to derive such cells from adults, which
would remove the ethical questions. But the scientists say the
fetal cells are easier to obtain and easier to grow and that adult
stem cells might lack the resiliency of the embryonic or fetal
ones.
</P>
<P>
   There are still many technical problems to overcome with both
neural stem cells and embryonic stem cells, and it could be several
years before clinical trials begin.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge is trying to get the stem cells to
reliably turn into a single desired type of cell, which is usually
done by exposing the cells to certain growth factors or implanting
particular genes in them. This cannot be done yet for embryonic
stem cells, though there has been progress.
</P>
<P>
   McKay of the health institutes has turned mouse embryonic stem
cells into neural cells that produce dopamine, the chemical lacking
in patients with Parkinson's.
</P>
<P>
   Another approach is to use drugs to try to stimulate the brain
to grow its own new cells.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Tracy, publisher of Neuroinvestment, an investment
newsletter in Rye, N.H., that follows the neurological medicine
companies, said some of the drugs might reach the market before
stem cell implants. Still, he said, a combination of both
approaches would probably be needed.

`CLERKS': SLACKERS, NOW ANIMATED, IN COLOR AND A WEE BIT CUTE 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: Production notes at end of review.) 
 BY DAVID DEWITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you know something about ``The People's Court,'' Korean
animation, NBA players or the movie ``Fast Times at Ridgemont
High,'' you might find something good for a giggle _ or at least a
knowing smile _ in the premiere of ``Clerks,'' an animated series
based on Kevin Smith's 1994 film.
</P>
<P>
   You might also shrug your shoulders, wondering how the film's
uncompromised slacker characters have gone from fresh and real to
cutesy and flat in their journey from a low-budget, black-and-white
film to a higher-budget network show.
</P>
<P>
   Since ABC's ``Clerks'' can't really ape the movie _ which is a
different animal, after all _ it sensibly looks to ``The Simpsons''
(with its relaxed zingers that scatter layers of subversive humor)
and ``South Park'' (with its strange little universe that skewers
ours). ``Clerks'' is after similar territory, but it seems
desperate to be clever, with ideas from hither and yon and
whatever's nearby bearing down hard on the show's setting: a New
Jersey Quick Stop and its neighbor, RTV Video.
</P>
<P>
   The show's blend of familiar elements is its most successful
conceit. The title characters, Dante and Randal, may be convenience
store clerks, but they also star in their own pop cartoon and thus
mix with the pop culture that swamps their town of Leonardo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clerks'' can be inventive, and its star voices, Brian
O'Halloran and Jeff Anderson (in reprises of their film roles),
adjust well to the cartoon universe. But the humor rarely feels
organic, and its reach seems far less successful in the remaining
episodes that were made available for preview. The jokes at the
expense of gays and blacks aren't really offensive; they're just
dull. Well, a jokey look at the Challenger explosion isn't dull;
you can make your own decision about its merits.
</P>
<P>
   This series could be more interesting if it trusted its
potential. Think of it: Two cartoon clerks keep encountering the
pop culture that overwhelms their lives, with a biting,
class-conscious interchange. Could be good. Could be funny.
</P>
<P>
   But not if Dante and Randal are going to battle the town's
cliched billionaire and a bunch of unhealthy Arab children. In an
analysis of funny, such scenes have their own category: not.
</P>
<P>
   So we have another show for adolescent males. Go for it, guys.
This one's all yours.

ARMOR IN PHILADELPHIA IS RETURNED TO DRESDEN 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an unusually collaborative act of restitution, the
Philadelphia Museum of Art and the State Art Collections in
Dresden, Germany, were to announce Tuesday that five works of armor
that entered the Philadelphia collection in 1977 had been returned
to the State Art Collections, which claimed ownership of the pieces
five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than just having the Philadelphia museum return the rare
ceremonial armor, the agreement between the institutions provides
for a series of exchange loans, including three major examples of
armor from Dresden that have just been put on display in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The Dresden museums have also agreed to let four colletins, or
neck defenses, made for Johann Georg and other Electors of Saxony,
remain in Philadelphia through 2004 before being returned to
Dresden.
</P>
<P>
   The Dresden museums will also lend three other pieces from their
collection to Philadelphia through 2004: field armor, gilded
tournament armor, and a shield matching an armor in Philadelphia
used for jousts celebrating the marriage of Prince Elector Frederic
August II of Saxony to Archduchess Marie Josephe of Austria.
</P>
<P>
   In return the Philadelphia Museum will lend Dresden five
paintings from its collection: Courbet's ``Waves,'' Cassatt's
``Woman With a Pearl Necklace in Loge,'' Monet's ``Morning Haze,''
Braque's ``Still Life With Fruit Dish'' and Matisse's ``Still Life
on a Table.'' The Matisse will go to Dresden for five years, and
the other paintings for six months.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 the Dresden museums formally requested the return of
five works of armor. After studying their provenance, the
Philadelphia concluded that they had been put on the market without
the knowledge of the State Art Collections, museum officials said.
Originally part of the armory of the Electors of Saxony, the pieces
disappeared from a remote storage site to which they had been sent
by the Dresden museums for safekeeping during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1950s the objects were on the open market. They
were purchased by Carl Otto Kretzschmar von Kienbusch, an
internationally known collector who bequeathed his entire
collection of arms and armor to the Philadelphia Museum in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy with the loans because we've made a good
relationship with a distinguished museum,'' said Anne
d'Harnoncourt, director and chief executive of the Philadelphia
Museum. She said that the idea of exchanges had grown out of years
of discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Museums are born to collaborate with each other,'' she added.
``We all have the same mission: to connect great works of art with
our public.''

 &HT;    Coca-Cola plaintiffs delay filing key brief
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With settlement talks under way, plaintiffs' attorneys
are not going to file an important document by today's deadline in
the racial discrimination lawsuit against Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't talk about the settlement talks, but I can confirm
that tomorrow we are not going to file the class certification
brief, and I cannot say anything more at this time,'' plaintiffs'
attorney Cyrus Mehri said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The federal judge in the case is likely to grant a two-week
extension to give negotiators more time to try to reach a
settlement, according to former Coke manager Larry Jones, who is
the chief organizer of a boycott of company products aimed at
pressuring it to settle the suit.
</P>
<P>
   The class certification brief is a key document in the case.
</P>
<P>
   In it, plaintiffs' attorneys are supposed to lay out a detailed
analysis of why they believe the case should be expanded from four
plaintiffs to include about 2,000 current and former black
employees in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The suit alleges that the company has discriminated against
African-Americans in pay, promotions and performance evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has denied the allegations, would be able to
respond to the certification brief if it eventually gets filed.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones said the settlement talks, which are being facilitated
by a mediator, apparently have become a priority. Attorneys for
both sides are prohibited from publicly talking about the
settlement negotiations, which began in mid-April. They can,
however, talk about the filing of legal briefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I understand the reason for the delay is that both
parties want to continue mediation without the motion being
filed,'' said Jones, who was laid off as a human resources manager
in February. ``However, I am deeply concerned that this is simply
another delaying tactic by Coca-Cola Co.''
</P>
<P>
   Coke, which declined comment Monday, has repeatedly said it
wants a speedy and fair settlement. And the delay in filing the
class certification brief could not have happened without
plaintiffs' attorneys agreeing to it in hopes of making more
progress at the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   But the issues are complex. They include a possible monetary
settlement for the plaintiffs and the prospective class members, as
well as proposed changes in the company's diversity practices.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said his group will be protesting outside Coca-Cola's
headquarters this morning.

 &HT;    Away from politics, Gingrich takes on the world of technology
 &HT;    By Maria Saporta
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tucked away in a back offfice in the
PriceWaterhousCoopers space of the Wildwood office park one can
find Newt Gingrich the businessman hard at work.
</P>
<P>
   It's far from the pomp and circumstance of Washington D.C. where
at one time Gingrich commanded the center of the country as Speaker
of the House and architect of the Republican takeover of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gingrich's mind is as active as ever. Over the course of an
hour-and-a-half, Gingrich has mapped out a historical model of
technology and economic forces in the past century and foreshadowed
how he sees the next 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a scale of total change,'' Gingrich said. ``We will
experience as much development in technology in the next 25 years
as we did in the last 100. You will never stop this age of
transition.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich talks about S curves, carbon nanotubes, hydrogen fuel
cells and solar energy, explaining complex concepts, much as a
professor would talk to a student. He then applies his ideas to
education, public policy, the Internet and, more importantly, their
implications for business.
</P>
<P>
   Just over a year ago, Gingrich jumpstarted the Gingrich Group, a
management consulting firm that specializes in new technology and
its applications to society. He works with both the companies
offering technological advances and enterprises that can take
advantage of those new developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Picking and choosing is one our biggest challenges,'' Gingrich
said. ``I look for two things when considering clients. I want a
dramatic decline in cost or a dramatic increase in capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   He receives consulting fees and ``success fees.'' But he takes
no fees from the U.S. government or for lobbying. He doesn't serve
on any company's board of directors, preferring a role as an
advisor to enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   His client list includes NetSchools, an Atlanta-based company
that offers a combination of laptop computers for students to use
at home and at school, access to the Internet and links between the
student and a school's computer system _ primarily in low-income
areas. Because Gingrich is such a believer in NetSchools, he
accepts no fees from them.
</P>
<P>
   Other clients are: Intelysys, a New York-based company that
developers online software for business purchases over the
Internet; InsiderAdvantage.com, a 50-state website for information
on business opportunities and political knowledge; MindArrow, a
Silicon Valley company that provides interactive sales and
marketing for the Internet; AcclerateIT.com, now called World2One,
a Norcross-based Internet company specializing in electronic
business cards; and Uniscape, a Redwood Shores, Ca. company that
provides business to business translations in multitude of
languages allowing people of all languages to interact with the
same site.
</P>
<P>
   He has a strong association as a consultant with
PriceWaterhouseCoopers, and he also is on the business advisory
board of Fleishman-Hillard, Forstmann-Little and Hollinger
International.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how being in business differs from his political career,
Gingrich is contemplative. ``Working with business is a lot
harder,'' he said. ``If you learn in an environment where you have
to make something work, it's a lot harder than having a theory.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gingrich is not your traditional businessman. He said that
about three-fourths of his consulting work he does for nothing. And
he spends at least half of his time learning. He will tour the
National Science Foundation, Georgia Tech, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, MIT, Stamford Medical School _ anywhere he
can learn about what is coming down the pipe in technology and the
transformation of society.
</P>
<P>
   Then he brings his learning to the Gingrich Group, which has a
total of five employees in two offices: Atlanta and Washington D.C.
While he wouldn't disclose his first year revenues, Gingrich said,
``We made a good profit. It's doing quite well.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Gingrich remains opinionated about the state of the
world and its future. He refers to claims that there are limits to
growth as ``garbage.'' For all practical purposes, we are 18 to 20
years away from hydrogen fuel cell technology, where hydrogen is
stored in carbon nanotubes _ ``100 times as strong has steel but
weighs one-sixth as much.'' The byproduct of hydrogen fuel cells is
not carbon monoxide, but water. ``You solve the water problem at
the same time,'' he said. ``It's just amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich also sounds little like a conservative Republican when
he calls for subsidies and universal coverage of the Internet to
every U.S. citizen. ``We are a rich enough country for every one to
have a computer. In six years, we need to have everyone
connected,'' he said. ``It is cheaper to give every four-year-old a
computer than to hire a Title One teacher or pay for prisons. I
list creating a digital connection as a top three national security
issue.'' (The other two are overhauling math and science education,
and dramatically increasing the federal government's research and
development budget.)
</P>
<P>
   It is obvious that Gingrich's mind has not stopped working when
he resigned from Congress in January, 1999. In his new role as
businessman/consultant, Gingrich does not fit a prepackaged mold.
And he seems even freer to take on independent public policy
positions. Take rural development.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to actively rethink the rural communities from an
Internet basis. We should wire every house and wire every
community,'' Gingrich said. ``People are big on concrete and
asphalt because that's where the lobbyists are. But the Internet
will provide distance learning, distance shopping, distance work
and distance health. It can transform our rural areas.''

 &HT;    AMB Property remains focused on Atlanta
 &HT;    By Tony Wilbert
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Despite the lure of seemingly unlimited land in
Atlanta's far-out suburbs, AMB Property Corp. sees no reason to
alter its Atlanta strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The company will continue to develop warehouse and distribution
center space in two submarkets, the I-85 corridor in Gwinnett
County and the area around Hartsfield Atlanta International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very focused,'' AMB Chairman and Chief Executive Hamid
Moghadam said during a recent visit to Buckhead. ``It's not like
we're randomly developing around Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   With a market capitalization of $1.84 billion, San
Francisco-based AMB ranks as the second-largest industrial real
estate investment trust in the country behind ProLogis Trust. AMB
entered the Atlanta market with a small presence in the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Atlanta is one of its six core markets. AMB has nearly
5.5 million square feet of space and is the largest owner of
industrial space in the airport submarket, Moghadam said. Southern
Co., at one time AMB's largest investor, remains a major
shareholder.
</P>
<P>
   The company has no employees in Atlanta. It prefers to develop
through alliances with local companies such as Seefried Properties
and Southeast Investment Properties.
</P>
<P>
   Moghadam knows that a competitor, Duke-Weeks Realty Corp., has
decided to follow I-85 into Hall and Jackson counties, where it is
developing a business park in Braselton.
</P>
<P>
   However, he feels no pressure to follow the Indianapolis REIT.
``We attempt to be a little more infill-oriented,'' he said.
``We're not going to be pioneering.''
</P>
<P>
   The company also does not feel obligated to jump on the
bandwagon of developers who are building huge speculative
warehouses and distribution centers in Henry County. The gamble has
paid off for First Industrial Realty Trust, a Chicago-based REIT
that signed Amazon.com to an 800,000-square-foot lease in
McDonough, Ga. last year.
</P>
<P>
   Companies such as Amazon seek locations in places like Henry
County because of the cheap land and labor, Moghadam said. AMB
would rather develop in locations based on their strong real estate
fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
   He offers as evidence the Webvan facility, which AMB bought from
Atlanta developer Industrial Developments International. Even if
the technology start-up fails _ and Moghadam said AMB wants to help
Webvan succeed _ the REIT will not be stuck holding an
underperforming property.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proper underwriting (of a dot-com company) is to get back
the building,'' he said. ``If this tenant doesn't work, there are
plenty of others that will.''
</P>
<P>
   AMB will not lease a property to a company with no credit
history ``unless we're comfortable owning the building as an empty
spec building in a competitive market,'' he said. AMB further
lowers its risk by not financing improvements tenants make to
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   AMB has completed deals with Webvan in Seattle and northern
Virginia. Moghadam said the company is ``the ultimate tenant for
our strategy'' of focusing on high-volume distribution facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the business of serving customers in high-speed
logistics,'' he said. ``Our goal is to make Webvan successful.''

THE ALAMO REMEMBERED BUT TRANSFORMED
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Tenn., Calif.)  By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ There is a story, perhaps apocryphal, that late
one evening a few years ago a young father brought his baby son to
the Alamo. With spotlights bathing the limestone mission in a
yellow glow, the father supposedly lifted the newborn above his
head, oblivious to the workings of the modern city, as if making an
offering at an ancient altar.
</P>
<P>
   This, it might be said, was a real Texas baptism.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Harrigan, who heard the story while researching his new
historical novel, ``The Gates of the Alamo,'' passes it along not
necessarily as fact but as a reminder of the enduring claim made by
the Alamo on the imagination and identity of Texas. Even today
grade school students across the state are taught the Alamo's
legend of doomed sacrifice and valor, as a sort of spiritual
bedrock upon which Texas was born and built.
</P>
<P>
   Harrigan, now 51, was once one of those students. He visited the
Alamo as a 7-year-old on a family trip and left transformed. When
he decided as a teen-ager to become a novelist, he concluded that
he would write about the Alamo. Three decades intervened before he
managed to take up the subject, but much to his surprise he found
it largely unplowed, at least in fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thinks it's hackneyed,'' Harrigan said recently over
lunch at the Menger Hotel, a block from the Alamo. ``When I would
tell people I was writing a book about the Alamo, they would tend
to roll their eyes: Hasn't that story been done to death? But, in
fact, as I started doing the research I realized, no, it hasn't.
The mythological story is very, very familiar, but the real story
is not.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the real story remains a subject of debate. The
central tenets, at least as told on the Texas side, is that the
vastly outmanned defenders, including William Barret Travis, Jim
Bowie and Davy Crockett, refused to surrender although no help was
coming, and fought to the death against Santa Anna and his Mexican
Army. When Santa Anna was later defeated in the Battle of San
Jacinto, thus liberating Texas from Mexico, the victorious Texas
army famously shouted, ``Remember the Alamo!''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, academics and Alamo enthusiasts convened at the
University of Texas in Austin to consider the authenticity of the
diary of de la Pena, a Mexican soldier who took part in the Alamo
assault. The diary includes a small passage that describes the
surrender and subsequent execution of Crockett. That Crockett would
have surrendered suggests that perhaps the defenders were not quite
so eager to die, and many ``Alamoheads'' claim the diary is a fake.
But if academics could not determine its truthfulness, they did
confirm its authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   This tension between mythology and revisionism meant that
Harrigan's novel would require as much historical research as
imagination. Determined to provide a ``cold splash of reality,'' he
repeatedly interviewed experts: Stephen L. Hardin, the historian,
and Thomas Ricks Lindleyan, an independent scholar. He pored over
old medical journals, military manuals and records of the Mexican
government. From diaries he picked up period expressions like
``Well, if that don't take the dilapidated linen!''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, and not surprisingly, he discovered that many of the
old myths he had learned as a child were not true. Perhaps the most
famous Alamo story is of Travis gathering his men inside the
besieged garrison, informing them that reinforcements were not
coming and drawing a line in the sand with his sword and
challenging his men to cross it and fight to the death for freedom.
It is a stirring anecdote but one considered a fabrication by many
modern Alamo scholars.
</P>
<P>
   ``That moment to me is the linchpin of the Alamo myth,'' he
said. ``Once that is gone and once that idea of deliberate
self-sacrifice is gone, the Alamo story becomes a human story and
not a mythological one. You realize these guys were not intent on
dying, they were intent on living.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem in plotting a novel around the real events of the
Alamo is that the end is something of downer: everyone dies. To
navigate this, Harrigan framed his book around fictional
characters, Texan and Mexican, tossed in a love story and took
pains not to tread too fearfully around the historical icons. He
paints Bowie as something of a charming swindler and Travis as a
foolish but magnetic leader enthralled with his presumed destiny.
He admits to being charmed by the homespun Crockett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised in my revisionist heart how much I like
Crockett,'' he said. ``What a good guy he seems to have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Winders, the resident historian and curator of the Alamo,
credits Harrigan with creating a vivid story but one based on
credible historical assumptions he described as ``extremely
current.'' Recent new research suggests that reinforcements were en
route to the Alamo, Winders said, and that Travis, contrary to
popular interpretation, knew it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is much more willingness to accept new interpretations
when it's based on solid research,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harrigan, who has written two other novels, a nonfiction book
about scuba diving and two collections of essays, has enjoyed the
success of his latest book. The novel reached The New York Times
hardback fiction bestseller list for one week in April and has
enjoyed almost universally glowing reviews. His publisher, Knopf,
sent him on a national 11-city tour, which ended this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I draw the line at wearing a coonskin cap,'' he said with a
smile. ``You wouldn't believe how many people have asked me to do
that. And on me, a coonskin cap looks like a toupee.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Born in Oklahoma City, Harrigan grew up in Corpus Christi on the
Texas coast, attended the University of Texas in Austin and
published his first novel, ``Aransas,'' about a dolphin trainer. In
the early 1980s he joined the staff of Texas Monthly, the magazine
that has nurtured many of the best Texas writers, and for a decade
the job allowed him to explore Texas.
</P>
<P>
   With three daughters and a wife to support, Harrigan began
writing screenplays after leaving Texas Monthly in 1991. Now he is
part of a small but successful weekly breakfast club of Austin
screenwriters who include Bill Broyles, whose credits include
``Apollo 13,'' and Lawrence Wright, the novelist, screenwriter and
writer for The New Yorker. Harrigan's credits range widely, from
the critically acclaimed television drama ``Beyond the Prairie: The
True Story of Laura Ingalls Wilder,'' broadcast in January, to far
less acclaimed screenplays like the recent ``John Denver Story.''
</P>
<P>
   He began ``The Gates of the Alamo'' eight years ago, working
weekends, nights and mornings around his ``day job'' of writing
screenplays. When he finally finished the book, he struggled with a
title, dismissing ``Remember the Alamo!,'' out of fear that it
would evoke a B-movie cheesiness. One day as he drove down the
highway groping with different titles, he looked up and saw a sign
that read, ``Alamo Title Co.'' He considered it but thought
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Harrigan's ultimate target in writing about the Alamo was Texas
itself and ``the death grip'' its history holds on its inhabitants.
Even today, the Alamo remains the most visited historical site in
the state, with more than 3 million visitors every year. And
Harrigan believes that even if the real story of the Alamo is
something less than the legend, it is no less powerful, or to him,
inspiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Alamo as an icon speaks to an ideal that I think is very
legitimate and very alive and transcends all sorts of cultural and
ethnic boundaries,'' he said. ``The ideal is that there is
something worth dying for, there is something you would willingly
give your life for. Whether that's the liberation of Texas from
Mexico, or the stealing of Texas from Mexico, or any other
enterprise is kind of irrelevant. What matters is that people have
faith in that concept. That's why people remember the Alamo,
because that ideal is worth remembering.''

AH, TO BE IN ENGLAND, NOW THAT ALL THE GREEN IS THERE  

</HEADLINE>
   By DARYL LEASE   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   I knew the drought was bad here on
the Gulch Coast, but I had no idea how bad until I looked out on my
patio the other day and saw a couple of love bugs stop snuggling
long enough to smack a palmetto bug out of his lounge chair and
steal his jug of Gatorade. Man, that's dry.
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm fairly new to rapidly growing Florida, so I've been going
over the local water regulations with my attorney this past week to
make sure I'm not risking prosecution when I turn on the spigot.
I've asked him to decode the directions for my automated sprinkler
system, too, but he says the billable hours would make me weep a
fountain of tears, so I ought to just think about his charging me
and sop the lawn that way.
</P>
<P>
   My wife's been out of town, and she left me with the delicate
task of watering her plants. As if it wasn't bad enough to live in
fear of killing off the potted whatchamacallit, I now endure
nightmares that feature me in a prison bunk, staring forlornly at
the ceiling as I listen to the conversations of fellow inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Inmate One: ``Psst. What are you in for?''
</P>
<P>
   Inmate Two: ``Malicious flushing. Unlawful rinsing of a
toothbrush. You?''
</P>
<P>
   Inmate One: ``Possession of ice cubes with intent to
distribute.''
</P>
<P>
   Inmate Two: ``Fellow in the next cell got caught watering
bromelaids.''
</P>
<P>
   Inmate One: ``What a prevert.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure the rest of you are also having trouble finding a
cloud, let alone a silver lining, in this extended dry spell. So,
at the risk of sounding overly sunny, I offer up this bit of good
cheer _ in lush landscapes, true evil lurks.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as we survey our withered lawns and gardens, we should
be grateful that no one's going to try to filch the greenery _ er,
brownery _ from our yards. Some people are not so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Over in England, it seems, folks with green thumbs are coming
down with a bad case of itchy fingers. Gardening thieves are
running amok, swiping anything that isn't bolted down or buried
deep.
</P>
<P>
   USA Today reports that the Mother Country is caught up in a
cultivation craze right now. Gardening is a $5-billion-a-year
industry, and gardeners have become national celebrities. One show
on the BBC draws 12 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Gardening is so popular that there's now an underground market
for plants. Marauding bandits are roaming the countryside, digging
up unusual or hard-to-get varieties to sell to shady gardeners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most expensive items are stolen to order,'' an insurance
agency spokesman told USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in the garden is safe. One poor lady in Bristol lost
flowers, trees, stone ornaments, a 3-feet-deep artificial pond and
all of the goldfish contained therein.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big business and highly lucrative,'' says Steve
Parnwell, a law enforcement officer who heads a 20-member task
force _ yes, 20 _ focused on plant snippery.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 1 million people in England have green stuff stolen
each year, according to USA Today. At least one insurance company,
faced with the prospects of paying out pots of money in claims,
stopped offering policies for gardens. It later reintroduced
coverage after so many customers demanded it.
</P>
<P>
   A drought like ours obviously would dry up this crime wave, but
unfortunately for England, that's not in the forecast. I suspect
the gardeners themselves will have to nip this problem in the bud.
</P>
<P>
   An army has already been mustered. The Royal Horticultural
Society _ or the Royal Hort, as it's known in the trenches _ is a
quarter-million strong.
</P>
<P>
   That's not quite as large or fiercesome as, say, our National
Rifle Association, but _ trust me on this one _ gardeners are a
tough lot and know how to fight dirty.
</P>
<P>
   So, as we watch our grass and flowers die, let our spirits be
lifted by the good and noble battle now under way across the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   At this very moment, mad-dog Englishmen, armed with the trowels,
are bravely preparing to defend their home turf.
</P>
<P>
   May they hoe a righteous row. May justice rain down upon the
heads of their tormenters.
</P>
<P>
   Should the tide turn against the gardeners, we Americans should
stand ready to lend a hand. I'm thinking love-bug bombs might do
the job nicely.

PEACEKEEPERS WARY OF MORE SERB-ALBANIAN VIOLENCE IN MITROVICA  
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MITROVICA, Yugoslavia _ The French commander of this volatile
town, Gen. Pierre de Saqui de Sannes, told a visiting U.N. Security
Council delegation recently that the place was calm. Minutes later,
before the visitors had even left town, the first stones were
thrown in a weekend of street violence that left six French
soldiers and one U.N. policeman injured, several buildings burned
and dozens of foreign cars damaged.
</P>
<P>
   It is the nature of Mitrovica, the last town in Kosovo with a
significant presence of Serbs, to explode without warning, and no
one knows better than the general. In February, on his second day
on the job, this town exploded in the worst night of rioting that
the NATO-led peacekeeping force, known locally as KFOR, has seen
since foreign troops arrived in Kosovo last June.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, as he prepared to hand over the job to
another French general, de Saqui de Sannes said that the situation
remains extremely ``delicate'' and that there is no guarantee
against further violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot stop another attack occurring in north Mitrovica,''
he said in a recent interview. ``There are a number of extremists
on both sides. It could happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreigners working in Mitrovica complain that despite some 2,000
troops, including a contingent from the French Foreign Legion, and
several hundred international police, the peacekeepers are still
not in control of either the Albanian-dominated southern part of
Mitrovica or its northern Serb enclave.
</P>
<P>
   ``KFOR and the U.N. have been unable to become the ruling power
here,'' said a senior officer working for the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe. ``They have never been the
governing authority except on paper.'' Former members of the now
disbanded Kosovo Liberation Army rule the Albanian side, and the
Serbs are in charge in the north, the officer said. ``There is a
climate of complete impunity here that has to be changed.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been some changes since the violent months of
February and March, with the arrival of troop reinforcements and
the appointment of a retired U.S. general, William Nash, as the new
regional administrator. Nash, who has experience as a peacekeeper
in nearby Bosnia, has injected a certain dynamism into decision
making. After the recent violence, he had a stream of people attend
meetings in his office and reintroduced joint police and military
patrols, recognition of the poor cooperation to date.
</P>
<P>
   From the street, Mitrovica's divisions look uglier than ever.
The boundaries between the Serb northern district and the Albanian
areas are now defined by coils of razor wire and sandbagged
military checkpoints. In the name of security for both communities,
the troops have reinforced the divisions between the two.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Albanians expelled from their homes in February have
returned home to a designated zone around the Ibar River that
divides the Serb and Albanian districts, but they came under armed
protection and now live behind armor and barbed wire. The U.N. High
Commissioner of Refugees estimates that 60 percent of the estimated
2,000 people who fled in February have yet to return.
</P>
<P>
   Izet Jaha, a 72-year-old Albanian, has French soldiers watching
over him from an observation post in the house next door. ``While
KFOR is up there, we can take our socks off while we sleep,'' he
said. ``If they were not here, none of us would be here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs also feel insecure, distrustful of both the
peacekeepers and the United Nations, and fearful of a mass influx
of Albanians into their district that would force them to flee.
Dusko Prodanovic, a Serb bank manager who lives just one block from
the dividing line, said the increased security was ``just a
charade,'' and he saw little prospect for peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Albanians hate us so much that they do not want to
live with us,'' he said. ``The Americans are just waiting to expel
us,'' his wife, Bosanka, blurted out in agitation.
</P>
<P>
   If the Albanians suffered more directly from the February
violence, the Serbs have lost out overall, said a member of the
OSCE office in Mitrovica. ``The Serbs have lost a lot in these last
three months,'' she said. ``They managed to expel a few hundred
Albanians, but the reaction of the international community was very
strong against them.''
</P>
<P>
   After trying to negotiate with the Serbs to return the Albanians
and establish a safety zone, de Saqui de Sannes did that by force.
He also used force to push back from one bridge the Serb thugs who
kept watch to deter Albanians from crossing to the north side.
</P>
<P>
   ``We showed that we will not accept partition, and the Albanians
feel that,'' the general said. ``Now we must show that we will also
not accept that Serbs be pushed out.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When Nash arrived in April his assignment was to prevent
partition of the city and the northern Serb-dominated part of
Kosovo. His goal has already shifted to bringing back the Serbs to
Kosovo. ``The issue we now face today is not partition but the
prosperous and safe return of Serbs to their homes,'' he said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   But violence simmers on. After the April 29 violence that
followed the Security Council visit, an elderly Albanian couple was
evicted from an apartment in northern Mitrovica. And the Serb
bridge watchers remain in charge on the main bridge, threatening
Albanians and sometimes foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   The international police force and peacekeepers have so far
failed to arrest anyone for the killings during the February riots
and the damage done on April 29. Police cells are full of petty
criminals and drug addicts, but the general admitted that arresting
the real troublemakers ``could spark a bigger problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The approach has raised questions about the French peacekeepers'
determination to enforce order. In the smaller Serb enclave of
Gracanica, by contrast, Swedish troops immediately move in
forcefully to arrest troublemakers when there is any commotion. A
Swedish soldier recently shot one man in the leg to deter an
attack, and several men have been expelled from the settlement for
a period of three months, according to one Swedish officer. ``You
have to show them force, otherwise they don't stop,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a working judiciary is another danger. A number of
Serb detainees, some of them alleged war criminals, staged a hunger
strike recently demanding trials, and relatives began daily street
demonstrations. U.N. officials admit they have delayed the
potentially explosive trials in Mitrovica, although they did start
this month, and serious cases are due in June.

FASTER THAN LIGHT, MAYBE, BUT NOT BACK TO THE FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: the letter `c,' in 7th graf and throughout, is used as a
symbol for the velocity of light.) 
 (The Science Times)  
 By JAMES GLANZ    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The speed at which light travels through a vacuum, about 186,000
miles per second, is enshrined in physics lore as a universal speed
limit. Nothing can travel faster than that speed, according to
freshman textbooks and conversation at sophisticated wine bars; if
anything could, Einstein's theory of relativity would crumble, and
theoretical physics would fall into disarray.
</P>
<P>
   Two new experiments have demonstrated how flexible or misleading
that comfortable wisdom can be in the right circumstances. Using a
combination of atomic and electromagnetic effects, researchers have
produced light beams in the laboratory that appear to travel much
faster than the normal speed of light. Einstein's theory survives,
physicists say, but the results of the experiments, they agree, are
mind-bending.
</P>
<P>
   In the most striking of the new experiments a pulse of light
that passes through a transparent chamber filled with specially
prepared cesium gas appears to be pushed to speeds of 300 times the
normal speed of light. That is so fast that, under these peculiar
circumstances, the main part of the pulse exits the chamber even
before it enters.
</P>
<P>
   It is as if someone looking through a window at home were to see
a man slip and fall on a patch of ice while crossing the street
well before witnesses on the sidewalk saw the mishap occur _ a
preview of the future. But Einstein's theory, and at least a shred
of common sense, seem to survive, the physicists explain, because
the effect could never be used to signal back in time to change the
past and, in the example, avert the accident.
</P>
<P>
   A paper on the experiment, by Dr. Lijun Wang of the NEC Research
Institute in Princeton, N.J., has been submitted to Nature and is
undergoing peer review. It is only the most spectacular example of
work by a wide range of researchers who have recently produced
superluminal speeds of propagation in various materials, in hopes
of finding a chink in Einstein's armor and of using the effect in
practical applications like speeding up electrical circuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like a beautiful experiment,'' said Dr. Raymond
Chiao, a professor of physics at the University of California at
Berkeley, who, like a number of physicists in the close-knit
community of optics research, is knowledgeable about Wang's work.
</P>
<P>
   Chiao, whose own research laid some of the groundwork for the
experiment, added that ``there's been a lot of controversy'' over
whether the finding means that actual information _ like the news
of an impending accident _ could be sent faster than c, the
velocity of light. But he said that he and most other physicists
agreed that it could not.
</P>
<P>
   Though declining to provide details of his paper because it is
under review, Wang said: ``Our light pulses can indeed be made to
travel faster than c. This is a special property of light itself,
which is different from a familiar object like a brick,'' since
light is a wave with no mass. A brick could not travel so fast
without creating truly big problems for physics, not to mention
humanity as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   A paper on the second new experiment, by Dr. Daniela Mugnai, Dr.
Anedio Ranfagni and Dr. Rocco Ruggeri of the Italian National
Research Council, described what appeared to be slightly
faster-than-c propagation of microwaves through ordinary air, and
was published in the May 22 issue of Physical Review Letters.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of chamber in Wang's experiment is normally used to
amplify waves of laser light, not speed them up, said Dr. Aephraim
Steinberg, a physicist at the University of Toronto. In the usual
arrangement, one beam of light is shone on the chamber, exciting
the cesium atoms, and then a second beam passing through the
chamber soaks up some of that energy and gets amplified when it
passes through the atoms.
</P>
<P>
   But the amplification occurs only if the second beam is tuned to
a certain precise wavelength, Steinberg said. By cleverly choosing
a slightly different wavelength, Wang induced the cesium to speed
up a light pulse without distorting it in any way. ``If you look at
the total pulse that comes out, it doesn't actually get
amplified,'' Steinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Wang's experiment uses another property of light signals. Light
signals, consisting of packets of waves, actually have two
important speeds: the speed of the individual peaks and troughs of
the light waves themselves, and the speed of the pulse or packet
into which they are bunched.
</P>
<P>
   A pulse may contain billions or trillions of tiny peaks and
troughs. In air the two speeds are the same, but in the excited
cesium they are not only different, but the pulses and the waves of
which they are composed can travel in opposite directions, like a
pocket of congestion on a highway, which can propagate back from a
toll booth as rush hour begins, even as all the cars are still
moving forward.
</P>
<P>
   These so-called backward modes are not new in themselves, having
been routinely measured in other media like plasmas, or ionized
gases.
</P>
<P>
   But in the cesium experiment, the outcome is particularly
strange because the backward light waves can, according to the laws
of quantum mechanics, in effect, borrow energy from the excited
cesium atoms before giving it back a short time later. The overall
result is an outgoing wave exactly the same in shape and intensity
as the incoming wave; the outgoing wave just leaves early, before
the peak of the incoming wave even arrives.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As most physicists interpret the experiment, it is a
low-intensity precursor (sometimes called a tail, even when it
comes first) of the incoming wave that clues the cesium chamber to
the imminent arrival of a pulse. In a process whose details are
poorly understood, the cesium chamber reconstructs the entire pulse
solely from information contained in the shape and size of the
tail, and spits outs the pulse early.
</P>
<P>
   If the side of the chamber facing the incoming wave is called
the near side, and the other the far side, the sequence of events
is something like the following. The incoming wave packet, its tail
extending ahead of it, approaches the chamber. Before the incoming
signal's peak gets to the near side of the chamber, a pulse is
emitted from the far side, along with a backward-moving wave
packet, which heads back for the near side.
</P>
<P>
   The backward wave packet, moving slower than c by a factor of
300, arrives at the near side of the chamber much later, but just
in time to meet the main part of the the incoming light pulse. The
peaks of one wave packet overlap the troughs of the other, so they
cancel each other out and nothing remains. What has really happened
is that the incoming wave has ``paid back'' the cesium atoms that
lent energy on the other side of the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Someone who looked only at the beginning and end of the
experiment would see only a pulse of light that somehow jumped
forward in time by moving faster than normal light speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effect is really quite dramatic,'' Steinberg said. ``For a
first demonstration, I think this is beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   In Wang's experiment, the outgoing pulse had already traveled
about 60 feet from the chamber before the main part of the incoming
pulse had reached the chamber's near side. That distance
corresponds to 60-billionths of a second of light travel time. But
it really would not allow anyone to send information faster than c,
said Dr. Peter W. Milonni, a physicist at Los Alamos National
Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information is already there in the leading edge of the
pulse,'' Milonni said. ``You can get the impression of sending
information superluminally even though you're not sending
information.''
</P>
<P>
   So for most physicists, no fundamental principles have been
smashed in the new work.
</P>
<P>
   Not all physicists agree that the question has been settled,
though. ``This problem is still open,'' said Ranfagni of the
Italian group, which used an ingenious set of reflecting optics to
create microwave pulses that seemed to travel as much as 25 percent
faster than c over short distances.
</P>
<P>
   At least one physicist, Dr. Guenter Nimtz of the University of
Cologne, holds the opinion that a number of experiments, including
those of the Italian group, have in fact sent information
superluminally. But not even Nimtz believes that this trick will
allow one to reach back in time. He says, in essence, that the time
it takes to read any incoming information will fritter away any
temporal advantage, making it impossible to signal back and change
events in the past.
</P>
<P>
   However those debates end, though, Steinberg said that
techniques closely related to Wang's might someday be used to speed
up signals that normally get slowed down by passing through all
sorts of ordinary materials in circuits. A miniaturized version of
Wang's setup ``is exactly the kind of system you'd want for that
application,'' Steinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly for those who would like to see a computer chip without a
speed limit, the trick would help the signals travel closer to the
speed of light, but not beyond it, he said.

`M:I-2' LEADS TOP FILMS TO A RECORD FOR WEEKEND 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK LYMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ The holiday weekend, spurred by a spectacular
opening for Tom Cruise's ``M:I-2''; a solid debut for Jackie Chan's
comic western, ``Shanghai Noon''; and strong holdover business for
May hits like ``Dinosaur,'' ``Gladiator'' and ``Road Trip,'' has
seen a Memorial Day record of $174.7 million in ticket sales for
the top 12 films.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's huge; it's amazing,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, chairman
of Exhibitor Relations, a Los Angeles company that monitors
box-office performance. ``Typically, Memorial Day is totally
dominated by one film, but this shows a real depth at the box
office that you don't normally see.''
</P>
<P>
   It also smashes the record of $148 million _ for the top 50
films _ set over the four-day Memorial Day weekend in 1997, when
``The Lost World: Jurassic Park'' opened with $90.2 million.
Exhibitor Relations charts only the performance of the top 12 films
in its initial estimates, released Monday, but when the numbers are
compiled for the top 50 in coming days, Dergarabedian said, the
2000 Memorial Day cumulative box office could well rise above $190
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is amazing how big the smiles are around our business this
weekend,'' said Chuck Viane, president for distribution at Disney.
``It really sets everybody up for the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie landscape may be shifting, as many here believe, with
audiences demanding offbeat stories, studios pushing for lower
costs, and rapidly changing technologies constantly rattling the
firmament. But when the weather gets hot and schools begin to let
out, audiences apparently want what they have always craved: big
stars doing big stunts in big movies and, of course, dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the course of the year we will seek out movies that are
a little bit different, but when it comes to the holidays, when you
want to be with your family, you look for star-driven vehicles or
technological vehicles or comedies or something that you are sure
is going to work,'' Viane said.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise's film, whose title stands for ``Mission: Impossible-2,''
earned an estimated $71.8 million in 3,653 theaters over the
four-day weekend, making it the second-biggest opening ever, after
the ``Jurassic Park'' sequel, stronger even than last year's
holiday weekend showing for the heavily hyped ``Star Wars: Episode
1 _ The Phantom Menace.'' The original ``Mission: Impossible''
film, released on Memorial Day weekend in 1996, earned $56.8
million in its four-day opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly this record was spurred by the success of `Mission:
Impossible 2,''' said Robert G. Friedman, vice chairman of the
Paramount Motion Picture Group, which is distributing the film.
``What's amazing is that the good will left over from the first
film combined with the enormous popularity of Tom Cruise and the
adoration toward director John Woo from some in the movie audience
came together to create this tremendous opening.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, after the disappointing box office performance of
Cruise's previous two films _ Stanley Kubrick's ``Eyes Wide Shut''
and Paul Thomas Anderson's ``Magnolia'' _ there was some
speculation in Hollywood that the actor's star might be dimming.
All that will be forgotten now.
</P>
<P>
   ``M:I-2'' should pass the $100 million mark on Tuesday or
Wednesday; it has already earned $92.8 million since its opening on
Wednesday. Early estimates are that it will be the first of what
may be several $200 million movies this summer. Last summer a
record number of films earned more than $100 million and, based on
the early box office strength shown this year, studio executives
are predicting a repeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at what's out there already,'' Viane said. ``It will be
hard for me not to believe there will be a dozen, if not more, $100
million movies this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming potential blockbusters include Nicolas Cage in ``Gone in
60 Seconds,'' an auto-theft thriller; Mel Gibson in ``The
Patriot,'' a Revolutionary War epic; and George Clooney in ``The
Perfect Storm,'' an adaptation of the nonfiction best seller about
fishermen fighting a raging storm in the North Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's computer-animated ``Dinosaur'' finished in second place
over the weekend, earning $33.5 million for a cumulative total of
$81.9 million since its May 19 opening. The newcomer ``Shanghai
Noon,'' another Disney film, finished third with $19.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks' ``Gladiator'' was fourth with $17.3 million and a
cumulative total of $127.2 million since its May 5 opening. ``Road
Trip,'' another DreamWorks film, was in fifth place with $14
million and a cumulative total of $35.8 since its May 12 debut.
</P>
<P>
   The box office estimates are for the four-day holiday weekend,
meaning that it includes actual ticket sales from theaters on
Friday, Saturday and Sunday, plus each studio's estimates of ticket
sales for Monday. Adjusted final figures, including actual ticket
sales Monday, will be released on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the news for studios was good, though. ``The Flintstones
in Viva Rock Vegas'' did not click with family audiences in May and
has already dipped to 11th place at the box office, while John
Travolta's ``Battlefield Earth'' has tumbled out of the top 12
after only 18 days of release.
</P>
<P>
   ``This weekend's box office sort of flies in the face of what
everybody thought was a sea change in terms of summer blockbusters,
especially in light of `The Blair Witch Project' and `The Sixth
Sense' last summer,'' Dergarabedian said. ``Typically, popcorn
movies are what rules the summer and that hasn't changed. This is
just what people want in the summer.''

   WEST-FIRES (Washington) _ The wildfire that swept through Los
Alamos, N.M., earlier this month is setting off alarms across the
mountain West, where more and more Americans have chosen to live on
the forest's edge. Experts say those housing shifts have multiplied
the danger that other fires could kindle similar disasters
elsewhere. They lie behind an urgent new congressional quest for
millions of dollars in emergency money to try to ease the risk.
Across the country, the damage caused by wildfire to homes and
property increased sixfold between the 1980s and 1990s, to a total
of $3.2 billion over the last 10 years, federal officials say. In
an average year over the past decade, 1,200 homes have burned. By
Douglas Jehl.

<P>
   LABOR-POLITICS (Undated) _ Organized labor may have suffered a
bruising setback when the House of Representatives approved the
China trade bill last week, but there is widespread agreement, even
among labor's opponents, that the nation's unions are growing
stronger after years of decline. After steadily losing influence
for two decades, the labor movement has begun to rebound under John
Sweeney, the AFL-CIO's president, by reversing its membership slide
and by throwing its weight around far more in elections and on
Capitol Hill. Thomas Donohue, president of the U. S. Chamber of
Commerce, said it would be foolish to dismiss labor's power because
of the China trade vote. ``Labor has a lot of money. Labor has a
lot of forces on the ground. Anyone who wants to declare them weak,
just look out for the next fight.'' By Steven Greenhouse.

   PALESTINIANS-CAMPS (Ain el Hilweh Camp, Lebanon) _ For the
300,000 Palestinians who have lived for half a century in squalid,
supposedly makeshift refugee camps in Lebanon, the Israeli troop
withdrawal last week proved a bittersweet experience. For them, the
moment was distinctly powerful: from the newly opened border area,
they could gaze on the hills of what they consider their land. For
an entire generation of Palestinians in Lebanon, it was the very
first glimpse, and suddenly, painfully, they felt both closer and
farther away than ever. By Deboarah Sontag.

   DOCTORS-OLINE (Undated) _ The race is on to transform visits to
the doctor by providing a wealth of clinical information online for
physicians. Several top medical schools, including the latest entry
from Stanford, are preparing sites of their own, and there are
several commercially operated sites as well. These Websites
reinforce a doctor's knowledge, suggest diagnoses, and provide
on-the-spot answers to patients' questions about their symptoms. In
the process, the new Websites and the other medical information
online have the potential to alter the relationship between patient
and doctor. By Milt Freudenheim.

   JAPAN-BABY-BOUNTY (Tokyo) _ While other Japanese companies give
congratulatory bonuses to child-bearing employees, the Bandai
Corp., a major toy maker, is offering to pay employees $10,000 for
every baby they have after their second child _ the largest baby
bounty ever in Japan, which is struggling to reduce record-low
birth rates that are threatening the country's long-term viability.

   NY-SOUTHHAMPTON-TAX (Southampton, N.Y.) _ Behind the privet
hedges that shield the many monstrous mansions in this village by
the sea, something semi-revolutionary is brewing. The rich folks
who summer in the Village of Southampton are up in arms, in an
understated, law-abiding kind of way, about an American principle
for which colonial patriots tossed tea into Boston Harbor: taxation
without representation. This village has been floating in a deep
green sea of property tax money since the 1890s, when plutocrats
like W.K. Vanderbilt began to erect gargantuan houses that they
called cottages. Since then, more and more summer people have
bought their way into Southampton, and they pay about
three-quarters of the property taxes. The justice that summer
people seek is the right to vote on village matters while still
keeping their permanent residence back home. By Blaine Harden.

 &HT;    INVITING TOURISTS TO BORDER ``HUNTS'' FOR HUMANS IS NOTHING
NEW(a)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Tourists as soldiers of fortune.
</P>
<P>
   That was the gist of an anonymous appeal that surfaced last
month: Fun in the Arizona sun. The great outdoors. The chance to
help ranchers hunt illegal immigrants along the U.S.-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   But this isn't the first time the idea of hunting humans for
sport has cropped up in Douglas, a border town known for mining,
ranching - and now, illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy years ago, a similar proposal to tourists was pitched in
this same corner of Arizona. But rather than Mexicans, it was
Apache Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the Fimbres Apache Expedition is not only a
reminder of the long-standing racial hostilities along the
Arizona-Mexico border, but it's also a tragic lesson about
vigilantism.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1930 and Douglas, the hub of the nation's copper-smelting
industry, was in an economic slump. The Great Depression was
underway and all the economic indicators pointed downward.
</P>
<P>
   The town's merchants, however, were pioneering people. If
ranching was slow and copper mining on the wane, they would find
some other way to generate money.
</P>
<P>
   And they did. Tourism.
</P>
<P>
   But not just any kind. A.C. Karger, then mayor of Douglas, and
the shrewd chiefs of the local Chamber of Commerce were going to
sell a special brand of tourism, one that capitalized on every
attribute Douglas had to offer: a magnificent railroad station,
excellent rail connections, a world-class hotel, a warm, dry
climate with blue skies and breathtaking scenery.
</P>
<P>
   And the chance to kill Apaches, although that was never overtly
stated in the fliers and newspaper ads promoting the expedition
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The stated purpose of the expedition was the attempted rescue of
a 7-year-old boy who had been kidnapped by a band of Apaches three
years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the underlying message was not lost on the outpouring of
men who wrote letters hoping to join the expedition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never fought Indians, but I have chased Spics all
around Haiti and Nicaragua,'' wrote one adventure-seeker. ``I guess
I'll have the guts to chase these birds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have traveled all over the globe. I have seen a bit of life
and have fought men of all colors, so I would like to become a
member of your expedition, for I love action,'' wrote another.
</P>
<P>
   The Fimbres Apache Expedition stemmed from years of hostilities
between a Mexican rancher named Francisco Fimbres and a band of
Apaches based in the rugged Sierra Madres.
</P>
<P>
   Although warfare between the Indians and the United States
officially ended with Geronimo's surrender on Sept. 6, 1886,
hostilities with his band of Apaches - the Bronco group of the
Chiricahua - continued on both sides of the Mexican border for
another 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   The hostilities exploded into open warfare on Oct. 26, 1926 when
the Apaches ambushed Fimbres and his family. The Apaches killed
Fimbres' wife and kidnapped his son, Geraldo. The Apaches were
seeking revenge for an earlier kidnapping of Geronimo's
great-granddaughter by Fimbres.
</P>
<P>
   The Fimbres Apache Expedition captured nationwide attention, but
in the end the expedition never got off the ground. Officials on
both sides of the border realized the idea of armed gringos roaming
around in Mexico could spell disaster and they quashed the
expedition.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't stop Fimbres. When he learned help from the gringos
was not coming, he reverted to his old tactics. With the help of
vaqueros (Mexican cowboys) and expatriate American mercenaries,
Fimbres hunted down the Apaches himself. A March 13, 1931, photo
captured Fimbres with the scalps of three Apaches.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Fimbres finally found his son in an Apache
camp, hanging from a tree. In revenge for the three Apaches killed
earlier by Fimbres and his men, the Apaches had swung the boy by
his heels and smashed his skull against an oak tree.
</P>
<P>
   Fimbres and his men retaliated yet again, until the last of the
Apaches were hunted down and killed.
</P>
<P>
   The Fimbres Apache Expedition was chronicled in a 1993 book,
``They Never Surrendered: Bronco Apaches of the Sierra Madres,
1890-1935,'' by Texas author Douglas Meed.
</P>
<P>
   Meed sees a parallel between the Fimbres expedition and a
``Neighborhood Ranch Watch'' flier distributed in April that hoped
to convert tourists into soldiers of fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a parallel there, because what you are doing is
asking people to come down and hunt people as sport,'' Meed said.
``The difference is that the ranchers are trying to protect their
land rather than make money off this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Meed also thinks the most recent episode could spark a new round
of violence along the border.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix writer John Alba came across accounts of the Fimbres
Apache Expedition while researching a novel set during the same
period.
</P>
<P>
   He also sees a link between the two calls for vigilantism along
the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a parallel there as to how some Anglo people view
dark-skinned people as less than human,'' Alba said. ``At that
time, in the 1930s, it was the Apaches who were viewed as animals
to be hunted down and exterminated. Now it's common to hear in
various places along the border these expressions that the illegals
are a plague, a vermin, an invasion that has to be stopped.''

   MAGAZINE REVIEWS -------
</P>
<P>
   ``ATLANTIC MONTHLY''
</P>
<P>
   Fascinating cover story suggests that the Unabomber was actually
born at Harvard, which gave Ted Kaczynski his first taste of higher
education. Story notes that Kaczynski, who was 16 when he arrived
in Cambridge, Mass., was the subject of a brutal series of
psychological tests that may have started him down the road to
mental illness. His anti-technology bent also may have formed there
as a reaction to curriculum that preached that science was the one
true belief and faith and morality were just window dressing. It's
interesting to note that the piece is written by Alston Chase, a
Harvard graduate and mathematician who, like Kaczynski, moved to
the Montana wilderness in the early 1970s. Another story calls
White working class males the ``forgotten majority.''
</P>
<P>
   ``NEW YORKER''
</P>
<P>
   Long piece questions the actions of Desert Storm Gen. Barry
McCaffrey, noting that his 24th Infantry Division attacked a line
of retreating Iraqi vehicles and troops for several hours with
hardly any response from the Iraqis. The attack came two days after
the cease-fire, and officers and enlisted men interviewed later
said there was little or no Iraqi fire at all. Piece also notes
that McCaffrey's troops also opened fire on unarmed prisoners near
a hospital bus, though McCaffrey, who is now President Clinton's
drug czar, was not on the scene. The story was written by Seymour
M. Hersh, who conducted hundreds of interviews. In a fun read,
Edward Hoagland writes a memoir of the time he literally ran away
and joined the circus.
</P>
<P>
   ``TYCOON''
</P>
<P>
   We have to admit we were hoping for a how-to guide with this
one, but instead we got a dopey feature on Greg Norman. ``Greg
Norman is his name, and golf is his game,'' the story opines. Wow.
Point of the story seems to be that Norman has made a lot of money
selling his shark clothes and building golf courses hither and yon.
He also gets around in style, owning a Gulfstream jet, a
helicopter, a boat, three Harleys, two Jet Skis and a partridge in
a pear tree. OK, we made that last one up. They also pin down
filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola for a Q-and-A and quiz him about
wine. This is the guy who directed The Godfather(beginitalic),
(enditalic)and we're asking him about grapes? Yee-ipes. The
magazine also advises that ``buying a private isle can be hard
work, but the rewards are well worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``VANITY FAIR''
</P>
<P>
   In kind of a neat feature, writer/director Cameron Crowe
interviews Tom Cruise, whom Crowe directed in the smash hit ``Jerry
Maguire.'' The magazine is a little overwrought about this, calling
the Q-and-A style piece ``two days of soul-searching interviews.''
If you say so. Cruise searches his soul and reveals that it was
really fun flying those airplanes in ``Top Gun.'' He also says
these words, about the kabillion of dollars he's making, with a
straight face, ``I get paid because I'm worth it and they should
pay me that much. But I've never worked for money, ever.'' The
piece offers a nice bit of retrospective on Cruise's career.
There's also an interesting excerpt from a new book by cyclist
Lance Armstrong, who beat cancer to win the 1999 Tour de France .

JOSEPH HELLER'S VALEDICTORY HOLDS A MIRROR TO HIMSELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like such embarrassing Hemingway works as ``The Garden of Eden''
and ``True at First Light,'' Joseph Heller's ``Portrait of an
Artist, as an Old Man'' is one of those posthumously published
books that form a sad coda to a distinguished career. Fans of
``Catch-22'' and ``Something Happened'' can only regret that
``Portrait'' was ever published.
</P>
<P>
   Completed before Heller's death last December at 76,
``Portrait'' tells the story of an aging novelist named Eugene Pota
who is having difficulty writing another novel. It reads like one
of those magazine profiles in which a reporter never manages to get
an interview with his subject and so resorts to recounting his own
travails in trying to get the story. The entire book consists of
Pota's complaints about not being able to write, intercut with
outtakes from novels he has decided, for good reason, to abandon.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these abortive efforts are simple testaments to Pota's
failure of imagination. There are weary attempts to rewrite classic
works of literature: Tom Sawyer as a would-be novelist, Tom Sawyer
as rich yuppie with a law degree from Yale, Gregor Samsa as a Wall
Street accountant. Pota contemplates rewriting ``The Iliad'' from
the point of view of the Trojans, toys with writing the biography
of a human gene as a witness to history and proposes a novel
organized as a ``biological map'' of the human body. He has Hera,
the Greek goddess, do a monologue about her philandering husband,
Zeus; and he has Zeus recount a practical joke he played on Hera.
</P>
<P>
   There is something perfunctory about each of Pota's efforts, as
though he couldn't really be bothered fleshing out his characters
or stories. ``Descriptive details of place and character take time,
deplete energy, aren't always necessary,'' Heller writes. ``Worst
of all, we have never been much good with them. Or much good with
intricate plots propelled by swift-paced action.'' In another
chapter he writes of Pota's wife: ``I could develop her easily, but
it's much too hard. It's painstaking and time consuming, and Pota
was short of patience. The generation of writers after him, and the
generation of newer novelists and short story writers following
that one are better at it now and have the gusto and the time. Let
them do it. They can have it.''
</P>
<P>
   The skills Heller did possess in abundance at the height of his
career are also sorely lacking in this novel. There are few
glimpses in ``Portrait'' of his bravura satire or zany,
improvisational humor, and while familiar preoccupations surface in
this volume, they are addressed with none of Heller's old ferocity
and swagger. For instance, the obsession with mortality that
animated so many of his books from ``Catch-22'' through ``Closing
Time'' lies very much at the heart of this novel, but as filtered
through Pota's story it feels less like a terrifying reality or
great existential dilemma, than an old man's narcissistic rant
against declining book sales and a diminished sex life.
</P>
<P>
   Pota goes on at tiresome length about wanting to recapture the
success of his youth: how he wants to write another best seller
that will be ``a natural for the movies,'' how he has a sure-fire
title for a novel (``A Sexual Biography of My Wife'') but doesn't
want to go through the hassle of actually writing it. Though some
of Pota's complaints are vaguely amusing _ he's angry that Nabokov
already wrote ``Lolita,'' instead of leaving the field to him _ his
remarks too often devolve into rationalization or self pity.
</P>
<P>
   He writes a dreary story about the unhappy lives of American
authors _ how the likes of Mark Twain, Jack London, Bret Harte and
Stephen Crane were all beset with financial or medical woes _ and
then delivers an equally dreary, listlike speech about the
declining years of writers like Hemingway, Tennessee Williams and
Truman Capote.
</P>
<P>
   Pota's own name, the book baldly points out, is an acronym for
Portrait of the Artist, and he clearly bears more than a passing
resemblance to his creator. Like Heller, he wrote a memoir about
``his childhood and family life in Coney Island and had interwoven
segments of his war and life experiences afterward into almost all
his novels.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Heller, he achieved fame with a novel based on his service
in World War II and like Heller, he later wrote a novel based on
King David. No doubt the reader is also meant to take Pota's
difficulties in writing another novel as a kind of comment on the
difficulties Heller faced himself: always worrying about repeating
himself, always being compared to his younger self.
</P>
<P>
   There is something sad about Pota's dilemma, _ ``a well-known,
aging author'' struggling so painfully ``to close out his career
with a crowning achievement, with a laudable bang that would
embellish his reputation rather than with a fainthearted whimper.''
Unfortunately it's even sadder that Heller should cap his own
inspired _ and sometimes brilliant _ career with ``Portrait of an
Artist, as an Old Man,'' an anticlimactic book that is, at best, a
poor imitation of a novel.

ENTICING JAPANESE PARENTS TO HELP SPAWN A BABY BOOM 
</HEADLINE>
   By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ In the hallways, bathrooms and lunchroom of the Bandai
Corp., a major Japanese toy maker, the talk these days revolves
around one topic _ an announcement that the company will pay
employees one million yen, or $10,000, for every baby they have
after their second child.
</P>
<P>
   Although many other companies give congratulatory bonuses to
workers who become parents, Bandai is offering the largest baby
bounty in Japan, which is struggling to reverse record-low
birthrates that pose many long-term problems.
</P>
<P>
   Bandai, which makes Power Ranger toys and Tamagotchi electronic
pets, said its incentive was intended to help employees defray the
high cost of raising children and to expand the company's shrinking
customer base _ children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our employees have been speculating on who will be the first
one to take advantage of the offer,'' the deputy general manager,
Yusuke Fukuda, said. ``We realize that it costs more than one
million yen to raise a child from birth to adult. But we are hoping
that this large sum will inspire our employees.''
</P>
<P>
   The offer, which began last month, is part of an effort by the
government and employers to persuade the Japanese, who have one of
the lowest birthrates in the world, to go forth and multiply. Most
initiatives focus on making it easier and more economical to raise
children, extending flexible work hours, family leave and child
care. Some incentives pay cash and monthly subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   A law that goes into effect next month will more than double the
number of preschool children whose parents qualify for monthly
government subsidies. Currently, qualified parents who have
children younger than 3 receive allowances of $50 a month for the
first and second children and $100 a month for every child
thereafter. Under the new law, the subsidies will continue until
the children reach 6.
</P>
<P>
   Welfare officials estimate that 70 percent of preschool children
will qualify for the program, which is restricted to households
with annual incomes of less than $43,000 for self-employed workers
and $67,000 for salaried workers.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the $50 subsidy, though seemingly small,
covered 25 percent of the basic monthly expense, including food,
clothing and utilities for young children. The officials said by
extending the program to age 6 they hoped to alleviate some of the
financial burdens of child rearing. But they flatly denied that the
effort was directly intended to promote childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese government does not meddle in a woman's decision
to have a baby, because that's an individual's personal choice,''
said Tomohiro Onishi, deputy director of the child-rearing
promotion division in the Welfare Ministry. ``But our intention is
to reduce many of the concerns and hesitations that Japanese people
have about having children.''
</P>
<P>
   The government also plans to expand child care to accommodate
the increasing number of working mothers who do not have access to
``affordable'' day care. There are plans to open centers with
longer hours.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear whether those efforts will succeed in raising
the birthrate. Past efforts have had scant effect, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say that what they have done so far has not been
effective,'' said Toshinari Ogino, chief researcher for the
Institute of Labor Administration, a research concern. ``Even with
these new incentives, most Japanese, especially women, feel that
it's just too difficult and expensive to have more than two
children.''
</P>
<P>
   The average birthrate for a Japanese woman was 1.38 children in
1998, a record low for Japan and one of the world's lowest. The
government worries that the declining birthrate and rapidly aging
population will stem economic growth, because there will be fewer
workers to support the growing ranks of the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   The population is 126 million. But demographers estimate that
the number will fall, to 105 million, by 2050, with the median age
expected to increase, from 41 to 49. The proportion of the
population 65 or older is expected to increase from 17 percent to
32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the main factor behind the dropping birthrate is that
Japan remains a traditional society where women are still expected
to work and take care of the household with little participation by
men, Ogino said. With more Japanese women graduating from
universities and obtaining well-paid jobs, many are marrying later
and enjoying their independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japanese women have more options today than ever before, and
they are increasingly saying that they don't want to have a house
full of kids that they alone have to raise,'' Ogino said.
</P>
<P>
   Yutaka and Yoko Takeda, who have two daughters, ages 11 and 8,
said they had long considered having a third child, but that the
weak economy and high education costs had discouraged them. Mr.
Takeda, 45, said if his company offered a bonus like Bandai, he
would strongly consider having another child.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Takeda, 40, said, ``It's just a million yen, and that
wouldn't substantially change our financial situation.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the 950 employees at Bandai have qualified for the
bonus. The company said it had 140 employees with two or more
children. Last year, four employees had their third child, and the
company expects that four or five workers a year will receive the
bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``This problem is not something that can be only resolved with
money,'' Fukuda, the executive, said. ``As a society, we have to
provide a more hospitable environment that facilitates child
rearing.''

PAY PHONES ARE ADAPTING TO THE INTERNET AGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Fla.)   By DENNIS BLANK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pay phone is an endangered species. With cell phones
seemingly in every pocket or briefcase, fewer and fewer people must
rely on phones that are attached, quaintly, to a wall or booth.
</P>
<P>
   There are still 2 million pay phones across the United States,
but that is down by 300,000 the last two years alone.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the companies that make or operate pay phones are
rushing to reinvent themselves, working to change the perception
that pay phones are nothing but black boxes for making calls. New
technology will transform them into tools to provide communications
access to the Internet, find local news and weather and even offer
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, though, economic reality is forcing the removal
of many existing phones. ``For every five telephones we installed
in North Carolina today, we're taking out six,'' said Glenn
Lancaster, president of Triangle Telephone in Cary, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   This shift hurts poor people the most. In many urban areas, at
least 25 percent of low-income residents have no telephone _
cellular or otherwise. The pay phone can be their lifeline,
providing the only way to get help in an emergency, hunt for a job
or call friends.
</P>
<P>
   But when phones are not lucrative, they may be removed. In the
United States the average number of calls for each phone has
declined from 712 a year to 588. And once a given phone does not
yield a profit, phone companies often eliminate it. The cost of
operating pay phones is going up faster than revenue from them,
Lancaster said. He and other operators in North Carolina want the
price of a call raised from 35 cents to 50 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coin-based revenue model is dying fast as pay phone
operators see their coin revenue model drop 20 to 30 percent,''
said Michael J. Boyle, president and chief executive of Elcotel in
Sarasota, Fla., one of the leading pay-phone manufacturers in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to find a way to reinvent themselves,'' said John
Bain, an analyst at Hoak Breedlove Wesneski in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Elcotel is already breaking new ground with 27 software patents
that would transform the black box into a snappy unit with a 5-inch
video screen that provides ads, restaurant listings and access to
``800'' numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategy is move our industry from coins to content,''
Boyle said.
</P>
<P>
   After spending $8 million on research, Elcotel sold 45,000 of
its new Grapevine models for $125 million to Canada Payphone, which
began installing them in March.
</P>
<P>
   In June, new software will be installed to make them
Internet-friendly. Boyle said new revenue would be generated from
advertisers, transaction fees and revenue-sharing agreements. The
new phones can be used with a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   Other manufacturers are also introducing new units. Intellicall
of Dallas introduced units that play audible spots of six seconds
to eight seconds before a call is made.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Suzuka, president and chief executive of Key Factors
Advertising in New York, which is teaming with Intellicall,
estimates that revenue from the average pay phone will rise by $15
a month.
</P>
<P>
   The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is installing 80
new touch-screen units with full Internet access at Kennedy
Airport, said Dennis Novick, president of TCC Teleplex, an
independent pay-telephone supplier.
</P>
<P>
   But he says the old-fashioned pay phone will not die. ``There is
a place for the public pay phone,'' he said _ for those unwilling,
or unable, to join the cellular revolution.

<P>
   The patient was in his 40s, with liver failure, hoping that a
transplant would save his life. But when a severe infection set in
and his kidneys failed, hope ran out. He was taken off the
transplant list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the transplant, his prognosis was death,'' said his
physician, Dr. Susan Dorr Goold, associate director for ethics and
health policy at the University of Michigan Medical School. ``The
question was how.''
</P>
<P>
   Did he want dialysis? A respirator and other aggressive
treatment? He was too ill to answer. And he had left no
instructions or legal documents _ no living will, no durable power
of attorney naming someone else to decide for him.
</P>
<P>
   It could easily have turned into a medical horror story. But it
did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a good death, surrounded by his family,'' Goold said.
``He was comfortable. It was not happy _ he was dying, and young.
But it was not awful.''
</P>
<P>
   How was it done, in an era of high-tech medicine when aggressive
treatment seems to be the norm?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is low-tech and old-fashioned, though by no means
simple: conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to have a serious discussion with his wife about what
she wanted us to do for him, what her goals were,'' Goold said. As
next of kin, the wife was entitled legally to make decisions for
him, even though he had not signed anything to that effect.
</P>
<P>
   They went to a quiet room, and Goold began by asking her what
she understood about her husband's condition. ``She knew he was
doing really poorly, and this was maybe the time to make some hard
decisions,'' Goold said. They spoke for 30 to 45 minutes, when the
wife disclosed that her first husband had also died after a long,
painful illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided not to pursue dialysis or intensive care, not to
prolong the end,'' Goold said. ``That's what most people decide.''
They arranged a second meeting, to which the wife brought family
members, including her teen &UR; - &LR; age children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was beautiful,'' Goold said. ``They were very supportive of
her and her decision to withdraw treatment. They gave her
confidence she was doing the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The absence of a living will or other documents was no
impediment. Although such instructions may help to guide decisions
when patients face terminal illness, doctors say there is no legal
document that can take the place of talking to one another.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph LaBarbera, a lawyer with the New York firm Lifshutz,
Polland &AMP; Hoffman, which specializes in medical issues, said, ``It
has to be a team effort.'' He recommends that while a patient in
the hospital or a nursing home is still competent, the patient and
family meet with a social worker and itemize specifically what the
patient and family will want done if the patient deteriorates.
``The doctor keeps a copy, one is put into the patient's records
and hopefully the relative keeps it as well,'' LaBarbera said. But
even then, he added, written instructions may not be specific
enough. For that reason it is important for the patient to name a
proxy to make decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then the doctor has somebody to talk to,'' LaBarbera said.
``It's often before you get to the resuscitation point that the
problems come up.'' The willingness to talk and to rethink plans is
especially important when patients have illnesses with
unpredictable courses. In some cases, the best option may be to try
treatment like a respirator or a feeding tube, with the
understanding that if it does not work as hoped within a certain
time, it will be discontinued.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joanne Lynn, director of Georgetown University's Center to
Improve Care of the Dying, said: ``We had one patient who
specifically said, `I want a trial of seven days, and if it looks
like I can't come off the ventilator, I want it stopped and I want
to be sedated.' And that's exactly what was done.
</P>
<P>
   ``The patient was sort of vaguely aware. It was explained,
`We've reached this point, and we don't think you can pull through.
Do you want time to think it over?' He held up his hand and sort of
waved.''
</P>
<P>
   The give and take can be harder than it sounds. Goold, who has
had years of practice, said: ``I've seen doctors in training try to
talk to patients about end-of-life issues and totally flub it. I've
heard of people going in and dropping a fatal diagnosis just like a
bomb, and then saying, `So, what do you want us to do if your heart
stops?'''
</P>
<P>
   There is a growing awareness among doctors and patients that too
many people die in pain and fear, cut off from loved ones and from
the chance to come to terms with death and to say goodbyes.
Treating terminally ill patients with kindness, tact and good
medical judgment may come more naturally to some doctors than to
others, but the American Medical Association has decided that the
skills can be learned. The group has developed a two-and-a-half-day
course, ``Education for Physicians on End-of-Life Care.'' So far,
it has been given seven times, in different cities, to groups of
100 to 150 doctors each time.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Linda Emanuel, a creator of the course and vice president
for ethics at the association, said the program coincided with
another trend: the ``renewed search for the heart and soul of
medicine,'' the mission of helping patients that draws many people
to medicine in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of doctors and the public feel that medicine isn't as
caring as it should be and we've lost our way,'' Emanuel said.
``But if you can do care at the end of life, you can do medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The program could be described as a crash course in human
relations and the nuts-and-bolts medical details of taking care of
people whose bodies are shutting down. Participants work in small
groups and are coached on how to break bad news to patients, how to
recognize depression and anxiety and how to help patients and
families plan treatment as illness progresses.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors learn details of pain control that were not taught
in medical school, as well as how to use drugs to ease shortness of
breath, nausea, seizures, agitation and other problems. They are
urged to encourage family members to lie in bed with a dying
patient if they wish, and to tape signs to the patient's door
asking doctors and nurses to leave the family alone for a while.
</P>
<P>
   They are taught how to turn off a respirator in a way that does
not leave the patient gasping for air. They learn how to help
prepare a patient's family for the physical changes that take place
as a person dies. And they talk about their own grief and feelings
of failure when patients die, and ways to avoid burning out.
</P>
<P>
   At a course in March, about half the participants wanted to
spend extra time on pain control, and many were riveted by a
session called ``last hours of living.'' At that session, Dr. Frank
Ferris, medical director for palliative care at the San Diego
Hospice, noted that some dying patients lost the ability to close
their eyes, a condition that most families find quite upsetting.
Could anyone explain it? Ferris asked.
</P>
<P>
   Not one of a dozen doctors in the room could. The explanation,
Ferris said, was that when people waste away, a fat pad behind the
eye also shrinks, causing the eye to sink in and to pull the lid
back with it, leaving the eye partly open.
</P>
<P>
   It was worth knowing, Ferris said, because the simple
explanation could often ease a family's distress.
</P>
<P>
   Although doctors who attended the March session seemed
enthusiastic about the course, some had reservations about the
segment called ``advance care planning.'' Ideally, this part is
supposed to begin when a patient is healthy and is designed to help
doctors and patients determine the treatment patients would want _
or not want _ if they could no longer make their own decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that living wills are often too vague to cover many
real-life situations, the program includes a series of work sheets
or questionnaires given to patients to help them explore their
values and feelings about the kinds of illnesses that most people
dread, including permanent coma, severe dementia, severe stroke and
terminal illness. The work sheets are not meant to be used as legal
documents, but as points of departure for discussions.
</P>
<P>
   The course describes the planning as ``a process, not an
event,'' and says that whenever possible doctors should initiate
conversations with patients when they are well, encourage them to
fill out the work sheets and review and update them periodically.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the discussion that matters, not the piece of paper,''
Ferris said.
</P>
<P>
   The patient's proxy, chosen to make decisions when the patient
cannot, should take part in the discussions, which can occur over
several office visits, rather than taking up too much time at once.
Nurses and social workers can also help, so that doctors do not
have to do it all.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors who attended the course thought the work sheets
were fine in theory, but impractical: too time-consuming for
doctors and too complicated for patients. One doctor said he
preferred the work sheets to plan his own care and that of his
family, but did not think that most doctors or patients would use
them.
</P>
<P>
   But another conference participant, Dr. Michael Stellini of
Wayne State University in Detroit, said he hoped to persuade his
colleagues to try the approach because surveys had shown that the
majority of patients at his hospital wanted to discuss advance care
planning _ but that doctors were not doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Ferris said that doctors who did not want to spend time on
advance care planning with healthy patients would probably wind up
spending even more time on the same issues _ with worse results _
if they put it off until a crisis hit.
</P>
<P>
   And in a lecture at the course, Ferris told doctors that the way
they treated dying patients would set an example for younger
colleagues and dictate how they themselves would be treated at the
end of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all going to die,'' Ferris told his audience. ``Are you
ready for your turn?''

<P>
   What happens to people who have no health-care proxy or living
will, and who wind up being kept alive by machines with little or
no hope of recovery? In New York at least, for life support to be
withdrawn, state law requires ``clear and convincing'' evidence
that the patient would not want such treatment. That requirement
can in effect punish people who never put their wishes into
writing.
</P>
<P>
   But one hospital has made a special effort to help patients who
lack written advance directives. Navah Harlow, director of the
Center for Ethics in Medicine at Beth Israel Medical Center in New
York, said, ``If a patient has told his loved ones what his wishes
would be, and has lived life in a certain way so there is no doubt,
can't we find a way to honor his wishes, to listen to his oral
advance directive, as related by family and friends?''
</P>
<P>
   She and others at the hospital have created a system in which
friends and relatives can meet with her and tell her what they
think or know the patient would have wanted. Then, the case is
presented to an ethics panel.
</P>
<P>
   The process is not fast, and patients sometimes die before it
can be completed. But, Harlow said, it is imperative to go slowly.
``I tell the families, `Let's go through this process, because two
or three months from now you'll be lying in bed, wondering if you
acted too fast, and in the long run this will give you added piece
of mind.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will then ask family members to write me a letter giving me
clear and convincing evidence that this is what they know the
patient would want. This is for the patient's wishes, not the
family's wishes. We honor these oral advance directives. I have
binders full of the most beautiful statements, from people of every
level of education, in many different languages.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Patrick Bedford, a 67-year-old actor from Dublin,
Ireland, who performed on Broadway and in films, was treated for
cancer at Beth Israel and eventually was put on a respirator.
Bedford had no living will or health care proxy, but at Harlow's
suggestion, friends and relatives wrote letters on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Bedford had been an uproarious fellow, a singer and dancer and
storyteller who loved to give parties. One friend said that Bedford
had declared he knew he had a tumor and wanted to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he never wanted to be hooked up to any kind of
machines,'' the friend wrote. ``Let him go to heaven to spin his
tales and tell his stories, to be with all the other cast of
partygoers the way he was meant to be and has not been for the last
couple of weeks and will never be again.''
</P>
<P>
   Another wrote, ``We are certain that a man like Patrick would
not want to be forced to live artificially.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And we also want to respect his life,'' she continued, ``how
he lived it and how he would like to have it end.''
</P>
<P>
   The letters were clear and convincing, Harlow said. But Bedford
died before doctors could act on them.
</P>
<P>
   A PEACEFUL DEATH WITHOUT TUBES
</P>
<P>
   On a crisp, sunny morning a year ago, in the Queens, N.Y.,
apartment that had been her home for more than 40 years, death came
gently for Phyllis Finocchio. Gazing into her husband's eyes, she
squeezed his hand, and then let go of it for the last time.
</P>
<P>
   ``She died very peacefully, the way we wanted it,'' said her
daughter, Bettina, who had helped care for her since 1988, when the
family first learned that Finocchio had Alzheimer's disease. ``And
so as a family, we're at peace.''
</P>
<P>
   In an era of high-tech medicine, a quiet death like Finocchio's
may be harder to arrange than one encumbered by tubes and
machinery, and attended by strangers.
</P>
<P>
   After their decision to care for her at home, one of the
family's most important and most difficult choices came when
Finocchio began to have trouble eating, like many people with
Alzheimer's. Four million Americans have dementia, and most lose
the ability to feed themselves and eventually cannot eat at all,
because of difficulty swallowing.
</P>
<P>
   They begin wasting away, and some doctors and many nursing homes
recommend feeding tubes, which are inserted through the nose or
through an incision in the abdomen.
</P>
<P>
   Families are sometimes pressured into consenting because they
are told that without a tube, their loved ones will die painfully,
from thirst, starvation or choking.
</P>
<P>
   But the Finocchios learned from the Alzheimer's Association,
other medical groups and a hospice program that dying people who
can no longer eat do not suffer from hunger and thirst, and can be
kept comfortable with ice chips and swabs to moisten the mouth and
lips.
</P>
<P>
   The cessation of eating is often a natural part of the process
of dying, and most patients are more comfortable without fluids,
which can cause nausea and increased lung secretions. Dehydration,
described by one doctor as ``nature's anesthetic'' in dying
patients, leads them to lapse into comas and die peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, tube feeding can cause suffering in dementia
patients. It has not been proved to prolong their lives, and it can
cause diarrhea, bloating and infections. It does not prevent
choking, because patients still choke on their own secretions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, demented patients often try to yank out the tubes,
leading to the patients' being placed in restraints. Most then find
the restraints so upsetting that they become agitated and wind up
being sedated.
</P>
<P>
   Bettina Finocchio had seen her mother try to pull out
intravenous lines when she was hospitalized, and knew she would
pull out a feeding tube.
</P>
<P>
   The family decided there would be no tube. They fed Finocchio
when she could no longer feed herself, and froze broth into cubes
to help keep her mouth from becoming parched when she had trouble
swallowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a selfish act,'' Finocchio said. ``It was not an
easy way out. It's very painful to watch someone die like that. But
we just felt it was the best thing for her. I think she would have
wanted it that way.''

 &HT;    Spoleto puts on brave face
 &HT;    By Tom Sabulis
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ Amid the acclaimed opera, the edgy musical
theater, the midnight cocktail parties in cobblestoned alleys and
the breeze-buffeted brunches at historic homes on the Battery,
you'd find it difficult to think of Spoleto Festival USA as
snakebit.
</P>
<P>
   But if ever there was a year for Spoleto sympathy, this is it.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the inaugural weekend kicked off Friday with rebounding
ticket sales and what Spoleto board Chairman Joel Smith III called
``probably the largest crowd at opening ceremonies I've seen,'' the
festival was dealing with the NAACP's tourism boycott of South
Carolina triggered by the Confederate flag issue, which already had
prompted the cancellation of three events starring African-American
performers. And more trouble was around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night on nearby Folly Beach, Antoine Rigot, the
co-founder and artistic director of the French circus Les
Colporteurs, sustained a severe neck injury, forcing the
cancellation of Sunday's and Monday's performances of the troupe's
show ``Filao,'' an aerial fantasy inspired by Italo Calvino's novel
``The Baron in the Trees.'' (``Filao,'' pronounced FIL-ow, is a pun
on the French term for high wire.)
</P>
<P>
   More critical than jeopardizing the show's tour to the North
Carolina Museum of Art and New York's Lincoln Center in coming
months, the accident threatens the career of Rigot, a former Cirque
du Soleil star who helped form Les Colporteurs with Agathe Olivier,
his highwire partner, four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A tightrope phenom, Rigot apparently was hurt ``playing around,
doing circus tricks'' on the beach after a performance Saturday,
said festival spokeswoman Marie Lawson. He underwent surgery early
Sunday at Medical University of South Carolina to relieve pressure
on his spine. Doctors said Rigot's prognosis was good, but it was
too early to predict recovery. The injury was not life-threatening,
but a second surgery will be needed this week in order to fuse two
vertabrae injured in the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Circus management was not releasing other details.
</P>
<P>
   Rigot's accident poses ``a huge problem'' for the festival, said
Spoleto General Director Nigel Redden, who also organizes the
Lincoln Center Festival each summer. Spoleto staff members were
waiting to hear if the circus could restage the 10-person show and
continue performances without Rigot's leading-man presence. Les
Colporteurs has 12 performances left at the festival. Lawson said
all the performances would have sold out by showtime _ that's a
total of 6,600 tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the setbacks, Spoleto put on a brave face on its opening
weekend. As of Monday, ticket sales remained steady for its
carefully curated mix of live cutting-edge creations and vivid new
productions of standards _ the Verdi opera ``Luisa Miller,'' for
instance _ all within walking distance of each other in
Charleston's timeless postcard setting. Some events like the
chamber music concerts, the Colla Marionettes and the circus were
sellouts. Some like Les Grands Ballets Canadiens de Montreal played
to half-full houses.
</P>
<P>
   Audiences were a mixed bag, too, seemingly split between
comitted fans and tourists who showed up for, say, a puppet show,
only to leave upon discovering that the Colla Marionettes'
performance of ``Aida'' was over two hours and in Italian with no
supertitles. (It does, however, pack a sensational special-effects
ending right out of Andrew Lloyd Webber.)
</P>
<P>
   One of the delighted audience members was Marcia Cohen,
professor of painting at the Atlanta College of Art, a self-avowed
``puppet freak'' who drove to Charleston for a day of performances.
She plans to return this weekend to catch the Colla production of
``Around the World in Eighty Days (June 3-11).
</P>
<P>
   Boycott or no boycott, the festival was intent on waving its
diversity flag high.
</P>
<P>
   ``I now understand why the world comes to Spoleto,'' David Henry
Hwang, the Tony-winning playwright (``M Butterfly'') said during
Friday's opening ceremonies, where he filled a prominent spot on
the City Hall balcony. Hwang was at Spoleto for the first time,
having written the libretto for ``The Silver River,'' the 65-minute
chamber opera composed by Shanghai-born Bright Sheng and
choreographed by Muna Tseng. (Its entire run, which ends Sunday, is
sold out.)
</P>
<P>
   A New Yorker, Hwang hailed Spoleto's role as artistic incubator
and its commitment to adventurous work like ``The Silver River,''
based on a 4,000-year-old Chinese legend about the love of a god
for a mortal and the origins of night and day. ``The festival
offers wonderful support without a whole lot of interference,''
Hwang said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about performing during the boycott, Tseng, born in Hong
Kong, said: ``My personal view is that we change things through
dialogue, meeting and discussion. Silence is death. Absence is
death.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathryn Hunter, star of the Shared Experience Theatre's
production of Bertolt Brecht's ``Mother Courage and Her Children''
(through June 11) said the boycott presented her London-based
company with ``a Brechtian dilemma. He asks you to make choices and
they're difficult. But Spoleto is such an extraordinary
bringing-together of people. Anything that threatens it is a
pity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mother Courage'' cast member Nicholas Bailey is one of the few
blacks performing at Spoleto this year. ``I had no real
reservations about coming,'' he said. ``I'm thinking more about the
implications of doing a political piece. I recognize the
significance of the flag _ I have //right?//some relatives here. As
a black from England, though, my experience over there is very
different from being here.''
</P>
<P>
   Racial politics and the artistic juxtaposition of old and new
were not the only constants running through Spoleto's opening days:
The air-conditioning was on the blink at various venues. ``Another
little theme of this year's festival,'' a stoic Redden said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Actress Hunter was battling a chest infection brought on, she
said, by the temperamental cooling system in her guest quarters on
Folly Beach, and by the stifling weather, in general. ``I had
forgotten how much you perspire,'' she said, as she downed flu
medicine and tried to preserve energy for the three-hour ``Mother
Courage'' performance. Still, she refused to cancel an interview.
Instead, she wondered aloud about making her British accent more
accessible to Spoleto audiences. And she couldn't stop talking
about the ``magical'' Colla Marionettes, whom she saw on her day
off.
</P>
<P>
   One of the unticketed treats of Spoleto is running into artists
at performances other than their own. If it's not Mother Courage
herself at the marionettes, it's dancers at the opera, or opera
singers at the ballet. In the words of festival board member Eric
Friberg, Spoleto's opening weekend has become ``like one gigantic
house party'' _ which is exactly what Friberg will throw next
weekend for Atlanta friends in his Revolutionary War-era home on
Legare Street. ``Some folks just go from mimosas to cocktail party
to cast party,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Friberg is a director at Mckinsey &AMP; Co., the Atlanta-based
consulting firm that has done pro bono planning work for Spoleto,
as well as for the Atlanta Opera and the High Museum of Art, whose
boards he oversees? He was confident that a
less-than-recordbreaking year at the box office will not damage
Spoleto's future. ``We'll get through it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you wonder about the festival's future considering the
economic pressure, the mostly outdated venues and the nagging sense
that after 24 years, the local populace is growing a bit
complacent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spoleto is good for business,'' said Phil Slotin, owner of
Birlant &AMP; Co. antiques on King Street, who had a ``Spoleto Sale''
poster in his store window. ``I'm not badmouthing it at all, but I
think it has lost some of its glitter in recent years.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, you'd be hardpressed to find others to agree with
that this weekend. As playwright Hwang said, ``During Spoleto,
Charleston is the artistic crossroads of the world.''

<P>
   The patient was in his 40s, with liver failure, hoping that a
transplant would save his life. But when a severe infection set in
and his kidneys failed, hope ran out. He was taken off the
transplant list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the transplant, his prognosis was death,'' said his
physician, Dr. Susan Dorr Goold, associate director for ethics and
health policy at the University of Michigan Medical School. ``The
question was how.''
</P>
<P>
   Did he want dialysis? A respirator and other aggressive
treatment? He was too ill to answer. And he had left no
instructions or legal documents _ no living will, no durable power
of attorney naming someone else to decide for him.
</P>
<P>
   It could easily have turned into a medical horror story. But it
did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a good death, surrounded by his family,'' Goold said.
``He was comfortable. It was not happy _ he was dying, and young.
But it was not awful.''
</P>
<P>
   How was it done, in an era of high-tech medicine when aggressive
treatment seems to be the norm?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is low-tech and old-fashioned, though by no means
simple: conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to have a serious discussion with his wife about what
she wanted us to do for him, what her goals were,'' Goold said. As
next of kin, the wife was entitled legally to make decisions for
him, even though he had not signed anything to that effect.
</P>
<P>
   They went to a quiet room, and Goold began by asking her what
she understood about her husband's condition. ``She knew he was
doing really poorly, and this was maybe the time to make some hard
decisions,'' Goold said. They spoke for 30 to 45 minutes, when the
wife disclosed that her first husband had also died after a long,
painful illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided not to pursue dialysis or intensive care, not to
prolong the end,'' Goold said. ``That's what most people decide.''
They arranged a second meeting, to which the wife brought family
members, including her teen-age children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was beautiful,'' Goold said. ``They were very supportive of
her and her decision to withdraw treatment. They gave her
confidence she was doing the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The absence of a living will or other documents was no
impediment. Although such instructions may help to guide decisions
when patients face terminal illness, doctors say there is no legal
document that can take the place of talking to one another.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph LaBarbera, a lawyer with the New York firm Lifshutz,
Polland &AMP; Hoffman, which specializes in medical issues, said, ``It
has to be a team effort.'' He recommends that while a patient in
the hospital or a nursing home is still competent, the patient and
family meet with a social worker and itemize specifically what the
patient and family will want done if the patient deteriorates.
``The doctor keeps a copy, one is put into the patient's records
and hopefully the relative keeps it as well,'' LaBarbera said. But
even then, he added, written instructions may not be specific
enough. For that reason it is important for the patient to name a
proxy to make decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then the doctor has somebody to talk to,'' LaBarbera said.
``It's often before you get to the resuscitation point that the
problems come up.'' The willingness to talk and to rethink plans is
especially important when patients have illnesses with
unpredictable courses. In some cases, the best option may be to try
treatment like a respirator or a feeding tube, with the
understanding that if it does not work as hoped within a certain
time, it will be discontinued.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joanne Lynn, director of Georgetown University's Center to
Improve Care of the Dying, said: ``We had one patient who
specifically said, `I want a trial of seven days, and if it looks
like I can't come off the ventilator, I want it stopped and I want
to be sedated.' And that's exactly what was done.
</P>
<P>
   ``The patient was sort of vaguely aware. It was explained,
`We've reached this point, and we don't think you can pull through.
Do you want time to think it over?' He held up his hand and sort of
waved.''
</P>
<P>
   The give and take can be harder than it sounds. Goold, who has
had years of practice, said: ``I've seen doctors in training try to
talk to patients about end-of-life issues and totally flub it. I've
heard of people going in and dropping a fatal diagnosis just like a
bomb, and then saying, `So, what do you want us to do if your heart
stops?'''
</P>
<P>
   There is a growing awareness among doctors and patients that too
many people die in pain and fear, cut off from loved ones and from
the chance to come to terms with death and to say goodbyes.
Treating terminally ill patients with kindness, tact and good
medical judgment may come more naturally to some doctors than to
others, but the American Medical Association has decided that the
skills can be learned. The group has developed a two-and-a-half-day
course, ``Education for Physicians on End-of-Life Care.'' So far,
it has been given seven times, in different cities, to groups of
100 to 150 doctors each time.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Linda Emanuel, a creator of the course and vice president
for ethics at the association, said the program coincided with
another trend: the ``renewed search for the heart and soul of
medicine,'' the mission of helping patients that draws many people
to medicine in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of doctors and the public feel that medicine isn't as
caring as it should be and we've lost our way,'' Emanuel said.
``But if you can do care at the end of life, you can do medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The program could be described as a crash course in human
relations and the nuts-and-bolts medical details of taking care of
people whose bodies are shutting down. Participants work in small
groups and are coached on how to break bad news to patients, how to
recognize depression and anxiety and how to help patients and
families plan treatment as illness progresses.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors learn details of pain control that were not taught
in medical school, as well as how to use drugs to ease shortness of
breath, nausea, seizures, agitation and other problems. They are
urged to encourage family members to lie in bed with a dying
patient if they wish, and to tape signs to the patient's door
asking doctors and nurses to leave the family alone for a while.
</P>
<P>
   They are taught how to turn off a respirator in a way that does
not leave the patient gasping for air. They learn how to help
prepare a patient's family for the physical changes that take place
as a person dies. And they talk about their own grief and feelings
of failure when patients die, and ways to avoid burning out.
</P>
<P>
   At a course in March, about half the participants wanted to
spend extra time on pain control, and many were riveted by a
session called ``last hours of living.'' At that session, Dr. Frank
Ferris, medical director for palliative care at the San Diego
Hospice, noted that some dying patients lost the ability to close
their eyes, a condition that most families find quite upsetting.
Could anyone explain it? Ferris asked.
</P>
<P>
   Not one of a dozen doctors in the room could. The explanation,
Ferris said, was that when people waste away, a fat pad behind the
eye also shrinks, causing the eye to sink in and to pull the lid
back with it, leaving the eye partly open.
</P>
<P>
   It was worth knowing, Ferris said, because the simple
explanation could often ease a family's distress.
</P>
<P>
   Although doctors who attended the March session seemed
enthusiastic about the course, some had reservations about the
segment called ``advance care planning.'' Ideally, this part is
supposed to begin when a patient is healthy and is designed to help
doctors and patients determine the treatment patients would want _
or not want _ if they could no longer make their own decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that living wills are often too vague to cover many
real-life situations, the program includes a series of work sheets
or questionnaires given to patients to help them explore their
values and feelings about the kinds of illnesses that most people
dread, including permanent coma, severe dementia, severe stroke and
terminal illness. The work sheets are not meant to be used as legal
documents, but as points of departure for discussions.
</P>
<P>
   The course describes the planning as ``a process, not an
event,'' and says that whenever possible doctors should initiate
conversations with patients when they are well, encourage them to
fill out the work sheets and review and update them periodically.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the discussion that matters, not the piece of paper,''
Ferris said.
</P>
<P>
   The patient's proxy, chosen to make decisions when the patient
cannot, should take part in the discussions, which can occur over
several office visits, rather than taking up too much time at once.
Nurses and social workers can also help, so that doctors do not
have to do it all.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors who attended the course thought the work sheets
were fine in theory, but impractical: too time-consuming for
doctors and too complicated for patients. One doctor said he
preferred the work sheets to plan his own care and that of his
family, but did not think that most doctors or patients would use
them.
</P>
<P>
   But another conference participant, Dr. Michael Stellini of
Wayne State University in Detroit, said he hoped to persuade his
colleagues to try the approach because surveys had shown that the
majority of patients at his hospital wanted to discuss advance care
planning _ but that doctors were not doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Ferris said that doctors who did not want to spend time on
advance care planning with healthy patients would probably wind up
spending even more time on the same issues _ with worse results _
if they put it off until a crisis hit.
</P>
<P>
   And in a lecture at the course, Ferris told doctors that the way
they treated dying patients would set an example for younger
colleagues and dictate how they themselves would be treated at the
end of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all going to die,'' Ferris told his audience. ``Are you
ready for your turn?''

   LEBANON-PRISON _ BEIRUT, Lebanon _ Until she her release during
the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, Journalism student Cosette
Ibrihim spent 9 months in the notorious Al-Khaim prison, run by
Israel's allies, the South Lebanon Army. She said that as a
Christian and the objects of an international human rights cause,
she received ``lenient treatment'' a month of interrogations and
beatings, no trials or lawyers. ``Here,'' here captors told her,
``You defend yourself.'' Lebanese are debating whether to turn the
hill top prison into a museum or turn it into a prison for
collaborators. Inmates there in the '80s describe days chained to
electrical posts, sessions of dowsings with extremely hot or
extremely cold water. While her country celebrates Israel's
withdrawal, Ibrihim is suffering from stress, aggravated ulcers and
exhaustion. She's bitter and unsure of what to do with her life.

TEL AVIV JUDGE DELAYS RULING ON RELEASE OF HEZBOLLAH LEADERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV, Israel _ A court here delayed a decision Monday on
whether to release two abducted Lebanese guerrilla leaders whose
freedom has been demanded by Hezbollah as a condition for halting
anti-Israeli hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Uri Goren of the Tel Aviv District Court said he would
rule on July 12 on the cases of Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid of
Hezbollah, or Party of God, and Mustafa Dirani of the Amal
movement, who have been held without trial since they were forcibly
taken from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Obeid, 43, was seized in 1989, and Dirani, 49, was taken in 1994
_ both as bargaining chips for the release of Capt. Ron Arad, an
Israeli airman whose plane went down over Lebanon in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The court hearing Monday was the first time the men had appeared
in public since their abduction. Earlier hearings were behind
closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a full gray beard and a large white skullcap, Obeid sat
next to the bearded Dirani as both men followed the proceedings
through an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah leaders have asserted that they will continue fighting
Israel until it releases the two guerrillas and other Lebanese
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. special envoy to the Middle East, Terje Roed Larsen,
who is verifying the Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon, said on
Sunday that Israel's release of the Lebanese prisoners ``would give
an additional impetus to the restoration of international peace and
security in the area.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Obeid and Dirani, Israeli authorities say they are
holding 15 other Lebanese prisoners, who have been convicted of
attacks in the former Israeli-held zone in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister David Levy said Monday that none of the
prisoners could be released at this time and that everything
depended on whether quiet would prevail along the Israeli-Lebanese
border.
</P>
<P>
   The court hearing Monday centered on the question of whether
Obeid and Dirani posed a danger to Israeli security.
</P>
<P>
   Following a Supreme Court ruling last month that barred holding
Lebanese prisoners as bargaining chips, the government has argued
that Obeid and Dirani should stay in jail because they pose a
security risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've become a symbol for the struggle of the terrorist
organizations against Israel,'' said Devora Chen, the government
attorney. ``If they are released, they will continue to play an
active role in the terrorist organizations and go back to very
senior positions there.''
</P>
<P>
   Zvi Rish, the lawyer for the guerrillas, responded that now that
Israel has withdrawn from Lebanon, his clients no longer pose a
risk, because they had vowed to fight Israel until it pulled out.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``When they leave Lebanon, that's the end,'' he quoted Obeid as
saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're talking about state security, it could be that the
danger lies in the very continuation of their imprisonment,'' Rish
told the judge, alluding to the Hezbollah threats to fight on if
the prisoners are not freed.
</P>
<P>
   Obeid and Dirani, in remarks reported by their lawyer and
translator, sounded a similar warning, saying their continued
imprisonment could lead to increased tension and anti-Israeli
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of Monday's hearing, Dirani asked to give his version
of the disappearance of Arad, whom he held prisoner before the
airman vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking briefly before he was cut off by the judge, Dirani said
that the airman was ``stolen'' by Iranian Revolutionary Guards in
the Bekaa region in April 1988 when his captors left him in a rush
to identify bodies of guerrillas killed in an Israeli attack on the
village of Maidun. Dirani said he had made a ``great effort'' to
recover the airman, but Israel ``complicated the situation'' and
assassinated the Hezbollah leader Sheik Abbas Musawi.
</P>
<P>
   Goren ruled that given ``the newness of the issue'' and in order
to examine further arguments made Monday, he would decide the case
on July 12. Until then, he said, the guerrilla leaders will remain
in jail.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Sizzling heat will broil the Southwest and southern Plains
Tuesday as a broad, warm ridge of high pressure several thousand
feet aloft expands east toward the Mississippi Valley. Temperatures
will soar to 100 degrees in parts of western Kansas and southern
Nebraska as heated breezes descending the Rockies supplement heat
associated with the warm ridge.
</P>
<P>
   A few thunderstorms will erupt near the Big Bend of Texas as
moisture invades northward from Mexico. Save for isolated
thunderstorms associated with the sea-breeze front near the coast
of south Texas, the rest of the region will be shielded from
thunderstorms by a layer of very warm air at altitudes near 5,000
feet.
</P>
<P>
   A cluster of potent thunderstorms, some approaching severe
levels, will erupt over parts of eastern Wyoming and western
Nebraska later Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: TORRID TALLAHASSEE
</P>
<P>
   The mercury soared to 100 degrees in Tallahassee, Fla., on
Sunday. Late spring and early summer mark, on average, the city's
warmest period. By midsummer, the burly Bermuda high has
established firm footing over the eastern Atlantic. In turn, its
persistent air circulation keeps southerly winds over the Florida
panhandle, boosting humidity and fostering flocks of cumulus clouds
that keep high temperatures mostly in the 90s.

AFTER YEARS OF DECLINE, LABOR IS BACK AS A POLITICAL FORCE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite the American labor movement's loss in the bruising
battle over the China trade bill, supporters and opponents say that
after years of decline, it has once again become a powerful
political force.
</P>
<P>
   It provided important political muscle that helped Vice
President Al Gore become the presumptive Democratic presidential
nominee, and will likely by a major force for the Democratic Party
in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   After many people wrote off labor as an irrelevant, toothless
dinosaur, the AFL-CIO has displayed considerable muscle on Capitol
Hill by stopping fast-track trade legislation and by helping push
through a higher minimum wage and the Family and Medical Leave Act.
</P>
<P>
   In other signs of promise, white-collar workers, including
doctors and psychologists, are flocking into unions as never
before, and labor registered its biggest organizing victory in 60
years by unionizing 74,000 Los Angeles home-care workers.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this rebound has been engineered by John J. Sweeney, who
was elected president of the AFL-CIO four-and-a-half years ago on a
platform of reviving labor after its membership and clout had
slipped steadily for two decades. To rebuild labor, Sweeney has
focused on attracting new members, and as the foremost evidence of
a turnaround, he points to last year's 265,000 jump in union
membership _ by far the largest increase since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas J. Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
said it would be foolish for anyone to think that labor was weak
because the House of Representatives defied labor last week and
approved permanent normal trade relations for China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who stands up and says, `We won this thing by a couple
of votes and therefore labor is weak,' they don't know how to
count,'' said Donohue, who led the corporate fight for the trade
bill. ``Labor has a lot of money. Labor has a lot of forces on the
ground. Anyone who wants to declare them weak, just look out for
the next fight.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the 13-million member labor federation has pledged to
put together its biggest army of of campaign volunteers _ tens of
thousands who will distribute literature at work places and make
millions of get-out-the-vote phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO's endorsement of Gore gave him a much-needed boost
in the Democratic presidential primaries, with union foot soldiers
helping him trounce former Sen. Bill Bradley in the Iowa caucuses
and capture a much narrower win in the New Hampshire primary.
Political experts give labor much of the credit for accomplishments
ranging from Gray Davis' gubernatorial victory in California, to
Charles Schumer's triumph over Alfonse D'Amato for New York's
Senate seat, to the Democrats' surprising success in gaining House
seats in the 1998 mid-term election.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like night and day comparing the AFL-CIO's political
operations today with those in the 1994 elections,'' said Charles
Cook, who publishes a nonpartisan political report. ``It's like
comparing a Model T with a Ferrari.''
</P>
<P>
   But labor has a long way to go to regain the economic might it
had in the 1950s. Back then, 35 percent of the nation's work force
belonged to unions; compared with 13.9 percent today. The sectors
where unions have been strongest traditionally, like steel,
automobiles, mining and apparel, have been losing jobs the fastest,
while the sectors where unions have had the least representation,
like high technology, finance and fast food, are those growing the
fastest.
</P>
<P>
   Organized labor is losing about half the elections where workers
vote on whether to unionize, as many corporations mount aggressive
and expensive campaigns that pressure workers not to join unions.
As a result of such corporate tactics, unions now represent less
than one in 10 private-sector workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The labor movement has done very well in the public sector,
organizing government employees, but in the private sector, it is
still very difficult,'' said Richard Hurd, a labor relations
professor at Cornell University.
</P>
<P>
   Labor faces some other problems _ the occasional embarrassing
episodes of union corruption, repeated Republican efforts to weaken
unions, and internal feuding among union leaders over political
strategy and trade. Businesses contribute 15 times as much in
campaign money as does labor and many Democrats still keep their
distance, fearful of accusations that they are in Big Labor's
pocket. And for all their efforts, they lost the fight they had
cared the most about over the past few years _ the China trade
bill.
</P>
<P>
   With union membership falling by nearly one fourth between 1979
and 1995, Sweeney has made attracting more members his No. 1
priority. He often cites studies showing that labor's declining
power is a major reason that after-inflation wages have declined
for most workers over the past quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney has advocated more militant tactics for labor, like
those used by thousands of striking janitors in Los Angeles who
repeatedly blocked traffic last month to draw attention to their
meager wages. He has also worked to reduce labor's unwanted
reputation as a ``special interest'' by having it focus more on
helping low-wage workers and by forming alliances with religious
leaders, environmentalists, immigrant groups and college students
who oppose sweatshops.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Sweeney has a commitment to reach out to those who have
been largely bypassed by the labor movement,'' said the Rev. Howard
Hubbard, the Roman Catholic bishop of Albany, N.Y., who has helped
lead efforts to rebuild the clergy's once-strong ties with labor.
``He's reached out to the forgotten workers _ child-care workers,
nurses' aides, janitors, people at the low end of the scale. He's
made a commitment to show solidarity with the poorest workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney has used his bully pulpit to urge the AFL-CIO's 68
member unions to hire more organizers and to spend millions of
dollars more each year on recruiting. Nonetheless, in his first
three years at labor's helm, union membership slid by 150,000 as
many unionized workers retired or companies closed unionized
factories and moved operations overseas.
</P>
<P>
   But Sweeney's ambitions seemed to pay off last year when the
Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that union ranks grew by
265,000.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders say they hope those gains are not a one-time blip,
but the start of a long-term upswing, although many labor experts
say the jury is still out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're starting to turn the corner,'' Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we've had significant progress in terms of organizing,
we still have to do a lot more. We can't rest on modest growth.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His ambitious _ some say unrealistic _ goal is for unions to
organize 1 million new members each year, meaning there might be a
net gain of 500,000 members after layoffs and retirements.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a huge obstacle. Only a handful of unions, most
notably the Service Employees International Union and the Hotel
Employees and Restaurant Employees Union, are operating on all
eight cylinders to attract more workers. Sweeney wishes that more
unions copied the union he once headed, the Service Employees,
which devotes 45 percent of its budget to organizing _ 10 times the
percentage of many unions. That union recruited 155,000 workers
last year, many of them janitors and hospital employees, the most
any union has attracted in one year since 1918.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still tremendous inertia among certain unions,'' said
Kent Wong, a labor relations professor at the University of
California at Los Angeles. ``The level of activism among some
unions has changed dramatically, but many unions are having
tremendous difficulties changing.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to woo immigrant workers, Sweeney has gotten the
labor movement to reverse its long-held position and embrace,
rather than oppose, the wave of immigrants. In the 1980s unions
were convinced that immigrants were driving down wages so labor
backed a law that punished employers who hire illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   But this year the AFL-CIO has called for ending such employer
sanctions and granting amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants.
Labor changed direction because it views immigrants as a natural
audience for its message and because it sees many employers taking
advantage of illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   One welcome development for labor is the surprising surge in
interest shown by white-collar workers. With managed care squeezing
their incomes and professional freedom, thousands of doctors are
joining unions; in New York state, 3,000 psychologists have
unionized. So have 10,000 podiatrists and more than 20,000 customer
services workers at United Airlines and U.S. Airways.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of IBM workers showed interest in unionizing last year
after their company sought to cut their pensions. And even a few
dozen workers at Microsoft called for a union because they were
angry about being long-term temporary workers, with few benefits,
rather than permanent staffers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of industries, because of the way things are
changing, people realize they need some form of collective voice,''
said Sweeney. ``People are seeing the problems they're confronted
with are too big to resolve by themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the China trade battle, one of Sweeney's biggest
problems is that many political and business leaders have pegged
him as protectionist and anti-trade. These critics misunderstand
his position, he insists.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that past trade accords have helped business but not
labor, he said he told the Clinton administration that the AFL-CIO
would oppose any trade agreement that did not protect workers
rights. So when Sweeney saw that the administration's trade deal
with China contained no worker protections, he saw no choice but to
oppose it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think trade is good for our country,'' Sweeney said. ``It's
important to our successful economy. We recognize that
globalization is here to stay, so the question is, How do workers
around the world share in the fruits of globalization?''

ADVERTISING: ACLU TURNS TO CONSUMER MARKETING 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICIA WINTERS LAURO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The advertisement features a photograph of Martin Luther King
Jr. on the left and one of Charles Manson on the right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man on the left is 75 times more likely to be stopped by
the police while driving than the man on the right,'' says the
headline in bold-faced type. The ad goes on to explain that around
the United States, police regularly stop drivers based on their
skin color rather than on the way they are driving.
</P>
<P>
   The paid ad _ which begins running on Sunday in The New York
Times Magazine and the next day in The New Yorker _ is a message
from the American Civil Liberties Union. Founded in 1920 and
probably best remembered _ at least by baby boomers _ for its role
during the anti-Vietnam war protests of the '60s and '70s, the ACLU
is taking a consumer marketing approach to build new awareness and
support for its causes.
</P>
<P>
   And consumer-style advertising and Web-based marketing _
including a Web store _ are all part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't reach a significant number of people by only
speaking at bar associations and Elks lodges and universities,''
said Ira Glasser, the ACLU's executive director in New York.
``Advertising and Web-based communication has to be part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have taken to advertising for the same reason people who
market products have taken to advertising in a dramatic and splashy
and visible way,'' he added. ``We want to get the message into
people's consciousness without forcing them to have to read a Law
Review article.''
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU has advertised in the past, but its approach has either
been event-driven _ such as its advertising of the mass arrests of
anti-war protesters _ or, in recent years, all text ads about
issues that ran on Op-ed pages in newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   But the group's polling found that the ACLU was still largely
misunderstood, Glasser said. The group is often remembered for its
most sensational and titillating cases _ like defending the
free-speech rights of the Ku Klux Klan _ and not for the other
5,000 to 6,000 cases handled each year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, people don't know what the ACLU does, and they have
a rather distorted image of what the organization stands for,''
said Glasser. ``This is also an attempt to educate people about the
issues and inform the public of our core values.''
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU late last year hired DeVito/Verdi in New York _ its
first consumer ad agency, and one that is known for its provocative
work for clients like ecampus.com and causes like the Pro-Choice
Public Education Project. The agency also creates advertising for
Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign for a U.S. Senate seat from New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Glasser said he hopes the advertising will draw people to its
Web site, which offers information on a host of issues. The site's
store sells books and items like ACLU T-shirts, caps and mugs as
another way to create awareness and eventually produce some income.
</P>
<P>
   Racial profiling is just one of the issues that the ACLU is
focusing on in advertising. The group will also run ads supporting
abortion rights and gay rights and will take aim at a growing
national movement to try juveniles as adults. The last of these
uses the headline: ``They finally found an answer to overcrowded
prisons. Smaller prisoners.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ellis Verdi, president of DeVito/Verdi, said all of the issues
``resonated with people'' in its polling as important topics of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   Actually the ads are the second phase of the campaign, which was
launched in December with a print ad on the death of Amadou Diallo,
an unarmed New York man who was killed by police in a fusillade of
41 bullets.
</P>
<P>
   The ad was condemned by New York's Patrolmen's Benevolent
Association as prejudicial pretrial publicity, and was later cited
by a judge as among the reasons for a change in venue of the trial
from the city to upstate New York. The ACLU maintains that the ad
did not take a legal position but only highlighted ``the latest
unjustified killing of a person of color.''
</P>
<P>
   Racial profiling is a volatile issue around the country, but it
is unclear whether police groups will respond to this latest ad.
The National Association of Police Organizations, a coalition of
police unions and associations in Washington, was unavailable for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Diallo ad was risky and was criticized. But Victor Kamber,
president of the Kamber Group in Washington, which creates advocacy
advertising for labor unions and other causes, said that the ACLU's
campaign needs to be controversial to provoke its ``liberal,
progressive and somewhat shrinking'' audience to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they are advertising to get general public
recognition,'' said Kamber. ``If they wanted that, they'd run a
neutral ad about how they support good causes. Their goal is to get
people angry and excited, and I think they achieved it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Verdi said the agency is not setting out to be
controversial, although it does want to get noticed. The ACLU has a
$1 million ad budget _ big for them but minuscule by Madison Avenue
standards, said Glasser.
</P>
<P>
   ``A public service ad has to move you emotionally and
intellectually,'' said Verdi. ``If you don't get a chill, it's a
total waste of money.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Question: I have job offers for similar positions
from two very different companies. One is a large and
well-established firm that offers a career path, stability,
training, and great benefits. The other one is not quite a
start-up, but it is less structured, less organized, and yet offers
more variety, more challenge, more potential opportunity, and more
risk. I keep changing my mind, and I don't know which one to take.
Do you have any suggestions? K.R.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: This is a very individual decision, and you are the very
individual to make it. The fact that you are stuck is not uncommon
for people in this type of situation.
</P>
<P>
   In order to get yourself unstuck, there are three key places to
look. One is the well-established company, the second is the
quasi-start-up company, and the third one is in the mirror. In
terms of the companies, try to spend more time at each. In these
follow-up visits, try to talk to a good number of people,
particularly those with whom you would be working.
</P>
<P>
   You also have to look deeply into yourself. One approach is to
try to list the key components of your most satisfying and
personally rewarding previous work experiences. In many respects,
this listing will help spell out some of your key work motivators.
The next step is to match up these motivators with what you have
learned from your follow-up visits to the two companies.
</P>
<P>
   It may also help to imagine yourself getting up at the crack of
dawn a month from now and heading to a job at each of these
companies. If you get a tinge of queasiness about one, and easiness
about the other, something deep within you is sending an important
message.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I work with three other administrative assistants who support
eight professionals. I get along well with them, and I am very good
at what I do. The problem is that one of the other administrative
assistants frequently gets behind and asks me to help her out. I
have done so on many occasions, but this makes a huge amount of
work for me, and it's been happening more and more lately. She is
becoming a real problem for me. M.C.
</P>
<P>
   A: It certainly sounds like she is becoming a real problem, but
the reality is that you are part of the problem too. You have been
a supportive, helpful, caring, and likable colleague, and that is
commendable.
</P>
<P>
   However, by always being there to help your associate and bail
her out every time she falls behind, you may have inadvertently
removed any incentive, desire, or motivation for her to improve. In
a buzzword, you have played an enabling role. You have provided
such a comfortable safety net for her that she would rather jump
into it than jump into her job.
</P>
<P>
   This does not mean that you should not help her any more, but it
does mean that you should spend more time doing your work, and less
time doing hers. The next time that she comes to you for a bailout,
you can still provide some direct help, but try to put more
emphasis on demonstrating how to get the work done. If you truly
want to help her, you should do so as her mentor, not as her
savior.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several of us were sitting at lunch talking about salaries
around here when our manager walked by, heard what we were talking
about, and got all upset and said we will be disciplined if we
continue. Can she do this? M.B.
</P>
<P>
   A: When a manager makes a comment like that to the employees, it
is actually the manager who should be disciplined. Under most
circumstances, employees have the right to talk about salaries.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of the bigger picture, one has to wonder about the
skills of a manager who wanders through the lunch room and jumps
into private conversations with threats of discipline unless
discussions about pay are squelched immediately. This is not the
best way to build morale, motivation, commitment, and productivity.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a trend in the workplace, it is for companies to
openly and candidly provide the employees with a broad range of
financial information. This trend, referred to as open book
management, is premised on the belief that employees are key
resources who should not only be kept informed on the company's
financial situation, but also provided with opportunities to
present their inputs in this area.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of managing by wandering around is very important as
managerial effectiveness can clearly be improved through increased
contact and communication with the employees. An informal visit at
lunch can definitely help, but the idea is to provide food for
thought, rather than stirring things up.

<P>
   BOSTON _ After 14 years in the beer-making business, Richard
Doyle, a founder of the Mass. Bay Brewing Co., no longer pays much
attention to the humid, bready scent of barley malt and yeast
bubbling over into foam-topped buckets. But the smell is still
comforting, reminding him that the brewery is running all out,
producing nearly 2 million gallons of Harpoon beer a year.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle recently added a sixth 24-hour production day to the
brewery's workweek. Indeed, business is as good as it ever was at
the height of the specialty beer boom in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But some of his colleagues in the Massachusetts microbrewing
industry have not been so fortunate. Local brewers like Bristol,
Middlesex, Pilgrim and Old Newbury have all closed their doors.
Thinking back on the boom, Doyle, who is also chairman of the
Brewers Association of America, described the rush to market as a
busy intersection without a traffic light.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was so much product going through, it was just
crashing,'' he said. ``We needed time to kind of tow it all away.''
</P>
<P>
   The craze in the 1990s for craft-brewed beers with a variety of
interesting tastes (and names) suddenly jammed store aisles with
fanciful brews like Laughing Skull Bohemian Pilsner, Long Trail
Double Bag Ale, Rogue Shakespeare Stout and Pig's Eye Pilsner. For
consumers used to basic labels like Coors and Bud, it was a bit too
much. Some microbrewers collided head-on with distributors who
refused to carry their products and financiers who clamored for
profits even as sales slowed.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, for the first time, more microbreweries in the
United States closed last year than opened. And more bottles will
head for the clearance shelves this year.
</P>
<P>
   But those craft brewers that lived through the shake-up _ and
there are many _ are telling a tale of leaner, more economical
brewing, more conservative growth, and more thoughtful business
plans. They are taking a breather before making another, more sober
run on the American beer market, which is dominated by three
companies _ Anheuser-Busch, Miller Brewing, a unit of Philip
Morris, and Coors _ that have 80 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, these independent beer makers say, they are paying
more respect to their roots. The craft beer industry grew at a
euphoric rate of 50 percent in both 1994 and 1995, spurring some
regional brewers _ heady as prom queens with their local popularity
_ to rush their products into new markets. But when growth stalled
in 1997 and 1998, many retreated to their home states and the
comforting loyalty of customers in their own backyards.
</P>
<P>
   Deschutes Brewery of Bend, Ore., stopped shipments to Colorado
and San Diego. Pyramid of Seattle and the Breckenridge Brewing Co.
in Denver cut back on their out-of-state attempts as well.
</P>
<P>
   What they found, said David Edgar, president of the Institute
for Brewing Studies in Colorado, is that beer drinkers in Oregon
have a special affection for their Black Butte Porter, and
Alabamans stick with their Red Mountain Red Ale.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry will always be primarily about local beers,'' he
said. ``The lesson was learned that just because you were the cat's
meow in Portland doesn't mean that automatically consumers are
going to embrace your brand as strongly in Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shipyard Brewing Co. in Maine, for one, began on the
Kennebunk River in 1992, but within a few years expanded into New
York, New Jersey, Maryland, Chicago, Florida and parts of Virginia.
Then sales slumped. Shipyard retrenched to New England, where it
currently sells 75 percent of its product. Fred Forsely, its
co-founder, hasn't given up thoughts of going national, but
meanwhile he is coping with ``being able to accept a small piece of
a very loyal market.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we go to Chicago again,'' he said with humility, ``we won't
expect to sell three trailer loads a month again.''

 UNDATED: month again.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There have been a handful of closings in New York as well. In
upstate New York, where the trend was slow to dig in, there are
about a dozen working microbreweries, including Brewery Ommegang in
Cooperstown, which opened in 1998, and Flying Bison in Buffalo,
which began brewing last year. All have set their sights on the
local market, which gives them good odds of succeeding, said Bill
Metzger, a trade publisher in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Many brewers call New York City a hard market to break into. But
the Brooklyn Brewery built a loyal following by handling its own
distribution. Sales have grown consistently since it began in 1988,
said Stephen Hindy, president and co-founder. Last year, Brooklyn
Brewery sold 32,000 barrels, 80 percent of them in the metropolitan
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a slow way to grow, but owning our own trucks and doing
our own deliveries has taught us a lot about the beer business,''
Hindy said. ``We know a lot about what our customers are saying.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Sunset Grill &AMP; Tap in Boston, which offers about 60
American craft brews from its 112 taps, beer enthusiasts still
sample the occasional seasonal Summer Wheat Ale or Octoberfest
brew. But instead of jumping on the new brand of the month,
drinkers generally stick with established products from Sam Adams
(made by Boston Beer and the biggest and best-advertised craft beer
in the country), Sierra Nevada (a best-seller from California), and
New England makers like Vermont's Magic Hat and the Tremont
Brewery, a tiny Boston producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it, at this point, is just credibility,'' said Marc
Kadish, the bar's owner. ``Breweries change and the owners change.
Or it's simply not fresh. Somebody takes a chance, tries an
interesting microbrew and is disappointed. Why do people go to
McDonald's? It's consistent and people know what they're going to
get.''
</P>
<P>
   Even very good beer makers ran into problems. Some, expecting
the euphoria of the beer craze to continue, poured borrowed money
into beer-making, and were caught with a lot of shiny equipment to
make too much beer for too few drinkers. Catamount, Vermont's first
microbrewery, completed a $5 million dollar plant just as growth
began to top out. It closed last month.
</P>
<P>
   The Frederick Brewing company of Maryland found itself in a
similar predicament in 1997. It built an $8 million beer-making
plant with a 100,000 barrel annual capacity, but wound up producing
only about 32,000 barrels there. Last year, Frederick was purchased
by Snyder International Brewing Group of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Irene Firmat, a founder of Oregon-based Full Sail, has seen
several brewers in her region merge or consolidate. Others continue
to struggle with whether to go public, stay private or form a
partnership with an industry giant. Her own company faced the same
question when two of her partners recently wanted out of the
business. Full Sail employees bought them out in 1999, and the
brewery is now worker-owned.
</P>
<P>
   Firmat credits Full Sail's survival, in part, to the Pacific
Northwest's taste for better beer. ``Craft beer is part of the
consciousness of the region,'' she said, pointing out that special
brews account for about 10 percent of beer sales in her area, as
opposed to about 3 percent nationally. ``That helps a lot to buffer
the changes in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   One change was increased competition from imported beers. If a
customer was willing to spend a little more for a six pack, it
turned out he was more likely to buy a brand that had been around
for 50 years than 50 days. East Coast brewers in particular felt
the competition of brands like Heineken, Corona and Bass, which
helped push consumption of imports to 9.2 percent of the American
market last year.
</P>
<P>
   The craft beer promoters have themselves to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, tastes have definitely developed,'' said Kadish,
the bar owner. ``People were so scared of the imports and the dark
beers, and now IPA is a household word.'' As with India Pale Ales,
customers barely sputter when they order a Bitburger, Warstiener or
Hackerphscorr.
</P>
<P>
   To further erode consumer confidence, the megabrewers played an
awkward role in the specialty beer field. The large beer makers
answered the call for unique beers with their own homespun-sounding
labels, including Anheuser-Busch's Red Wolf, Coors' Killian's Red
and Miller's Red Dog. As if that scarlet trio were not confusing
enough, consumers were unsure whether they were drinking a hometown
favorite, or a quaintly packaged version of a megabrew.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some smaller companies, eager for expansion money,
became megabrewer protectorates. Miller, the Milwaukee-based giant,
bought a 50 percent stake in fast-growing Shipyard in 1995. In
exchange, Shipyard gained access to Miller's laboratories, and
probably most important, its distribution system. But Miller
apparently lost interest when Shipyard's barrel production dropped
from 39,500 in 1996 to 25,300 in 1998. Last month, Shipyard
announced it was taking on some debt to buy those shares back.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent doldrums, industry analysts are optimistic.
Beer sales increased by 1.6 percent last year, primarily because
the prime beer drinking population, considered to be people (mostly
men) in their 20s and early 30s, is also up. Beer prices, which
have lagged behind inflation for some 15 years, have climbed.
</P>
<P>
   There are still over 420 small brewers in the United States _ up
from about 200 in 1994 _ and their stories are as varied as their
labels. Together, sales at the four of the largest specialty
brewers _ Boston Beer, Pete's Wicked, Redhook and Pyramid _ fell 24
percent between 1996 and 1999. Yet half of the top 50 craft brewers
had double digit sales growth last year.
</P>
<P>
   Some have been blissfully unaffected by the turmoil. New Belgium
sales were up more than 40 percent last year. Sierra Nevada, the
second largest craft brewer in the United States, has grown right
along since its founding in 1981, increasing its sales nearly 15
percent last year and 26 percent the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle, the beer association chairman, said resisting the
temptation to go for maximum growth helped his Harpoon Brewery keep
its footing as others around him slipped. ``We were not leveraged,
we're not highly leveraged now,'' he said. ``Our focus was making
sure that we were very profitable at the size we were, to store up
resources for the time when the industry thawed again.''
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, most of the specialty brands have reported an
upturn in sales, said Frank Walters, the director of research for
the trade newsletter Impact. ``A lot of the streamlining, getting
rid of the dead-wood brands, we think was probably completed in the
last half of 1999,'' he said. ``Things are starting to grow
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Shakeouts have their advantages. At the National Craft Brewers
Conference in Milwaukee last month attendees were mostly
experienced brewers more interested in seminars like ``Hopping to
Perfection'' and ``The Biodiversity of Yeast'' than newcomers
looking to hop on a bandwagon. ``These events used to be full of
tire kickers,'' said Gary Fish, president of the Deschutes Brewery.
``There's not so many of those people any more.''

PHYSICIANS NOW FACE A WEALTH OF CLINICAL INFORMATION ONLINE
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif., Mo., Mass., Utah)  By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After her 9-year-old daughter developed severe acne and an older
daughter also had intractable skin problems, Seema Cicerone began
to wonder whether her kids had inherited their conditions. She told
Dr. Larry Basso, her longtime physician and an internist at the
Palo Alto Medical Foundation, and he dialed up a Web site for
physicians created at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   Basso quickly found information on the girls' disease _
congenital adrenal hyperplasia, a hormonal imbalance _ and printed
out 20 pages of descriptions, recent research and treatment
descriptions for Cicerone and her husband. They consulted pediatric
specialists and eventually found a low-dose drug regimen that
solved the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was absolutely wonderful to have all the stuff there at
your fingertips,'' Cicerone said. ``We could go to see the
endocrinologist from a point of knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web site, which Stanford first made available to outside
doctors earlier this month, is the latest entry in a race to
transform visits to the doctor by providing a wealth of online
clinical information for physicians. Several other top medical
schools are preparing sites of their own, and there are several
commercially operated sites in operation as well.
</P>
<P>
   These Web sites reinforce a doctor's knowledge, suggest
diagnoses, and provide on-the-spot answers to patients' questions
about their symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the new Web sites may dramatically improve medical
care for patients who live far from leading medical centers. A
doctor in rural Idaho using one of the new Web sites can learn
about the latest treatments for any disease just as quickly as a
doctor on staff at Stanford or Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, the new Web sites and all the other medical
information becoming available online have the potential to alter
the relationship between patient and doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tremendous amount of information about my patients
in the computer,'' said Dr. Thomas H. Lee, an internist and
cardiologist who is medical director for 1,000 doctors at the
Partners Community Health Care network in Boston. ``It's almost
inevitable that as they ask me questions, my eyes glance over to
the screen and I press a couple of keystrokes to get more insight
into the answer. Sometimes my eyes don't glance back so quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee added: ``I do think that something can be lost both in terms
of learning what's going on with the patient and in communicating
to patients.''
</P>
<P>
   But help from the computer to prescribe the right dosage of the
right medication is also of ``huge value,'' he said. ``The best
doctors are going to figure out how to do both.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy Whitley, a second-grade teacher in Springfield, Mo., asked
her doctor last winter about Relenza, an inhaler for flu symptoms
advertised on television. ``He had never prescribed it before,''
she said. ``He sat right there at the computer and worked it up on
this internet line,'' MDConsult. She got a prescription and a
printout that she said ``was very helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts on Internet health care developments say the ultimate
goal, which is probably at least several years away, is to meld
online patient records with information from textbooks and journals
and guidelines suggesting treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The long-term big bang in health care will come when the data
about the patient and the knowledge are completely interwoven,''
said Dr. Bill Detmer, who was a pioneer in making Medline, a huge
government database, available on the Internet in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors can subscribe to e-Skolar, the Stanford service, for
$240 a year, the cost of one or two print subscriptions to medical
journals. E-Skolar is exploring the sale of sponsorships to drug
companies, which may give subscriptions to the doctors that the
manufacturers are already courting. Drug makers spent $11.5 billion
last year on marketing to doctors, estimates McKinsey &AMP; Co., a
consulting firm. Two services operated by medical publishers,
MDConsult and Ovid, also charge fees.
</P>
<P>
   Among the commercially operated sites, Medicalogic/Medscape,
which is supported by advertising, is free. HealtheonWebMD has
lined up sponsors, including DuPont and Microsoft, to pay for
subcriptions for physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, these sites sometimes emphasize information
on conditions that can be treated with the sponsors' drugs. Glaxo
Wellcome, for example, sponsors a portion of the WebMD site devoted
to irritable bowel syndrome, which raises awareness of a problem
that may be treated with a Glaxo Wellcome drug.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, primary care doctors say they appreciate the
ability to get information online faster than they can by calling a
colleague or opening a textbook that may be outdated. The latest
medical Web sites, like Stanford's, are designed to find answers
rapidly for doctors who may have little computer expertise.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, I might spend a couple of hours trying to find
answers,'' Basso said. ``Now, in two minutes I could have the
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Newman, a specialist in pulmonary problems, said, ``When you
encounter a really weird illness, you can just flame the stuff up
on your net.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ted Shortliffe, who recently left Stanford to become
chairman of the Department of Medical Informatics at Columbia
University, said, ``A good caring physician will often tell a
patient, `I have to look this up, talk to someone','' and respond
in a subsequent appointment or refer the patient to another
physician.
</P>
<P>
   But if the answer is available when the question is asked, he
said, ``health care pays for one less visit, maybe unnecessary
referrals to specialists don't have to occur, and the physician is
more efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, managed care companies, which, on average, allot
doctors in their networks eight and a half minutes for each patient
visit, welcome any service that can help doctors shorten office
visits even more to make time for other patients.
</P>
<P>
   The companies are also interested in innovations that promote
``evidence-based medicine'' _ procedures validated by rigorous
clinical trials or by results from long usage _ as a route to cost
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good medicine is less expensive,'' said James Hudak, an
information technology executive at UnitedHealth Group, a managed
care company. ``We will support both consumers and physicians
getting access to evidence-based medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Several big managed care companies, including United Healthcare
and Humana, are planning to join the race to provide online medical
information for doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Big medical groups and many managed care companies, including
United, already try to persuade doctors to pay attention to costs
by telling them how their choices of drugs and diagnostic tests and
referrals to specialists compare with regional averages and other
doctors in the same health plan. If these companies get involved
with the new Web sites, they would have another avenue to
communicate with physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford's Web site can answer a question raised by a patient 87
percent of the time, according to Dr. Kenneth Melmon, chief medical
officer of e-Skolar. He said speedy response was essential because
doctors are desperate to become more efficient, partly due to
pressures from managed care. Doctors demand responses from these
online services within seconds, or they walk away, according to a
survey conducted by McKinsey &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors are looking to increase their efficiency and the
quality of care,'' said Steven P. Halper, a health care analyst at
Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. ``It is a huge and underserved market.
Over time, we think it will evolve into several leading
companies,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, on Friday, Harcourt General, the training and publishing
company, said that it would become sole owner of MDConsult by
acquiring the rest of the online service from Wolters Kluwer, a
Dutch company that also owns Ovid and such medical publishers as
Lippincott Williams &AMP; Wilkins.
</P>
<P>
   Technology officials at a number of medical centers have reacted
positively to the Stanford announcement. Johns Hopkins said it will
soon introduce its own information Web sites for physicians. And
Harvard's teaching hospitals are testing e-Skolar, which includes
access to DXplain, an aid to diagnosing a disease that was
developed at Massachusetts General Hospital, alongside the
hospitals' system of electronic patient records.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very excited'' about the possibilities, said Dr. Robert
C. Goldszer, chairman of the computer advisory group at Brigham &AMP;
Women's Hospital in Boston, which has put information about drug
orders and lab results on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really good idea, a real plus,'' said Dr. Brent C.
James, a vice president of Intermountain Health Care, a
technologically advanced medical system in Salt Lake City. ``The
technical problem would be to integrate it with what we already
have.''
</P>
<P>
   The success of the online medical information services will
hinge on how often doctors use them, said Jon Duane, the chief West
Coast health-care consultant for McKinsey. To keep doctors clicking
in, Medscape e-mails weekly newsletters telling specialists about
the latest developments in their fields.
</P>
<P>
   MDConsult even provides a synopsis of the latest episode of the
popular television show ``ER,'' to prepare physicians for questions
from viewers among their patients.

 ENVIRONMENTALISTS FEAR DEVASTATION IN VAST SIBERIAN LAKE   By c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAIKALSK, Russia _ Near the outlet where the Baikalsk Pulp and
Paper Mill discharges chlorine into the world's largest body of
fresh water, Oleg Dolgov has dropped a line to fish.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists accuse the mill of polluting Siberia's Lake
Baikal, a mile-deep cleft that contains one-fifth of the planet's
fresh water. But Dolgov, who has already snagged a dozen small
fish, shrugs off the danger of contamination. A cargo handler at
the company store, he regularly eats what he catches, and has never
noticed ill effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unemployed come down here all the time in the summer and
catch fish with nets,'' Dolgov said.
</P>
<P>
   Locals may be insouciant, but among environmentalists in Russia
and abroad, the Baikalsk Pulp and Paper Mill symbolizes the abuse
of an ecological treasure. An international campaign is seeking to
close the plant, and Greenpeace has begun nationwide television
advertisements blasting the factory. But even as critics say the
mill threatens this gem of a lake, the management says the demands
for a complete shutdown are blocking efforts to clean the plant up.
</P>
<P>
   The issue goes beyond the lake. Throughout the former Soviet
Union, industry has turned the waterways into environmental
catastrophes.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Vladivostok pumps raw sewage into its bay, the Aral
Sea has been gradually emptied and polluted by agricultural runoff,
and the navy dumped radioactive waste into the White Sea and the
Sea of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists have long had trouble making their case in a
nation predisposed to heavy industry. This time around, the
Baikalsk mill is attempting to blame environmentalists themselves
for the pollution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, Greenpeace and all the environmental
organizations prevent us from improving the environmental situation
of the lake,'' said Anatoly Steinberg, president of the mill.
</P>
<P>
   Baikal is 5,370 feet deep and contains 5,500 cubic miles of
water. Believed to be 25 million years old, the lake floor's
sediment is 5 miles deep, recording eons of life. Buried in its mud
are traces of magnolia pollen, deposited when this northern lake
had a subtropical climate.
</P>
<P>
   Today Baikal is filled with rare species such as freshwater
sponges and seals. Sixty percent of the lake's life forms are
unique, biologists say.
</P>
<P>
   The lake's pure water and the virgin forests around it helped
draw the Baikalsk mill here in the 1960s, a decision that critics
say is a relic of the Soviet Union's central planning. .
</P>
<P>
   ``They put a factory here because there is a lot of forest
here,'' said Vladimir Fialkov, director of the Russian Academy of
Sciences Lake Baikal Museum. ``Then they passed a decree
prohibiting cutting the woods around Baikal, to protect it.'' Then,
he said, timber had to be shipped in from some 600 miles away, in
Chita.
</P>
<P>
   Baikalsk itself is a typical Siberian village _ rows of block
apartments and neighborhoods of log houses with heaps of coal or
wood in back. There is a monument to World War II veterans and a
Soviet-era sculpture of youths reaching for the heavens, as if
grasping for a socialist future. The air is permeated with the
rotten-egg smell of pulp making.
</P>
<P>
   The plant annually produces 160,000 metric tons of high-quality
pulp for domestic and foreign markets. Some of the chlorine,
despite filtration, is discharged into the lake. But Jennie Sutton,
an Englishwoman who lives in the nearby town of Irkutsk and is a
leader of a local group called Baikal Environmental Wave, says the
chlorine is converted to deadly dioxins in the bodies of seals and
other animals. Although the pollution is in only a tiny part of the
lake, the impact is disproportionate, she said. Animals flock to
the warm outflow from the mill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The actual management of the mill is irresponsible
economically,'' Sutton said. ``They have found ways of hiding their
profits to avoid paying for the damage they are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   After years of answering reporters' questions and watching
environmentalists hang banners from his mill's smokestacks,
Steinberg has little patience for the topic of pollution (``Why are
foreigners so primitive?'' he pondered aloud in an interview. ``Why
do they ask such stupid questions?'').
</P>
<P>
   He insists that the mill causes only a minute amount of harm
that the vast lake is capable of handling. ``This is the best
quality of water coming from any paper mill in the world,''
Steinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Many scientists agree that the damage to Baikal has been minimal
and the pollution is restricted to a small portion of the south
part of the lake.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Steinberg says he has plans for reducing pollution
to zero.
</P>
<P>
   Another lakeside mill in the town of Selenginsk, about 120 miles
away, produces an inferior grade of paper in a plant that recycles
waste water, so that, theoretically, at least, it discharges
nothing into the lake. The shareholders of the Baikalsk mill have
decided they will follow suit. They plan to convert the mill to
producing a cheaper grade of pulp that does not require bleaching
and will use a closed filtration system. (Steinberg refuses to
state the cost of remodeling or say where the money will come
from.)
</P>
<P>
   But Steinberg is bitter that, rather than embracing this plan,
environmentalists are, in his view, blocking any solution short of
complete closure. ``Some critics,'' he said, ``have built entire
careers around closing his plant. They are being parasites on the
problem,'' Steinberg said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But some environmentalists believe that the plant's management
simply can't be trusted. And, they say that even mills with
supposedly closed systems often discharge pollutants into the
surrounding watershed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people responsible for checking independently are highly
corruptible,'' Sutton said.
</P>
<P>
   Grigory Galazy, an environmentalist, retired biologist and
former deputy in the regional parliament, says the mill is not
needed. Downstream on the Angara River, which flows from Baikal,
two other pulp and paper mills could pick up the slack, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``While these two factories work at only 30-40 percent of their
capacity, this Baikalsk mill keeps stubbornly contaminating the
lake,'' Galazy said.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists are divided on how serious the damage is. ``In
1989, there were massive deaths in the population of freshwater
seals,'' said Nadezhda Basharova, a hydrobiology professor at the
nearby Irkutsk State University. Autopsies showed that the seals
were abnormally infested with parasites.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists believe the seals were weakened by toxins from
the mill and less able to resist the parasites, Basharova said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, she does not believe the mill should close. ``If
you close it and go away, it will be worse for Baikal, because
there is a lot of contamination in the soil, and it will find its
way into the lake,'' Basharova said,
</P>
<P>
   Environmental warnings carry little weight with many of Baikalsk
Pulp &AMP; Paper Mills workers. Closing the mill would be devastating
for a 3,500-person workforce.
</P>
<P>
   Baikal Environmental Wave is establishing a small business
incubator to encourage alternative employment.The region could
conceivably attract foreign hikers, boaters and hunters. But a
program with a budget of a few thousand dollars would not have the
resources to help a town full of people thrown out of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The factory was built at the same time as the town,'' said
Dolgov, the fisherman. ``If there was no factory, there would be no
jobs. It would be worse than any village could take. The town would
die.''
</P>
<P>
   But others see dangers of another kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger is that we could lose the uniqueness of Baikal,''
Galazy said. ``The loss will be irreparable. There is no other lake
like this in the world.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH ADAMS, Mass. _ Of all the dying mill towns in New England,
this was perhaps the deadest.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid 1980s, 70 percent of its storefronts were empty. The
Sprague Electric Co., the city's largest employer and long its
dominant, paternal presence, shut down in 1985, throwing 4,137
people out of work, affecting virtually every family in the town of
18,000. The unemployment rate, the highest in the state, ran from
25 to 30 percent. The local newspaper kept a front-page box score
on plant closings. A developer suggested that the whole town, lying
at the foot of steep mountains, be flooded to provide lakefront
property.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had hit rock bottom,'' recalled John Barrett 3rd, the
city's mayor for the last 17 years. ``We were the butt of jokes.
The Adams Print Works closed, another 2,200 jobs. The hotel went
bankrupt, it was the third time. Everything was bankrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   But now North Adams is in renaissance, a nascent Soho in the
Berkshires, mainly thanks to a massive new arts complex, the
Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, known as Mass MOCA.
</P>
<P>
   More than two-thirds of the town's shops are occupied, including
a downtown-slick restaurant, 55 Main, with spotlights and arty
furnishings. Artists have moved into some of the long brick mills,
and one houses a shitake mushroom farm. This month, plans were
announced for a $5 million project to turn a deteriorating stretch
of Victorian houses into a bed-and breakfast to be run by the Red
Lion Inn of Stockbridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's wonderful to have an excuse to be doing something
in North Adams. I think it's a great place,'' said Nancy
Fitzpatrick, president of the Red Lion, a favorite with the crowd
that frequents Tanglewood, the nearby summer home of the Boston
Symphony Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   The unlikely catalyst of this change, a gigantic museum in an
abandoned factory featuring trees growing upside down and
sculptures made out of tons of industrial debris, was nearly hooted
out of existence as a $35 million boondoggle before it could be
born.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to understand, everybody laughed at this,'' said
Barrett, who remembers and bristles at every slight his city has
ever suffered from out-of-town writers. Like ``gritty.''
</P>
<P>
   In the year since it opened last Memorial Day weekend, Mass MOCA
has been hailed as a wild success, drawing more than 105,000
visitors to its galleries, 25,000 more to performing arts events,
garnering architectural and preservation awards, and, in an
arrangement that is key to its financial security, renting
commercial space to eight tenants thus far, with 60,000 square feet
scheduled to be occupied by October.
</P>
<P>
   For Mass MOCA, it was a hard, fourteen-year struggle into being,
a cliffhanger of state funding cut-offs, small-scale fund raising,
deadlines missed and extended, plans juggled and changed.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the credit goes to an odd couple: the blue-collar mayor,
and Joseph C. Thompson, a soft-spoken art historian from Williams
College via Oklahoma, who has devoted most of his working life to
the project. Refusing to give up their dream, Thompson and his
development director, Jennifer Trainer, went for months without
pay, turned down lucrative job offers and, along the way, fell in
love, married and now have an infant son. And an infant museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Joe, this wouldn't have happened,'' said Michael
Conforte, director of the Clark Art Institute in neighboring
Williamstown.
</P>
<P>
   Mass MOCA also owes much to three post-modern phenomena.
</P>
<P>
   The first is the tendency of artists to construct works that,
although they are called minimalist, are huge, so huge that art
experts say 90 percent of them cannot be exhibited. Some are so big
and so minimalist they do not even exist; they are just
instructions as to how to build them in the unlikely event there
should be room.
</P>
<P>
   The second phenomenon, as manufacturing is abandoned, is the
existence of big empty industrial spaces. New York's Soho
neighborhood was a manufacturing center, after all, before artists
(and later investment bankers) inhabited its lofts.
</P>
<P>
   The third, which was not foreseen, is the growth of e-commerce
and dot-com companies so fast that this region is being called the
``Silicon Village.'' Web companies are among the museum's main
tenants, including, e.Ziba.com, which markets exotic crafts over
the Internet.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The museum owes much, too, to Williams College, five miles to
the east. Williams gave crucial initial backing to the museum. Some
of its wealthy and well-connected alumni, who bear a fond
allegiance to the surrounding purple hills, invested in the
project. And since the '60s the college's art history department
has spawned a network of museum directors and curators, including
the current director of the Guggenheim, Thomas Krens, who conceived
Mass MOCA after running a more traditional expansion of the
college's art museum.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, when Krens came looking for more display place, Mayor
Barrett showed him the abandoned Sprague plant. It is huge, a third
of the town itself, with 27 buildings scattered around 13 acres,
and it bears a certain resemblance to a walled medieval city,
albeit in rough industrial brick, with a clock tower, courtyards,
passageways and a branch of the Hoosic River flowing through the
middle. The plant was built in 1874 for a then-thriving textile
industry; when that went under in 1942, it was bought by Sprague.
In its heyday, making components for the Gemini moon mission, the
trigger for the atomic bomb, and electronic capacitors, the plant
had its own radio station, orchestra and sports teams.
</P>
<P>
   Entranced, Krens spun out a vision for a museum, involving a
luxury hotel, the architect Frank Gehry and the collection of an
Italian industrialist, Count Giuseppe Panza di Biumo, said to have
a villa stuffed with modern masterpieces. Michael Dukakis, then the
governor, bought into the scheme as a desperate economic
development plan for this forlorn corner, which had been bypassed
by the Massachusetts Miracle boom. Krens estimated that the museum
could be opened by 1990.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1988, Krens left for the Guggenheim, Gehry and the
Italian count along with him. Thompson, his protege, inherited the
project, but by the next year the Massachusetts Miracle went bust.
Dukakis was out by 1990, and the Republican administration of the
new governor, William Weld, swiftly cut off the $688,000 in
development money that Dukakis had slipped in the budget at the
last minute.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Globe sneered at the plan as ``endive economics'' and
the reviews in other newspapers were equally dismissive, calling it
a pipe dream and a hare-brained scheme. But the sometimes puckish
Governor Weld visited the old factory and, like others, fell under
the spell of its space, saying later that he liked its karma. After
a few Scotches and contemplation of a work by Mario Merz that
resembles a spiral of mismatched tables set up for a hotel buffet,
he gave the go-ahead for a gradual release of state funds. But
there were more crises in store, and at one point even the mayor
said ``I'm all MOCA'd out.''
</P>
<P>
   The project was finally saved when the Jacob's Pillow dance
center came in as a sponsor, as required by legislation. This also
changed the plan significantly, adding dance, movies and concerts
by Patti Smith and others to the mix.
</P>
<P>
   `'We'll get some arts into it, some theater. It's so simple,'''
Barrett said. ``But it was all by accident,'' he added. ``Looking
back at it now, it's just downright ridiculous, absurd.''

LAWYERS DEBATE FEASIBILITY OF SUING SUV MAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ While Ford Motor Co. recently acknowledged that sport
utility vehicles can be hazardous to other motorists, law
professors and plaintiff lawyers say that it remains difficult to
win lawsuits based on the damage that sport utilities inflict in
crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Trial lawyers and automakers say that they are aware of only one
lawsuit so far in which a car occupant has sued the manufacturer of
the sport utility that hit her. That case, against Land Rover, was
summarily dismissed in January by a Superior Court judge in Los
Angeles who concluded that the automaker had no legal duty to
consider what would happen to other vehicles and motorists struck
by its products.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some plaintiff lawyers say that even before Ford's recent
pronouncements, they were searching for cases in which tall sport
utilities overrode cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just waiting for the right case to come along, where
someone isn't sodden with alcohol or going 100 miles an hour,''
said Robert Palmer, a lawyer in Springfield, Mo., who is the vice
president of the Attorneys Information Exchange Group, a national
group of trial lawyers who sue automakers.
</P>
<P>
   Legal scholars say that while Ford and other sport utility
makers have a strong legal case, liability law can evolve quickly
in response to shifts in public sentiment, as shown by recent
litigation against tobacco companies and gun makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were the Ford Motor Co., I wouldn't treat this very
cavalierly, but at this point in the development of tort law, they
have the better argument,'' said Roger C. Henderson, a law
professor at the University of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Most legal experts agree that Ford Motor's recent acknowledgment
of the dangers posed to occupants of other vehicles by sport
utility vehicles is unlikely to help trial lawyers. The legal issue
is not whether sport utilities are particularly deadly to other
motorists, but whether that deadliness results in legal liability
for automakers.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturers have lost many lawsuits over the years
accusing them of having designed automobiles that inadequately
protect occupants during crashes. Some of these suits have involved
occupants injured or killed when sport utilities rolled over. But
successful suits holding automakers liable for the harm that their
products cause to other vehicles and their occupants are another
matter.
</P>
<P>
   In a corporate ``citizenship report'' distributed at its annual
shareholders meeting in Atlanta on May 11, Ford attributed the
heavy damage inflicted during crashes by sport utilities and other
so-called light trucks to the big vehicles' design, not just their
weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trucks are also built with a more rigid frame and higher
stance _ important for towing and hauling cargo _ but this means
that the stiff parts of the truck may not engage all the parts of a
car designed to absorb impact,'' the company said, vowing to
continue its industry-leading efforts to find solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Petrauskas, Ford's vice president for safety and the
environment, said that sport utility manufacturers and their
customers were not exposed to litigation because the vehicles were
not defective or negligently designed. She depicted the report as
containing a scientific discussion of sport utility safety rather
than an admission of defects or negligence in design.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers have several strong defenses against litigation
involving damage and injuries caused by sport utilities during
crashes. Legal tradition holds that makers of large cars, pickups
and trailer trucks are not liable just because these vehicles
inflict severe damage on small cars during crashes. Trucks and
large cars need to be big to haul freight and plenty of people.
</P>
<P>
   And most state courts allow some balancing of a product's
usefulness with its risk to society, along with the cost of design
changes to reduce those risks.
</P>
<P>
   But a few legal experts suggest that sport utilities may not
pass muster on this balancing of risk and usefulness. Richard
Friedman, a law professor at the University of Michigan, questioned
whether their off-road capability _ for which they have high ground
clearance and high bumpers _ justified the extra damage and
injuries caused when the tall vehicles override cars' bumpers and
door sills during crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Such arguments are quite theoretical. In an actual crash, it is
extremely difficult for engineers, much less juries, to distinguish
between the damage caused by sport utilities' height and the damage
caused by their considerable weight.
</P>
<P>
   Large, heavy cars have always done a lot of damage to other
vehicles, although they are far less likely than sport utilities to
kill the other motorist in a crash. The line between heavy cars and
sport utilities has been blurred by the introduction of carlike
sport utilities like the Lexus RX300, which is essentially a tall
Toyota Camry wagon with all-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the evidence on the deadliness of sport utilities is
based on national statistics, rather than specific crashes. Midsize
sport utilities are three times as likely as midsize cars to kill
the other driver in a crash.
</P>
<P>
   This is true even though occupants of midsize sport utilities
are also more likely to die in a crash themselves than occupants of
midsize cars. That is because the sport utilities are more prone to
rolling over and have limited crumple zones.
</P>
<P>
   Using such statistics tends to be easier in a class-action
lawsuit than in a specific personal-injury claim, but it is unclear
whether people hit by sport utilities represent what courts would
accept as a legal class.
</P>
<P>
   The usual basis for establishment of such a class is a
contractual relationship between a manufacturer and the people who
are harmed, such as when people buy a defective product. No such
relationship exists between automakers and people who have been hit
by sport utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Only recently have some courts allowed class-action lawsuits by
people without such contractual relationships, notably by gunshot
victims against gun makers and by people who sue tobacco companies
because they were exposed to colleagues' secondhand smoke. But such
class-action cases remain uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't any clear duty by Ford to other motorists. They
owe a duty to their customers,'' said John C. Coffee, a law
professor at Columbia University.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There are also no federal regulations requiring automakers to
limit the damage that their products may inflict on other
motorists. Sport utilities are specifically exempt from federal
regulations on bumper height, so as to preserve their off-road
driving capability.
</P>
<P>
   Land Rover emphasized the absence of bumper-height regulations
in persuading Judge Jan A. Pluim of the Los Angeles Superior Court
earlier this year to dismiss the lawsuit filed against it by Diane
Y. Diaz de Veer, who suffered brain injuries when her Saab was hit
by a Range Rover. Arnold Schwartz, the woman's lawyer, said he
would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawyers believe that Ford, by forthrightly addressing sport
utilities' problems now and describing its search for solutions,
may have actually reduced its potential exposure to large verdicts
for punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ford may have transferred some of its liability to
owners of sport utilities. ``It was a very wise statement for them
to make, because they're putting the world on notice that if you're
in a sport utility and drive it negligently, then you could be
responsible,'' said Ralph Knowles, a plaintiff lawyer in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, a particularly gruesome aspect of accidents
involving sport utility vehicles also discourages plaintiff lawyers
from filing lawsuits over their designs.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics show that the high front ends of sport utilities make
them more likely to hit other motorists in the head, neck and upper
torso and kill them, rather than crippling them with injuries to
the waist or legs. Large liability awards tend to go to people who
are severely injured but survive to provide vivid testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer said he had just turned down a sport utility case mainly
because the car driver had died in the crash. Preparing a lawsuit
that breaks new legal ground costs $200,000 to $400,000, he said,
adding, ``A wrongful-death case in most parts of the country is
just not worth a lot of money.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ever since designers and fashion editors started
tossing about the term ``ladylike dressing'' like a threadbare
muffler from Gimbel's, one has had the feeling they don't know what
they are talking about. Oh, sure, they have contacts in the world
of thin women _ what is Vogue if not an illustrated Social
Register? And there's no telling how many designers have set their
speed dials to BUtterfield-8.
</P>
<P>
   But just because the fall collections are loaded with examples
of upper-echelon chic doesn't mean they jibe with the reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is any such thing as ladylike dressing,
said Nan Kempner, the Park Avenue hostess and champion
clotheshorse. ``I think you're the lady and the clothes are just a
reflection of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Kempner, who will be 70 in July, is unique, with her
40 years of wearing Saint Laurent couture. ``I mean,'' her friend
Bill Blass said, ``have you ever had the statistics on what Nan has
purchased or seen?'' But as she herself would point out, she isn't
the only socialite with an informed view of the new dressing up.
</P>
<P>
   Here are four women _ Amanda Hearst, Brooke de Ocampo, Kempner
and Brooke Astor, four generations of New York women, age 16 to 98
_ defining what it means to dress like a lady.
</P>
<P>
   Outgrowing Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just at Scoop and I bought a lavender tube top and a
pair of hazel capri pants in linen,'' said Amanda Hearst, the
16-year-old daughter of Anne Hearst and a great-granddaughter of
William Randolph Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst is blond and pretty and very poised. A sophomore at a
boarding school, she follows what's in fashion. ``I buy stuff at
Prada, but mostly it's shoes and coats,'' she said. ``That's what
my friends and I do. I also like stuff from Tocca and Katayone
Adeli. Stuff you see on Barneys eighth floor. We really don't go in
for the top labels.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Hearst said, she has noticed a sea change among her
friends, even as they slave away at school. ``Last year the look
was Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch and Ralph Lauren polo shirts and khaki
pants,'' she said. ``Right now, we're into blow drying our hair,
wearing delicate jewelry and clothes that fit, especially skirts.
We're always into makeup.''
</P>
<P>
   But can a tube top be ladylike?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I think so,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ladylike Without the Rules
</P>
<P>
   ``The girls who come to us are, for lack of a better word, more
earthy,'' said Josh Patner of the dress house Tuleh. ``The Nan
Kempners of the world, in my imagination, float on clouds. Brooke
very much is putting her heel to the pavement.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to Brooke de Ocampo.
</P>
<P>
   With three small children, a busy social life with her husband,
Emilio, and a book in the works with the photographer Jonathan
Becker, de Ocampo, at 33, has a lot on her mind other than clothes.
Yet, every day she gets dressed as if she's going somewhere _ last
Monday, in a white Marc Jacobs peasant top with fuchsia Helmut Lang
trousers and Manolo Blahnik sandals. ``I'm dressed in a way that
helps me get things done,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   de Ocampo is part of a junior crowd of socialites, though none
really like the term. Still, it was obvious to her and her friends
that a number of designers, notably Michael Kors, were thinking of
this younger group when they showed their ladylike fall
collections. ``Some of these designers are pals of mine,'' she said
hesitantly, ``but what they were doing looked like a caricature of
all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``I feel that if you're going to have a cashmere coat
with fur, then show it with jeans and high-heeled boots. It would
look ladylike without looking stamped.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, what de Ocampo and women her age want is a
put-together look that still says girlishly casual, even sexy. She
brought out a couple of things from her closet: a cinnamon-and-pink
polka dot Tuleh skirt she has worn with a hot-pink sweater, and a
purple chiffon Helmut Lang top she wore with pants to a dressy
Sotheby's dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hardly ever wear suits,'' she said. The last time she did
was for a wedding. It was by Chloe, and it fit beautifully, she
said. ``The skirt was practically riding on my hips.''
</P>
<P>
   Dressed to Please
</P>
<P>
   To give some idea how crazy Nan Kempner is for clothes, in 1957,
when she was pregnant with one of her three children, she had her
maternity clothes made at Patou in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you love that?'' she said one afternoon in the Park
Avenue duplex where she and her husband, the investment banker
Thomas Kempner, have lived for 42 years.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the clothes were made by Karl Lagerfeld, then
known at Patou as Karl. Kempner shrugged. ``Everybody's got to
start somewhere,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She had just come from having lunch at Swifty's, which she
treats like a canteen, and she had on a beige sweater with a
20-year-old Saint Laurent python skirt. ``Everything recycles,''
she said. ``So if you keep clothes long enough, you have a good
wardrobe.''
</P>
<P>
   Kempner doesn't wear only couture, but she buys a lot of it, and
at half price, since the samples fit her. ``Couture is like a
second skin _ it moves with you,'' she said. ``And the more you
wear it, the better it feels. You break it in.'' She added, apropos
of both Saint Laurent and herself, ``If you've got a great look,
you don't really improve it. You master it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kempner, who recently bought a cream-colored Saint Laurent
pantsuit and a leopard chiffon blouse (``I'm mad about that
shirt,'' she said), thinks the most important thing about dressing
is to put yourself together _ and then forget about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dress to be appealing _ to anything and everybody,'' Kempner
said. ``That's a wonderful thing about Brooke Astor. She always
dresses appropriately. And when she goes to these big charity
things, sure, she brings out all the jewelry. Why not? Everybody
wants to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   So dressing is a social grace?
</P>
<P>
   ``You got it. You dress to please people.''
</P>
<P>
   And Don't Forget Your Hat
</P>
<P>
   Recently, in one of a series of articles she has written for
Vanity Fair about modern manners, Astor recalled some advice from
her grandmother: A lady should always leave something on her plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``On looking back,'' she wrote, ``I recognize a philosophy
behind this admonition. To want to enjoy one's dinner is correct,
but greed is not.'' Astor, every bit the lady, has given millions
to worthy causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I dress so extraordinarily,'' she said by phone.
</P>
<P>
   Though feeling a bit under the weather, she was on her way to
her home in Maine. ``Some of my suits I've worn for ages, because
they're taken very good care of,'' she said. ``I have a very good
French maid whom I've had for years. She always sees that all my
clothes are in very good condition. I buy a couple of new evening
dresses every year. I buy Balmain from my friend Oscar. I like
those clothes very much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wear a hat _ you see, I was brought up to all that.
Wearing a hat is also good for your eyes. My eyes are marvelous. I
can see right the way across the river. Which at 98, is pretty
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Astor had some plain old wisdom for the new business of dressing
up. ``I think your clothes should be very clean and fresh and
always in good shape,'' she said. ``I think all your things ought
to be in order. Go along that way, and you'll be all right.'' &QL;

SAMPRAS EXITS EARLY IN FRENCH OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ It is hardly a surprise to see Pete Sampras bid farewell
to the French Open long before the last blow has been struck. At
this stage of his otherwise brilliant career, it is only a question
of how he will be eliminated, and who will do the eliminating.
</P>
<P>
   The answers came particularly early this year. They came Monday
on the first day of play, and they came under an ever-changing sky
against a younger and more powerful opponent, Mark Philippoussis,
who has given him trouble in the past on surfaces much more
conducive to Sampras' game.
</P>
<P>
   But this was European clay, the red and gritty stuff that sticks
to Sampras' sneakers and sticks in his craw. And though the
second-seeded American performed and served quite well in stretches
on the refurbished center court, he did not play well enough when
it mattered to avoid another bitter five-set experience in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Philippoussis prevailed, 4-6, 7-5, 7-6 (4), 4-6, 8-6, in a match
that required 3 hours 39 minutes and ended with Sampras losing his
serve at love on a double fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the fifth set it comes down to nerves, and he had the
better nerve,'' said Sampras, who also lost the second set and the
sixth game of the final set on double faults.
</P>
<P>
   Though Sampras has won 12 Grand Slam singles titles _ tying him
for the most ever with Roy Emerson _ he has never advanced past the
semifinals at Roland Garros Stadium. He got that far only in 1996,
negotiating a brutal draw before running out of resources on a very
hot day against the eventual champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov. But with
Sampras approaching his 29th birthday, that memorable run now looks
increasingly like an anomaly. In 1997, he lost to Magnus Norman in
the third round. In 1998, he lost to Ramon Delgado in the second
round, and last year, he was beaten in the second round by Andrei
Medvedev, who went on to reach the final against Sampras'
compatriot, Andre Agassi.
</P>
<P>
   All three of Sampras' recent losses came on the Suzanne Lenglen
court, one that he dislikes and contends is considerably slower
than the other showcourts here. But this time, he was beaten on the
center court he prefers, and beaten at his own game by a big server
who likes to push forward to the net and take risks from the
baseline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I had some chances, but Mark, I give him all the
credit, he served huge,'' Sampras said after watching 23 aces go
by.
</P>
<P>
   Two other Americans fared better Monday. First, Meghann
Shaughnessy upset the No. 12 women's seeded player, Julie
Halard-Decugis of France by 7-5, 6-4. Then Jan-Michael Gambill
ousted eighth-seeded Nicolas Kiefer of Germany, 6-3, 7-5, 6-1,
although it might have been more satisfying if the clearly off-form
Kiefer had not missed most of the last two months because of ankle
surgery. But Jennifer Capriati, still struggling since her split
from her former coach Harold Solomon, fell to Fabiola Zuluaga of
Columbia, 6-3, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   Though Sampras holds a 7-3 career edge over Philippoussis,
Sampras has now lost to him twice in Grand Slam events: the first
time in straight sets at the 1996 Australian Open when
Philippoussis was still a relative unknown. But if Philippoussis,
with his short attention span and penchant for the unforced error,
has not managed to succeed consistently on tour, he has clearly
improved his ability to handle pressure (not to mention short, low
balls). He was the key figure in Australia's Davis Cup victory over
France last year on indoor clay, and if not for a serious knee
injury that forced him to retire with a one-set lead over Sampras
in the Wimbledon quarterfinals last year, he might have eliminated
the American there as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing Mark in the first round is certainly a tough draw,''
Sampras said. ``I certainly haven't got the breaks at this event
over the years, but one year hopefully I'll get those breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In a perfect world, a perfect career, you'd like to win all
the majors, do everything in the game,'' he added. ``I have a very
high bar that I've raised. It kind of would be disappointing if I
would not win it, but, you know, life will go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Martina Hingis would agree and has a great deal more time left
to do so. Traditionally, it is the defending champion who opens
play on center court at Roland Garros, but this year, the defending
champion has retired, which means that Hingis, whom Steffi Graf
beat in last year's final, got the honor of walking on court at 11
a.m. with only a few hundred fans in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   There was not much suspense surrounding the outcome. Hingis had
beaten Sabine Appelmans of Belgium in all five of their previous
matches, and she beat her again, 6-0, 6-4, in less than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   But what was in doubt was how the Parisian fans would react to
Hingis after her histrionics in last year's final, when she
contravened tennis etiquette by crossing the net to question a line
call and later lost her composure and served underhand twice out of
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Though she may yet have some public relations work to do over
the next two weeks, the response to Hingis' arrival Monday was
restrained: light applause and a few scattered whistles. Hingis, as
usual, is choosing to accentuate the positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here since Tuesday, and I never had so many people
recognize me walking on the streets in regular clothes, never.''
she said. ``So it was real nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Capriati, visibly heavier than she was during her resurgence
from last summer to March of this year, has now lost both her
matches without Solomon in her corner, first to Anne-Gaelle Sidot
in the opening round at the Italian Open and to Zuluaga Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harold was great for me and a great coach,'' the 15th-seeded
Capriati said. ``But I took myself back from that point to top 20.
The coach is always just going to be the coach, but the player is
the one that does all the work. I just don't want to make it seem
like he brought me back and now because he's not with me, I'm going
to go down. That's not fair to say.'' &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   From any perspective, the remote, rugged country surrounding the
Bitterroot Mountains in western Montana and central Idaho appears
ideal for grizzly bears. Here are the types of terrain grizzlies
love: alpine meadows; pine, cedar and fir forests; glacial lakes
and fast-running streams flowing into lush river valleys.
</P>
<P>
   Although salmon have declined sharply, the roots, berries, nuts,
elk, deer and insects the giants need to fuel their six-month
hibernation abound. Indeed, hundreds of the big bears that the Nez
Perce tribe called xaxat roamed this area when Lewis and Clark
passed through in 1806, killing seven. In the next decades,
hundreds of grizzlies fell to hunters, with the last recorded kill
in 1932. Despite several exhaustive surveys, no one has seen a
grizzly bear in this region for more than half a century.
</P>
<P>
   That situation is about to change. This summer, the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service is expected to adopt a controversial plan to
put grizzly bears back in the Bitterroot region. A 15-member
citizen management committee will be charged with finding a way for
the bears to flourish and coexist with humans, particularly those
engaged in backcountry recreation, logging, mining and ranching.
</P>
<P>
   If threatened congressional and legal challenges from Idaho do
not delay the plan from being carried out, the management committee
will complete preparations for the arrival of the first bears in
2002, said Dr. Christopher Servheen, grizzly bear recovery
coordinator for the Fish and Wildlife Service, based in Missoula,
Mont. Over five years, at least 25 bears will be released in the
Bitterroots. Because of the grizzly's slow reproductive rate, it
will take 50 to 110 years for the population to reach the project's
goal of 280 bears.
</P>
<P>
   Servheen said the reintroduction was an essential step in
ensuring the long-term survival of the grizzly in the lower 48
states and its removal from the endangered species list, where it
has been designated as ``threatened'' since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Like the wolves released in Yellowstone National Park and these
same Bitterroots in 1995 and 1996, the grizzlies will be relocated
as a ``nonessential experimental population'' under the Endangered
Species Act. That designation makes it easier to remove bears that
come into conflict with people or fail to thrive. It also allows
officials to suspend habitat protections that ordinarily apply to
endangered species, thereby giving them greater flexibility in
dealing with land-use conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know enough about the biology of bears to manage them,''
Servheen said. ``The limiting factor is the behavior of people. We
have to strike a balance between the needs of bears and the needs
of people.'' Finding that balance is the task of the citizen
management committee, appointed by the secretary of the interior,
and made up of local people from Montana and Idaho, the Nez Perce
tribe, the National Forest Service and the Fish and Wildlife
Service.
</P>
<P>
   North America's largest carnivore, the grizzly bear is a figure
of legendary might. A subspecies of the brown bear named for its
silver-tipped guard hairs, which appeared ``grizzly'' to early
explorers, it stands up to 7-feet tall and weighs 300 to 600
pounds, with some reaching 800 pounds. Highly protective of their
food and young, aggressive in response to surprises, and solitary
by habit, the big bears are often considered dangerously
antisocial.
</P>
<P>
   Grizzly bears are relatively abundant in parts of Canada and
Alaska, but in the western United States, where Servheen estimates
that 50,000 roamed at the time of Lewis and Clark's expedition,
they number fewer than 1,000 and occupy only about 2 percent of
their original range. The remaining bears are largely concentrated
in and around Yellowstone National Park, Glacier National Park and
the Bob Marshall Wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife biologists have long recommended establishing another
population of bears in the Bitterroot region to lessen the risk of
extinction and ultimately provide a vital genetic link between the
geographically isolated grizzlies in Yellowstone and those farther
north. The grizzlies are also expected to improve the health of the
Bitterroot ecosystem. The region contains the largest expanse of
contiguous federal lands in the lower 48 states, covering some
26,000 square miles, and includes two vast roadless areas, the
Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness and the
Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness, which are considered ideal for
grizzly bears, whose home territory can reach 500 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   Bears for the reintroduction will be taken from Yellowstone
National Park, Glacier National Park and Canada. The bears are
expected to adjust without much difficulty, unless they run afoul
of humans; 79 percent of grizzlies that die prematurely do so at
the hands of humans, said Dr. David Mattson, a wildlife biologist
with the United States Geological Survey's Biological Resources
Division in Flagstaff, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Many opponents of the reintroduction plan fear grizzly attacks,
a possibility that most bear biologists consider remote, especially
in the first years of the project. Dr. Stephen Herrero, an emeritus
professor of environmental science at the University of Calgary and
a leading expert on bear attacks, said, ``There are 700,000 black
bears and 70,000 grizzly bears in North America and on average they
kill three people a year and injure a dozen to two dozen. People
fear these animals because they can be violent and cause injury or
death, but once people know about bears, they can respect them and
live with them without danger.''
</P>
<P>
   All the reintroduced bears will be equipped with radio collars
so that wildlife biologists can monitor their health and movements,
Servheen said. The citizen management committee and wildlife
officials will also work to allay people's fear of bears and to
prevent the sorts of situations and conflicts that lead to the
deaths of bears or people.

</P>
<P>
   Establishment of the citizen management committee represents a
triumph for a coalition consisting of the Resource Organization on
Timber Supply, a group of timber companies and unions with
headquarters in Lewiston, Idaho; the Intermountain Forest Industry
Association, in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho; the National Wildlife
Federation; and Defenders of Wildlife. In 1995, that coalition
presented the concept to Servheen and the grizzly bear recovery
team as a way to allow logging, recreation and other activities to
continue in the company of bears.
</P>
<P>
   The Fish and Wildlife Service embraced the idea, which was
hailed nationally as a sign that a new spirit of cooperation was
taking hold in the West after years of bitter conflict over land
use and the Endangered Species Act. Despite a poll showing that a
vast majority of people regionally and nationally wanted grizzlies,
the plan was immediately caught in the sort of fierce political
struggle it was intended to prevent.
</P>
<P>
   A number of environmental groups oppose the plan, and have
proposed an alternative plan for the grizzlies. ``This plan is not
the best we could do for bears,'' said Mike Bader, executive
director of the Alliance for the Wild Rockies, which is based in
Missoula, Mont. He said the plan went too far in accommodating the
timber industry and not far enough in protecting grizzly bears and
their habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-bear groups and a majority of the region's political
leaders complain that because the grizzly is not at immediate risk
of extinction, the federal government is needlessly unloosing a
predator that is a threat to humans. They also contend that because
the citizen management committee must report to the secretary of
the interior, who has legal authority for endangered species, the
plan does not cede enough control to state and local officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Idaho congressional delegation has worked for several years
to block the reintroduction, and Gov. Dirk Kempthorne has publicly
threatened to file suit to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Mulligan, president of Three Rivers Timber Inc., of Kamiah,
Idaho, and co-chairman of the Resource Organization on Timber
Supply, said that anger over the Clinton administration's roadless
plan for national forests and proposals to restore the salmon and
steelhead trout runs on the Snake River had stirred anti-government
sentiment. People have directed their anger and alienation over
those issues at the timber industry and the union groups backing
the grizzly reintroduction, making it difficult for them to rally
support. ``We get beat up pretty bad at public hearings on
grizzlies,'' Mulligan said. ``But we made a deal with the best of
intentions and so we have stuck to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Alone among prominent officials in Montana and Idaho, Gov. Marc
Racicot of Montana has supported the reintroduction plan, while
negotiating on questions relating to the powers of the citizen
management committee, financing and the health and source of the
bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``The citizen management committee offers a new opportunity to
engage people who live next door to these truly majestic animals,
to see whether people can take charge and get involved in a
thoughtful and meaningful way in the process of preserving
endangered species,'' Racicot said.

   A Designer Shows her Styles
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Not long ago, Elisa Jimenez, a flower-power-minded
designer whose answering machine asks callers to ``be well, be
blessed,'' sent some dresses encased in hardened clay to a Los
Angeles shop, Naked. To see just what a dress looks like, you'd
have to crack open the packaging at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a hard thing to sell,'' Steven Russell, an
owner of the store, recalls telling Jimenez. He suggested she send
at least one dress in an open case. Jimenez would not. Buying a
dress is all about taking a risk, she told Russell, and hey, some
risks don't work out.
</P>
<P>
   A commercial instinct is not Jimenez's forte, she admitted the
other day, although she is trying to acquire one. The designer, who
is 35 and lives in Hell's Kitchen, sews one-of-a-kind dresses
directly on her customers, typically dousing the garments with oils
for an aromatherapy effect. Last week, she introduced her first
full ready-to-wear line at Kirna Zabete on Greene Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to make some money,'' she said. She has had a following
among stylists and celebrities like Courtney Love, but few women
with more pedestrian lifestyles buy her clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The collection consists of one-size-fits-all polymorphous items,
like halters that transform into skirts. ``There are about 10
different ways to wear everything,'' said Sarah Hales, an owner of
Kirna Zabete, adding that so far Jimenez's clothes were attracting
``experimental'' customers.
</P>
<P>
   But some pieces are too advanced even for the daring. Last week,
Hales returned a sequined orange cape to the designer. ``I told
her: `Take this home with you. It's scaring customers.'''
</P>
<P>
   Where's the `Beauty' in Beauty Pageants?
</P>
<P>
   Beauty pageants are generally not the sort of spectacles that
draw people with an aversion to camp _ people like the the German
photographer Juergen Teller, who is best known for saturnine
fashion images in magazines like Index and W. But last fall,
Teller, a pioneer of the unglamorous documentary style of fashion
photography of the 1990s, found himself captivated by the 1999 Miss
World Competition in London. He was on assignment from the Goethe
Institute of Caracas to take a portrait of Venezuela. Once there,
Teller photographed all 88 contestants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty much blown away by how determined they all
were,'' he said last week. ``They were just standing in front of my
camera, each one, and smiling. They were not necessarily smiling at
me. When a model smiles at me, I feel she means it to a certain
extent.''
</P>
<P>
   The results of the Miss World project will be on view starting
Thursday at the Lehmann Maupin gallery on Greene Street, in
Teller's first commercial exhibition in the United States. The show
will also feature images from his ``Go-Sees'' project, candid
photographs of aspiring models who visited his London studio, taken
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at their portfolios,'' he said, ``and most of them
were much sweeter and more beautiful than they looked in their
books.''
</P>
<P>
   From X-Rays to Image Making
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing aggressively groovy in Patrick Li's look _ no
Yves Saint Laurent suit, no glasses that look like German surgical
instruments, nothing suggesting that he landed a job at Interview
magazine in 1990, the day after he moved to New York, or wound up
as a protege of the graphic designer Fabien Baron. ``I wanted to be
a radiologist,'' Li said in his Mott Street studio recently. ``Look
at X-rays, right? They're amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   With two Paris-based partners, Ezra Petronio and Suzanne Koller,
who edit the avant-garde French fashion magazine Self Service, Li,
31, has become a sought-after image maker in the fashion world. He
and his partners have designed ads for Jean Paul Gaultier and
packaging for a Commes des Garcons fragrance, Odeur 71. The team
was recently asked to help reshape the image of the French fashion
house Cacharel, which has just hired the British team of Suzanne
Clements and Inacio Ribeiro as head designers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their work is very graphic and clean,'' Annick Gorman,
creative director of Cacharel, said. ``We don't want to be as
romantic as we have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Karl Lagerfeld asked Li to produce Chanel's next
in-store catalog, which Lagerfeld has always designed. ``I was,
like, `Karl Lagerfeld _ oh, no!''' Li said. ``But behind the fan,
there's amazingly little pretense.''

   NORTH ADAMS, Mass. _ Of all the dying mill towns in New England,
this was perhaps the deadest.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid 1980s, 70 percent of its storefronts were empty. The
Sprague Electric Co., the city's largest employer and long its
dominant, paternal presence, shut down in 1985, throwing 4,137
people out of work, affecting virtually every family in the town of
18,000. The unemployment rate, the highest in the state, ran from
25 to 30 percent. The local newspaper kept a front-page box score
on plant closings. A developer suggested that the whole town, lying
at the foot of steep mountains, be flooded to provide lakefront
property.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had hit rock bottom,'' recalled John Barrett 3rd, the
city's mayor for the last 17 years. ``We were the butt of jokes.
The Adams Print Works closed, another 2,200 jobs. The hotel went
bankrupt, it was the third time. Everything was bankrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   But now North Adams is in renaissance, a nascent Soho in the
Berkshires, mainly thanks to a massive new arts complex, the
Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, known as Mass MOCA.
</P>
<P>
   More than two-thirds of the town's shops are occupied, including
a downtown-slick restaurant, 55 Main, with spotlights and arty
furnishings. Artists have moved into some of the long brick mills,
and one houses a shitake mushroom farm. This month, plans were
announced for a $5 million project to turn a deteriorating stretch
of Victorian houses into a bed-and breakfast to be run by the Red
Lion Inn of Stockbridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's wonderful to have an excuse to be doing something
in North Adams. I think it's a great place,'' said Nancy
Fitzpatrick, president of the Red Lion, a favorite with the crowd
that frequents Tanglewood, the nearby summer home of the Boston
Symphony Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   The unlikely catalyst of this change, a gigantic museum in an
abandoned factory featuring trees growing upside down and
sculptures made out of tons of industrial debris, was nearly hooted
out of existence as a $35 million boondoggle before it could be
born.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to understand, everybody laughed at this,'' said
Barrett, who remembers and bristles at every slight his city has
ever suffered from out-of-town writers. Like ``gritty.''
</P>
<P>
   In the year since it opened last Memorial Day weekend, Mass MOCA
has been hailed as a wild success, drawing more than 105,000
visitors to its galleries, 25,000 more to performing arts events,
garnering architectural and preservation awards, and, in an
arrangement that is key to its financial security, renting
commercial space to eight tenants thus far, with 60,000 square feet
scheduled to be occupied by October.
</P>
<P>
   For Mass MOCA, it was a hard, fourteen-year struggle into being,
a cliffhanger of state funding cut-offs, small-scale fund raising,
deadlines missed and extended, plans juggled and changed.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the credit goes to an odd couple: the blue-collar mayor,
and Joseph C. Thompson, a soft-spoken art historian from Williams
College via Oklahoma, who has devoted most of his working life to
the project. Refusing to give up their dream, Thompson and his
development director, Jennifer Trainer, went for months without
pay, turned down lucrative job offers and, along the way, fell in
love, married and now have an infant son. And an infant museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Joe, this wouldn't have happened,'' said Michael
Conforte, director of the Clark Art Institute in neighboring
Williamstown.
</P>
<P>
   Mass MOCA also owes much to three post-modern phenomena.
</P>
<P>
   The first is the tendency of artists to construct works that,
although they are called minimalist, are huge, so huge that art
experts say 90 percent of them cannot be exhibited. Some are so big
and so minimalist they do not even exist; they are just
instructions as to how to build them in the unlikely event there
should be room.
</P>
<P>
   The second phenomenon, as manufacturing is abandoned, is the
existence of big empty industrial spaces. New York's Soho
neighborhood was a manufacturing center, after all, before artists
(and later investment bankers) inhabited its lofts.
</P>
<P>
   The third, which was not foreseen, is the growth of e-commerce
and dot-com companies so fast that this region is being called the
``Silicon Village.'' Web companies are among the museum's main
tenants, including, e.Ziba.com, which markets exotic crafts over
the Internet.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The museum owes much, too, to Williams College, five miles to
the east. Williams gave crucial initial backing to the museum. Some
of its wealthy and well-connected alumni, who bear a fond
allegiance to the surrounding purple hills, invested in the
project. And since the '60s the college's art history department
has spawned a network of museum directors and curators, including
the current director of the Guggenheim, Thomas Krens, who conceived
Mass MOCA after running a more traditional expansion of the
college's art museum.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, when Krens came looking for more display place, Mayor
Barrett showed him the abandoned Sprague plant. It is huge, a third
of the town itself, with 27 buildings scattered around 13 acres,
and it bears a certain resemblance to a walled medieval city,
albeit in rough industrial brick, with a clock tower, courtyards,
passageways and a branch of the Hoosic River flowing through the
middle. The plant was built in 1874 for a then-thriving textile
industry; when that went under in 1942, it was bought by Sprague.
In its heyday, making components for the Gemini moon mission, the
trigger for the atomic bomb, and electronic capacitors, the plant
had its own radio station, orchestra and sports teams.
</P>
<P>
   Entranced, Krens spun out a vision for a museum, involving a
luxury hotel, the architect Frank Gehry and the collection of an
Italian industrialist, Count Giuseppe Panza di Biumo, said to have
a villa stuffed with modern masterpieces. Michael Dukakis, then the
governor, bought into the scheme as a desperate economic
development plan for this forlorn corner, which had been bypassed
by the Massachusetts Miracle boom. Krens estimated that the museum
could be opened by 1990.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1988, Krens left for the Guggenheim, Gehry and the
Italian count along with him. Thompson, his protege, inherited the
project, but by the next year the Massachusetts Miracle went bust.
Dukakis was out by 1990, and the Republican administration of the
new governor, William Weld, swiftly cut off the $688,000 in
development money that Dukakis had slipped in the budget at the
last minute.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Globe sneered at the plan as ``endive economics'' and
the reviews in other newspapers were equally dismissive, calling it
a pipe dream and a hare-brained scheme. But the sometimes puckish
Governor Weld visited the old factory and, like others, fell under
the spell of its space, saying later that he liked its karma. After
a few Scotches and contemplation of a work by Mario Merz that
resembles a spiral of mismatched tables set up for a hotel buffet,
he gave the go-ahead for a gradual release of state funds. But
there were more crises in store, and at one point even the mayor
said ``I'm all MOCA'd out.''
</P>
<P>
   The project was finally saved when the Jacob's Pillow dance
center came in as a sponsor, as required by legislation. This also
changed the plan significantly, adding dance, movies and concerts
by Patti Smith and others to the mix.
</P>
<P>
   `'We'll get some arts into it, some theater. It's so simple,'''
Barrett said. ``But it was all by accident,'' he added. ``Looking
back at it now, it's just downright ridiculous, absurd.''

THREE BIG RETAILERS GO SHOPPING FOR CHIEF EXECUTIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   By LESLIE KAUFMAN and DAVID LEONHARDT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Within a few weeks this spring, J.C. Penney, Sears and Kmart all
announced that they were looking for new chief executives. These
separate recruiting drives have essentially created a referendum on
which of the ailing businesses is the sickest.
</P>
<P>
   Finding first-rate talent in the retail industry is notoriously
difficult, in part because the best and the brightest are not drawn
to a business that often makes executive prospects do time as stock
boys.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, each company expects its competitors' searches to
increase the difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a shallow pool and three fishermen instead of one,
the one who gets earliest and spots the jumping fish has an
advantage,'' said Gerard R. Roche, the chairman of Heidrick &AMP;
Struggles, which is conducting Sears' search for Arthur Martinez's
replacement.
</P>
<P>
   The three-way race ``gives a sense of urgency,'' said Hal
Reiter, chief executive of Herbert Mines Associates, a New York
search firm that is widely believed to be conducting the hunt for
Floyd Hall's replacement at Kmart (neither Reiter nor Kmart will
confirm this). It forces companies to ``play the game I call `head
cheerleader,''' he said. ``Everyone wants to date the head
cheerleader.''
</P>
<P>
   But on whose arm do the head cheerleaders want to be escorted?
In many ways, the companies are in similar positions. All three are
retail chains with revenues of about $30 billion to $40 billion a
year, which are being squeezed hard between efficient low-price
discounters like Wal-Mart on the one hand and more
fashion-conscious specialty chains like The Limited and the Gap on
the other.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is general agreement among headhunters and retail
stock analysts that Kmart presents the least desirable opportunity.
The discounter, which was fast losing ground to Wal-Mart, brought
in Floyd Hall, a former executive with Museum Co. and Grand Union
in June 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Hall has gotten the company on a steady train of earnings and
sales growth by introducing private brands such as Sesame Street
Kids and by expanding into Super Kmart formats, extra-large stores
that sell groceries as well as dry goods.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kmart trails its rivals in almost insurmountable ways.
Its real estate is older, its cash flow is weaker and its computer
systems are not as evolved or as integrated into all aspects of the
business. Its stock closed at $7.6875 on Friday, compared with a
52-week high of $17.50.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the Martha factor. Kmart brings in some $1 billion
in annual revenues from the Martha Stewart brand of
200-thread-count bed linens and coordinated pool furniture. The
formidable Stewart has made it clear that Hall has not been as
responsive as she would like and that she would want to work a
little more closely with a new executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``While all our suppliers are important,'' said Kmart
spokeswoman Shawn M. Kahle, ``they do not have a say in the
process. It is a decision to be made by our board of directors.''
Nevertheless, any candidate must know that Stewart and her
penetrating critiques will be constant companions for whoever takes
the job.
</P>
<P>
   It adds up to a particularly challenging package. ``There is
always some reluctance to take on a business perceived as having
problems,'' said Mines. ``The person will have to be smart as well
as courageous.''
</P>
<P>
   The company that might be most attractive to candidates is J.C.
Penney Co. Penney's stock closed Friday at $17.875, compared with a
52-week high of $52.94.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Sears and Kmart have already attempted turnarounds and
made the easiest fixes, like closing the most unproductive stores
and adding more high-margin branded merchandise, there are still
many basic changes to be made at Penney, changes that could lead to
quick payoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``No outsider has yet come into Penney to cull the low-hanging
fruit,'' said Kirk Palmer, who runs a recruiting firm that
specializes in retail jobs. ``There is much more upside potential.
Plenty of room to hit home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Sears is in the best shape of the three, as Martinez has closed
more than 100 underperforming stores and slashed 50,000 jobs. Its
shares closed at $35.375 on Friday, compared with a 52-week high of
$51.19.
</P>
<P>
   But Sears has a rough road ahead, especially as Home Depot has
now taken direct aim at its lucrative appliance business. And
Martinez's successor won't find a lot of obvious fat left to cut.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The last time three rivals had such an obvious face-off was last
summer, when Dell, Hewlett-Packard and Compaq were looking for
chief executives. Christian &AMP; Timbers, a search firm based in
Cleveland, came up with the flashiest find, at least in Carleton S.
Fiorina for Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey E. Christian, who ran the search, offered this advice:
``By definition, great leaders are few and far between. You've got
to find the up-and-comer, the person who will be great.''
</P>
<P>
   But even great leaders have their limits, something that Wall
Street is not likely to forget. Richard L. Church, a stock analyst
for Salomon Smith Barney who follows all three chains, said that a
superstar hire could make a difference in the companies' stock
valuations, but he added, ``The long-term issues these companies
face are formidable.''

TRADE RIFTS OVERSHADOW CLINTON'S MEETING WITH EU 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite the Clinton administration's hope for a
quick resolution to a multibillion-dollar dispute with the European
Union over corporate tax policy, the problem appeared to be
escalating Monday on the eve of President Clinton's meeting with
European leaders in Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued here before Clinton's departure, Stuart E.
Eizenstat, the deputy treasury secretary, said he was ``saddened''
and ``disappointed'' by a rebuff delivered Friday by Pascal Lamy,
the European Union's trade commissioner. Lamy said the
administration's proposed revision in the way some foreign sales by
United States-based corporations were taxed would still not bring
the United States into compliance with the World Trade
Organization's rules against subsidizing exports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We firmly believe that our proposal is WTO compliant, in fact
and in law,'' Eizenstat said in his statement. He added: ``I am
saddened that the EU has not yet seized this opportunity to
negotiate a solution based on our proposal. We are disappointed
that a chance may be lost to accomplish this goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is over a tax break, worth billions of dollars, that
federal law currently allows exporters through the use of ``foreign
sales corporations,'' subsidiaries set up in places like the Virgin
Islands, Barbados and Guam. Overseas sales channeled through these
subsidiaries escape both sales tax and duties. In 1999, hundreds of
United States companies, including Boeing, Microsoft and General
Motors, saved about $4 billion by using these legally sanctioned
offshore tax havens.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an agreement between the United States and the European
Union not to challenge one another's tax policies, the EU
challenged the policy on the ground that amounted to an illegal
effort to subsidize exports by making them more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   An appeals panel of the WTO agreed in a ruling three months ago,
setting off the administration's effort come up with an acceptable
alternative. Eizenstat said Monday that even in the absence of a
negotiated solution, the administration would work with Congress to
enact new tax legislation that in its opinion obviated WTO
objections.
</P>
<P>
   The tax issue is only one of several trade-related disputes,
including skirmishes over bananas, genetically modified products
and aircraft noise, that have cast a shadow over economic relations
between the United States and members of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Under Eizenstat's plan to solve the overseas tax shelter issue,
the United States would repeal the foreign sales corporation plan
and replace it with special income tax rates for both export and
nonexport foreign sales by eligible manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The EU trade officials said, however, the changes meant United
States-based companies would still have to export to benefit _ the
very aspect of the original plan that was condemned by the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   The United States proposal also contained two other elements
that the EU considered incompatible with global trade rules _ a 50
percent United States content requirement for products benefiting
from tax breaks and a transfer pricing plan that allocates a
proportion of profits to the foreign sales corporation.

THE RISK OF WILDFIRE GROWS AS MORE MOVE TO BE NEAR THE FOREST 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The wildfire that swept through Los Alamos, N.M.,
this month is setting off alarms across the mountain West, where
more and more Americans have chosen to live on the forest's edge.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that housing shift has multiplied the danger that
other fires could kindle similar disasters elsewhere. And the shift
is behind an urgent new congressional quest for millions of dollars
in emergency money to try to ease the risk.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze in Los Alamos, which consumed hundreds of homes, was a
pre-emptive fire gone awry. But in communities like Ashland, Ore.,
and Missoula, Mont., whose populations have swelled with former
city dwellers, the fire has served fresh notice that residents sit
astride a volatile mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a matter of if the fire occurs, it's a matter of
when,'' said Paul Summerfelt, a top fire department official in
Flagstaff, Ariz., which is surrounded by the world's largest forest
of Ponderosa pines and where half of the 60,000 residents are said
to face a severe wildfire risk.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, the damage caused by wildfire to homes and
property increased sixfold from the 1980s to the 1990s, to a total
of $3.2 billion over the last 10 years, federal officials say. In
an average year over the past decade, 1,200 homes burned, more than
double the number over the previous decade.
</P>
<P>
   Already this year, more than 40,000 wildfires have consumed more
than 1 million acres _ more than in any similar period since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   With the lesson of Los Alamos in mind, Congress and the Clinton
administration are working on a plan that would focus an urgent new
round of fire-prevention efforts this summer in the danger zones
where populations and wild land meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``As people get their homes closer and closer to nature, they
become more and more at risk,'' said Kenneth O. Burris Jr., chief
operating officer of the U.S. Fire Administration, based in
Emmitsburg, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency measure is being drawn up by Sen. Jeff Bingaman,
D-N.M., and other Western lawmakers with help from the Forest
Service and other federal agencies. It would nearly double, to $115
million from $65 million, the amount of money available to the
government this year for efforts intended to prevent wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the plan would pay for more prescribed fires, like the
one that ignited the Los Alamos blaze, in a fiasco for which the
federal government has accepted responsibility. It would also
emphasize safer but more costly efforts, relying in part on manual
cutting and thinning of the dense, overgrown forests that surround
many Western mountain communities and lie at the heart of the fire
risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The events of the past two weeks in New Mexico demonstrate
that we cannot simply allow nature to take its course,'' Bingaman
wrote in a May 19 letter to Mike Dombeck, the Forest Service chief.
</P>
<P>
   Fire, of course, is a natural event, but few Western forests
remain in their natural state. Experts say the current fire problem
is a legacy of the last 100 years, in which most fires have been
suppressed and large trees logged away, leaving today's forests
unnaturally dense, choked with debris and fire-prone.
</P>
<P>
   Those years of fuel accumulation have made it more likely that
even a small fire caused by lightning will spread. That danger is
reflected in statistics showing that the number of wildfires that
destroy 1,000 acres or more in the United States has increased to a
recent average of about 80 a year from 25 a year in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no doubt, the experts say, that the wildfire
problem has been compounded by rapid population growth in the
nation's most forested states and particularly by the building of
legions of ranchettes, vacation homes and developments near forest
boundaries. That trend has added new fronts to the kind of threat
that has long plagued places like Southern California, where
population growth into remote canyons and hillsides began several
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the proximity of people to forests makes it more
likely that a cigarette or a lawn mower spark, for example, may
ignite a blaze; an estimated 90 percent of wildfires are caused by
humans. Of even more concern, the experts say, is the fact that the
presence of houses makes forest fires more difficult to control,
because priority is given to protecting property, and more
difficult to prevent, because traditional fire prevention methods
like controlled burns are often unpopular with residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've created a situation in which the forest is like a wood
stove,'' said Andy Stahl, who heads the Association of Forest
Service Employees for Environmental Ethics, a group of 13,000
current and former employees based in Eugene, Ore. ``We've loaded
that stove with paper and shavings and sticks and the like, but now
it's sitting in the middle of a living room, and we're telling the
forest managers, OK, take care of this stuff, but don't burn the
house down.''
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, the Forest Service estimates, some 40 million
Americans live in what it calls the urban/wildland interface _
directly adjacent to or scattered within unpopulated areas with
wild land vegetation. The agency's estimate does not say how many
of those people face a wildfire risk, but separate findings by some
fire-prone states leave little doubt that the number is high.
</P>
<P>
   In California and Colorado alone, according to officials there,
about 3 million people face at least a moderate wildfire risk,
including the many who have built new homes in recent years in
areas like the Sierra Nevada foothills in California and Jefferson
County, west of Denver.

</P>
<P>
   A study by Dave Theobold, a researcher at Colorado State
University, focusing on areas within 2 miles of forest boundaries,
found that population densities in those once-remote parts of the
state had quadrupled between 1960 and 1990, even before the last
decade's building boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the states with a lot of forests have through most of
the last decade shown disproportionate growth and disproportionate
home building, and that implies that we're going to have more
people living close to the forest than in the past,'' said Michael
Carliner, an economist with the National Association of
Homebuilders.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   What happened in Los Alamos has dealt a major setback, at least
for now, to prescribed fire, the method most commonly used by
federal officials to reduce fire risks on Forest Service and
National Park Service lands. In that case, what was to have been a
controlled blaze in the Bandelier National Monument quickly spread
out of control, ultimately burning more than 46,000 acres.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-day moratorium on such burning imposed by the federal
government remains in effect, and across the West, the example is
bound to harden local resistance to the setting of blazes like the
one in Los Alamos. Last week, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt
extended the ban indefinitely on park service land.
</P>
<P>
   The main alternative, the manual trimming of countless
commercially worthless small-diameter trees, faces problems of its
own. It is so costly that the Forest Service has typically enlisted
timber companies to do the work as part of contracts that also
allow traditional logging activity. But such arrangements have also
tended to stir strong opposition from environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For example, in Ashland, Ore., a community popular among wealthy
former city dwellers, a Forest Service plan to reduce the risk of a
fire that could cut off the city's water supply has been blocked
for the last four years by critics opposed to the fact that it
would allow timber companies to carry out new logging.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Carroll, a spokesman for the Potlatch Corp., a timber
company based in Spokane, Wash., criticized such opposition as
shortsighted. ``We have got to face reality,'' Carroll said, ``and
what's happening now is that various groups are absolutely bent on
a course of catastrophe for communities in the West.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As one potential model, some congressional and administration
officials have been looking to a project under way in Flagstaff,
where a coalition of government, industry and environmental groups
has begun to make a dent in trimming the dense Ponderosa forest
that extends even within the city limits.
</P>
<P>
   Even there, however, opposition from groups like the Forest
Guardians, an organization based in Santa Fe, N.M., has acted as a
brake. The group opposes what it calls the commercialization of the
national forests, and its executive director, Rex Wahl, suggested
that residents worried about fire danger should not expect someone
else to solve the problem for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They move to the forest and then they want to get rid of the
forest, because it's being touted as a threat to their property,''
Wahl said. ``They need to take some responsibility for the danger
themselves.''

   LISBON, Portugal _ President Clinton arrives here Tuesday,
kicking off a week-long tour through Portugal, Germany, Russia and
the Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   The trip, Clinton said, will spotlight the political, economic
and security gains the continent has made since the end of the Cold
War, as well as the unfinished business of knitting the war-torn
Balkans and the former Soviet states fully into the fabric of
modern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world of today would not be recognized by those who lived
at the beginning of the Cold War,'' Clinton said during Memorial
Day remarks at Arlington Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old adversaries have become allies; dictatorships have become
democracies,'' Clinton said. ``Europe is more peaceful and united;
the communism we fought to contain has collapsed, reformed or been
discredited around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, Clinton was scheduled to leave Andrews Air Force
Base for the six-hour flight to this seaside Portuguese capital.
</P>
<P>
   Hosted by Prime Minister Antonio Guterres, Clinton will visit a
16th Century tower marking the starting point for historic voyages
of discovery by Vasco de Gama and Ferdinand Magellan. Guterres and
Clinton will hold bilateral meetings expected to focus on trade and
security matters, independence in the former Portuguese colony of
East Timor and efforts to rid the developing world of such
infectious diseases as AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   There's serious diplomacy scheduled throughout the week, with a
summit Wednesday with Clinton's counterparts from the European
Union, a Thursday meeting in Berlin with German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder, and a conference on governance in Berlin Friday and
Saturday. The high point of the trip comes, however, when Clinton
travels to Moscow Saturday night for U.S.-Russia talks centered on
nuclear weapons, missile defense and economic and political
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton looks to his first summit meeting with Russia's new
president, former KGB officer Vladimir Putin, the future course of
the former U.S. foe is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question now is not only where Russia is heading, but how
it intends to get there,'' White House National Security Adviser
Samuel Berger told reporters last week.
</P>
<P>
   The trip, though, is also richly symbolic. As Clinton moves
toward the twilight of his presidency, this visit is planned to
showcase what the administration regards as signal achievements in
Transatlantic relations:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  helping to manage European integration;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  quelling a series of Balkan conflicts;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  and reaffirming NATO as a viable, even essential, post Cold
War institution.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts are viewing this week's trip as a sort of victory
lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could well be, and indeed, probably is, this president's
last trip to Europe,'' said Philip Gordon, senior fellow for
foreign policy studies at the Brookings Institution, a Washington
think tank. ``The message from the president about this trip will
be the culmination of a successful strategy in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Gordon, ``It's not a bad record, overall.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics, however, have charged Clinton with fumbling in the
Balkans; he's been variously accused of doing too little and too
much. Similarly in Russia, his critics have said Clinton hasn't
done enough to promote free-market reforms and reduce the nuclear
dangers in the former Soviet states; even as others have said he's
spent too much on both goals.
</P>
<P>
   When he travels to Moscow on Saturday, though, for a day-long
summit the following day, Clinton will try to stress the gains
Russia has made on its uneven journey toward democracy and
free-market capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   With Putin's election in March, for example, ``Russia has just
seen its first transition from one democratically-elected
government to another in 1,000 years of history,'' said Clinton,
who will become the first American president ever to address the
Russian Duma, or parliament, on Monday. Later that day Clinton
travels to the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, for bilateral talks with
President Leonid Kuchma, before returning to Washington late that
night.

IN MAINE, TWO'S A CROWD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 4)  
(Editors: a 300-word information box appears at end of story.) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The question is, just how deep a wilderness experience can you
get in a long weekend without ever leaving New England?
</P>
<P>
   The short answer is: Pretty deep.
</P>
<P>
   The longer answer, reached after three days in the Moosehead
Lake region of central Maine, is:
</P>
<P>
   You can go on an eight-hour hike deep into the North Woods,
passing one roaring churn of a waterfall after another along the
way, and meet nary another soul until you limp back to the parking
lot and run into the nice state wardens who are getting worried
enough to start searching for you.
</P>
<P>
   You can spend the night in a canvas-walled yurt, miles of woods
away from the nearest people, wake up to a view of sky through the
roof and have the euphoria of outdoor sleeping without even lugging
a tent.
</P>
<P>
   You can fly over lake after lake after pristine lake to an
isolated cabin of your own, and know that when you canoe your
territorial waters, there may be moose or deer to challenge you but
no other humans.
</P>
<P>
   And you can fall asleep to such a magically crazy chorus of
clacks and cheeps and peeps and hoots that it seems as sacrilegious
as sleeping through a live symphony concert.
</P>
<P>
   Also, you can bring home an old bearskin rug or a stuffed moose
head to go above your mantel if you are so barbarically inclined.
</P>
<P>
   All these were conclusions my gear-laden friend, Stephen Lines,
a photographer, and I reached on a Friday-to-Sunday trip in May. It
took us from Boston to Greenville _ the town known as the gateway
of the Moosehead Lake region _ to nearby Rockwood, to remote
Mooseleuk Lake and back again.
</P>
<P>
   (Please note: The trip was in May, not June. Only the
rhinoceros-skinned would want to visit inland Maine during
black-fly season. But locals say that most of the nasty biters are
usually gone by the end of June, sometimes earlier.)
</P>
<P>
   I'll get to the natural beauty next, but first, my main point
about wilderness: If hell is other people, then shouldn't heaven be
about getting away from them? Have you noticed how, when you
encounter fellow travelers out in a forest or on a mountain or on
an ocean where you want to feel as if you're exploring, you tend to
resent their existence a million times more than if they jostled
you on a city street?
</P>
<P>
   I mention that because our Moosehead trip provided such
satisfying alone-space. No other hikers on the trails _ though
there would likely be a few in summer _ no other cars on the road
to Greenville for nearly a two-hour late-night stretch, no other
kayakers out where we kayaked, no other canoeists where we canoed.
There was more than breathing room; there was the feeling of
dominion captured in the Dr. Seuss book about Yertle the Turtle,
who was king of all he saw.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, it was affordable dominion, with cabins advertised
for sale in the Northwoods Sporting Journal at $20,000 or so, your
own little yurt rental running just $55 a night, and your own
little cabin, replete with beds for eight, gaslights and canoes for
$100 a night. Some souvenirs did get pricey: the stuffed moose
heads available at Moosehead Traders on Main Street in Greenville
ran well over $1,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Moosehead Lake is a noble old outdoor destination, and its
``camps'' _ Mainespeak for the rustic sites ranging from simple
cabins to fancy lodges _ have drawn hunters, fishermen and nature
lovers for well over a century. Henry David Thoreau described the
region in his ``Maine Woods,'' but anyone writing about the place
always quotes Thoreau, so let's just leave it at that. The lake
itself is about 35 miles long, the largest in Maine and the one of
largest lakes in one single state in New England. It is peppered
with islands, some uninhabited, some housing camps, and it can get
as wild as a sea, with great rollers and gales. (Oh, OK, Thoreau
described it as a ``suitably wild-looking sheet of water, sprinkled
with small, low islands.'')
</P>
<P>
   The region around it is splotched with dozens more lakes, with
Indian names like Nahmakanta and Munsungan and Matagamon. The
Appalachian Trail winds through it, on its way to its northern
terminus on nearby Mount Katahdin, but most of the land is
unprotected paper-company territory, riddled with logging roads,
much of it in various stages of regrowth.
</P>
<P>
   Moosehead is still a major center for the fish and game set, but
it appears to have been shifting a bit in recent years away from
the red-plaid folk and toward the Patagonia purple bunch. Mountain
biking has been taking off here, and kayaking, and ``moose
safaris'' in which the moose survives. Certainly, even for us
gunless, rodless visitors, there was far more to do than a weekend
could encompass.
</P>
<P>
   We flew out of Boston to Bangor on one of the frequent 70-minute
flights run by Business Express, a subsidiary of American Airlines,
grabbed a car in Bangor and reached Greenville in well under a
two-hour drive. There is an unexpected vista as you drive into
Greenville, when the gigantic lake and its islands suddenly spread
themselves serenely out before you.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was to proceed immediately to Gulf Hagas, taking the
eight-hour loop hike through what is billed as the four-mile-long
Grand Canyon of Maine. (This lofty claim occasioned some derision
from us as the hike began, but as we proceeded, we shut up. The
walls may be nowhere near as high, and granite gray rather than
ruddy, but the rushing, crashing, warbling beauty at the bottom
demands reverence.)
</P>
<P>
   First, however, we made a lingering stop in Greenville at Auntie
M's, a home-cookin' restaurant whose moderately priced menu ranges
from an all-you-can-eat fish fry to nonalcoholic daiquiris to
nachos. The member of our party who routinely gets to eat as much
as he wants pronounced both the apple crisp and the fried dough
delicious; the member of our party who doesn't get to eat as much
as she wants, even when she hikes for miles and miles, had a
delectable frozen orange milkshake.
</P>
<P>
   From Greenville, the trailhead of the Gulf Hagas hike was
reachable only over miles upon miles of roads so marginally
passable that the locals in four-wheel-drive vehicles we met raised
eyebrows and exclaimed that we must be pretty fancy drivers to get
so far in a mere car. We had followed the directions on a Moosehead
hiking site, but discovered later that access by road was much
easier from Brownville.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, after about an hour of abusing the rental car and
exhorting each other to keep accelerating through the muddy ruts,
we reached a little park service cabin with a sign outside reading,
``One Old Grouch and One Nice Person Live Here.'' I speculated that
the old man who took our $7 per person was the grouch, but he
claimed it was his wife.
</P>
<P>
   What followed was eight hours of challenging, satisfying
footwork, from the initial precarious barefooting across a wide,
thigh-high river to the innumerable viewpoints the Rim Trail
afforded of large, small and middling waterfalls. The hike consists
of several loops, and so can be cut to just two or three hours for
the less ambitious. But we driven types were at it until well after
dark, thanks to my ever-prepared friend's zoom-lens headlamps.
</P>
<P>
   After a pleasant enough encounter _ well, with overtones of
teen-ager-over-curfew sheepishness _ with the wardens who were just
about to come looking for us, we drove to the Birches, which the
guidebooks tend to call the premier resort on Moosehead Lake. From
the Gulf Hagas area near Brownville, it was a good two-hour drive
to the resort in Rockwood, a tiny town north of Greenville.
</P>
<P>
   The Birches, which is known for cross-country skiing as well as
snowless fun, has an old-style central lodge that does the Maine
thing right down to the great stone fireplace, along with 15
hand-hewn cabins strung along the lakeside.
</P>
<P>
   Then, it has the yurts. So why did we stay in a yurt? Well, have
you ever stayed in a yurt? It seemed different. Also, in the quest
to avoid other humans, it doesn't seem to make much sense to fly
hundreds of miles from civilization and then stay in a little
cluster of cabins where you can hear your neighbors cough.
</P>
<P>
   So the yurt it was, and a pleasant little yurt it seemed. The
Birches has three of them on its 11,000 acres of wilderness
preserve, each sleeping four people. Ours had a bunk bed and futon,
plus pillows, linens, a wood stove and a gas stove, plenty of
chopped wood and a five-gallon container of water. Morning in the
clearing where it stands was so serene it brought to mind the
famous Yeats line from ``The Lake Isle of Innisfree'' about living
in a ``bee-loud glade.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Birches was not serving lunch that day, but its managers
were hospitably easy about letting us take a couple of kayaks from
their boathouse, which is super-well-equipped because the resort
also runs wilderness trips.
</P>
<P>
   Against their cautious warnings about possible rough winds, we
paddled the 45-minute route across the temporarily calm lake to
Mount Kineo, a peninsula that is considered Moosehead's most
striking landmark. Its looming granite cliff rises 763 feet from
the lake and, the guidebooks say, was holy to American Indians,
whose legends turned it into the petrified corpse of a giant,
sin-avenging moose. There was, sadly, no time to hike or rock-climb
to the top of Kineo, where the view is reputed to be one of the
best in New England.
</P>
<P>
   We had a plane to catch. Taking to the air is one of the
Moosehead musts, if simply for a 15-minute tourist ride, and with
good reason. Only then, and especially with a well-informed pilot
like ours, does the big picture emerge: the many rivers dammed into
lakes, the lakes expanded and contracted, the river flow reversals,
the timber-harvesting patterns, the rare swaths of untouched
forest, the moundlike mountains and great snowy Katahdin in the
distance.
</P>
<P>
   We zipped back down to Greenville to the seaplane base of
Folsom's, one of three air companies on the lake, and took off for
Mooseleuk Lake, about a 45-minute flight away.
</P>
<P>
   Our cabin there was one of a dozen outpost cabins owned by Libby
Camps, whose motto is ``A wilderness tradition since 1890.'' There
are dozens of other camps to stay in around the Moosehead region,
but most seem to be in those annoying little clusters. Libby's
offered cabins isolated not only from the rest of the world but
also from one another. O billed marshy Mooseleuk Lake as one of the
best wildlife-watching areas in Maine. (Which it probably is, if
you get up early. I wouldn't know.)
</P>
<P>
   The one-room cabin was exquisitely homey, from the welcoming
wood stove and the front porch to the 20-seat picnic table and the
polished wooden floor. It slept eight, and seemed to be begging for
a 1950s family whose Mom would stay home and cook flapjacks while
Dad went out after deer. There was even a cookbook of camp recipes.
</P>
<P>
   But its most interesting document was a guestbook full of the
scribblings of a decade of visitors. They ranged from heartless
listings like ``25 grouse, (party of 6) eight moose, six deer, camp
was great!'' to ``Not many fish but bugs plentiful, p.s. saw MANY
moose'' and ``Seem to be a few bugs!?''
</P>
<P>
   My favorite was the entry from a newlywed couple who wrote,
``Here to get off the world for a few days.''

   That seemed about right. Who would think you could get this well

WORLD COFFEE PRODUCERS' ALLIANCE AIMS TO DRIVE UP PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER L. RICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Borrowing a page from OPEC's strategy book,
the world's leading coffee producing nations have agreed to
withhold beans from the market to raise the price from seven-year
lows.
</P>
<P>
   But since the countries reached that agreement a little more
than a week ago, cracks in the unity of the Association of Coffee
Producing Countries and its allies have already appeared.
</P>
<P>
   The price of coffee, which surged in the days immediately after
the agreement, has since relinquished much of that gain. The price
of the benchmark robusta beans for July delivery, which rose nearly
$50 a ton, to $980, had slumped back by this past Friday to $932.
Prices had recently been trading as low as $890, the weakest since
1993.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting in London on May 19, the 14-member association, working
with five nonmember coffee producers, said they were prepared to
withhold 20 percent of coffee crops from the market. The producers,
which make up about 85 percent of the world coffee production, said
they would come up with a more detailed plan by June 16 when they
return to London to meet again.
</P>
<P>
   Commodities analysts have grown increasingly skeptical, however.
They point to the lack of specifics about how such a plan would
work in the face of an increasing world supply of coffee beans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is in a vacuum,'' said Arthur Stevenson, a
commodities analyst at Prudential Securities in New York. ``Only
once we find out how the governments involved intend to effectuate
those plans and how they intend to finance them will we know
whether this whole thing has any real legitimacy and credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Doubts about the success of such an agreement started appearing
even before the meeting began, when some of the major world coffee
producers, including leading robusta bean producer Indonesia, said
that they simply lacked the resources to pay coffee growers to hold
back supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that one of the challenges in such a plan is putting
in the financial or economic mechanisms to be able to fund those
within the coffee sectors that would be receiving money to retain
their crop,'' said Robert Nelson, president and chief executive
officer of the National Coffee Association of the United States.
``That is going to be of primary concern to the farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico, one of the association's nonmember observers, along with
Vietnam, Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua, has said that it plans
to offset the lost exports by stimulating domestic consumption of
coffee. But stimulating consumption, which has been successful in
the United States, as evidenced by the appearance of retail coffee
houses like Starbucks and Caribou among others, is a long-term
process that is unlikely to absorb the excess supply of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil, which is the world's leading producer and exporter of
coffee beans, will be the pivotal player in the success of the plan
to withhold coffee beans. At the moment, Brazil seems committed to
ensuring the plan's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government wouldn't being doing all of this if it didn't
want the plan to work,'' said David Nahum Neto, the general
secretary of the Association of the Coffee Industry of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Vinicius Pratini de Moraes, the agriculture minister of
Brazil, said after the meeting in London that the country had
already allocated $167 million to finance the retention of about 3
million 60-kilogram bags of coffee from Brazil's total production
of 1999-2000 of about 27 million bags. The country has also opened
up new warehouse space and changed rules governing export
registration.
</P>
<P>
   But Brazil's coffee industry, which is expected to expand
sharply in the coming years, is taking an increasingly larger share
of the world market. That is something that experts say the country
will be unlikely to jeopardize by restricting supply over the long
term.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, at least, withholding coffee is akin to the
strategy of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to
curtail production of oil. OPEC has been successful over the past
few years in restricting how much each member produces, which has
tripled the price of oil to the highest level in nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   But theory may be where the comparison to coffee ends. Coffee,
unlike oil, is not critical to the world economy, so producers have
less influence over the market. To make matters worse for coffee
exporting countries, history does not provide any examples of
successful agreements to keep beans off the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, these types of agreements have proven ineffective
and unenforceable,'' said Nelson, of the National Coffee
Association of the United States. ``Various countries did not
necessarily abide by the plan, and the association has no legal
framework to enforce the agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the June meeting of the coffee producing nations, analysts
say that coffee prices will remain vulnerable to speculation about
an eventual agreement. Traders will also be keeping a close eye on
Brazil, where the onset of winter weather in June could affect
coffee crops. A damaging frost in the southern coffee belt of
Brazil could render the export ceiling agreement unnecessary.

   Shimon Peres, a former prime minister, was endorsed by Prime
Minister Ehud Barak to succeed President Ezer Weizman, who is
resigning in the wake of a corruption scandal. In a secret ballot
in parliament scheduled for July 31, Peres, minister of regional

   ISRAEL: LESBIANS' LANDMARK VICTORY
</P>
<P>
   An Israeli-American lesbian couple won the right here to
register as the two mothers of their 4-year-old son, Matan,
provoking outrage from the country's religious right. Nicole
Berner-Kadish adopted Matan, the biological son of her partner,
Ruti Berner-Kadish, in California. But the Israeli government
fought their petition to have Matan recognized as Nicole's child
until the High Court, in a groundbreaking ruling for gay couples,
said a child may indeed have two mothers.

<P>
   ISRAEL: PLEA ON WALL RULING
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Ministry said it would ask the Supreme Court to
review a ruling last week that permitted women to hold services at
the Western Wall while wearing prayer shawls and chanting from the
Torah. Asserting that the ruling had changed long-standing
tradition at the site, which limits such services to men, the
ministry said the women could hold prayers at an adjacent location
that would not offend Orthodox worshipers.

   The government that divides authority between the province's

Britain formally restores powers suspended in February. The Irish
Republican Army has agreed to open its hidden arms caches to
international inspectors, and the Ulster Unionists, the largest

<P>
   The Supreme Court rejected a request by relatives to
posthumously pardon Lavrenty Beria, the reviled chief of the NKVD
who sent millions of people to their deaths under Stalin's
dictatorship in the 1930s and '40s. The NKVD later became the KGB.
Beria was executed after Stalin's death in 1953.

<P>
   RUSSIA: PUTIN POSITIVE ON CHECHNYA
</P>
<P>
   President Vladimir Putin suggested he could find common ground
with European critics of the war in Chechnya, saying lawlessness
there will be ``stamped out,'' even if Russian soldiers are the
lawbreakers. After a meeting with European Union officials, Putin
also pledged to cooperate with journalists and rights groups
monitoring the war.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA: REBELS ATTACK
</P>
<P>
   Chechen rebels have apparently begun a broad offense against
Russian troops, and, by their accounts, killing 40 soldiers in an
ambush in the Grozny suburb of Aldi. Russian forces stand accused
of conducting a killing and looting rampage in Aldi last February,
which residents contend left at least 80 civilians dead. Russian
officials denied rebel casualty reports, but said the situation in
Chechnya is ``tense and difficult.''

   WEST-FIRES (Washington) _ The wildfire that swept through Los
Alamos, N.M., earlier this month is setting off alarms across the
mountain West, where more and more Americans have chosen to live on
the forest's edge. Experts say those housing shifts have multiplied
the danger that other fires could kindle similar disasters. They
lie behind an urgent new congressional quest for millions of
dollars in emergency money to try to ease the risk. Across the
country, the damage caused by wildfire to homes and property
increased sixfold between the 1980s and 1990s, to a total of $3.2
billion over the last 10 years, federal officials say. In an
average year over the past decade, 1,200 homes have burned. By

   LABOR-POLITICS (Undated) _ Organized labor may have suffered a
bruising setback when the House of Representatives approved the

stronger after years of decline. After steadily losing influence
for two decades, the labor movement has begun to rebound under John
Sweeney, the AFL-CIO's president, by reversing its membership slide
and by throwing its weight around far more in elections and on
Capitol Hill. Thomas Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, said it would be foolish to dismiss labor's power because

physicians. Several top medical schools are preparing sites of
their own, and there are several commercially operated sites as
well. These Websites reinforce a doctor's knowledge, suggest
diagnoses and provide on-the-spot answers to patients' questions
about their symptoms. In the process, the new Websites and the
other medical information online have the potential to alter the

   NY-SOUTHHAMPTON-TAX (Southampton, N.Y.) _ Behind the privet
hedges that shield the many monstrous mansions in this village by
the sea, something semi-revolutionary is brewing. The rich folks
who summer in the Village of Southampton are up in arms, in a
law-abiding kind of way, about an American principle for which
colonial patriots tossed tea into Boston Harbor: taxation without
representation. This village has been floating in a deep green sea
of property tax money since the 1890s, when plutocrats like W.K.
Vanderbilt began to erect gargantuan houses they called cottages.
Since then, more and more summer people have bought their way into
Southampton, and they pay about three-quarters of the property
taxes. The justice that summer people seek is the right to vote on
village matters while still keeping their permanent residences back
home. By Blaine Harden. (Scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET in ``a''

ANALYSIS: BOTTOM LINE ON SPRINT IS WIRELESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Worldcom Inc. continues to negotiate for the Justice
Department's approval for the company's pending $115 billion
acquisition of Sprint Corp., people close to the talks have said in
recent days that the discussions could lead to the sale of the
Sprint brand and its long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
   Key members of the Justice Department team reviewing the merger
plan have said privately that components of the deal, particularly
in the long-distance telephone business, may violate antitrust
laws. But it is unlikely that those concerns will derail the entire
transaction. Instead, Washington is expected to require that parts
of Sprint be sold to outside companies as a condition for the
merger's approval.
</P>
<P>
   But like Brer Rabbit being thrown into the briar patch, there is
a distinct possibility that at least some of the Sprint units that
the government wants to be spun off are those that Worldcom was
least interested in acquiring, anyway. And any compromise
acceptable to Worldcom is certain to include what it most desires:
Sprint's nationwide wireless operation.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Bernard J. Ebbers, chief executive of WorldCom, and
William T. Esrey, his counterpart at Sprint, met Joel I. Klein,
head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, and talks are
expected to continue into June.
</P>
<P>
   It has been clear since the Worldcom-Sprint deal was announced
last year that Worldcom _ already the No. 1 Internet carrier around
the globe _ would not be allowed to acquire Sprint's Internet
business. That may be somewhat disappointing for Worldcom, but it
certainly will not come as any surprise.
</P>
<P>
   The plans of the regulators and of Worldcom's executives may
diverge, however, on what is meant by ``Sprint's Internet
business.'' And that should be no surprise, either. Indeed, after
Worldcom agreed to acquire MCI in 1999, regulators required that
MCI's Internet business be spun off. But in the eyes of at least
some communications experts, that spin-off was as flawed in its
execution as it was noble in its intent.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? Regulators allowed Worldcom to sell MCI's
Internet customers and Internet switches to Cable &AMP; Wireless of
Britain, but did not require that the deal transfer ownership of
any long-distance fiber-optic communications network. So while
Cable &AMP; Wireless acquired a big business, it found it difficult to
generate profits from that operation, because it still had to buy
long-haul communications capacity from MCI Worldcom.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators are not likely to let themselves be outfoxed in the
same way again. That's why it would be a surprise if the sale of
Sprint's Internet operation did not include at least some
fiber-optic communications assets.
</P>
<P>
   And that will not go over nearly as well with Worldcom's
executive team.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since acquiring the Wiltel fiber-optic network in 1995,
Ebbers has recognized that sustainable profits in the
telecommunications industry rest on ownership of physical assets,
and he will be loathe to give up any of Sprint's.
</P>
<P>
   The same dynamic _ with Worldcom far more willing to give up
customers than network assets _ may very well come into play
regarding Sprint's long-distance telephone business as well.
</P>
<P>
   Some people at the Justice Department appear concerned that a
combined Worldcom-Sprint would control too much of the
long-distance telephone industry. If the department simply asks
Worldcom to sell off Sprint's consumer long-distance unit, the
response will probably be clear: no problem.
</P>
<P>
   Ebbers and other members of his team have never been enamored of
the consumer long-distance market. As far as they are concerned, it
is a low-margin, high-cost sector best left to others, like AT&AMP;T
and, perhaps in the future, the Bell companies.
</P>
<P>
   As long as regulators do not ask Worldcom to sell some of
Sprint's fiber-optic network to go along with them, Worldcom would
probably have no problem selling Sprint's millions of residential
long-distance customers to another telecommunications company.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that discussion, Justice Department regulators have
been expressing concern about Worldcom's control of the Sprint
brand, according to people close to the negotiations. There too it
appears that Worldcom would not protest too much. After all,
Worldcom has already stripped the MCI name from the combined
company's formal identity.
</P>
<P>
   Far thornier than the fate of Sprint's consumer long-distance
business, however, will be the disposition of Sprint's unit that
sells long-distance phone service to business customers. The
regulators may well ask Worldcom to sell big parts of that
operation as well, but at that point Worldcom is likely to throw up
a whole host of arguments.
</P>
<P>
   The long-distance phone business, Worldcom executives have
reasoned, is quickly becoming merely one indivisible component of a
larger basket of communications services that the company sells to
business customers.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely argument goes something like this: If Worldcom
is using a unified network to sell advanced data services in an
integrated bundle along with voice communications and advanced
functions to tie corporate locations together, how can it be
expected to peel out the voice segment?
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, it could be done, analysts say, but it would not be
easy. And it remains unclear how far down that road the Justice
Department is prepared to go.
</P>
<P>
   For all of the concessions that Worldcom will have to make, none
are likely to tarnish the deal's crown jewel: Sprint's wireless
operation. If Sprint did not own a nationwide wireless telephone
network, the acquisition would have never been struck.
</P>
<P>
   Worldcom and Sprint may run into some minor opposition on the
combined companies' extensive holdings of wireless licenses used
for transmitting data to fixed locations. But Worldcom never had a
mobile-phone business, so the cellular component of the deal is not
likely to face any serious hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   And for Ebbers, that appears to be the most important thing.

B.C. RESIDENTS SEEK TO PROTECT THEIR PARADISE FROM PROGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TATLAYOKO LAKE, B.C. _ A quarter-century ago, Fritz and Sally
Mueller crossed the U.S.-Canada border to settle by a lake beneath
10,000-foot-high peaks of British Columbia's Coast Range.
</P>
<P>
   They also moved back in time.
</P>
<P>
   The Muellers put down roots in a land known as British
Columbia's last frontier, a land separated from Vancouver and the
hurry-up lifestyle of today's urban West by 125 miles of peaks, ice
fields, coastal fjords and mountain lakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place reminds me of the West of my youth, of before my
youth,'' said Fritz Mueller, 57, who grew up in Coeur D'Alene,
Idaho. ``We are incredibly lucky to live here,'' said Mueller, a
craftsman who makes classical guitars.
</P>
<P>
   But time may be catching up with a place where pristine
wilderness and a hardy, resourceful human population still coexist.
</P>
<P>
   The clearcuts of industrial forestry, and the luxury resorts
that critics nickname ``industrial tourism,'' are approaching the
remote, sparsely populated hamlets of the Chilcotin Plateau.
</P>
<P>
   Author Chris Harris gave the region its nickname with his 1998
book, ``Chilcotin: British Columbia's Last Frontier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Paradoxically, rich in the natural resources of timber,
minerals and spectacular beauty, the area is in danger of being
destroyed by that which has made it flourish,'' Harris wrote.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, in an age when sprawl, congestion and hurry-up
lifestyles have taken hold almost everywhere, the valley of
Tatlayoko Lake remains gorgeous, easygoing and more heavily
populated by animals than people.
</P>
<P>
   Deer and trumpeter swans winter in pastures at the head of the
lake. Wolves and cougars prey on the deer. Black bears are
numerous. Grizzly bear sightings are not infrequent.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 2,000 people live along the south and west edges of
the Chilcotin Plateau.
</P>
<P>
   They are by necessity a hearty few. The coldest winter
temperature ever recorded in Canada, outside the high arctic, was
taken at Alexis Creek on the Chilcotin Plateau. The thermometer
dipped to more than 60 degrees below zero in the winter of 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Electricity and phone service arrived only in the past decade.
Students from kindergarten to grade 10 are bused from as far as 45
miles away to school in the hamlet of Tatla Lake. Fifty-six
students are enrolled this year. Older 11th and 12th graders must
go live 160 miles away in Williams Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Hogs, horses and chickens still have the run of yards at the
head of Tatlayoko Lake. Cattle wander along the road and a
primitive, grassy airstrip.
</P>
<P>
   Indians were the first human inhabitants of the Chilcotin
Plateau. White pioneers began arriving early this century, led by
K.B. Moore from Massachusetts, whose antecedents donated land that
became the Boston Common.
</P>
<P>
   The adventurous still come. Many of the latest pioneers are from
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of our children, English is a second language,''
said Dale Kerr, who teaches kindergarten and grades 1, 2 and 3 in a
single room at the Tatla Lake school. ``They're predominantly
German. This area draws Germans like nobody's business.''
</P>
<P>
   The Germans are drawn by open spaces, the affordability of land,
and the freedom to do what they want.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Germany, you do only one job,'' said Matthias Hoerolt, who
came here with his wife, Sylvia, to start a guest ranch. ``Here, I
do everything _ cooking, guiding, ranching. ... It's easier to live
in Canada, not so many rules.''
</P>
<P>
   The rules may be few, but the visions of the future of this land
are many.
</P>
<P>
   The provincial government has protected much of it by creating
several large provincial parks, sparing the land from development.
</P>
<P>
   But the B.C. Forest Service takes the view that everything not
in a park is fair game for logging. It has come up with preliminary
plans that envision logging deep into valleys of the Coast Range.
</P>
<P>
   The plans don't sit well with Dennis Redford, a former
California aircraft worker who runs Driftwood Resort, a collection
of weathered cabins on both sides of an old, little-used road that
runs down the east shore of Tatlayoko Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Redford left California for three reasons: ``Too expensive, too
many people, not enough space.''
</P>
<P>
   If cutting comes, the sleepy road that passes through Driftwood
Resort would be a thoroughfare for logging trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would forever change the way we live. We are now so out of
the way on a dead-end road, nobody comes here,'' Redford said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the locals say they don't want to halt logging, only to
limit cutting to sustainable levels and keep it away from prime
fishing, wildlife and view areas.
</P>
<P>
   They recently scored their first success at the west end of the
Chilcotin Plateau.
</P>
<P>
   A citizen roundtable in the village of Anahim Lake managed to
forge an agreement that satisfied fishing resort owners as well as
operators of the local mill.
</P>
<P>
   The accord created a 210,000-acre no-logging zone in an area
called The Alplands, which has the highest concentration of
subalpine lakes in British Columbia. Lodges do a flourishing
business flying fly fishermen into the high lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Another local group, the Tatla Resource Association, is working
to put together a land use plan that will shield the region's way
of life and the beauty of the lake-dotted landscape at the base of
the Coast Range.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the association also say they are not on an
environmental crusade, but they do not want to see lakeside forests
sacrificed to supply mills a five-hour drive away.
</P>
<P>
   They also want to preserve the rhythms and feel of living on a
frontier in the face of another kind of change _ the climbers,
rafters, sailboarders and daredevil skiers who are discovering
remote valleys of the Coast Range, sometimes bringing the 21st
century with them.
</P>
<P>
   Valley matriarch Gerry Bracewell, 77, who has lived here nearly
50 years, says some clients of her family's wilderness adventure
business just refuse to let go of the information age. They carry
cellular phones, look for fax machines and get angry that Vancouver
newspapers lying around local cafes are more than a week old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is in such a hurry, and some people are so strung
out with business. ... Heck, you need a week to unwind from city
living,'' Bracewell said. She guides horse trips deep into the
Coast Range despite having recently recovered from a broken hip.
</P>
<P>
   Bracewell laughs at a new generation of outdoor enthusiasts that
expects luxury when the day's exertions are done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need a hot tub that people jump into naked,'' she
said. ``We take people on a raft out into Tatlayoko Lake where they
can swim with the fish.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of attitude that has been around here for a long
time, and still holds sway.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to his parents, Fritz Mueller Jr., a wildlife
biologist, reflected that for now, the frontier life remains
remarkably intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come to think of it, I'm amazed at how little this
place has changed,'' he said.

WOODS ROLLS TO EASY VICTORY IN MEMORIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ohio _ Winning a golf tournament is not supposed to look
as easy as Tiger Woods made it look Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Woods was like a car on cruise control, and he was never forced
to hit the gas pedal. There was a fleeting moment on the back nine
when Ernie Els closed within four strokes, but Woods birdied the
next hole and Els bogeyed to fall six strokes behind again.
</P>
<P>
   Forget drama. Woods prefers dominance. Starting the day with a
six-stroke lead at the Memorial Tournament, Woods (19 under par)
eased to a five-stroke victory over Ernie Els and Justin Leonard in
an event that ended one day late because of rain on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But for Woods, who won $558,000, the wait was worth it.
Finishing at 269 (71-63-65-70), Woods bogeyed the final hole to
fall one stroke short of the tournament record set by Tom Lehman in
1994. But that was hardly a concern for Woods, who captured his
19th PGA Tour victory at age 24, tying Ben Crenshaw for the most
victories among active full-time tour players. Woods also became
the first player to win the Memorial in back-to-back years, as he
successfully defended a tournament for the first time in his
professional career.
</P>
<P>
   Think Woods is ready for next month's U.S. Open at Pebble Beach?
Consider this. He is the only tour player with four victories this
season. He leads the money list with more than $4.1 million. And in
his last 20 starts on tour, he has 11 victories and 18 top-ten
finishes.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Woods is looking forward to Pebble Beach. His game is
more consistent than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something I've been working toward,'' Woods said.
``That's what you're supposed to do, continue to try and get
better. It doesn't mean you're going to get better, but I'm trying
to get better. I'm trying to give myself chances in every
tournament I play.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods was presented the winner's trophy by Jack Nicklaus, the
tournament host, who won 18 professional major championships, the
record Woods covets most. After watching Woods overwhelm the
Muirfield Village Golf Club course that Nicklaus designed, while
averaging 298.9 yards in driving distance, Nicklaus was asked to
compare his game in his prime to Woods'.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was hitting the ball the way I wanted to, I always felt
like everybody else was going to play for second,'' said Nicklaus,
who at age 60 tied for 65th place after a final-round 73. ``I think
he feels the same way. Nobody in golf today can stand there with a
driver and say, `I'm going to hit the ball 295 yards and shape it
the way I want to shape it and put it on that side of the fairway.'
He is the only guy that can do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he manages his game well. I managed my game well. I
think he can play right-to-left, or left-to-right. He probably
plays better right-to-left than I did. He's got a far better short
game than I ever had. His short game is phenomenal. He's got every
shot around the green. He's a terrific putter, but I think I was a
good putter, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods ended any chance for suspense early, with birdies on Nos.
3, 6 and 8 to reach 20 under par. Terrific approach shots set up
each birdie. At No. 3, he hit a pitching wedge shot to six feet
from the hole. At No. 6, he hit a 9-iron to four feet. At No. 8, he
hit a 9-iron to six feet.
</P>
<P>
   From that point, his march toward victory was almost a
formality. Els had the best round of the day, a 65, while Leonard
was solid with a final-round 68. But Els and Leonard were playing
for second place. And when asked what he would do if Woods got even
better, Els had to smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's 24, I guess he's got to get better,'' Els said. ``In his
own mind, he can get better. In everybody else's mind, he's
probably as good as we want to see him.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Leonard's first top 10 finish this year, and he hoped it
signaled the end to his yearlong slump.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told myself that no matter how I played today, I was going
to take some positives from this week,'' Leonard said. ``This is
the first time I even came close to putting four rounds together.
It was much needed in my case.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods does not seem to need much of anything, and no matter how
much he wins, the feeling never gets old. ``It's not easy,
especially how deep the fields are now,'' he said. ``I appreciate
every victory I get.''  &QL;

YANKS WIN, 4-1, DESPITE BEING VICTIMIZED BY UNASSISTED TRIPLE
PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fourteen hours later, it was no longer Roger against
Pedro in front of a spellbound crowd on a memorable night at Yankee
Stadium. Instead, it was Andy against Omar on a more subdued
afternoon. There were different names and a drastically inferior
ring to Monday's two starting pitchers, but Andy Pettitte's
performance was as superb as what Roger Clemens and Pedro Martinez
had done on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte was not as overpowering as Roger and Pedro, and there
was almost no need for a K corner because he struck out only three
batters, but he allowed just two hits in calmly guiding the Yankees
to a 4-1 victory over the Oakland Athletics. Jason Giambi doubled
in the first inning, and Pettitte did not permit another hit until
Randy Velarde, who turned the 10th unassisted triple play in major
league history Monday, homered in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   While Pettitte opposed Omar Olivares, not Pedro or the Red Sox,
he was as dominant in efficient fashion. Pettitte used a sinking
fastball, a cut fastball and precise control to induce 17
groundouts and erase any possibility that the Yankees would
experience a hangover on the day after Boston stymied them and on
the day they received their 1999 World Series rings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed that game,'' Tino Martinez said. ``Last night was a
draining game for us. It was a tough game to lose. To come back
today at 1 p.m., we wanted to find a way to win this game. Andy
picked us up big time.''
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte was like a frustrating pitching machine to a team that
leads the American League in runs scored. Put in a dollar, watch
Pettitte uncork sinking fastballs and the A's slap grounders. He
uncorked 110 pitches in the complete game and estimated that 65 of
them were sinkers. There were no reasons for Pettitte, who clutched
his three-carat diamond World Series ring after winning his second
straight start, to tinker with what has generally worked for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a special day, us getting the rings,'' Pettitte said.
``It reminded us that we are the world champs. I definitely wanted
to go out there and pitch like I was a pitcher for the world
champs.''
</P>
<P>
   The game took 2 hours 30 minutes, and the Yankees appreciated
how quickly Pettitte worked in twirling the first two-hitter of his
career. His speedy pace allowed some of the Yankees to dress,
shower and breeze to Madison Square Garden for the Knicks-Pacers
game.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte also kept the infielders alert, especially the
embattled Chuck Knoblauch, who might have had his best defensive
game as a Yankee with nine assists from second base and a sweet
basket catch of a pop-up along the right-field line.
</P>
<P>
   Six days ago, Knoblauch made a terrible throw that bounced about
30 feet from first base against the Chicago White Sox. Afterward,
he hinted at retirement while discussing the stress from the
throwing woes that have hampered him since the 1998 season. But
eight of Knoblauch's nine throws to first against the A's were
solid, and he ranged behind second to field a carom off Pettitte's
glove and complete a snazzy play in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a step in the right direction,'' Knoblauch said. ``The
hardest thing for me to do sometime is give myself credit. Maybe
today I have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch's two-out single in the third was the first hit
against Olivares, and he scored when Derek Jeter smashed a double
into the left-field corner. Bernie Williams tripled to knock in the
second run in the sixth, the third run scored that inning on
Velarde's error and Williams added a homer in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Velarde followed his error by spearing Shane Spencer's liner
with two runners moving for the 10th unassisted triple play in
history.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this day was mostly about Pettitte. Giambi called it
death to hit grounders at the Stadium because the grass is thick,
so Pettitte used the perfect way to kill the A's. Pettitte was not
Roger or Pedro, there were 41,284 fans at the game instead of the
sellout crowd Sunday night and the opponents were not the hated Red
Sox. But Pettitte, in his own way, dominated like the pitchers who
were on the same mound several hours before him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to have a good game,'' Pettitte said. ``Them guys are
in a class of their own. I wanted to go out and get groundballs and
throw strikes. Those are the keys for me. I can't remember feeling
better than I did today.''

   AIN EL HILWE, Lebanon _ For the Palestinians who have lived for
half a century in squalid, supposedly makeshift refugee camps in
Lebanon, the Israeli troop withdrawal proved a bittersweet
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone else, they were swept up in the euphoria of what
was seen here as the powerful Israeli army's being routed by
guerrilla forces after a 22-year-long David and Goliath battle.
Although the Palestinians live a life apart from the Lebanese, they
joined the national traffic jam, jangling in battered cars along
the coastal highway into the liberated occupation zone.
</P>
<P>
   For them, however, the moment was distinctly powerful: From the
newly opened border area, they could gaze on the hills of what they
consider their land. For an entire generation of Palestinians in
Lebanon, it was the very first glimpse, and suddenly, painfully,
they felt both closer and farther than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Given the Lebanese joy, the moment also painfully underscored
just how distant is the Palestinians' ever-more-elusive goal of
returning as they increasingly feel abandoned by the Palestinian
leadership in Gaza City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a man, but I wept like a baby,'' said Ahmad Kuleib, 19,
who was born in this camp, as was his father before him. ``I never
understood how deprived I was until that day, when I pathetically
waved a Palestinian flag behind a fence at the Israeli border.''
</P>
<P>
   This camp sits in the south, near Sidon, behind a Lebanese army
barrier that looks like a conceptual sculpture _ red and white
barrels piled precariously among sandbags sprouting weeds as tall
as a child. Inside, even though their tents long ago gave way to
concrete shacks with corrugated tin roofs, tens of thousands of
Palestinians remain organized by the villages that their families
left in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Kuleib, for instance, lives on Mazra Alley, named for his
grandparents' town near Acre, in northwest Israel. Mazra Alley is 2
feet wide in a camp that covers 1 square mile. Because the only
permitted construction is upward, the ad hoc second and third
stories hang over and dim the alley during the broadest daylight.
Jury-rigged electrical wires braid into a spidery lattice overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Kuleib, who wore a backward baseball cap and a T-shirt that says
``Palestine,'' is nominally a carpenter, as is his older brother,
Wael. But there is little work inside the camp, and no work
outside, where they rarely venture. The Palestinians have no civil
rights in Lebanon, and most professions are forbidden to them. The
camp has a 70 percent unemployment rate and depends for income on
black market labor, smuggling, international welfare and
remittances from Palestinian guest workers in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Idleness defines the camp, which gives everyone much time to
polish _ literally _ the keys to their family homes in what is now
Israel. They also smoke water pipes, play cards and attend meetings
of the diverse political factions that divide the camps, in which
they assess and re-assess their struggle, always coming to the same
dead end.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've written us off,'' said Mohd Hussein Kuleib, 45,
Ahmad's father, referring to Palestinian and world leaders. ``We
don't exist anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   While the refugees have had that neglected feeling for some
time, it is rarely given voice. Recently, it has crept over them
with intensity as the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have entered
the final rounds. But then it hit particularly hard as the recent
events unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stressing the positive, I'd like to say that it was inspiring
to see that Israel is not divine and that it can be beaten,'' said
Chafik al-Hout, the former and now de facto Palestine Liberation
Organization representative in Beirut and an unharnessed critic of
Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at the same time, we can't hide our frustration, owing to
the fact that we have lost on our two tracks,'' he continued. ``We
have tried the armed struggle, which didn't lead to anything, and
unfortunately our Arafat opted for the diplomatic track. That began
with the very stupid decision to postpone the issue of refugees and
will end with Arafat in the Guinness Book of World Records for
concessions.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel has consistently rejected the right of return for the
Palestinian refugees, and Prime Minister Ehud Barak repeated this
as one of his four ``red lines.'' In Arafat's oratory, the right of
return of the refugees is still a sacred and primary demand. But in
the reality of the peace talks, the refugee issue has never been
given priority because each side's position is so intractable.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians constitute the largest refugee group in the
world. There are 3.5 million registered with the U.N. Relief and
Works Agency, which provides them with education, health care,
relief and social services. Refugee advocates say the total number
is 4.9 million. Israel dismisses both numbers as inflated but
offers none of its own.
</P>
<P>
   About 400,000 Palestinians are registered in Lebanon, but only
about half actually live there while the rest emigrated temporarily
or permanently to Europe, their leaders say. Of 12 camps, Ain el
Hilwe is the largest, with about 41,000 refugees, according to the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   In the fighting in the late 1940s, many thousands of
Palestinians became refugees, many of them forcefully expelled by
the Jewish troops while others fled out of fear. Many of these
refugees ended up in Lebanon, while others went to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Experts speculate that if there is any kind of peace agreement
by September, it could include the right of return for a fraction
of refugees to the Palestinian-ruled West Bank and Gaza. It could
also allow the return to Israel, under a family reunification
policy, of some Palestinians displaced in 1967 rather than 1948.
And it could set up an international body to settle refugees abroad
and to compensate them.
</P>
<P>
   But it is extremely unlikely that millions of Palestinian
refugees will be returning to their land any time soon. Even if an
agreement is reached and a Palestinian state declared, it is
possible that the issue in its entirety will be deferred.
</P>
<P>
   If so, Lebanon certainly has no intention of resettling the
Palestinians in Lebanon, as it has made clear with its policy of 50
years' duration of keeping their status a temporary one. In a rare
interview last week, with CNN, President Emile Lahoud went out of
his way to stress that the Palestinian refugee issue must be
solved, but his was not an expression of Arab solidarity. To admit
and enfranchise the Palestinians, who are Sunni Muslims, in a land
whose Muslims are predominantly Shiite, would upset the precarious
Muslim-Christian religious and ethnic balance in a country long
riven by sectarianism.

</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that unites the Lebanese is their `no' to the
integration of Palestinians,'' Suhel Natour, an intellectual and a
leader of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine,
said as he smoked a pipe in his tattered, book-lined office in the
small Beirut camp of Mar Elias.
</P>
<P>
   His faction, like most groups here, rejects the peace effort
that began in Oslo, Norway.
</P>
<P>
   But the refugees themselves do not want to stay in Lebanon
anyway. Experts agree that of all the Palestinian refugees, those
in Lebanon are the most depressed because of their complete
marginalization by Lebanon and their bitter, bloody history here _
epitomized by the massacre of hundreds of Palestinians in the Sabra
and Shatila camps by Lebanese groups allied with Israel in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   In his interview, Lahoud also noted, with distress, that Lebanon
was the only country with a refugee population that was fully
armed. On a recent day here, weapons were not visible on the
street. But the Kuleib family freely acknowledges that most men in
the camp own them.
</P>
<P>
   Israel fears that those men, in the frustration of their
decades-long limbo, offer fertile ground for manipulation by Syria,
whose troops control some of the camps. A recent Foreign Ministry
report contended, ``Syria has been preparing Palestinian terrorist
groups for armed operations, laying the groundwork for continued
attacks against Israel even after the withdrawal.'' And, indeed,
last week, the Syrian-abetted Hezbollah, or Party of God, loudly
advised the Palestinians to follow its model of armed struggle.
</P>
<P>
   But most here, from the leaders to the street vendors, said that
they did not see that path in their near future and that their
capabilities, even aided by Syria, are being overestimated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would give up everything I have here for a tent on the
border,'' said Walid Khader Saadeldin, 41, whose parents' village
lies just on the other side. ``I am ready to sacrifice. But we
cannot liberate Palestine from the south of Lebanon. We don't have
the capacity, and the border can no longer be infiltrated. If armed
struggle returns, it has to come from those Palestinians on the
inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Mohd Kuleib agreed. ``Lebanon will revolt, even against Syria,
if it is once more used as a battlefield for the Palestinian
cause,'' he said. ``It was our presence here that drew them into
the whole mess in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many here found the televised scenes of the brief
Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza two weeks ago to be
heartening. If the people fought so for the release of prisoners,
they said, imagine what they would do if the refugees were
forgotten in the final negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every refugee has relatives inside,'' said Fuad Ahman, 40, a
friend of the Kuleibs. ``So they will have a battle on both sides
that makes the intifada look like a Ping-Pong game.'' The intifada
was the Palestinian uprising that began in the late 1980s and ended
in the peace negotiations in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be very bloody indeed,'' said Mohd Kuleib, smiling
and engaging in the gallows humor that permeates the camp. ``I've
had a lot of children, so I could afford to lose one or two.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kuleib family squeezes 15 members into a three-room house
whose pink facade lights up the alley. Mohd Kuleib and his son
Ahmad spoke in the room where they were both born, under a tapestry
depicting Mecca. Sitting on a bed in a floral housecoat, Mohd's
mother, Bahiya, 80, said she still closes her eyes and smells the
sweet air of her village, fragrant with oranges and lemons in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to spend my life outside, but since we left, I've
pretty much been in this room,'' she said, hugging her youngest
grandchild. ``I once had orange trees, fig trees, olive trees. Now
I have but these bare walls.''

CONSPICUOUS ABSENCE OF BLACK WAITERS IN ELITE CITY RESTAURANTS A
CONCERN

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In New York City's restaurant firmament, where
establishments ceaselessly open and close, where fortunes are made
and lost overnight, and where chefs can go as hot and as cold as
the soup, there are few unchanging truths.
</P>
<P>
   But one reality has dominated the city's enormous inventory of
distinguished restaurants: a scarcity of black waiters and
waitresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``For anyone who eats in high-end restaurants in Manhattan, it
is impossible to ignore the fact that there is very little, if any,
diversity in many, many restaurants,'' said Andrew G. Celli Jr.,
the bureau chief for civil rights in the New York state attorney
general's office. ``It's really in your face.''
</P>
<P>
   While more than 26 percent of New York City's population is
black, only 10.5 percent of its 48,176 waiters and waitresses are
black, according to 1996 census data. Since many of those are
working in low-end neighborhood restaurants, the racial disparity
among waiters in mid-to-high-priced places is greater.
</P>
<P>
   For many city restaurantgoers, though, that truth takes awhile
to sink in.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are so used to the exclusion of African-Americans, you
don't even notice,'' said David Paterson, a black state senator.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the disparity are as complicated as diners'
orders. Interviews with dozens of restaurant owners and waiters,
and with state, city and labor leaders reveal an industry that
acknowledges a dearth of black waiters, but offers several reasons
for their absence.
</P>
<P>
   At many Chinese, Japanese, Italian and other ethnic restaurants,
for instance, owners say that they employ no blacks as waiters
because they need to hire employees sharing their own backgrounds.
They say that customers demand the authenticity implied by the
presence of ethnic waiters in ethnic restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Other restaurateurs say few blacks apply for the jobs even
though new restaurants are plentiful and waiters are scarce. And
both black waiters and leaders acknowledge that black Americans may
be rejecting what they perceive as a servile profession.
</P>
<P>
   But many blacks working in high-end restaurants in New York City
say that the real reason their numbers are so small is racism.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting jobs could have considerable economic significance in
black neighborhoods where boom times have certainly not brought
full employment. Jobs in the city's 20,000 restaurants have
increased 24 percent since 1992 in an industry that generated about
$7.2 billion in revenues in 1998. Waiters at top city restaurants
can earn from $40,000 to $70,000 a year or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Restaurant jobs are stepping stones into careers and
opportunities for many,'' said Lloyd Williams, president of the
Greater Harlem Chamber of Commerce. ``There is absolutely no
question that blacks are being discriminated against as waiters and
waitresses.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly many black waiters perceive this to be true. Chris
Harvey, a waiter at Aquagrill, said he had been shut out of
previous jobs because of his skin color. ``Young whites come and
go, but it takes me longer to find a job,'' Harvey said. ``So when
I find a place, I stay.''
</P>
<P>
   George Thomas, 35, remembered the days when he was trying to get
a toehold in the industry. ``I have faxed restaurants with my
qualifications,'' recalled Thomas, who is black, ``and they
expressed excitement. Then they saw me in person, and the whole
conversation changed.''
</P>
<P>
   He kept applying for jobs, refused to take no as an answer, and
became a waiter, a maitre d'hotel and sommelier at Gotham Bar and
Grill. He later became a waiter captain at the three-star
restaurant Daniel, and for the last year, he has been a captain at
the four-star Bouley Bakery.
</P>
<P>
   But his is the exceptional story. ``In some respects there is a
ceiling for black people,'' Thomas said, adding that in regard to
managers, maitres d'hotel and captains, ``there are not many blacks
at fine restaurants.''
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Daniel Smalls, 36, a former waiter, is now the
manager of Guastavino's, where 40 percent of the waitstaff of 120
is black. ``A lot of black people began to apply here when they saw
me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   White waiters predominate at many of New York's better-known
restaurants. For example, of the 10 waiters and 5 captains in the
dining room of La Cote Basque, the haute cuisine doyenne, none are
black.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of the eight waiters and three captains at Le Perigord,
the 36-year-old French grande dame, is dark-skinned _ a server from
Bangladesh. Of the 48 waiters in the dining room and banquet
operation of the four-star Le Cirque 2000, two are black.
</P>
<P>
   But the owners of Le Perigord, La Cote Basque and Le Cirque 2000
say they do not have racist employment policies. ``The majority of
our people working here are minorities,'' said Sirio Maccioni, the
owner of Le Cirque 2000, ``including our chef,'' who is Cambodian.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Brooks Bitterman, research director of Local 100
of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International
Union, which organizes the city's nonhotel waiters, said the
whiteness of waiters was striking considering ``that 99 percent of
low-wage kitchen workers are nonwhite minorities, Hispanics and
Asians.'' Bitterman added, ``That contrasts with white senior cooks
in many kitchens, and the primarily white front-of-house staffs.''

</P>
<P>
   While women's groups and the state attorney general's office
have challenged gender discrimination at some of New York's elite
restaurants, racial discrimination has not really registered on the
official radar screen. Celli of the attorney general's office said,
``We have several open investigations involving several high-end
luxury restaurants,'' but these cases focus on gender
discrimination. Racial discrimination may be involved, he added,
because ``when you look at one thing, you often find other sorts of
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Restaurant discrimination cases have traditionally been
difficult to prove, but in 1998, the Federal Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission won a prosecution at the Harley-Davidson
Cafe: an African-American waitress, Lisa McDonald, won $175,000
after complaining that she had been verbally insulted (she accused
the manager of saying ``you look like Buckwheat'') and ordered to
redo her hair at the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1999, the Times Square Brewery agreed to pay
$450,000 to $650,000 to settle a lawsuit involving accusations of
discrimination and racial slurs, filed on behalf of 27 employees,
but it admitted no wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, of the Harlem chamber of commerce, suggested that a
more representative labor organization might encourage black
waiters to enter the restaurant industry. Yet currently only a
little more than 10 percent of the city's waiters are represented
by the two principal restaurant unions. Leaders of Local 6 of the
Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union said
the union has little control over whom restaurants hire. The local
represents nearly 4,000 New York hotel waiters earning $25,000 to
$100,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, some unionized restaurants contend that tenure
rules make new job openings for blacks very scarce. ``Our waiters
are here for life, and last September we had our first job opening
in three or four years,'' said Georges Briguet, owner of Le
Perigord, explaining how he had hired the restaurant's Bangladeshi
server.
</P>
<P>
   Individual restaurateurs have made efforts to hire more blacks.
Danny Meyer, co-owner of the Union Square Cafe, Gramercy Tavern,
Tabla and 11 Madison Park, said that five years ago, he became
concerned about the ``sameness'' of his front-of-house staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked managers why the staff wasn't more diverse,'' Meyer
said. ``I wasn't satisfied with their answer that `no minorities
applied.'''
</P>
<P>
   So Meyer gave blacks visible jobs as hostesses and maitres
d'hotel, blacks noticed and began applying, and ``things have
changed dramatically now that we have people of color right at the
front door.'' He added that now his staff is more diverse and so is
his clientele.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer does not insist that his Indian-themed restaurant, Tabla,
employ only Indian waiters. Some restaurateurs, though, maintain
that they cannot hire black servers because doing so may make
ethnic restaurants seem less authentic to customers. ``In the
older, high-end French and Italian places _ where the proprietor is
of a certain age _ these people want to surround themselves with
members of their own culture and their own age,'' said Eric Weiss,
whose company, Service Arts Inc., has hired the staffs of many
high-end restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   But Peter Ward, president of Local 6 of the hotel and restaurant
employees' union, said that ``it is ridiculous to suppose that you
need to be Italian to serve Italian food.''
</P>
<P>
   Some black waiters say they have faced racism from customers,
too. Thomas said he would not soon forget the customer at Gotham
Bar and Grill who told him, ``For a colored boy, you're not too
bad.'' And Smalls of Guastavino's, who previously worked his way up
to manager at the four-star Jean Georges, remembers customers there
who kept insisting on speaking to the real boss. ``I'd have to say
to them, `No, the manager _ that's me,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some blacks say that another problem is the lack of black chefs
in New York City's finest kitchens. Carl Redding Jr., 36, said that
he was not able to find a top cooking position in a white-owned
restaurant, so he opened his own, Amy Ruth's, which serves up
home-style Southern cuisine on West 116th Street in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   But Redding said that racism works both ways: ``there is racism
on the part of blacks against whites,'' meaning that several Harlem
restaurants hire only black waiters.
</P>
<P>
   Bedelia Woods of Sylvia's, the soul-food landmark in Harlem,
said that this is not the case at her restaurant. ``Our doors are
open to everybody,'' said Woods, a daughter of the owner, Sylvia
Woods. She added that when white servers answer the restaurant's
job advertisements and ask for directions, ``when we say uptown in
Harlem, they may not come.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for the scarcity of black waiters, some
suggest, may be a self-fulfilling prophecy. ``Young
African-American women and men don't go out for those jobs,'' State
Senator Paterson said. ``They think those jobs are closed off to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   And it may be that the idea of serving people is the hurdle.
Perhaps other blacks ``think it's a belittling job,'' Smalls
suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Can patrons change the status quo? Some black leaders suggest
that their buying power can speak volumes. ``We should not eat
where we can't work,'' said State Assemblyman Keith L. Wright, who
represents Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Celli of the attorney general's office agreed that the diners
hold the cards. ``The restaurant industry is driven by consumer
likes and dislikes,'' he said. ``If we change the culture so that,
as a society, it is no longer attractive to have an all-white,
all-male work force, then the customer will have to be right. And
there will be change.''

   ``I'm a man, but I wept like a baby,'' said Ahmad Kuleib, 19,
who was born in this camp, as was his father before him. ``I never
understood how deprived I was until that day, when I pathetically
waved a Palestinian flag behind a fence at the Israeli border.''
</P>
<P>
   This camp sits in the south, near Sidon, behind a Lebanese army
barrier that looks like a conceptual sculpture _ red and white
barrels piled precariously among sandbags sprouting weeds as tall
as a child. Inside, even though their tents long ago gave way to
concrete shacks with corrugated tin roofs, tens of thousands of
Palestinians remain organized by the villages that their families
left in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Kuleib, for instance, lives on Mazra Alley, named for his
grandparents' town near Acre, in northwest Israel. Mazra Alley is 2
feet wide in a camp that covers 1 square mile. Because the only
permitted construction is upward, the ad hoc second and third
stories hang over and dim the alley during the broadest daylight.
Jury-rigged electrical wires braid into a spidery lattice overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Kuleib, who wore a backward baseball cap and a T-shirt that says
``Palestine,'' is nominally a carpenter, as is his older brother,
Wael. But there is little work inside the camp, and no work
outside, where they rarely venture. The Palestinians have no civil
rights in Lebanon, and most professions are forbidden to them. The
camp has a 70 percent unemployment rate and depends for income on
black market labor, smuggling, international welfare and
remittances from Palestinian guest workers in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Idleness defines the camp, which gives everyone much time to
polish _ literally _ the keys to their family homes in what is now
Israel. They also smoke water pipes, play cards and attend meetings
of the diverse political factions that divide the camps, in which
they assess and re-assess their struggle, always coming to the same
dead end.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've written us off,'' said Mohd Hussein Kuleib, 45,
Ahmad's father, referring to Palestinian and world leaders. ``We
don't exist anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   While the refugees have had that neglected feeling for some
time, it is rarely given voice. Recently, it has crept over them
with intensity as the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have entered
the final rounds. But then it hit particularly hard as the recent
events unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stressing the positive, I'd like to say that it was inspiring
to see that Israel is not divine and that it can be beaten,'' said
Chafik al-Hout, the former and now de facto Palestine Liberation
Organization representative in Beirut and an unharnessed critic of
Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at the same time, we can't hide our frustration, owing to
the fact that we have lost on our two tracks,'' he continued. ``We
have tried the armed struggle, which didn't lead to anything, and
unfortunately our Arafat opted for the diplomatic track. That began
with the very stupid decision to postpone the issue of refugees and
will end with Arafat in the Guinness Book of World Records for
concessions.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel has consistently rejected the right of return for the
Palestinian refugees, and Prime Minister Ehud Barak repeated this
as one of his four ``red lines.'' In Arafat's oratory, the right of
return of the refugees is still a sacred and primary demand. But in
the reality of the peace talks, the refugee issue has never been
given priority because each side's position is so intractable.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians constitute the largest refugee group in the
world. There are 3.5 million registered with the U.N. Relief and
Works Agency, which provides them with education, health care,
relief and social services. Refugee advocates say the total number
is 4.9 million. Israel dismisses both numbers as inflated but
offers none of its own.
</P>
<P>
   About 400,000 Palestinians are registered in Lebanon, but only
about half actually live there while the rest emigrated temporarily
or permanently to Europe, their leaders say. Of 12 camps, Ain el
Hilwe is the largest, with about 41,000 refugees, according to the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   In the fighting in the late 1940s, many thousands of
Palestinians became refugees, many of them forcefully expelled by
the Jewish troops while others fled out of fear. Many of these
refugees ended up in Lebanon, while others went to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Experts speculate that if there is any kind of peace agreement
by September, it could include the right of return for a fraction
of refugees to the Palestinian-ruled West Bank and Gaza. It could
also allow the return to Israel, under a family reunification
policy, of some Palestinians displaced in 1967 rather than 1948.
And it could set up an international body to settle refugees abroad
and to compensate them.
</P>
<P>
   But it is extremely unlikely that millions of Palestinian
refugees will be returning to their land any time soon. Even if an
agreement is reached and a Palestinian state declared, it is
possible that the issue in its entirety will be deferred.
</P>
<P>
   If so, Lebanon certainly has no intention of resettling the
Palestinians in Lebanon, as it has made clear with its policy of 50
years' duration of keeping their status a temporary one. In a rare
interview last week, with CNN, President Emile Lahoud went out of
his way to stress that the Palestinian refugee issue must be
solved, but his was not an expression of Arab solidarity. To admit
and enfranchise the Palestinians, who are Sunni Muslims, in a land
whose Muslims are predominantly Shiite, would upset the precarious
Muslim-Christian religious and ethnic balance in a country long
riven by sectarianism.

</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that unites the Lebanese is their `no' to the
integration of Palestinians,'' Suhel Natour, an intellectual and a
leader of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine,
said as he smoked a pipe in his tattered, book-lined office in the
small Beirut camp of Mar Elias.
</P>
<P>
   His faction, like most groups here, rejects the peace effort
that began in Oslo, Norway.
</P>
<P>
   But the refugees themselves do not want to stay in Lebanon
anyway. Experts agree that of all the Palestinian refugees, those
in Lebanon are the most depressed because of their complete
marginalization by Lebanon and their bitter, bloody history here _
epitomized by the massacre of hundreds of Palestinians in the Sabra
and Shatila camps by Lebanese groups allied with Israel in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   In his interview, Lahoud also noted, with distress, that Lebanon
was the only country with a refugee population that was fully
armed. On a recent day here, weapons were not visible on the
street. But the Kuleib family freely acknowledges that most men in
the camp own them.
</P>
<P>
   Israel fears that those men, in the frustration of their
decades-long limbo, offer fertile ground for manipulation by Syria,
whose troops control some of the camps. A recent Foreign Ministry
report contended, ``Syria has been preparing Palestinian terrorist
groups for armed operations, laying the groundwork for continued
attacks against Israel even after the withdrawal.'' And, indeed,
last week, the Syrian-abetted Hezbollah, or Party of God, loudly
advised the Palestinians to follow its model of armed struggle.
</P>
<P>
   But most here, from the leaders to the street vendors, said that
they did not see that path in their near future and that their
capabilities, even aided by Syria, are being overestimated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would give up everything I have here for a tent on the
border,'' said Walid Khader Saadeldin, 41, whose parents' village
lies just on the other side. ``I am ready to sacrifice. But we
cannot liberate Palestine from the south of Lebanon. We don't have
the capacity, and the border can no longer be infiltrated. If armed
struggle returns, it has to come from those Palestinians on the
inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Mohd Kuleib agreed. ``Lebanon will revolt, even against Syria,
if it is once more used as a battlefield for the Palestinian
cause,'' he said. ``It was our presence here that drew them into
the whole mess in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many here found the televised scenes of the brief
Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza two weeks ago to be
heartening. If the people fought so for the release of prisoners,
they said, imagine what they would do if the refugees were
forgotten in the final negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every refugee has relatives inside,'' said Fuad Ahman, 40, a
friend of the Kuleibs. ``So they will have a battle on both sides
that makes the intifada look like a Ping-Pong game.'' The intifada
was the Palestinian uprising that began in the late 1980s and ended
in the peace negotiations in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be very bloody indeed,'' said Mohd Kuleib, smiling
and engaging in the gallows humor that permeates the camp. ``I've
had a lot of children, so I could afford to lose one or two.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kuleib family squeezes 15 members into a three-room house
whose pink facade lights up the alley. Mohd Kuleib and his son
Ahmad spoke in the room where they were both born, under a tapestry
depicting Mecca. Sitting on a bed in a floral housecoat, Mohd's
mother, Bahiya, 80, said she still closes her eyes and smells the
sweet air of her village, fragrant with oranges and lemons in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to spend my life outside, but since we left, I've
pretty much been in this room,'' she said, hugging her youngest
grandchild. ``I once had orange trees, fig trees, olive trees. Now
I have but these bare walls.''

FOLATE MAY HELP REDUCE HEART DISEASE FACTORS FOR OLDER WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   By DORIS CHANDLER   
 The Gainesville Sun   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ The benefits of folate for women of
childbearing age have been known for some time, but a new
University of Florida study is the first to document that this
vitamin reduces a risk factor in heart disease for postmenopausal
women ages 63 to 85.
</P>
<P>
   Previous research has shown that folate _ a B vitamin naturally
occurring in food _ and its synthetic version, folic acid, can help
prevent certain birth defects of the brain and spinal cord called
neural-tube defects. For women of childbearing age, the National
Institute of Medicine recommends daily consumption of 400
micrograms of folic acid, plus folate from a varied diet.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Florida study examined the effect of different
levels of folate on blood levels of homocysteine, an amino acid
that requires folate in order to metabolize. Previous studies of
homocysteine have suggested it is a risk factor for heart disease,
which is the No. 1 killer of men and postmenopausal women.
</P>
<P>
   The study was directed by Lynn Bailey, professor of human
nutrition, and Gail Kauwell, an associate professor of human
nutrition, both at the Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   In the 14-week study, 33 postmenopausal women received low
levels of folate _ 120 micrograms for seven weeks. In the last
seven weeks, women in the study consumed different levels of
folate, some received 200 micrograms, others 400 micrograms.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those receiving low levels of folate, homocysteine levels
increased,'' Bailey said. ``The ones on 400 micrograms had a
positive response. Blood folate levels increased, and blood levels
of homocysteine, an amino acid considered a risk factor in heart
disease, remained low.''
</P>
<P>
   Before this study, there was little information available on
folate's effects for older women, Kauwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bailey and Kauwell emphasized that study results indicate
that higher levels of folate may reduce only one of the risk
factors of heart disease, not the incidence of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we can say is that homocysteine is a risk factor in heart
disease, and that adequate intake of folate can reduce homocysteine
concentration,'' Kauwell said. ``We look at it as a way to help
reduce the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Results of the study are to be published in the June issue of
the Journal of Nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   Study participants received folate by eating a balanced diet,
with orange juice playing a prominent role. One 8-ounce glass
contains 75 micrograms of folate, Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Other major sources of folate are dark green, leafy vegetables;
other fruits, such as strawberries; kidney beans and peas; and
liver, although liver is high in cholesterol.

ERIC TURNER, 31, OAKLAND RAIDERS DEFENSIVE BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eric Turner, the Oakland Raiders defensive back who was a
two-time All-Pro during his nine seasons in the National Football
League, died Sunday at a hospital in Thousand Oaks, Calif. He was
31.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was apparently complications of abdominal cancer,
according to Craig Stevens, the medical examiner at the Ventura
County coroner's office.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Turner, a free safety, issued a statement denying
a published report that he was gravely ill. He declined to provide
details on his medical condition, saying, ``I realize people are
concerned, but I have chosen to keep this issue within my family.''
Turner had missed the Raiders' minicamp in April, but the team had
declined to comment on reports concerning his health.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, a native of Ventura, Calif., was selected by the
Cleveland Browns as the No. 2 choice over all in the 1991 draft,
behind Russell Maryland, the defensive lineman taken by the Dallas
Cowboys. When Turner arrived at the NFL scouting combine in
Indianapolis, several other defensive backs seemed ahead of him in
the eyes of pro scouts. But after he ran a 40-yard sprint in less
than 4.4 seconds, he vaulted to the No. 2 draft spot and received a
four-year contract worth $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Donahue, Turner's coach at UCLA and now the San Francisco
49ers' director of player personnel, said Turner was ``as good a
Bruin football player as there ever was.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner's 369 tackles were fourth on the career list when he
turned professional.
</P>
<P>
   Turner was selected to the Pro Bowl in 1994, when he tied for
the league lead in interceptions with nine, including a 93-yard
return for a touchdown against the Arizona Cardinals. He was
selected as the American Football Conference player of the month
for December. Turner was an All-Pro again in 1996, when he had five
interceptions, the most on his team, which had become the Baltimore
Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, a 6-foot-1-inch 210-pounder, signed a four-year contract
with the Raiders as a free agent before the 1997 season. He led
Oakland in tackles that year with 111 but played in only six games
in 1998 because of a foot injury and in 10 games in 1999 because of
a calf injury.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders signed the free-agent safeties Anthony Dorsett and
Je'Rod Cherry during the off-season, but renegotiated Turner's
contract in March, signing him through 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Turner is survived by a son, Eric Turner Jr. &QL;

IRISH GOVERNMENT MOVES TOWARD TOBACCO LITIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: The spelling ``Micheal'' in the 7th-last graf is correct.) 
 By BRIAN LAVERY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ With bipartisan political support and a
growing national awareness of public health issues, the Irish
government is taking aggressive steps that could result in Ireland
being the first European country to seek damages from tobacco
companies for the cost of treating smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Irish lawyers and members of Parliament traveled to
New Orleans to seek advice from veterans of the landmark U.S.
tobacco settlements, including Hubert H. Humphrey III, the former
attorney general for Minnesota, and Ron Motley, a leading
plaintiff's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   A parliamentary health committee will soon begin investigating
whether three Irish tobacco companies knew about research by their
U.S. parent companies into the dangers of smoking and the addictive
nature of nicotine.
</P>
<P>
   In a report published in November, the cross-party committee
recommended that the Irish government, the eight regional health
boards, the partially state-owned health insurance company, and the
country's private hospitals all should sue the tobacco companies
for damages.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is currently hearing legal advice before
requesting so-called powers of compellability _ the right to
subpoena documents and witnesses. But all the nation's political
parties have already approved such a move.
</P>
<P>
   Batt O'Keeffe, the chairman of the committee, said he wants to
make sure that tobacco companies will not be able to question the
legality of the investigation's findings, based on background
issues like the membership of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesperson for the Irish Tobacco Manufacturers' Advisory
Committee said that the industry had seen the committee's report
but would have no comment until a specific government proposal is
made by the Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
   While the government's case might not go to trial for several
years, 300 civil suits by individuals claiming personal injury
damages have already been filed and will reach the courts within a
year, plaintiff's lawyers say.
</P>
<P>
   Peter McDonnell, a lawyer representing 204 personal injury
claims against Irish tobacco companies, said that Ireland's small
size and relatively simple legal system offer a tremendous
advantage in litigation. Cases begun in Ireland's High Court can be
appealed only once, to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   And since tobacco companies here act principally as
distributors, the industry has no local lobbying power to create
opposition within the government, he argued. ``It's like pushing an
open door,'' McDonnell said.
</P>
<P>
   One of McDonnell's clients, Anne Moloney, had a lung removed in
1996, along with part of her heart lining, after being diagnosed
with lung cancer, she said. Moloney, now 47, started smoking at 13,
she said, claiming that she was unaware of any health risks until
1973. (Warnings on cigarette packages appeared in Ireland in 1978,
10 years after they appeared in the United States.)
</P>
<P>
   ``My doctor advised me to stop smoking, because I would have a
small baby,'' she said. ``It never dawned on me that it would cause
cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   The rate of smoking is still highest among teen-age girls, at 40
percent, according to the nonprofit group Action on Smoking and
Health. The smoking population dropped to a historic low of 28
percent six years ago, but has since risen to 32 percent. The
government attributes 6,500 deaths per year to smoking-related
causes, in a country of 4 million people.
</P>
<P>
   O'Keeffe estimates that the Irish government spends between $570
million and $1.15 billion per year on health care for
tobacco-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   McDonnell argues that the potential damages are much higher:
Based on the damages awarded to Minnesota, he says that Ireland is
eligible for a $23 billion settlement. Only two years ago, Brian
Cowen, then Ireland's health minister, said that the cost to the
government of treating tobacco-related illnesses was just $115
million Irish pounds.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Micheal Martin, the current health minister who took office in
January, has helped set the aggressive tone with his calls for
Ireland to become ``a tobacco-free society.'' Recently he proposed
legislation to raise the legal smoking age from 16 to 18 and
sharply restrict smoking in public.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes to push the bill through Parliament on a fast track to
approval before this summer. In advance of a deadline called for by
the European Union, he has promised to implement a complete ban on
tobacco advertising in July.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland's tobacco industry points out that a ban on print
advertising makes little sense, because British newspapers with
cigarette ads command significant space on newsstands here. ``It's
difficult to see the wisdom in Ireland moving ahead of the UK,''
the spokesperson said. ``The industry feels that the current packet
of regulation, along with the EU directive, is one of the strictest
in the world, and is very adequate.''
</P>
<P>
   Most smokers, of course, resent restrictions on their habit. But
the government's initiatives have not raised much protest. ``I
think Irish people are becoming more aware of their health, and
more assertive of their health rights,'' said Hugh Ward, a lawyer
who is representing 50 bartenders in lawsuits against their
employers. The bartenders claim that extended exposure to
secondhand smoke constitutes dangerous working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland's pub culture is where widespread acceptance of smoking
is more difficult to shake. For more than half of Ireland's
pub-goers, a pint glass in one hand is accompanied by a cigarette
in the other. Pubs that have attempted to curtail smoking quickly
reversed the policy after losing business, according to Dick Dunne,
president of the Vintners' Federation of Ireland, the national pub
owners trade association.
</P>
<P>
   ``A blanket ban on smoking would be detrimental to our
business,'' said Dunne, a third-generation pub owner. Such a ban
would be impossible to enforce at small pubs around the country, he
said. Instead, the federation wants the tobacco industry to
subsidize modern ventilation systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because something was taboo overnight doesn't mean we
were irresponsible,'' he said in defense of the pub owners. ``A lot
of pubs had machines for years, but they didn't work properly.''

TIME MAGAZINE SUGGESTS BUSH FAVORS DANFORTH AS RUNNING MATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A newsweekly's suggestion that George W. Bush
favors former Sen. Jack Danforth of Missouri as his running mate
has the state's Republicans struggling to keep their favorite-son
hopes in check.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would do great things for the ticket and go a long way to
delivering a key state,'' said John Hancock, executive director of
the Missouri Republican Party. ``(But) it's a little premature for
us to be getting too excited about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Time magazine reported over the Memorial Day weekend that
Danforth, 63, figures heavily in Bush's calculations about whom to
tap for the Republican vice presidential nomination. ``What name
does Bush return to in his private ruminations?'' the magazine
asked. ``Danforth.''
</P>
<P>
   At least on paper, Danforth fits several of Bush's needs.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth long has been firmly opposed to abortion and so would
appease a vocal wing of his own party. The rest of his politics
generally falls into a more moderate or free-thinking pattern that
could appeal to the political middle. He opposed
government-mandated school prayer and a constitutional amendment to
ban flag burning, and he backed most civil rights laws.
</P>
<P>
   He comes from a state with 11 electoral votes that has voted for
the winner in every presidential election since 1960.
</P>
<P>
   And Danforth enjoys a record built on 18 years in the Senate
with a reputation for independence and without serious scandal. It
landed him the job as special counsel to study whether federal
officials unnecessarily killed anyone _ or tried to cover up their
actions _ at the April 19, 1993, destruction of the Branch Davidian
compound in Waco, Texas. His report is expected before the fall
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who knows Jack Danforth knows that he is one of the
great purists in politics'' and is largely immune to partisan
pressure, said Larry Sabato, a political science professor at the
University of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth's reputation as a political moderate would win strong
reviews with the country's media elite, Sabato said, while his
pro-life record and shepherding of Clarence Thomas' 1991
confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court would serve him well among
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Sabato said, Danforth's low-key, almost modest style as
a public figure suits someone running as a supporting player.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would strengthen Bush,'' Sabato said, ``without outshining
him.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not Danforth's first dance with a presumptive Republican
presidential nominee. When the elder George Bush was looking for a
running mate in 1988, a Danforth associate said, the senator's
campaign responded to Bush's request for detailed records typically
asked only of the final three to five possible choices.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush chose, at some political expense, Dan Quayle, and
Danforth served six more years in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Since leaving Washington in early 1995, Danforth has worked
mostly in St. Louis. He is a partner in the Bryan Cave law firm and
sits on several corporate boards, including that of media giant
Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bush, Danforth comes from a wealthy family. He is an heir
to the Ralston Purina fortune.
</P>
<P>
   The two men also share personal connections. Danforth is close a
friend of William ``Bucky'' Bush, an uncle of the Texas governor
and St. Louis businessmen. In addition, one of George W. Bush's
chief advisors and fund raisers is Jack Oliver, who worked on
Danforth campaigns and was an intern in his Senate office.
</P>
<P>
   The Time article reads like a trial balloon for a Danforth
nomination, suggesting the Texas governor is smitten with the idea
of the former Missouri politician without making clear the source
of the story. Officially, the campaign would not humor any rumors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The details are being kept between Governor Bush and Dick
Cheney,'' spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said, referring to the former
defense secretary heading the Republican search for a vice
presidential candidate. ``The governor's looking at a lot of
different people.''

COMMENTARY: SURFING ALONE 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I just completed a book-related tour around the United States,
which left me feeling that a backlash may be brewing against all
the technology hype now dominating our lives. If 1998 was the year
of Internet hope, and 1999 the year of Internet hype, maybe 2000
will be the year of Internet reality. Here's my diary.
</P>
<P>
   Day 1: New York's 92nd Street Y. A young professional woman
introduces herself something like this: ``Hi, my name is ... and I
work for a dot.com that's running out of money and about to go out
of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Day 2: Dinner at the Motorola Museum in Chicago. The
conversation shifts to how sterile life can become when everything
gets done on networks. A Motorola exec tells this story: She called
her bank the other day to do some banking by phone. You know, press
a few buttons and move your money around. But this time when she
called her bank she got a real shock: a person answered.
</P>
<P>
   Yup, she said, a real live person. The bank's automated teller
system was broken so they had to resort to the human variety _
those that that run on chocolate chips, not microchips. The woman
described how much she savored the human interaction, and we all
nodded knowingly.
</P>
<P>
   Day 5: Minneapolis. I am visiting hometown friends, Ken and Jill
Greer, who own an ad agency that advertises its services on a Web
site, Thinkgreer.com. Under photographic services, the Greers
offered potential clients two choices of photography: ``Digital''
or ``Silver Halide.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People would call us,'' Ken recalled, ``and say, `I'm familiar
with digital photography, but what is this new silver halide? What
sort of technology is that?' You know, on the Internet everyone
wants to be the first to discover something new, and they assumed
that silver halide was this hot new technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Silver halide is just a fancy term for plain old film. But the
name is so high-techy sounding that some people assumed it was the
new, new thing, and they had to have it.
</P>
<P>
   Day 10: Las Vegas, the shopping center convention. My relatives
are in the mall business, where everyone is worried about all the
stories of the high-tech age, just around the corner, when you will
be able to do all your shopping online from your Palm Pilot, and
your refrigerator will automatically order more milk via the Web
when its high-tech sensors indicate you're low. I jokingly
suggested to the shopping center folks that they run an ad that
would say: ``Imagine a world in which you will be able to go to
just one place, walk from shop to shop, and see, touch, feel or try
on anything you like, and then buy it right there and take it home
with you _ without worrying about your credit card number being
stolen, or how UPS will deliver it, or how you will ship it back if
it doesn't fit. Imagine such a world! It's also just around the
corner _ right now. It's called a mall.''
</P>
<P>
   I believe in the possibilities of the new technologies as much
as anyone. But it seems that while we started by surfing the Web,
the Web is now surfing us. Technology is making life more
complicated, not less, and we haven't found the balance yet.
</P>
<P>
   American Express has been running a TV ad showing a teen-age
girl at the kitchen table with her dad. The girl is working on her
laptop and the father is paying bills by hand. The girl says to her
dad: ``You're so analog!'' So the father asks: ``Analog? Is that
good?'' The daughter says: ``Quaint.'' The father asks: ``Is quaint
good?'' The daughter says: ``Sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   More than sometimes. Walking through the casino in Las Vegas I
was struck by all the shouting around the craps tables _ strangers
high-fiving each other in victory and consoling each other in
defeat. You can't do that gambling online alone in your basement.
Las Vegas is thriving today precisely because it is such a tactile
place, so full of people rubbing against people _ at shows, in
casinos, in fantasy hotels and in giant swimming pools. Las Vegas
is the future because it's the past.
</P>
<P>
   Day 11: I call my wife. She teaches fifth grade in a public
school. She sounds tired. I ask what's new. She says she had to
call some parents to come into school for special parent-teacher
conferences before the school year ends. I think: Who is going to
do that when education moves online?
</P>
<P>
   I recall another ad I saw along the way for a global phone
company. It said: ``I phone, I fax, I surf at the same time _
because I can.''
</P>
<P>
   But who wants to?
</P>

AT MORE PARKS, SMOG IS OBSCURING THE VIEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., June 4) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As another smog season begins, it's likely that
some of the country's most popular national parks, especially in
the east, will once again be troubled by haze and smog rivaling the
levels in crowded metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
   A booming economy has been increasing production from factories
and power plants whose pollution blows on the wind to distant peaks
in national parks like Acadia in Maine, Shenandoah in Virginia and
Great Smoky Mountains in North Carolina and Tennessee. A hiker
following the length of the Appalachian Trail this summer,
therefore, is likely to encounter some pretty smoggy days.
</P>
<P>
   On March 8, monitors in Great Smoky Mountains Park, near the
southern end of the Appalachian Trail, recorded what the park's air
quality officials called extraordinarily early violations of
federal smog standards. Last autumn, the monitors documented heavy
smog unusually late in the year. Usually, the smog season is
concentrated in summer.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Great Smoky recorded 52 days of smog exceeding
federal health standards. Acadia recorded worse smog than Boston
and Philadelphia. Visibility from Shenandoah's heights has been
reduced by a quarter in the last 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   In a satirical essay in the April issue of Backpacker magazine,
Thom Hogan, the editor, writes of traveling the length of the
Appalachian Trail 50 years in the future _ starting in January in
Georgia to beat the heat and smog on a trip that nowadays typically
begins in March. ``Fortunately, I'm carrying my battery-powered
rebreather, a technology derived from scuba equipment and paid for
and refined by the final tobacco-industry settlements with the
federal government in 2003,'' he fantasizes.
</P>
<P>
   Park advocates say today's reality is grim enough. ``It's a
tragedy when the air is dirtier in the places we escape the
pollution of the city,'' said Jonathan Birdsong, southeastern
regional representative for the Izaac Walton League, a conservation
group of hunters and other outdors enthusiasts, which recently
issued a study of the trends.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency reported last month that in
recent years, the smog trend in some national parks has been
running counter to the overall national picture, which has steadily
improved. Smog concentrations increased at 17 of 24 National Park
Service monitoring sites from 1992 to 1998, the most recent
comprehensive data that is available, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The data measures ground-level concentrations of ozone, a
chemical that forms smog. Ozone damages living cells, and therefore
can harm not only growing plants but also people's lungs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1998 levels were particularly high at two parks in the
eastern United States, Shenandoah and the Great Smoky Mountains,''
the report said. ``Ozone levels at these sites were the highest in
a decade and 30 to 40 percent higher than the national ozone
standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Haze _ not the natural bluish vapors that gave the mountains
their name, but the suspended smoky particles that are chemically
different from smog _ is also worsening, the report said. ``Eastern
visibility impairment on the haziest days has worsened from 1997 to
1998, and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park experienced its
worst visibility in more than a decade.''
</P>
<P>
   More than the view is affected, park advocates say. In a study
several years ago by the Appalachian Mountain Club, Brigham and
Women's Hospital in Boston and the Harvard School of Public Health,
hikers climbing to the summit of Mount Washington in New Hampshire
suffered from less efficient breathing as ozone levels rose. The
people who had the worst problems were those with a history of
asthma or other lung problems, but even healthy climbers could be
afdfected, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers in the Great Smoky Mountains park have documented
damage to 30 plant species, including tall milkweed, black cherry
and sassafras.
</P>
<P>
   There are many sources of air pollution in parks. Some are
affected even in wintertime by heavy snowmobile use; Yellowstone
National Park is phasing out snowmobiles, and other parks are
expected to crack down on their use. Cars, of course, crowd many
parks in summer.
</P>
<P>
   But the most persistent problems are caused by industrial
pollution from relatively distant sources, especially coal-fired
power plants, according to pollution experts.
</P>
<P>
   In Great Smoky, for example, air quality scientists have found
strong correlations between emissions from the Tennessee Valley
Authority's power plants and pollution in the park. The National
Oceanographic and Atmospheric Agency, which has been flying
research planes in the area, said pollution patterns are complex
and implicated Ohio Valley plants as well.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA has adopted policies that should result in significant
reductions in smog in eastern states, including emissions from the
TVA, in the next several years. The power authority already has
taken steps to reduce the generation of smog-creating chemicals,
especially in the summer. But at the same time, the authority,
which is the largest federal utility in the nation, has been
challenging some of the environmental agency's rules in court.

CANDIDATES STEER CLEAR OF POLITICS IN HONORING THE COUNTRY'S WAR
DEAD 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Pa.)   By JAMES DAO with FRANK BRUNI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELIZABETH, Pa. _ Vice President Al Gore commemorated the
nation's war dead Monday by recounting his own military experiences
in Vietnam and the complex web of emotions, from patriotism to
family devotion to guilt, that caused him to enlist three decades
ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech before several hundred people gathered for a
Memorial Day ceremony here, Gore acknowledged that his five months
in Vietnam as an Army reporter were not the most grueling or
dangerous, saying, ``I know that my service doesn't in any way
match that of the heroes we honor on this day.''
</P>
<P>
   But his time in uniform and near the battlefield had taught him
much about sacrifice, honor and loyalty among soldiers, Gore said
in a speech largely devoid of policy, politics and mention of his
Republican rival for the presidency, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those veterans who are here, whether you served in Vietnam or
Korea, the Persian Gulf or World War II or another conflict, you
have that bond with those you served with,'' he said in this small
town along the Monongahela River, just south of Pittsburgh. ``You
felt the same feelings. You saw the same things. You made the same
sacrifices.''
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, Bush, who was a pilot in the Texas Air National Guard,
delivered brief remarks that were less personal than Gore's, but
that also steered clear of politics and the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do we owe the brave?'' he asked several hundred veterans,
local residents and Army men and women outside the community center
in Killeen, where the Army's Fort Hood is located. ``It is our
first duty to honor what they have done, and that should not be
hard, because it is one of the greatest stories of human history.''
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, Monday's deeply personal speech fits into a broader
effort by his campaign to reintroduce him to voters through
television commercials, speeches and other events that highlight
his biography. Later this week, he is scheduled to promote cancer
programs by discussing the death of his sister, Nancy, from lung
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Nestled in a valley of rolling hills and shuttered steel mills,
Elizabeth provided an ideal locale for Gore's speech. The region
not only has large numbers of war veterans, but also union members
and conservative Democrats whose support is seen as vital to Gore's
chances of winning Pennsylvania's 23 electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore enlisted in the Army two months after graduating from
Harvard in 1969, even though he opposed the war in Vietnam. Friends
have said he signed up in part to protect his father, Sen. Albert
Gore of Tennessee, from criticism by Republican supporters of the
war. The elder Gore, a vocal opponent of America's involvement in
Vietnam, was running for re-election at the time.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday Gore offered another reason for enlisting, suggesting
that he could not have faced the guilt of knowing that other young
men from his hometown might have gone to their deaths in his place.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to Vietnam, I had many misgivings,'' he said.
``But my draft board was in Carthage, Tennessee, and that made a
big difference because, you know, if you found some way not to go,
you would know the person who went in your place. That person would
have a place and a name and a family and a face.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said little about his time in Vietnam. But he described
feeling disillusioned upon returning to a nation that was
ambivalent, and sometimes hostile, toward its Vietnam veterans.
That disillusionment, he claimed, kept him from running for public
office for several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you remember that parade that was waiting for us?'' he said
about his homecoming. ``One of the reasons Vietnam veterans always
say welcome home to one another was, of course, there wasn't a
parade.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has spent much of this month on the campaign trail
trying to bolster his foreign-policy credentials with proposals
related to national defense and remarks on international affairs,
made only the slightest detour in that direction Monday, calling
anew for the development of a national missile defense. Both Gore
and Defense Secretary William Cohen have recently questioned the
prudence of pushing too aggressively for such a system.
</P>
<P>
   Bush reiterated his own position, placing in the context of a
general plea for strengthening the country's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who man the lighthouse of freedom ask little of our
nation in return,'' Bush said. ``But what they ask, our nation must
provide: a military of high morale, a military that's well paid and
well housed, a military well prepared and well equipped, a military
respected by those in authority, a military that's got a coherent
vision of America's duties _ a clear military mission in a time of
crisis _ and a modern defense system aimed to protect our homeland
and to protect our allies.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Gore said his time living in a trailer park with his
wife, Tipper, during basic training had taught him about the need
to improve the pay, benefits and housing of active-duty military
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   And both men said that while it was important to pay tribute to
war service with monuments and medals, it was even more important
to share the details of those sacrifices with young Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must pass stories of American courage and character to the
next generation, to capture their imaginations, to raise a monument
in their hearts,'' Bush said. ``This is the way our democracy
renews its promise: by celebrating American heroes and American
values without hesitation and without apology.''
</P>
<P>
   Quoting President John F. Kennedy, Gore said: ``Democracy is a
call to untiring effort, to continual sacrifice, and to the
willingness, if necessary, to die in its defense.''

SAMUEL TAYLOR, 87, PLAYWRIGHT WHO CREATED `SABRINA' 
</HEADLINE>
   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Samuel Taylor, who wrote Broadway confections like ``Sabrina
Fair'' and ``The Pleasure of His Company'' and worked on the script
for the Hitchcock thriller ``Vertigo,'' died on Friday at his home
in Blue Hill, Maine. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Favoring the genre in which Philip Barry famously tweaked the
rich and charming, as in ``The Philadelphia Story,'' Taylor did his
own skewering in ``Sabrina Fair,'' which opened on Broadway in
1953.
</P>
<P>
   The now-familiar fable introduced the genteel and enormously
rich Larrabee brothers of Long Island; their chauffeur, Fairchild;
and his daughter, Sabrina. It starred Joseph Cotten and Scott
McKay, with Margaret Sullavan cast as the brilliant, Paris-educated
Sabrina.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times deemed it beguiling, and
called it an ``unpretentious comedy with genuine quality in the
writing and acting,'' adding that the cast was heavenly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Taylor does not try to conquer the audience,'' Atkinson
concluded. ``He wins it by writing with taste and good humour about
agreeable people.''
</P>
<P>
   Atkinson found the play's subtle stylishness much different from
Taylor's Broadway debut in 1950 with an adaptation of the Robert
Fontaine novel ``The Happy Time,'' about the foibles of a
French-Canadian family in the 1920s. That play, Atkinson wrote, was
an ``entertaining prank,'' whose humors ``were broad and bawdy.''
</P>
<P>
   The film director Billy Wilder, with Taylor and Ernest Lehman as
co-writers, enchanted movie audiences in 1954 with ``Sabrina,''
starring a heartbreaking Audrey Hepburn, with Humphrey Bogart and
William Holden as the Larrabees. Sydney Pollack, in turn used the
Wilder-Taylor-Lehman material for his own run on ``Sabrina,''
starring Harrison Ford, Greg Kinnear and Julia Ormond, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's ``Pleasure of His Company,'' written with and starring
Cornelia Otis Skinner, opened in 1958, with Cyril Ritchard, the
Dolores Hart and George Peppard sharing the stage. ``Throughly
delightful,'' Atkinson wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comedy of manners is not obsolete after all,'' he said. `
``The Pleasure of His Company' gives pleasure on both sides of the
footlights.''
</P>
<P>
   While working on the play, Taylor was enlisted by Hitchcock to
mend the script of ``Vertigo,'' which had already gone through two
writers. Taylor made substantial changes, added characters and
dashes of San Francisco color and decided to let the audience in on
the film's secret well ahead of the fadeout.
</P>
<P>
   The film premiered in 1958. A restored version was released in
1996, and two years later the American Film Institute listed it as
one of 100 best American movies. Although Taylor considered himself
a playwright first and foremost, his film credits also included
another Hitchcock film, ``Topaz,'' as well as ``The Eddy Duchin
Story,'' ``Goodbye Again'' and ``Rosie.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Chicago, Samuel Albert Taylor attended the University of
California at Berkeley in the early 1930s, with interruptions to
serve as a merchant seaman. In the mid-30s he set out for New York
and a writing career.
</P>
<P>
   He soon became enamored of the theater and found work as a play
doctor and rewriter, for which he received no writing credit. He
worked on the Clifford Goldsmith play ``What a Life'' and wrote
radio sripts for ``The Aldrich Family,'' the series based on it.

<P>
   While holding on to his day job in radio, he spent several years
completing ``The Happy Time.'' Its success enabled him to give up
radio comedies for good.
</P>
<P>
   He strayed into musicals once, writing the book for the 1962
play ``No Strings,'' with music and lyrics by Richard Rodgers. It
was the story of a white expatriate writer in Paris (Richard
Kiley), who falls in love with a black model (Diahann Carroll). It
played on Broadway for more than a year, but plans for a movie
version fell through because the producers foresaw trouble from
Southern distributors.

<P>
   Taylor's other plays included ``Beekman Place'' (1964),
``Avanti!'' (1968), ``A Touch of Spring'' (1975), ``Flying Colors''
(1985), and ``Three by Three'' (1988).
</P>
<P>
   Taylor is survived by his wife of 60 years, Suzanne Combes
Taylor; two sons, David, of Brookline, Mass., and Michael, of
Berkeley, Calif.; a step-daughter, Ellinor Mitchell of New York
City; and nine grandchildren.

ANALYSIS: IN PERU, THE ISSUE IS STABILITY VS. DEMOCRACY 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD KRAUSs   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ The students have been back in the streets,
throwing Molotov cocktails at the presidential palace, and the
police have been firing back, with tear gas and water cannon. A
journalist was tortured last week after he said he had evidence
that the intelligence chief was conspiring with election officials.
The army called for order.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface it appeared so familiar, as President Alberto
Fujimori rode to a third term on Sunday in an election so full of
dirty tricks that Alejandro Toledo, the opposition candidate,
withdrew from the race, and all the international election monitors
backed off, too, before a single vote was cast.
</P>
<P>
   But this battle actually has a different script. Issues that
were important in Peru before the end of Communism are not the
issues any longer, and the same is true around the region.
</P>
<P>
   The old issues of land, class conflict and resistance to
imperialism that were foremost during the waves of guerrilla
insurrections, university revolts and military coups in Peru from
the 1960s through the early 1990s are no longer setting the sparks.
</P>
<P>
   The new dominant issue facing Peruvians is about whether the
nation is best served by politicians who put democracy first, or
those who put stability first. It is a question that was not
resolved on Sunday, because the election was effectively not
contested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, the issue was survival,'' said Francisco Diez Canseco,
a former congressman and human rights activist. ``Now it's about
whether the virtues of authoritarianism are to be replaced by the
growing desire of people for broader political participation.''
</P>
<P>
   The question crosses class and ideological boundaries. It raises
uncomfortable choices for a country whose few experiments in
democracy have brought corruption, inefficiency, instability and
economic chaos.
</P>
<P>
   And U.S. policymakers also find themselves in a quandary,
wanting to encourage free elections but also wanting to support a
government that has been a strong ally against terrorism and drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   The cast of characters and alliances would have seemed
impossible in the days before Communism's collapse, when the
political currents flowing across Latin America originated in
Washington, Moscow and Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Take Toledo, whose resume and platform would have been
unthinkable just a few years ago for someone proposing to annul an
election and overthrow a government.
</P>
<P>
   Though he comes from a poor family, Toledo is a former World
Bank employee and business school professor, has a doctorate from
Stanford, and is not too proud to admit that he likes to eat at
McDonald's. He says his first project, if he ever made it to the
presidential palace, would be to create an independent, uncorrupt
judiciary. His core constituency is the urban middle class.
</P>
<P>
   For Toledo, the choice for Peru now is between ``democracy and
dictatorship.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, moderates like him usually found themselves facing
a Hobson's choice between the right and the left, and they usually
lost out in coalitions with either Marxist guerrillas or right-wing
generals. Today in Peru, the moderates are leading the revolution
and the leftists are following.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy is dignity, it makes us creative and productive,''
Toledo told a throng of more than 60,000 dominated by university
students who gathered in Lima on Sunday night. ``When there is
dictatorship, there is no investment.'' Standing beside Toledo _ in
a gesture a previous generation of students would have thought
impossible to stomach _ was Francisco Morales Bermudez, a retired
general and the nation's last military president, who ushered in
civilian rule in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Standing between this rather unrevolutionary lot and power is
Fujimori. The son of Japanese immigrants, Fujimori remains in many
ways the ultimate outsider even after his 10 years in power. He
continues to be the target of nasty racial jokes by the Lima
elites, and he is proud that his core constituency entails the
urban shantytown dwellers and Indian villagers in regions most
severely attacked by Maoist terrorists in the 1980s and early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori has a long list of accomplishments, ranging from the
defeat of two terrorist groups and hyperinflation to making peace
with Ecuador after more than a century of border strife. He has
probably built more schools, roads and health clinics to serve the
poor than every other Peruvian president combined.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with Fujimori, according to his critics, is he fires
judges when they disagree with him, he uses his intelligence agency
to harass his opponents, he finds ways to put his cronies in charge
of television stations, and he is willing to convict suspected
terrorists without giving their lawyers the benefit of
cross-examination. In short, he does not give democratic rules a
very high priority.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Fujimori said his muscular tactics
may not be pretty but they are necessary. ``In emergency
situations,'' he said, ``I had to take emergency measures that may
have appeared anti-democratic.'' He promised that once he is
inaugurated on July 28, ``there will be certain corrections.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Fujimori temporarily disbanded the Congress and Supreme
Court, saying he needed more powers to defeat the terrorists and
narcotics traffickers. The traditional political parties that
controlled those institutions, he argued, only stood in the way.
Washington and the Latin American democracies were highly critical,
but the Peruvian people went along enthusiastically, and Fujimori
won a re-election landslide in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls suggest that the Peruvian president might well
have won a clean, uncontested election this year again, although by
a much narrower margin. With Peru no longer in crisis, a growing
number of voters appeared ready to give democracy a chance again.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, historians will probably judge Fujimori's rule
positively or negatively depending on whether he leaves Peru in
better or worse shape for an eventual transition to democratic
rule.
</P>
<P>
   What Toledo and Fujimori have in common is their blurring of
ideological distinctions. What does it mean to be conservative or
progressive in Peru anymore when the two candidates _ who otherwise
seem to be at war with each other _ essentially share the same
economic and social goals?
</P>
<P>
   It is much the same in Mexico, where some left-leaning activists
are backing the conservative presidential candidate as the best way
to crack the dominance of a ruling party that has been in power for
more than seven decades. Or in Chile, where the first Socialist
president in a generation has embraced the heart of the free-market
economic policies first put in place by the Pinochet dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Or in Bolivia, where a former military dictator now rules as a
democratically elected president in alliance with former
guerrillas. Or even in Colombia, where guerrillas with Marxist
origins recently took to exchanging views with visiting investors
from Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Political turbulence continues to roil much of the region. But
only the whiff of tear gas remains the same.

FAMILY'S FOUNDATION CALLS ATTENTION TO NEED FOR BLACK BONE MARROW
DONORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERICA WOOD  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Sitting at the kitchen table one day, Walter
Chism turned to his 5-year-old granddaughter, her cheeks bloated
from medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could take this from you,'' Chism told the girl, who
had been diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Papa, you know you can't do that. This is my sickness,'' Bria
Chism said. ``I'll have a story to tell when I get better.''
</P>
<P>
   But she would not get better without a bone marrow transplant.
And Bria was African-American, so her odds were not good.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally a bone marrow donor's six key tissue-typing proteins
match the patient's. A match is more likely when both are from the
same ethnic group, but minorities are underrepresented on bone
marrow donor registries. And genetically it is harder to find
matches for black people than for white people.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Eighty percent of white bone marrow transplant
candidates find a match, according to the Heart of America Bone
Marrow Donor Registry, while only 50 percent of Hispanic candidates
and 20 percent of black candidates do.
</P>
<P>
   Within a month doctors did find a donor for Bria, but they had
to go outside the United States to find a woman who matched five of
Bria's six proteins.
</P>
<P>
   Bria's body rejected the new marrow. Her bladder, kidneys, lungs
and liver malfunctioned. Blood seeped into Bria's lungs, and the
doctors deemed the situation hopeless.
</P>
<P>
   The family hoped and prayed, said Bria's mother, Ayana Chism.
After two operations the little girl got better and the color
returned to her skin.
</P>
<P>
   Then she developed the fungal infection doctors had warned about
early on. The kindergartner was so weak, little could be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to let her leave with dignity,'' Walter Chism said.
``We decided to not let her suffer any longer and (to) unplug
her.''
</P>
<P>
   She died July 2, 1999, in her grandfather's arms.
</P>
<P>
   Bria's death motivated the Raytown, Mo., family to start the
Bria T. Chism Foundation, an organization dedicated to boosting the
low numbers of minority bone marrow donors and to easing the
financial burden of serious illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   On March 25 the foundation registered 33 new donors in its first
minority bone marrow drive. The ultimate goal is a nationwide
drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could find a way to make it easier for other people to
go through this thing, her death would not be in vain,'' Walter
Chism said.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Ng, spokeswoman for the National Marrow Donor Program, in
Minneapolis, said black people were at a disadvantage partly
because they donated at lower rates than white people did. Their
genetic makeup also makes it harder to find a match.
</P>
<P>
   Ng explained that antigens, the molecule or protein markers on
the white blood cells, are used to find a bone marrow match. She
said whites had more antigens in common with each other than blacks
had in common with each other, which made it easier for whites to
find a matching donor.
</P>
<P>
   The bone marrow program understands this, Ng said, so it
launched recruitment initiatives aimed at African-Americans,
Hispanics and other minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   She credited the initiatives with helping to triple the number
of minority transplants facilitated by her agency since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to raise awareness and education in these
communities,'' Ng said. ``You know what? This could be your father
(who needs a transplant).''
</P>
<P>
   In a bone marrow drive, a blood sample is taken from each
potential donor. Participants may be called to donate marrow later.
Bone marrow is collected from the donor through the hip bone.
</P>
<P>
   Why the shortage of potential minority donors?
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Woods, chief of pediatric hematology-oncology at
Children's Mercy Hospital, said some African-Americans were fearful
of the government and the medical establishment because of
incidents such as the Tuskegee experiment.
</P>
<P>
   In that 1932 experiment, the U.S. government lured 399 blacks to
Macon County, Ala., with the promise of free health care for their
syphilis. But the government withheld treatment for 40 years,
monitoring the participants as some died of the treatable disease.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, an African-American, said the number of minority donors
had risen, thanks to well-publicized cases like that of baseball
player Rod Carew. Carew's daughter, Michelle Carew, died of
leukemia four years ago while waiting for a donor.
</P>
<P>
   Woods suggests organizations focus on churches, fraternities and
sororities if they want to boost minority representation on the
donor registry.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're discussing the possibility of a transplant, you
worry if they'll ever find a donor,'' Woods said. ``And you worry
more with a minority family.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's bone marrow drive was coordinated through the
Heart of America Bone Marrow Registry, which receives a federal
grant that allows the agency to waive the $65 donation fee for
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the Bria T. Chism Foundation has raised $1,200,
most of it in a ``Celebration of Love'' at a Raytown YMCA on April
1, Bria's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The family treated the event like a birthday party, but the 50
to 60 guests brought monetary donations instead of gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Bria's grandmother, LaGail Chism, said family members hoped to
spare other families what they experienced.
</P>
<P>
   LaGail and Bria's mother remember her as a spirited little girl,
though that all changed as her sickness progressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching her turn into an old lady _ it was heartbreaking,''
LaGail Chism said.
</P>
<P>
   Donations for the Bria T. Chism Foundation can be sent to P.O.
Box. 18521, Raytown, MO 64133-8521. For information call (816)
353-5934.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Recently a group of schoolchildren in Harlem heard
the soprano Leontyne Price do something she had not done for over
two years: sing in public. She had gone to PAL, the Police Athletic
League building, a gleaming modern structure for after-school
activities at Manhattan Avenue and 119th Street, to read a book she
has written to about 30 fourth and fifth graders from Public School
180. Recently published by Gulliver Books of Harcourt Brace, the
book is a children's version of the opera Price was most identified
with during her illustrious career, Verdi's ``Aida.''
</P>
<P>
   After the reading, which took place in a small classroom, Price
met with some 300 elementary and middle school students from the
neighborhood to talk about her life and take questions. The
assembly was in a big gymnasium with the students seated on the
floor. Price, 73 and as striking as ever, her black dress adorned
with a colorful cape and matching turban, stood on a stage. Looking
out at the eager youngsters, she was visibly moved.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no idea how much it means to me to stare the world's
future in the face,'' she told them. ``To see your beautiful eyes,
your beautiful skin, your beautiful hearts _ it warms my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Touched, she started to sing, without accompaniment, ``This
Little Light of Mine,'' her ``mother's favorite spiritual,'' as she
used to describe it in recitals.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview later that day, she admitted ``never being more
nervous'' than when she saw the anticipation on the faces of her
young listeners. ``I didn't know whether the word `opera singer'
would intimidate them,'' she said. ``But I didn't want to be
condescending either. Kids can always detect that.''
</P>
<P>
   When she began singing, some of the boys and girls initially
reacted with grimaces and squelched laughs. To many children
everywhere, the sound of an operatic soprano's voice must seem
weirdly loud and strange. But most of the youngsters listened agog.
Even those pretending to cover their ears seemed stunned. When
Price ended her performance of the tender spiritual with a gleaming
high note that sopranos 40 years her junior would covet, the
children cheered, applauded and asked for more. She eventually
complied, with a grandly moving solo of ``America the Beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been 15 years since Price retired from the opera stage by
singing ``Aida'' at the Metropolitan Opera, a historic performance
broadcast live on television. At the time most critics felt that
she was still in impressive vocal condition. ``I was sensitive
enough to leave my era and not have it leave me,'' she said during
the interview. For the next dozen years Price sang recitals, though
with decreasing frequency. Finally, without drawing attention to
herself, she gave her last public recital in Chapel Hill, N.C., two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now she has the time to do things like visit Harlem from her
Greenwich Village town house to see schoolchildren and read her
``Aida'' book, colorfully illustrated by Leo and Diane Dillon. She
was approached with the idea of writing it by her longtime record
company, RCA Red Seal, which has released a compact disc of her
reading the story, interspersed with excerpts from her acclaimed
1970 recording of the opera. Record company executives accompanied
her on this visit to the PAL building. So the event, of course, had
a promotional aspect to it.
</P>
<P>
   But not to the children, who had been told by their teachers who
Leontyne Price is and what she represents to black Americans.
However much they knew of her life and work, the young students
seemed to respond to her aura, as if some amazing African-American
queen mother had come to them.
</P>
<P>
   At the reading, the fourth and fifth graders listened restlessly
at first but soon became absorbed by Price's compelling account of
an Ethiopian princess who is captured and enslaved by her Egyptian
enemies yet falls in love with Radames, the Egyptian military hero,
who at first does not know her true identity. When Price finished,
the young people sensed that, for all her grandeur, she was no
unapproachable diva. They gathered around her to ask for
autographs, mug for photographers and exchange hugs and kisses with
the special visitor.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Price, who will also take her reading to grade schools in
Chicago and other cities, has a natural empathy for children from
underprivileged backgrounds. She was born in Laurel, Miss., to a
father who worked in a sawmill and a mother who was a midwife. They
must have been remarkable parents, considering the accomplishments
of their two children: Price and her younger brother, George, who
became a brigadier general in the army and who was with her on this
day. Since his retirement, General Price, who lives in Washington
and is a tall, hardy man with a deep, robust speaking voice, has
been his sister's personal manager.
</P>
<P>
   As a young woman, Price was encouraged by her church choir
director to pursue a career in music. Wanting to be sensible,
though, she enrolled at Central State College in Wilberforce, Ohio,
and graduated with a degree in music education. But as her teachers
made clear, hers was not a ``teaching talent,'' Price said. So she
decided to audition for Juilliard. One of the judges was Florence
Page Kimball, who became her devoted teacher. ``She told me that
she thought that my voice was a brook that might be Niagara Falls
some day,'' Price recalled.
</P>
<P>
   But that was her first trip to New York. Was it intimidating?
``Are you serious?'' she said. ``I had heard about the Empire State
Building. So the day after the audition I took a double-decker bus
and went there, went to the top. It was the most frightening
experience of my life. I looked over and said to myself: `You can't
even see the size of the cars down there. You're out of your mind!
You're not going to survive a night in this town.' But then I
thought, `I'm going to conquer this place.' Still, I called my
mother and daddy and told them, `Be prepared; I may be overwhelmed
by this city.'''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, her first great triumphs came in San Francisco and
Chicago and Europe. But by 1961, with her Met debut in ``Il
Trovatore,'' she finally conquered New York as well.
</P>
<P>
   At the assembly Price was introduced by her brother. After
greeting the youngsters and singing, she stood onstage and invited
them to ask her anything they wanted to. As the students raised
their hands and walked one by one up to a microphone in front of
the stage, Price offered motherly encouragements like, ``Come here,
angel, talk to me.'' Some of the children instinctively felt that
this grand lady was someone they could confide in, for many of
their questions were revealing and poignant.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, there were several inquiries about fame. One
young man asked, ``How do you become famous?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You earn it,'' Price said. ``I am still earning it right now
with you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you keep your beautiful voice so perfect?'' one small
girl asked.
</P>
<P>
   Price beamed. ``I love you, dear,'' she said, adding, ``You do
it by constant work and constant vocalizing.''
</P>
<P>
   One student asked, ``How does it feel to be an opera singer?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel as close to God as I can be,'' Price answered.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why she became an opera singer, Price said that one
day when she was a young girl her mother took her to Jackson,
Miss., by bus for a voice recital by ``this beautiful, graceful
lady'' who was a ``great concert singer.'' It was Marian Anderson.
``I decided right then I wanted to be her,'' Price said.
</P>
<P>
   Several children who had been at the reading asked about
``Aida.'' One wondered simply why Aida was her favorite role.
``When I sang Aida,'' Price answered, ``I used the most important
plus that I have. You have it; I have it: this beautiful skin. When
I sang Aida, my skin was my costume.''
</P>
<P>
   Another youngster had clearly been struck by the sad ending of
the story: when Radames is condemned as a traitor and buried alive
in a stone tomb, he discovers that Aida, who had escaped, has
hidden herself there as well. ``If you could change the story,''
the boy asked, ``what would happen?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a very interesting question,'' Price said.
</P>
<P>
   She spoke of how important duty had always been to her, then
said: ``I think when Aida was in bondage, she maybe would have
fought harder against her strong feelings for Radames and for her
feelings for her family and her country, so she might have returned
home and fulfilled her responsibilities as a leader of her
people.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point Price told the children to appreciate that being
born an American is ``the most incredible thing to have happened to
you,'' a statement that carried special resonance coming from a
woman who attended segregated schools in the Deep South.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what she did as a child in Mississippi, Price talked about
playing hopscotch and dancing around a maypole with streamers made
of fabric strips left over from her mother's quilting. Later in
high school she loved being a drum majorette. Asked how her parents
felt about her wanting to be an opera singer, Price answered,
``They loved it and they loved me.''
</P>
<P>
   Then an awkward young girl timidly approached the microphone and
asked in a soft voice, ``Was it difficult for you growing up?''
</P>
<P>
   Price, quite touched, said, ``Well, sweetheart, let me turn the
question around. Is it difficult for you growing up?''
</P>
<P>
   The girl nodded her head and said, ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Price inquired further. Was it problems with friends, school,
homework, family, things like that? The girl nodded yes again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angel,'' Price said, ``what I can tell you is that it does get
better. All the things you think are negative now will change. I
promise you; I promise you.''
</P>
<P>
   The assembly ended when an adorably sassy young girl, signaled
by a teacher, headed straight up to the microphone and rather than
asking a question, thanked Price for coming and declared her to be
a ``really beautiful `go girl.'''
</P>
<P>
   Price roared with laughter and gratitude, started gyrating on
stage, dancing and waving her arms _ proving to these Harlem
youngsters that she has rhythm as well as soul.

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Under intense public pressure to get tough,
the Indonesian government placed former President Suharto under
house arrest Monday as it sought to bring him to trial for
corruption and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto, 78, has been debilitated by three strokes and is
apparently able to communicate _ sometimes incoherently _ only in
his native Javanese language. He has managed, with the help of his
lawyers, to complicate repeated attempts by investigators to
question him in his home.
</P>
<P>
   The house arrest, which does not materially change Suharto's
living conditions, was instituted ``to smooth the investigation and
in order to finish the case as scheduled,'' said Yushar Yahya, a
spokesman for Attorney General Marzuki Darusman.
</P>
<P>
   During a round of questioning at his home Monday morning,
Suharto personally signed an acknowledgment of the order placing
him under house arrest, although people who were there said he
seemed halting, forgetful and confused.
</P>
<P>
   During the three-hour session, Suharto ``had difficulty grasping
the questions because they were too long,'' said his lawyer, Juan
Felix Tampubolon. ``He haltingly tried to answer the questions, but
what came out was different. There were a lot of things he could
not remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's move came almost exactly two years after Suharto, the
all-powerful president for 32 years, stepped down _ on May 21, 1998
_ in the face of riots and student protests and under pressure from
defecting government ministers and even from his most loyal
military leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The two-week house arrest order, renewable in 30-day increments,
carried a powerful symbolism in a nation that is struggling,
sometimes chaotically, to convert itself from Suharto's iron-fisted
rule to an open democratic system.
</P>
<P>
   The order responds to an overwhelming public desire for
accountability that has shown itself most forcefully in frequent,
sometimes violent student demonstrations. These have taken place in
the dappled streets outside Suharto's home in a quiet neighborhood
of central Jakarta, where he lived throughout his presidency and
retreated in calm retirement two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It is also part of a broad government program to investigate and
potentially mete out punishment for a broad array of abuses ranging
as far back as the massacres of hundreds of thousands of people
during an anti-communist purge in 1965 and 1966, when Suharto
seized power.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto is accused of abusing his power in issuing presidential
decrees that he used to enrich himself, his six children and his
cronies and supporters. The case focuses particularly on seven
charitable trusts that Suharto fed by mandating donations from the
national budget.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general has said he expects the investigation to be
completed and any charges brought by Aug. 10. At that time,
President Abdurrahman Wahid must present the legislature with an
annual state-of the nation address.
</P>
<P>
   But much of Suharto's wealth, estimated in the billions or even
tens of billions of dollars, has so far been difficult to trace.
Like the so-called ``hidden wealth'' of former President Ferdinand
E. Marcos of the Philippines, who was forced from office in 1986,
it may never be recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many ways of laundering money,'' a diplomat said.
``This was a very methodical man.''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Separate investigations have been opened against some of the
Suharto children, who continue to control large portions of the
Indonesian economy. The man known as Suharto's ``first friend,''
Bob Hasan, is also under investigation for corruption.
</P>
<P>
   These investigations, although seemingly slow and politically
difficult, are one of the clearest signs that Wahid's
administration represents a clear break with the past.
</P>
<P>
   His predecessor, B.J. Habibie, an acolyte of Suharto's who held
office for 17 months, tiptoed around the corruption issue and
formally dropped an investigation as one of his last and most
unpopular acts, just before being voted out of office in October.
</P>
<P>
   Days later, Marzuki, the new attorney general, reopened the
case, and in February Suharto was formally named a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   But, treading a delicate political line, Wahid has said he would
pardon Suharto if he is convicted, provided that he returns his
stolen wealth to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Though sick, disgraced and out of sight, Suharto remains one of
the dominant personalities in Indonesia. Until two years ago he was
the only president 65 percent of the population had ever known. The
nation's currency still carries his portrait.
</P>
<P>
   And although Suharto is out of power, his shadow still casts a
chill among many Indonesians. Many see his hand _ or the hand of
his disenfranchised supporters _ behind a continuing series of
destabilizing violent incidents around the country.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two days, at least four bombs have hit Christian
churches in the Sumatran city of Medan in this largely Muslim
nation of 210 million people. More than 60 people were reported
injured.
</P>
<P>
   Other violence that has been fomented or aggravated by outsiders
continued in the far eastern Spice Islands and in the north
Sumatran province of Aceh. In Jakarta during the weekend, student
protesters demanding a trial for Suharto turned violent, and many
analysts and officials said they believed that the violence was
instigated by paid agitators.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you talk of burning cars and vandalism and so on, that's
not done by students,'' said Mulya Lubis, who heads a
nongovernmental group that fights corruption. ``That's done by
people who want to provoke chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Juwono Sudarsono said: ``There are a lot of
people disgruntled with government, including former Cabinet
members, both civilian and military. They have too much money and
nothing to do and they want to frustrate the Gus Dur,'' the
nickname of Wahid.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's order for house arrest will allow investigators to
question the former president every day if they choose to, Yahya
said. He added without elaborating that it would also ``prevent him
from destroying evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Tampubolon objected, saying the house arrest order ``deviated
from the proper procedure, so we feel that it is a baseless
decision. There is no legal basis for such a move. Security is in
the hands of the police, not the attorney general.''
</P>
<P>
   The order was something of a retreat for the attorney general,
who had said he planned to move Suharto into government custody
elsewhere. That suggestion received opposition even from within the
Cabinet, where some members called it excessively harsh and warned
of the fragility of the former president's health.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a hard line, Marzuki warned on Friday that the large
deployment of police officers that has held protesters at bay in
front of Suharto's house would be withdrawn if he did not offer
more cooperation to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear, though, how Monday's formal detention order
would affect the course of the questioning, which apparently
proceeded as best it could earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The target has been met, meaning that all the questions have
been answered,'' said Dr. Supardi Sudibyo, head of the
state-appointed medical team for Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   Tampubolon had tried to cut short the session, complaining that
Suharto's blood pressure soared when he was questioned about the
charitable foundations. But Sudibyo said the former president's
blood pressure ``normally goes up after a questioning session.''
</P>
<P>
   And although Suharto is out of power, his shadow still casts a
chill among many Indonesians. Many see his hand, or the hand of his
disenfranchised supporters, behind a continuing series of
destabilizing violent incidents around the country.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest eruption, in the last two days at least four bombs
have hit Christian churches in the Sumatran city of Medan in this
largely Muslim nation. More than 60 people were reported to have
been injured.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Indeed, the order was something of a retreat for Marzuki, who
had said he planned to move Suharto into government custody
elsewhere. That suggestion received opposition even from within the
Cabinet, with some members calling it excessively harsh and warning
about the fragility of the former president's health.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a hard line, Marzuki warned on Friday that the large
deployment of police officers that has held protesters at bay in
front of Suharto's house would be withdrawn if Suharto did not
begin to offer more cooperation to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear, though, how the formal detention order will
affect the course of the questioning, which apparently proceeded as
best it could earlier in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The target has been met, meaning that all the questions have

SENATOR WARNS OF HIGHER GASOLINE PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Maine)   By BRUCE LAMBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Unless action is taken now, gasoline prices will hit
$2.25 a gallon this summer, followed by a spike in heating oil
costs worse than the one last winter, U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer
predicted Monday. But federal energy officials disputed his
figures.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, D-N.Y., urged the Clinton administration to help drive
prices down by releasing federal oil reserves into the market. He
made his proposal in a joint letter dated Friday with Sen. Susan
Collins, R-Maine, to the federal energy secretary, Bill Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   But Richardson disagreed with both the premise and the proposal.
``These are unnecessarily alarmist views, as they do not reflect
current market conditions or projections,'' he said Monday. His
agency's experts forecast a national average price of $1.40 to
$1.45 a gallon by the end of summer. ``Additionally, the solution
to tamper with the strategic petroleum reserve at this stage would
be counterproductive and unrealistic,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   The average price for regular unleaded gasoline in New York City
is $1.64 a gallon, up from $1.27 a year ago, according to a recent
survey by the American Automobile Association. Adjusted for
inflation, however, gasoline is 11 cents cheaper than it was in the
early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The two senators blamed the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, charging that it has failed to keep its promise to
increase production enough to hold crude oil prices to $28 a
barrel. Instead, the price has been hovering around $30.
</P>
<P>
   ``If OPEC continues to constrict supplies of oil and we fail to
release reserves, the price of gasoline will go to $2 this summer
and $2.25 by Labor Day, and home heating-oil prices will be through
the roof,'' Schumer said at a news conference in Manhattan. He
cited estimates by industry analysts like John Kilduff.
</P>
<P>
   Such increases would divert money from other needs and could
curtail summer vacation plans, he said. Worse, increased fuel
charges would raise the price of food and other commodities because
of higher trucking costs. Such inflation could in turn lead the
Federal Reserve Board to push interest rates up, which would slow
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It points a dagger at the heart of our economy,'' Schumer
said. ``Gasoline at $2.25 a gallon is not just a nuisance; it's a
crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, fuel prices began to soar because of cutbacks in
production. Crude oil eventually tripled to $34 a barrel late in
the winter. When Schumer and others first called for the release of
federal reserves, administration officials said they preferred to
seek OPEC's cooperation. ``That has failed,'' Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States' oil reserve is some 600 million barrels
stockpiled in Texas and Louisiana, set aside by law for
emergencies. It has been used only once, by President Bush during
the Persian Gulf war of 1991.

   BC-ARSENIC-WATER-NYT (moved on Wednesday, May 24)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Wednesday, May 24,
about proposed regulations to limit arsenic in tap water referred
incorrectly to estimates of the cancer risk under the proposed
standard of five parts per billion. The Environmental Protection
Agency's estimate of risk, approximately 1 in 10,000, pertains only
to bladder cancer, the most thoroughly studied health risk, and
does not reflect other forms of cancer that can also be caused by
arsenic.
</P>
<P>
   The article also referred incompletely to environmentalists'
threat of a lawsuit if the Clinton administration did not propose
the new regulations quickly. The Natural Resources Defense Council,
an advocacy group, filed such a suit on May 10 to force the release
of the proposal.

CHINA PHONE COMPANY HOPES FOR WARM RECEPTION FOR ITS IPO 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Two months after China's largest oil company
staggered onto the stock market here, the country's second-largest
telecommunications company announced on Monday it would seek to
raise as much as $5.3 billion in an initial public offering in Hong
Kong and New York.
</P>
<P>
   The company, China Unicom Ltd., hopes to get a warmer reception
than PetroChina Ltd., a state-owned oil company that was tarred
prior to its offering by charges of labor and human-rights abuses.
China Unicom will probably be spared those brickbats, analysts
said, given that it is an upstart phone company rather than a vast
oil monopoly with operations in Tibet and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``China Unicom is a very different animal than PetroChina,''
said Andrew Look, an independent fund manager here. ``PetroChina is
a typical old-economy company. China Unicom doesn't have that
baggage. It is a technology play, and a play on China's entry into
the World Trade Organization.''
</P>
<P>
   But Unicom, which was started by the Chinese government six
years ago to challenge the state monopoly, China Telecom, has its
own problems. It recently shelved plans to upgrade its network with
a mobile-phone technology licensed from Qualcomm Corp. And it has
had to unravel joint ventures with more than 20 foreign partners,
whose investments were declared illegal by Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Most troubling, China Unicom only has a 14 percent share of the
country's burgeoning cellular market. China Telecom, which raised
$4.2 billion in a stock offering in 1997, has the bulk of the
business _ not to mention the favor of market analysts, who
consistently put it at the top of their recommended lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unicom has yet to prove its mettle in the marketplace,'' said
Rohit Sobti, an Asian telecommunications analyst at Salomon Smith
Barney here, in a report published in February. ``We believe the
company has a long way to go before it can effectively compete''
with China Telecom.
</P>
<P>
   China Unicom said in its prospectus that it would issue almost
2.46 billion shares at a price between 11.50 Hong Kong dollars, or
$1.48, to 14.50 Hong Kong dollars, or $1.87, per share. It will
also offer 2.34 billion shares in the form of American Depositary
Shares in a price range of $14.76 to $18.61.
</P>
<P>
   If the offering is fully subscribed at the middle of the price
range, the company said, it would raise $4 billion. At the top end
of the range, the proceeds would be almost $5.3 billion, making
Unicom the largest offering in Asia outside Japan. NTT, the
Japanese phone giant, spun off its cellular operation, NTT DoCoMo,
in a record offering that raised $18 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Unicom said it planned to use the cash from the offering to
underwrite a $12 billion expansion of its cellular, long-distance,
and data networks. Although the company is an also-ran in the
mobile-phone market, it operates the largest paging business in
China, with 43.5 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese authorities have helped Unicom by giving it
licenses and injecting the paging business,'' Look said. ``This is
a very sexy story.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Certainly, China Unicom's story has had the elements of a
corporate soap opera. In its early years, the company's status as
an upstart was appealing to foreign investors like Deutsche Telekom
and France Telecom. They agreed to put in money, even though it
meant setting up awkward joint ventures to circumvent China's
restrictions on foreign investment in telecommunications networks.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1998, the Chinese government declared these
arm's-length investments illegal, and ordered the company to
dissolve them. China Unicom spent many months in often-rancorous
negotiations with the partners _ in the process, becoming a symbol
of the perils of foreign investment in China.
</P>
<P>
   China Unicom said it would take a one-time charge of about $100
million to buy out the remainder of the joint ventures. As part of
the settlement, it will also issue warrants that allow its former
partners to buy shares of China Unicom six months after the initial
public offering.
</P>
<P>
   The company's technology foray has been similarly ill-starred.
In February, it signed an agreement with Qualcomm to upgrade its
network with a digital mobile-phone technology known as CDMA, or
code division multiple access. On Monday, it told investors in Hong
Kong it would abandon the plan because CDMA was in danger of being
superseded by ``third generation'' cellular technology in two
years.
</P>
<P>
   With this record of flip-flops and false starts, some analysts
say China Unicom is destined to be a weak sister to China Telecom.
But Unicom can take solace from PetroChina: after being picketed by
protesters and initially spurned by investors, it now trades
comfortably above its offering price.

INTERNET CHANGING REAL ESTATE DEALS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an age when almost anything can be bought online, one of the
main exceptions has been commercial real estate. With its
complicated procedures and time-consuming negotiating process, the
industry has only slowly adapted to the lightning-quick demands of
e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``E-commerce is so fast,'' said Julie Benezet, the director of
global real estate for Amazon.com. ``It is so unlike real estate,
which lumbers along like a mastodon.''
</P>
<P>
   That is changing, but the shape it will take is still far from
clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no one in our industry who is not struggling with
e-business,'' said Frank A. Robinson, a vice president of corporate
real estate at McKesson HBOC, a health-care-supply management
company that oversees 20 million square feet of space. ``It is
going to change the way we do real estate processes, and the ones
who don't get it right are going to be roadkill.''
</P>
<P>
   Some real estate executives are already using
business-to-business services in their daily operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are using e-commerce to do things more quickly and with
fewer people,'' said Scott Leibold, a real estate manager at AT&AMP;T
Corp. ``For example, we can use the system to reserve a conference
room and order the food that will be served during the conference
at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   But many executives say the big savings may come from changing
the way transactions are conducted, especially sales and leases.
</P>
<P>
   That will mean changes in how brokers operate and are paid.
Until recently, a big part of brokers' stock in trade was their
knowledge of the market. Brokers are in the market every day, while
their clients get involved only when their needs change. Brokers
know what properties have been sold or leased; they know how much
money has changed hands; and they know the terms and conditions of
the deals. In tight markets, they know which spaces are likely to
come on the market. In markets glutted with space, they know which
landlords are willing to make financial concessions to lease space.
</P>
<P>
   But that information is becoming more accessible to anyone
willing to pay a price. Two national service companies, CoStar and
RealtyIQ, collect information on property and transactions and make
it available to online subscribers for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the value of market knowledge is suddenly much
lower. ``Any business that is based on knowing things that others
do not will be out of business,'' said Joseph Rubin, a partner in
the real estate practice of Ernst &AMP; Young, the accountants.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers are also expensive. The standard fee for an office
transaction in New York is one-third of the first year's base rent,
paid by the landlord. In a deal for 10,000 square feet at $50 a
square foot a year, the broker's fee would be more than $160,000,
with commissions often split among several brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Top brokerage executives acknowledge that there may be some
erosion of their business, particularly in markets for small office
spaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone is going to sign a lease for 100,000
square feet of office space without a real estate professional
advising them,'' said Stephen B. Siegel, the president of
Insignia/ESG, a national brokerage and real estate services
company. ``But there may be a part of the market, maybe up to
10,000 or 15,000 square feet, that could become a commodity and
trade on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Gosin, chief executive of Newmark &AMP; Co. Real Estate, in
New York, agreed. ``You might see some small leases done
electronically in a tight market,'' he said. ``It might be useful
for small tenants who cannot get the attention of a broker.''
</P>
<P>
   But in larger transactions, he said, brokers advise clients,
analyzing the terms of leases as well as their financial and tax
implications.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, at least one company is trying to circumvent
brokers by using the Internet, offering a big cut in commissions as
a lure. The company, TenantWise.com, in New York, offers to
negotiate leases online at www.tenantwise.com, charging only 20
percent of the standard brokerage commission. M. Myers Mermel, the
president and co-founder, compares the venture to online stock
trading. He calls it ``the Schwab or ETrade of real estate.''
</P>
<P>
   On the site, which has been active only a few weeks, landlords
can post property at no charge. Prospective tenants can send e-mail
messages to TenantWise to schedule visits to the buildings.
</P>
<P>
   TenantWise employees, working with information submitted online,
will help prospective tenants make offers to landlords. The company
also promises to help clients learn the terms of comparable deals.
</P>
<P>
   Mermel says he has submitted offers to landlords for 20 clients,
mostly for spaces smaller than 10,000 square feet. None of the
deals have been concluded, he said. The site is currently limited
to New York, but hopes to go national next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As to whether Tenantwise the wave of the future, it is probably
too soon to tell, according to those working in the industry. But
executives at brokerage companies said they know their businesses
cannot help but change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will deals generate fewer dollars in the future?'' asked
Thomas Falus, the president of New York metropolitan area
operations at Cushman &AMP; Wakefield, ``Yes, that has been a long-term
trend in our industry. But as we become more efficient, we will be
able to charge less.''  &QL;

LAZIO STUMBLES BUT FAILS TO BREAK STRIDE IN DAY OF CAMPAIGNING 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BABYLON, N.Y. _ Rep. Rick Lazio stumbled on the campaign trail
Monday, tripping and falling face down onto the pavement at a
Memorial Day parade here and splitting his lip. But the eager
Senate candidate dusted himself off and finished the route before
going to the hospital, getting eight stitches and then marching in
a second parade, in Queens County, alongside the man he replaced in
the race, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   The injury means that Lazio will most likely have a swollen lip
on Tuesday afternoon, when he is expected to formally accept the
Republican nomination for the Senate at the Republican convention
in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio and his supporters quickly seized upon the accident and
sought to turn it to their advantage, both with humor and by using
it to try to illustrate his perseverance.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bob Dole, who fell off a stage at a campaign stop in
California during the 1996 presidential race, Lazio quickly poked
fun at his mishap. ``I was so happy to be home that I had to kiss
the ground,'' Lazio, who fell in his own Long Island district, said
after leaving the hospital. ``I didn't know that it would kiss
back.''
</P>
<P>
   It was indeed a hometown parade for Lazio, one he said he has
marched in since childhood. Along the way, he greeted many
spectators by name, shook many hands and kissed many babies. Then,
his jacket and tie and leather dress shoes notwithstanding, he
would sprint back to the head of the parade. It was during one of
these sprints that he slipped and fell face down onto Deer Park
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Dabbing at his mouth with a bloodied handkerchief and a bag of
ice from a nearby deli, Lazio finished the parade. Some spectators
were confused at the sight of him, as shouts of ``Good luck,
Rick!'' and ``Keep her out of New York!'' were replaced by cries of
``You've got lipstick on you'' and, more accurately, ``Your lip is
bleeding!'' When Lazio finished the route, his aides looked on
nervously as he paused to talk to reporters about the speech he
plans to deliver in Buffalo on Tuesday before driving back to his
home in nearby Brightwaters for help.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said that once he got home, Lazio's wife, Patricia, who is
a nurse, took one look at his lip and recommended a trip to the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   So he got stitches at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center,
switched into a pair of rubber-soled boat shoes with better
traction, and went back onto the hustings to campaign with Giuliani
at the Little Neck-Douglaston Memorial Day parade along Northern
Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   It marked the first time Giuliani campaigned with Lazio since
deciding not to seek the Republican nomination for the Senate
himself.
</P>
<P>
   This parade was not without chaos either. The mayor and the
injured congressman soon found themselves braving a crush of
reporters so unruly that police reinforcements were called in to
restore order. They also tried talking about campaign issues and
economic opportunities over the din of the roaring mufflers of
Rolling Thunder, a motorcycle club made up of Vietnam veterans that
rallied in the parade.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor seized on all this as evidence of Lazio's grit. ``Look
at him, he's a real New Yorker,'' Giuliani said. ``He's got a fat
lip, he can talk over the worst kinds of noises, it doesn't bother
him and he's out here answering all your questions.''

   NEW WEB SITES ARE ALTERING PATIENTS' VISITS TO DOCTOR
</P>
<P>
   A Web site for physicians created at Stanford University is the
latest entry in a race to transform visits to the doctor by
providing a wealth of online clinical information. Several other
top medical schools are preparing sites of their own, and there are
several commercially operated sites in operation as well.
</P>
<P>
   These Web sites reinforce a doctor's knowledge, suggest
diagnoses, and provide on-the-spot answers to patients' questions
about their symptoms. They also greatly improve medical care for
patients who live far from leading medical centers.

WAR CRY IN THE HAMPTONS: ONE MANSION, ONE VOTE  
 BY BLAINE HARDEN  
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Mich., Colo., N.D., Ind.)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHAMPTON, N.Y. _ Behind the privet hedges that shield the
many monstrous mansions in this village by the sea, something
semi-revolutionary is brewing.
</P>
<P>
   The rich folks who summer in the Village of Southampton are up
in arms, in an understated, law-abiding kind of way, about an
American principle for which Colonial patriots tossed tea into
Boston Harbor: taxation without representation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't say we cannot afford to pay the taxes _ we never
admit to that _ but we don't like to pay taxes that are onerous and
we don't like to be ripped off,'' said Lowell Harwood, a seasonal
resident. Though he owns a beach house here that he estimates is
worth about $6 million, Harwood, like others with a permanent
residence elsewhere, cannot vote in village elections.
</P>
<P>
   The seasonal residents of Southampton, though, are hardly alone
in their hunger for a vote away from home. From Cape Cod to
Colorado, second-home owners are clamoring _ usually with the help
of their lawyers _ for a limited franchise. They want a voice in
how their tax dollars are spent and in how much year-rounders may
charge them for services they seldom use.
</P>
<P>
   Harwood, 70, who made his fortune in parking and property
development in Manhattan and whose glass-and-wood home in the dunes
has a swimming pool, tennis court and putting green, doesn't expect
sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is going to feel sorry for us,'' he said, referring to
himself and his wealthy neighbors on Southampton's Meadow Lane.
``That is not what we are looking for. We just want justice.''
</P>
<P>
   This village, which predates the Boston Tea Party by 133 years,
has been floating in a deep green sea of property tax money since
the 1890s. That's when plutocrats like W.K. Vanderbilt began to
erect gargantuan houses that they insisted on calling cottages.
Since then, in an inexorable march of the moneyed to the sea, more
and more summer people have bought their way into Southampton, as
more and more year-round village residents have been bought out.
</P>
<P>
   According to village officials, about three-quarters of the
village's property taxes are paid by summer people, who have no
vote in local elections unless they choose to make Southampton
their permanent residence. The justice that summer people seek is
the right to vote on village matters, like who will be mayor and
the setting of special tax assessments for roads and water service,
while still keeping their permanent residence back home, which
usually means Manhattan or the suburbs of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Like most states, New York allows residents to claim only one
legal residence for voting purposes. ``You can't have two addresses
for voting,'' said Lee Daghlian, a spokesman for the state Board of
Elections. ``That is the election law.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even some year-round residents of resort communities are
beginning to agree with summer people that the law should bend to
the reality of an increasingly affluent nation where sales of
vacation homes continue to soar. According to a survey this month
by the National Association of Realtors, 377,000 vacation homes
were sold in 1999, an increase of 9.3 percent from the last survey
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is a taxation-without-representation thing up
here,'' said John Quenell, a year-round resident of Lower St. Regis
Lake in New York's Adirondack region and a councilman in the Town
of Brighton. ``The way things work out in the eastern end of Long
Island or up here, it is the people who don't live year-round and
don't use the services who end up footing most of the bills. It is
not fair.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Adirondack village of Speculator, year-round residents
last year approved spending $5.3 million to build a school for 103
students. In response, part-time residents, who account for about
40 percent of the school district's tax base and could not vote on
the proposal, filed a federal lawsuit, which is still pending.
</P>
<P>
   There are about a dozen states, including Connecticut, Colorado,
North Dakota and Indiana, that grant nonresidents a vote on some
local issues. The right was endorsed three years ago by a federal
appeals court in Denver, which ruled that seasonal residents in the
tiny resort of Mountain View could, if they owned property, vote on
all local matters in a town where they pay eight times more
property taxes than year-round residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that the nonresident property owners have a
sufficient interest in town affairs to make it rational for the
town to include them in the political process,'' ruled the 10th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   This is exactly what Bill Hattrick, a former mayor of
Southampton, believes is both fair and inevitable for summer
communities on the South Fork of Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a grave injustice in this country to take the money of
the summer residents and not give them full membership in the
club,'' said Hattrick, a year-round village resident who is
president of the Southampton Association, a group of about 700
mostly part-time residents who own large estates.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars who study tax policy in the United States dispute just
how grave that injustice may be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never been too concerned that the very wealthy are
underrepresented by our political system,'' said James Hines, a
professor of business economics at the University of Michigan
Business School and director of the school's Office of Tax Policy
Research. ``Even if they have one vote, or in this case, no votes,
their interests are still represented by their economic power.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a limit to how much the locals can charge the rich,
Hines said, because the rich can simply move away. But he added
that in the Hamptons, where competition is keen among the rich and
celebrated to flaunt their money and celebrity, the soak-the-rich
limit might well be incalculable.
</P>
<P>
   ``On one hand, it is unfair,'' said Hines, referring to what he
said is a well-established pattern of year-round residents'
extracting high taxes from seasonal property owners. ``On the other
hand, it is hard to cry your eyes out about it, given all the other
tragedies in the world.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Year-round residents of the Hamptons, who spend their summers
stuck in traffic and who have seen countless potato farms gobbled
up by mansions on steroids, certainly are not shedding tears for
the disfranchised pain of summer people.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't really make an intelligent decision as a voter if
you are only out here three months a year,'' said Francesca Haley,
a waitress at Silver's Restaurant on Main Street in Southampton,
who lives in nearby Bridgehampton. ``I don't feel they have a right
to dictate how my life is going to be when they are not here.''
</P>
<P>
   Harwood, the wealthy developer, says he does not want to dictate
anything to the year-round residents. He said he merely wants to
fix a costly problem with his water bill, which he says is a
monument to ``taxation without representation and taxation without
service.''
</P>
<P>
   Harwood and about 100 other similarly rich property owners on
Meadow Lane in Southampton pay hefty water taxes to the nearby
Hampton Bays Water District, although they do not receive a drop of
water from the district.
</P>
<P>
   Harwood pays $1,800 a year for this nondelivery of water. He
also pays about $700 a year for water that he does receive from the
Town of Southampton Water Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Since a hurricane severed a water line in 1938, no one in
Southampton Village has been able to take water from the Hampton
Bays Water District. But this has not stopped the annual billing.
The 5,900 or so people who do receive water (and who live next door
in Hampton Bays, a moderate-income community) like having their
water taxes subsidized by rich Southampton folks who cannot use
what they must pay for.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can afford a house like mine, these people feel that I
can afford to pay their water bill,'' Harwood said. ``I don't mind
giving money away to charity, but I don't like it taken away.''
</P>
<P>
   A referendum has been proposed that would allow voters in the
water district to decide if the 100 Southampton property owners in
the district who get no water can stop paying bills, which average
$1,500 a year. The rub in any such referendum, of course, is that
property owners like Harwood, whose permanent residence is in Short
Hills, N.J., would not be eligible to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to see if we can get the vote,'' Harwood said.
``Then we are probably going to have to sue.''
</P>
<P>
   Politicians in the Hamptons say that in general, they are
sympathetic to both the frustrations of summer residents and the
resentments of year-rounders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Permanent residents feel they can't drive around any more
because of traffic, and sometimes they can't even walk around
because of the crowds of summer people,'' said Joseph Romanosky
Jr., the mayor of Southampton Village, which has a year-round
population of about 3,900 and a summer population of about 25,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now you are telling them that the summer people should
have the right to vote?'' asked the mayor. ``They don't know these
people and they don't trust them.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Thiele, the state assemblyman whose district includes
Southampton, said the Legislature in Albany would sooner or later
be forced to address the voting matter seriously. In his district
on the South Fork of Long Island, nonresidents own more than half
the residential property.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue is not going to go away,'' he said.

FLORIDA TOWN HOLDS MEMORIAL FOR SLAIN TEACHER 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE WORTH, Fla. _ After a long weekend of mourning, more than a
thousand residents of this small town gathered at a rally to call
for an end to violence and to remember a popular teacher slain on
Friday by a seventh grader.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors, family and students of the teacher, Barry Grunow, 35,
held hands and encircled Bryant Park here to remember the teacher.
They prayed and talked about ways to prevent yet another school
shooting. The slogan of the rally, held aloft on banners and
printed on T-shirts was ``stop the violence and nurture the
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people wore yellow ribbons around their arms and carried
signs reading slogans like ``Love your children, Lock your guns.''
Residents called on lawmakers to take gun control more seriously.
If violence could happen in their tiny community, they said, it
could happen anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad part is it keeps happening,'' said Barbara Lynch, who
has lived in Lake Worth for 15 years. ``It happened to a lovely
man, to a community man.''
</P>
<P>
   As many current and former students cried and embraced each
other at the rally, they spoke about Grunow's gentle nature They
said the teacher used to lovingly tease his students, reward them
with cookies and doughnuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the kind of teacher you'll never forget because he
believed in hands-on learning,'' said Crystal Bruder, 16, a former
student. ``When we were studying Greek mythology in class, he'd
have us all dress up, and he made me dress up as a tree for
scenery. His lessons were unforgettable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Learning with him was fun,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But students said they would remember Grunow mostly as a friend,
a teacher who tried to be approachable.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of my friends would go to him when they had problems,''
said Amber Hart, 12, a student of Grunow's. ``We felt comfortable
talking to him. He was so nice. I don't understand why this
happened to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Amber said she also knew 13-year-old Nathaniel Brazill, who is
being held in the death of Grunow.
</P>
<P>
   The boy had been sent home from school on Friday, the last day
of school before summer, for throwing water balloons. According to
police, he returned two hours later with a handgun and shot Grunow
once in the head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nate was in my advanced math class,'' she said. ``He's a nice
boy. I don't know why he did that to Mr. Grunow. It's all so
confusing.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton chose to spend Memorial
Day walking in a parade in her adopted hometown on Monday and
offering an attack, albeit indirectly, on her soon-to-be-nominated
Republican opponent for the U.S. Senate over his opposition to
handgun registration.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when Memorial Day parades throughout the state
attracted political candidates of every stripe, Clinton said she
selected the relatively modest parade in the town where she moved
five months ago, because it reminded her of commemorations in the
Chicago suburb where she was raised.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, the Democratic nominee for Senate, did not mention her
Republican opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio, by name. But she indirectly
criticized the congressman's opposition to handgun registration by
re-emphasizing her own position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to reiterate my call for the licensing and
registration of handguns,'' Clinton said, speaking to reporters
after a Memorial Day ceremony in front of the Chappaqua railroad
station. ``I just think we ought to do everything we possibly can
to keep them away from people who are criminally inclined.''
</P>
<P>
   She said several people at the program had told her of their
horror at the recent killing of five employees at a Wendy's
restaurant in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to stress what a lot of my neighbors and a lot of
people in the community are saying to me _ we have to do more, not
only to be tough on criminals, but we have to be tough on the
weapons that criminals use,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Lazio's campaign, Bryan Flood, declined to
respond directly to Clinton's comments, but he reiterated that
Lazio favors many forms of gun control but not registration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congressman Lazio has long supported common-sense gun control,
often breaking with his own party,'' Flood said by telephone from
Buffalo. For example, he said, Lazio supported the Brady bill and
the ban on assault weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he believes that before we take the dramatic step of
registration, we ought to look at ensuring that existing
common-sense gun laws are enforced, and this administration's
record on enforcing those gun laws is poor,'' Flood said.
</P>
<P>
   In the days since Lazio emerged as the Republican candidate,
Clinton's aides have been preparing to emphasize his opposition to
some forms of gun control and to public financing of abortions for
the poor. Both are issues that her campaign aides suggest could
help her standing among female voters.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady was received enthusiastically on her first
Memorial Day as a Chappaqua resident. Many along the quarter-mile
parade route cheered as she walked by, amid a small contingent of
Girl Scouts. (Clinton is the organization's national honorary
chairwoman.)

ISRAELI PULLOUT HAS FISHERMEN CELEBRATING 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TYRE, Lebanon _ As a burning red sun sank into the Mediterranean
on Monday, fishermen in this ancient Phoenician port unloaded
record catches from their skiffs and busily repaired nets before
heading out again at dawn Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   For two decades, such a scene was a rarity. But as Shiite Muslim
guerrillas revel in the end of Israel's 22-year occupation of
southern Lebanon, local fishermen find they have something to
celebrate as well.
</P>
<P>
   The fishermen said they are landing record harvests from fertile
fishing grounds that was completely closed off to them by Israeli
gunships.
</P>
<P>
   The fishermen said the Israelis often fired upon their boats
that dared to venture off the coast of southern Lebanon. Boats that
did stray into the roughly 10 miles of Israeli-patroled waters, the
fishermen said, were often confiscated by the Israeli navy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Israelis were strangling us like this,'' said fisherman
Elias Safadi, putting his hands around his throat. ``But now we can
breathe. Now the waters that our fathers fished and that their
fathers fished are ours again. We have never been so busy in our
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Safadi, 40, had struggled most of his life to feed his wife and
two young daughters on catches that brought him about $5 a day. But
he has pocketed nearly $100 a day for the last five days since the
Israelis withdrew from the self-proclaimed ``security zone'' they
occupied in south Lebanon to protect northern Israel against
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Since the withdrawal, Safadi said his two daughters, ages 2 and
3, have new shoes. He has also bought his wife a new washing
machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are celebrating, and I am just focusing on working. Who
knows how long it will last,'' said Safadi, who has lived through
Lebanon's civil war and the Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
   There are 475 fishermen registered with Tyre Fisherman's
Association, which runs a port that had existed for 1,000 years
under the Phoenician empire before it fell to Alexander the Great
in the fourth century BC.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the organization, Khalil Taha, said that all of the
fishermen are reporting catches at least 20 times the value of what
they have caught in a generation. Although Lebanon has a long
coastline that stretches up to Beirut, the fishermen say the warmer
and most profitable waters are all south of Tyre.
</P>
<P>
   There is some concern that the extraordinary catches could bring
a glut in the market that could plunge retail prices to levels so
low that they could permanently disrupt the market. But for now the
fisherman seemed too consumed with filling their nets to worry
about economic trends.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 22 years the only fishermen able to freely work the
rugged coastline of south Lebanon were a small collection of
inexperienced fishermen aligned with the Israeli-backed South
Lebanon Army.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis assigned special numbers to a dozen SLA boats, and
left them undisturbed. But other fishermen were subject to
harassment, arrests, beatings, and sometimes gunfire by the Israeli
navy, the fishermen said.
</P>
<P>
   The strict patrolling of the coastline divided the fishing
community sharply along sectarian lines. The Christian fishermen of
the port said they did not dare fish the waters fearing that they
would be suspected as collaborators with the Christian-led SLA. But
the Muslims often defiantly embarked on midnight runs, trying to
avoid the Israeli navy in search of fish.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan Malek, 32, a Muslim, said he tried three times to defy
the Israeli ban on fishing, and each time he was shot and wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not political, I am a fisherman. But this is our water,
and we have every right to fish in it,'' he said.

SENIOR LEBANESE MILITANTS APPEAR AT HEARING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALIZA MARCUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV _ For the first time since they were seized by Israeli
forces, two senior Lebanese militants whom Israel had hoped to
trade for captured air force navigator Ron Arad appeared in public
at a Tel Aviv district court hearing Monday on whether they should
be released.
</P>
<P>
   Sheikh Abdel Karim Obeid, 43, a Hezbollah spiritual leader
abducted in 1989 by Israeli forces in south Lebanon, and Mustafa
Dirani, 49, security chief for the Amal group that captured Arad
when his fighter plane went down in 1986, followed the hearing
through a translator sitting at their side.
</P>
<P>
   Bearded and pale, Obeid wore the white skullcap of a religious
leader, and he looked almost dazed by the attention. Dirani, who
had dark hair and a dark beard, kept his eyes firmly planted on
their lawyer. At one point Dirani, who was captured in 1994,
demanded to speak, repeating assertions that he lost track of Arad
after 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The men, who are being held together in a secret location in
Israel, have denied knowing anything about Arad's current
whereabouts. Neither Dirani nor Obeid has ever been charged by
Israel with any crime.
</P>
<P>
   Their lawyer argued Monday that neither man was a security
threat, saying both had stated that when Israel withdrew from south
Lebanon _ as happened last week _ there would be no reason to go on
fighting, .
</P>
<P>
   But the Tel Aviv court, which was packed Monday with observers
and groups opposed to the men's release, delayed issuing a
decision, saying more time was needed to study the arguments. It
will reconvene July 12.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, a senior United Nations envoy asked Israel to release
all Lebanese prisoners to lessen tension in southern Lebanon, from
which Israeli troops withdrew last week after 22 years of
occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Although there have been no serious clashes since Israel
completed its withdrawal, Hezbollah officials in Lebanon said their
guerrilla war against Israel _ which appears at least to have been
suspended _ will not end until the Lebanese prisoners are freed.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the prisoners are Hezbollah fighters tried and jailed in
Israel, but Dirani's and Obeid's detention is directly linked to
missing airman Arad Dirani, who was responsible for Arad after the
airman was captured, took Arad with him when he split from the Amal
group two years later. After Dirani was abducted by Israel, he
reportedly told his interrogators that in 1989 he transferred Arad
to Iranian Revolutionary Guards in Lebanon. Since then, there
apparently has been no concrete information on where Arad is held
or whether he is still alive.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue is one that has been kept alive in Israel, where
``Free Ron Arad'' bumper stickers are common and Arad's family is
invited to meet with Israeli politicians and defense officials. If
Arad is still alive, he is 41 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The basic argument in court is over whether Dirani and Obeid
pose a threat to Israel's security _ which would block their
release _ or should be released because they have no information
about Arad and are being held illegally, defense lawyer Zvi Rish
said.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of releasing the two men arose last month when the
High Court of Justice ruled that Israel could not hold people
simply as ``bargaining chips,'' to be traded for soldiers missing
in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the ruling, which followed years of petitions by
Rish, Israel released 13 Lebanese citizens who had been held for 14
years or longer. Some had never been tried for any crimes, while
others had long before served out their sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was hailed by human rights groups but sparked anger
among some Israeli politicians, who have prepared a bill that would
give the state the legal right to hold people who act against the
state or whose detention may aid in securing the release of
Israelis held by enemy forces.

EDITORIAL: THE SENATE PRIMARY IN NEW JERSEY 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, May 30:
</P>
<P>
   The Senate race in New Jersey, lately overshadowed by the recent
political drama in New York, now moves to center stage with two
hotly contested primary elections on June 6. Voters must choose
Democratic and Republican nominees for a general-election contest
that could figure in the battle for control of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic race offers a choice between Jon Corzine, an
earnest, big-spending political novice, and Jim Florio, a
battle-scarred but knowledgeable former governor.
</P>
<P>
   Florio's strong record of achievement has vastly improved the
lives of New Jersey residents, while his strong personality has
also created an army of enemies, even within his own party.
Florio's scrappy nature helped produce such gems as the Pinelands
Preservation Act that now protects 1 million acres in the state.
</P>
<P>
   During his terms in Congress and as governor, he fought to
create the Superfund, as well as to clean up and preserve the
state's beaches. As governor, Florio stood up to the auto insurance
industry, and his success in making New Jersey the first state to
outlaw semiautomatic assault weapons made him a favorite enemy of
the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of a court order, Florio increased education
financing by springing a surprise tax increase of $2.8 billion on
New Jersey voters. The political blunder, now the stuff of legend
in New Jersey, led to his defeat by Christie Whitman in 1993. But
it is important to remember that Florio's failure was one of
salesmanship, not in his choice of remedies for schools that needed
the money.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine is also an advocate of educational improvement and such
worthy goals as universal health care. The fact that he is a former
co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. who retired with a $400 million
fortune makes his unabashed, old-fashioned liberalism all the more
striking. But an unselfish nature cannot substitute for deep
knowledge of public policy. When it comes to such details as
explaining the $30 billion price tag of his health insurance
proposal, Corzine is simply not in Florio's league.
</P>
<P>
   He is also tone deaf on the issue of money in politics. Corzine
has spent more than $30 million in a largely self-financed campaign
and has used his deep pockets for contributions to local parties as
a way to win the support of other Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In an age when candidates should be moving toward financial
transparency, he has cited partnership agreements with Goldman
Sachs as the reason for refusing to release a detailed account of
his sources of wealth. All that might be tolerable if Corzine had
advanced a detailed plan for campaign finance reform, but his grasp
of that issue seems hazy and perfunctory.
</P>
<P>
   For all these reasons, we urge New Jersey Democrats to vote for
Florio as the more seasoned and knowledgeable candidate. We do so
with full respect for the nobility of Corzine's political impulses
and with the hope that he will become a more articulate student of
public policy.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, the four contenders include three
moderates and one former Libertarian. James Treffinger has gotten
excellent reviews as Essex County executive, but the real race is
between Rep. Bob Franks and state Sen. William Gormley.
</P>
<P>
   Gormley, a forceful ex-Marine, is widely admired in some circles
for the independence he showed in 1990 as the only Senate
Republican voting for Florio's ban on assault weapons. That is a
considerable badge of honor. Franks was in the New Jersey Assembly
at the time, but skipped the key votes. As a congressman, however,
Franks has supported gun control measures.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of these candidates is free of weaknesses. Although they
have similar moderate Republican views, Franks tends to circle
issues more tentatively, coming around slowly even to the strongest
issue in his portfolio, campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Gormley, whose fulminations in Trenton are legendary, has less
difficulty standing firm. But he has a mixed record on the
environment, and his campaign is shadowed by his reliance on
campaign contributions from the casino industry and shoreline
developers in his Atlantic City area.
</P>
<P>
   Franks, for his part, has voted to support campaign finance
reform, although he is not a leader on the issue. Despite a
troubling committee vote in 1995 to weaken regulations under the
Clean Water Act, Franks has since won improving marks from New
Jersey environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   On the basis of his overall record as a dependable member of the
GOP's moderate wing and his better record on campaign finance, we
urge New Jersey Republicans to choose Franks as their Senate
nominee.

 &HT;    Ontario town battling bacteria, fear
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALKERTON, Ontario _ At this time of year, with new growth
laying a haze of green over the wet fields, the farm country around
this small town smells faintly but distinctly of manure. It's a
rich, warm aroma, appropriate to the place that bills itself on
road signs as ``Canada's foremost cattle county.''
</P>
<P>
   But follow the dip in Hwy. 4 over the Saugeen River and down
into Walkerton, and the smell changes noticeably. It is acrid and
ammoniac. It hits you in the back of the nose, and it is weirdly
familiar.
</P>
<P>
   It smells like a swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   It's bleach. All the people living in Walkerton, and most of the
objects out in public _ doorknobs, store counters, cafe tables _
have been washed or been swabbed with a potent mixture of chlorine
bleach and water. It is the most effective way to kill the bacteria
that has contaminated their water system and invaded their lives:
E. coli O157:H7.
</P>
<P>
   Since the outbreak was made public a week ago, a toddler and
four older women have died, and a fifth woman is close to death in
the local hospital. Eleven children are in intensive care, with
five children and three adults on dialysis. Overall, about 1,000
people in this town of fewer than 5,000 have had some combination
of the fever, cramps, diarrhea and disorientation that the bug can
cause, and more than 30 a day are still reporting to the emergency
department.
</P>
<P>
   It may be the largest E. coli outbreak in North American
history. It may also be the longest in duration.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence emerged over the weekend that the contamination may
have been present for months before the area's health officer
defied the local water department and issued an emergency order to
boil the local water.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on the almost deserted streets of Walkerton, there is little
anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an emotional society,'' said Joel Axler, who moved
to Walkerton 18 months ago from Toronto. ``People are extremely
compassionate, and they are forgiving _ maybe too forgiving.''
</P>
<P>
   Axler began getting symptoms in late winter, he said. By early
May he was sick enough to cancel engagements, including a friend's
50th birthday party, that took him away fution calls first for
``peace, order, and good government.''
</P>
<P>
   No plans to hold a town meeting have been announced; no one has
called for one. An attempt at a demonstration drew two protesters.
When the premier of Ontario came to town last week, one resident
shouted at him, but others asked for his autograph.
</P>
<P>
   Townsfolk have stuck together. A prominent columnist for the
Post, a national newspaper, has praised them in print for their
sense of privacy. Over the weekend, garage sales went ahead as
planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see an awful lot of people doing yard work,'' Axler said.
``They're fixing and painting and banging holes in trees. It's a
way of sublimating.''
</P>
<P>
   But as bleach left on too long will rot fabric, there are signs
the fabric of Walkerton is beginning to fray. Six law firms have
announced plans for lawsuits, including one launched over the
weekend that asks for $1 billion in damages.
</P>
<P>
   The legal action is controversial, further dividing residents
who already feel betrayed by elements of life as basic as the
neighbors they live next to and the water they drink.
</P>
<P>
   If the lawsuits go forward, they will keep formerly little-known
Walkerton in the public eye for a very long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This friendly little town that never had an identity to the
outside world is going to be thought of forever as the epicenter of
a national disaster,'' Axler said. ``It's so sad.''

KNICKS EDGE PACERS, 91-89 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the injured New York Knicks who could slip into
their orange-trimmed jerseys, they used adrenaline as a wonder drug
on Monday night to overcome the various ailments picking on their
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Only Patrick Ewing was unable to play in Game 4 of the Eastern
Conference finals, while Latrell Sprewell danced around on a bad
foot, Marcus Camby leaped on a sore knee and Larry Johnson hung out
on the wing unencumbered by a chronically sore back.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, Johnson was feeling only the euphoria. It was last
year revisited for him. After the Pacers slashed the Knicks'
17-point halftime lead to 1 point with just under seven minutes
left in the game, Johnson anchored himself in front of the right
sideline and launched three 3-pointers over the next four minutes
to give the Knicks a remarkable 91-89 victory at Madison Square
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks evened the four-of-seven-game series at two games
apiece. Game 5 will be played at Conseco Fieldhouse in Indianapolis
on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Once a blowout, Game 4 turned into a tight finish that wasn't
decided until the final seconds. After the Pacers pulled within 3
points, at 90-87, with 6.4 seconds remaining, Sprewell missed two
free throws with 4.1 seconds left on the clock. But on the second
miss, Jalen Rose was called for a lane violation. On the third
attempt, Sprewell connected and gave the Knicks an impenetrable
4-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sprewell had his troubles scoring (12 points) and
keeping up with Rose (18 points), he hit the free throw he had to
make. Johnson, who beat the Pacers in Game 3 of last year's Eastern
Conference finals with a 4-point play, made everything else. He
finished with 25 points and was 5 of 5 from 3-point range. With
Sprewell ailing, and Camby (8 rebounds, 5 points) not himself,
Johnson, Charlie Ward (16 points, 7 assists), Kurt Thomas (16
points) and Allan Houston (17 points) were the foils to Reggie
Miller's 24-point night.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks shot 49 percent from the field and limited the Pacers
to 45.6 percent. More surprisingly, they outrebounded the bigger
Pacers, 41-32. The Knicks watched their 17 point-lead at the half
come under a serious threat as the Pacers began to cut into it,
little by little, with Rose playing loose and free. He pulled the
Pacers right back into the game with a wild bank shot over Johnson
with just under 10 minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, that cushy lead was down to 4 points. It was down to
77-76 when Miller hit an open 3-pointer in transition three minutes
later. But just as he had done in the past to the Pacers, Johnson
then devastated their comeback with a 3-pointer with 6 minutes 20
seconds left in the game. Waiting patiently on the right wing,
Johnson then hit another 3-pointer with four minutes remaining to
put the Knicks up by 85-76. His third came with just over two
minutes remaining.

PERCIVAL ENDS JACOBS JINX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND -- Angels manager Mike Scioscia just shook his head no
when asked if he knew anything about Troy Percival's history at
Jacobs Field. In might have been a white lie, but as far as
Scioscia's concerned, the past is old news.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia is only concerned with what his closer is doing now,
and on a breezy Memorial Day afternoon, Percival earned his first
career save at Jacobs Field in the Angels' 3-2, 10-inning victory
over the Indians before a sellout crowd of 42,888 fans.
</P>
<P>
   Percival went into the game having made seven appearances here,
and the numbers weren't pretty: 0-3, three blown saves and a 19.06
ERA. But after the game, Percival wasn't about to reflect on old
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not even going to dwell on anything negative,'' said
Percival, who struck out pinch hitter Alex Ramirez with two runners
on base to end it. ``Any time I get a save or don't get a save with
these guys it always seems to be negative. Sometimes they get you
and sometimes you get them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, they got him, as Percival was 0-6 with an 8.41 ERA vs.
Cleveland in his career overall before Monday. But this one was
different, and he got a boost from Scioscia along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Percival entered the 10th with a 3-2 lead and retired the first
two batters before Omar Vizquel ripped a double to right-center.
Roberto Alomar was up next, but after a meeting on the mound with
Scioscia and all the infielders, Percival walked Alomar
intentionally. That goes against ``the book,'' because Alomar
represented the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   But the strategy worked as Percival blew a fastball past Ramirez
to end it.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, Roberto Alomar is really a guy you don't want to give
a chance to tie the game,'' Scioscia said. ``I have confidence in
Percy, but I was more comfortable with the matchup with Ramirez, or
anyone coming off their bench. I'm thinking we're not going to play
for a tie on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It made sense,'' Percival said. ``You've got a force at every
base (except home). That guy (Alomar) had four plate-appearances
and he'd seen the ball. The other guy (Ramirez) was a player who'd
been sitting on the bench all day. It's just a smart move.''
</P>
<P>
   Percival and the Angels were in a position to win the game
because Troy Glaus homered leading off the top of the 10th to break
a 2-2 tie. It was his 16th homer of the season, second on the team
to Mo Vaughn's 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good pitch, a curveball down,'' Glaus said of the 0-1
pitch by Steve Karsay (0-3). ``I wasn't up there trying to win the
ballgame, just trying to get a pitch to drive and get on base.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Jarrod Washburn pitched five hitless innings, but
had to leave the game -- despite a plea to stay in -- because of a
tight left shoulder. That left it up to the bullpen to preserve a
2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Al Levine threw two scoreless innings before Mike Holtz entered
the game in the eighth. But the defense made two errors in the
inning, allowing two unearned runs to score and tie the game. They
did manage to escape further damage by getting an unusual double
play.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus booted Kenny Loften's grounder to open the inning, but
Holtz struck out Omar Vizquel. Scioscia brought in Shigetoshi
Hasegawa (4-0) hoping for the double-play grounder, but instead
Alomar grounded the ball into right field for a single, driving
Loften to third.
</P>
<P>
   Hasegawa then got the grounder he was looking for. Manny Ramirez
hit a routine grounder to Adam Kennedy at second, but Kennedy
fumbled the ball away as he was making the flip to Benji Gil at
second. Loften scored and the Indians had runners on first and
second.
</P>
<P>
   David Justice followed with a slow roller through the hole at
short, driving in Alomar to tie the game. But Dave Roberts, who was
running for Ramirez at first, got thrown out at third by left
fielder Darin Erstad.
</P>
<P>
   Justice also tried to take the extra base, but Glaus threw to
Kennedy at second to complete the 7-5-4 double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the way you draw it up, that's for sure,'' Gil
said. ``But it worked.''

JONI MITCHELL AND HER SONGS AGE WITH GRACE AND CLASS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Joni Mitchell was received like royalty by a sold-out
audience at the FleetBoston Pavilion on Sunday. She deserved every
ounce of adulation _ not only for being the musical poet laureate
of a generation but for the uncompromising, adventurous spirit that
has taken her away from the singer-songwriter masterpieces for
which she is beloved, and deeper and deeper into the world of jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Jazz flavors can be traced all the way back to 1974's ``Court
and Spark,'' and Mitchell's next studio album, ``The Hissing of
Summer Lawns,'' was a bold turn toward avant-garde-inspired
experimentation. Since then, she's collaborated predominantly with
jazz players. So it's no great surprise that Mitchell's new album,
``Both Sides Now,'' is a full embrace of 20th-century jazz
standards (plus a pair of originals). She performed the entire
album in order, backed by a shimmering 70-piece orchestra, and for
good reason. The songs trace the arc of a modern romantic
relationship, from flirtation (``You're My Thrill'') through
consummation (``At Last'') to disillusionment (``You've Changed''),
despair (``Don't Go to Strangers''), and finally a semblance of
philosophical perspective, crystallized in heart-breaking shades of
real-life grays on the singer's own classic ``Both Sides Now.''
</P>
<P>
   At 56, Mitchell is an inate jazz singer. Her technical range is
narrow, but her sense of feel and phrasing flows from pure
intuition, and years of smoking has left her with a deep, dusky
instrument that seems made for the langorous ballads that dominated
her set. In fact, the one strike against the two-hour show
(including an intermission) was its pace, which was in perpetual
low gear. But Mitchell, ever the iconoclast, would be the last to
ascribe to a conventional notion of dynamic pacing. Showmanship has
never been the point. So with her fingers fluttering and wrapped
head-to-toe in resplendent hues of apricot and red, Mitchell simply
sang the songs in the deep, knowing tones of a seasoned romantic.
</P>
<P>
   And she made us feel, which was always the point. While the
orchestra summoned both the lush emotion and delicate nuance of the
songs' poetry, Mitchell's still-bright timbre lit up the joyous and
melancholy words _ among the few that rival her own for sheer
poignance and savvy _ her ravaged vibrato the punctuation to every
phrase.
</P>
<P>
   She transformed the album's two original compositions from quiet
folk anthems to luminous epics. ``A Case of You'' _ the familiar
dulcimer strains changed to ethereal strings, a mournful clarinet,
and swirling brushes on a drum _ fit into the romance cycle roughly
midway through the disillusionment phase when, as Mitchell put it,
``tender entreaties have failed and it's time to head for the
bar.'' ``Both Sides Now,'' the sage, bittersweet finish to the song
cycle, was a revelation: a timeless meditation that's as true and
telling today as it was 31 years ago. But the real beauty was in
how the song _ like Mitchell, like the rest of us _ has grown up,
textured now with haunting new harmonies and rich, complex swells.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell's ``good friend and ex-husband'' Larry Klein, also her
producer and musical director, came out to play stunning bass parts
during the encore numbers: a playful ``Be Cool,'' which will be on
the upcoming follow-up to ``Both Sides Now,'' imperially moody
reworkings of ``Judgement of the Moon and Stars (Ludwig's Tune)''
and ``For the Roses'' _ both indictments of the music business _ a
densely layered read on ``Hejira,'' and finally Marvin Gaye's own
industry kiss-off, ``Trouble Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans were understandably thrilled to hear the older songs. But
it was equally thrilling to realize _ witnessing the
transliteration of Mitchell's songs from the simple alphabet of a
gentle lullabye to the dazzling language of a symphony _ how
magnificent these songs always were, and how gifted a musician
Mitchell continues to be.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the injured New York Knicks who could slip into
their orange-trimmed jerseys, they used adrenaline as a wonder drug
on Monday night to overcome the various ailments picking on their
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Only Patrick Ewing was unable to play in Game 4 of the Eastern
Conference finals, while Latrell Sprewell danced around on a bad
foot, Marcus Camby leaped on a sore knee and Larry Johnson hung out
on the wing unencumbered by a chronically sore back.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, Johnson was feeling only the euphoria. It was last
year revisited for him. After the Pacers slashed the Knicks'
17-point halftime lead to 1 point with just under seven minutes
left in the game, Johnson anchored himself in front of the right
sideline and launched three 3-pointers over the next four minutes
to give the Knicks a remarkable 91-89 victory at Madison Square
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks evened the four-of-seven-game series at two games
apiece. Game 5 will be played at Conseco Fieldhouse in Indianapolis
on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Once a blowout, Game 4 turned into a tight finish that wasn't
decided until the final seconds. After the Pacers pulled within 3
points, at 90-87, with 6.4 seconds remaining, Sprewell missed two
free throws with 4.1 seconds left on the clock. But on the second
miss, Jalen Rose was called for a lane violation. On the third
attempt, Sprewell connected and gave the Knicks an impenetrable
4-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sprewell had his troubles scoring (12 points) and
keeping up with Rose (18 points), he hit the free throw he had to
make. Johnson, who beat the Pacers in Game 3 of last year's Eastern
Conference finals with a 4-point play, made everything else. He
finished with 25 points and was 5 of 5 from 3-point range. With
Sprewell ailing, and Camby (8 rebounds, 5 points) not himself,
Johnson, Charlie Ward (16 points, 7 assists), Kurt Thomas (16
points) and Allan Houston (17 points) were the foils to Reggie
Miller's 24-point night.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks shot 49 percent from the field and limited the Pacers
to 45.6 percent. More surprisingly, they outrebounded the bigger
Pacers, 41-32. The Knicks watched their 17 point-lead at the half
come under a serious threat as the Pacers began to cut into it,
little by little, with Rose playing loose and free. He pulled the
Pacers right back into the game with a wild bank shot over Johnson
with just under 10 minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, that cushy lead was down to 4 points. It was down to
77-76 when Miller hit an open 3-pointer in transition three minutes
later. But just as he had done in the past to the Pacers, Johnson
then devastated their comeback with a 3-pointer with 6 minutes 20
seconds left in the game. Waiting patiently on the right wing,
Johnson then hit another 3-pointer with four minutes remaining to
put the Knicks up by 85-76. His third came with just over two
minutes remaining.

SPORTS COLUMN: KNICKS TIE THEIR LACES, AND SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ New Yorkers being a highly knowledgeable lot, Knicks
fans even dispense advice on the proper way to dress before a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tie 'em tight,'' somebody shouted to Latrell Sprewell on
Sunday afternoon, as he laced up the sneaker on his injured left
foot.
</P>
<P>
   Ever solicitous, the fans wanted to see the most possible
support of the tiny fractured bone, and they had other advice
bordering on the inspirational for the assorted walking wounded.
This was before the Knicks stunned the fans _ but probably not
themselves _ by embarrassing Indiana, 91-89, to tie this series at
two games apiece.
</P>
<P>
   It perhaps should be no surprise, since the Knicks jolted the
Pacers the same way last year, also without Patrick Ewing. In the
process, the Knicks have turned the corner from a headstrong and
occasionally loutish bunch in the Pat Riley era to gallant and even
resourceful players under Jeff Van Gundy who fit into the demanding
standards of New York fans.
</P>
<P>
   The fans were looking for miracles when the day began. The
Knicks' predicament was stated quite baldly on the pregame lineup
notes:
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing: ``Acute peroneal tendinitis right foot, day to
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Camby: ``Sprained medial capsule, right knee, day to
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Latrell Sprewell: ``Incomplete fracture of fifth metatarsal,
left foot, day to day.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a serious load of injuries. The players reported for
pregame workouts looking pretty good. Of course, they were well
rested, having snoozed on the training tables while the training
staff performed miracles on damaged tissue.
</P>
<P>
   The trainers, meanwhile, looked positively awful. Mike Saunders
and Said Hamdan looked as if they had not slept in days, which, of
course, they had not. ``We pulled out all the stops today,'' Hamdan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the trainers do not report to the Westchester County
training site before a day game, but there was work to be done, so
Hamdan made the long schlep from Nassau County to the Connecticut
border to administer to the legions. ``I've been in restaurants and
bakeries with shorter lines for a table or a loaf,'' Hamdan said.
</P>
<P>
   The work paid off in bodies, since Spree and Camby were able to
stay in uniform for the game, while Ewing had to change into a
handsome dark striped suit, and do his best work waving an orange
rally towel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't any question of how hard they would play,'' Van
Gundy said. ``The question is whether they'd be able to play.''
</P>
<P>
   It is to the credit of the Knicks and the league that they
disclosed the injuries. This would never happen in hockey, where
teams conveniently forget to disclose minor details like broken
bones and wrenched joints, for the very good reason that somebody
on the other side would be sure to test that injury early.
</P>
<P>
   Such opportunism seemed beyond the Pacers, sportsmen to the
core. In the absence of Ewing, the Pacers rarely lobbed the ball to
the 7-foot-4-inch Dutchman, Rik Smits, to try to isolate Smits for
his characteristic soft shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers seemed to want to win fair and square, perhaps
confirming Larry Bird's own worst suspicions about his team, that
it does not know how to finish off a damaged opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday brought back memories of last year, when Ewing was also
wobbly, when the Pacers appeared on a straight path to the finals,
only to have uproarious things happen. For the record: the Knicks
won in six games.
</P>
<P>
   It seems almost laughable that the Knicks could be so smooth, so
fine, so accurate, with so many injuries. Sprewell seemed to have
plenty of forward leap, but his lateral moves were suspect. Camby
was visibly hobbling, and Van Gundy saved him for a late spurt.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the game, the fans applauded the Knicks. These were not
the artificial cheers spurred on by the witless sounds from the
public-address system, but rather the warm and impromptu sounds of
fans who had gotten more out of this cool, sweet Memorial Day
weekend than they ever could have imagined.
</P>
<P>
   The franchise that had self-destructed in fights and suspensions
in the past is now showing the resourcefulness that New York fans
used to expect. One glaring statistic from the Indiana playoff
series of last year and this is that the Knicks have now won five
and lost one when Ewing could not play at all. Van Gundy said this
fact has been ``manipulated'' by the news media, but it is a fact
nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   The trainers are working on Ewing's tendinitis for Game 5. The
few traveling Knicks fans will no doubt dispense medical, emotional
and strategic advice on Wednesday night in Indiana, too. &QL;

MERCKER VISITS ANGELS CLUBHOUSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND -- Pitcher Kent Mercker, who suffered a cerebral
hemorrhage May 11, visited the Angels clubhouse in Cleveland Monday
and plans to stay in town for the three-game series against the
Indians. He made the two-hour drive from his home in Dublin, Ohio
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You miss this part of it more than playing,'' Mercker said
while sitting in the clubhouse after the Angels' 3-2 win over the
Indians. ``Being around the guys, telling jokes, this is fun.

   ``You just assume when you're playing you can come to the
clubhouse every day and see the guys. When you're not allowed to
see them, being in the hospital for two weeks, you miss 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercker said some of his teammates didn't know quite how to
react to him, especially those who saw Mercker the night he had the
hemorrhage.
</P>
<P>
   ``They looked at me funny, like I'm going to fall down or
something,'' Mercker said. ``I try telling them nothing's wrong
with me. Everything's fine now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For a couple guys, the last time they saw him he was in the
clubhouse throwing up and his head was killing him,'' manager Mike
Scioscia. ``It was awesome to see him. To see him talking about
pitching, to see his mental outlook so good, there's no doubt in my
mind he's going to pitch again sometime.''
</P>
<P>
   Closer Troy Percival visited Mercker in the hospital almost
every day, picking up lunch from Mercker's favorite restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks great,'' Percival said. ``He's a huge part of this
team and we need him.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Jarrod Washburn had a no-hitter through five
innings Monday, but didn't make it out of the dugout for the sixth.
Washburn had felt tightness in his shoulder the past few days and
still felt it Monday, so Scioscia didn't want to take any chances
and took him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said 'How do you feel?' And I said 'The same,' and he said
'You're done,' '' Washburn said of Scioscia. ``I thought he was
joking, I laughed. But he's looking out for my best interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Washburn admitted he sat next to Scioscia in the top of the
sixth trying to convince him to let him go out for the bottom of
the sixth, but it didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to be an attorney because he lost his
argument,'' Scioscia said. ``As much as you want to win the
ballgame, you have to look at the big picture. We're looking at the
long-term impact we expect him to have on our pitching staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Washburn is expected to make his next start, Sunday vs. the
Dodgers at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Benji Gil went 0 for 4 Monday and is now hitless in 21
at-bats, his average dipping to .189. He hadn't driven in a run
since May 13, but he drove in two runs in separate at-bats Monday.
He grounded out to shortstop to score Scott Spiezio from third in
the third inning, and grounded into a fielder's choice to score
Troy Glaus from third in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   They were big runs because at that point, they were the only
runs of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to do something to help the team,'' Gil said.
``Whatever I can do, take a walk, bunt, drive in runs without a
hit. That's what my job calls for.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaus grounded into a double play in the second inning Monday,
the first double play he's hit into all season. Before Monday, he
led the league in at-bats without hitting into a double play (179).

THE FACE OF THE PACERS MIGHT NEED A LIFT NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Franchises go through changes. Crazy changes, evolutions,
transformations. Franchises renovate. Some change mascots; others
change logos and uniforms. Others, in an attempt to find higher
ground and deeper pockets, change cities.
</P>
<P>
   The Indiana Pacers have gone through fewer changes than most.
But now they need a facelift. Monday, a broken-down Knicks team _
one player with a broken bone in his foot, another with a sore knee
and Patrick Ewing out of the lineup _ outran and outhustled the
Pacers, who lost a crucial Game 4, 91-89. After the game, in a
tense losers' locker room, a couple of players were saying that
something had to change. Not heart. Not effort. None of the
subjective stuff writers like to write about. Tactics had to
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to find a way to get more easy baskets,'' Jalen Rose
said. ``We have to find a way to play a little quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether the Pacers could improve their running game,
Travis Best said: ``Yeah, we like to run more, but you have to get
stops. They were getting too many easy transition baskets.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers have been in Indiana since 1967 and, in their biggest
change, went from the American Basketball Association to the
National Basketball Association in 1976. Last year they tore down
one arena and moved into a new one.
</P>
<P>
   Now they appear to be at the crucial point of fundamental
renovation, and that will be even more evident if the Knicks come
back to win the Eastern Conference finals. Indiana had the Knicks
in a corner with a seemingly slim chance for escape: The Pacers won
the first two games, and the Knicks are hobbled with injuries.
Ewing didn't play Monday. Latrell Sprewell has a broken bone in his
foot. Marcus Camby has a sprained knee.
</P>
<P>
   The loss again raised questions. Are the Pacers tough enough to
finish off the Knicks? Who can be the source of the team's
fortitude? Is Reggie Miller Indiana's strength or merely a star
attraction?
</P>
<P>
   For 13 seasons the Pacers' face has been Miller, who will go
down as one of the deadliest outside shooters in NBA history. But
Miller, 34, has never carried his team to a championship, or even
the finals, and critics contemplating the Pacers' future are
wondering if he ever will. The Pacers are looking for a new face, a
new attitude. Will it be young Jonathan Bender? Young Al
Harrington? Maybe the Pacers are looking for Jalen Rose.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good group, a hard-working group,'' Donnie Walsh,
the Pacers' president, said Sunday. ``Unfortunately, in America
you're judged by winning championships.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers won their first ABA championship in 1970, when Miller
was 4. They won championships in 1972 and 1973, when Miller was 6
and 7. The Pacers' NBA cupboard is bare, but Miller's antics have
diverted attention from it. Miller has evolved from an
outside-shooting specialist to a bandanna-wrapped,
eye-patch-wearing bad guy, the trash talker who torments the Knicks
and their No. 1 fan, Spike Lee.
</P>
<P>
   On May 7, 1995, in one of the most dramatic finishes ever,
Miller scored 8 points in the final 18.7 seconds to beat the
Knicks, 107-105, in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals;
Indiana ultimately won the series. In 1998 he led the Pacers past
the Knicks, also in the conference semifinals, in five games.
</P>
<P>
   But the wide arc of his playoff history is a checkerboard of
great individual performances and four eliminations in the Eastern
Conference finals. Now the chances for this core of players, led by
Miller, are fading. All of Miller's antics _ the 3-point shooting,
the flopping around to draw fouls _ haven't been enough to catapult
Indiana into the championship round.
</P>
<P>
   It is Miller's misfortune at the twilight of his career to have
as his coach a former player whose reputation casts a shadow wide
enough to dwarf his own. Larry Bird was not only a deadly outside
shooter but a player who possessed unique basketball instincts _
and an instinct for winning _ that Miller seems to lack. You get
the sense sometimes that Bird can't understand why his team's
superstar can't carry them across the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Bird made a pointed reference to Miller's fading
act in the playoffs, after several occasions when Miller went
missing when the Pacers really needed him. He was missing in action
again on Saturday in Game 3, with Indiana trailing the depleted
Knicks, and Miller finished the game on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Some say Jalen Rose could be the new face in waiting. That is,
if he waits. Rose began to blossom last season and continued the
evolution this season. He has a tough veneer. He helped lead a
fourth-quarter rally Monday that got the Pacers back in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Rose may be the Pacers' new face. He may have to be.

SENATE BID IS LATEST GAMBLE FOR A WALL STREET ICONOCLAST 
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ When he surfaced 14 months ago as a contender
for the U.S. Senate, Jon S. Corzine seemed to have come out of
nowhere in a cloud of dust and dollar bills.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, 53, the former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., is
running solely on his record in business, but voters have been
given little information about that record. His opponent in the
Democratic primary on June 6, former Gov. Jim Florio, claims that
Corzine left a trail of financial victims around the globe. Corzine
defends himself but has revealed little else about his background;
he says he remains bound by an ironclad confidentiality agreement
and has refused to release his tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   But interviews with Corzine and his former colleagues suggest
that in his quarter-century at Goldman, Sachs, he was a bundle of
contradictions: a trader with a conscience, a capitalist icon with
a socialist streak as wide as Wall Street, the head of one of the
financial industry's most secretive and profitable institutions who
was so generous that, the story goes, if you so much as bumped into
him in the hall he practically begged you to take a $5,000 donation
to your favorite charity.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine followed one of the most humiliating exits in the
history of high finance _ in January 1999 he became only the second
chief executive to be ousted in the firm's 130-year history _ with
an audacious political conceit: despite giving hundreds of
thousands of dollars to Democratic candidates over the years, he
had never run for so much as the City Council in Summit, where he
lives, and remained unknown to all but a few New Jersey
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   But, like the steely bond trader he had been in the 1970s and
1980s, once he assessed the risks and decided on his course, he
threw everything he had into his campaign, including a
determination that borders on hardheadedness and a good portion of
his $400 million fortune.
</P>
<P>
   This much is certain: Corzine had been laying the groundwork for
a political career throughout his rise to power and ultimate
downfall at Goldman, Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Illinois, Corzine came to Goldman, Sachs in 1975
with a master's in business administration from the University of
Chicago and a year's experience as a bond trader in Ohio. He joined
Goldman's fixed-income department, a backwater that had never made
any money, which he calls a lucky opportunity. ``I was there as a
young bright guy and ended up making it successful,'' Corzine said,
``and much more important to the firm.''
</P>
<P>
   Janet Tiebout Hanson, who joined the department in 1977, said
Corzine inspired devotion among his troops by remaining calm even
during the most disastrous market meltdowns. ``He was soft-spoken,
but he wasn't wimpy,'' said Hanson, who spent 10 years working
three desks away from Corzine. She now runs her own
asset-management firm. ``I used to stand there and watch Jon do
half-billion-dollar transactions in a single trade. This was how
he, on a daily basis, earned the respect of traders. He didn't have
to yell, scream or throw things, like some other people did.''
</P>
<P>
   If Corzine had unusual ``people skills,'' it may have had
something to do with his ambitions beyond Wall Street. Robert E.
Rubin, the former treasury secretary who was co-chairman of Goldman
from 1990 until he joined the Clinton administration in 1993,
remembers Corzine confiding in him in the early 1980s that he
wanted to run for Congress someday. ``I was surprised,'' Rubin
said. ``Obviously, being a congressman is a very important thing,
but it's a very different thing.''
</P>
<P>
   As his department ballooned from 80 to nearly 2,000 people and
provided more and more of the firm's profits, Corzine shot up
through the ranks. He was made a partner in just five years and
given a seat on the all-powerful management committee in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   His performance during a nearly catastrophic episode in 1986
made his reputation and ``singled me out as a likely future
chairman,'' Corzine said. The crisis arose when Japanese holders of
one issue of government securities failed to adhere to custom and
exchange them for a newer issue, meaning that the price of the
older securities did not fall, as it ordinarily would have.
Goldman, like other Wall Street firms, had bet that the price would
drop, and when it did not the firm's paper losses quickly soared to
the hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were getting our tails kicked,'' he said. ``So I came out
of my office as a manager, rolled up my sleeves and went back to
trading.''
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that the situation would resolve itself in time, he
persuaded Goldman's leaders to hold fast, even as he traded nearly
round the clock to maintain the firm's ability to benefit from an
eventual turnabout. After five months, he was proven right. ``And
instead of losing hundreds of millions'' _ as other firms had _
``we ended up making an equivalent amount,'' Corzine said.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's rise culminated in 1994, when he was named to succeed
Stephen Friedman, the firm's senior partner, who resigned suddenly
after enduring seven months of heavy losses in bond trading.
``Trading had become such a big part of the business that Goldman
had to have someone who understood that business,'' said Lisa
Endlich, a former vice president who wrote a best-selling history
of the firm, ``Goldman Sachs: The Culture of Success.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the losses of tens of millions of dollars caused by
Goldman's traders had opened a deep rift between them and its
risk-averse investment bankers, Endlich said in an interview.
Corzine, she said, was a natural choice to put the pieces back
together. ``A more strident individual might not have been able to
heal those wounds,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Corzine was about as touchy-feely as they come
on Wall Street. In a forest of pinstripes and power ties, he had a
beard and wore sweater vests. In a world where rank, wealth and ego
are often interchangeable, he was chummy and sincere. ``He's always
somebody who would go out with his employees, sit and talk with
them, or drop by for a drink,'' Endlich said.
</P>
<P>
   He was also famously generous, writing checks to charities, no
questions asked, and stepping in to help those in need. When he
learned that a secretary who worked late every night was having
trouble paying her mortgage, for example, he took over the loan,
then helped pay her son's college tuition.
</P>
<P>
   He talked a Goldman messenger into going back to school and paid
his tuition, too, asking only to see the man's grades. His
financial disclosure form as a Senate candidate lists two personal
loans. One, for more than $500,000, was to the widow of a good
friend. Another, for more than $15,000, is to a schoolteacher who
moonlighted as a chauffeur and drove Corzine home every night.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, who had made Hanson the firm's first female sales
manager, showed his progressive bent as chairman by spurring
Goldman to recruit and promote blacks and women. And he expanded a
one-day-a-year volunteering program to the firm's offices
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   But his signal achievement was prodding Goldman, Sachs to go
public. The move, for which Corzine campaigned relentlessly,
eventually enriched everyone from partners to mailroom clerks, but
ultimately cost him his job.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Repeated attempts to make a stock offering over the decades had
failed. There was a generation gap, in that junior partners who had
smaller stakes in the firm would receive far less than older
partners. And many feared that the firm's insular, secretive
culture would be lost. But Corzine believed that the firm needed
the stability and flexibility that public ownership would bring.
</P>
<P>
   His colleagues say Corzine worked the halls of Goldman's
headquarters like a political pro, cajoling and gladhanding for
support. But his first attempt at a stock sale was a failure: In
1996, he brought the proposal to a partnership vote, but withdrew
it at the last minute when he realized that he had little support.
Some colleagues viewed this as a terrible blunder; others say it
was a master stroke, recalling that Corzine was given a standing
ovation, and that he won changes in the firm's management structure
that would help pave the way for an initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine made two more changes that proved costly. In 1998,
another year of heavy trading losses, he relinquished sole control
over Goldman; Hank Paulson, the firm's vice chairman who had long
resisted an IPO, was elevated to co-chairman and became a cautious
supporter of a stock sale. Another change Corzine made, this time
in the name of efficiency, was to pare down the executive committee
to just six members, including himself.
</P>
<P>
   But the shrunken committee led to his undoing: In January 1999,
a few months after one of Corzine's two closest allies on the
committee retired, Corzine was forced to step down as co-chief
executive by Paulson and the other two members. He kept the title
of co-chairman until the public offering was completed in May 1999,
when he resigned, taking with him 4.4 million shares of stock.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine said there were three ``conflict points'' between him
and the three other members of Goldman's executive committee: the
IPO itself, the firm's community philanthropy, and its
responsibilities to the financial system. He notes that while he
sought to carve out $500 million from the stock sale to endow a
charitable foundation, the amount was lowered to $200 million when
the firm finally went public in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But former colleagues say Corzine erred by behaving like the CEO
of a public company before Goldman had become one. The last straw
may have been his role in putting together a $3.6 billion bailout
of Long Term Capital Management, the hedge fund based in Greenwich,
Conn. In a matter of weeks beginning in August 1998, the fund lost
billions. Corzine and the heads of other firms, as well as the
president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, feared that a fire
sale of the fund's assets could take down several Wall Street
houses as well. Taking the lead, Corzine committed $300 million of
Goldman's money to the effort. Corzine viewed this as the firm's
responsibility to the financial industry. Others at Goldman, he
said, ``wanted to walk away.''
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's opponent in the Senate primary, Florio, has sought to
lay at Corzine's feet every controversial deal Goldman was involved
in during his years as a manager and chairman of the firm. And
Florio has had plenty to choose from: Goldman paid $253 million in
1995 to settle a lawsuit charging that it conspired with Robert
Maxwell, the British publishing magnate, to defraud pensioners,
rather than risking a jury verdict; in 1998, Goldman rushed into
Russia to raise more than $1 billion for that country's nascent
capitalists, pocketed huge fees, then stood by as bondholders were
left holding nearly worthless paper; and it remains indirectly
linked to two companies involved in a pipeline venture in Sudan, a
deal that critics say is funneling money to a government at war
with its own people.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine defends himself in each case, saying that he was an
early and outspoken advocate for the Maxwell settlement, and that
the firm's more controversial overseas activities nonetheless had
the blessing of the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   But he has done little to make his business background more
clear, resisting Florio's daily demands that he divulge his
personal income tax returns. And some of his answers have seemed
politically obtuse: He reacted to accusations about Goldman's
connections to gun makers by defending the need for the police and
the military to buy well-made weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In Corzine's eyes and in the eyes of his former colleagues, his
legacy has far more to do with his efforts to take Goldman public.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman he was an optimist, an idealist and an expansionist,
so much so that he provided his detractors in the top ranks of
Goldman with ammunition to use against him. By the time they acted
in January 1999, after a reprise of the trading losses of 1994,
Corzine had exhausted whatever political capital he had built up
with his fellow executive committee members.
</P>
<P>
   But Corzine said he retained the loyalty of the rank and file.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wanted to stand there and tear the firm apart, we
could've had a plebiscite to decide my fate,'' Corzine said. Such a
proceeding would have been highly unconventional, he conceded. ``I
didn't think it was in the best interests of the firm.''
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, Corzine said, he was able to close the books
on his career at Goldman knowing that he had accomplished his
principal goal.
</P>
<P>
   And if he had used up all his influence in doing so, Corzine
said, so what? ``Political capital, unused,'' he said, ``is
irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's to accomplish things. It's to get things done.''

   (NYT19) NEW YORK -- May 29, 2000 -- BKN-KNICKS-PACERS-2 -- The
New York Knicks beat the Indiana Pacers 91-89 at Madison Square
Garden on Monday in Game 4 of the NBA's Eastern Conference finals.

EDITORIAL: ANOTHER GAIN FOR IRISH PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, May 30:
</P>
<P>
   The ruling council of the Ulster Unionist Party in Northern
Ireland made a momentous and mature decision on Saturday when it
voted to resume participation in the government established by the
Good Friday peace accords. Britain had suspended the home-rule
government in February after only two months because the Irish
Republican Army refused to turn over any of its weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month the IRA offered instead to permit
international inspectors to verify that it had put some of its arms
caches out of service. The Unionist vote to accept this offer,
although by a narrow margin, shows that both Protestant and
Catholic leaders can make the compromises necessary for a lasting
peace.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was a tribute to the statesmanship of the Unionists'
leader, David Trimble, who has resumed his post as Northern
Ireland's first minister. Trimble spent the last week in an
energetic effort to convince his party not to abandon the peace
accords. Gerry Adams, who leads the IRA's political wing, Sinn
Fein, took the personal and political risks of pressing the IRA to
make its arms proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble's last hurdle turned out to have nothing to do with
disarmament. Unionists were furious that Britain had proposed
changing the name of Northern Ireland's police, the Royal Ulster
Constabulary, to the more neutral Northern Ireland Police Service.
The change was one of dozens of necessary reforms recommended by a
commission headed by Chris Patten, the former governor of Hong
Kong, that sought to make Northern Ireland's police more inclusive
and accountable. Currently, 93 percent of its members are
Protestant.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, cooled
Unionist passions by deleting mention of the name change from the
police bill now before the British Parliament and announcing that
other contentious symbolic issues would be decided later.
</P>
<P>
   That debate, however, obscures more serious problems with the
police bill. The Patten commission, for instance, wanted Catholics
to make up half of each new class of recruits for 10 years.
Mandelson's bill would cut the time period to three years. Patten
wanted a strong ombudsman and civilian oversight board that could
demand documents and investigate allegations against police.
Mandelson proposes much weaker versions of both these oversight
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament needs to make the police bill truer to the Patten
recommendations. A durable peace in Northern Island will require
not only the kind of political changes that are developing but also
a change in powerful institutions like the police.

DALLAS READILY ACCEPTS ROLE AS FAVORITE IN FINALS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Without false modesty or subtle
psychological manipulation, coach Ken Hitchcock verified on Monday
what most people already knew: that his Dallas Stars were expected
to beat the New Jersey Devils in the Stanley Cup finals, which
begin on Tuesday night in Continental Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should be the favorites because we're the defending
champions,'' Hitchcock said. But he quickly added that such an
evaluation can change as soon as these two unfamiliar teams play
the first period of their four-of-seven-games championship round.
</P>
<P>
   As both squads gathered for news conferences on a holiday
afternoon, coaches and players spoke carefully of rivals who, in
some respects, reflect each other in personnel, style and history.
</P>
<P>
   Both have won the trophy in recent seasons _ Dallas over Buffalo
last spring, the Devils over Detroit in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams survived seven-game conference finals this spring:
the Stars over Colorado in the West, the Devils over Philadelphia
in the East.
</P>
<P>
   Both captains are big defensemen _ Derian Hatcher of the Stars,
Scott Stevens of the Devils _ whose body-check totals far exceed
their scoring statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Both have top goalies in Ed Belfour of the Stars and Martin
Brodeur of the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   Because they met only twice this season _ with Dallas winning
both games, 2-1 and 3-2 _ it might take a while for these opponents
to figure each other out. Kirk Muller, a Stars veteran, noted that
both teams are coming off triumphs over close rivals and that it
might take time for the finals to reach the same level of
intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to get up for those games,'' Muller said of
rivalries within the conference. ``When you throw an Eastern and
Western team together, sometimes it takes a couple games to kind of
get that hate going again. But I don't think our team can afford
that. We don't have home-ice advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Joe Nieuwendyk, a Dallas center: ``Both teams are
very similar. Obviously, both goaltenders are solid. The defensemen
are big and physical. There's a lot of skilled forwards on both
teams. Both teams are almost a mirror image. It will be interesting
to see how it plays out.''
</P>
<P>
   But they are not so similar in the scoring forward roles.
Although the line of Jason Arnott, Patrik Elias and Petr Sykora
leads the Devils with 17 playoff goals, that total does not even
equal that of Dallas' Mike Modano and Brett Hull, who have combined
for 18.
</P>
<P>
   Both are older and more experienced than the Devils' snipers.
Hull scored five times in the seven games against Colorado. Last
season he scored the game-winner in overtime against Buffalo to
clinch the championship in Game 6 of the finals.
</P>
<P>
   Hull played that game with groin and knee injuries. Modano
played most of that series with a broken wrist. In the Colorado
series that ended last Saturday night, Modano left Game 6 after a
check by Adam Foote injured his leg and his head. He returned later
in that game and, in Game 7, scored a goal and an assist.
</P>
<P>
   Modano was once thought to be a soft player who did not compete
well against a physical challenge. Hull was said to be a fun-loving
person who lacked the dedication to play for a championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's always an ongoing battle with people's opinions
about how I play and how it's come full circle,'' Modano said.
``When I first came in the league, you have certain perceptions
people make about you. Those are hard to change. It's taken a long
time to do that. I have grown to enjoy the physical part of the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   It comes to him because teams think they can stop the Stars if
they stop Modano. So they hit him, often and hard. ``I just have to
deal with it and work through it,'' Modano said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Regarding the collision with Foote that sent him limping off the
ice, Modano said that he suffered a charley horse and that Foote's
stick ``kind of got me in the jaw a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a bit stunned,'' he said. ``I needed some time to get
off the ice and get regrouped.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull, who often tests the patience of his coaches, seems to have
a pleasantly edgy relationship with Hitchcock. They sparred orally
at the podium Monday. When asked if their relationship was a work
in progress, Hull said, ``I'm still working on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said of Hull: ``I like the music that he likes. I like
that he is great at crossword puzzles. We still pretty much
disagree on everything hockey-wise. He either plays my way or
doesn't go on the ice, and he knows that.'' Both men were smiling
as the coach said this.
</P>
<P>
   Some perceive that Hull has altered his attacking style a bit to
conform to the demands of Hitchcock's defensive approach. Stevens,
a Devil defenseman, played with Hull for one season in St. Louis
and noticed a difference in a recent game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him the other day trying to block a shot, which I had
never seen him do before,'' Stevens said. ``He is playing more of a
team game. Probably being in Dallas a lot has rubbed off on him.
But obviously he is still very good at scoring and he is having his
best playoffs yet. We have to keep a close eye on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Stars and their coach said pointedly that hockey teams
gain special recognition not by winning just one championship but
by repeating the next season. Detroit did it in 1997 and 1998;
Pittsburgh did it in 1991 and 1992; Edmonton won five times in
seven seasons from 1984 through 1990, but never more than twice in
succession. The last team to do better was the Islanders, winning
four in a row from 1980 through 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a certain status that goes with teams that have won
two cups, especially two in a row,'' Hitchcock said. ``And we want
that status badly.''

GATEWAY AND AOL BYPASS STALWARTS ON COMPONENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Breaking ranks with the powerful ``Wintel
duopoly,'' based on Intel hardware and Microsoft software, Gateway
and America Online plan to announce on Tuesday that they will use a
processor from an upstart Silicon Valley chip maker and a version
of the Linux operating system in a new Internet home appliance
scheduled to go on sale later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is a big victory for Transmeta Corp., a chip design
company in Santa Clara that has developed a microprocessor intended
to be a low-power and inexpensive alternative to Intel's
microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   Transmeta was founded five years ago by David Ditzel, the former
Sun Microsystems hardware designer, with backing from George Soros,
the financier; Paul Allen, the Microsoft co-founder; Deutsche Bank;
and others. It said last month that it had raised an additional $88
million in financing from Compaq Computer, Gateway, Samsung, Sony
and a number of Taiwanese manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is a portent of the arrival of what is being popularly
referred to as the post-PC computing era, a world in which the
personal computer is displaced by an expanding array of digital
cellular phones, personal digital assistants, Webpads _ which are
tablet-style computers _ and other appliancelike devices.
</P>
<P>
   Both Intel and Microsoft have largely resisted this vision,
maintaining instead that the PC will remain at the center of the
computing world for many years and that the new devices will
function more or less as peripherals to a central PC.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway executives on Friday said they had decided to break with
Intel and Microsoft because the new devices were not personal
computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not building a personal computer, we're building an
appliance,'' said Peter Ashkin, Gateway's senior vice president and
chief technology officer. ``Hence, there was no strong requirement
for Windows.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashkin said the choice of the Transmeta chip was appropriate to
the new devices, which are intended to be placed on a kitchen
counter or a desk and eventually to be carried around the home as
wireless Webpads always connected to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Ashkin said Transmeta turned out to be an excellent choice.
``Their chip offered a unique combination of low power and low
cost,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many executives in the computer industry believe that the next
generation of computing will bring fresh opportunities for
competitors like Transmeta to offer alternatives to the dominant
industry powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Microsoft off the desktop, and Intel out from inside
the desktop,'' said Robert Enderle, a market researcher who is vice
president for desktop and mobile technologies at Giga Information
Group.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge to the Wintel monopoly is a replay of an earlier
skirmish that became one of the central points of contention in the
Microsoft antitrust trial last year.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, a Gateway executive, James Von Holle, served
as a witness for the Justice Department and described how Microsoft
had put pressure on Gateway after it pursued a strategy of
installing the Netscape browser and placing an AOL icon on the
desktop of its computers.
</P>
<P>
   Now both America Online and Gateway have potentially found a way
to displace Microsoft's software entirely by using a special
version of the free Linux operating system that will run the
Netscape browser customized for each company's online service.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are definitely willing to take more risks today,''
Ditzel said. ``The truth is that the phrase `Internet appliance'
has become a code word in the industry meaning `no Windows.'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In addition to the Internet appliance market, Transmeta is
trying to push into the market for portable computers. The first
portables based on the Transmeta chips are likely to be announced
next month at the PC Expo computer trade show in New York, Ditzel
said.
</P>
<P>
   Transmeta gained significant visibility in January when after
five years as a secret design laboratory, it announced two new
chips that were compatible with Intel's X86 design, which includes
the Pentium chips, yet consumed only about one watt of power _ much
more efficient than Intel's.
</P>
<P>
   The company's microprocessors use a novel Very Long Instruction
Word, or VLIW, processing approach that is an attempt to simplify
computing hardware by shifting many functions to software.
</P>
<P>
   Intel has since shown a technology demonstration of one of its
chips consuming only about a watt of power. Many analysts, however,
doubt that the chip-making giant can push aggressively into the
low-power market without harming its other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Transmeta garnered a great deal of attention when it
hired Linus Torvalds, a Finnish programmer who created and led the
open-source effort to develop the Linux operating system as a free
alternative to Microsoft's and other operating-system programs.
</P>
<P>
   Ditzel said on Friday that Torvalds had led an effort to modify
Linux to run without a hard disk to make it usable by inexpensive
consumer appliances. Gateway executives said on Friday that the
first ``tethered'' version of the new Internet appliance would go
on sale during the fourth quarter and that wireless versions would
be available in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway will sell the machines through its network of 260 retail
stores, while America Online will market them directly to its
subscribers. Neither company is certain about the final price of
the product, which is aimed at below $500.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a place up on my wall where people come in and
scribble numbers between $99 and $499,'' Ashkin said.

IMUS PRODUCER MCGUIRK DISMISSES `HUMOR GESTOPO' 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBIN FINN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This gab session with Bernard McGuirk, one of New
York talk radio's hairraising personalities working with shock jock
Don Imus, is conducted inside a claustrophobic bunker-like studio
at WFAN and begins with his own vocal binge-and-purge session.
</P>
<P>
   McGuirk, for 13 years the producer of the wildly _ make that
wickedly _ popular ``Imus in the Morning,'' says its purpose is to
get the expletives out of the way sooner so he can be more
articulate later.
</P>
<P>
   You go, guy. After all, you've been up swilling caffeine since
3:45 a.m. and spilling insults on the air since 5.
</P>
<P>
   So the tape recorder is switched off and McGuirk, shrieking like
an X-rated Richard Simmons in front of a transfixed class of two _
a reporter and a photographer _ gets the nasties out of his system.
And he has significant fun, apparently, expelling them before
smoothing his dress-down-Friday chinos and settling into a squeaky
executive chair from which, between PG-rated answers, he
alternately yanks at and shoves away his microphone like a toddler
confronting a spoonful of vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, McGuirk, who calls Imus his lord, master and
mentor, and happily submits to being labeled ``a bald-headed
stooge'' by the boss in return for being permitted to pay that
homage, was once an altar boy back in the South Bronx _ and wore a
jacket and tie to Cardinal Hayes High School. Easier to believe,
perhaps, is an anecdote about how the producer's mother used to
routinely scrub out his mouth with soap when she caught him
uttering forbidden epithets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it happened to everybody,'' McGuirk says, noting
that it hasn't happened yet to his own children, 7 and 4, but
adding that he'll be armed and ready if verbal insurrection invades
their Lido Beach, N.Y., household. ``And I won't be using wimpy
soap, either. No Irish Spring,'' sneers McGuirk, whose strict Irish
immigrant parents ``came off the boat with barely two nickels to
rub together.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, other authority figures, CBS new correspondent Mike
Wallace among them, have suggested that the mouthy McGuirk, now 39
and coaching Little League in suburbia in his spare time, has again
qualified for the soap treatment despite his age. Only this time
McGuirk's alleged transgression is bigotry, not blasphemy.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently unsettled by McGuirk's irreverent parodies of black
sports stars _ notably the New Jersey Nets' Jayson Williams _ and
McGuirk's embellishments to Imus' periodically toxic diatribes,
Wallace charged publicly that McGuirk ``glories in the role of
resident bigot'' on the program, and an online opinion journal
recently seconded the assault.
</P>
<P>
   McGuirk, who describes himself and Imus as equal opportunity
satirists and their subjects as fair game for verbal evisceration,
begs to differ. He mutters that a defanged and declawed Imus show
would pack all the punch of National Public Radio and alienate Imus
listeners: ``They don't want to hear nice guys: Nice guys are a
dime a dozen.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that he thinks of his humor as mean, he said, just cynical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't glory in anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like the times he refers to the New York Knicks, his least
favorite NBA team, as chest-bumping pimps, perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's meant to be descriptive, not pejorative. If the NBA were
peopled by a bunch of Romanians, we'd be making fun of Romanians.
To not satirize someone just because of their race, I think that
would be patronizing and racist in itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there's thesis fodder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, I'm not a bigot,'' said McGuirk, who said
he put himself through the College of Mount St. Vincent in
Riverdale by driving a cab, after his father, a city bus driver,
kicked McGuirk out when he was 18. He earned ``a fluff degree'' in
communications, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived amongst blacks all my life,'' he says of his childhood
in the James Monroe Houses, where, he said, white Irish boys were a
minority. ``I lived in Long Beach in a co-op where the directory
read like Schindler's List, for crying out loud. Yes, I arrive at
the studio at 5 a.m. each day, but before I do, on my way out I
shine my lawn jockeys, and then I stop at the cemetery and knock
over Jewish tombstones. Oh, please.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Wallace, he says: ``People can be so humorless: That's what
Mike Wallace is, part of the humor Gestapo. The humor Gestapo _
hey, I like that.''
</P>
<P>
   McGuirk says he and Imus, who hired him at WNBC in 1987, police
themselves on what is and isn't offensive . Here is what McGuirk
said they consider off-limits: ``Overt racism, making fun of
cripples or people with cancer, Christopher Reeve jokes . . .
there's definitely a line.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that McGuirk set out to become a wise guy in what he calls
Imus' Greek Chorus of sycophants and lackeys. He said he just
didn't want to spend his life driving a taxi. After being thrown
out by his dad in a rift that lasted a decade, McGuirk said he
spent four years with ``hoodlums,'' entered college at 22, and had
an internship at NBC where, on his first day, Imus made a lasting
impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a big drug and alcohol problem then, and he was running
around the station in his boxer underwear screaming and cursing at
the top of lungs,'' McGuirk recalls. ``And of course I thought,
`that's the man I want to spend the next 20 years with.'''

BUSS: `A FAIRY TALE SEASON'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jerry Buss tonight will be sitting in his B level
luxury box suite at Staples Center, peering nervously down at a
garish spectacle he helped create.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the Lakers will be flanked by his designated date
for the evening, for sure to be a skimpily attired woman barely out
of her teens. Seated behind him will be his top Laker adviser,
Jerry West. Seated around him will be an eclectic cluster of
people---team sponsors, old friends, millionaire tycoons,
professional hangers-on and at least five or six striking ladies
limoed straight from Hef's (that's Hugh Hefner to those not hip)
Playboy mansion.
</P>
<P>
   With several aides always nearby to cater to his every need and
whim, Buss cuts the royal figure of a potentate, with the vast new
downtown arena being his principality.
</P>
<P>
   A strong case can be made that Buss, whose team can qualify for
the NBA finals tonight by beating the Portland Trail Blazers, is
the greatest athletic proprietor in Los Angeles history, although
I'm sure Walter O'Malley advocates would offer a stern dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Since Buss took control of the Lakers in 1979, the team has won
five world championships and become one of the most glamorous
franchises on the American sporting landscape.
</P>
<P>
   During his watch, the Lakers have posted the best regular season
record in the NBA in winning more than 67 percent (1143-547) of
their games in a glowing tribute to Buss' deft administrative
touch.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a Peter O'Malley, Buss never has been shy about spending
huge chunks of money to sign a high-profile superstar the ilk of a
Shaquille O'Neal. Unlike a Donald Sterling or Georgia Frontiere, he
never has turned his team into comedic canon fodder for late-night
TV hosts. Unlike an Al Davis, he has not become smitten with
himself from his team's success and become prone to making
disastrous decisions because of obstinacy spawned by an
uncontrollable ego.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry West,'' Jerry Buss says simply when you ask him the
reason for the Lakers' dominance across the seasons. ``He has been
responsible for putting together our teams. I don't think there's
ever been a greater judge of basketball personnel than Jerry. It's
incredible how he's been able to come with good players in the
draft even though we've usually always been picking in the late
rounds.''
</P>
<P>
   This is true, but Jerry Buss also hasn't for the most part
interfered with West, an unusual development in an era when so many
of those in control of sports franchises meddle disastrously, as
the Fox bumblers did with the Dodgers in their bizarre
excommunication of Mike Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Buss did a couple years ago prevent West from acquiring the
All Star shooting guard, Mitch Richmond, but he has green lighted
West on most other moves, including the off-season luring of Phil
Jackson out of retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This so far has been a fairy tale season for us, and I think
you have to give a lot of the credit to Phil Jackson,'' says Buss.
``I honestly thought it would take Phil three or four years before
we reached the level we have this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just look what he's done with this team. Shaq is a different
player, and wins the MVP trophy. Kobe (Bryant) is a different
player, and no one is laughing anymore when people say he could
become another Michael (Jordan). The Lakers have evolved into a
different team under Phil. They have a cohesiveness and motivation
that was lacking before, and I think you can attribute such a
change to Phil's coaching. He's done just a great, great job.''
</P>
<P>
   At halftime at a recent playoff game, I met Buss in his suite,
and we walked down a nearby stairway to the Staples Center's cigar
room, where Buss dragged on a cigarette as I asked him questions.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, he was accompanied by an attractive, young female,
who happens to be a waitress at a Seal Beach tavern that has the
same name as that of the former Dodger ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Buss is now in his mid 60s, but he seems to me to be as
energetic as when I first interviewed 21 years ago a few days after
he had bought the Lakers, Kings, Forum and a 13,000-acre Kern
County ranch from Jack Kent Cooke for $67.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Buss was a wealthy man then, but he's a lot wealthier now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I can sell the Lakers tomorrow for more than $500
million,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you miss the Forum?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Forum had a great charisma and tradition about it,'' he
replied ``I have some great memories there. Staples Center is
totally different. I think it has taken the fans awhile to adjust
to the change. It's so much larger. But I've noticed in the last
month or two how the place has started to become much louder and
how the fans seem to now really be enjoying it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you enjoying these Lakers as much as you did the Magic
Johnson-Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Showtime Lakers?'' I wondered.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a completely different type of team,'' he said. ``The
Showtime teams liked to fast break, and score quickly. This Laker
team has a set-up type of offense. I never thought I'd enjoy a
half-court game, but I'm certainly enjoying these Lakers.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Buss' bank account also is flourishing.
</P>
<P>
   It's estimated the Lakers could gross up to $150 million this
season, with perhaps a third of that winding up in Buss' private
coffers.
</P>
<P>
   While corporate conglomerates have taken over many athletic
franchises, they apparently soon won't be assuming control of the
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm never going to give up control of the Lakers,'' said West.
``They're my passion. And I'm enjoying all this too much. If our
key players stay healthy, we figure to have a lot more seasons of
fun.''

<P>
   Pilots at beleaguered Korean Air have voted to go on strike
Wednesday if the South Korean government and the airline do not
recognize their union.
</P>
<P>
   A strike would further damage the credibility of South Korea's
national airline, which flies to four East Coast destinations. Last
year, safety concerns prompted Delta Air Lines to suspend a
code-sharing arrangement with Korean Air.
</P>
<P>
   Korean Air has expanded rapidly over the last three decades,
from an eight-plane local carrier to the world's 13th-largest
airline. But its reputation has been tarnished by several fatal
accidents in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   One was the 1997 crash of a Boeing 747 that was trying to land
in Guam, an accident that killed 228 people. Another was the 1999
crash of an MD-11 cargo plane as it took off from Shanghai, China;
that accident killed all three crew members, and about 40 people on
the ground were killed or injured.
</P>
<P>
   The airline has spent more than $100 million on safety training,
hiring Americans to run its safety program. But aviation
specialists say Korean Air has been hampered by a system in which
many junior crew members don't feel free to challenge or question
the actions of superior officers.
</P>
<P>
   An internal Korean Air survey of pilots in 1998 found cases of a
captain hitting a first officer for making mistakes, and of crew
members failing to discuss the expected weather or the amount of
fuel necessary for a journey because the captain alone was
responsible for such decisions.
</P>
<P>
   A strike would devastate the airline financially, with losses of
about $11 million a day, and further weaken consumer confidence,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government doesn't want to mar Korea's image by having its
national carrier grounded,'' said Lim Dong Soo, an airline analyst
at Nomura Securities in Seoul. ``Plus, Korean Air will suffer
considerable losses if their planes don't take off. The pressure
will be on all parties involved to avoid a strike.''
</P>
<P>
   Korean Air has three nonstop flights a week from Seoul to
Boston, using Boeing 747-400 aircraft, according to the
Massachusetts Port Authority, which owns and operates Logan.
</P>
<P>
   The flights, which arrive on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday,
return to Seoul via Dulles International Airport near Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean Air Pilots Union said 1,128 of 1,247 union pilot
members have voted to go on a strike that's scheduled to begin
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the government refuses to recognize our union by 6 p.m. May
30, we have no choice but to strike as of 6 a.m. on Wednesday,''
said Ha Hyo Youl, a spokesman for the union.
</P>
<P>
   The airline, in an attempt to placate the pilots, filed an
application with the government to end the pilots' civil service
status, which has been a major stumbling block to the pilots' union
recognition. Under Korean law, civil servants cannot unionize.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have done everything that we can legally do to avoid a
strike,'' said Yonni Woo, a Korean Air spokeswoman. ``We have a
channel of dialogue with the union that is open 24 hours a day. But
now, when all is said and done, it's up to the government to
recognize the union.''

EDITORIAL: A GIFT FOR THE CREDIT CARD INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, May 30:
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans had a decent impulse in seeking to
tighten bankruptcy laws because filings were soaring and cheats
were seeking bankruptcy to evade creditors. But the kernel of good
purpose has now mushroomed into House and Senate bills stuffed with
gifts to the credit card industry, which has gained leverage in
Congress through millions of dollars in campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are now putting together a proposal that would
combine elements from each bill. It would impose a rigid means test
for determining which petitioners could afford to repay creditors,
thereby stripping judges of discretion to weigh individual cases.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to force more petitioners to file under Chapter 13,
which could require them to repay creditors at least $170 a month
for up to five years. Fewer petitioners would be allowed to file
under Chapter 7, which wipes away most debts.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal contains a few constructive ideas. It would
partially override laws in states that allow debtors to hold onto
their homes no matter how much they are worth, though the
Republicans threaten to build in loopholes. It would also put a
million-dollar cap on individual retirement accounts that debtors
could keep out of the reach of creditors.
</P>
<P>
   But the overwhelming impact would be to hurt unsophisticated
debtors and go easy on the well-heeled. The proposal fails to
override state laws that allow debtors to lock away millions in
trust, a huge benefit to the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it would make debtors repay more of their credit card debt
after they emerge from bankruptcy, forcing those on modest incomes
to put repayment to credit card companies in competition with
paying for child care. The provisions on repaying loans would force
many more people to lose vehicles needed for work.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would also make bankruptcy procedures needlessly
expensive and complicated. Yet it would do little to rein in credit
card companies _ not even forcing them to disclose on the monthly
statement how long the cardholders would need to repay loans if
they pay only the minimum due.
</P>
<P>
   Drastic measures might be justified if cheating were rampant. It
is not. A prominent study estimated that less than 4 percent of
petitioners can afford to pay creditors.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Sens. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota and Patrick Leahy of
Vermont, both Democrats, have scuttled Republican efforts to attach
the proposal onto unrelated legislation where critics would get
little opportunity to amend its punitive provisions. They have
received only timid support from the White House. If President
Clinton displayed some anger, perhaps he could sidetrack the worst
features before they wind up on his desk.

DANCE CENTER FOUNDER EDELE HOLTZ, 82, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edele Nielsen Holtz, who helped create the Clark Center for the
Performing Arts in Manhattan and played an important role in Alvin
Ailey's early career, died on May 20 at the Asheville Health Care
Facility in Swannanoa, N.C. She was 82 and lived in Swannanoa.
</P>
<P>
   Holtz and her husband, Alwin, who died last year, became friends
with Ailey in the early 1960s when a colleague of the young
choreographer approached Holtz about rehearsal space at a new
branch of the Young Women's Christian Association on Eighth Avenue
and 53rd Street in Manhattan, where she was director of activities.
</P>
<P>
   Holtz, a peppery, no-nonsense social worker, agreed and
eventually set up programs to benefit dancers, musicians and actors
working in the theater district. Many of the programs, including a
series of workshop performances for new choreographers, were
suggested by Ailey. The performances were presented at Clark
Center, a theater carved out of space that had been a hotel
ballroom. The series provided crucial exposure for young
choreographers who came of age artistically in the 1960s, '70s and
'80s.
</P>
<P>
   Holtz and her husband came to New York after working in refugee
and education programs in the Middle East for 10 years, beginning
in 1948 as field staff members of the United Nations-Quaker Project
for Palestinian Refugees in Gaza. The experience served them well
in helping Ailey as much-needed surrogate parents and de facto
booking agents and accountants in the tumultuous early days of
Ailey's company.
</P>
<P>
   During her long career with the YWCA, Holtz was also the
executive director of branches in Brooklyn and New Orleans and was
a staff member of the group's national board.
</P>
<P>
   Holtz is survived by two sisters, Greta Rikard of Salem, Va.,
and Inga Hoffman of Santa Cruz, Calif.

 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
The Comets on Memorial Day hosted what is becoming an annual
celebration at Compaq Center.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was an emotional affair during which the Comets hung a third
straight championship banner from the rafters and got their third
set of championship rings. And the butterflies that danced in their
stomachs kept fluttering well into a sluggishly played first half
as they battled the New York Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, the result was similar to nine months before,
when the Comets beat the Liberty in the WNBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Cooper scored the 2,000th point of her WNBA career,
Sheryl Swoopes produced a game-high 27 points, and Tina Thompson
added 15 as the Comets beat the Liberty 84-68 in their season
opener.
</P>
<P>
   Teresa Weatherspoon, who beat the Comets in Game 2 of last
year's Finals with a miracle shot, passed out a game-high 13
assists. But this day, there would be no party-bashing from the
two-time WNBA Defensive Player of the Year, despite the Liberty's
fighting back from a 15-point second-half deficit to close within
six points.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I was a little concerned,'' said Swoopes, who sat
out almost five minutes of the second half because of leg cramps.
``But never in my mind did I think we were going to lose. I think
that's because of the players we have on this team. We're so
confident in ourselves and in each other that we're going to do
whatever it takes to win.''
</P>
<P>
   A sellout crowd of 16,285 watched the Comets miss seven of their
first eight shots, play catch-up for 13 minutes, then come roaring
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we played the way we wanted to play, definitely
not for 40 minutes,'' said Swoopes, who missed her first 3-point
attempt, then rattled in her next four while shooting 8-for-17
overall. ``We know we have a lot of work to do. But the good thing
is it was the first game of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   When these two teams, involved in one of the hotter rivalries in
the WNBA, met in last year's championship, Weatherspoon's 52-foot
last-second bomb in the second game of the series forced a third
and deciding game. The Comets roared out of the blocks in Game 3,
faltered only slightly, then sprinted to a 59-47 victory to earn
their third WNBA title.
</P>
<P>
   They had accomplished their mission _ to pay homage to point
guard Kim Perrot, who had died of cancer two weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The Perrot influence was still very much in evidence Monday.
Near the top of the 1999 championship banner was the inscription,
``No. 3 for No. 10,'' a reference to Perrot's jersey number. That
same notation is on one side of the championship rings.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I walked out (to receive a ring), I don't know why, but
it just made me break down when I saw the `No. 3 for No. 10,'''
said Comets coach Van Chancellor. ``I'm emotionally drained right
now. I know they (the players) have got to be drained. You come out
here, (and) you relive that situation one more time. I wore my
ring, and just looking at it, yeah, I was kind of misty-eyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the ceremonies drained us a little bit. And then I
thought we were overanxious, trying to do good, look good in front
of all these people. Once we settled down, we played really good.''
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of the early shooting woes _ and the brilliant
play of New York's Sue Wicks (14 points, six rebounds) and Tamika
Whitmore (a team-high 15 points) _ the Comets trailed 19-13 with
9:04 left until halftime.
</P>
<P>
   But a pair of free throws by Swoopes tied the score at 21, and
her 3-pointer a minute later gave them the lead for good at 24-23.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first trey of the game for the Comets, who were
0-for-7 from long range to that point. But it was not the most
significant.
</P>
<P>
   That came from Cooper with 13:29 to go in the second half,
putting the three-time league scoring champ at the 2,000-point mark
while extending the Comets' lead to 56-44.
</P>
<P>
   What problems may have existed on offense earlier seemed to have
vanished completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just weren't flowing (earlier),'' said Thompson, who
finished with six assists and four rebounds. ``I can't put my
finger on why. It probably had to do with the ceremonies. But we
got over it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Comets used five straight points by Cooper to go up 66-50
with 10:28 left. But following a pair of free throws by the
37-year-old shooting guard, the Comets went scoreless for 4:54.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty scored 10 straight points and pulled within 66-60 on
a 3-pointer by Becky Hammon.
</P>
<P>
   Weatherspoon was on the bench when the Liberty made its
comeback. She re-entered the fray a short time later but was unable
to ignite a rally. A closing 13-5 run in the final 3:20 sealed the
deal for the Comets.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end, we definitely pulled it together,'' said Thompson.
``We were stopping them defensively. We were getting shots and
hitting free throws.''

FLORIDA TOWN HOLDS MEMORIAL FOR SLAIN TEACHER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to add 6 grafs at end of story)  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE WORTH, Fla. _ After a long weekend of mourning, more than a
thousand residents of this small town gathered at a rally on Monday
to call for an end to violence and to remember a popular teacher
slain on Friday by a seventh grader.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors, family and students of the teacher, Barry Grunow, 35,
held hands and encircled Bryant Park here to remember the teacher.
They prayed and talked about ways to prevent yet another school
shooting. The slogan of the rally, held aloft on banners and
printed on T-shirts was ``stop the violence and nurture the
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people wore yellow ribbons around their arms and carried
signs reading slogans like ``Love your children, Lock your guns.''
Residents called on lawmakers to take gun control more seriously.
If violence could happen in their tiny community, they said, it
could happen anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad part is it keeps happening,'' said Barbara Lynch, who
has lived in Lake Worth for 15 years. ``It happened to a lovely
man, to a community man.''
</P>
<P>
   As many current and former students cried and embraced each
other at the rally, they spoke about Grunow's gentle nature They
said the teacher used to lovingly tease his students, reward them
with cookies and doughnuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the kind of teacher you'll never forget because he
believed in hands-on learning,'' said Crystal Bruder, 16, a former
student. ``When we were studying Greek mythology in class, he'd
have us all dress up, and he made me dress up as a tree for
scenery. His lessons were unforgettable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Learning with him was fun,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But students said they would remember Grunow mostly as a friend,
a teacher who tried to be approachable.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of my friends would go to him when they had problems,''
said Amber Hart, 12, a student of Grunow's. ``We felt comfortable
talking to him. He was so nice. I don't understand why this
happened to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Amber said she also knew 13-year-old Nathaniel Brazill, who is
being held in the death of Grunow.
</P>
<P>
   The boy had been sent home from school on Friday, the last day
of school before summer, for throwing water balloons. According to
police, he returned two hours later with a handgun and shot Grunow
once in the head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nate was in my advanced math class,'' she said. ``He's a nice
boy. I don't know why he did that to Mr. Grunow. It's all so
confusing.''
</P>
<P>
   The police said on Monday that two boys had told them that
Nathaniel showed them a gun at his home on May 23, said Lt. Raychel
Houston, a spokeswoman for the Lake Worth Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, while searching Nathaniel's room, the police found
computer games and magazines featuring helicopters and guns, which
suggested that Nathaniel was interested in weapons and the
military, Houston said.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney Barry Krischer said he would call for a grand
jury this week to consider the boy's case. ``It is my intent to try
him as an adult,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Helaine Rayman, a Lake Worth resident who organized Monday's
rally, said the solution to school shootings like the one at Lake
Worth Middle School was simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's start listening to our children,'' she said. ``Let's be
there for them and nurture them like we are supposed to.''
</P>
<P>
   Grunow, who was married with two young children, will be buried
here on Tuesday morning.

`WONDERFUL MISSION' FOR SPACE SHUTTLE ATLANTIS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) Gliding through darkness, the shuttle Atlantis and its
seven astronauts touched down in Florida early Monday, bringing
their successful space station repair mission to a close.
</P>
<P>
   With commander Jim Halsell and pilot Scott ``Doc'' Horowitz at
the controls, Atlantis rolled to a landing at NASA's Kennedy Space
Center at 1:20 a.m. CDT.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's bad hours for the arrival, but we are certainly
glad to be back home,'' Halsell told space agency dignitaries and
ground control teams that assembled on the runway. ``Thanks for the
ride uphill and downhill.''
</P>
<P>
   Wind gusts, which had threatened to postpone the landing,
diminished to well within NASA's stringent limits for a nighttime
landing. The five-man, two-woman crew arrived in darkness for only
the 14th time in 98 shuttle missions that date back to 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Halsell, Horowitz, flight engineer Jeff Williams, mission
specialists Jim Voss, Susan Helms, Mary Ellen Weber and Russian
cosmonaut Yuri Usachev spent Memorial Day in Florida undergoing
routine medical exams, resting and celebrating the holiday with
close family members.
</P>
<P>
   They are scheduled to return to Houston Tuesday. NASA's Johnson
Space Center plans a brief public welcoming ceremony at Ellington
Field in Clear Lake about 1:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-day mission proved a much needed shot in the arm for the
U.S.-led, 16-nation international space station program.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly efforts have been stalled primarily by Russian economic
and rocket problems since the first two components were joined in
Earth orbit in December 1998. As a result of the shuttle crew's
efforts, the yet-to-be-inhabited station is poised to receive the
long overdue Russian crew module.
</P>
<P>
   The astronauts overhauled a power-generation system faltering
because of the delays, revived the communications system, enhanced
the ventilation and fire-detection systems and boosted the
station's altitude by nearly 30 miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a wonderful mission. Everything worked just right,''
said Ron Dittemore, NASA's shuttle program manager.
</P>
<P>
   The big crew module is slated for a July launch by the Russians.
Those plans are contingent, though, on a pair of successful test
flights of the module's Proton launcher.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantis returned in good mechanical shape, though its
protective exterior was scared by ice fragments from the May 19
liftoff.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantis is tentatively scheduled to lift off again in early
September, which will require a rapid turnaround by ground crews.
Atlantis will haul supplies and equipment for the crew module on
its next mission.

THE DEVILS TAKE STOCK, AND LIKE THEIR CHANCES 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ From coach Larry Robinson down to the
fourth-line players, the New Jersey Devils said Monday that they
match up well with the Dallas Stars and are confident they can
defeat the defending champions in the Stanley Cup finals, which
begin here Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team grew together so much in the last series,'' Randy
McKay said of the Devils. ``It has given us so much confidence that
we believe we can accomplish anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils don't seem upset by observers who believe that Dallas
will successfully defend its cup. Perhaps those opinions were based
on the fact that Western Conference teams had captured the cup the
past four years.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have an abundance of experienced players, including
three former Montreal captains in Guy Carbonneau, Kirk Muller and
Mike Keane. And the Stars have snipers like Brett Hull, Mike Modano
and Joe Nieuwendyk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these teams are closely matched, and it will probably
come down to the special teams,'' Robinson said. ``Both teams are
built along the same lines believing that the game should be played
a certain way. I think it'll be an exciting series.''
</P>
<P>
   As he did in the previous rounds against the top lines of
Florida, Toronto and Philadelphia, Robinson will most likely use
his top line of Patrik Elias, Jason Arnott and Petr Sykora to
counter the Stars' scoring line of Modano, Hull and Nieuwendyk.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a few great players on their team that can rip the
puck in,'' Elias said, referring to Modano's line. ``We just got to
play smart when we're up against these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson also said he would be using the defensive tandem of
Scott Stevens and Brian Rafalski against the Modano line. That
pairing helped contain Florida's Pavel Bure, Toronto's Mats Sundin
and Philadelphia's top line in the first three rounds of the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens has been the Devils' most dominant player in the
postseason. He has a number of memorable playoff hits, like the one
on Slava Kozlov against Detroit in 1995, when the Devils captured
the cup. His latest one may have ended the career of Philadelphia's
Eric Lindros.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Stevens, the Devils will counter Dallas' snipers and
experience with youth and exuberance. The Devils also have more
balanced scoring. While the Stars do not have a player with more
than two goals after Modano and Hull (with nine each) and
Nieuwendyk (with six), the Devils have six players with three or
more goals from players not on the top line, which has produced 17.
</P>
<P>
   Elias leads the Devils with seven goals in the playoffs, Sykora
has six, and Arnott, Claude Lemieux, Scott Gomez and Scott
Niedermayer have four. Bobby Holik, Alexander Mogilny and Sergei
Nemchinov have three apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more balance and we have commitment,'' said John
Madden, a defensive specialist, who has two goals in the playoffs
despite missing three games in the previous round because of an
injury to his right knee. ``All I can say is that we've challenged
some people in these playoffs, and we'll continue to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've come together as a team. It's a great feeling to
look around and see that the next guy is as committed as you are.''
</P>
<P>
   One of four rookies on the Devils _ Gomez, Rafalski and Colin
White are the others _ Madden said he was impressed by the way all
the players on the Devils had committed themselves to Robinson's
system and philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so hard to get that at the pro level,'' Madden said,
``because there are so many egos involved. That's why I believe in
this team.''

SPARKS GET DEFENSIVE WITH COOPER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If you want to play for Michael Cooper, the name
of the game is defense.
</P>
<P>
   The former Laker star of the Showtime era made a name for
himself, guarding some of the NBA's best offensive players, notably
former Boston Celtics legend Larry Bird, now coach of the Indiana
Pacers, Walter Davis, George Gervin, Dr. J., and Andrew Toney.
</P>
<P>
   With his slender frame, quick feet and long arms, Cooper always
stood his defensive ground, backing down to no one. He was known
for coming out of nowhere and blocking shots at the basket.
</P>
<P>
   He was the Defensive Player of the Year in 1987, when he won the
fourth of five NBA titles with the Lakers, and was a five-time
all-defensive first team member.
</P>
<P>
   As the fourth head coach of the Sparks, Cooper is again putting
defense first.
</P>
<P>
   Just like he did, Cooper wants his players collectively to deny
and take away opponents strong points and get them out of their
comfort zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got all the credit for doing it, but defense is a team
effort and I wouldn't have been able to be the player that I was
defensively had it not been for my team,'' said Cooper, who was
surrounded by Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul Jabbar, James Worthy,
Byron Scott, and A.C. Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some good defensive standout people on this team. I
think Tamecka (Dixon) is very good when she gets into it, Mwadi
Mabika is very good, Ukari Figgs is good in her own right, and then
La'Keisha Frett. We're going to ask them to take on some tough
assignments.''
</P>
<P>
   As the assistant coach under Orlando Woolridge last year, about
25 percent of practice was reserved for defensive schemes and the
rest was offense, he said. This year, it's the opposite. With
shooters like Mabika and Dixon and Olympians Lisa Leslie and
DeLisha Milton on the court, Cooper felt safe to focus primarily on
defense.
</P>
<P>
   But to play defense you need to be in top physical condition, so
one of the first things Cooper established before the players even
arrived at training camp was to talk to each one about being in
shape once practice began. Everyone seemed to follow his
instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Trimmer, showing more muscle tone than ever, players like Dixon,
Allison Feaster, Mabika, and Clarisse Machanguana took Cooper's
words to heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is so important, because a coach may have all kind of
plans and philosophies and techniques that he wants us to do, but
if we're out of shape, shame,'' Machanguana said. ``He can only
work for so long. He's been running everything in practice hard,
hard, hard.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Cooper, there are three basic elements that are
essential to teaching a player good defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a player that understands how to play defense
and the mechanics of it,'' he said. ``Then after that I think it
would be desire. You have to want to desire to play defense. Your
coach can get on you all he wants and if you're going through the
motions, that doesn't do anything. Last, but not least, athleticism
and we have some athletes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With the players he has, Cooper is looking to play full-court
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kind of the way we played on the road in Charlotte and
Seattle. I think we have a good basis. As long as we come out and
stay focused. And that was the key (Friday) is that we didn't play
focused, defensively,'' Cooper said, referring to the 75-69 to
Seattle in their second meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is we don't take too many steps back. I think we did a
great job on the road. Those were steps that we weren't expecting
to take, but we made them.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time he understands the challenges the veterans are
experiencing, especially Leslie, Dixon, and Mwadi, who are now
playing for their fourth coach in as many years with the Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Cooper's experience with the Lakers was the primary
reason why Sparks president Johnny Buss hired him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly a lot of his experience I watched from the stands,
since I know what it was all about, the Pat Riley years, the Earvin
Johnson years,'' said Johnny Buss, the son of Laker owner Jerry
Buss.
</P>
<P>
   ``How he had to follow Earvin's lead and do it respectfully and
it with an enormous amount of confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Buss said he believes the Sparks' game of musical coaches
will end with the hiring of Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I'm comfortable with him,'' Buss said. ``It's actually
kind of scary. It's like I'm back with my family. I'm comfortable
that I could never kick my family out of the house. That's how I
feel.''

SPORTS COLUMN: KNICKS' BIG FELLA SHOULD KEEP HIS SEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Marcus Camby, you break the news to him. ``Not me,''
Camby said. ``I wouldn't want to be the one to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Then you do it, Chris Dudley. You took his place in the starting
lineup. It is your duty. ``Sorry, you got the wrong guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone, please, tell Patrick Ewing before he comes back and _
heaven forbid _ plays. Monopolizes the ball. Clogs the lane. Kills
the Knicks' hopes of making the finals. Ruins the season.
</P>
<P>
   After 13 postseasons, 131 playoff games _ more than 2,500 points
and 1,300 rebounds each May and June since 1988 _ this is hard to
say:
</P>
<P>
   Take a seat, Big Fella. You heard us. Bum foot or not, you're on
the bench for the rest of the Eastern Conference finals against the
Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   And you can stay there _ until the Knicks need a clutch hoop and
touch foul in the final 30 seconds of an elimination game. At which
point, we will again serenade you, apologize for ever cursing your
name and realize how infantile it was to think the Knicks could do
this without you, that somehow they are better off when you're not
on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime fan wanted to know at halftime if Jeff Van Gundy is
secretly making Ewing's injury sound worse than it is, the idea
being that the Knicks' coach understands that his team matches up
better with Indiana without Ewing. That, rather than saving the Big
Fella the embarrassment of playing him 20 paltry minutes, he now
has the luxury of an excuse.
</P>
<P>
   Even Rik Smits got on the Take Your Sweet Time, Pat bandwagon.
Asked if the Knicks are more potent against the Pacers without
Ewing, Smits replied: ``Sure seems that way, doesn't it? They
really stepped up their game, all the guys, individually.''
</P>
<P>
   The most bandied-about statistic after Game 4 was not the
Knicks' 41-32 rebounding edge. It was their 5-1 record against
Indiana in complete games in the playoffs without Ewing the past
two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what makes me laugh about that number now is how the
media can manipulate it,'' Van Gundy said. ``He played seven
minutes in the last game at Indiana, but we count that as with him.
Plus, he's never played a home game in that stretch. That makes it
look a little better, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy added: ``We play well when we share the ball and we
play inside-out. We have four guys we basically go into the post:
Pat, Larry, Latrell and Allan. We play off them. So when he is out,
we still have three post-up guys that we can go to.''
</P>
<P>
   All debate aside, the Knicks swung the ball around the perimeter
as if they were in concert on Monday, finding the open man for
either a 3-pointer or a layup like they had yet to do with such
precision all season.
</P>
<P>
   If Larry Johnson was not waiting on the right baseline to knock
down a pendulum-swinging shot, Kurt Thomas was tunneling through
the nooks and crannies of the Pacers' front line to score a tough
layup. They worked like a machine, five players acting as one.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Thomas looked Allan Houston off as he came around
a screen, like a quarterback faking a handoff to a running back. He
calmly stepped back and knocked down a 15-footer, with all the
confidence Larry Bird had in his playing days.
</P>
<P>
   Game 3 was more about adrenaline than great basketball. The
Knicks completed all the requisite tasks and received a huge
performance from Latrell Sprewell to snag a victory Saturday. Game
4 was about a team playing to its strength without Ewing, pushing
the ball upcourt as fast as its could, scoring 12 points on the
break, using its speed instead of its guile.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. The Knicks made 10 of 14 3-pointers and they won
by 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is one blessing about Patrick being out, it's that
we're fortunate we've been through it before,'' Dudley said. ``We
had to learn to play without him a year ago. But everybody knows we
need him. That's not even a question.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Sprewell: ``If someone said you're stronger against the
Pacers without Patrick, well, I don't think that means anything.
It's not fair to say we can win without him in there. He was so
effective in Game 1 when he was in there. We need him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing said he may play on Wednesday night in Game 5 in
Indianapolis. The Knicks will probably not be as unpredictable, the
seat-of-their-pants unit that has confounded the Pacers in New York
over the weekend. But they will still be better. It's not even
worth debating at 3 in the morning.  &QL;

DEVILS' ROBINSON IS NO SOFT TOUCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. - Although he was sitting, Larry Robinson
still towered over the packed room.
</P>
<P>
   There was the same proud head, the same soft voice talking
strategy as his New Jersey Devils prepared for tonight's opening
game of the Stanley Cup Finals against the defending champion
Dallas Stars.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how he tried to keep the focus away from himself,
Robinson's story is not one strictly about X's and O's.
</P>
<P>
   A year has passed since he was fired as coach of the Kings, and
though Robinson looks no different, so much has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot in the past year, how about the past week?'' he asked
with a smile, his team in the finals only after becoming the first
to overcome a 3-1 deficit to win a conference title.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible, however, to look ahead at this best-of-seven
series with the Stars without looking back at Robinson's 12-month
odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was fired by the Kings at the end of the 1998-99
season, partly because he got them to the playoffs just once in
four seasons. He was criticized for being too soft on his players.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he is considered the lightning rod for a team just four
victories from a championship, the same team that fell apart under
head coach Robbie Ftorek with only a month left in the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trust me, I am very proud of where I am this year as opposed
to where I was a year ago,'' Robinson said. ``I felt I didn't truly
finish what I started, didn't get the chance to finish what I
started. It's nice to be able to prove I'm not what everybody said
I was, that I was too soft and not able to be a coach because of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kings captain Rob Blake says that was never the problem. But
there was little question the team disintegrated in the middle of
last season after Robinson publicly questioned his desire to coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about all that,'' said Blake, who played beside
Robinson in his rookie year. ``I learned so much from him. But I
know we just didn't play for him. We had injuries, but the truth is
we just didn't play. I've always thought he would be a great coach
if he had a good team.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet those close to Robinson aren't sure whether he'll return
next year, Stanley Cup ring or not. The team recently was sold for
$175 million to a group that includes the New York Yankees and New
Jersey Nets and there is a good chance Robinson will walk away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'll back with the organization, but as head coach I
don't know,'' said Devils spokesman Rick Minch, who held a similar
position with the Kings during Robinson's first year in Los
Angeles. `` ``But I think he is more comfortable in this situation,
at this point. But that's just my opinion. The L.A. experience was
great because he learned a lot about coaching. And now he is in a
different situation here, applying everything he learned there.''
</P>
<P>
   After his firing from the Kings, Robinson became an assistant to
Ftorek, who also once coached the Kings. This was Robinson's second
tour with New Jersey - he helped Jacques Lamaire win the Stanley
Cup in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Devils began to crumble under Ftorek's tight reign
in the final month of the regular season, Robinson was asked to
step in. New Jersey, which was bumped in the first round the two
previous s The Devils also were desperate for the strong presence
that the former 6-foot-5 defenseman with six Stanley Cup titles
could provide.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson restored the team's passion and confidence, which
continued to soar during early round victories over Florida and
Toronto. When all that stalled early in the Eastern Conference
finals against Philadelphia, a different side of Robinson emerged.
</P>
<P>
   He unloaded on his players after Game 4, a tirade that was
widely criticized, but now is credited with turning the series
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever he told us was coming from his heart,'' Devils
goaltender Martin Brodeur said. ``It touched a lot of guys'
feelings. He's really nice to be around and it's easy to play
hockey for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't see him react like that and not listen. It was great
for him to be able to spit it out. Sometimes coaches have a hard
time getting their messages through, but he didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Robinson stresses that the finals ``should be about the
players and nothing else,'' there are plenty of subplots.
</P>
<P>
   - Robinson and Stars general manager Bob Gainey were the leaders
of Montreal Canadien teams that won four consecutive Stanley Cups
from 1976-1979. The teams in this series, which will be gritty and
hard-hitting, appear to be direct descendants of the Canadiens.
</P>
<P>
   - Although the Devils are playing for the sport's highest
achievement, captain Scott Stevens still is reeling emotionally
from a Game 7 hit he put on Philadelphia's Eric Lindros. The hit
led to the Lindros' sixth concussion and might end his career.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson is the thread that runs through it all. He has helped
Stevens restore his sagging play in the past month and will be a
focal point in getting Stevens' head back in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened to me when I was a player,'' said Robinson, who
ended the career of Edmonton's Craig Simpson with a hip check
behind the net. ``It is a difficult thing, but he has to put it
past him.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Robinson already has had a Hall of Fame career, the
next two weeks could establish a reputation he never got with the
Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the kind of person who looks at things that way,'' he
said. ``I don't really look at it that I was a scapegoat. They
wanted to make changes. That's this business.''

MUMTAZ CONTINUES SUCCESS AT LONE STAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARY RAMPELLINI 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas _ Mumtaz remained undefeated at Lone Star
Park at Grand Prairie yesterday when she rallied from last to
capture the $200,000 WinStar Distaff, one of seven stakes that made
up the second annual Lone Star Million Day.
</P>
<P>
   The unique program is the richest day of racing in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a fantastic race,'' said Tom Amoss, who
trains Mumtaz for a partnership that includes sports agent Randy
Hendricks. ``It looked a lot like last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year Mumtaz employed the same sweeping tactics to capture
the $150,000 Walmac Lone Star Oaks. For her come-from-behind
victory in the Oaks, she was voted Champion Turf Horse at Lone Star
Park in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The WinStar Distaff, however, might rate as an even stronger
performance for Mumtaz as she rallied against slow fractions to get
past starting highweight Evening Promise. The victory came
following a nine-month break from racing, during which she
underwent surgery to remove a bone chip from her left knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old Mumtaz is back,'' said Amoss, who late last week
decided to fly Mumtaz from Kentucky for the WinStar Distaff. ``Not
missing any work has a little bit to do with making this race. We
also felt the race came up at the right distance, and that it fell
at the right time. And, she'd already had success over the
course.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendricks was unable to see Mumtaz win the Oaks last year
because he was on vacation with his wife in Canada. He made it a
point to be in town for yesterday's race. ``I flew up this
afternoon,'' he said. ``When I watched her make her move around the
far turn, I figure we've got it unless some other horse just
outguns us.''
</P>
<P>
   Mumtaz trailed the field before starting to pass horses midway
on the final turn. She proceeded to run down Evening Promise
nearing the wire, and went on to a three-quarters of a length
victory in the mile race in a time of 1:37.28.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I asked her she really took off,'' said Victor Espinoza,
who was aboard Mumtaz for one of his two stakes victories
yesterday. ``When she comes from behind, she's very tough to
beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Mumtaz earned $120,000 for her victory, which improved her
career bankroll to $281,065. She has won five of 10 starts, and as
third choice in the wagering returned $10.

STARS' FIRST-TIMERS SAVOR CUP OPPORTUNITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAC ENGEL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J._ Stars winger Brenden Morrow has a chance
to do in fewer than 90 games what Colorado defenseman Ray Bourque
hasn't done in more than 1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Win a Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting a chance to do it my first year,'' Morrow said.
``Guys like Bourque have been waiting 21 years to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the Stars, the venerable NHL defenseman won't win his
first Stanley Cup this season.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the Stars, three other longtime NHL players with a
combined 40 seasons _ winger Scott Thornton and defensemen Sylvain
Cote and Dave Manson _ are in the position to win their first
Stanley Cup. And all of them are grateful, not only for being saved
from losing situations in midseason trades, but specifically this
chance at a Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we used that, as a group, for motivation in the last
series,'' Stars winger Brett Hull said. ``All anyone wanted to talk
about was Bourque. We sat down as a group and said we got Manson,
Thornton, Cote and some young kids that haven't been there before.
Why is \RBourque\S any more special than those guys? We want to
take our guys for them as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those guys have come close before, but none of them
really knew what it was like until the Stars defeated Colorado on
Saturday night in Game 7 of the Western Conference Finals. None of
them knew they would get this close. Ever. They were simply hoping.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you get close you wonder how many more chances you'll get
as your career moves on,'' said Manson, who was traded to the Stars
with Cote on Feb. 8 from the Chicago Blackhawks. ``I am definitely
fortunate. The furthest I've been in the playoffs is the
semifinals, and I've been there three times. It's frustrating. It's
mentally and physically draining and then not to reach your goal,
it's devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   So devastating that simply reaching the Stanley Cup Finals is a
relief? Apparently not.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people phoned me from back home about that
\Rrelief\S,'' said Thornton, who was acquired Jan. 22 in a trade
with Montreal. ``I had mixed emotions. I was elated and happy we
won for a chance to play for the cup. At the same time, I wasn't
celebrating too much. We have four more wins to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   This is what happens when you are traded to a team defending the
Stanley Cup. Manson, Cote and Thornton are expected to enjoy this,
but none are ready to proclaim this run an unequivocal success.
</P>
<P>
   Only winning four more games does that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find the players in the dressing room really control the
team in that there is a lot of peer pressure on each other to
compete higher,'' Thornton said. ``That's a fun way to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when you are a few games from realizing the fruition
of a lifelong goal, any way is a fun way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me 15 years to get to this point,'' Cote said.
``Certain people will never have a chance to be here. I am lucky
... four wins to go is the chance of a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how young or old.

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ If the Texas Longhorns make it to the
College World Series, there will be a new blond pitching for the
Arizona Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   When the Longhorns (43-19) arrived in Tempe, Ariz., for the

former Texas All-American Greg Swindell, now with the Diamondbacks,
who delivered a pep talk.

   ``I really didn't know what to say to you guys,'' Swindell
began. ``So my wife said, `Just tell them what you're always
telling me _ that you bleed orange and loved pitching at Texas more
than anything else.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That was the gist of the speech, which Swindell capped with a
promise: If the team makes it to Omaha, he will bleach his hair
blond.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, in a show of team unity, the Longhorns all became
bleached blonds _ then lost two of three games in the Big 12
Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But they came back Sunday to defeat top-seeded host Arizona
State twice, winning the regional and earning a host spot for the
Super Regional round this weekend. They will face Penn State
(45-17) in a best-of-three series beginning at 7 p.m. Friday at
Disch-Falk Field for the right to go to Omaha.
</P>
<P>
   They were guided by several bleached heroes in Tempe _ including
third starter Phil Seibel, who missed two months with an arm injury
but emerged to beat the Sun Devils in Sunday's first game, with
help from closer Charlie Thames, who picked up his 19th save.
</P>
<P>
   The clinching 9-7 victory in the nightcap was powered by a
three-run home run from catcher Ryan Hubele _ who grew up in nearby
Paradise Valley and had a grand homecoming, hitting .529 and
earning regional MVP honors.
</P>
<P>
   When ASU rallied in the ninth, Thames was gassed, having thrown
50 pitches in the afternoon game. So Texas brought in second
starter Beau Hale, who had lost a tough 3-1 decision on Saturday.
He struck out the last two Sun Devils to close it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really happy for this team,'' said Texas coach Augie
Garrido, ``because of how hard they've worked and what they had to
do to reach this point.''

LANGENBRUNNER STILL LISTED AS DAY-TO-DAY

<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Depending on interpretation, it remains
a mystery whether Stars winger Jamie Langenbrunner's sprained right
knee will allow him to play tonight in Game 1 of the Stanley Cup
Finals.
</P>
<P>
   He did not skate during the team's practice yesterday,
suggesting he likely won't play. He was clearly ordered to guard
against leaking information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defer all questions of that nature to coach Hitchcock,''
Langenbrunner said. ``I'm day-to-day.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock suggested Langenbrunner is improving faster than
expected, which suggests ...
</P>
<P>
   ``He's 50-50 right now,'' Hitchcock said. ``We were gearing more
toward Game 2. We are going to skate him \Rthis\S morning and see
how it feels. He is coming along fast. He is a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   Langenbrunner injured his knee in Game 5 against Colorado and
missed Games 6 and 7.  &QL; 
Chambers might retire
</P>
<P>
   When Stars defenseman Shawn Chambers last played on Oct. 8, he
didn't pay much attention to details.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he wishes he had. It might have been his last.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers, who missed all but four regular-season games with a
knee injury and had neck surgery a month ago, said there is a good
chance he might have to retire after this season. The knee hasn't
responded well to treatment. He said he would see a couple of
doctors in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll go check out doctors to see if they have something else
they can think of,'' Chambers said. ``I'm only 33 and I think I can
play. I'll give it one more shot this summer, and if I try to skate
and it doesn't come around that will be it.''  &QL; 
No wasted penalties
</P>
<P>
   The Devils enter the Stanley Cup Finals as the least- penalized
team in the playoffs, averaging 8.9 minutes a game. After watching
the Stars put together strong power-play attacks against Colorado,
New Jersey plans to remain disciplined.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot take any stupid or bad penalties,'' Devils center
Petr Sykora said. ``They were scoring really big goals on power
plays. I think it is going to come down to special teams. Special
teams can win it and lose it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils are 20-for-20 killing penalties at home and 48-for-51
overall in the playoffs.  &QL; 
Sticking to his guns
</P>
<P>
   At the season's inception, ESPN analyst and former Los Angeles
Kings head coach Barry Melrose picked the Stars to repeat as
Stanley Cup champions.
</P>
<P>
   He held on that pick through the playoffs, even when Dallas
faced a red-hot Colorado team in the conference finals. He's
staying with it now as well as the Stars prepare to meet the New
Jersey Devils.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been with them since Day 1,'' Melrose said. ``Everybody
else was jumping off the bandwagon and jumping on Colorado's, but I
never did. I like Dallas. Right now I think \R Ed\S Belfour is the
best goaltender in hockey. I think it's going to be harder than
people think, but I think Dallas will win in six.''  &QL;

STARS OVERCOME ADVERSITY TO BID FOR SECOND TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The Stars' season began with a Stanley
Cup banner-raising celebration at Reunion Arena. One night later,
first-line center Mike Modano lay unconscious on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Right then, the Stars should have known their season would be up
and down.
</P>
<P>
   Almost eight months later, however, the Stars are four victories
from being back on top of the NHL world. For all their injuries,
new faces and line changes, the Stars again are in the Stanley Cup
Finals, where they play the New Jersey Devils in Game 1 tonight at
7.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone through so much, starting the year with Modano's
injury,'' Stars winger Brenden Morrow said. ``We are the defending
Stanley Cup champs, so every team was out to get us and wanting to
have their best game against us. We've dealt with a lot of
adversity. We had to fight through a lot. We had to play without a
full lineup pretty much the whole year, and we played well. Now,
here we are _ four games away from winning it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Who would have expected that in a season when the Stars' Cup
runneth over with pitfalls? Well, the Stars for some.
</P>
<P>
   Even when they were losing players and games, the Stars never
lost faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone in the dressing room expected it, even though we had
faced a lot of injuries and had some down times during the course
of the year, especially in the beginning,'' Stars center Joe
Nieuwendyk said. ``You know, it's not what you do in October and
November. It's what you do now. Everybody in the locker room felt
that we were good enough and experienced enough to get back here.
Sure enough, here we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season was about thriving. This season was about surviving.
</P>
<P>
   A second Stanley Cup would complete a Stars' season that was
fractured, bent and broken. At times, the Stars were held together
with braces, tape and guts.
</P>
<P>
   Lacerated calves, fractured ankles, separated shoulders and
sprained knees were among the injuries that cost the Stars 395
man-games. It was in the second game that Modano strained neck
ligaments, broke his nose and suffered a concussion on a hit by
Anaheim's Ruslan Salei that forced Modano out of the lineup for
three games.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars were 9-11-3 and in last place in the Pacific Division
before a team meeting in Atlanta prior to their Nov. 26 game
against the Thrashers. From that point on, the Stars went 34-18-7,
winning the Pacific Division with 102 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we deserve a lot of credit,'' Stars center Guy
Carbonneau said. ``I don't think there too many teams in the league
right now that could have done what we did this year after winning
the Cup last year. The hangover, the pressure again and all the
injuries, to still get 100-something points is pretty amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest turning point in the season might have come in
Phoenix on Feb. 3. The Stars' 2-0 victory pulled them into a
Pacific Division tie with the Coyotes, who had gone into the
All-Star break with a franchise-record 29 victories and a solid
hold on first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went in there with not a big, strong lineup and we came out
with a 2-0 win, and I really felt like the team came together that
game,'' Stars winger Grant Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars did not re-sign veterans Pat Verbeek or Dave Reid
after last season. Instead, they signed free agent Kirk Muller in
December, acquired forward Scott Thornton from the Montreal
Canadiens in January and traded with the Chicago Blackhawks for
defensemen Sylvain Cote and Dave Manson in February. The four
newcomers immediately fit in with the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Stars soon could be fitted for a new ring.
</P>
<P>
   After beating the Colorado Avalanche in Game 7 of the Western
Conference Finals on Saturday, the Stars find themselves favorites
once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a tough year after you win the Cup,'' Nieuwendyk
said. ``It's hard to get your level up to where it has to be in
October and November, and we didn't get out of the gate very well.
Then, we faced a lot of injuries to key people. It seemed like one
thing after another was happening to our hockey club. But we
managed to go through and win our division again and be in a
position to win another Stanley Cup. I think that's a tribute to
the character and the experience of our hockey club.''

GONZALEZ SAYS TRADE HURTS, BUT NO HARD FEELINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The trade still hurts, even more than the injured left
foot that could keep him out of the lineup for the next three days.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gonzalez made that perfectly clear sitting in the Detroit
Tigers' clubhouse yesterday, a few hours before he was hoping to
play against the Rangers for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it was hard,'' Gonzalez said, ``Thirteen years with one
club, it did hurt me. They never talked to me ... then I'm traded.
It's business. I understand that. But I was hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, Gonzalez insists he harbors no hard feelings toward
his former team after being traded by the Rangers in a nine-player
deal in November.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a few vague derogatory references toward the public
relations department, he said the Rangers in general treated him
and their other Latin American players well during his time in
Texas. He spoke highly of general manager Doug Melvin, manager
Johnny Oates, his ex-teammates and the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rangers organization, I have great memories there,''
Gonzalez said. ``The Rangers treated me good; they treated Latin
players good. I have a lot of good friends there, there are good
fans there, it was a good place to play baseball. I don't talk
negative about the Rangers. I appreciate the opportunity. They
signed me to play professional baseball and gave me a chance to
play in the big leagues with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps time heals all wounds, but those comments conflict with
ones made in spring training about the Rangers' poor treatment of
Latin American players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doug treated me good. Johnny treated me good,'' Gonzalez said.
``Most everybody in the organization were great. There were some
problems with \Rthe public relations department\S, but that's
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin said: ``We knew he was hurt by the trade. When I talked
to him on the phone, I told him, `Juan, I've got bad news. You've
been traded.' He was shocked, but players go through that. He
probably thought he was going to play his whole career with the
Rangers.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez was looking forward to playing against the Rangers
yesterday, and ESPN even chose the game for national broadcast
because of the anticipated reunion. But that was dashed when
Gonzalez was scratched before the game with a strained left heel.
There is a good chance he will not play during the three-game
series against the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   It's the latest in a series of setbacks for Gonzalez and the
Tigers. He has missed seven games because of various injuries, he
has driven in just 19 runs, and the Tigers, going into last night's
game, were 17-29, the second worst record in the American League.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez also remains eligible for free agency after the season,
and the Tigers are in danger of having precious little to show long
term for the trade that sent pitchers Justin Thompson, Francisco
Cordero and Alan Webb, catcher Bill Haselman, infielder Frank
Catalanotto and outfielder Gabe Kapler to the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers offered Gonzalez a $140 million, eight-year deal in
spring training, and it was thought that deal would be completed.
But Gonzalez said he's not ready to commit long term to Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big question for me, a big decision,'' Gonzalez said.
``It's a good organization, and it's treated me so great. They have
good fans, a great tradition. But it's a big decision. I want to
wait ... maybe after the All-Star break, maybe at the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking at the future of the team. That's very important.
I'd like to win. This year has started off slow. Everybody's
struggling. But now we're playing a little better against some
better teams. So we'll see what happens.''

DODGERS DEFEAT METS, 4-1 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It took only a three-pitch span to shatter Al
Leiter's run of perfection.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Mets had won all nine of Leiter's starts before
Monday, and they were tied in the sixth inning against the Los
Angeles Dodgers. No Dodger had batted with a runner in scoring
position until F.P. Santangelo came up with a man on second and one
out in the sixth. That is when Leiter's trouble began.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter, who thrives by pitching inside, drilled Santangelo in
the backside. The Dodger Stadium crowd stirred. One pitch later,
Leiter plunked Mark Grudzielanek just above the elbow. The crowd
hollered. On Leiter's next pitch, Shawn Green rocketed a grand slam
over the wall in right-center. The crowd erupted.
</P>
<P>
   The slam provided more than enough support for the right-hander
Chan Ho-park, who held the Mets to two hits over seven shutout
innings in a 4-1 Dodger victory.
</P>
<P>
   Five innings before Leiter was hurt by Green's bat, Mets
shortstop Rey Ordonez was hurt by Santangelo's helmet on a tag play
at second base. Ordonez left in the bottom of the first; a
nondisplaced fracture of the ulnar bone in his left arm was
diagnosed. He could miss up to two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But the big blow of the game came from Green, the outfielder who
became baseball's highest-paid position player when he signed a
six-year, $84 million contract after being traded from Toronto last
winter. The homer was his 10th and the grand slam was his second of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets did not get a runner past second base off Park, who
improved to 5-4 with the victory. Park helped a few potential
rallies by issuing six walks, but the Mets were 0 for 4 with
runners in scoring position until the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Fetters pitched a scoreless eighth and Jeff Shaw allowed a
run-scoring double to Joe McEwing with two out in the ninth. But
Edgardo Alfonzo grounded out as the potential tying run, ending the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Only one other pitcher in the National League _ the Dodgers'
Orel Hershiser, who is now pitching in the minors _ has hit more
batsmen this season than Leiter, who has eight. It is a necessary
byproduct of pitching inside, and Leiter has otherwise had good
control this year, averaging fewer than three walks per nine
innings.
</P>
<P>
   One area in which Leiter has excelled has been holding runners
on. Leiter, whose record slipped to 5-1, has six pickoffs, the most
in the National League, and it was on one of them on Monday that
Ordonez got hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Santangelo led off the Dodger first with a walk _ after an error
by Robin Ventura on a foul pop _ and before Leiter's first pitch to
the next hitter, he threw to first. Santangelo was going, and Todd
Zeile threw to Ordonez covering second for what should have been a
routine tag.
</P>
<P>
   But Zeile's throw sailed, and Ordonez leaped for it with his
glove hand outstretched. The three-time Gold Glove shortstop caught
it, whirled and, in one motion, swiped a backhanded tag on
Santangelo.
</P>
<P>
   But Santangelo's helmet plowed into Ordonez's left arm, and
Ordonez fell to the ground in pain. He was examined by team
trainers and left the game.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Abbott replaced Ordonez at short and more help could be on
the way as soon as Tuesday. The utility player Melvin Mora is
eligible to come off the disabled list, and he has been on a
rehabilitation assignment at Class AAA Norfolk, where he has hit
.333. The right-handed-throwing Mora played his last two games
without a protective bandage on his right index finger, which
needed four stitches after he injured it bunting on May 12.
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Steve Phillips said before the game that Mora
would probably rejoin the team when it returned home Friday; it is
now reasonable to think that Mora could be brought back sooner.
</P>
<P>
   The reliever Jim Mann, who made his major league debut on
Monday, is the most likely candidate to be sent down when Mora
returns. Mann relieved Rich Rodriguez _ who threw one and one-third
scoreless innings despite two walks _ with one out in the eighth,
allowing singles to Gary Sheffield and Eric Karros before ending
the inning with a pop-up and fly out.

GREER FEELS DIFFERENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Rusty Greer wasn't thrilled about spending six weeks
on the disabled list because of ankle surgery, a strained hamstring
and a sore shoulder. But he is convinced his return that he made
the right decision in having ankle surgery to have bone chips
removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is night and day compared to what I was running
with before the surgery,'' Greer said. ``Especially starting off
taking the first two or three steps. But I feel like it will be
this winter and spring training before it feels like nothing was
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer admitted the ankle not only affected his speed on the
bases but also his defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was from the standpoint in the outfield you have to
get a good jump, and the first two or three steps it what was
affected the most,'' Greer said. ``Balls fell in that _ I'm not
saying now they'll be caught _ but I'll come a lot closer to
catching.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm especially glad I got it done just because having to
go out there every day knowing something is going to hurt you and
it's not going away. It's not fun. You have little nagging injuries
during the season, but most of them are going to go away. The ankle
has been there for two or three years.''  &QL; 
Comerica observations
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnny Oates had three observations about Comerica Park,
the Detroit Tigers new ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   It's big, especially with a 395-foot power alley to left-center
field. Said Oates: ``I told the guys, `If you're going to get hurt,
you better do it near the infield. Otherwise I'm not running out
there.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The grass is thick. Oates said, ``We hit for 25 minutes in early
batting practice and not one ball hit in the gap rolled to the
warning track.''
</P>
<P>
   It's nicer than Tiger Stadium. Said Oates: ``I like tradition
and all that, but it's nice to go into a clubhouse where I can go
into my office and make a phone call, hang up my clothes or eat a
sandwich that you know a rat didn't run across the night before.
We're all spoiled. We like our amenities.''  &QL; 
Catalanotto not ready
</P>
<P>
   Infielder Frank Catalanotto was hoping to be healthy enough to
play the field during the Rangers' three-game with his old team,
the Tigers. But that won't be the case. Catalanotto is still
feeling the strained groin muscle that has been bothering him since
April 12 and remains limited to designated-hitter duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping by Friday he'll be able to play,'' Oates said.  &QL; 
Payroll reduction
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have a payroll of $70 million. General manager Doug
Melvin said if the Rangers had re-signed every player from last
year, they would have had a payroll of approximately $95 million.
That was one of the foremost reasons why he traded Juan Gonzalez to
the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still going to be a year or two before you can evaluate
that trade,'' Melvin said. ``But I stand by what I said before:
It's a trade that will help both clubs if they sign Juan. He's
still going to put up numbers. Obviously if they don't sign him, it
will be a disaster for them. It will be a disaster for us if Justin
Thompson doesn't pitch for us. But we're still proud of the guys we
got.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Magic and Bird made it look too easy. A year or two in the NBA
and size 'em up for championship rings.
</P>
<P>
   But winning an NBA championship is never easy, as most future
Hall of Famers understand.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Michael Jordan, who needed seven years, Scottie Pippen and
Phil Jackson to reach the pinnacle with the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Or Isiah Thomas, who won his first title in his eighth season
with Chuck Daly and the rest of the Detroit Pistons' Bad Boys.
</P>
<P>
   Or Hakeem Olajuwon, who, thanks to MJ's first retirement, helped
transform Houston from Choke City into Clutch City in his 10th
season.
</P>
<P>
   Or David Robinson, who finally became a champion with Tim Duncan
and the San Antonio Spurs last year, The Admiral's 10th in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal thought it would be easier. He even boasted of
winning everywhere _ except in college and the pros. In 1995, his
third season with the Orlando Magic, he reached the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Shaq hasn't been back.
</P>
<P>
   But this season, his eighth, O'Neal has the coach, the teammates
and the will to win it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just on a mission,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mission never seemed more possible for the 7-foot-1,
340-pound MVP, who towered over the league this season. Now, O'Neal
and the Los Angeles Lakers are one victory from reaching the NBA
Finals and their final quest.
</P>
<P>
   But it hasn't been easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to go through a few failures before you realize that
it's worth several sacrifices in order to get to the top,'' said
Mavericks assistant coach Del Harris, O'Neal's first head coach
with the Lakers. ``It doesn't come that easily. \RShaq's\S gone
through some disappointments, and now he's paying a bigger price.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's now 28 years old, and, interestingly enough, Michael
Jordan was 28 before he ever won a championship.''  &LR; subheds:Taking
sage's advice Phil Jackson imparted the sacrifices made by Jordan
and the Bulls to ``get over the hump'' before the season, when Shaq
spent time with the Lakers' new coach on Jackson's Montana ranch.
Jackson told O'Neal that an MVP season, like Jordan's, would be
necessary for the Lakers to add a 12th Larry O'Brien Trophy to
their collection of NBA championships.
</P>
<P>
   Though Jordan's gravity-defying skills dazzled the league early
in his career, the Bulls did not win. Chicago made the playoffs his
first three seasons but went 1-9 in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's career has followed a similar journey, linking the
league's most dominant inside force with the biggest playoff duds.
In six trips to the playoffs before this year, O'Neal's teams have
been swept out five times, though after the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson set out to change that, much as he did with Jordan.
Learning to trust his teammates and the triangle offense helped
Jordan's Bulls overcome the Pistons and, ultimately, win six NBA
championships. Those same principles have O'Neal and the Lakers on
the brink of the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's trying to get through to them the same philosophy we have
in practice,'' Jackson said. ``You go out and do everything with
the intensity necessary for whatever the challenge is. And that you
rise to meet that challenge ... Whether you're front-runners in the
playoffs, or front-runners in the regular season, it's how you get
through when you carry doubts in your head. You just can't have
that. You've got to go play.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time last summer, Shaq focused more on his play
than playing with his Hollywood toys. He did not make a movie or
cut a rap album. He worked on his game. Hard.
</P>
<P>
   And the hard work paid off, with the Lakers storming to 67
victories and at one point threatening to join Jackson's 1995-96
Bulls as the only NBA teams to win 70 games. O'Neal became the
Lakers' first player to win MVP honors since Magic Johnson in
1989-90. O'Neal received 99.2 percent of the first-place votes,
shattering Jordan's 96.5 percent in '96.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a man you just can't believe watching night after
night,'' Lakers legendary radio play-by-play voice Chick Hearn
said. ``He's transcended into a guy that eventually could be named,
if not the best center to ever play, one of the very best. And I'm
talking about Wilt and Bill Russell, Kareem and those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearn has called all six NBA championships won by the Lakers in
LA (the other five were won in Minneapolis). Hearn has watched the
Jackson-O'Neal dynamic from courtside with a perspective spanning
the league's past 40 years and O'Neal's first four in Los Angeles.
Hearn said O'Neal took Jackson's summertime words to heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to have to change your game, Shaq, \RJackson\S
told him,'' Hearn said. ``You're going to have to separate your
play and add it to the other players. And Shaq has made that kind
of adjustment.''  &LR; subheds:Change is good Shaq always will dunk, and
if other big men could punish the rim as often as he does, they
would gladly trade in their drop steps and fade-aways, too. And
though it may seem unfair, Shaq, healthy the past two seasons after
three years battling various injuries, has added an adequate spin
move and jump-hook to his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one of the few centers content to stay in the post and not
try to step out and take outside shots,'' O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   He's also setting screens and rebounding with more ferocity. His
13.6 rebounds per game this season were second in the league and
O'Neal's best since 13.9 as a rookie. Shaq led the NBA in scoring
for the second time in his career, nearly becoming the first since
Jordan to average 30. He scored at least 30 points 45 times, with a
career-high 61 against the LA Clippers on his 28th birthday. Shaq
also grabbed 20 or more rebounds in 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA's rule changes, designed to free up the offense and
increase scoring, helped Shaq move across the lane with less
resistance. Though O'Neal still gets more than his share of bumps
along the way, he is able to set up even closer to the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went from being most difficult to defend to impossible to
defend,'' Harris said. ``And changing the illegal-defense rule on
the strong side now allows him to play the pick-and-roll where he
doesn't have to rotate to anybody. Prior to this year, he had to
pick up someone. Now he can just lay down in there.''
</P>
<P>
   And wait to swat shots. O'Neal averaged 3.03 blocks per game,
his highest total since his rookie season and nearly twice last
season's average.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first seven years he played were good, but good because he
was so doggone bigger than everyone else,'' Hearn said. ``He's
still big, but now he's got a lot more perfection to his game. He's
got the desire to go to the hole when he gets the chance. He's
become a great passer. He never was a good passer.''
</P>
<P>
   With the emphasis on spacing in the triangle offense and the
Lakers' perimeter threats (Glen Rice, Robert Horry), O'Neal can
either kick the ball outside or dump it to a slasher (Kobe Bryant,
Ron Harper). Whether bounce, cross-court, swing or no-look, Shaq
passed for a career-high 3.8 assists per game this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's making a point of trying to get a lot of assists, to get
everyone involved. He's gonna get his, and his job is to try get
everyone else involved,'' Horry said. ``If we take shots and miss,
he's gonna go gobble up the rebound.''
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks forward Cedric Ceballos couldn't help but notice the
change in his former Lakers running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the first- and the second-best player in the game,''
Ceballos said. ``I don't know what he did this summer, but you
can't do nothing with him. There's nothing you can do. He's gotten
to the point where the fouls don't even matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only way they can stop him. I think that's what he
realized this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Foul shooting, barely over 50 percent for his career, remains
O'Neal's Achilles' heel. He once joked that if he were a good foul
shooter, there'd be no need to practice.
</P>
<P>
   But not even Hack-a-Shaq can stop O'Neal these days. He made all
nine of his free throws in Sunday's Game 4 of the Western
Conference Finals at Portland. A 103-91 victory gave the Lakers a
3-1 series lead.  &LR; subheds:Final ingredient Magic had Kareem. Bird
had McHale and Parish. Jordan had Pippen. O'Neal has Kobe Bryant,
the 21-year-old who considers himself an equal partner in
Showtime's revival.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal feuded with his original Bryant, former Orlando Magic
teammate Penny Hardaway. Billed as the Magic and Kareem of the
'90s, Little Penny and ``Little Warrior'' (the Islamic translation
of Shaquille Rashaun) made one trip to the NBA Finals, in 1994-95.
They were swept by Houston before flaming out. Shaq left Orlando
after four years, signing a $120 million deal with the Lakers, the
team he followed as a kid.
</P>
<P>
   He and Bryant arrived in LA in 1996, and they immediately
clashed. Both thought the other commanded the ball too much. Under
Phil Jackson, they have learned to play nice.
</P>
<P>
   Shaq averaged a career-high 29.7 points per game this season,
Kobe a career-high 22.5.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and Shaq complement each other so well out there now,''
Hearn said. ``Kobe and Shaq are a tandem. They look for each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a process. Winning a championship is a matter of
maturing,'' said Harris, who spent the two seasons and six games of
his coaching career trying to reconcile O'Neal-Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq has Kobe Bryant, now 21, alongside, whereas his first two
years Kobe was 18 and 19. It's a matter of a lot of things coming
together.''
</P>
<P>
   No one ever said it would be easy.

   (KANSAS CITY, Mo.: smaller rides.)
Added attractions
</P>
<P>
   But Cedar Fair hasn't shortchanged Kansas City's thrill seekers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 the company added the Detonator and the Ripcord, which
each drop riders straight down from heights of almost 200 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Young families received Cedar Fair's 1997 annual treat in the
form of Berenstain Bear Country, a kiddie park within a park based
on the popular children's books.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 the Mamba made its debut, rising 205 feet and dropping
riders at 75 mph. Attendance spiked to around 1.2 million. Last
year was Oceans of Fun's turn, with Hurricane Falls, a white-water
raft ride. Worlds of Fun added a quarter-mile go-kart track.
</P>
<P>
   This year's new ride is the Boomerang, a corkscrewing,
loop-the-looping, 12-story steel coaster billed as the only one of
its kind in the Midwest. It thrills riders not just once at 50 mph
but twice _ backward for the return trip.
</P>
<P>
   Keller knows exactly what's coming in 2001 and beyond, but he's
not tipping his hand.
</P>
<P>
   He will only say that next year's surprise is likely to be
another coaster with ``a different experience,'' while 2002
promises another family attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Half of Worlds of Fun customers are locals who live within an
hour's drive of the park that dominates the Northland's skyline
along Interstate 435. A huge percentage of them are the industry's
core consumer group, 12- to 24-year-old ``thrill riders'' whose
word-of-mouth advertising Keller values higher than the local
park's 50 billboards and torrents of radio and TV advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a badge of honor to be the first kid in the neighborhood
to ride the Boomerang,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Keller has plenty of room to expand and keep the new thrills
coming. The two parks share 115 undeveloped acres, and even the
larger rides consume no more than three acres or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Land is not a worry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two challenges
</P>
<P>
   Two issues facing nearly every amusement park are safety
concerns and accessibility for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri, a bill to tighten safety regulations was passed
this year and sent to Gov. Mel Carnahan. If he signs it, it will
take effect Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of any legal changes, Keller said, ``This industry by
its very nature wants to guarantee as much safety as possible.
We're very proud of our safety record.''
</P>
<P>
   At Worlds of Fun, Keller said, rides are inspected daily by park
employees and annually by consultants, insurance carriers and
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every fall we basically dismantle all of the rides for
extensive maintenance and rebuild,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, there's a continuing debate on increasing
amusement rides' accessibility to disabled people. Proposed federal
regulations raise serious design and cost issues for parks, and
Keller said they also threaten to slow the lines of patrons through
some attractions, cutting into revenue and inconveniencing all
riders.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the rides at Worlds of Fun are already accessible to
disabled people, Keller said, and the park offers a special
handbook to its disabled guests. That 29-page booklet pulls no
punches on the hazards posed by some rides and the imperative that
all riders be physically able to brace themselves and hold on
tight.
</P>
<P>
   Employees are not permitted to help wheelchair users and other
disabled riders, who must board, ride and exit by themselves or
with the aid of a companion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to do the best we can to offer rides to all people,''
Keller said. ``But there are limitations, just as there are in,
say, driving a car.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead
</P>
<P>
   Hunt's sale to Cedar Fair in 1995 was valued at $40 million. At
the time one industry expert estimated it would cost at least $130
million to reconstruct the two parks at then-prevailing prices.
</P>
<P>
   It's even more today, Keller said, with the price tag on a
state-of-the-art megacoaster as high as $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   To contain costs, the amusement park industry, like many others,
is going through an era of consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Cedar Fair is one of the consolidators.
</P>
<P>
   Based on annual attendance, the trade publication Amusement
Business ranks the company as the world's fifth-largest theme park
operator, behind the four U.S. giants: Walt Disney Attractions,
Premier Parks/Six Flags, Universal Studios Inc. and Anheuser-Busch
Theme Parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've acquired a sizable park every couple of years,'' said
Brian C. Witherow, Cedar Fair's director of investor relations.
``We're out there aggressively looking.''
</P>
<P>
   But there just aren't that many big, independent, top-quality
parks like Worlds of Fun left to buy. ``It's not an endless
number,'' he said. ``Knott's and Worlds of Fun were two of the top
ones out there. There may be only a dozen left.''
</P>
<P>
   Cedar Fair's balance sheet has been strong throughout the '90s,
albeit oddly balanced.
</P>
<P>
   The seasonal nature of the business causes dramatically sharp
income spikes in the second and third quarters, with almost total
flattening in the fourth and first quarters.
</P>
<P>
   That's changed for the better since Cedar Fair's 1997
acquisition of year-round Knott's Berry Farm in California, which
generates cash flow 12 months a year.
</P>
<P>
   Annual earnings per share the past three years have averaged
$1.56. Cedar Fair stock closed Friday at 20 1/16, up 3/16. The
company's 52-week high of 25 7/8 was reached last June. The stock
hit 29 1/16 in 1998.

CEDAR FAIR'S WORLD'S OF FUN BEGINS 28TH SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Through a child's eyes, Worlds of Fun is a
magical place, an endless sea of eye-popping colors, heart-stopping
thrill rides and more candy, ice cream and adventure than a mere
day can handle.
</P>
<P>
   The view isn't much different for the adult who runs the place.
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Dan Keller is an amusement park guy _ has been
for the better part of 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   He started out hawking cotton candy and operating rides at the
Cedar Point amusement park near Cleveland. He was tapped for this
area's top amusement park job in 1995 when Cedar Fair LP bought
Worlds of Fun and Oceans of Fun from Hunt Midwest Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   In its 28th season, Worlds of Fun is stable, profitable and
still popular with succeeding generations of youngsters and the
young at heart. Oceans of Fun, its sister attraction, is in its
19th year.
</P>
<P>
   Cedar Fair, the world's fifth-largest theme park operator, has
applied its standard business plan _ add a big ride or attraction
each year, and groom and inspire a staff that's friendly and
fastidious about details _ to keep the parks successful.
</P>
<P>
   The challenges are many, including public safety issues,
accessibility for the disabled and corporate growth through mergers
in an industry where few plum properties are available.
</P>
<P>
   The man at the top
</P>
<P>
   Keller manages his piece of Cedar Fair with a hands-on style.
</P>
<P>
   Every day he walks the hilly, wooded 235 acres of Worlds of Fun
and Oceans of Fun on a personal inspection tour, greeting many of
the park's nearly 2,000 seasonal employees by name, jotting notes
to himself and almost obsessively snatching up stray candy wrappers
and litter.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't much to pick up, which tells volumes about the
priorities Keller preaches to his overwhelmingly teen-age work
force, which he calls ``the backbone of our industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Keller takes pride in the fact that almost all of the year-round
staff of 100 are former summer workers, many of whom started as
teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   On a tour at Worlds of Fun one day last week, Keller paused at
the carnival midway's basketball hoop game, grabbed a ball and shot
_ the old-fashioned way, revealing his 50 years. Keller's
underhand-from-the-knees shot was all net.
</P>
<P>
   He smiles. ``I only take about five shots a week,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After getting his start in the business at the Cedar Point park,
Keller took a detour into the tire industry before earning a
master's in business administration and returning to the world of
roller coasters and summer fun.
</P>
<P>
   He held a succession of executive posts with the company that
became Cedar Fair LP, which is based in Sandusky, Ohio. The
partnership owns Cedar Point, Worlds and Oceans of Fun, Knott's
Berry Farm near Los Angeles, Dorney Park near Allentown, Pa., and
Valleyfair near Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, when Hunt Midwest sold its amusement parks to
concentrate on its principal businesses of mining and real estate,
Cedar Fair stepped up as an eager buyer, and Keller was headed for
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Lee A. Derrough, Hunt's current president and chief
executive and longtime Worlds of Fun general manager, predicted
Cedar Fair would ``be able to do some things that may be more
grandiose than anything we would have been able to afford.''
</P>
<P>
   He was right.
</P>
<P>
   Executing the plan
</P>
<P>
   Cedar Fair bought the parks for around $40 million and has since
invested around $30 million more in new rides and other
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   The park is a profit maker for the company, Keller said, and
local attendance has climbed modestly but within industry norms,
from around 1 million in 1995 to an expected 1.1 million at Worlds
of Fun and 300,000 at Oceans of Fun this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we look back on it, what we expected has come true,''
Derrough said.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt's stock holdings, in excess of 1.3 million shares, allow
Derrough to keep an eye on both parks as a member of Cedar Fair's
board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was truly a win-win for everybody involved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary requirement in this business is capital
reinvestment. They've done a fabulous job. I'm not sure we ever
would have even considered a ride of the scope of the Mamba.''
</P>
<P>
   The parks did grow and mature under Hunt's ownership, adding
such world-class rides as the Orient Express in 1980 and the
all-wood Timber Wolf roller coaster in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   But Cedar Fair's aggressive marketing philosophy adds a big
attraction almost every year to keep local customers coming back
for the newest thrill.
</P>
<P>
   Cedar Point, the company's flagship park, this year boasts the
world's tallest and fastest roller coaster. The 310-foot high
Millennium Force drops riders 300 feet down an 80-degree incline at
92 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   This summer Cedar Fair will debut what it says is the tallest
and steepest water slide in the world, at Knott's Berry Farm. The
Perilous Plunge will drop riders in boats 115 feet down a 75 degree
incline.
</P>
<P>
   Such rides probably aren't in the future for Worlds of Fun.
Kansas City is a smaller market than Los Angeles or Cedar Point's
Cleveland-Toledo-Detroit region, Derrough said, and the economic
realities of return on investment dictate Worlds of Fun will
probably always have smaller rides.

BLAZERS PAY PRICE FOR LEAVING HARPER OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He is supposed to be worn down. His surgically
repaired knees must ache. Whatever skills left after 14 seasons
figure to be more of a liability than an asset.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Lakers guard Ron Harper is no Rasheed Wallace or
Scottie Pippen or Shaquille O'Neal or Kobe Bryant. Harper is just a
role player, a fourth or fifth option, the 36-year-old Rodney
Dangerfield of the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Portland Trail Blazers have given him such little respect
that even Harper offers a hearty laugh, considering what has
transpired.
</P>
<P>
   Harper is a glowing example of why the Lakers hold a commanding
3-1 lead in the best-of-seven series. He's turned disregard into
constant daggers that have helped put the Lakers in position to
advance to the NBA finals with a Game 5 win Tuesday night in
Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   While O'Neal keeps making the Blazers pay for their Hack-a-Shaq
defense, Harper is leading an uprising by the Lakers' supporting
cast. The Blazers are daring the likes of Harper, Rick Fox, Derek
Fisher and A.C. Green to beat them.
</P>
<P>
   And guess what?
</P>
<P>
   ``They're paying for it, right?,'' Harper said Monday,
chuckling. ``They're getting beat, right? I wouldn't say this is my
highlight, but it feels good. I'm out there playing and doing what
they ask of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only do the Blazers look inferior, their supposedly superior
talent and depth has been rendered moot.
</P>
<P>
   Portland definitely did not plan on Harper scoring as much as he
has, but that's what happens whenever Pippen leaves Harper to
double-team O'Neal or Bryant. It was Harper who drilled a baseline
jumper to win Game 3. He then tattooed the Blazers with 18 points
Sunday in a Game 4 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Since the series began, Harper has harmonized the same chorus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I tell the guys is, 'My man is not guarding me,'''
Harper said. ``Scottie ain't guarded me all series long.''
</P>
<P>
   In the two biggest games of the season (both on the road),
Harper outscored Pippen, 30-23.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been getting open shots, and he has been able to take
advantage of them and get to the offensive boards,'' said Pippen,
who is about to lose out to Harper and Lakers coach Phil Jackson as
the former Chicago Bulls attempt to grab another championship ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows that he is able to freelance and roam and do some
things out there. We have to contain guys like Shaq and Kobe, and I
think Rasheed and I and the whole team has done a good job not to
let Kobe and Shaq dominate the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Blazers seem to have few answers for the Lakers when
Bryant and O'Neal find open teammates when the Blazers trap. Harper
not only has provided scoring relief, he's snared key rebounds,
made crisp passes and played decent defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harper has a lot of leadership and uses a lot of heady play,''
Bryant said. ``He knows his spots, and he's been a big key to our
success.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the same Ron Harper that Jackson remembers from the 1996
playoffs, in series against Miami and Seattle. This is why one of
Jackson's first moves after becoming Lakers coach was to call
Harper, who was considering retirement.
</P>
<P>
   While Jackson wears his rings to inspire from the bench, Harper
is the one whose savvy and championship experience nurtures on the
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say enough about Ronnie's game,'' said Jackson, who
had to pry Harper away from a couch and the golf course. ``He's a
smart player and such a steadying influence, and we're going to
need that to finish this team off.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper said if the Blazers keep leaving him open, he'll keep
making a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still know how to score. I have my tricks.'' said Harper,
who won three rings with the Bulls. ``It's not really any kind of
big secret. You go where there's nobody around.''
</P>
<P>
   Portland coach Mike Dunleavy steadfastly insists that he won't
change defensive schemes. The Blazers must work on closing down the
lane and preventing easy layups.
</P>
<P>
   All the Lakers want to do is fight off complacency and stoke the
killer instinct they developed in the first two rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the series is not over,'' O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   And Harper clearly isn't finished, either.

LAKERS LOOK FOR CLINCHER

<P>
   EL SEGUNDO -- Everything the Lakers are, they have shown in
taking command of the Western Conference finals. And everything
they are not -- or at least, didn't appear to be -- well, they've
shown all of that too.
</P>
<P>
   All of their strengths have come to the fore with a 3-1 series
lead over the Portland Trail Blazers. But the greatest strength
among them is suddenly the Lakers' ability to make every last
weakness disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Now they can make the Trail Blazers disappear too, with a
victory tonight at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant have played their superstar
roles, but the series has been defined by everything else:
</P>
<P>
   -A bench that was supposed to be inferior to Portland's has been
an asset (see ``28 points, Game 1'').
</P>
<P>
   -A team that couldn't win on the road for two rounds, going 1-3,
made a stand in Portland (see ``Victories, Games 3 and 4.'').
</P>
<P>
   -A 36-year-old guard no longer viewed as a scoring threat hit a
game-winning shot (see ``Harper, Ron -- Game 3'').
</P>
<P>
   -An MVP whose weak foul shooting could be exploited hit all nine
of his free throws, under pressure, on the road (see ``O'Neal,
Shaquille, cross-referenced under `Big Maravich' -- Game 4'').
</P>
<P>
   -And a team with a rich recent history of buckling at the first
sign of playoff adversity made a spectacular recovery from one
potentially devastating blow (see ``Oops, routed -- Game 2'').
</P>
<P>
   Meet the new Lakers, who can win their first NBA Finals berth
since 1991 with a victory tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been nice to be able to say we've met challenges, as
opposed to falling on our faces like we have in the past,'' said
Rick Fox. ``We've been able to say, `Hey, now we've had success,'
and put that behind us and look for a new ax to put away.''
</P>
<P>
   Mixed metaphors aside, the Lakers are exuding the confidence of
a championship team. Never has it been more evident than in this
series.
</P>
<P>
   The five-game set against the Sacramento Kings tested them. The
4-1 victory over the Phoenix Suns included just one slip. But the
Blazers posed all sorts of challenges with their depth and
athleticism and youth.
</P>
<P>
   All of it, overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very conscious of it,'' said Glen Rice, the latest Laker
to rise, with a 21-point effort Sunday. ``We learn from our
mistakes and we try and get better. And I think that's the most
important thing about this team is we always look to improve as we
move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Each series has given the Lakers a new demon to slay. This time
it was losing their first home game of the playoffs, a 29-point
loss in Game 2, and the home-court advantage. That, and the fact
they suddenly had to win on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think after that home loss we kind of had to refocus,''
O'Neal said. ``I think you guys (reporters) were judging us on the
previous road games we played, like in Sacramento and Phoenix. We
didn't play well at all, we really didn't have to play well, we
were playing dominant at home. And once we got our home-court
advantage taken away, it kind of gave us new focus. We've been able
to snap back focus all this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-game set in Portland ``was definitely a big test for
us,'' Rice said. ``We realize that everyone was pretty much saying
that it was going to be an impossible task for us to go up there
and win two games. We've done that, and now to finish it off, we
have to win on our court (tonight).''
</P>
<P>
   Which will pose another set of challenges, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Such as the fact the Lakers have gone 2-3 in elimination
games...
</P>
<P>
   ``It is something we seem to have stumbled around,'' Fox said.
``But we 've also earlier in this postseason here, learned from
some of our mistakes. We went on the road, and beat Portland in two
games whereas in the first series against Sacramento, we couldn't
get that. ... Now we hopet hat we can go out and finish a series
off at home, the way it's supposed to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Or the fact the Lakers often follow big wins with big-time
letdowns...
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely, coming off two wins, and just a great team on the
road, you're just oozing confidence,'' Derek Fisher said. ``And now
being back at home, where the last time we slipped up, I think
gives us a little more motivation to go out and really be sharp and
be a little more on top of our game.''
</P>
<P>
   And so no one's getting excited about an imminent Western
Conference title, and coach Phil Jackson is still preaching
big-picture perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't talk about complacency,'' he said, ``as much as we
talked about the journey of a thousand miles begins wih the first
step type of stuff. There's the job at hand that's important to do
and stay focused on that. And how important it is for this team to
understand that, because we've had our letdowns in the past, and we
understand that.''

MEDICARE CUT BACKS BLEEDING HOSPITALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY DELLA DE LAFUENTE  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - Some Arizona hospitals are hemorrhaging financially as
deep reductions in federal Medicare reimbursements threaten their
future.
</P>
<P>
   Especially at-risk are institutions that care for the poor as
hospitals compete with nursing homes, health maintenance
organizations and other health-care providers that want Congress to
increase payments to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten bloodied. Last year was the worst year by far,''
said Dan C. Coleman, chief executive officer of the Lincoln Health
Network, which operates hospitals at North Mountain and Deer
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman's hospitals lost nearly $15 million in unpaid services
for Medicare patients.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare pays for health-care services for people over 65 and
accounts for nearly 40 percent of the total revenues generated by
hospitals in the Phoenix area.
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, Arizona medical centers lost nearly $51 million as
a result of reduced payments from Medicare under the Balanced
Budget Act of 1997. Those losses are expected to swell to about $66
million this year, according to a survey by the Arizona Hospital
and Healthcare Association.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital executives are tightening existing operations and
shutting community health programs and other unprofitable patient
services as the costs of labor, drugs, blood and new technology are
rising faster than the amount covered by Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Net profit margins at the majority of the state's 70 community
hospitals sank collectively to a negative profit margin of less
than half of 1 percent, or -0.4 percent, down from an industrywide
profit margin among Phoenix area hospitals of 2.2 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers fall well below the national industry standard of
at least a 5 percent profit margin for hospitals to successfully
meet payroll, operating costs and make prudent investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see margins like this in hospitals, there's a great
danger in the Valley that a hospital could close,'' Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lincoln Network hospitals were two of 10 Phoenix area
hospitals that saw their positive net profit margins decline at the
end of the 1990s , according to data gathered for The Arizona
Republic by HCIA-Sachs, a Baltimore-based health information
company. &QL; 
ROCKY YEAR FOR LINCOLN
</P>
<P>
   Like other hospitals, Lincoln's anemic bottom line came after a
rocky year of grappling with Medicare's reduced payments. Profits
slipped at the network's two hospitals, where Medicare accounts for
nearly 30 percent of total revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln stopped the bleeding of red ink last year by shuttering
money-losing services including its popular program for managing
heart and lung diseases, a free health information service for
patients and a busy skilled nursing care unit, where the hospital
was paid $260 a day for care despite the actual cost of $650.
</P>
<P>
   Other Phoenix area hospitals are cruising in similarly chopping
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   `There will come a time when (now profitable) hospitals exhaust
their savings,'' said Jerry Smithson, chief financial officer at
St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital has been spending down its savings, posting a net
income of $17.8 million in 1999, with about $6.7 million coming
from investment income. St. Joe's also has pushed back upgrades in
non-clinical services.
</P>
<P>
   At Medicare-dependent Sun Health Corp., health care operations
posted a loss of $1.9 million in 1999, the company's second loss
since the early 1990s. Sun Health , owner of Boswell Memorial and
Del Web Memorial, expects to lose $46 million to Medicare over five
years, said Bill Sellner, the company's chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler Regional eliminated costly advertising and marketing
programs and closed an urgent care center in Sun Lakes because it
was draining a half-million dollars from the hospital, which kept
open a more profitable primary care clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Reductions in Medicare payments and the need to hire costly
temporary nursing staff to fill vacant slots cost hospital giant,
Banner Health of Arizona, about $20 million last year. Of that
amount, $14.2 million was lost to Medicare's reduced payment
system. The hospital system expects unreimbursed Medicare costs to
total about $22 million this year at its five hospitals, including
Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center and Desert Samaritan, system
spokesman Dan Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix Memorial Hospital divested its medical group practices
and home health businesses because they were costly to run and
facing new competition, said Reginald Ballantyne III, president and
chief executive officer of Phoenix Memorial Health System.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Maricopa Medical Center did not return telephone
calls seeking comment. &QL; 
`I DON'T WANT TO CRY WOLF'
</P>
<P>
   Some hospital executives admit that, in the past, the industry
has overstated the effects of previous Medicare cuts. They are
adamant that the current crisis is real, and threatens the future
of longtime medical institutions.
</P>
<P>
   `I don't want to cry wolf, but the problems are severe. There's
a limit to the amount of money a hospital could lose,'' said John
Rivers, president and chief executive officer of the Arizona
Hospital and Healthcare Association, which is part of a national
lobbying campaign to persuade Congress to restore money cut from
their Medicare payments in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A report issued earlier this month by the accounting firm of
Ernst &AMP; Young and HCIA-Sachs said the Balanced Budget Act created
the greatest instability that hospitals have experienced since the
creation of Medicare in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that nationwide total hospital profit margins
have significantly fallen since the law went into effect. Total
margins fell to 2.9 percent in 1999 from 5.5 percent before the
1997 law. The margins were the lowest since 1984, the study said.
The Federation of American Health Systems, which represents large
hospital chains, paid $50,000 of the report's $200,000 cost.
</P>
<P>
   `The federal government has recognized that they have cut out
all of the fat and now are cutting into the muscle. The hospitals
that have a significant commitment to caring for the poor are truly
threatened,'' St. Joseph's Smithson said. &QL;

LAMB'S NIFTY PLAY BAILS OUT RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Rangers third baseman Mike Lamb has always been able
to hit, but there are supposedly still some questions about his
defense.
</P>
<P>
   He gave at least one answer to those questions last night. He is
perfectly capable of making a game-saving play when a bases-loaded
disaster is looming for the Rangers in the bottom of the ninth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb, with the bases loaded and one out in the ninth, made a
terrific backhand stop of Deivi Cruz's wicked one-hopper and turned
it into a game-ending double play, allowing the Rangers to hold on
for a 3-2 victory against the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park last
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a pretty good play,'' said closer John Wetteland, who
set a Rangers record for saves in a month with his 11th in May.
``And he can hit, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamb was 2-for-4 at the plate, but without his superb defensive
play the Rangers likely would have wasted a gritty eight-inning
performance from Kenny Rogers and fallen to their fourth
consecutive defeat. Rogers held the Tigers to two runs on nine hits
through eight innings with an assortment of pitches thrown at
different speeds and different arm angles.
</P>
<P>
   The generic baseball term is junk, but it was highly effective
against a Detroit lineup without Juan Gonzalez, who did not play
because of a strained tendon in his left heel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on I thought he was too strong and was a little bit up
in the strike zone,'' manager Johnny Oates said of Rogers. ``Later
in the game he went back to his off-speed stuff, got his sinker
going and got a lot of ground-ball outs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers turned four double plays, including the one started
by Lamb in the ninth. Luis Alicea and Rafael Palmeiro provided the
offense with home runs off Tigers starter Jeff Weaver in a ballpark
that's supposedly a tough place to hit one out.
</P>
<P>
   But they hit it to dead right field, which, as Palmeiro pointed
out, is about the only place in Comerica that favors a home-run
hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything else is Death Valley,'' Palmeiro said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, Death Valley, the Grand Canyon, Yellowstone Park,''
Alicea said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Palmeiro, ``Nah, Luis can hit them out of any park.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Alicea said. ``At about five a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday was his second. For Palmeiro, it was his 14th.
Together they gave the Rangers a 3-2 lead that held up despite
serious threats in the eighth and ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Halter led off the eighth with a double into the
right-field corner off Rogers, declining what appeared to be a
better-than-average chance of stretching it into a triple. But the
rally ended when Jose Macias bunted back to the mound, allowing
Rogers to nail Halter at third.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland took over in the ninth and got into trouble when Dean
Palmer singled off Palmeiro's glove at first and Bobby Higginson
lined a single to right. Luis Polonia then bunted the runners to
second and third, and Robert Fick was walked intentionally to load
the bases.
</P>
<P>
   That brought up Cruz, and Wetteland, known to strike out a
batter or two, was thinking double-play ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Runner on third less than two outs, you can't let him get the
ball in the air,'' Wetteland said. ``I was trying to get a cheap
ground-out double play.''
</P>
<P>
   He got one, but it wasn't cheap. Cruz smashed one that Lamb
short-hopped with the backhand. He stepped on third for the force,
then threw home to get Palmer as catcher Ivan Rodriguez held on
during the inevitable collision at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a reaction,'' said Lamb, who was signaled before
the play by infield coach Bucky Dent to look for the
second-to-first double play. ``But I knew Deivi can run, so I felt
if it was an in-betweener I would go home to get the force. But it
all really happened so quickly, I didn't really think about it. I
just did it.''

`PUMPKIN' FIRE DEFIES EFFORTS TO CONTAIN IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<P>
   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - A fire burning deep into one of northern Arizona's most
pristine forests continued to defy firefighters Monday, May 29,
racing up Kendrick Mountain and threatening a historic cabin and a
lookout tower. Smoke from the fire was threatening to close Arizona
180, a popular road to the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   But a blaze that caused evacuation of a Sedona-area campground
and the closure of U.S. 89A was more than half contained.
</P>
<P>
   Fires across Arizona pushed the number of acres burned this year
to more than 34,000 _ almost eclipsing the total for all of last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, there were about 50,000 acres burned by wildfires.
And while the pace is not quite that of 1995, when nearly 245,000
acres were burned, the season has started early this year with lots
of old, dry timber to burn.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Pumpkin'' fire in the Kaibab National Forest grew to 7,000
acres Monday morning. Then it ran up Kendrick Mountain when winds
on the Mogollon Rim picked up and relative humidities dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Winds were blowing toward the northeast, and about 750 people
were fighting the fire Monday, May 29, assisted by air tankers,
helicopters and bulldozers. Four firefighters suffered minor
injuries, a fire official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fire started making some runs along the northeast side of
mountain,'' spokeswoman Emily Garber said. ``It hasn't gotten to
the top, but a lot of the north face has been burned.''
</P>
<P>
   CABIN WRAPPED UP
</P>
<P>
   At the top is a historic cabin and a lookout still used by
hikers. The 1912 cabin was wrapped in silver flame-retardant
material in hopes it could be saved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retardant bombers really drenched the peak,'' Garber said of
the planes that drop a pink mixture of water, fertilizer and
fire-suppressant.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made numerous drops to try and slow down the fire. So now
instead of a silver-wrapped house, we've got a pink-and-silver
house.'' The ``Vultee'' blaze, named for an arch in Oak Creek
Canyon, forced the evacuation of Slide Rock on Sunday, May 28,
afternoon. By Monday afternoon, officials were predicting full
containment for this morning.
</P>
<P>
   As those two fires blazed on, authorities were continued to
perform a balancing act with their available resources.
</P>
<P>
   35 CREWS ON JOB
</P>
<P>
   Of 35 elite Type I ``hotshot'' crews working in the Southwest on
Monday, May 29, 22 were assigned to Arizona: two teams from
California mopping up the ``Outlet'' fire on the Grand Canyon's
North Rim; six teams, including one crew from the Wenatchee
National Forest in Washington, fighting the Pumpkin fire; and 14
teams _ including two Montana and three California crews _ on the
Vultee fire.
</P>
<P>
   But officials are worried. So even when crews are released from
the Vultee and Pumpkin blazes _ ``demobed'' in firefighter-speak _
they'll remain at Fort Tuthill County Park south of Flagstaff,
``just in case they're needed to fight fires in the area in the
next few days,'' Coconino National Forest spokeswoman Raquel
Poturalski said.
</P>
<P>
   Command teams for the fires are also being taxed.
</P>
<P>
   `FULLY ENGAGED'
</P>
<P>
   A Kaibab National Forest spokeswoman _ noting that the forest
had six fires on it one day last week _ commented that the Kaibab's
substantial firefighting resources were ``fully engaged.''
</P>
<P>
   She's now on her way to New Mexico for the ``Viveash'' fire
north of Pecos, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   The state has been supporting the fires on forest land with its
own equipment, but that, too, is a dangerous proposition. The state
has been lucky so far, with none if its lands burning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of walking a tightrope right now,'' said Ron
Melcher, a fire coordinator with the state. ``We always walk it at
this time of year. How many resources can we put in there and still
have enough to fight another fire?'' &QL;
