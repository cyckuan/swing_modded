PIVOTAL CALL SINKS LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ It figured to come down like this. Dennis Rodman
reappears, hustles his rear off, displays the demeanor of a choir
boy, and he (begin ital)still(end ital) manages to figure in the
most controversial play of the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But even the most ardent Worm-a-phobes can't pin that pivotal
play, or Sunday's 113-109 Laker loss to Seattle, on Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the fourth quarter, Rodman and Shaquille O'Neal
knocked themselves to the floor wrestling for the same rebound,
with Seattle's Olden Polynice and the Lakers' Tyronn Lue charging
to the pile.
</P>
<P>
   Officials called a jump ball. But not for Rodman, nor O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   It was 7-foot Polynice vs. 6-foot-in-high-heels Lue.
</P>
<P>
   And it was almost comical. Just not to the Lakers, who watched
Seattle win the tip, get a 3-pointer from Hersey Hawkins and a
fourth point when Hawkins drained the technical foul called against
coach Kurt Rambis.
</P>
<P>
   Within seconds, a tie game became a four-point deficit. Within
minutes it grew to eight points, and several comeback tries later,
it was just another costly, frustrating loss on the home court.
</P>
<P>
   One controversial call, one badly played third quarter, several
breakdowns in final minutes. Nothing new for the Lakers, who can
broad jump 10-foot hurdles only to trip over grains of sand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very disappointing,'' O'Neal said. ``I've been saying the
same thing the last two years: We have to play smart, play
consistent. Whenever we lose games like this, it's not because the
other team beat us, it's just because we beat ourselves. Until we
learn how to overcome those silly mistakes in the third and fourth
quarter, we're not going to go anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   They did maintain footing, however, holding onto fourth place in
the Western Conference thanks to Houston's loss to Utah. But the
Lakers' disjointed play down the stretch doesn't bode well for road
games this week at Portland and Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Despite everything, they somehow cut Seattle's lead to three
points with 31.3 seconds left. But Robert Horry threw away a pair
of inbounds passes for turnovers, the Sonics hit most of their free
throws, and the Lakers' last-gasp efforts came up short as
Seattle's lead bulged to nine points.
</P>
<P>
   A three-point play from O'Neal and 3-point jumpers by Horry and
Derek Fisher eventually cut the deficit to two points, but with 5.2
seconds left, it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hard-fought game,'' Rambis said. ``They played well,
I thought we did a lot of good things. But they just played a
little bit better than us today.''
</P>
<P>
   The jump-ball call just made it harder to stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw what happened, they made a (bleeped)-up call, like
they always do,'' O'Neal said. ``It was me and Dennis fighting for
the ball, and Ty Lue came from the back after the fact. They was
trying to be cute on the (bleeping) call. You know what happened.
But they (officials) don't get fined by the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Rambis pleaded guilty to an ill-timed technical but added, ``It
was clearly the wrong call. Shaq should have had (the jump
ball).... Ty came in there unbelievably late.''
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant admitted it was ``a tough blow,'' but added, ``You
just have to fight through it.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help that the Lakers couldn't slow Gary Payton (33
points) and Vin Baker (20 points). They scored 11 points each in
the third quarter, as the Sonics turned a six-point deficit into an
11-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers wasted a 50 percent shooting effort and a 25-point,
nine-assist, zero-turnover performance from Bryant. They've also
wasted a string of home games, having gone 2-3 this month, with
only four Forum dates left in the final 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's looking backwards; I don't do that,'' Rambis said.
``We've just gotta do things to make us better. We did a lot of
good things today. I'm happy with the good things and disappointed
in some other things. We'll watch the videotape and try to learn
from our mistakes.'' &UR; !dlim!!end! &QL;

BUDDHIST MONK LEADS WALK TO PROMOTE PRISON REFORM
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By HUBERT B. HERRING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOBBS FERRY, N.Y. _ The streets of this Westchester County town,
where shiny sport utility vehicles grudgingly share space with
joggers, featured an unusual sight on Sunday: eight people walking
single file, one holding aloft a long purple ``prayer banner,''
another holding a banner heralding a ``Prison Reform Walk.''
</P>
<P>
   As they walked they drummed and chanted, creating a hypnotic
rhythm that echoed blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   The group had walked for nearly a month, 15 to 18 miles a day,
starting northeast of Albany and zigzagging down the state. Along
the way they visited a number of prisons, trying to spread
awareness of what they see as the injustices of the prison system,
including overlong sentences, insufficient educational
opportunities, and use of the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Some walk for only a few days, some have come the whole way. The
driving force is a Buddhist monk named Jun Yasuda. Sister Jun came
to this country from her native Tokyo 20 years ago and has been
taking part in walks ever since, for causes from peace to Native
American rights.
</P>
<P>
   Why walk? ``It's simple,'' Sister Jun said. ``Humans for many
thousands of years were just walking.'' She walks nearly half of
each year, she said, and has numerous contacts to tap when shelter
or a meal is needed.
</P>
<P>
   These walkers spent the night before sleeping on the floor of
South Presbyterian Church here _ as self-proclaimed ``beggars,''
they take food and shelter where it is offered _ and attended the
church service at 10 a.m. But before that Sister Jun had the group
up and walking, banners aloft, in full chant.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're packed, Jun-san starts walking,'' said Denise
Laffan of Atlanta, the group's other monk, employing the Japanese
honorific all the walkers use for the leader. ``She's not one to
sit around.'' After the service, they hit the road again quickly.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday, after stops including Rikers Island, they plan to
end the walk with a daylong fast at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Jun, 50, lives at the Grafton Peace Pagoda, northeast of
Albany _ a volunteer-built temple on 10 donated acres where the
walk began. She lives there ``free of the material world,'' she
says, unconcerned with mundane matters such as health insurance.
And if she should get sick? She shrugs off the possibility. ``If
you worry about yourself, you cannot do anything,'' she said.
``It's the world that is really sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Her order, Nipponzan Myohoji, has one prime focus: to walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very small order with a very big vision,'' Sister
Denise said. ``Whoever's working for peace and justice, we're
walking, supporting, praying with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy Hutto said she met Sister Jun on another walk and traveled
here from Berkeley, Calif. ``She's so solid,'' Ms. Hutto said. On
the previous walk, ``I gravitated toward the calmest thing, and
that was Jun-san.''
</P>
<P>
   Heads turned and cars slowed as the group processed along
Broadway. One walker, Greg Brown, said there had been taunts in the
past. But on Sunday, there were approving honks, and thumbs-up
signals.
</P>
<P>
   The walkers are a diverse group. ``I'm a former newspaper
reporter,'' said Sister Denise, 38. ``But then it came to me: you
should live as if your faith is a matter of life and death.'' So
she ``started a journey'' that led to her becoming a monk eight
years ago..
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see this as a protest,'' she said. ``It's about
connecting, changing our hearts _ that will bring down the prison
walls.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a 20-year-old from upstate New York who works at a record
store, told of vigils outside various prisons. ``We'd bow to the
guards, and a few bowed back, which was cool,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Audrey Stewart, 20, lives in Ithaca and paints houses to support
her peace work. ``Prisons are the next version of slavery,'' she
said, voicing special contempt for private prisons. ``Once you
reduce people to moneymaking objects, all concern for their rights
goes out the window.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Hutto, 35, is a recovering drug user. ``To walk and
pray,'' she said, ``is very healing and grounding.''
</P>
<P>
   Some are Buddhists, but not all. But the chants Sister Jun
leads, the spirit she brings, are Buddhist in nature. ``The
Buddhist way,'' Sister Jun said, ``is we have no fences. To put
people in cages is not a solution.''

`GISELLE` ACCENTS ROMANTICISM'S PLAY ON REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.) (sw) 
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The San Francisco Ballet has never included
``Giselle'' in its permanent repertory. As if to compensate for
this not-so-dreadful omission, Helgi Tomasson's new staging for the
company has an opera house grandeur that ``Giselle'' deserves but
rarely receives.
</P>
<P>
   The production's spectacular scale, with its large corps,
unusual play with space in the decor, stage machinery (with sylphs
whizzing in the air) and brilliantly presented dramatic detail,
brings out the essence of ``Giselle'': the difference between the
real and the supernatural.
</P>
<P>
   ``Giselle'' in these two aspects is the epitome of 19th-century
Romantic ballet. Created in 1841 at the Paris Opera as the
brainchild of the poet Theophile Gautier, the ballet was not the
first to use this two-part Romantic formula. If the work has
survived (although modified by choreographers over 158 years), it
is thanks not only to Adolphe Adam's landmark score but to its
perfect summary of Romanticism's real-supernatural dichotomy.
</P>
<P>
   This is a delineation that Tomasson's staging, presented through
this weekend with the premiere on Thursday night, emphasized so
clearly at the War Memorial Opera House here.
</P>
<P>
   The village of Act I when Giselle, the peasant girl, is seduced
by Albrecht, a count in disguise, is not the usual intimate scene.
Its local color extends to the vistas of the fields beyond the
village where the folk harvest their grapes.
</P>
<P>
   Open space thus greets the viewer in Act I and a mysteriously
closed forest begins Act II, when Giselle joins the spirits, or
wilis, ghosts of jilted maidens who died before their wedding day.
</P>
<P>
   In this open-closed contrast the Danish designer Mikael Melbye
has offered a startling and persuasive twist on viewer
expectations. His German village looks so realistic that it is not
surprising to learn that Melbye has based his scenery on the real
town of Thuringen in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Like the 1841 decor, his includes a castle in the background. It
is modeled on Schloss Burgk, which still exists in the town.
Moreover the realism is enhanced by the three-dimensional effect of
a set with built houses and a fence, not painted decor.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast there is none of the usual clearing in the woods at
the beginning of Act II. A row of gnarled trees separates only
after Myrtha, queen of the wilis, enters.
</P>
<P>
   The gala opening on Thursday was a tribute to the company's
outgoing chairwoman, Patricia Hellman, whose family made a major
contribution to the $750,000 production. The performance was led by
Lucia Lacarra and Yuri Possokhov while the Friday cast was led by
Tina LeBlanc and Roman Rykine.
</P>
<P>
   If some principals need to reach for more depth, Tomasson has
done wonders with the corps, moved the action quickly along and
infused it with dramatic detail.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Ballet apparently staged a single performance
of the work in 1947 under Anton Dolin's direction. The Tomasson
contribution is evident first in the dramatic logic. The wilis bend
and rise as they enter, as if coming out of the earth. Giselle
retreats into her grave at the end by sinking in the deep curtsy
performed by the corps. Suddenly she is sucked into the wings and
Albrecht, rising, returns to lie by her grave in tender melancholy.
</P>
<P>
   Tomasson has rechoreographed some of the ensembles in Act I
distinctively and the peasant pas de deux has been replaced by two
men and three women. The music by Friedrich Borgmuller,
interpolated in 1841 for this passage, has been augmented now by a
Borgmuller piano piece (``Shepherd's Return''), orchestrated by the
company's conductor, Emil de Cou.
</P>
<P>
   This extra music goes to the impressive Kristin Long for a solo,
while the traditional music is used for virtuoso display from the
men, Guennadi Nedviguine and Gonzalo Garcia. The latter pulled off
a new bravura step, a composite of a barrel turn and revoltade turn
in the air, while Nedviguine was splendid in his classical style.
The women, who included Claudia Alfieri and Vanessa Zahorian,
dazzled as well.
</P>
<P>
   It is a bit of a jolt to see stylistic references to
Bournonville in this pas de cinque. Nothing however prepares one
for the completely new interpolated brief pas de deux that Tomasson
has created in Act I before Hilarion, Albrecht's rival, reveals the
count's identity.
</P>
<P>
   Tomasson's choreography is neo-classical, with a modern attack,
and Giselle, leaning on Albrecht's arm, has a high arabesque that
looks Balanchinian. The music comes from an 1854 edition of the
score used by de Cou. Whether this musical passage was ever staged
is doubtful but it exists in that copy of the score.
</P>
<P>
   The Romantic expressiveness in this production comes from the
exquisitely coached mime. Ms. Lacarra portrayed a beautiful wisp of
a village girl in Act I, with a harrowingly effective mad scene.
But her technique faltered unacceptably. In Act I, she could not
hop on toe and her footwork was too blurred in the diagonals of
turns. In Act II she missed the deep arabesques and steady balances
that are Giselle's signature.
</P>
<P>
   Her Albrecht, Possokhov, seemed deliberately reined in until a
sudden passionate burst of yearning colored his performance from
the end of Act I to the end. Rykine was obviously directed in the
same way and while dancing more elegantly on Friday, did not have
believable rapport with Ms. LeBlanc, whose beautifully danced
Giselle needs only more depth.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Damian Smith was a handsome, mean Hilarion, with
Muriel Maffre as a splendid, icy Myrtha. On Friday, Peter
Brandenhoff was handsome and meaner and Sabina Allemann's vigorous
Myrtha had its own splendor.

OLAZABAL SHOWS HIS CLASS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ The Masters and the moment belonged to Jose Maria
Olazabal. The man so hobbled he couldn't walk in 1996 was striding
_ no, gliding _ up the 18th fairway on Sunday, a two-shot lead in
his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   This was the crown jewel in Olazabal's comeback from a
career-threatening foot injury and, accordingly, a majestic crowd
stood ready to receive him up at the green.
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal made them wait, though out of concern not conceit.
</P>
<P>
   The Spaniard didn't want the courage of his playing partner,
Greg Norman, to get lost in his own coronation. And so, incredibly,
indelibly, Olazabal stopped until Norman, lagging behind so as not
to rattle his friend's stage, caught up.
</P>
<P>
   Together they walked up to receive their due, the disappointment
of yet another near miss here by Norman displaced by the most
eloquent show of sportsmanship since Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa
exchanged hugs and handshakes and air kisses during their home run
derby last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I say? I was in a situation (Sunday), you know, that
I wanted to win the green jacket,'' said Olazabal, who closed with
a 1-under-par 71 to win his second Masters title. ``But at the same
time, I was playing with Greg and from my point of view, he
deserves the jacket as much as anybody else. I knew (at 18) he was
facing a tough moment again, and I think it was nice for me to wait
for him and walk the last few yards together.''
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal's nickname, Chemma, must be Spanish for classy.
</P>
<P>
   The sweeping crowds that fanned out over Augusta National Sunday
were firmly behind Norman from the start. He was the people's
choice, his every birdie _ and his one eagle, on the par-5 13th _
eliciting roars that jumped like flames as his scores were posted
on the giant leaderboards all over the course.
</P>
<P>
   Norman, 44, is three years removed from his career nadir _ a
six-stroke, final-round collapse that handed Nick Faldo his third
Masters title. To hear him talk, a lot of wonderful things have
happened since then.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, from the second Norman walked purposefully into view
here Sunday, it was obvious he'd have an easier time shaking his
shadow than the memory of that long afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear from the silence that hung in the air, heavy as
humidity, whenever a drive of his didn't split the fairway or an
approach shot of his didn't dissect the glass-hard greens. Make no
mistake: The gargantuan gallery following Norman was red-faced not
as a result of the sun's rays but from holding its collective
breath.
</P>
<P>
   When Norman bogeyed the par-3 12th and three-putted from the
fringe for a bogey on No.14 after carding his eagle on 13, the
sense of foreboding was palpable.
</P>
<P>
   The 13th green was also the scene of a Hallmark moment. Norman
made his best iron shot of the week count by draining a 25-foot
putt for a 3 to take the lead outright at 7 under.
</P>
<P>
   Norman's nirvana lasted all of 60 seconds, or however long it
took Olazabal to step up and sink a 21-foot birdie putt to match
Norman at 7 under. Norman, recognizing in Olazabal's stroke a
challenge received and put away, pointed at Olazabal like a
basketball player acknowledging the teammate who had fed him the
ball for the easy basket.
</P>
<P>
   In a matter of speaking, the two competitors were on the same
team, united behind a Red Cross flag.
</P>
<P>
   If Norman couldn't win _ the three-time Masters bridesmaid faded
to third this time, three shots behind Olazabal _ it was only
fitting that 1998 champion Mark O'Meara slipped the green jacket
around Olazabal's shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   When Norman underwent right-shoulder surgery shortly after the
Masters last year, Olazabal was one of a paltry few among his peers
who sent Norman a note wishing him well in his recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Most professional athletes aren't spiteful, just self-absorbed.
So when Mark McGwire seeks out the family of Roger Maris after
hitting his 63rd home run and Olazabal seeks out Norman before
clinching his second major, you applaud the man more than the
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ollie has a good heart,'' Norman said. ``He takes time to make
sure you're OK. He takes time to walk across the putting green, the
locker room, to say hello. He cares about the things that go on
around him.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind every act of kindness, there is another. When Olazabal
was recovering from a pinched nerve in his back that delivered
intense pain to his right foot, Norman checked in on him regularly.
This softer, compassionate side Norman kept largely under wraps for
the longest time. To his peers and the public he was a
swashbuckling hustler, the Rupert Murdoch of the links.
</P>
<P>
   Then a 46-year-old icon took one Masters title from Norman, an
Augusta native chipped in from 140 feet to snatch another right out
from under his nose and he just plain dropped a third.
</P>
<P>
   The grace with which Norman handled his 1996 collapse opened
people's eyes and then their hearts. All of the sudden he was seen
as not just a great golfer but a pretty decent man.
</P>
<P>
   Just like Olazabal, as it turns out. &QL;

COMMENTARY: THE EAGER BEAVERS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs last graf for rewriting)  By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After four of the blossoming Japanese cherry trees
on the edge of the Tidal Basin mysteriously were hacked down, park
police laid in wait at night to catch the vandals.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, the midnight marauders reappeared: A band of three
beavers, sharp front teeth at the ready, swam up out of the murky
shallows to ``harvest'' the trees again in the furtherance of their
unauthorized federal dam project.
</P>
<P>
   This led to a fierce clash of interests between
environmentalists (``Save the trees!'') and animal-rights activists
(``Save the beavers!''). One lesson: In natural struggles for
survival, as in political relations between powers, painful
priorities must be imposed and ameliorating compromises made.
</P>
<P>
   Another lesson taught in the defense of Beauty (the blossoms in
their springtime glory) against the attack of Truth (the beavers
instinctively demonstrating the validity of their work ethic) was
this: Do not demonize your opponents when they want to let you lose
with honor.
</P>
<P>
   Let us consider the way President Clinton handled the visit of
China's remarkable prime minister, Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu's goal was to gain our support for China's admission to the
World Trade Organization. He was willing to make some concessions
about opening his protected markets to U.S. exporters, but
unwilling to stop the campaign to crush all attempts to form a
democracy in Communist China.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's goal was to accept the commercial easements _ while
paying lip service to human rights _ and make the deal. But at the
last minute he double-crossed his own trade negotiators and
embarrassed Zhu by scuttling the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   John Sweeney, head of the AFL-CIO, who wants protection from
cheap Chinese goods, is why. In years past, Clinton could afford to
ignore Sweeney's protectionism, as well as liberal Democrats who
have seen how trade has led only to more repression. That's because
he had the support of business-dominated Republicans on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   But now that callous business-is-business support is eroding.
The stolen nuclear secrets and the funneling of Chinese money into
his stolen election make Republicans nervous, thereby giving
Sweeney much more leverage on Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In scuttling the deal, Clinton needed someone to blame. It
couldn't be Zhu; he had come a long way on trade. Couldn't be labor
or human-rights liberals who saved him from removal. Certainly
couldn't be himself, although his easy assumption of GOP dogma that
trade would lead to freedom had backfired. He decided to take the
vast-right-wing-conspiracy route.
</P>
<P>
   The culprit? ``The anti-China crowd in America,'' he said, had a
notion ``that if someone wants to have a relationship with us, they
should agree with us about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   How's that for polarizing rhetoric?
</P>
<P>
   He has now divided Americans who think about China at all into
``the anti-China crowd'' of simpletons vs. _ who? The mirror image
would be ``a pro-China crowd in America that thinks that if we want
to have a relationship with someone, we should agree with them
about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Such foolish oratory makes impossible a realistic American
attitude toward China. It invites us back to the who-lost-China,
pre-Nixon days of isolation and hostility.
</P>
<P>
   We who are now labeled by our president ``the anti-China crowd''
are indeed anti-Communist, but believe we must deal with Beijing
across a range of fronts, using trade and cultural contacts as
levers for diplomatic compromise and political progress. Trade is
good, but it is not all, and we have seen in China and Russia how
its profits can be misused by a power elite to stunt the growth of
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   We can combat China's penetration of our labs without rancor,
and expect Beijing to understand an improvement of our surveillance
of their military. But we should exhibit outrage at the subversion
of our political process with foreign money; that's beyond the pale
of national competition, and when added to sustained cultural
aggression in Tibet and missile intimidation of Taiwan, causes
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-China crowd disagrees. (See? It's so easy to pin a
pejorative label on opponents.) We'll have to await a new president
for a subtly realistic approach that China will respect.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the anti-beaver crowd has humanely trapped two of the
predators of our cherry trees. The eager rodents will be released
in the wilds of Maryland. Tidal Basin blossoms are now safer.
Spring is possible.

OLAZABAL CAPTURES SECOND MASTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Just three years ago Jose Maria Olazabal was
virtually confined to his home in Fuenterrabia in northern Spain,
his future in golf uncertain because of debilitating problems with
his feet. He watched the Masters on television, saw his friend Greg
Norman fall apart in the pressures of the final round, and made a
silent promise that someday he'd return.
</P>
<P>
   Paired with Norman in Sunday's final round of the 63d Masters at
the Augusta National GC, Olazabal made the monumental trek up
golf's most celebrated hill to the 18th green secure in the
knowledge that he would be helped into a green jacket by defender
Mark O'Meara. There were times when Olazabal couldn't walk, let
alone play the game he loved. Now he had gone full circle.
</P>
<P>
   When Olazabal sank his final putt to complete a magnificent tour
of these hallowed grounds in 8-under par numbers of
70-66-73-71_280, he had won the Masters for the second time with a
gritty performance in fiercely unkind winds that tested the
players' character as the leaderboard became a listing of many of
the game's top stars. Olazabal's effort represented a triumph of
the human spirit.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of Norman was a constant, and he was returning from
inactivity following shoulder surgery shortly after the Masters a
year ago. If he had seen his six-shot lead over Nick Faldo three
years ago go by the boards on a disheartening afternoon, he
returned to the cheers of the crowds and threatened to pull it off
until he couldn't rise to the occasion one more time in the final
round of a major.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it all came down to the par-5 13th, where Davis Love
pulled his tee shot into Rae's Creek, and even though he salvaged
par, he saw time was running out.
</P>
<P>
   Just moments later, Norman found the putting surface in two, and
hit a curling 25-foot right-to-left putt for an eagle. Olazabal,
who was on the green in three and could have dropped two shots in
what had become match play, rolled in his 21-foot putt for birdie.
</P>
<P>
   This set the table for a final run, and when it ended Olazabal
had another Masters win, to go with his first five years ago,
before what originally was diagnosed as a foot injury was
discovered to be a lower back ailment and threatened his career.
There was a time he couldn't get out of bed, and he was inactive
for 18 months. But, ``I try not to think about what happened in the
past,'' Olazabal said.
</P>
<P>
   The final tally showed Olazabal winning by two shots over Love
(71), three over Norman (73), and four over Bob Estes (72) and
Steve Pate (73). Five players were tied for the lead on the front
nine, including the game's hottest player, David Duval (70_285),
who faded with a double bogey on the 11th, Lee Westwood (71_285),
Lee Janzen (76_288), Love, and Norman.
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal, who led after Rounds 2 and 3, saw the lead slip away
with bogeys on the third, fourth, and fifth holes before he
regrouped with a birdie 2 on the sixth. From there until he rolled
in a 3-foot putt on the 18th, he played in 4 under, with birdies on
the 10th, 13th, and 16th. When Olazabal holed out on the 18th,
Norman warmly embraced him. They'd remained tight friends through
their surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   Love, who made a significant breakthrough when he won the 1997
PGA Championship at Winged Foot as a rainbow appeared, had hoped
for better. After making the turn in level par 36, he made a
remarkable par on the par-5 13th after he pulled his tee shot into
the water, rolling in a 25-foot putt to save par.
</P>
<P>
   On the par-3 16th, Love hit his tee shot into the rough left of
the green. His chip shot hit the green, took a definite turn to the
right and slowly rolled some 20 feet back to the cup for a birdie.
Love was alive and breathing. He would par the 17th and 18th, but
Olazabal would birdie the 16th when he hit a 6-iron to 3 feet.
</P>
<P>
   That birdie put him in control, and after his tee shot on the
par-4 17th caught a bit of the Eisenhower tree, he was able to hit
a 5-iron second shot on and get down in two to take a two-shot lead
to the 18th and take the victory stroll.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great day for me,'' said Olazabal. ``I'm very proud of
myself. When I was at my lowest I never thought I was going to play
golf again.''

   KOSOVO-RUSSIA (Moscow) _ The NATO bombing of Yugoslavia may or
may not free the Kosovars; but a thousand miles from Belgrade it
has had a profoundly liberating effect. After eight long-suffering
years, it's once again acceptable _ even de rigeur _ for Russians

   TERMLIMITS-POLITICS (Spokane, Wash.) _ Once seen as the poster
child for the term-limits movement, which seemed to be catching
fire in 1994 but has quieted down in the wake of adverse court
rulings and flush economic times, Rep. George Nethercutt, the man
who defeated Speaker Thomas Foley five years ago, is one of 58
members of Congress who have set a limit on their time in office,
and one of 10 House members whose pledges come due next fall. And
of those 10, all but one of them Republicans, at least four are
currently wavering on their pledges, driven in part by the urgings
of party leaders and the high stakes involved in the 2000 races:
with the Democrats needing just six seats to retake control of
Congress, every seat is vital, and Republicans seem loathe to
sacrifice strong incumbents on the altar of the term-limits cause.

RED SOX FINALLY TASTE DEFEAT 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-DEVIL RAYS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ He was the last option, but not the
solution.
</P>
<P>
   Down to his final out Sunday afternoon, Red Sox manager Jimy
Williams asked a lame man not to walk, but to pinch hit.
</P>
<P>
   But there would be no miracle finish, the kind that has made
Kirk Gibson a highlight reel immortal. Nomar Garciaparra, who at
the time was still a candidate to go on the disabled list with a
strained left hamstring, struck out, dropping the curtain on a 5-4
loss to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays that ended a five-game winning
streak and the distinction of being the last undefeated team in the
big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in a tough situation,'' said Jeff Frye, whose
seventh-inning single after Damon Buford's double had brought the
Sox all the way back from a 4-0 deficit created by two-run home
runs by Fred McGriff and Mike DiFelice in the first two innings off
wild Sox starter Pat Rapp.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hadn't hit for a while,'' Frye said. ``To expect him to do
that would have been tough. I mean, we all know he's superhuman,
but I'm just being realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, sent to the plate with pinch hitter Scott Hatteberg
aboard after a two-out walk, went down swinging against closer
Roberto Hernandez, who got away with a hanging slider after
Garciaparra had run the count to 2 and 2, fouling off three
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a hitter who swings at everything in the strike zone,''
Hernandez said after saving Tampa Bay's first home win. ``Luckily,
this one was out of the zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatteberg was the last of 14 runners stranded Sunday by the Sox,
who left the bases loaded once and two men on in five other
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, the last of three pinch hitters used by Williams in
the inning, said the manager told him during the eighth inning he
might be asked to hit.
</P>
<P>
   Did Garciaparra feel the sore hammy during the at-bat?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said. ``I felt a strikeout.''
</P>
<P>
   Having come back once to tie, the Sox were trying to answer the
eighth-inning home run surrendered by reliever Derek Lowe to Danny
Clyburn, who in five previous at-bats had struck out three times
and grounded into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Clyburn, formerly an outfielder in the Orioles' system who hit
his only previous major league home run off Tim Wakefield last
September in Fenway Park, drove a 1-and-1 pitch over the
center-field fence with two out.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe, who didn't give up a home run in 53 relief appearances
last season, now has been taken deep twice in his last two
appearances. The first one was a no-harm, no-foul number by McGriff
with two outs in the ninth inning of a 4-1 Sox win Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   This one caused collateral damage. ``He got beat with his best
pitch,'' pitching coach Joe Kerrigan said. ``He got beat with his
sinker. He went down like a man. He's going to be pitching a lot
more in situations like that, so he'd better get used to having a
short memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's too good a pitcher to let this one linger.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe said the sinker he threw started outside but, instead of
diving, came back over the plate like a cut fastball. ``Horrible,''
Lowe said. ``There are a lot of pluses to pitching in the eighth or
ninth inning, but if you give up a home run, you can be the goat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to getting back out there. But you know,
I've given up seven home runs with the Red Sox, and four of them
have come here _ two last year (as a starter), two this year. I
can't wait to get out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Clyburn's home run, the Sox bullpen had been as coldly
efficient as it had been in the previous five games. The only
difference Sunday was that there were two new contributors. Lefty
Rheal Cormier struck out the side (including Jose Canseco and
McGriff on six pitches in the fifth) and had four Ks in all in his
two innings, while Kip Gross retired all three batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   Cormier, coming back from elbow surgery, hadn't pitched in a
major league game in two years. Gross, coming back from Japan,
hadn't pitched in a big-league game since 1992. And neither had
taken the mound for the Sox since the last week of spring training
in Florida, nearly two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both those kids pitched great,'' Williams said, ``considering
they hadn't pitched in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Offerman, who has been an automatic two hits a game for the
Sox, singled and scored on Mike Stanley's base hit for the Sox'
first run in the third, then hit a bases-loaded single in the sixth
to make it 4-3. When Frye tied it in the seventh, Williams already
was thinking ahead to the ninth, and Nomar.
</P>
<P>
   Williams first used Brian Daubach, who opened the ninth by
striking out. Frye tapped to the mound for the second out before
Hatteberg, batting for Jason Varitek, walked on a full count. By
then, Garciaparra already was on deck, in place of Donnie Sadler,
who had a single in his last 11 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to hit a gapper, send up a good hitter and give
it a shot with one out to go,'' Williams said. ``He's been taking
batting practice.''
</P>
<P>
   By using Garciaparra, Williams was essentially eliminating the
chance that the shortstop would be going on the DL. The Sox could
have backdated Garciaparra on the DL to last Wednesday, the day he
sustained the injury running the bases in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put that Ouija board out there, it's in your hands,
All-State,'' Williams said of playing Garciaparra. ``For me, it was
the right thing to do in today's game. It just didn't work.''

QBS COULD BE THROWBACK TO CLASS OF '83 
</HEADLINE>
 DRAFT-QUARTERBACKS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It's all guesswork, of course. Oh, the guys with the
stopwatches have judged the quarterbacks' arm strength, their speed
in the 40, and how quickly they release the ball. But even they
don't know for sure what they have.
</P>
<P>
   What they do know _ or at least think they know _ is that when
the first two rounds of Saturday's National Football League draft
are over, at least five and possibly as many as eight QBs will have
been selected.
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, could make it the largest QB class since 1983,
when six signal-callers were selected in the first round. Those
Super Six QBs thus far have made 11 Super Bowl appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a whole, this class is excellent,'' said Philadelphia
Eagles director of football operations Tom Modrak, whose team might
select a QB with its first-round pick (second overall). ``There's
quality and there's depth, which is unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Those quarterbacks considered in the elite group are, in
alphabetical order, Kentucky's Tim Couch, Central Florida's Daunte
Culpepper, Syracuse's Donovan McNabb, UCLA's Cade McNown, and
Oregon's Akili Smith.
</P>
<P>
   After that, there are Ohio State's Joe Germaine, Washington's
Brock Huard, Kansas State's Michael Bishop, Tulane's Shaun King,
and Miami's Scott Covington. So one can see why this is being
referred to as a deep position.
</P>
<P>
   Depth is part of the reason comparisons are being made to the
Class of 1983. But it will take some extraordinary performances to
match that group, which included John Elway, Dan Marino, Jim Kelly,
Todd Blackledge, Ken O'Brien, and Tony Eason.
</P>
<P>
   But mistakes were made in 1983, just as they will be Saturday.
While Elway was the clear-cut choice as the No. 1 quarterback in
'83, there is no such player this season. Couch, who left Kentucky
a year early, is regarded as the slight front-runner and the
most-likely No. 1 pick by the Cleveland Browns. But Smith, a
6-foot-2 1/2-inch, 223-pounder who has what many scouts believe is
the best arm, has been climbing in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday Couch worked out for the Browns for the second time, and
afterward coach Chris Palmer said he was impressed _ but had not
decided between Couch and Smith. ``I would say they're neck and
neck coming down the stretch,'' he told the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Even Elway, one of the best quarterbacks of all time, did not
have a smooth journey at the start. The Baltimore Colts picked him
first, but they were so bad that Elway threatened to make baseball
his full-time career unless the Colts traded him, which they did _
to Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The second QB selected in '83 was not Marino, another Hall of
Famer in waiting, but Blackledge, a then highly regarded player
from Penn State whom Kansas City took with the seventh pick.
Blackledge lasted six seasons with the Chiefs and never was a
full-time starter.
</P>
<P>
   Marino was the next-to-last pick of the first round, chosen 27th
by the Dolphins. One of the teams passing up Marino was the
Patriots, who chose Eason out of Illinois with the 15th pick,
rather than the University of Pittsburgh's Marino. (Eason was a big
reason the Patriots made it to the Super Bowl in 1986.)
</P>
<P>
   This year's selections will be just as difficult. Couch?
Culpepper? McNown? McNabb? Smith? Who really knows?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost as if you could take a magician's hat and put the
names in there on slips of paper and pull one out,'' said
first-year Eagles coach Andy Reid. ``They're that close.''
</P>
<P>
   But they do have some different styles. Couch, Culpepper, and to
some extent Smith have more of the classic drop-back style that the
traditionalists revere.
</P>
<P>
   McNabb, coming out of Syracuse's multi-function offense, is more
like former Colorado star Kordell Stewart of the Steelers, a player
some believe is the prototype for the next generation of QBs, more
of an athlete than a pure thrower.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is McNown, who has the quality all coaches like,
which is that he finds ways to win games despite measurements by
the scouts that don't stand out.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone doubts the worth of that, remember a guy named Flutie
out of Boston College? Or the 1990s version of Flutie, Jake
Plummer, who came out of Arizona State and got the Cardinals into
the playoffs last season?
</P>
<P>
   Other factors also must be considered. Take Smith. Despite only
one full year's experience as a starter at Oregon, he is hardly a
kid. He'll be 24 in August and spent three years playing minor
league baseball in the Pirates organization.
</P>
<P>
   Or Culpepper, a ``genetic freak,'' as his Central Florida coach,
Mike Kruczek, calls him. ``At 6-5, 250 pounds, the guy can do a 4.5
40,'' he said. ``You don't see quarterbacks like that.''
</P>
<P>
   As the NFL prepares for a new century, the quarterbacks who will
succeed, say the experts, must be of a different breed than those
of a generation ago. They must have strong arms, quick feet, and
move with the speed and grace of a running back.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, those types of quarterbacks would have been welcomed
in 1983, but with bigger, quicker linebackers and linemen these
days, quarterbacks must be quicker, not bigger, to avoid them.
</P>
<P>
   Culpepper would seem to fit a lot of molds, but he seems to have
been downgraded because of the lack of quality opposition that he
faced the last two years. Either that, or because scouts don't know
how to classify a QB that big and fast.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps those people need to use the ``eye test,'' the way Hall
of Fame Jets QB Joe Namath did one afternoon last fall. ``I just
saw this kid on TV named Daunte Culpepper,'' Namath said on Pete
Rose's nationally syndicated radio talk show. ``He's from the
University of Central Florida and he's the best passer I've seen in
I can't remember how long, expect for maybe Dan Marino.''
</P>
<P>
   Culpepper makes it even simpler. ``I've told all the pro people
I've talked to that if they want someone who is going to help them
win games, they should pick me,'' he said. ``And that's what it's
all about, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately it is about whether the QBs can win, which won't be
known for another four or five years, if not longer.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the evaluation process is more subjective, more open
to debate. When the Class of 1999 holds a five- or 10-year reunion,
chances are only a few of the first tier of QBs will have made a
significant impact, and that someone picked in the third, fourth,
or fifth round will be the reigning star.
</P>
<P>
   What no one seems to be debating is that one way or another the
QB Class of '99 has no shortage of candidates for such roles of
stardom.

NO. 13 NOT LUCKY ENOUGH FOR NORMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Greg Norman was on the 13th hole, a mere stroke
from the lead, some 198 yards from the pin of the par-5 hole.
Norman then took a 4-iron, made his second swing on the hole, and
what ensued ``was one the best shots I've hit in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   This was better than Norman could have scripted. Or worse. The
ball flew directly at the stick, rolling some 20 feet beyond, a
straight downhill putt. Norman struck the ball with his putter. It
was sent perfectly into the center of the cup. The eagle had
landed. Perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   Norman now was in the lead, a stroke to the good of the other
player on the 13th green, Spain's Jose Maria Olazabal. An eagle on
the 13th on Sunday afternoon more often than not is the lethal blow
of the Masters, particularly when it is struck by one of the
players in the last twosome.
</P>
<P>
   Strange.
</P>
<P>
   Norman never smiled when his eagle landed. Not even a hint of a
smile. He tipped his cap to the mad roar, that surge of electricity
that sizzled down in that far corner of Augusta National, but that
was all. Unknown to him, pal Nick Price was on the 18th green when
the red 7 was posted by Norman's name on the scoreboard here, and
Price stopped his task on the green and stood and clapped for
approximately 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   But the look on Norman's face was almost grim.
</P>
<P>
   More work to do, that look said. Or maybe the look said, ``Oh
no, I'm back here again, with a chance to win the Masters.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman's caddy had walked over to him and said, ``You knew you
were going to make that, didn't you?'' And Norman had agreed. So
confident, so sure, so certain. Followed by that look that said
none of the above.
</P>
<P>
   Norman's moment of glory was precisely that, a moment. He led
the Masters by a stroke, but that lead could be measured in seconds
because that is how long it lasted. Perhaps 60 seconds, or maybe
70, after Norman's eagle, Olazabal stepped up to his ball and made
his birdie putt. Norman and the Spaniard were tied; it was almost
as if the look on Norman's face said it would be too good to last.
</P>
<P>
   When Olazabal made his putt on 13, Norman recalled thinking, ``I
knew the game was on. I never doubted that he would make his. It
was just the way the thing was building up; it was quite
extraordinary.'' Now, a reason for the look. Norman knew.
</P>
<P>
   Norman would have to know, of course. There can be few who read
golf stories who don't know that Norman has been close to winning
the Masters three, four, five, six times and never has. Sometimes
because of the gods. Sometimes because of other golfers. Sometimes
because of himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that I've climbed a pretty good mountain (Sunday),''
Norman would say, after it ended as it always has ended here,
unhappily on the scoreboard. ``Not a molehill, but a mountain. I
feel good about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Masters flew away from Norman almost as quickly as his eagle
flew in. On the 14th, his 7-iron from 153 yards ``landed 8 yards
further than I wanted'' and skidded over the green. Norman chose to
putt from about 15 feet off the green, but there was a rise between
his ball and the hole, and Norman was fearful of going over it too
fast ``and the ball'd be off the green.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little apprehensive there, gunning it down there,''
said Norman. His hesitancy was obvious, his putt was well short,
and he missed the par putt. One stroke was quickly gone, and his
tie for the lead, too. ``But that's probably my first
not-going-through-the-ball stroke that I've made all week, and
that's why I three-putted from the fringe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 15th was not good. Some might choose to place Norman's play
on the 14th and his play on the par-5 15th in the pantheon of his
other Sunday horrors here and they might be right. On his drive,
``I tried to hit a hard smoker, turn it off the (newly planted)
trees (on the right), but I caught it a little bit high on the
driver face, and that's why it didn't turn over.''
</P>
<P>
   When he reached his ball, ``there was some mud on it,'' and he
chose to lay up and not go for the green in 2. But his cautious
approach betrayed him because when he hit his approach from 94
yards out with a sand wedge ``the ball just carried a little bit
right and went into the bunker. I just wasn't meant to make 5
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly when he couldn't hit the green from 94 yards with a
sand wedge. As it was, Olazabal promptly ended matters by parring
the 15th to Norman's bogey, and then making a birdie on the par-3
16th.
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal, a friend of Norman's (each had to overcome physical
woes in the last several years), said Norman ``deserves a green
jacket as much as any other golfer.'' For certain, Norman deserves
plaudits for his sheer courage in getting back to the top of the
leaderboard when that particular leaderboard has toppled over onto
his psyche so many times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel pretty good,'' said the Australian. ``I feel pretty
good within myself to do what I did. Don't take that the wrong way.
I'm still disappointed I didn't win and sad I didn't win.''
</P>
<P>
   He is a newer man since his total collapse to Nick Faldo on
Sunday three years ago, a man who has found balance in his life,
his family, too, and it is not a life strictly of golf and money.
``I'll be honest,'' he said, ``I was more disappointed in '96 than
I am right now. No question about that. Ninety-six was a totally
different animal tournament-wise, person-wise, and result-wise than
this was.''
</P>
<P>
   If he had to put a percentage on his feelings, he said, ``I feel
80 percent success, 20 percent failure. That's the way I feel right
now, whereas back in '96, there was probably 90 percent
disappointment, 99 percent, maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   For sure, he concluded, no matter how his feelings of success
and disappoinment in 1999 compared to 1996, ``There was a heck of a
lot more difference leading up to it (this year).'' This time,
Norman seemed to enjoy his Masters experience, instead of being
tormented by it.
</P>
<P>
   Except, perhaps, for that moment when his eagle putt dropped
into the cup on 13.

PUZZLING SONICS CARVE UP LAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Those still trying to get a solid read on
the Sonics might have better luck solving a Rubik's Cube.
</P>
<P>
   A 5,000-piece puzzle might even be less perplexing than this
team has been this season.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the riddle continued Sunday as the Sonics rolled
over the Los Angeles Lakers 113-109 at the Great Western Forum. How
does a team beat Western Conference powers Houston, Portland and
the Lakers, yet lose to sub-.500 teams such as Denver, Sacramento
and Vancouver in a 10-day span?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can figure out this team let me know,'' Sonics coach
Paul Westphal said. `` ... The good news is if we make the playoffs
we don't have to play Vancouver or Denver. It's just crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Sonics should play all their remaining 14
regular-season games against playoff-caliber teams and on national
television.
</P>
<P>
   As much as this season has been one big accident for the Sonics,
they came up with their strongest showing of the year in front of
the NBC cameras. The Sonics discarded the Lakers with balanced
scoring and energy that lately seems to be reserved for the better
teams.
</P>
<P>
   That at least bodes well for the postseason, with all the
injuries and poor performances the Sonics have endured.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like we can put together a string of victories and get
rolling,'' forward Vin Baker said. `` ... We're going to be very
dangerous (in the postseason). Even with our record, I don't think
teams want to see us in the first round.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics figured to gain steam after beating the NBA-leading
Portland Trail Blazers last Thursday. The victory, though, was
negated the next night when the Sonics suffered an embarrassing
road loss to the lowly Vancouver Grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Sonics responded with a season-high point total
while climbing back to the .500 mark. They are 18-18 and moved a
half game in front of Phoenix for the seventh seed in the
conference playoff race _ with the Suns visiting KeyArena
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our record doesn't indicate what type of team we are,''
swingman Dale Ellis said. ``We're getting better and better even
though our loss total is fairly high.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics' record hasn't been this bad since the 1991-92
season. However, Ellis could not have been more right Sunday.
Unlike most .500 clubs, the Sonics played the Lakers tough in every
facet of the game.
</P>
<P>
   They were most impressive during crunch time in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   With the game tied 88-88 and 3:41 remaining, the Sonics reeled
off a 10-2 run that Gary Payton finished with a fastbreak dunk. The
team's offense was in high gear, executing and hitting shots to
keep the Lakers at arm's length.
</P>
<P>
   The play that iced the game came with 59.6 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics collected a rebound off a missed free throw. Moments
later, Payton threw a lob pass to Baker for an emphatic dunk that
put the Sonics ahead 102-95.
</P>
<P>
   They made 11 of 14 free throws in the final minute to put away
the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics' defense was just as fierce, holding the Lakers to
one field goal for more than five minutes down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde team. Sometimes we come
to play. Sometimes we don't,'' Payton said. ``I don't know who we
are so we have to keep this consistent. Hopefully guys can keep
playing the way they've been playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal used an eight-man rotation, challenging his top guns to
carry the team. And they did.
</P>
<P>
   Payton finished with 33 points and nine assists, Baker had 27
points and eight rebounds, Hersey Hawkins aggressively pursued a
season-high 20 points and Detlef Schrempf added 14.
</P>
<P>
   Baker the most forceful in his third game back since returning
from injury. He attacked the basket and went right at and around
Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal, who quietly compiled a game-high 38
points.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the quickest he's been all year,'' Westphal said of
Baker. ``Earlier in the year he wasn't able to make those quick
moves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics were the aggressors most of the game. They led by as
many as 11 points in the second half. They trailed for only 30
seconds in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``On certain possessions and key points of the game, when we
felt we should have gotten to the ball, they beat us to it,'' Laker
guard Kobe Bryant said. ``They were a step quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   A testament to the Sonics' fervor was their work on the glass.
They beat the Lakers, 41-37, on the boards. The Lakers also were
hard-pressed to score easy baskets in transition against the
Sonics' defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Realistically, you get a lot more motivated against the
Houstons, Portlands and the Lakers,'' Hawkins said. ``Somehow we've
got to find a way to get up against the Vancouvers.''
</P>
<P>
   The only hairy situation happened before the game, when center
Olden Polynice complained of back spasms on the bus ride to the
arena. But trainer Frank Furtado treated him, and Polynice finished
with eight rebounds while helping to hold O'Neal to 18-for-30
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how tough it gets we have 14 games left and we have
a chance,'' Westphal said. ``Our destiny is in our own hands. I
know they're giving it all they have, and if they keep doing that
good things will happen.''

MARINERS NEED A-ROD BACK FAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Sitting in the Mariner clubhouse, Alex Rodriguez
looked like an accident in a Crayola crayon box.
</P>
<P>
   His golf shirt was lime green. His corduroy pants were kelly
green. The eye-offending combo would have made Martha Stewart
blanch.
</P>
<P>
   That Rodriguez had the nerve to wear this clashing get-up to the
Kingdome Sunday was a dead give-away of the shortstop's current
state of disrepair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be the drugs,'' first baseman David Segui said,
rolling his eyes at the major league sartorial faux pas committed
by the usually super-slick, Armani-clad Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Rodriguez said, attempting to defend himself. ``It's
green for the Masters.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's post-operative knee might have meant a few
doctor-ordered painkillers were on his training table. Three days
after arthroscopic surgery, he had the right to act and feel a
little woozy.
</P>
<P>
   And Rodriguez's teammates and friends could afford to tease the
young man. He will be back in action soon. The four to six weeks
Rodriguez is expected to miss with torn cartilege in his left knee
is probably an outside forecast, if you consider all the advice he
is getting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, there are a lot of doctors around here. Dr. Segui. Dr.
Martinez. Dr. Griffey,'' Rodriguez said, as if his older, wiser
teammates were all but telling him this knee surgery is a rite of
baseball passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was out two weeks when I had it done,'' Segui said,
remembering his 1997 knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``How long did it take you?'' Rodriguez asked Dave Henderson,
the former Mariner who made a point to stop by the Kingdome
clubhouse Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a different situation than you do. I had to get ready
for the playoffs. I was back in two weeks,'' Henderson said.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Rodriguez got up out of his chair and applied the
first bit of pressure on his tender leg by walking down the length
of the Mariner clubhouse _ without his crutches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch how fast I bounce back,'' Rodriguez said, hobbling off
to rehab.
</P>
<P>
   After an opening week like this past one, with Rodriguez
diagnosed with torn cartilege and then his impressive replacement
Carlos Guillen tearing an anterior cruciate ligament in a freaky
rundown play Saturday, the Mariners had to wonder. Is their middle
infield more of a jinxed minefield?
</P>
<P>
   Guillen, mind you, led the M's in spring, setting a club record
with 35 hits. He was ready to claim his place in the big leagues,
until Tony Phillips took him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like it. Ever,'' said Jamie Moyer,
the winning pitcher in the Mariners' 11-8 win over Oakland Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really an unfortunate thing, although Alex seems like
he's on his way back. I don't care what club you're talking about,
though. That's the key part of any club. Any team in baseball, top
to bottom, that's where your team is the strongest. Pitcher.
Catcher. Second base. Shortstop. Centerfield. That's where a lot of
the game is played, so when you're missing those two guys up the
middle, you're really hurting,'' Moyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, all those infield errors and not enough back-up led
to near disaster, especially at second and third base as Joey Cora
and Russ Davis struggled, each leading both leagues in errors by
position.
</P>
<P>
   We can only imagine what would have happened if Segui had not
vacuumed up so many errant throws and cherry-picked so many wicked
hops.
</P>
<P>
   But this season ... goodness gracious.
</P>
<P>
   The infield, and particularly the middle infield, was a bright
spot. It was supposed to be shored up stronger than the Ballard
locks, in large part because Guillen was turning out to be much
better than the no-name minor leaguer most locals assumed he was
when the M's got him from Houston in the Randy Johnson deal.
</P>
<P>
   But now, five games into the season, the entire middle infield
has been forced to take a knee.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Guillen hobbled into the clubhouse to join Rodriguez in
what Ken Griffey is calling the Kingdome MASH unit. Guillen, who
will have surgery in 10 days and faces up to nine months of rehab,
said he did not speak with Oakland leadoff hitter Tony Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips was booed at every at-bat but none of the Mariner
pitchers took a turn at returning the painful favor to him. To most
of the players, what Phillips did was within the realm of
reasonable force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony plays hard but he doesn't play dirty,'' Griffey said as
he helped detail how Guillen's knee was blown out not by Phillips'
collision but right before it, when Guillen planted his leg to try
to check the runner.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Mariners, they got lucky last season when
Cleveland's John Hart agreed to send David Bell to Seattle in
exchange for Cora. Now Cora is back home in Puerto Rico, managing
his local baseball team and the M's, thankfully, have Bell to eat
up the remaining 156 games in the season at second base.
</P>
<P>
   As for shortstop, the M's have brought up Giomar Guevara, who
started off the game by overthrowing Segui not once but twice for
two errors before settling down. They also have 31-year-old Domingo
Cedeno to share duties until Rodriguez comes back.
</P>
<P>
   As of now, with a ton of advice from his meddling but
well-meaning teammates and with Guillen out for the season,
Rodriguez seems willing to take the accelerated road to recovery.

DAUNTE'S INFERNO: HIS BURNING DESIRE 
</HEADLINE>
 DRAFT-CULPEPPER-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ The wait shouldn't be too long. Maybe an hour on
Saturday afternoon. And then Daunte Culpepper will know.
</P>
<P>
   That's the tough part, the not knowing. Oh, he's gotten some
idea. Maybe he'll go to Philadelphia, maybe Cincinnati, or
Baltimore. Not Cleveland. He's pretty certain of that. Maybe even
New Orleans, or some place he hadn't figured on, because someone in
some ``war room'' got antsy and had to have him on his team.
</P>
<P>
   Culpepper has been wondering for months now as he's flown to
different parts of the country, answering questions, getting
weighed and measured like a piece of prime beef. But he's no
different from Cade McNown, Tim Couch, Akili Smith, Donovan McNabb,
and the rest of the quarterback class of 1999, which is being
called the best in a generation by the draftniks.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it has required nothing more than getting out of bed
in the new house in south Orange County he has rented since January
and meeting some coach for a chalk session of Xs and Os.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Cincinnati Bengals coach Bruce Coslet did a couple
of weeks ago. He flew down to Orlando, sat down with Culpepper and
former Bengals quarterback Ken Anderson, and threw all sorts of
questions at him. What would he do on third and 22 from his 5 with
his protection breaking down? What would he do if he saw a
defensive back slip and fall out of the corner of his eye? Stay
with the play or wing it?
</P>
<P>
   So many questions. So much uncertainty. So many changes, such as
announcing his engagement to longtime girlfriend Kim Rhem in
January, and moving into the new house. Proving himself all over
again, as if he were some untested freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he has wanted to shout, Can't you see what I've done
the past two years? All those touchdowns, and all that yardage?
Can't you see that I was the Most Valuable Player in a postseason
all-star game?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Central Florida wasn't Florida State, and, yes, he screwed
up a few plays in a game against Auburn. He doesn't try to fool
anyone into thinking he is Superman, although at 6 feet 4 inches,
255 pounds, with 4.52 speed in the 40, sometimes people forget
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Genetically, God gave him everything,'' says Central Florida
coach Mike Kruczek, who played at Boston College and for the past
two years has watched Culpepper run his pro-style offense with the
skill and precision of a surgeon. ``He's got size, speed, and
brains. He's got the smarts. He's the prototype of the quarterback
of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Kruczek is obviously biased, but he believes that of the Class
of '99, Culpepper will be the biggest star. ``I don't see anyone
coming out that is better than Daunte,'' Kruczek said. ``McNown,
Couch, McNabb _ I think the upside to Daunte is greater than all of
them. I haven't followed the NFL closely, but I will from now on.''
</P>
<P>
   Culpepper says he has enjoyed the past four months. ``It's a
process I have to go through,'' he said. ``I'm very excited. It's
been a lot of fun, going to different places. It's been a great
ride for me.''
</P>
<P>
   New Philadelphia Eagles coach Andy Reid says he is interested in
Culpepper because of his physical makeup. ``He weighs 250, runs a
4.5 40, and thinks he can beat Michael Jordan in basketball,'' said
Reid with a laugh. ``He's intriguing.''
</P>
<P>
   Culpepper has not made the mistake of publicly expressing where
he wants to go. ``Besides,'' he says, ``I have no idea who really
is interested. Teams are not going to tell you their true
feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that he isn't interested. ``Sure, I want to know,'' he said.
``I'm anxious to start playing football again. That's what I love
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Culpepper's career at Central Florida ended on a bittersweet
note. Despite his marquee value and the Golden Knights' 9-2 record,
they didn't receive a bowl bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very big letdown for myself and the team,'' he said.
``We wanted to go to a bowl. You win nine games and don't go to a
bowl. It was a huge letdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Culpepper says he makes the step to the next level with an air
of confidence. ``I felt I was born to play football at the
professional level,'' he said. ``That's what I'm going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Eagles, Bengals, and Ravens have expressed the most
interest, Culpepper says he has not closed his mind to any
possibility. ``It will be a new system; I have to learn the game
over and prove myself over again,'' he said. ``But that's a
challenge I like. And one that I feel I'm ready to handle.''

UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON ENTICING YOUNG COMPUTER MAJORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH SCHUBERT  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Most University of Washington undergrads toil for two
nail-biting years before they can even apply for admission to the
highly competitive Computer Science and Engineering Department.
</P>
<P>
   But in a bid to lure superstar high school seniors to the
University of Washington instead of losing them to places such as
MIT or Stanford, the university will now let a few outstanding
freshmen directly into the major.
</P>
<P>
   The new early admissions program is crucial to getting the best
and the brightest computer scientists of the future, say UW
administrators who pushed for the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The University of Washington is unusual in that students
choose their majors relatively late, so if you have your heart set
on a competitive major, that can be a drawback when you're choosing
schools,'' said Ed Lazowska, chairman of the Computer Science and
Engineering Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want great Washington state students to feel like they
ought to choose an institution other than the UW.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a major as competitive as computer science, which
regularly turns away a good two-thirds of those who apply, some
students have reservations about giving freshmen coveted slots in
the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of me goes, `Well, that's not fair because I didn't have
that opportunity,''' said Erin Moore, a senior in computer science
who was admitted to the major a year after transferring from
Bellevue (Wash.) Community College. ``But I think it would be OK as
long as it doesn't push out other people.''
</P>
<P>
   This academic year, the computer science and computer
engineering department admitted a combined 148 students out of 355
who applied and enrolled 135.
</P>
<P>
   To students on the traditional route who may cry ``unfair,''
Lazowska and others say freshmen are limited to no more than 10
percent of those admitted. The freshmen also will have to meet
yet-to-be-determined ``satisfactory progress'' requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a trap door,'' said Denice Denton, dean of the UW
College of Engineering. ``What I would say to that other student
is, `Look, this student got this early admission and now they're
going to have to prove that they merit that.' ....It's not really a
special benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   The UW's Computer Science and Engineering Department ranks in
the top 10 in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of student computer science is hoping to lure to the UW
is someone like Steve Zhang. Under different circumstances, he
might have gone to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Zhang is a UW freshman who, as luck and hard work would have it,
had enough advanced placement and community college course credits
to apply to the computer science major his first year. With nearly
all of the prerequisites under his belt, he was accepted into the
department during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just came to the University of Washington because of their
Computer Science and Engineering Department and how good it was,''
Zhang said. ``I really wouldn't have a second choice at the UW, so
if I hadn't gotten into the computer science department, I would
have considered transferring.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that Zhang would have been rejected. He graduated
from high school in Beaverton, Ore., with a 4.0 GPA, scored a
perfect 1600 on the SAT and had a couple of summers at Intel under
his belt _ all by age 16. Zhang also had offers from MIT, Cal Tech
and the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Lazowska said that, like Zhang, virtually all students admitted
under the new program wouldn't have reason to worry about getting
into the major prior to their junior year. But the early admission
gives a higher degree of certainty.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly all of the application decisions complete, the UW
this year admitted 145 freshmen who declared ``computer science''
or ``computer engineering'' as their intended majors.
</P>
<P>
   Other departments are watching computer science to see how the
early admissions program works. It might be extended to other
engineering departments, Denton said. She cites national data
showing that 40 percent of college students who intend to major in
engineering do not do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just feel isolated,'' Denton said. ``There's a lot of
reasons to believe that bringing them into the loop earlier and
bringing them into the engineering community earlier would be
beneficial from an academic sense.''

`THE MATRIX' KEEPS GRIP ON TOP SPOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``The Matrix'' continued to dazzle moviegoers as
the science-fiction thriller took in an estimated $22.2 million at
2,903 theaters during Friday-Sunday to dominate the nation's
weekend box office, studio sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Warner Bros.' release, highlighted by eye-popping special
effects amid Keanu Reeves leading a rebellion against computers,
showed solid staying power as it lost only 20 percent of its
audience from its opening weekend to push its 12-day total to $72.9
million. ``The Matrix'' is already the third-highest grosser this
year after ``Analyze This'' with $85.9 million and ``Payback'' with
$79.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``These results are the best we could have hoped for,'' said
studio distribution chief Dan Fellman. `` `The Matrix' has become
America's must-see film. We're attracting all ages and a lot of
repeat business.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said ``The Matrix'' has connected well with its core
audience of male teen-agers and young adults. ``It really hit well
with its target customers,'' said movie analyst Arthur Rockwell.
``That's why it has great legs.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source tracking service,
predicted ``The Matrix'' will draw $140 million by the end of its
run and credited the studio with smart scheduling. ``It turned out
better not being released in the summer, when there's so much
competition,'' he noted. ``Young moviegoers will go to a film any
time of the year if it's what they want to see.''
</P>
<P>
   20th Century Fox's romantic comedy ``Never Been Kissed'' opened
respectably in second with $11.7 million at 2,455 theaters.
``Kissed,'' which stars Drew Barrymore as a reporter infiltrating a
high school, performed in line with expectations and could top $50
million by the end of its run, according the Bucksbaum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it will cross over to the date crowd because it's not
just a kids' movie,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Three holdover comedies bunched together for third, fourth and
fifth place, led by Paramount's second weekend of ``The
Out-of-Towners'' with $5.3 million at 2,105 theaters, followed by
Disney's second weekend of ``10 Things I Hate About You'' with $5.2
million at 2,276 sites and Warner's sixth weekend of ``Analyze
This'' with $5.1 million at 2,351 locations. Disney distribution
executive Chuck Viane, noting ``10 Things' '' overall take of $20.5
million places it close to turning a profit, said, ``We're very
happy with it because it was done for the right price.''
</P>
<P>
   Sony's low-cost ensemble comedy ``Go'' generated a moderate
opening in sixth with $4.7 million at 1,563 theaters. Director Doug
Liman's previous effort, 1996's highly praised ``Swingers,'' posted
total grosses of $4.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks' fourth weekend of Sandra Bullock's ``Forces of
Nature'' finished seventh with $3.7 million at 2,335 theaters to go
past $42 million overall. Miramax's opening of ``Twin Dragons,''
the U.S. debut of one of Jackie Chan's Hong Kong action-adventures,
showed little punch in eighth with $2.7 million at 1,129 sites.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the top 10 were Disney's third weekend of ``Doug's
1st Movie'' with $2.3 million at 2,152 locations and Miramax's 18th
weekend of ``Shakespeare in Love'' with $2.2 million at 1,614
theaters. ``Shakespeare,'' with seven Academy Awards, has totaled
$87.5 million since its December release.
</P>
<P>
   Universal's third weekend of ``EDtv,'' starring Matthew
McConaughey, faded to 11th with $2.1 million at 2,494 theaters, a
steep 52 percent decline from the previous weekend as audiences
continued to ignore strong critical support for the comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows star power is so important at the box office to
distinguish a movie from all the competition,'' Bucksbaum noted.
</P>
<P>
   Artisan's limited opening of ensemble comedy ``Foolish,'' with
Master P and Eddie Griffin cast as brothers, posted impressive
results with $2.2 million at 305 sites.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks' ``Prince of Egypt'' hit the $100 million milestone
over the weekend with $362,000 at 644 theaters, becoming the 182nd
movie to top that mark. A record-setting total of 16 films released
in 1998 grossed more than $100 million, led by DreamWorks' ``Saving
Private Ryan'' with $214 million.
</P>
<P>
   Overall grosses hit about $81 million, down about 6 percent from
the same weekend a year ago. Year-to-date grosses have hit $1.5
billion and trail 1998's by about 8 percent due mostly to the
blockbuster numbers generated last year by ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   The weekend started with the AMC chain raising top prices at
several top-grossing megaplexes to $8.50.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell said the move may backfire despite the expected surge
in business next month for ``Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom
Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They may have hit a point where demand could start to fall
off,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Matrix'' will receive a challenge next weekend from
Universal's opening of Eddie Murphy's prison comedy ``Life.'' Also
opening will be Warner's thriller ``Goodbye Lover'' with Patrica
Arquette.

SNAKE, CEDAR RIVERS INCLUDED ON GROUP'S ENDANGERED LISTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HEATH FOSTER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Two majestic _ and politically embroiled _ Washington
rivers are among the 10 most-endangered in the nation, a national
environmental group says.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to force the removal of four dams on the lower
Snake River that have decimated salmon and steelhead runs, American
Rivers on Monday will name the Eastern Washington tributary as the
No. 1 river facing ``severe environmental degradation.''
</P>
<P>
   And in an unexpected attempt to influence the city of Seattle's
final deliberations over how much of the Cedar River's water should
be set aside for struggling fish, the group added that King County
river to its high-profile endangered list for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   American Rivers' annual list is a reflection of the strategic
priorities of the environmental group rather than a true measure of
pollution in the nation's rivers.
</P>
<P>
   The Cedar River supports the largest sockeye run in the
continental United States and is one of the six municipal water
supplies in the nation so clean it requires no filtering, said
George Schneider, the water resource manager for the Seattle Public
Utilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not rivers that are cesspools,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the list puts public pressure on government
agencies that must weigh the needs of the environment against those
of people.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Snake River, federal agencies will decide
soon whether to side with an emerging scientific consensus that
breaching the Snake dams offers the best chance of bringing back
endangered fish runs. Their views have caused panic among
dam-dependent Eastern Washington farmers, and U.S. Sen. Slade
Gorton, R-Wash., has made opposition to breaching a central issue
in his re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to list the Cedar is a surprise attack on Seattle
Mayor Paul Schell's proposed management and habitat conservation
plan for the river's pristine, 90,546-acre watershed.
</P>
<P>
   The forested valley reaching high in the Cascade Range is all
city-owned, and the city provides water to 1.3 million people in
Seattle and 28 suburbs _ nearly one in four Washington residents.
About two-thirds of that water comes from the Cedar.
</P>
<P>
   The habitat conservation plan the city hopes to sign with the
federal government will allow the city to continue to take water at
its 99-year- old dam while protecting endangered species such as
Puget Sound chinook salmon. If approved, it would shield the
watershed's operation from regulations stemming from the Endangered
Species Act. The city's final proposal is due in May.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmental elements of the plan have been widely
applauded. They include a proposal to end logging in the watershed,
to restore habitat and to create a fish ladder allowing salmon to
spawn above Landsburg Dam for the first time since 1909.
</P>
<P>
   But because the agreement will last 50 years, environmentalists,
King County, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Muckelshoot
Tribe are fighting to ensure it also offers fish the water they'll
need to rebound.
</P>
<P>
   They are calling for a moratorium on further withdrawals from
the Cedar pending studies on how much water chinook salmon need.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Ransel, of American Rivers' Northwest office, said the
current plan allows the city to more than double water withdrawals
for the expanding suburbs without providing for fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``This plan allows for unbridled growth,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Holly Coccoli, a fish biologist for the Muckleshoot Indian tribe
who has studied the Cedar for nearly a decade, said the river can't
serve many more people and stay healthy for fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city of Seattle is already serving about a million people
from the Cedar River, and that is a lot of people for such a small,
short river,'' she said. ``Maybe it's time for us to say we have
altered this river enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Fueling the controversy is the fact that it's hard to pin city
officials down on exactly what their intentions are for the river's
excess water.
</P>
<P>
   The Cedar produces about 550 million gallons of water a day.
Seattle Public Utilities says that an 1888 claim allows the city to
use 300 million gallons, but in the past 40 years it has taken only
about a third as much as it could. Because of conservation
measures, withdrawals from the Cedar have not increased over the
past decade.
</P>
<P>
   In its draft plan, the city proposes leaving a minimum of 45
percent of the river's natural flow, or 250 million gallons per
day, in the river for fish. City biologists say that is ample for
fish recovery, and is well above the guaranteed flow the state
Department of Ecology set in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves about 183 million unallocated gallons per day for
city use.
</P>
<P>
   Schell aide Lisa Fitzhugh said it would be foolish for the city
to agree now to never use any of that water. Until the region
develops alternate water supplies, the city has a responsibility to
help growing communities that face water shortages, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feds agree this (habitat conservation plan) is a great,
scientifically-based, supportable plan for fish,'' she said. ``And
Seattle wants to keep its flexibility to supply water for people
because future supplies haven't come on line yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle is expected to grow by about 114,000 people to a
population of 650,000 in 2020, and King County will grow by 26
percent, from 1.65 million residents in 1997 to 2.1 million in
2020.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider, the city water resource manager, said if Seattle
agrees to a water cap, it would close off such options.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't intend to support the future growth of the region on
the back of Cedar River, but we want to have the advantage of using
unallocated water where it makes sense for people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups say that before the city embarks on such a
plan, it should require suburbs to conserve more.
</P>
<P>
   But Fitzhugh said the city can't refuse water to the suburbs if
they don't conserve. Such preaching could cause the suburban cities
to refuse to partner with the city on other problems, such as
housing the homeless, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups insist the city should study what the
chinook salmon need before they agree to shifting Cedar River water
to other rivers, or sign the conservation plan.

CELTICS HOLD ON FOR VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Five days ago they had a meeting. They were not there
to talk about a crisis. It was a meeting to talk about winning.
Antoine Walker remembers the key moment in that Celtics session.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, we had 17 games remaining in the season,'' Walker
said Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, ``and I think it was (associate head coach) Jim
O'Brien who said, `Let's go 12-5.' Since that time, we're 3-1.''
</P>
<P>
   Win No. 3 since The Meeting came Sunday &UR;  &LR; night at the
FleetCenter, 87-81, against the Bulls. O'Brien didn't mention
anything about artistry when he made his 12-5 statement. He just
wanted the players to ease up a little on the Lottery accelerator,
because they seemed to be flooring it toward the inevitable May
trip to Secaucus, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The 17,169 people in the arena can tell you that Sunday &UR;  &LR; night's
win wasn't memorable, but it was obviously better than the
alternative. In their shortened season, the 13-23 Celtics haven't
had many good things happen to them, so it was appropriate that the
shot that secured the game for them was, well, a little awkward.
</P>
<P>
   Vitaly Potapenko, a 285-pound center not known for his
long-range jump shot, was standing 21 feet from the basket with the
shot clock heading toward zero. The Celtics held an 83-80 lead, and
the game clock was moving toward 14 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard the guys yelling, `Shoot it,' '' Potapenko said. So
the center, who finished with 8 points, fired a desperation fling
at the hoop. It went in. It was 85-80 and, unofficially, the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about that?'' said Walker, who had 23 points and 11
rebounds. ``We need to have some luck around here. It's about time
we got some luck, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Potapenko joked that the play was designed for him because ``the
coaches know I'm such a good jump-shooter.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Celtics were able to laugh about the game when it was
over, they didn't have much room for fun when it was unfolding (and
unfolding very slowly). The biggest contradiction came in the first
half. The Celtics made 52 percent of their shots, the Bulls made
only 34, so the score was . . . tied at 37?
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason for that is that we turned the ball over so much
early,'' said Walter McCarty, referring to Chicago's 13-3 turnover
advantage in the first 24 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting 52 percent and not having a lead to show for it is
uncommon in the NBA. That statistical quirk, as well as the score,
made Bulls coach Tim Floyd happy. After the game, the first-year
coach said something that should make score-happy fans cringe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like it was going to have to be a game in the low 70s
or high 60s for us to have a shot,'' he said. ``We don't have a lot
of weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   The two weapons they had were Toni Kukoc (23 points) and Ron
Harper (19). Take away their contributions and you have 7-of-30
shooting from Chicago starters. Still, that was enough to keep the
Bulls within 7 points the entire night. They trailed, 66-61,
entering the fourth quarter. They were able to close the deficit to
76-75 on a Harper 3-pointer with 6:43 left. But two minutes later,
Walker answered with a 3-pointer of his own.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the Celtics couldn't increase their lead to more
than 4 until Potapenko's shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good win for us,'' Celtics coach Rick Pitino said.
Before saying that, Pitino surprised many people when he began his
postgame press conference with a barrage of coachspeak. He was not
happy with his team's post defense or containment. ``We shot well,
ran the offense well, and played good defense _ with the exception
of ball containment.''
</P>
<P>
   The team got plenty of work from its backcourt. Ron Mercer and
Dana Barros played 45 and 44 minutes. Mercer added 18 points and 6
rebounds; Barros had 10 points, 12 assists, and 2 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Although Walker would say later that a win over the 10-27 Bulls
didn't ``tickle my fancy,'' it still allowed him to have a better
performance against the team from his hometown. The last time he
saw them, Harper was giving him the choke sign and fans were booing
his 2-of-15 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Neither happened Sunday &UR;  &LR; night. Harper was blowing verbal kisses
afterward and most fans left happy. And O'Brien left the building
knowing that the team is a win closer to reaching the number he
challenged it to get five days ago.

BOX SCORE CONSTRUCTED BRICK BY BRICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Ron Harper was sure of one thing Sunday &UR;  &LR; night. He's
going to be hearing from his buddy, Michael Jordan, sometime real
soon. He's also sure that he's going to be getting the call, not
making it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't calling him,'' Harper said. ``You know, one of his
famous quotes was that he could probably do it all himself. Well I
can hear him say that: `Forty-nine points? I could get that
myself.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan did get 49 points all by himself quite a bit. He scored
49 or more points 50 times in his career. There were many nights
when his supporting cast would score 49 points and no one noticed.
This time, the world dropped its collective jaw because the
supporting cast is now the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls played the Celtics Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, a mere 24 hours
removed from one of the most mortifying performances in NBA
history. They lost, at home, to Miami by the still unthinkable
score of 82-49. It was the fewest points scored since the
introduction of the shot clock 44 years ago. Upon seeing the
result, Princeton called to see if the Bulls wanted its game tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's output increased dramatically against the Celtics _
how could it not? _ but the Bulls still lost, 87-81, their 27th
loss in 37 games. They're on a pace to lose more games in this
shortened season than the previous two Chicago teams lost in full
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   In an almost diabolical twist, the Bulls' next game is Tuesday
night in Miami. In this year of Chicago payback, no one in the East
will enjoy exacting revenge more than Pat Riley. His Heat twice got
the playoff boot from Michael &AMP; Co. and he can pass Red Auerbach
and move into third place for all-time coaching wins with 939.
(Lenny Wilkens and Bill Fitch are 1-2.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to show them we're not the same team we were
(Saturday),'' said the Bulls' Randy Brown. That shouldn't be too
hard.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting has been the Bulls' undoing all year. They are one of
two teams _ the Nets are the other _ shooting less than 40 percent
(39 percent). Against Miami on Saturday night, in fashioning
quarters of 8, 15, 10, and 16 points, the Bulls shot a spiffy 23
percent. Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, they shot 39 percent, which, in their
world, is the norm.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (Miami) game was definitely in the back of our minds,''
said Brown, who was 2 for 12 from the field. ``We didn't want to
fall behind in a hurry and then have everyone thinking, `Here we go
again.' ''
</P>
<P>
   They actually led after one, were tied at the half, and were
within 3 in the 48th minute. We could suggest that having played
the night before might have taken its toll, but how could that be
an excuse when you score 49 points?
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty-nine points,'' Celtics coach Rick Pitino said in
disbelief. ``We had 67 (on Friday) and I couldn't fathom that. . .
. That's unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls passed 49 on a Cory Carr jumper with 6:36 left in the
third quarter. Chicago felt the game had to be in the ``low 70s or
high 60s'' for it to have a chance. Honest. That's what Tim Floyd,
the Bulls' coach, said afterwards. He was serious. He was talking
about his offense, not what Greg Norman needed Sunday to win.
</P>
<P>
   If the Bulls were concerned about going into the NBA Record Book
in such a wretched manner, they didn't show it before or after.
Toni Kukoc was watching the Masters with rapt attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stuff happens,'' Bill Wennington said, although he didn't say
the word ``stuff.'' ``Sometimes you step over it. Sometimes you
step in it.'' He said he hadn't bothered to read any stories of the
game. ``I did a lot better at not reading the papers than I did in
shooting the basketball,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harper addressed how horrible the play has been this season. The
reasons are many: overzealous coaches, poor shooters, clueless
players, diluted talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ugly basketball being played out there,'' he said. ``Some
days, you turn on the TV and you see some ugly games. But I'm not
embarrassed. We played hard. We just didn't make any shots.''
</P>
<P>
   That was Floyd's take as well. He liked the effort. He just
didn't like the shot selection. And typical of the coaching mindset
these days, he said the 49-point game was not nearly as
disconcerting as the game 10 days earlier against Orlando when the
Bulls _ are you sitting down? _ allowed 115 points.
</P>
<P>
   The coach liked what he saw Sunday &UR;  &LR; night a lot more than the
night before. But it was another loss. Harper's still going to have
some explaining to do when M.J. rings him up. No one has to remind
Harper of what he doesn't have anymore, least of all the one who
made it thus.

BURNS WON'T LET BRUINS REST ON LAURELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Bruins were breathing a collective sigh of relief
Sunday while enjoying a much needed day of rest. The club just
finished playing six games in 10 days to start the month and earned
10 of a possible 12 points, securing a playoff spot in the midst of
that run.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it will have a few days to nurse a variety of injuries
before ending the season with three games in four days against
contending clubs _ Pittsburgh, Buffalo, and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL standings continue to run through the Mixmaster on a
daily basis, and Boston could finish anywhere from fifth place in
the Eastern Conference to eighth. Coach Pat Burns continues to
stress that he doesn't care who the team's first-round opponent is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care where we finish, it doesn't bother me,'' Burns
said. ``What bothers me is how we're going to play going into the
playoffs. I don't care where we finish, I just want to make sure
we're on our game when we go in. If you start picking your spots
and who you want to play, you're in deep trouble. Let's just go in
there and be playing well, because you're going to have to play the
good teams anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns said he doesn't want his players to gain any false sense
of security. If the teams sit out stars in an effort to give them
some rest before the postseason, which Burns has talked about
doing, he doesn't want his players to get the wrong idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played a lot of games in a lot of nights in the last run
and now we have three days to prepare for those games that are
coming up,'' he said. ``These are teams that are probably a little
bit better. I just hope they don't decide to rest players, too, and
the games become something of a psychological thing where if we do
beat a team easily, we think that's how it's going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Not much has been easy for the Bruins this year. They started
out by missing players because of holdouts and then had to scramble
the lineup because of injuries to key personnel that kept players
out for long periods. Back in late January and into early February,
the Bruins had the potential to sink like a stone. The bottoming
out came in a 5-4 loss to the Islanders at home Feb. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the team has racked up a 17-8-5 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made up some big ground,'' said center Tim Taylor, who was
outspoken about his club's woes during that rough stretch when the
Rangers and Florida had the Bruins' postseason hopes in peril.
``Obviously, we're very positive with the way things are going now.
We're ready. We're keen to play, we're excited to play. At that
time, I just think collectively we weren't playing well together
and not as a team. Some individuals were playing well, some
weren't. On any given night, some guys were going well and some
guys weren't. We'd make one or two mistakes and the puck would be
in our net.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns has his players back to executing the system that was
largely responsible for the remarkable improvement of last year,
which was 30 points better than the season before. Taylor said the
fact they now are embracing that again has accounted for how
they're playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've turned that around and gotten back to our system of last
year,'' he said. ``Everyone plays the same and performs the same
function out there and we know what's going on and we're playing as
a team. We all know the better the team does, the better everyone
else is going to do and not just for this year, for years to
come.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were grateful to get rid of Tampa Bay, which they
played twice in a three-day span. Both contests were stinkers,
although Boston won one. But everyone agreed this mini-break could
not have come at a more perfect time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel it's good for us; we've gone through a big stretch,''
said Taylor. ``It's always nice to have a break when you win a game
and (we've) only lost two in our last 13. We'd be kind of tired and
disgusted with ourselves if it had gone the other way and we had
two wins in our last 13 games. It is a good time for us. A lot of
guys have bumps and bruises. Through this dogfight of eight months,
it's really catching up to us. Now, we'll get this little break to
refresh ourselves for this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Tallas played in goal the last two games, giving Byron Dafoe
a break. It's likely Dafoe will play all three of the remaining
contests to tune up for the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said the Bruins all will benefit from the extra few days
before they finish up the stretch that begins Thursday night at
home against the Penguins. An afternoon game against the Sabres
follows on Saturday, and they close the regular season with the
Flyers in Philadelphia.

BELCHER HIT HARD AGAIN IN LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Angels pitcher Tim Belcher took one look at
teammate Omar Olivares and proclaimed: ``It's your fault!'' for the
beating the Texas Rangers laid on Belcher and the Angels on Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher, who was only half-kidding, got hammered for five runs
and 11 hits in three-plus innings in the Rangers' 6-3 victory
before 23,175 at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   It came only one night after Olivares threw 71/3 scoreless
innings against the same big-hitting Rangers lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Omar had them so frustrated so much last night,'' Belcher
(0-1) said. ``Then they get somebody with not quite the same
movement on the ball, they're going to come out hacking, and that's
what they did.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers certainly came out swinging in the first inning,
when Tom Goodwin and Mark McLemore opened with back-to-back
triples. By the time the inning was finished, the Rangers had five
hits and a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   With the way Rangers starter Aaron Sele is throwing, the Angels
were in for a long night. Sele gave up three runs in 52/3 innings,
but only one run was earned, coming on Troy Glaus' second homer of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Sele (2-0), who threw seven scoreless innings against the Tigers
in his first start, struck out 10 and lowered his ERA to 0.71. But
it should not come as a surprise. In seven career April starts as a
Ranger, Sele is 7-0. Overall in his career, Sele is 15-3 in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the best I've seen him throw,'' said Angels right
fielder Tim Salmon, who went 0 for 4. ``When he's got a curveball
like that and he's throwing it for strikes, he's tough. It's got
such a big break it goes out of your normal line of sight. And he
throws it enough, you've got to respect it, making his fastball
that much better.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you can throw the curveball any better than he
did tonight,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said. ``He threw it in
the strike zone, out of the strike zone and had a quality fastball
and slider.''
</P>
<P>
   As good as Sele has been in his first two starts, Belcher has
been bad. Belcher gave up five runs in 41/3 innings against the
Indians on opening night. And with his performance Sunday, his ERA
actually went up from 10.38 to 12.27. Belcher, though, shrugged it
off. He said control has been his biggest problem, but it's not
something he can't work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I got my (rear) kicked,'' he said. ``It's happened
before and I'm sure it'll happen again. They were far better
hitters than I was a pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason to be concerned other than having a bruised
ego. It's not fun. The middle of the diamond is a lonely place when
hits are flying all over the place. But if I've learned one thing
in my career, sometimes you push the panic button too quickly and
start changing things. If I've learned one thing, it is not to do
that. Two bad outings is not going to change that.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't exactly the type of performance the Angels wanted to
have, especially considering it was a nationally televised game and
against the defending AL West champions. Angels left fielder
Orlando Palmeiro had an embarrassing moment, dropping a routine pop
fly to shallow left hit by Ivan Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those nights,'' Angels manager Terry Collins
said. ``It wasn't a very pretty game.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with Glaus (2 for 4) the only other bright spot for the
Angels was the performance of reliever Al Levine. Levine, released
by the Rangers at the end of spring training, gave up only one
unearned run in four innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas bullpen, though, was just as good. Tim Crabtree threw
21/3 scoreless innings and John Wetteland threw a scoreless ninth
for his second save.

MARINER ROMP HELPS NEW SHORTSTOP FIND COMFORT ZONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ For Giomar Guevara, redemption came quickly Sunday and
in the typical Mariner fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Guevara is the fifth Mariner to spin through the shortstop
turnstile in the season's first six games. He was promoted from
Class AAA Tacoma Sunday to replace Carlos Guillen, who will miss
the rest of the season after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament
in his right knee Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On the second play of the first inning, Guevara charged a ground
ball and threw wildly for an error. On the second play of the
second inning, he did the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the third inning, he forgot about his defensive
troubles the way the Mariners usually do _ by helping out the
high-powered offense. Guevara hit a run-scoring double, part of an
eight-run third that sent Seattle to an 11-8 win over the Oakland
Athletics at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Guevara's hit was the sixth of seven in a row for the Mariners,
tying a 17-year-old club record. But any joy a victory brought was
tempered by the sting of losing Guillen, who went down just days
after shortstop Alex Rodriguez's knee injury, which will keep him
from the lineup 4-6 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard people say things happen in threes,'' said Mariners
starter Jamie Moyer, who allowed five runs in 62/3 innings but
earned his first win of the year. ``Geez, not to be the bearer of
bad news, but I seriously hope that third thing doesn't happen to
anybody on this ballclub. It's very unfortunate, but you deal with
it and move forward with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners will move forward with Guevara and newly signed
veteran Domingo Cedeno at shortstop, and David Bell remaining at
second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure everybody in this clubhouse feels bad for Alex and
especially for Carlos, but when the game starts you've got to go
out and try to win,'' Bell said. ``And you've got to feel like
we're good enough to win. If you don't, you're going to be in
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Home runs from Edgar Martinez, Russ Davis and John Mabry, and
hits from everybody in the lineup by the third inning, showed the
Mariners offense should survive. Pitching and defense? Going off
Sunday, there is work to be done.
</P>
<P>
   Guevara said he dropped his elbow on the wild throws, and while
the 26-year-old is considered a strong defensive player with a good
arm, the angles of his throws could give him problems.
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen should get a boost in about a week, when veteran
Mark Leiter is expected to be ready to come off the disabled list.
Leiter played catch Sunday and felt no pain, and manager Lou
Piniella is looking forward to having him back to share set-up
duties with Jose Paniagua.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the Mariner bullpen has allowed 14 earned runs in
182/3 innings for a 6.75 earned run average.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer left Sunday's outing with a runner on second, two outs and
a 10-4 lead. Brett Hinchliffe walked John Jaha and allowed a
run-scoring single to Eric Chavez before getting out of the inning
on a slick play by first baseman David Segui.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, Hinchliffe left with a run in and a man on
second, and Paniagua allowed a run-scoring single and ground out
before escaping. Consecutive doubles greeted John Halama in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella's other ninth-inning option, Jose Mesa, surrendered
four runs in one inning on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't walk people in late-inning situations, and you can't
fall behind hitters consistently,'' Piniella said. ``You've got the
lead, make the other team beat you with the bat. You start walking
people and the ump starts squeezing you, you're pitching behind in
the count and you've got to lay the ball in there.''
</P>
<P>
   SUZUKI MEETING: Piniella met with reliever Mac Suzuki, who was
cited for drunk driving after a hit-and-run accident early Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something he should learn from,'' Piniella said. ``It's
part of the maturing process of a young man. ... It's something
that shouldn't happen, but it can happen to anybody. Nobody got
hurt. It's an experience that shouldn't repeat itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki, who was visited in the clubhouse Sunday morning by an
official from major league baseball, would not discuss the
incident. He pleaded not guilty in King County District Court
Saturday and was released on $1,500 bail.

OLAZABAL SAVORS UPHILL WALK TO SECOND MASTERS TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ It might not have been a compelling conclusion to
a golf tournament that is supposed to yield dramatic shots in
majestic surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   For Jose Maria Olazabal, the Masters was special nonetheless.
The 33-year-old Spaniard won his second green jacket, fending off
the charges of Davis Love III and Greg Norman Sunday at Augusta
National.
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal shot a 1-under-par 71 to finish at 8-under. Love also
had a 71 and was two strokes behind. Norman, the sentimental
favorite, led briefly after an eagle at the 13th hole but finished
third at 5-under.
</P>
<P>
   Between September 1995 and February '96, Olazabal did not play
golf. He could barely walk, suffering from a lower back hernia.
</P>
<P>
   For the longest time, he just wanted to walk again. Golf was not
a priority then. So this leap from his couch in Spain to victory
stand at Augusta was a moving development that caught up to
Olazabal afterward.
</P>
<P>
   He could barely keep from crying as he walked up the 18th
fairway, acknowledging the applause with Norman. Then the tears
came in the media room when someone asked him what he will do as
soon as he gets home.
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal paused, held his head in his hands before finally
replying: ``I will embrace my family, for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Patience and perseverance paid off for Olazabal when he couldn't
walk, and they served him during Sunday's round as well.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived at the course, Olazabal was nervous. He couldn't
eat or drink.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't swallow, not even water,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As he waited for his 3 p.m. tee time, Olazabal realized that if
he was going to win, it would be in a breeze _ many of them,
gusting every which way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult on this golf course to judge the intensity
of the wind, the direction of the wind, what the ball's going to do
when it gets up in the air,'' he said. ``I knew the scoring was not
going to be low. If anybody was scoring really low, he must play,
you know, like angels.''
</P>
<P>
   Heaven-sent, Olazabal was not. He appeared down and out on the
front side, bogeying Nos. 3-5.
</P>
<P>
   At the par-3 4th, he was fortunate to escape with a four, taking
two blasts to emerge from a trap. After his bogey at 5, Olazabal
had slipped to 4-under, bringing a crowd back into the hunt. He
righted himself at the par-3 6th, hitting a 6-iron within nine feet
and sinking the birdie putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``That got me going again,'' Olazabal said.
</P>
<P>
   On the back side, the gallery was goading Norman but courteously
supporting Olazabal. At 13, Olazabal doused a seemingly pivotal
hole for Norman, retaining the momentum as well as a share of the
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Norman hit a 200-yard 4-iron approach, leaving himself a
25-footer for eagle. Olazabal laid up and faced a 25-foot birdie
butt. Norman got his eagle, but Olazabal followed it in, and the
two leaders headed to the 14th tee at 7-under-par.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as he hit it, it looked to me like it was going in all
the way,'' Olazabal said. ``And while that ball was rolling, I was
saying to myself, just try to make yours because I didn't want to
go one stroke behind. Making that putt was an important boost.'
</P>
<P>
   Norman relinquished his share of the lead with bogeys at 14 and
15. The bogey at 15 was particularly curious given the
circumstances. Norman faced a 94-yard shot to the hole with plenty
of green to work with and slapped it into a bunker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some mud on my ball,'' Norman said. ``I just tried to
squeeze the sand wedge out. And when I squeezed it out there, the
ball just carried a little right.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman blasted out but missed his par putt, the ball lipping the
cup and making a right turn. The green was completely in the
shadows, and Olazabal was about to leave Norman in the dark and in
the dust.
</P>
<P>
   That left Olazabal with a two-shot lead over Norman and one-shot
lead over Love, who had just chipped in for birdie at the 16th to
move to 6-under.
</P>
<P>
   As he stood on the 16th tee, Olazabal took an excessive amount
of time sizing up the situation, studying the wind, wondering what
to hit. He finally chose a 6-iron to execute a 170-yard shot. It
landed 3 feet from the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a wonderful shot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So was the next stroke, a delicate one that amazed Olazabal as
he performed in a crowded theater so quiet you could hear a putt
drop.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't imagine what a 3-footer that was,'' he said. ``Down
the hill, lightning quick, left to right. I don't know how the hell
I made that putt.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman tried to respond, hitting his approach within five feet,
but he missed his birdie putt, blood seeping from the Shark at
Augusta again.
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal wrapped it up with a par-saving 7-foot putt on the
hardpan 17th green, keeping his two-stroke lead over Love with one
hole to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I die for a 4 on that hole,'' said Olazabal, who did not have
a three-putt during the entire tournament. ``And when I got that 4,
I knew the jacket should be mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Routinely, Olazabal got his par on the 18th, appropriately
ending the tournament with an uphill battle on a hole that rises
toward the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult for me to express how I feel at this
particular moment, especially after what I went through,'' Olazabal
said. ``I'm very proud of myself. I'm a really happy man. It's an
achievement that I didn't even dream about when I was low.''

BOYS RANCH TRIAL DECISION AT HAND: 5 EX-WORKERS FIGHT MURDER
COUNT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DENNIS WAGNER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Five former employees of Arizona Boys Ranch face a
crucial hurdle this week in their battle against charges that they
killed a 16-year-old client at the home for delinquents in March
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants will appear Tuesday in Pinal County Superior
Court for a preliminary hearing, where Judge Richard Fields is
expected to decide whether there is probable cause for a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Although most preliminary hearings are perfunctory events,
defense lawyers said they intend to use the forum as a three-day
minitrial in this case. And it will be preceded with a hot dispute
over motions seeking to dismiss the charges entirely.
</P>
<P>
   The five defendants _ Linda Babb, Geoffrey S. Lewis, Montgomery
Hoover, Michael M. Moreno and Troy M. Jones _ face counts of
first-degree murder and child abuse in the case of Nicholas
Contreraz, a Sacramento youth who died of lung infections after
days of punishment and taunting at a boot camp in Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys reacted angrily last month when the Pinal
County Attorney's Office replaced a manslaughter indictment with
the first-degree murder counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to Mr. Contreraz is a tragedy,'' said Ed Novak,
co-counsel for Hoover. ``Everyone regrets his death. But no one is
at fault with respect to his death.''
</P>
<P>
   After an initial indictment was withdrawn, Pinal County
prosecutor Janna Vanderpool filed new charges last month. Defense
lawyers were stunned when she elevated the case to first-degree
murder and added a provision for ``dangerous crimes against
children'' _ an aggravating circumstance that would drastically
magnify penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just off the wall,'' said Stephen M. Weiss, counsel to
Babb, a Boys Ranch nurse who reportedly labeled Contreraz a
malingerer and failed to detect his illness after a bout of
vomiting and diarrhea. ``They (prosecutors) are just trying to
squeeze us.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanderpool declined interview requests. Charles Ratliff, a
spokesman at her office, said: ``We're going to let the preliminary
hearing speak for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, defense lawyers have filed a rash of motions seeking
dismissal of the charges. Among their claims:
</P>
<P>
   _The case should be thrown out because prosecutors have not
identified specific acts as a basis for the criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   _The first-degree murder complaint was motivated by
prosecutorial vindictiveness. Defense attorneys claim that
Vanderpool ``upped the ante'' in retaliation for their successful
move to squelch the manslaughter indictment because of grand jury
bias.
</P>
<P>
   _The ``dangerous crimes against children'' allegations should be
dropped because Arizona statutes say that is valid only when the
victim is younger than 15; Contreraz was 16.
</P>
<P>
   _The whole case should be dismissed because Vanderpool filed the
criminal complaint with Pinal County Superior Court Judge Gilbert
Figueroa, who had been recused. Defense lawyers used legal
``strikes'' to recuse four Pinal County judges available for the
case. As a result, it was transferred to Fields, a Pima County
Superior Court judge.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary hearings, which allow hearsay evidence, are held to
determine whether there is probable cause to bind defendants over
for trial. Most such proceedings are perfunctory _ uncontested by
defense attorneys who save their arguments and strategy for trial.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Vanderpool is expected to use testimony from a
criminal investigator, a coroner and a medical expert to establish
probable cause. Defense attorneys, in turn, plan to grill those
witnesses in an effort to show that their clients were not
responsible for Contreraz's death, and did not abuse the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one is far from perfunctory,'' said Mike Piccarreta, an
attorney for Jones. ``I'm sure we're prepared to do anything to
pull the plug on the prosecution.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers condemned the prosecution for filing
first-degree murder counts. They also blasted Vanderpool for
listing the child abuse allegations as dangerous crimes against
children _ an aggravating factor that, if upheld, would result in
mandatory prison sentences of 17 years or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theoretically, the death penalty is available,'' Piccarreta
said. ``This is hardball.''
</P>
<P>
   The death of Contreraz set off a chain reaction of woes not only
for the youth's family, but for Boys Ranch and its employees.
</P>
<P>
   California, which supplied most of the youth placements,
withdrew all of its boys and issued a scathing report on
mistreatment of juveniles. The Arizona Department of Economic
Security conducted an exhaustive investigation documenting abuse or
neglect on the part of 17 ranch employees.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a DES threat to withhold an operating permit, Boys Ranch
agreed to a settlement with the state that calls for a major
overhaul of programs, policies and operations.
</P>
<P>
   The ranch, known for its tough, hands-on rehabilitation methods,
closed all but one of six campuses. Most employees were laid off.
Bob Thomas, longtime president, was replaced.
</P>
<P>
   The client population has dropped to 40 from 600, leaving Boys
Ranch with virtually no revenue. The non-profit organization,
nearly a half-century old, is struggling to survive and rebuild. &QL;

DUCKS SHUT OUT COYOTES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- If Sunday evening's game was any indication, the
Phoenix Coyotes and Mighty Ducks are fully prepared to rumble if
the two teams meet in the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks took a big step towards making that a reality with a
3-0 before 17,174 at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   It was game filled with playoff-type intensity, one that ended
on a wild note thanks to Phoenix's volatile captain Keith Tkachuk.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk threw his stick at Teemu Selanne, who was about to score
his league-leading 46th goal into an empty net in the final minute
of play, bowled the winger over after he had released the shot and
then leveled Kevin Haller. That led to a full-fledged brawl,
highlighted by a fight between Jaime Pushor and Rick Tocchet.
</P>
<P>
   For his efforts, Tkachuk picked 22 minutes in penalties.
</P>
<P>
   But the Ducks, who desperately needed to get back on track after
going 0-3-1 in their previous four games, weren't about to make a
big deal of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just part of the game,'' said Haller. ``Guys get
frustrated when they lose a close game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we win, it doesn't matter what they do to us,''
said Ruslan Salei, who had been a target of the Coyotes all season.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks (35-32-12) improved to 3-1-2 versus Phoenix and moved
back into fifth place, one point ahead of St. Louis. They also
prevented the Coyotes from clinching fourth place in the Western
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   It was all thanks to an emotional, hard-working effort, the type
that has been missing in action since the team clinched a playoff
spot.
</P>
<P>
   The added effort paid big dividends in the Phoenix end of the
ice. In the first period Paul Kariya forced a turnover along the
right wing boards, cut to the right circle and beat Nikolai
Khabibulin with a brilliant wrist shot high over the Phoenix
goalie's glove at 3:21. It was Kariya's 37th goal of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a great play by Paul,'' said Anaheim coach Craig
Hartsburg. ``There aren't many guys who can make that shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Both teams squandered power play chance after power play chance.
Phoenix's 26th ranked power play unit was unsurprising 0-for-6. But
Anaheim's top-ranked unit was 0-for-7 and didn't manage a shot on
goal until its fifth opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   But the Ducks forechecked their way to a two-goal advantage
midway through the third period. Anaheim's unsung duo of Jim
McKenzie and Jeff Nielsen kept the puck alive behind the Phoenix
net and converted that pressure into a 2-0 lead at 11:52.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mac makes a Wayne Gretzky-like pass,'' said Nielsen, who cut
across the slot and beat Khabibulin high on the glove side for his
fifth goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was great team goal,'' said Hartsburg. ``That line (which
also includes Ted Drury) was good all night and it's good to see
them get rewarded.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix outshot Aanheim 40-31, but Guy Hebert managed to record
his club-record sixth shutout of the season. Tkachuk did deflect a
shot by him five minutes into the second period, but both of his
skates were in the crease and the goal was waved off.
</P>
<P>
   Hebert, who along with the rest of the team has numerous shakey
moments recently, said there was no reason not to be ready for a
game with Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have Tocchet laughing at you and (Dallas) Drake
running everybody ... if that doesn't bring out the best in you
it's going to be a long night,'' said Hebert. ``It's a fun game to
play in.''

<P>
   ANAHEIM -- Although it's been documented that the Ducks would
prefer to play Phoenix in the first round rather than Detroit or
Colorado, they were very careful not to give the Coyotes any
bulletin board material after Sunday's victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are all really tough teams,'' said Teemu Selanne,
refering to Phoenix, Detroit and Colorado. ``It doesn't matter who
we play against, we are just worried about playing at our own
level. We want to build confidence in the last three games. It's
tough to turn things around if you don't have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Guy Hebert admitted he'd like to play Phoenix, but went out of
his way to explain it has more to do with the rivalry, then
thinking Phoenix is an easy mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our past history would just make it exciting, said the Anaheim
goalie.
</P>
<P>
   --
</P>
<P>
   Ducks center Steve Rucchin did not play for the ninth time in
the last 10 games due to a groin injury he suffered in practice on
March 20.
</P>
<P>
   Rucchin was having the best season of his career before getting
hurt -- 23 goals and 61 points in 66 games -- and he's clearly
frustrated by the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I lay in bed and want to scream,'' said Rucchin, who
suffered a setback when he attempted to play against New Jersey on
March 31. ``This is an especially fun time for this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Teemu Selanne, who tried to rush back from a thigh injury
earlier this season, cautions that Rucchin must take his time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such important player, he can't rush, he's got to be 100
percent for the playoffs,'' said Selanne.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks have especially missed Rucchin's defensive skills and
his prowess in the face-off circle.
</P>
<P>
   --
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim was also without defenseman Pascal Trepanier who is out
for the season after suffering a torn ACL while playing basketball
on an off day last week.
</P>
<P>
   --
</P>
<P>
   Winger Tomas Sandstrom left the game due to dizziness in the
first period and did not return. Sandstrom was knocked head-first
into the Phoenix bench by Bob Corkum. Antti Aalto moved up from the
checking line to replace Sandstrom.
</P>
<P>
   --
</P>
<P>
   Paul Kariya had three shots in the game to increase his season
total to 414, tying him with Bobby Hull for the third most in NHL
single-season history. After Kariya passes Hull, he will take aim
at the 426 shots Phil Esposito recorded in 1971-72.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya has no chance of beating Esposito's all-time record of
550 set in '70-71.
</P>
<P>
   Coming into Sunday's game Jaromir Jagr was second to Kariya with
327.

REVOLUTION SHOW SIGNS OF SELF-CONFIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ A few months ago, the Revolution were on the
verge of becoming a collective basket case. The team lacked
confidence, and there was an overall depressed feeling, often
masked by unrealistic optimism, which was manifested in
record-setting defeats.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Revolution appear to have regained some self-belief.
They have avoided the collapses that plagued them last year, in
defeats of 5-1 to Los Angeles (twice) and 6-1 to Columbus. And,
after surrendering last-minute goals, they have regained their
composure.
</P>
<P>
   When the Revolution fell behind to D.C. United in the final
seconds of the first half of their home opener Saturday night, they
recovered quickly before 18,373 at Foxboro Stadium. After appearing
vulnerable, saved only by the extraordinary goalkeeping of
player-coach Walter Zenga, they rallied in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a 2-2 tie after regulation time. And though the
Revolution lost in the shootout to remain with 3 points in three
matches, this is the first time in four seasons they have outscored
the opposition at this point in the season. This is also the first
time they have avoided defeat in regulation time in the first three
matches.
</P>
<P>
   Although Major League Soccer fails to reward tie games, even a
shootout failure cannot overcome the soccer axiom that the weaker
team feels a sense of accomplishment by preventing the opposition
from winning. And, the Revolution's 4-3 goal differential is
encouraging, since only four MLS teams outscored the opposition
last season.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses remain, but the Revolution are receiving optimal
contributions from Ivan McKinley and Johnny Torres, who were
ineffective last season. Dan Calichman and Richard Goulooze have
been effective in central defense. Zenga's goalkeeping has been
spectacular. And Giuseppe ``Beppe'' Galderisi added inspiration in
his debut as assistant coach, though his hiring has not been
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows their role on the team, and that is something
we lacked in recent years,'' said defender Ted Chronopoulos, who
made his team-leading 87th appearance Saturday. ``We have more
leadership in the locker room from Dan, plus Walter and Beppe. The
young guys might have been thinking, here we go again, after we
fell behind. But those guys were saying, `We can do this.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We might have put our heads down last year. But we showed a
lot of composure. We showed we are not quitters.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution are hardly a complete team, with key players
recovering from injuries. And their lack of midfield play has
placed even more pressure on the defense. But Edwin Gorter and Jair
provided creativity against United, and Joe-Max Moore converted an
exceptional free kick to compensate for an otherwise ineffective
performance.
</P>
<P>
   This is a crucial stretch for the Revolution. They meet Columbus
Saturday and visit D.C. United April 24. By then, the team's
identity could be established and the tone for the season
confirmed. This is still a fragile situation, and the Revolution
are not yet playing from a position of strength. They consider it
an accomplishment to draw at home against D.C. United, which tells
much about the relative strengths of the teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution were outplayed for much of the contest, but
trailed for a total of only 16 minutes, the first time they have
fallen behind this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we were behind a lot, and that puts pressure on
you,'' Chronopoulos said. ``We were erratic in the first half
(against United), giving up a lot of simple passes. We were leaving
too many gaps in the second half. But, we are playing with a lot
more confidence.''

WETLANDS NEAR SEWAGE-TREATMENT PLANT CLEAN WASTEWATER, SHELTER
WILDLIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS FISCUS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ There's a place in the far southwest Phoenix area
where you can see a great blue heron &UR; picking its way along the
waterline, or an egret gliding overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Beavers cross one trail. Turtles and a melodious marsh wren find
homes near another.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came here at sunset and it was like a scene from `National
Geographic,' '' one visitor, Lynn Timmons, said after a look.
``It's the desert. You don't expect to see this kind of scenery.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially when it's next to a sewage treatment plant and
drawing its water from the plant's discharge.
</P>
<P>
   The site is Tres Rios, a 12-acre wetlands project downstream
from the Phoenix area's 91st Avenue Wastewater Treatment Plant.
</P>
<P>
   But it is more than a sanctuary for nearly 100 species of birds
and wildlife from javelinas to bobcats. It's an extension of the
plant itself, using nature as a filter to provide the final
cleaning stage for sewer water. The concept could end up saving
cities in the Phoenix area hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: Increased federal standards are expected for water
being released back into the environment. Phoenix officials say the
cost to upgrade a treatment plant such as the one at 91st Avenue to
meet those new standards could top $375 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a wetlands, we can do a full 800 acres for about $85
million,'' said Bing Brown, spokesman for Phoenix's Water Services
Department. ``It does the same thing, and does it better in some
cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to put up another building, or do you want a place
you can take your family to watch birds and watch lizards? If both
do about the same thing but one costs less and looks better, it
seems it's a shoo-in.''
</P>
<P>
   Before a city creates 800 acres of wetlands, though, it needs to
know whether the concept works.
</P>
<P>
   That led to Tres Rios, a demonstration project near 91st Avenue
and Broadway Road.
</P>
<P>
   Wastewater is processed through the nearby treatment plant and
pumped into the wetlands. As the water flows through plants and
vegetation, ``nature takes its course,'' cleansing the water of
nitrogen, metals, pesticides and the like. The water is collected
on the other end.
</P>
<P>
   Water that comes out of the plant is not used for drinking but
for irrigation and to cool towers at the Palo Verde Nuclear
Generating Station. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   Jack Landy, an environmental engineer with the Environmental
Protection Agency in San Francisco, said the EPA supports Tres Rios
and is impressed with the planning going into the project.
</P>
<P>
   There are other wetlands projects, including one in Show Low and
a couple in Tucson, but he said there's nothing on such a large
scale in this region, including Arizona, California, Nevada or
Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have enough experience with wetlands, though, that we're
confident it can work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A concern already expressed in meetings is the possibility of
mosquito breeding, but Landy said he hopes that can be prevented.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be supportive but attentive as to the
environmental impacts,'' he said. The EPA has not identified any
significant pollution from the discharge at this point, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of the 12-acre site began in 1995. About $8.5
million has been spent or committed so far from the federal
government and cities involved. Tres Rios is owned by a coalition
of Phoenix, Scottsdale, Glendale, Mesa and Tempe. It is operated in
partnership with the Bureau of Reclamation.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the cities say the project is more successful than
they anticipated, and they are pushing to build the 800 acres of
wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   The Army Corps of Engineers is studying the feasibility of the
larger project; the study is expected to be completed by May 2000.
The project would span an area near the Salt, Gila and Agua Fria
rivers, which is how it got the name Tres Rios, Spanish for ``three
rivers.''
</P>
<P>
   The 800-acre wetlands could have four different types of areas,
including ponds, marshes, streams and an area where the water would
flow underground.
</P>
<P>
   The lessons learned from the smaller demonstration project would
help the cities operate the full-scale wetlands, says Roland Wass,
research project manager at Tres Rios.
</P>
<P>
   Lessons like, watch out for the beavers.
</P>
<P>
   Up to a dozen now call Tres Rios home, including Brutus, who
weighs an estimated 70 pounds but still is slippery enough to avoid
getting caught. He's been busy building dams and dropping a 35-foot
tree in the middle of one of the ponds.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started, we never anticipated beavers,'' Wass said.
``Now it's a problem, but we're learning how to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The most important result of Tres Rios could be improved
wastewater at a fraction of the cost of what it would take to build
upgraded treatment plants.
</P>
<P>
   And there's the benefit that isn't financial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-five years down the road,'' Wass said, ``you have
usable real estate, not rusting chemical tanks.'' &QL;

 NEWS &AMP; FEATURE SUMMARY No. 2533 - April 12, 1999  
<TEXT>
<P>
   1. NATO'S BOMBS AND MOVIE BLOCKBUSTERS Even in its first days,
the crisis in Kosovo presented itself as a miniaturized, modernized
version of the vivid battle epics of the past season, ``Saving
Private Ryan'' and ``The Thin Red Line.'' In the analogy, Milosevic
is a low-rent Hitler; his ethnic cleansing, a B-movie Holocaust.
Early reports were peppered with Spielberg-like plot lines : the
rescue mission behind enemy lines that endangers many to save one,
the lumbering B-52 bombers still in service after all these years.
Once again we're fighting alongside our allies to stop the mass
murder of a helpless ethnic minority. By Jacob Weisberg. From The
New York Times Magazine. 1,000 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 2.
INSIDE THE KOSOVO LIBERATION ARMY After NATO's air strikes against
Yugoslavia, the Kosovo Liberation Army is set for a long guerilla
war to win an independent Kosovo now and a Greater Albania later.
To Washington's chagrin, the KLA rebels have supplanted Kosovo's
moderate leaders and won the support of most of its ethnic
Albanians. Chris Hedges, who writes from inside the rebel group,
says that Serbian brutality has left the KLA bent on secession.
From Foreign Affairs Magazine. (Hedges is currently a Neiman Fellow
at Harvard University; he was The New York Times' Balkan Bureau
chief from 1995 to 1998.) A. THE REBEL VOICE IN KOSOVO B. INSIDE
THE KOSOVO LIBERATION ARMY C. KOSOVO BECOMES A POLITICAL TIME BOMB
D. THE K.L.A. IS WILDLY UNLIKELY TO HAND OVER ITS GUNS
_______________________________________________________________ 3.
THE SPERMINATOR Reproduction is a individual, personal matter. We
cannot assume that a man pursuing parenthood while alive would have
wanted to father children from the grave. Yet, in fact, retrieving
sperm from the dead is now so common that the American Society of
Reproductive Medicine has developed a protocol, ``Posthumous
Reproduction,'' for dealing with it. And one bioethicist coined a
term for this new kind of father : the sperminator. By Lori B.
Andrews. From The New York Times Magazine. Full-length (3,300
words) + edited article available. 4. THE PHYSICS OF TRAFFIC Two
theoretical physicists ponder the snarly equation of highway
traffic and come up with possible cures for congestion. Using
computer models that treat cars on highways like molecules in a
gas, an American and German physicist team offer more than a road
paved with good intentions. By Robert Sapolsky. From Discover
Magazine. 1,000 words + photo.
_______________________________________________________________ 5.
TAKING THE THIRD The first person pronoun has been displaced in
America : I am no longer me, I am he. Is it a way to avoid
responsibility, to be less egocentric ... or what? By John Powers.
From The Boston Globe Magazine. 1,500 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 6.
TWENTY BOOKS TO PUT AN END TO CREEPY SEX Misbehaviour in high
places has given sex a bad name. Here is a selection of 20 books
that eliminate tawdry from torrid. In most cases, the 20
recommended books were written at a time when the boundaries of
censorship were still being defined and literary stakes were high.
By Richard Victory. From Washingtonian Magazine. 1,000 words. 7.
HAVE SKIS, HELICOPTER, AWE AND TERROR In what is commonly called
'helicopter skiiing,' participants fly by helicopter to the
mountain peaks and ski in deep power snow. The skis are wider and
shorter. Important differences also involve turning method and
basic body stance. By Holcomb B. Noble. From The New York Times
Science Times. 900 words + graphic. 8. WHEN NO-ONE READ, WHO
STARTED TO WRITE? When it comes to explaining the origins of
writing, scientists are largely at a loss. But many at a recent
symposium favoured a broad explanation of writing's origins in the
visual arts. Their views clashed with a widely-held theory that
writing grew out of the pieces of clay that Sumerian accountants
had used to keep track of livestock and stores of grain. By John
Noble Wilford. From The New York Times Science Times. 2,200 words +
photo + graphic.
_______________________________________________________________ 9.
THE INNER BEZOS Amazon.com's founder Jeff Bezos figured out how to
sell books on the web and now he wants to sell you everything else.
Simple, right? So why is he the only one pulling it off? By Chip
Bayers. From Wired Magazine. 5,000 words. (N/A Japan.)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; UNDER GEMINI: A MEMOIR &LR;  By Isabel Bolton. Steerforth, $12. The
author, whose novels were highly praised in the 1940s and '50s,
describes growing up as an orphan in turn-of-the-century
Massachusetts with her identical twin sister, who died in a
swimming accident at the age of 14. In 1966, in The New York Times
Book Review, Diana Trilling called this slender book an
``extraordinarily poignant memoir of her quite extraordinary
childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PRESTON FALLS &LR;  By David Gates. Vintage Contemporaries, $13. At
the center of this novel is a cynical, highly unlovable public
relations executive who takes a couple of months off to fix up his
family's getaway house in upstate New York. After a fight with his
wife lands him in jail, he hooks up with a lawyer who lures him
into cocaine trafficking. This scary tale of male vanity and the
dark underbelly of middle age was selected as one of the best books
of 1998 by the editors of The New York Times Book Review. ``You're
almost afraid to go back to the book once you've put it down,''
Michael Wood wrote last year. ``Anything could happen, and it's
likely to be horrible, irremediable.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ONE NATION, AFTER ALL. WHAT MIDDLE-CLASS AMERICANS REALLY THINK
ABOUT: GOD, COUNTRY, FAMILY, RACISM, WELFARE, IMMIGRATION,
HOMOSEXUALITY, WORK, THE RIGHT, THE LEFT, AND EACH OTHER &LR;  By Alan
Wolfe. Penguin, $13.95. Sifting through interviews with 200
middle-class folks of all stripes, a sociologist discovers far more
sympathy for civil rights, women's rights and religious diversity
than people often get credit for. This optimistic survey ``is a
fascinating and often stirring tour through an America that the
news media and would-be culture warriors seem not to know,'' Brent
Staples wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CIVILITY: MANNERS, MORALS, AND THE ETIQUETTE OF DEMOCRACY &LR;  By
Stephen L. Carter. Harper Perennial, $13. A law professor explores
the idea of civility (and incivility) from the evolution of
Euro-American etiquette to censorship in cyberspace, and urges a
more civil national discourse, especially where matters of faith
are concerned. ``His meditations on the tensions between democracy
and religion display ... eloquence and independence of mind,''
Michael Lind wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BIRTHDAY LETTERS &LR;  By Ted Hughes. Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $12.
The subject of these poems is Hughes' stormy relationship with
Sylvia Plath, and the result is an inevitably one-sided rebuke to
those who see him as the villain in Plath's 1963 suicide. Last year
the reviewer Katha Pollitt praised the ``emotional, direct,
regretful, entranced'' tone that ``pervades the book's strongest
poems, which are quiet and thoughtful and conversational.''
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has issued  &UR; TALES FROM OVID &LR;  ($14), in which
Hughes tackles the ironic, urbane Ovid of ancient Rome; somehow the
pairing clicks. ``The result is that rare thing _ an inspired act
of translation that stands as vigorous poetry in its own right,''
James Shapiro wrote in 1997. ``This book brilliantly succeeds at
bringing Ovid's passionate and disturbing stories to life.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BE SWEET: A CONDITIONAL LOVE STORY &LR;  By Roy Blount Jr.
Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $13. The humorist's unflinching account of
his Georgia childhood has everything to do with his mother, Louise,
a difficult woman whose mystery haunts her son into adulthood.
```Be Sweet' is both literary and down-home, a thinking man's thigh
slapper'' and ``a serious heartbreaker,'' Josephine Humphreys wrote
last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE LIFE OF INSECTS &LR;  By Victor Pelevin. Penguin, $11.95. The
human characters in this slippery Russian novel morph back and
forth into bugs _ chief among them are a trio of voracious
investors/mosquitoes and a sexy fly named Natasha. ``Political
allegory, antic fantasy, willful enigma: Victor Pelevin's latest
book ... is a little of all three,'' Michael Upchurch wrote in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A SHORT HISTORY OF BYZANTIUM &LR;  By John Julius Norwich. Vintage,
$17. This condensed version of the author's three-volume history
starts with the founding of Constantinople in 330 and its fall in
1453. ``Lord Norwich has sacrificed none of the virtues of the
longer work: lively narration and a taste for the eccentric
anecdote and revelatory detail,'' Michael Anderson wrote in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FROM THE HOLY MOUNTAIN: A JOURNEY AMONG THE CHRISTIANS OF THE
MIDDLE EAST &LR;  By William Dalrymple. Owl/Holt, $16.95. This retraces
the path of two monks who traveled in the Byzantine Empire in the
late sixth and early seventh centuries. ``Dalrymple is the
professor whose obscure lectures you attend just so you can hear
him talk,'' Ted Conover wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE ILLUSIONIST &LR;  By Dinitia Smith. Scribner, $12. This novel by
a reporter for The New York Times is about an androgynous man who
coasts into a rural New York town and the tragedy that results when
three lonely women are drawn into his web. The story's ``greatest
strength is the sensitivity with which Smith explores the
complexities of love,'' Edward Hower wrote in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SKIN DEEP &LR;  By Diana Wagman. University of Mississippi, $15. A
former topless waitress enters a peculiar relationship with a young
doctor who pays her well to shroud herself completely in blue and
talk about beauty. In 1997 the reviewer Courtney Weaver called this
``a curious and disturbing'' first novel.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, April 11, moved Saturday and are repeated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On the section dress page:
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-ECOSYSTEM-REVIEW (Undated) _ Scientists at the Xerox
Palo Alto Research Center have squeezed a big portion of the Web,
about 55 million pages, onto 400 billion bytes of disk space. Held
in captivity, this Web in a box is poked and prodded by researchers
studying it like a great beast _ or, to use the metaphor they
prefer, like an ecosystem. They seek the laws by which the members
of the planetary community of Internet foragers compete and
cooperate in the constant search for information. The Internet is a
living laboratory to study mass human behavior with a precision and
scale never possible before. By George Johnson. (`a' category)
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-GENOCIDE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Amid growing signs of a
genocidal campaign by Serbian forces against Kosovo's Albanians,
the conduct of ordinary Serbs is starting to attract the kinds of
questions raised in Daniel Jonah Goldhagen's book, `Hitler's
Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust.'
Goldhagen himself thinks that questioning the behavior of the
Serbian nation at this moment is not only fitting but essential. By
Michael T. Kaufman. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-NATO-REVIEW (Brussels) _ NATO has been planning a 50th
anniversary summit this month to chart a new `strategic concept'
defining its role in European security. But that role is instead
being redefined in Kosovo. The role has become that of a bulwark
against the consequences of ethnic instability in Europe's
southeastern periphery, which is today the biggest threat to
European security, just as it was a century ago. If it cannot
resolve the Kosovo crisis, NATO may go the way of the League of
Nations. By Craig R. Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MIDEAST-REVIEW (Damascus) _ NATO's punishment of Serb
Christians for their persecution of Kosovar Muslims presented the
Islamic world with a campaign that it could identify with. After
all, the U.S. and its allies were siding with Muslims this time,
not bashing Iraq or supporting Israel. But while sympathies for the
Kosovars are strong in the Muslim Middle East, they are tangled
with an abiding mistrust of the West, whose use of force against
the Serbs is seen as less than heroic. By Douglas Jehl.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-FUGITIVES-REVIEW (Mexico City) _ A look at the
frequently-occurring phenomenon of Mexican government officials who
are accused of corruption and then flee. There are so many such
cases that, to Mexicans, the public figure turned fugitive has
become a cliche. `In our system, there's a thin line separating
public officials from outlaws, and legality from illegality,' said
poet Homero Aridjis. `Overnight, they can leave behind their
prerogatives of power and turn into fugitives.' By Sam Dillon.
</P>
<P>
   GADHAFI-LOCKERBIE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Sources close to Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi say his agreement to turn over the suspects
in the Lockerbie jetliner bombing was not greatly influenced by
sanctions or other economic pressures. A need to end his isolation
and salvage his place in history may have been the most important
factor. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   COLDWAR-HEROES-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Cold War Recognition
Certificate took its place in the pantheon of military honors last
week, when the Pentagon began accepting applications. Anyone who
served in the armed forces or in one of several federal government
positions between Sept. 2, 1945, when Japan surrendered to the
U.S., and Dec. 25, 1991, when Mikhail Gorbachev resigned as
president of the Soviet Union, is eligible to apply. The
certificate could go to as many as 22 million people. It carries no
financial benefits or privileges whatever _ but, oh, the glory! By
David Stout.
</P>
<P>
   TAX-CUT-REVIEW (Washington) _ Recent public quiescence on the
issue of taxes is puzzling to conservatives who think that the time
is ripe for significant tax cutting or a sweeping overhaul of the
tax code. But Americans appear to have turned their political
energies and interests elsewhere. Although they would not reject a
tax cut, polls indicate many would prefer the money be dedicated to
Social Security or other programs. So congressional Republicans
have been working to tell Americans that they don't have to choose.
By Alison Mitchell. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   ECON-JOBLESS-REVIEW (Washington) Unemployment has been falling
for seven years and economic growth remains robust. By conventional
economic theory, this should be producing inflation. But in fact,
inflation is nowhere to be found. And while theoretical economists
have been debating the issue for years, doubts about this
conventional wisdom on unemployment are now are beginning to change
the way the Federal Reserve sets policy. By Richard W. Stevenson.

<P>
   CONFIDENTIAL-SOURCES-REVIEW (Cincinnati) _ Cincinnati Enquirer
reporter Mike Gallagher's decision to reveal the identity of a
confidential source, along with notes, documents and secretly taped
conversations, is echoing through the legal and journalistic

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, April 11, moved Saturday and are repeated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On the section dress page:
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-ECOSYSTEM-REVIEW (Undated) _ Scientists at the Xerox
Palo Alto Research Center have squeezed a big portion of the Web,
about 55 million pages, onto 400 billion bytes of disk space. Held
in captivity, this Web in a box is poked and prodded by researchers
studying it like a great beast _ or, to use the metaphor they
prefer, like an ecosystem. They seek the laws by which the members
of the planetary community of Internet foragers compete and
cooperate in the constant search for information. The Internet is a
living laboratory to study mass human behavior with a precision and
scale never possible before. By George Johnson. (`a' category)
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-GENOCIDE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Amid growing signs of a
genocidal campaign by Serbian forces against Kosovo's Albanians,
the conduct of ordinary Serbs is starting to attract the kinds of
questions raised in Daniel Jonah Goldhagen's book, `Hitler's
Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust.'
Goldhagen himself thinks that questioning the behavior of the
Serbian nation at this moment is not only fitting but essential. By
Michael T. Kaufman. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-NATO-REVIEW (Brussels) _ NATO has been planning a 50th
anniversary summit this month to chart a new `strategic concept'
defining its role in European security. But that role is instead
being redefined in Kosovo. The role has become that of a bulwark
against the consequences of ethnic instability in Europe's
southeastern periphery, which is today the biggest threat to
European security, just as it was a century ago. If it cannot
resolve the Kosovo crisis, NATO may go the way of the League of
Nations. By Craig R. Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MIDEAST-REVIEW (Damascus) _ NATO's punishment of Serb
Christians for their persecution of Kosovar Muslims presented the
Islamic world with a campaign that it could identify with. After
all, the U.S. and its allies were siding with Muslims this time,
not bashing Iraq or supporting Israel. But while sympathies for the
Kosovars are strong in the Muslim Middle East, they are tangled
with an abiding mistrust of the West, whose use of force against
the Serbs is seen as less than heroic. By Douglas Jehl.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-FUGITIVES-REVIEW (Mexico City) _ A look at the
frequently-occurring phenomenon of Mexican government officials who
are accused of corruption and then flee. There are so many such
cases that, to Mexicans, the public figure turned fugitive has
become a cliche. `In our system, there's a thin line separating
public officials from outlaws, and legality from illegality,' said
poet Homero Aridjis. `Overnight, they can leave behind their
prerogatives of power and turn into fugitives.' By Sam Dillon.
</P>
<P>
   GADHAFI-LOCKERBIE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Sources close to Libyan
leader Moammar Gadhafi say his agreement to turn over the suspects
in the Lockerbie jetliner bombing was not greatly influenced by
sanctions or other economic pressures. A need to end his isolation
and salvage his place in history may have been the most important
factor. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   COLDWAR-HEROES-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Cold War Recognition
Certificate took its place in the pantheon of military honors last
week, when the Pentagon began accepting applications. Anyone who
served in the armed forces or in one of several federal government
positions between Sept. 2, 1945, when Japan surrendered to the
U.S., and Dec. 25, 1991, when Mikhail Gorbachev resigned as
president of the Soviet Union, is eligible to apply. The
certificate could go to as many as 22 million people. It carries no
financial benefits or privileges whatever _ but, oh, the glory! By
David Stout.
</P>
<P>
   TAX-CUT-REVIEW (Washington) _ Recent public quiescence on the
issue of taxes is puzzling to conservatives who think that the time
is ripe for significant tax cutting or a sweeping overhaul of the
tax code. But Americans appear to have turned their political
energies and interests elsewhere. Although they would not reject a
tax cut, polls indicate many would prefer the money be dedicated to
Social Security or other programs. So congressional Republicans
have been working to tell Americans that they don't have to choose.
By Alison Mitchell. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   ECON-JOBLESS-REVIEW (Washington) Unemployment has been falling
for seven years and economic growth remains robust. By conventional
economic theory, this should be producing inflation. But in fact,
inflation is nowhere to be found. And while theoretical economists
have been debating the issue for years, doubts about this
conventional wisdom on unemployment are now are beginning to change
the way the Federal Reserve sets policy. By Richard W. Stevenson.
WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   CONFIDENTIAL-SOURCES-REVIEW (Cincinnati) _ Cincinnati Enquirer
reporter Mike Gallagher's decision to reveal the identity of a
confidential source, along with notes, documents and secretly taped
conversations, is echoing through the legal and journalistic
communities as a major assault on the revered principle of
protecting sources. The case is raising new questions about the
legal rights of sources who are burned by journalists. By Douglas
Frantz.
</P>
<P>
   ENTREPRENEUR-ADS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Get-rich-quick schemes
have been around a long time. But with this era's remarkable
economic expansion and concurrent growth of home-based businesses,
magazines that cater to small-scale entrepreneurs lately have
become thick with ads placing the home business smack dab on the
road to Easy Street.

   Hoping for an Instant Replay &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On opening day of the baseball season in St. Louis, the luster,
the drama and anticipation _ the pure pleasure _ of much of last
season appeared to have hardly skipped a beat. As soon as Mark
McGwire came up to bat in the Cardinals' half of the first inning,
the sellout crowd of nearly 50,000 stood and cheered. And they kept
standing in prolonged homage as the millennium's Sultan of Swat _
the huge, rippling-muscled man who last season hit 70 homers,
breaking Roger Maris' hallowed, single-season home-run record by an
amazing nine _ walked. He struck out in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   But in the fifth McGwire, naturally, homered.
</P>
<P>
   Could this have been a harbinger of another resounding baseball
season, a season like the one that clearly marked a return for many
to the so-called national pastime, something that had been in
rather bad odor since the strike of 1994?
</P>
<P>
   Would McGwire and his virtual doppelganger, Sammy Sosa, make
another run at the record? Would the sullen Albert Belle, who also
homered in his first game for the Orioles? Could the Yankees
possibly repeat their magnificent performance? Might a Tony Gwynn
streak to a batting average of .400 for the year? Might there be
exciting division races, something lacking last season?
</P>
<P>
   However it turns out, it seemed that on opening day a nation was
returning with gusto to the days when it wanted to be taken out to
the ball game, to have some peanuts and Cracker Jack, and not to
care if it ever got back.

<P>
   Breaking a Family Tradition &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For a time, it looked as if the son would go the way of the
father, toughing it out in great style. But John A. Gotti had
learned another lesson from watching his father: If the government
wants to put away a mobster, it can be pit-bull relentless. It
tried John J. Gotti four times before convicting him of murder in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   So on the eve of his trial, the younger Gotti cut a deal that
would give him what his lawyers, using parlance not customarily
heard in the underworld, described as ``closure.'' With striking
humility, Gotti pleaded guilty in White Plains, N.Y., to running a
criminal racket. The charges could send him to prison for seven
years, but Gotti received assurances that the plea would end all
other investigations.
</P>
<P>
   What prompted Gotti to fold his cards was learning that the
names of his jurors would be kept secret _ heightening the jurors'
sense that they had something to fear from Gotti _ and that even if
he won in White Plains he would soon be indicted in Brooklyn.

<P>
   An Inauspicious Start for a Chinese Premier's Visit  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Curse the stars, or whatever one blames for bad timing, but
Prime Minister Zhu Rongji of China walked into a minefield when he
visited Washington on the second stop on his nine-day, six-city
tour of America. The 70-year-old Chinese leader, known for his
hands-on management of his nation's economy and for his blunt
speaking style, impressed people in the capital with his candor.
But he blamed U.S. politics for the failure to close a deal for
China to enter the World Trade Organization, an agreement both
Chinese and U.S. negotiators said was agonizingly close.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said China was ``not quite there yet'' on its
long-standing application to join the world regulatory body on
trade. But the real issue was the sour political environment,
including fresh concerns about human rights and Chinese pilferage
of U.S. military secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Two months earlier or later, the two sides might have been able
to close the deal and send Zhu home with a prize, one Chinese
official ruminated. As it is, they will now go back to the
negotiating table and try to sign an agreement by the end of the
year. And Zhu, demonstrating a Chinese version of a stiff upper
lip, continued his tour of the United States with a stop in Denver,
to be followed by Chicago, New York and Boston.

   Check Out Your Driver
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court handed a warning to automobile passengers: You
give up your privacy rights when you get into the car, and if the
driver gets into trouble with the law, so may you.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled that as long as police have probable cause to
search a car for illegal drugs or other contraband, they can search
all closed containers in the car, including, in this case, a
passenger's pocketbook.
</P>
<P>
   Police need not suspect the passenger of a crime, Justice
Antonin Scalia said for the 6-3 majority, explaining that
``passengers, no less than drivers, possess a reduced expectation
of privacy'' when they get into a car.

   Too Much Cash? Just Give It Away.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Flush with cash from the soaring stock market, the nation's
foundations gave away a record amount of money last year, according
to a recent study. Foundations made an estimated $19.5 billion in
grants in 1998 to not-for-profit organizations, according to the
Foundation Center, a New York group that tracks foundation giving.
The amount represents an increase of about 41 percent since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The bull market has made donors more generous and fattened
endowments, according to the Foundation Center, which based its
1998 estimates on survey responses from more than 1,000
organizations.

   Accusations of Overcharging at Nuclear Cleanup Sites
</P>
<P>
   Cleaning up radioactive pollution at former nuclear weapons
plants has been tedious for workers and expensive for taxpayers,
although generally profitable for the contractors. Now an
accountant for two contractors at the Hanford nuclear reservation
in Washington state has filed a suit that says the contractors have
been illegally marking up their bills, adding overhead charges to
expenses that do not qualify.
</P>
<P>
   The contractors acted like a restaurant that pockets the
waitress' tips, according to the accountant, David Carbaugh, who
also claims he was fired for trying to alert the Energy Department.
The contractors, Fluor Daniel Hanford and Westinghouse Hanford Co.,
deny the charges, which were filed in U.S. District Court in
Spokane.

<P>
   A Guilty Plea in the Kidnapping and Murder of a Gay Man
</P>
<P>
   In Laramie, Wyo., where the murder of Matthew Shepard six months
ago provoked national soul-searching over violence against gay
people, Russell Henderson pleaded guilty to kidnapping and
murdering Shepard, a college student. He was sentenced to serve two
consecutive life terms in prison.
</P>
<P>
   To escape the death penalty, Henderson may have bargained with
prosecutors to testify in August in the capital murder trial of his
former friend, Aaron McKinney. In court, Henderson said McKinney
was the mastermind of the crime, choosing the student as a victim,
and then beating him savagely.
</P>
<P>
   Wyoming authorities have declined to classify the murder as a
hate crime or a murder motivated by hatred of gays.
</P>
<P>
   McKinney is expected to try to use the ``gay panic'' defense,
arguing that his uncontrollable anger was ignited by a sexual
advance by Shepard.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a Denver television reporter, obtained letters
written from jail by McKinney. In one letter peppered with
misspellings, McKinney, a high-school dropout, wrote to a female
friend that Shepard ``said he was gay and wanted a piece of me.''
In response, he wrote, ``Being verry drunk and homofobick I flipped
out and began to pistol whip'' the student.

   Drastic Action to Seal Leaks of Nuclear Secrets
</P>
<P>
   The current furor over the Clinton administration's handling of
evidence of Chinese atomic espionage is now forcing the
administration to scramble to plug leaks at America's three major
nuclear weapons laboratories, where it has been accused of
responding sluggishly to security problems.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most dramatic actions taken since the spy scandal
erupted last month, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson ordered a
suspension of all scientific work on the computer networks
containing America's most sensitive nuclear weapons secrets at the
Los Alamos, Sandia and Lawrence-Livermore laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   He took the action because he was convinced that security
problems had left the computer networks vulnerable to espionage.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Richardson decided to close down the networks for an
indefinite period after receiving an internal review that found
that security measures at Los Alamos and Lawrence-Livermore were
still below standard.
</P>
<P>
   Closing down the classified computer networks affects thousands
of workers at the weapons labs, and effectively halts most
classified work related to the maintenance of the U.S. nuclear
weapons inventory.

responding sluggishly to security problems.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most dramatic actions taken since the spy scandal
erupted last month, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson ordered a
suspension of all scientific work on the computer networks
containing America's most sensitive nuclear weapons secrets at the
Los Alamos, Sandia and Lawrence-Livermore laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   He took the action because he was convinced that security
problems had left the computer networks vulnerable to espionage.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Richardson decided to close down the networks for an
indefinite period after receiving an internal review that found
that security measures at Los Alamos and Lawrence-Livermore were
still below standard.
</P>
<P>
   Closing down the classified computer networks affects thousands
of workers at the weapons labs, and effectively halts most
classified work related to the maintenance of the U.S. nuclear
weapons inventory.

EARCHING FOR THE ESSENCE OF THE WORLD WIDE WEB

   Gazing through a computer screen onto the vast expanse of the
World Wide Web, one feels like an explorer perched at the edge of
an endless wilderness. It's a bit of a letdown, then, to learn how
very finite the whole place really is.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at a company called Alexa Internet, using computers
to automatically plumb the depths of this ocean of information,
recently estimated that, as of last summer, the Web was three
terabytes in size _ three trillion bytes of information, about
5,000 CD-ROMs. Just about the whole thing would fit onto Sun
Microsystem's top-of-the-line StorEdge A7000 Intelligent Storage
Server, an array of speedy hard-disk drives occupying less than 150
cubic feet. This cyberspace that people have been romping around in
could be squeezed inside a bedroom closet.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not the size of the Web that matters. As the world is
increasingly coming to appreciate, physical space and cyberspace
operate according to different rules.
</P>
<P>
   In what they describe as a new science of Webology, computer
scientists at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center in Silicon Valley
recently funneled a large portion of the Web, about 55 million
pages (leaving out the pictures), onto 400 billion bytes of disk
space. Held in captivity in Palo Alto, this Web in a Box is poked
and prodded, studied like a great beast _ or, to use the metaphor
the researchers prefer, like an ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of this simulation, and by probing the real,
living Web with electronic signals, they seek laws by which the
members of the planetary community of Internet foragers compete and
cooperate in the constant search for information. The Internet has
become a living laboratory, a place to study mass human behavior
with a precision and on a scale never possible before.
</P>
<P>
   ``No central authority has cultivated the Web as a beautiful
garden,'' said Dr. Bernardo Huberman, an Internet ecologist at
Xerox PARC. ``It grows on its own like an ecosystem.'' Informavores
hunting down an interesting site link it to their own, and that
site is soon linked to others, forming a vast spider web of
connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sheer reach and structural complexity of the Web makes it
an ecology of knowledge, with relationships, information `food
chains,' and dynamic interactions that could soon become as rich
as, if not richer than, many natural ecosystems,'' Huberman wrote
in a paper last year with his colleagues Peter Pirolli, James
Pitkow and Rajan Lukose.
</P>
<P>
   But it is hard to find the right metaphor for something so
strange. Viewed in real time, with data seekers buzzing from site
to site, the Web can seem like a swarm of virtual insects, one
whose flutterings (in the form of mouse clicks) can be recorded and
sifted for clues to behavioral laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not doing computer science,'' Huberman said, ``but
something more akin to social science.'' What strategies do people
use to hunt down information? Why, for no apparent reason, do
storms of activity suddenly surge through the Internet, causing the
whole thing to grind to a halt? And why, just as mysteriously, do
these information fronts suddenly subside?
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Web began to burgeon, barely under human control,
people have been straining to relate it to something familiar _ an
ecosystem, the weather, an unruly crowd at a rock concert. The Web
is a great ocean on which you surf from site to site. It's a
cyberspace with a topology of its own: Two points distant in
physical space can be adjacent in cyberspace, a single mouse click
away. But an e-mail message sent in an instant to a neighbor next
door might be routed through a maze of links extending thousands of
miles.
</P>
<P>
   Lada Adamic, a Stanford University graduate student working on
Xerox PARC's Internet ecology project, recently found that
cyberspace, like the world described in the John Guare play ``Six
Degrees of Separation,'' is a small place indeed. Just as any two
people on Earth are said to be connected by a human chain of
acquaintance with no more than a few links, so can you pick two Web
sites at random and get from one to the other with about four
clicks.
</P>
<P>
   The research quantifies what Web users intuitively know: Because
of the high density of connections, it can be surprisingly easy to
find information in what amounts to a library without a card
catalog, filled with unindexed books.
</P>
<P>
   The thunderstorms of congestion on the Net, another study found,
can be analyzed in terms of crowd behavior. (Meteorology, sociology
_ the metaphors inevitably clash.) Sudden clots of congestion can
sometimes be traced to obvious causes, like the recent virtual
lingerie show of Victoria's Secret. More often they arise and
quickly dissipate for obscure reasons best understood using what
social scientists call game theory.
</P>
<P>
   You log on to the Internet and find the playing field uncrowded.
With Web sites popping up as quickly as you touch their links, you
click more and more, downloading video files and sound tracks with
little regard for the capacity, or ``bandwidth,'' you are
consuming. Millions of other players are selfishly doing the same.
Inevitably the activity reaches a threshold and connection speeds
start to crawl.
</P>
<P>
   Should you stay around, knowing that others will soon give up in
frustration, leaving you more room? Or will you gain in the long
run if you help relieve the congestion, logging off until the storm
has probably blown by? You must decide, in terms of game theory,
whether to defect from the common good or cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a classic social dilemma, a vastly larger-scale
version of what happens when you are confronted with a steady busy
signal at the theater box office and must decide whether to call
back later or set your phone on constant redial. Short spikes of
congestion are followed by lulls _ a pattern that can be predicted
statistically and verified by ``pinging'' the Net, as the engineers
say, bouncing thousands of packets of information off a particular
site and timing in milliseconds how long they take to return.
</P>
<P>
   From measuring millions of mouse clicks, another study has
derived a mathematical ``law of surfing'' predicting how many pages
one typically visits within a single Web site _ about 1{, a finding
that has been of keen interest to Internet entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   As the Web continues to grow exponentially (with everyone
someday as likely to have a Web page as a street address), it will
become an ever richer distillation of human behavior. Even the
dead, discontinued pages will be around for scholars to scrutinize.
</P>
<P>
   A group called the Internet Archive in San Francisco has
collected and stored on disks and tapes more than a billion Web
pages, exceeding 13 terabytes. (The entire Library of Congress has
been estimated to contain 20 terabytes of text.) The plan is to
provide snapshots, year by year, of just what the great terrestrial
brain has been thinking.

LOOKING FOR THE LINE BETWEEN PATRIOTISM AND GUILT 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In view of the accumulating evidence of a genocidal campaign
unleashed against Kosovo's Albanians by Serbian forces directed by
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, the conduct of ordinary
Serbs is starting to attract the kinds of questions raised in
Daniel Jonah Goldhagen's book, ``Hitler's Willing Executioners,
Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversial book examined how some longstanding
``eliminationist'' myths within German culture predisposed what
might be thought of as normal citizens to accept, support and in
many instances actively carry out Nazi policies of Jewish
extermination. Those policies remain a benchmark of evil in this
century, and there are, of course, great differences of scale
distinguishing what happened in Germany from what is happening in
Serbia. Nonetheless, focusing on actions of common men and women in
both places and the willingness of many to follow murderous leads,
does not, at the moment, seem inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Goldhagen himself thinks that questioning the behavior of the
Serbian nation is essential. ``Right now is the time when we must
ask the question of how ordinary people have acted while it can
still influence events. Those who support what has been happening
in Kosovo should be made aware that they will be held complicit in
what will most likely be the last enormous crime of the century,''
said Goldhagen, a professor of government at Harvard who is working
on a study of genocide in the last 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Former Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, who is also a
former U.S. ambassador to Yugoslavia, raised a similar point last
week in an op-ed article in The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
   ``Although Milosevic is the prime mover behind the murder and
agony that have filled our television screens for the better part
of a decade, he has not acted alone. He may plan the strategy, but
the Serbian people are the willing instruments of his terror. There
are, of course, many decent Serbs who decry the violence, just as
there were decent Germans under Hitler, but that does not excuse
the Serb nation for its part in making a killing field of so much
of the former Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually, and probably rightly, issues of collective
responsibility remain taboo in polite society. Within the
pluralistic tradition, there is a reluctance to assign guilt to
all, or most, or even many citizens of an offending state, and
instead focus blame on culpable leaders. But as Goldhagen has
persuasively argued, there was a correlation between Hitler's
policies of extermination and the willingness of a sizable German
population to support such ideas. In an escalating manner the
actions of the Nazi leader and the approval of those he led
mutually reinforced and encouraged each other.
</P>
<P>
   And while, as Eagleburger noted, there are Serbs who have
deplored the violence, a similar reverberating process has been
under way in Serbia since 1987, when Milosevic broke Titoism's
major precept of never discussing ethnic tensions in public.
Instead, he openly played to Serb nationalist sentiments, affirming
widespread Serb feelings of victimization and martyrdom stretching
back centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The sense of the collusive relationship between Milosevic and
the populace that both empowers and follows him has been evident in
the tone of such Serbian public expression as has reached beyond
Yugoslav territory. Some has been in the form of e-mail messages to
media organizations, universities, and addresses pulled out of the
air, like messages placed in bottles and thrown into the ocean.
There have also been the images of people at rock-concert rallies
in Belgrade and other cities, dancing in defiance of NATO and in
support of the man they call Slobo. According to sources in
Belgrade, the first of these rallies, which included some placards
critical of the leader, was spontaneous, but later ones were
organized and criticism disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   What is so striking about these expressions is how stridently
they clash with images of other people that the world has been
watching, images of people burned out of their homes, standing in
lines that have stretched for 15 miles trying to enter countries
that have no room for them or do not want them. Or images of people
from many different villages telling the same stories _ of their
friends and relatives shot and killed, of men being taken away to
places unknown. All of this is happening to Albanians at the hands
of Serbs less than 200 miles from Belgrade, but given the responses
of Serbs it might as well be taking place on the moon. Even in
1913, during a similar uprooting of Kosovars, there were louder
voices of dissent in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, neither Serbs nor any other people can be expected to
look much beyond their own fear and suffering when their cities are
being struck by rockets and bombs. It is unrealistic to assume that
any Serb might denounce the Serb assault on Albanians or that any
such cry inside the country would be loud enough to be heard above
the cheering and rallying around the chants of wartime chauvinism.
</P>
<P>
   Those few media organs in Serbia that have bravely struggled for
years to maintain independence in the face of government control
have been squelched. The radio station B-92 was shut down by police
last week but even before that it reported that it was not able to
report on what was happening in Kosovo. The journal Vreme has
suddenly suspended its previous criticism of the government.
</P>
<P>
   The images of the Albanian refugees that have been telecast all
over the world have not been carried by Serbian television and have
been seen only by those Serbians who have dish antennas and cable
service.
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible that people just don't know what is happening to
the Albanians and that therefore they bear little or no
responsibility for the support they show? Here too, Goldhagen saw
similarities with the Nazi period. ``How many Germans knew that
there was a formal program of Jewish extermination? My guess is not
many, but almost all knew that their civilization was killing Jews
by the tens of thousands.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that it would require a sizable force to burn villages
and set hundreds of thousands of residents to flight and that the
people carrying out such tasks all have relatives and friends who
would bring the accounts to general attention.

   The images of the Albanian refugees that have been telecast all
over the world have not been carried by Serbian television and have
been seen only by those Serbians who have dish antennas and cable
service.
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible that people just don't know what is happening to
the Albanians and that therefore they bear little or no
responsibility for the support they show? Here too, Goldhagen saw
similarities with the Nazi period. ``How many Germans knew that
there was a formal program of Jewish extermination? My guess is not
many, but almost all knew that their civilization was killing Jews
by the tens of thousands.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that it would require a sizable force to burn villages
and set hundreds of thousands of residents to flight and that the
people carrying out such tasks all have relatives and friends who
would bring the accounts to general attention.

<P>
   The e-mail from Serbia is characterized by an overwhelming sense
of defensiveness and unredeemed victimization. As the
correspondents denounce NATO and the United States, there is no
sense that the rockets are a response to Serb conduct. The
Albanians, if they are mentioned at all, are referred to as Muslims
who wish to establish a base for guerrilla terror, or narcotics
traffickers, or former allies and beneficiaries of the Ottoman
Turks. As for Serbs, they are persistently portrayed as defenders
of Christianity in Europe, heroic fighters in two world wars whose
contributions to civilization have gone unrewarded. Even writers
who identify themselves as Milosevic's opponents show more scorn
than sympathy for the Kosovar Albanians, blaming them for keeping
him in power by boycotting elections rather than voting with the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the letters mention the sacredness of Kosovo to Serbs
and cite the battle there in 1389 at which they were defeated by
the Turks. There are far fewer references to the more contemporary
history of Serb conflicts with Croats and Bosnians over the last
eight years. For instance no one mentions the destruction of
Vukovar by Serbs in 1991 or the massacre of Bosnian men and boys in
Srebrenica in 1995, an atrocity for which the military and
political leaders of the Bosnian Serbs have been indicted. Such
things appear to be missing from the current context although there
are occasional accurate references to the Croats having waged
campaigns of ethnic cleansing that chased Serbs into flight.
</P>
<P>
   But where does patriotism end and complicity in war crimes
begin? Surely there is a difference between people who are chanting
``Slobo, Slobo'' and those who are burning homes, separating wives
and husbands, and shooting civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Aryeh Neier, the president of the Open Society Institute and the
author of ``War Crimes, Brutality, Genocide, Terror and the
Struggle for Justice,'' argues that in recent wars like those in
Rwanda and Bosnia, there was a greater degree of criminal
responsibility on the part of ordinary citizens than was the case
in Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
   With the Nazis, he pointed out, the killing was highly
bureaucratized, and the victims were generally unknown to those who
killed them. In Rwanda and Bosnia, he said, many of the
perpetrators knew the victims, often having lived with them, gone
to school with them and in some cases married into their families.
In both places, Neier said, because of the way people were killed,
there were almost as many killers as victims.
</P>
<P>
   As for Kosovo, he said there was insufficient information to
determine what was happening or how to apportion responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   In Tirana, the Albanian capital, there lives an Albanian writer
named Fatos Lubunja, who under the regime of the late dictator
Enver Hoxa spent 17 years in prison. Now he edits an intellectual
journal and monitors human rights abuses. In a message to a friend
he traced many instances of Serb attacks on Albanians, dating from
expulsion in 1878 when Milan Obrenovic, a Serbian king, rallied his
countrymen with the words, ``The more Albanians you kick out of our
land the greater patriots you will be.'' Lubunja cited ethnic
cleansing campaigns of 1913 and 1920, and then he addressed the
questions that Goldhagen raised in his book.
</P>
<P>
   He was, he said, suspicious of judgments based on assumptions
that people inevitably repeat the conduct of their ancestors. ``But
if we can speak of collective guilt, I think we have to consider a
long historical process of manipulation; all those politicians,
historians, writers, teachers, who have created and nourished some
dangerous myths, have manipulated history and, in the end, created
those closed-minded horrible human beings who are ready to kill the
others.''

THE MUSLIM WORLD'S VIEW: TWO CHEERS _ IF THAT _ FOR U.S. BOMBS IN
KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By DOUGLAS JEHL

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria _ Two weeks into the Western bombardment of
Yugoslavia, with the air attacks aimed at punishing Christian Serbs
for their persecution of Muslim Kosovars, the Islamic world was
presented with a U.S. military campaign that it could identify
with. After all, the United States and its allies were clearly
siding with Muslims this time, not reflexively bashing Iraq or
unstintingly supporting Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But the reaction has been anything but simple. Sympathies for
the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo, most of whom are Muslims, are
strong in the Muslim Middle East, but they are tangled with another
powerful sentiment _ an abiding mistrust of the West, whose resort
to force against the Serbs is being seen as something much less
than heroic.
</P>
<P>
   Only Jordan and Egypt have even gone so far as to withdraw their
ambassadors from Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital. Not a single Arab
government has openly endorsed the Western airstrikes, and Iraq,
Libya and Iran have condemned them.
</P>
<P>
   In the Islamic world, of course, the Kosovars who have been
driven from their homes are much more than generic civilians. They
are fellow Muslims, and many in the Middle East believe they are
being made to suffer because of religion. In genuine solidarity,
Arab and Muslim countries have dispatched tents, food and other
supplies to the Balkans to assist the victims.
</P>
<P>
   But against the backdrop of recent history, the U.S.-led air
operations are being viewed by most Arabs and Muslims with an
uneasy ambivalence. One source of the discomfort is a gnawing
suspicion that the offensive may have accelerated the exodus. A
larger reason, more unique to the Middle East, is rooted deeply in
the way most Arabs and Muslims look at recent history. Until the
Kosovo crisis began, after all, the focus of U.S. military might
had been squarely on the Islamic world, with cruise-missile strikes
in Afghanistan, Sudan and Iraq in the last eight months alone.
</P>
<P>
   In each of those cases, Arab and Muslim leaders have voiced
protests, contending that at least the attacks should have been
preceded by U.N. authorization. And yet, once again in Kosovo, the
United States and its allies have bypassed the United Nations,
intensifying what in Arab eyes was already a worrying trend.
</P>
<P>
   It may be Serbs, not Muslims who are targets, but the current
offensive appears to many Arabs and other Muslims as more of the
same: a fresh case of Western heavy-handedness. The next time the
United States and its allies decide to unleash military might, they
warn, a Muslim country will likely again be the target. And that
next time, the West will have crossed another important threshold,
having carried out a sustained military operation without even
paying heed to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is any Muslim feeling safer?'' asked Iran's supreme leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, bitterly in a speech in Tehran last week,
in a reference to the attack on the Serbs. He said of the West,
``In the name of democracy, they feel entitled to use the strongest
measures against those who disagree with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the reaction has not been altogether uniform, and some
Arab intellectuals who have in the past been outspoken critics of
the West have begun to speak out against fellow Arabs for their
standoffishness.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamist author Fahmy Howeidy, writing in the Egyptian
newspaper Al Ahram, compared the horror unfolding in the Balkans
with the ``slaughter and mayhem unleashed by the Tartars seven
centuries ago in the sacking of Baghdad, an infamous turning point
in Islamic history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt that what the Serbs are doing in Kosovo is
even worse,'' Howeidy wrote, adding: ``Anyone who purports
neutrality is a traitor to the wretched Muslims of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   But most other Arab commentators, and Arab leaders themselves,
have shied away from casting the conflict as a religious war, an
idea that many warn is a dangerously volatile proposition. And
while the United States and its allies have vowed that the Kosovar
refugees will be returned to their homeland, the exodus of the
Kosovars has served to remind many Arabs of what they recall as a
past Western betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   In the Middle East, the flight of the Kosovars to Macedonia and
Albania looks much like the flight of Palestinians to Jordan, Syria
and Lebanon after the creation of Israel in 1948. That, too, was
described at the time as a temporary uprooting, but it has proven
effectively permanent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is history repeating itself?'' The Syria Times asked last
week, questioning whether the United States and its allies will
prove any more willing to fight for the return of the Kosovars than
they were for a return of the Palestinians who are still in refugee
camps around the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   The skepticism reflects a gap between Arab public opinion and
U.S. policy that has only widened in recent years, driven mostly by
Arab bitterness toward what is seen as Washington's one-sided
handling of Israel and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, Arab culture does tend to put a
premium on skepticism. And so in coffee houses and salons, all
kinds of theories are being floated, including the idea that the
West's true motive in bombing is not to help the Kosovars at all,
but to hurt them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't forget that this is the land of conspiracy,'' said Nabil
Samman, a Syrian political commentator. ``And many people think
that this is a conspiracy between NATO and the Serbs to drive the
Albanians out.''

WAR TEACHES NATO WHAT ITS ROLE IS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ The leaders of NATO have long been planning
a summit meeting in Washington from April 23 to 25 to celebrate the
alliance's first 50 years and chart a new ``strategic concept''
defining its role in European security in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, that role is being defined in practice in
Kosovo, not on paper in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The role right now is that of a bulwark against the consequences
of ethnic instability in Europe's southeastern rim. For that, much
more than Russian nuclear bombs, is today the biggest threat to
European security, as it was a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   And if NATO cannot defeat the effort by President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia to drive the ethnic Albanian population out
of the historic Serbian province of Kosovo, the alliance risks
going the way of the League of Nations and other failed
20th-century attempts to deal with the same ethnic instability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to stop this tragedy of great dimensions, caused by
somebody who has a name, Slobodan Milosevic,'' said NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana. As a young man during the Cold
War, he opposed Spain's entry into the alliance. Now, still a
socialist who describes himself as a Social Democrat, he defines
the purpose of the allied bombing campaign in Kosovo as ``a mission
of human rights and trying to preserve human values.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether NATO's chosen strategy of using bombs instead of ground
troops to stop the brutal Serb ``ethnic cleansing'' in Kosovo can
succeed is highly debatable, at least outside the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Milosevic's unilateral ``cease-fire'' last week, and his
dickering over the freedom of three U.S. soldiers who were captured
on the Macedonian border, were signs of weakness rather than
tactical maneuvers for advantage, the allies have given themselves
a daunting task: to stop the Serb attacks against civilians, escort
nearly half a million refugees back to their homes in Kosovo, and
guarantee a lasting peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Many military experts believe it will take ground forces to do
the job, and this presents new complications for NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the risk of completely losing face, it will be necessary to
move to a combined air and ground operation,'' Gen. Maurice
Schmitt, a retired French chief of staff, wrote in the daily Le
Figaro last week. He suggested that it could be done with fewer
than 150,000 allied troops.
</P>
<P>
   But the use of ground troops, with its implications of
casualties, is the most sensitive political question for President
Clinton and other NATO leaders. Led by the United States, NATO
continues to insist that it will only go in after the Serb forces
withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   NATO was conceived 50 years ago to prevent World War III, not to
face down tinpot tyrants in the Balkans. In the age of nuclear
standoff, its credibility was unquestioned, and it won the Cold War
without ever firing a shot.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in taking military action in Europe, NATO has felt bold
enough to do what it could not think of doing in Hungary or
Czechoslovakia or Poland when the Soviet Union intervened. And
Milosevic, for his part, has done what Stalin and his successors
never dared to do, defying allied threats and then allied bombing.
Indeed, he used the bombing as cover for a long-prepared campaign
of military and police brutality against Kosovo Albanian civilians.
</P>
<P>
   So, under their current strategy for preserving their
credibility, the allies will have to show continued stamina and
united resolve to keep punishing the Serb military and police
forces until they give up, a task that could take weeks or even
months.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's foreign ministers will try to demonstrate determination
by gathering in Brussels on Monday, but for some members _
particularly Greece, which has Orthodox religious ties with Serbia,
and Italy, which fears being overwhelmed by Albanian refugees _ it
has not been easy.
</P>
<P>
   The sources of the current bind are not difficult to trace. Even
though credibility has always been NATO's most important asset,
NATO frittered away the credibility of its bombing threat against
Milosevic, menacing him with words so many times over the past year
of violence in Kosovo that in the end he concluded the alliance was
full of hot air.
</P>
<P>
   He was wrong. But NATO was also wrong if it thought Milosevic
would cave in after being hit by a few bombs. Milosevic gambled
that he could create an Albanian-free Kosovo faster than allied
conventional bombing could reduce the military and police forces he
was using to carry out his brutal sweeps. And with 10 days of bad
weather and NATO aircraft less effective than hoped against Serb
tanks and troops, he has come close to winning his gamble.
</P>
<P>
   The allies now hope the tide has begun to turn, but they will
have to do more than fight Milosevic to a draw to show that the
alliance has a credible role for the future.
</P>
<P>
   For the first 40 years of NATO's existence, Article 5 of the
North Atlantic Treaty, signed in Washington on April 4, 1949,
defined the core of the alliance as collective defense against
armed attack. But then the threat of armed attack from Russia
became secondary when communism collapsed; in its place, the
virulent nationalisms of the Balkans and the Caucasus that helped
spark World War I became wildly resurgent.
</P>
<P>
   This produced what the alliance calls ``non-Article 5''
missions, like the peacekeeping force in Bosnia and the air
operation over Kosovo. ``Preserving strategic stability in the
Euro-Atlantic area'' is probably the way the alliance will define
its reason for being in the new strategic concept to be approved in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo has reminded the European allies that when security
problems in their own back yard require a rapid military response,
they need U.S. help. But the United States, as the allies see it,
wavers between wanting to drag them into distant confrontations in
places like Iraq and North Korea, and losing interest in a Europe
that ought to be able to take care of itself.
</P>
<P>
   So they debate over things like how the European allies could
use NATO structures to conduct military operations without the
United States, or how the European Union could build a defense
structure of its own.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a lot of talking about such things in Washington
in two weeks. But none of it will mean much if the allies do not
get things right in Kosovo.

WAR TEACHES NATO WHAT ITS ROLE IS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)

<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ The leaders of NATO have long been planning
a summit meeting in Washington from April 23 to 25 to celebrate the
alliance's first 50 years and chart a new ``strategic concept''
defining its role in European security in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, that role is being defined in practice in
Kosovo, not on paper in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The role right now is that of a bulwark against the consequences
of ethnic instability in Europe's southeastern rim. For that, much
more than Russian nuclear bombs, is today the biggest threat to
European security, as it was a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   And if NATO cannot defeat the effort by President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia to drive the ethnic Albanian population out
of the historic Serbian province of Kosovo, the alliance risks
going the way of the League of Nations and other failed
20th-century attempts to deal with the same ethnic instability.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to stop this tragedy of great dimensions, caused by
somebody who has a name, Slobodan Milosevic,'' said NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana. As a young man during the Cold
War, he opposed Spain's entry into the alliance. Now, still a
socialist who describes himself as a Social Democrat, he defines
the purpose of the allied bombing campaign in Kosovo as ``a mission
of human rights and trying to preserve human values.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether NATO's chosen strategy of using bombs instead of ground
troops to stop the brutal Serb ``ethnic cleansing'' in Kosovo can
succeed is highly debatable, at least outside the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Milosevic's unilateral ``cease-fire'' last week, and his
dickering over the freedom of three U.S. soldiers who were captured
on the Macedonian border, were signs of weakness rather than
tactical maneuvers for advantage, the allies have given themselves
a daunting task: to stop the Serb attacks against civilians, escort
nearly half a million refugees back to their homes in Kosovo, and
guarantee a lasting peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Many military experts believe it will take ground forces to do
the job, and this presents new complications for NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the risk of completely losing face, it will be necessary to
move to a combined air and ground operation,'' Gen. Maurice
Schmitt, a retired French chief of staff, wrote in the daily Le
Figaro last week. He suggested that it could be done with fewer
than 150,000 allied troops.
</P>
<P>
   But the use of ground troops, with its implications of
casualties, is the most sensitive political question for President
Clinton and other NATO leaders. Led by the United States, NATO
continues to insist that it will only go in after the Serb forces
withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   NATO was conceived 50 years ago to prevent World War III, not to
face down tinpot tyrants in the Balkans. In the age of nuclear
standoff, its credibility was unquestioned, and it won the Cold War
without ever firing a shot.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in taking military action in Europe, NATO has felt bold
enough to do what it could not think of doing in Hungary or
Czechoslovakia or Poland when the Soviet Union intervened. And
Milosevic, for his part, has done what Stalin and his successors
never dared to do, defying allied threats and then allied bombing.
Indeed, he used the bombing as cover for a long-prepared campaign
of military and police brutality against Kosovo Albanian civilians.
</P>
<P>
   So, under their current strategy for preserving their
credibility, the allies will have to show continued stamina and
united resolve to keep punishing the Serb military and police
forces until they give up, a task that could take weeks or even
months.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's foreign ministers will try to demonstrate determination
by gathering in Brussels on Monday, but for some members _
particularly Greece, which has Orthodox religious ties with Serbia,
and Italy, which fears being overwhelmed by Albanian refugees _ it
has not been easy.
</P>
<P>
   The sources of the current bind are not difficult to trace. Even
though credibility has always been NATO's most important asset,
NATO frittered away the credibility of its bombing threat against
Milosevic, menacing him with words so many times over the past year
of violence in Kosovo that in the end he concluded the alliance was
full of hot air.
</P>
<P>
   He was wrong. But NATO was also wrong if it thought Milosevic
would cave in after being hit by a few bombs. Milosevic gambled
that he could create an Albanian-free Kosovo faster than allied
conventional bombing could reduce the military and police forces he
was using to carry out his brutal sweeps. And with 10 days of bad
weather and NATO aircraft less effective than hoped against Serb
tanks and troops, he has come close to winning his gamble.
</P>
<P>
   The allies now hope the tide has begun to turn, but they will
have to do more than fight Milosevic to a draw to show that the
alliance has a credible role for the future.
</P>
<P>
   For the first 40 years of NATO's existence, Article 5 of the
North Atlantic Treaty, signed in Washington on April 4, 1949,
defined the core of the alliance as collective defense against
armed attack. But then the threat of armed attack from Russia
became secondary when communism collapsed; in its place, the
virulent nationalisms of the Balkans and the Caucasus that helped
spark World War I became wildly resurgent.
</P>
<P>
   This produced what the alliance calls ``non-Article 5''
missions, like the peacekeeping force in Bosnia and the air
operation over Kosovo. ``Preserving strategic stability in the
Euro-Atlantic area'' is probably the way the alliance will define
its reason for being in the new strategic concept to be approved in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo has reminded the European allies that when security
problems in their own back yard require a rapid military response,
they need U.S. help. But the United States, as the allies see it,
wavers between wanting to drag them into distant confrontations in
places like Iraq and North Korea, and losing interest in a Europe
that ought to be able to take care of itself.
</P>
<P>
   So they debate over things like how the European allies could
use NATO structures to conduct military operations without the
United States, or how the European Union could build a defense
structure of its own.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a lot of talking about such things in Washington
in two weeks. But none of it will mean much if the allies do not
get things right in Kosovo.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Missouri outguns the NRA
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the poobahs of the National Rifle Association are wondering
what that odd thing in their laps is, it is their head. Missouri
voters handed it to them last week, in a referendum that quashed
the NRA's attempt to bring them the joys of concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri outlawed concealed weapons in 1875 when Jesse James and
his lads were marauding the state, which was less charmed up close
by their predations than the myth-makers of outlaw chic were back
East.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA has ramrodded repeals through the Missouri legislature
but has been frustrated by a governor who was having none of it.
Hence the referendum, in which the guns-for-all campaign outspent
opponents 4-to-1 but at the end of which Missourians outvoted the
gunners 52 percent to 48 in a large turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Missourians Against Crime, so-called, is crying foul in a
twisted whine that, boiled down, claims the election was unfair
because nobody important _ guv, newspapers, major pols, law
enforcement officials _ was on its side.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA dropped close to $4 million on this little venture _
dues payers might wish to think about that _ and in truth was not
pitching anything all that extraordinary, at least by current
standards. Not long ago most states forbade concealed weapons, but
the gun lobby has been picking off legislatures one by one.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-one states now permit concealment, and Missourians were
only being asked to join the party. Most, however, failed to see
the appeal in the NRA's proposition that the more guns, the safer;
that the good life lies in turning our public space _ streets,
parks, malls, freeways, ballfields _ into zones of wary mutual
firepower.
</P>
<P>
   The vote reflected poll numbers that go back decades, both in
its overall outcome and its breakdown. City and suburban aginners
outvoted rustics. Perhaps NRA's greatest on-going success is in
convincing the rural and small-town hunting culture that any limits
on any firearms _ indeed, as in this case, any failure to
proliferate firearms _ means the next thing you know, you won't be
allowed to shoot moose, or whatever.
</P>
<P>
   For all its braggadocio and bullying, the NRA has always
chickened out on two crucial points. It has refused to press its
absolutist Second Amendment claims to a definitive Supreme Court
ruling, knowing perfectly well the right to bear arms is
conditional.
</P>
<P>
   And it has dodged plebiscites, a skittishness fully vindicated
by its flop in Missouri. The gun lobby took the risk because it is
stalled in Congress for a change, has suffered some setbacks in
cities and gun sales are stagnant.
</P>
<P>
   But undeterred, the NRA now moves its tent to Denver, for its
annual convention. The city's mayor credits his council's 1993 gun
and crime controls for halving the homicide rate, but an
NRA-sympathetic Republican legislature and governor are moving to
make it easier to carry concealed weapons and to bar local
governments from regulating firearms.
</P>
<P>
   When kids play, it's bang-bang, you're dead. When the NRA plays,
it's somehow bang-bang, you're alive. It's a miracle.

POLITICIAN TURNS FUGITIVE: NOT UNUSUAL IN MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A Mexican governor suddenly runs afoul of the top
authorities. Instead of appearing in court to defend himself, he
goes on the lam. Later, he sends a message from a clandestine
location saying he is being persecuted by aides to the Mexican
president and fears for his life.
</P>
<P>
   Last week that was the news from Mexico _ the story of Mario
Villanueva Madrid, the governor who became a fugitive from drug and
racketeering charges.
</P>
<P>
   But broadly speaking, it's also an old story. It was the story
of Pablo Chapa Bezanilla, the deputy attorney general who went
underground in 1997; and of Gerardo de Prevoisin, the president of
Mexico's largest airline, who fled into hiding three years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The general outlines also fit the story of Mario Ruiz Massieu, a
former drug czar who fled Mexico in 1995, and of Carlos Cabal
Peniche, a bank president who lived clandestinely for four years
before his arrest in Australia in November.
</P>
<P>
   There are so many other such cases that to Mexicans, the public
figure turned fugitive has become something of cliche.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our system, there's a thin line separating public officials
from outlaws, and legality from illegality,'' said Homero Aridjis,
a Mexican poet and head of International PEN, the writers' group.
``Overnight, they can leave behind their prerogatives of power and
turn into fugitives.''
</P>
<P>
   To Americans, the idea of running from justice seems like a bad
one even for common criminals, much less for state governors,
federal prosecutors or top corporate executives. But in Mexico,
most recent cases demonstrate the opposite: Fleeing justice usually
pays off.
</P>
<P>
   With the justice system awash in graft and vulnerable to
political pressure, those who clash with the president and his men
but have enough money to flee usually defend themselves more
effectively from exile or even from underground than from a Mexican
prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like Mario Villanueva who become fugitives are experts
in our authoritarian system,'' said Lorenzo Meyer Cosio, a
historian at Mexico City's Colegio de Mexico. ``They know that if
you confront the president, there is no court or judge or defense
team that can protect you.''
</P>
<P>
   Villanueva, the governor of the Caribbean state of Quintana Roo
who clashed with President Ernesto Zedillo and his associates, fled
into hiding last month. Tuesday, the day after his six-year tenure
ended, an arrest warrant was issued for him. Villanueva faxed
newspapers to decry the ``lynch mob'' atmosphere in which
prosecutors were manufacturing evidence to ``destroy me physically,
psychologically and morally.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Mexicans view former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari,
who left Mexico during a 1995 dispute with Zedillo, as a kind of
fugitive. In exile in Ireland, he has not been charged with any
crime. His brother Raul, however, was convicted in January for the
murder of a rival politician, illustrating how badly trials can go
here for defendants who do not flee; Raul's conviction came despite
multiple contradictions in the government's case and proof of
evidence rigging.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Chapa, the deputy attorney general who in 1997 was
indicted for planting a skeleton to incriminate Raul Salinas in the
murder case, demonstrated the wisdom of going underground.
</P>
<P>
   With police closing in, Chapa fled his home in the trunk of his
car, and later sent a letter to newspapers calling himself a
``refugee in self-defense.'' Chapa was later arrested and jailed in
Spain and extradited. But by then he was well-prepared for legal
skirmishes, and once in Mexico was quickly freed.
</P>
<P>
   Another fugitive who beat the system is Angel Isidoro Rodriguez,
a banker who fled to Spain in 1994 after he was accused of fraud.
The Spanish authorities arrested and jailed him last year, but
after his extradition to Mexico, lawyers quickly obtained his
release, too.
</P>
<P>
   Several fugitives have floated the threat that they could reveal
details of high-level corruption or criminality, and many Mexicans
believe that has helped them in their battles with the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   De Prevoisin, the airline chief who fled into exile when he was
charged with embezzling $72 million in 1994, later accused
Zedillo's party of extorting $8 million from the airline during his
election campaign. De Prevoisin eluded arrest until last year and
is currently fighting extradition from Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Cabal Peniche, a banker and friend of former President
Salinas, fled Mexico in 1994 amid charges that he participated in a
$700 million fraud. Authorities traced him to Australia, where he,
too, is battling extradition. Cabal has also threatened to reveal
details of his donations to Zedillo's campaign, estimated at $4
million. ``I am being persecuted because of the threat that it is
believed I represent to the system,'' he said recently.

LIBYA'S GADHAFI WEARIES OF THE COLD SHOULDER 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Highly placed visitors invited lately to the palatial desert
tent of Col. Moammar Gadhafi sensed in the Libyan leader's
conversation a yearning to be readmitted to the world. Me, a
terrorist? he would plead. Of course, he was always an
unpredictable loner and he did spend decades bankrolling
revolutionaries and guerrilla leaders, especially in Africa. But
why are they _ now often heads of government just as he is _
getting all the invitations to London and Washington while he is
left stranded in the sand?
</P>
<P>
   Arabs, Africans, a procession of international lawyers and U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan have been telling Gadhafi for months
that only he can end his isolation, by turning over for trial two
Libyan intelligence agents accused of masterminding the bombing of
Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988, an attack
that killed 280 people. Last week, running out of hope for any
further concessions from Britain and the United States, Gadhafi
finally agreed to deliver the suspects to a former military base in
the Netherlands, where they will be tried under Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
   Was it Libya's oil-dependent economy, in a tailspin because of
world petroleum prices, that did it? Was it threats from Washington
that things could get worse for Tripoli if there was not a break in
the decadelong standoff? Was it that Gadhafi's options had run out
and that, like Saddam Hussein, he had failed to persuade his Arab
neighbors to defy international law and break sanctions on his
behalf? Or was his search for a new kind of Arab nationalism,
rooted in the 1950s and '60s, hopelessly out of date, rendering him
an irritant as well as an anomaly in the Arab world?
</P>
<P>
   No one explanation seems to suffice, say those who have dealt
with the Libyan leader.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the once-flamboyant Gadhafi _ who spent much of last
year in a wheelchair, on crutches or leaning on a cane after what
he brushed off as broken bones but what his critics suspect may
have been an ambush or attempted assassination _ had to battle his
own secret demons. A quixotic leader who 30 years ago transformed
an Arab monarchy into something he chose to call the Libyan Arab
Jamahiriya, or state of the masses, Gadhafi took a political risk
in turning over two citizens to foreign powers he had spent years
vilifying as enemies of his people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very important step,'' said Hussein Hassouna, the
Arab League's representative at the United Nations. ``It will
change everything in the region.'' Arabs say Gadhafi was aware he
had boxed himself in with his refusal to cooperate in the Lockerbie
case and was being bypassed by developments in the Arab world and
the Mediterranean, where links between North Africa and the
European Union are expanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody said to him, `Once you take that step, it will open
up a lot of potential; you have a lot to gain,''' Hassouna said.
Investors and tourists alike seem poised to pounce on the novelty
of Libya, a Mediterranean nation with historical sites as old as
Phoenicia.
</P>
<P>
   More important than advice, however, were the cover and strong
shoulders to lean on that Arab leaders, Annan and President Nelson
Mandela of South Africa gave Gadhafi. Mandela went to Libya more
than a year ago (to the annoyance of Washington) and honored
Gadhafi with South Africa's highest award for Libya's assistance to
the African National Congress during the long years of apartheid.
With trust established, Mandela was able to play a major role _
later to be joined by President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Crown
Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia _ in persuading Gadhafi to accept
the creative Arab proposal that the two Libyan agents be tried in a
third country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was easier to accede to the urging of Mandela than to be
seen to be surrendering to the United States,'' said Thomas Franck,
director of the Center for International Studies at the New York
University Law School. ``The main task in arranging an outcome like
this is to find a way that one of the most eccentric of leaders can
climb down the tree he's climbed up without appearing to be giving
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Clovis Maksoud, a former representative of the Arab League at
the United Nations and now director of the Center for the Global
South at American University in Washington, said: ``Mandela assumed
a fatherly approach. Mandela said, `He helped us in the past, and
we will help him now.'''
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to suggestions that Gadhafi stalled because he feared a
foreign court he could not control, Franck said the Libyan leader
has been one of the most frequent users of the International Court
of Justice in the Hague, Netherlands (unrelated to the specially
created Scottish panel that will try the Libyans), and has abided
by its rulings _ not a claim that can be made by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Libyans allowed the international court, better known as the
World Court, to adjudicate sea rights in a dispute with Tunisia and
Malta, and also obeyed the court's order to return to Chad a strip
of territory fought over in a long and costly war.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, international sanctions on Libya, though not separate
U.S. restrictions on travel and trade, were suspended as promised.
As a result, Libya is now free _ assuming the suspension becomes
permanent in 90 days _ to reopen airline links with the rest of the
world, upgrade its oil industry, rebuild a decrepit communications
system, construct a railroad and pursue other long-delayed
development projects with the help of foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   Yet people who have dealt with Gadhafi say it was not economic
considerations alone that made a settlement possible. The Libyan
leader is too complex for that.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions on Libya, imposed in 1992 and widened in 1993, bit
into the economy, but not too hard. Unlike Iraq, Libya was able to
continue selling oil and gas, its big money earners, and spend the
money on anything it chose except arms and certain equipment for
the petroleum industry.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was Washington's threat of wider sanctions crucial, since it
was assumed that the Clinton administration would find it hard to
persuade the Security Council to take such a step, given
Washington's growing alienation from the United Nations and a
general wariness there about the long-term wisdom of embargoes,
with their unfortunate side effects on civilians. Moreover, the
United States is deeply involved in Kosovo and monitoring a
critical Israeli election and an unfinished war in Iraq, among
other crises. So Libya has slipped down the scale of policy
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   A need to end his isolation and salvage his place in history may
have been the most important factor to Gadhafi.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has definitely got out of the cage he was in,'' Maksoud
said. ``But it is not a defeat for him or a triumph for the
Americans.''

Investors and tourists alike seem poised to pounce on the novelty
of Libya, a Mediterranean nation with historical sites as old as
Phoenicia.
</P>
<P>
   More important than advice, however, were the cover and strong
shoulders to lean on that Arab leaders, Annan and President Nelson
Mandela of South Africa gave Gadhafi. Mandela went to Libya more
than a year ago (to the annoyance of Washington) and honored
Gadhafi with South Africa's highest award for Libya's assistance to
the African National Congress during the long years of apartheid.
With trust established, Mandela was able to play a major role _
later to be joined by President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Crown
Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia _ in persuading Gadhafi to accept
the creative Arab proposal that the two Libyan agents be tried in a
third country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was easier to accede to the urging of Mandela than to be
seen to be surrendering to the United States,'' said Thomas Franck,
director of the Center for International Studies at the New York
University Law School. ``The main task in arranging an outcome like
this is to find a way that one of the most eccentric of leaders can
climb down the tree he's climbed up without appearing to be giving
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Clovis Maksoud, a former representative of the Arab League at
the United Nations and now director of the Center for the Global
South at American University in Washington, said: ``Mandela assumed
a fatherly approach. Mandela said, `He helped us in the past, and
we will help him now.'''
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to suggestions that Gadhafi stalled because he feared a
foreign court he could not control, Franck said the Libyan leader
has been one of the most frequent users of the International Court
of Justice in the Hague, Netherlands (unrelated to the specially
created Scottish panel that will try the Libyans), and has abided
by its rulings _ not a claim that can be made by Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Libyans allowed the international court, better known as the
World Court, to adjudicate sea rights in a dispute with Tunisia and
Malta, and also obeyed the court's order to return to Chad a strip
of territory fought over in a long and costly war.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, international sanctions on Libya, though not separate
U.S. restrictions on travel and trade, were suspended as promised.
As a result, Libya is now free _ assuming the suspension becomes
permanent in 90 days _ to reopen airline links with the rest of the
world, upgrade its oil industry, rebuild a decrepit communications
system, construct a railroad and pursue other long-delayed
development projects with the help of foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   Yet people who have dealt with Gadhafi say it was not economic
considerations alone that made a settlement possible. The Libyan
leader is too complex for that.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions on Libya, imposed in 1992 and widened in 1993, bit
into the economy, but not too hard. Unlike Iraq, Libya was able to
continue selling oil and gas, its big money earners, and spend the
money on anything it chose except arms and certain equipment for
the petroleum industry.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was Washington's threat of wider sanctions crucial, since it
was assumed that the Clinton administration would find it hard to
persuade the Security Council to take such a step, given
Washington's growing alienation from the United Nations and a
general wariness there about the long-term wisdom of embargoes,
with their unfortunate side effects on civilians. Moreover, the
United States is deeply involved in Kosovo and monitoring a
critical Israeli election and an unfinished war in Iraq, among
other crises. So Libya has slipped down the scale of policy
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   A need to end his isolation and salvage his place in history may
have been the most important factor to Gadhafi.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has definitely got out of the cage he was in,'' Maksoud
said. ``But it is not a defeat for him or a triumph for the
Americans.''

WHAT DID YOU DO IN THE COLD WAR, DADDY AND MOMMY? 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.)  (The Week in Review)

<P>
   How is a man of middle age supposed to feel when he is told,
some three decades after his inglorious stateside military service,
that he played an essential part in the defeat of godless
communism?
</P>
<P>
   How is he supposed to feel upon learning that Congress has, at
long last, recognized his contribution to the national defense with
something called the Cold War Recognition Certificate?
</P>
<P>
   The certificate took its place in the pantheon of military
honors last week, when the Defense Department began accepting
applications. Anyone who served in the armed forces or in one of
several federal government positions between Japan's 1945 surrender
ending World War II and Mikhail Gorbachev's resignation as
president of the Soviet Union at the end of 1991 is eligible to
apply.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., the certificate could
go to as many as 22 million people. It carries no financial
benefits or privileges whatever. But, oh, the glory!
</P>
<P>
   Bearing Defense Secretary William Cohen's signature, the
certificate looks and sounds not unlike an honorable discharge. A
Pentagon spokesman, Army Lt. Col. Tom Begines, said the brass did
not push for the certificate, but allowed that maybe it's not such
a bad idea. Government civilians who fought the good fight but have
no military discharges to show for it (foreign service employees,
Defense Department workers, people in intelligence agencies) might
be pleased to have a certificate, the colonel suggested.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Lazio, Mollie Conkey, said her boss got
the idea a few years ago while talking to the husband of one of his
aides. The man had spent eight years in the Army and knew full well
that victory does not always come on the battlefield, that victory
and glory do not always march in step.
</P>
<P>
   And so language creating the Cold War certificate was tucked
into a military-spending bill for the 1998 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the greatest triumphs of freedom and democracy ended
without so much as a parade or any formal recognition,'' Lazio said
last fall, in remarks timed to coincide the start of CNN's ``Cold
War'' series. ``The time has come to remind the world that the
American victory in bringing the Cold War to an end _ while
avoiding nuclear devastation _ is one of the greatest achievements
in the history of mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   But how is a middle-aged man to feel if he knows, in his heart
of hearts, that he wasn't trying to do much for mankind, that he
was just trying to get his military service out of the way?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps his biggest hardships were, say, the broiling August sun
at Fort Knox, Ky., during basic training, then the winter damp at
Fort Gordon, Ga., where he learned to operate teletypes and code
machines, followed by five-and-a-half years of weekly reserve
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone desiring a certificate can write to Cold War Recognition,
4035 Ridge Top Rd., Fairfax, VA 22030. Information is available on
the Internet at coldwar.army.mil/
</P>
<P>
   Because so many people are eligible and not everyone may covet a
certificate, the Pentagon decided to send them only to people who
ask, Begines said. The operation has been budgeted at $600,000 for
the next fiscal year, with future spending uncertain, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans' groups have been enthusiastic about the certificate,
Begines said, perhaps because veterans _ those who were shot at and
those who weren't _ have memories not just of fear and death, but
of being bored and tired.
</P>
<P>
   And homesick. ``For most of the Cold War, the United States
maintained a force of over 300,000 service people in Europe,
patrolling the borders and skies of our allies,'' Begines said.
They fought a war that lasted four decades _ ``a long twilight
struggle,'' in the words of President John F. Kennedy, who knew
what war was like.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people saved us from a nuclear holocaust,'' said Ms.
Conkey, the congressional aide.
</P>
<P>
   But the middle-aged man in question never went overseas, never
got shot at. If he were given a special commendation, it might
right read like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Whereas he kept a stoic expression while enduring the
profanity of the master sergeant, and whereas he braved the grease
and sweat of countless hours of mess hall duty;
</P>
<P>
   ``And whereas during basic training he handled a rifle pretty
well and managed to throw a real, honest-to-goodness live hand
grenade without blowing up himself or his buddies, and whereas he
performed his clerical duties efficiently and conscientiously
thereafter ...''
</P>
<P>
   This middle-aged man doesn't think he did all that much, not
when he recalls standing amid acres of white crosses in the U.S.
military cemetery overlooking Omaha Beach, not when he remembers a
college classmate who didn't come back from Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Let others who are more deserving get their Cold War Recognition
Certificates. I already have a piece of paper. ``This certificate
is awarded as a testimonial of honest and faithful service,'' it
says. My honorable discharge.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This is the time of year _ just as Americans are
grousing over their tax returns _ when Republicans and their allies
try to stoke the flames of tax rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Come mid-April, they like to re-enact the Boston Tea Party,
America's original tax revolt, or stage mock funerals for the tax
code or toss the thick tomes that contain the nation's tax laws
into trash cans. This year, the National Federation of Independent
Business, a lobbying group for small business, is planning to hand
out aspirin at post offices to last-minute tax filers.
</P>
<P>
   But these stunts seem only to highlight what's missing: the kind
of grass-roots uprising that inspired California's Proposition 13
restrictions on property taxes and swept Ronald Reagan into office
nearly two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   This public quiescence is puzzling to the proponents of tax
relief who think that now more than ever it is the time for
significant tax cutting or an overhaul of the tax code. They point
to the fact that federal tax receipts, which are estimated to reach
$1.8 trillion by the end of the federal fiscal year this October,
will amount to 20.6 percent of the gross domestic product. That is
a level unmatched since World War II. They also argue that the
federal surpluses that began appearing last year after a decade of
deficits make the idea of sweeping tax cuts feasible again.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, however, appear to have turned their political
energies and interests elsewhere. It is not that they would reject
a tax cut. A private poll that the National Republican
Congressional Committee distributed to House Republicans at a
retreat in February found that 67 percent of Americans favored a
tax reduction of 10 percent across the board.
</P>
<P>
   But voters seemed more ambivalent about tax cuts when they were
asked how they wanted the government to use the federal surplus.
Given a list of options, 31 percent of those polled said they
wanted the money devoted to Social Security, 26 percent to reducing
the national debt and only 18 percent to tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans are now telling Americans they don't
have to choose. They argue that the Republican budget plan for the
new fiscal year will protect Social Security funds and still have
money left over for tax cuts that grow to $800 billion over a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts say it is economic expansion that has
decreased the public interest in tax cutting. The unemployment rate
is nearing a 29-year low, and the flush times have left most
Americans with money in their pockets and blunted the
anti-government animus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you have good times it makes it harder for tax cutters
like myself and Republicans to make the case you're being bit in
the wallet,'' said Stephen Moore, an economist with the Cato
Institute, a conservative research center. ``Ronald Reagan wouldn't
have been elected in 1980 with the tax cut proposal if we weren't
in a time of economic crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   But in charting the change in attitudes, it is also instructive
to remember the nature of the 1970s economic crisis. That was when
President Gerald Ford made ``Whip Inflation Now'' his motto. When
Howard Jarvis caught the imaginations of Californians and propelled
Proposition 13 to victory in 1978, double-digit inflation was
pushing taxpayers into higher brackets unaccompanied by any real
increase in income. It was also increasing the assessed values of
their homes _ prompting higher property taxes. The biggest victims
were lower- and middle-income Americans, who could be easily moved
into higher tax brackets.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Reagan's 1981 tax act not only cut taxes, it
indexed tax brackets, adjusting them so that inflation alone would
not push people into higher brackets even if they had seen no real
increase in their income.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the irritants in the tax system, like inflation
pushing people up through brackets, have been taken care of now,''
said Iris Lav, the deputy director of the Center on Budget and
Policy Priorities, a liberal non-profit research group.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, inflation nearly disappeared. And instead of
viewing their home as their most important nest egg, many
middle-class Americans are now relying on investments and 401k
plans _ wealth that is not taxed until the stocks are sold.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the lack of rebellion is that the tax burden
is not shared equally. Because of the deficit reduction plans of
1990 and 1993, the rich are paying a larger share of federal taxes
than before. But the tax burden on the middle class and working
class has decreased. Examining an array of taxes, the Congressional
Budget Office found that the 20 percent of families at the middle
of the nation's income scale earned an average income of $38,400 in
1995 and paid 20.2 percent of that in federal taxes. This year,
this group is projected to earn $45,100 on average and pay 18.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Such tax trends have led Americans to look beyond the present.
``We're in a period now where in a variety of fronts, particularly
education, Social Security and Medicare, Americans actually want
government to do something,'' said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic
pollster. ``They are not willing to sacrifice government's ability
to deal with those problems for the sake of a tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosperity has even caused some Republicans to question the
supply-siders, who still hold enormous intellectual sway in their
party. ``Republicans have always been dominated by supply-siders
who said, `cut taxes' at every possible moment,'' said Rep. Joe
Scarborough, R-Fla. ``The lesson of '95 and '96 has been if you cut
federal spending, the markets respond, interest rates drop and the
economy explodes that way, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what you call that,'' Scarborough said. ``It's
not Keynesian. It's not supply side. Maybe its Greenspan
economics.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, even without a tax rebellion, it is likely that
Congress will enact some kind of tax relief this year. President
Clinton now uses the tax code as his chosen instrument of social
policy instead of direct-spending programs. His budget proposed tax
credits for child and health care amounting to $4.1 billion in tax
reductions in fiscal 2000 and $32.6 billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, who are determined to put new muscle in what has
long been their signature issue, have proposed a modest $15 billion
in tax cuts for 2000 growing to $800 billion over a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``My rule of politics is nobody ever lost an election by cutting
taxes,'' said Moore. ``It's always a good bread-and-butter issue
for the Republican Party.''

   ``Some of the irritants in the tax system, like inflation
pushing people up through brackets, have been taken care of now,''
said Iris Lav, the deputy director of the Center on Budget and
Policy Priorities, a liberal non-profit research group.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, inflation nearly disappeared. And instead of
viewing their home as their most important nest egg, many
middle-class Americans are now relying on investments and 401k
plans _ wealth that is not taxed until the stocks are sold.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the lack of rebellion is that the tax burden
is not shared equally. Because of the deficit reduction plans of
1990 and 1993, the rich are paying a larger share of federal taxes
than before. But the tax burden on the middle class and working
class has decreased. Examining an array of taxes, the Congressional
Budget Office found that the 20 percent of families at the middle
of the nation's income scale earned an average income of $38,400 in
1995 and paid 20.2 percent of that in federal taxes. This year,
this group is projected to earn $45,100 on average and pay 18.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Such tax trends have led Americans to look beyond the present.
``We're in a period now where in a variety of fronts, particularly
education, Social Security and Medicare, Americans actually want
government to do something,'' said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic
pollster. ``They are not willing to sacrifice government's ability
to deal with those problems for the sake of a tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosperity has even caused some Republicans to question the
supply-siders, who still hold enormous intellectual sway in their
party. ``Republicans have always been dominated by supply-siders
who said, `cut taxes' at every possible moment,'' said Rep. Joe
Scarborough, R-Fla. ``The lesson of '95 and '96 has been if you cut
federal spending, the markets respond, interest rates drop and the
economy explodes that way, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what you call that,'' Scarborough said. ``It's
not Keynesian. It's not supply side. Maybe its Greenspan
economics.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, even without a tax rebellion, it is likely that
Congress will enact some kind of tax relief this year. President
Clinton now uses the tax code as his chosen instrument of social
policy instead of direct-spending programs. His budget proposed tax
credits for child and health care amounting to $4.1 billion in tax
reductions in fiscal 2000 and $32.6 billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, who are determined to put new muscle in what has
long been their signature issue, have proposed a modest $15 billion
in tax cuts for 2000 growing to $800 billion over a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``My rule of politics is nobody ever lost an election by cutting
taxes,'' said Moore. ``It's always a good bread-and-butter issue
for the Republican Party.''

   WASHINGTON _ Meeting in February to review interest rate policy,
members of the Federal Reserve fretted, as they always do, about
the possible resurgence of inflation. But their discussion soon
turned to whether the central bank's system of spotting incipient
wage and price pressures might be malfunctioning.
</P>
<P>
   This early-warning system _ built around interrelationships
between unemployment, growth and inflation _ assumes that when
joblessness falls below a certain ``natural'' level, prices will
rise. As a forecasting and policy-making tool, the framework
provided a reasonably accurate way of knowing when inflation would
strike and enabling the Fed to head it off by adjusting monetary
policy. At least until the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment has been falling for seven years, and in March it
dipped to 4.2 percent, its lowest level in nearly three decades and
well below any mainstream estimate of the natural unemployment
rate. Economic growth, while slowing somewhat, remains robust. Yet
the predicted inflation is nowhere to be found. And although
theoretical economists have been debating the issue of a natural
rate for years, concern about the concept's reliability now are
beginning to change the way the Fed thinks about inflation and sets
policy.
</P>
<P>
   The sketchy minutes of the central bank's February meeting _ the
only account made public _ suggest that even Fed officials are
struggling to find answers. The combination ``over an extended
period of strong economic growth, very low rates of unemployment,
and the absence of any buildup of inflation could not be explained
in terms of normal historical relationships,'' the minutes said.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Fed officials, according to the minutes, ``suggested
that the inflation process was not well understood and that
inflation forecasts were subject to a wide range of uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed does not understand the inflation process? It is like a
conference of top cardiac surgeons deciding that it did not really
know how the heart works, or NASA admitting that it was not sure
what happens when the countdown reaches zero.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists believe that since the Fed has less confidence
in its ability to predict inflation, it will be less likely to act
pre-emptively against inflation _ its strategy through much of the
last several decades _ and more likely to wait for evidence that
wage and price increases are actually accelerating.
</P>
<P>
   The natural-rate theory, which is encompassed in such arcane
concepts as the Phillips Curve and the non-accelerating inflation
rate of unemployment, still has its advocates, including some Fed
officials. Even skeptics acknowledge that there is a long-term
tradeoff between unemployment and inflation. The question is
whether the tradeoffs are consistent enough in a rapidly changing
economy to be of any use in predicting inflation and setting
interest rates at the appropriate level.
</P>
<P>
   ``These various road maps or rules that we use are valid at
times,'' said L. Douglas Lee, chief economist at HSBC Securities.
``But what you always have to remember is that the U.S. economy is
a very dynamic creature and things don't remain fixed. What works
at one point in terms of understanding inflation may not work at
another, but then may change and work again.''
</P>
<P>
   The trick for policy-makers, Lee said, is to remain flexible and
to recognize when their old assumptions are no longer working _
something that he and many other economists credit Fed Chairman
Alan Greenspan with doing well in the last few years. Greenspan has
consistently resisted pressure to raise rates over the past few
years just because the old models have been sending warnings
signals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Policy-makers have to keep on top of what's going on, so they
don't use the old road map on a new road,'' Lee said. ``We've hd
quite a lengthy period of time now where the economy has grown
faster and inflation has been less than the Fed's forecast
expected. The longer the economy surprises you, the more you have
to question your fundamental assumptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists have offered a raft of explanations for the apparent
breakdown in the old relationships between employment, growth and
inflation, some suggesting that the change is temporary, others
seeing it as emblematic of a fundamental shift in the way the
economy works.
</P>
<P>
   Those in the fundamental change camp, which includes an
increasing number of Fed officials, say that inflation is being
dampened by improved productivity in American business. Faced with
a shortage of labor, employers are paying somewhat higher wages.
But because of intense competition, at home and abroad, they are
unable to pass on the higher costs to consumers. So they are
investing heavily in computers and other cost-saving equipment, and
re-examining the way they operate to reduce expenses at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   Although the statistics are fuzzy, economists increasingly
believe that the result has been the first lasting improvement in
productivity _ output per worker _ since it inexplicably turned
down in the early 1970s. Higher productivity means the economy can
sustain higher rates of non-inflationary growth.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship of inflation to unemployment, Greenspan told
Congress earlier this year, ``is clearly a far more complex
process'' than implied by the natural-rate concept. ``At some
point,'' he said, ``the general notion that a different type of
process is involved here is going to probably gain, in my judgment,
a majority view among economists.''

FOR A REPORTER AND A SOURCE, ECHOES OF BROKEN PROMISE

   CINCINNATI _ Faced with a long prison term and financial ruin,
Michael Gallagher did what criminals routinely do in such
circumstances: He cut a deal with prosecutors, swapping
incriminating information against someone else for leniency and a
lighter sentence.
</P>
<P>
   But Gallagher was not just another white-collar miscreant or
small-time hoodlum. He was an investigative reporter who had worked
for Cincinnati's dominant newspaper, The Enquirer. His decision to
reveal the name of a confidential source, along with notes,
documents and secretly taped conversations, is echoing through the
legal and journalistic communities as a major assault on the
revered principle of protecting sources. And the case is raising
questions about the legal rights of sources who are burned by
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Most legal precedents on this subject involve efforts to protect
confidential sources in the face of attempts by prosecutors or
others to force disclosure of their names. Indeed, it is something
of a badge of honor among journalists to go to jail _ or promise to
_ rather than identify a source.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher had promised his source, George Ventura, a former
lawyer for Chiquita Brands International, that he would go to jail
rather than reveal that Ventura had helped him gain access to
Chiquita's voice-mail system, according to evidence disclosed last
week. But in the end, Gallagher struck a deal with prosecutors and
identified Ventura. Now it is Ventura who faces the prospect of
going to jail. He is charged with violations of Ohio's electronic
communication privacy law and unauthorized access to a computer. If
convicted, could be sentenced to as much as 12{ years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Kovach, curator of the Nieman Foundation at Harvard
University, said Gallagher's actions were unfortunate for all
journalists. ``In throwing over a source, he has given up the right
to ever claim to be a journalist,'' Kovach said. ``His integrity
was on the line and he surrendered it. It hurts the stature of
journalism all around to have someone behave publicly the way
Gallagher has behaved.''
</P>
<P>
   That view was echoed by Jane Kirtley, the executive director of
the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. ``I've dealt with
reporters who would _ and do _ go to jail to protect sources, so
this is a very painful case,'' Ms. Kirtley said. ``It smacks of
saving your own hide by letting your source take the
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   The rationale for protecting sources is straightforward: Often
the only way to obtain information about criminal wrongdoing,
corporate mismanagement or public corruption is by promising
anonymity to someone who has information about those matters.
</P>
<P>
   In an affidavit filed in the Cincinnati case, Sandra Davidson, a
journalism professor at the University of Missouri, said that if a
reporter does not keep a promise of confidentiality, sources will
dry up and so will the flow of information. ``That chilling effect,
however, will not stop at that particular journalist, but will also
affect the ability of the journalist's colleagues to gather
information,'' she said. ``If the sources of information dry up,
then the functioning of the whole system collapses.''
</P>
<P>
   The initial contact between The Enquirer and Ventura had come in
early October of 1997, several months after Gallagher and another
reporter, Cameron McWhirter, had begun work on the Chiquita
project. Ventura, who had left Chiquita a year earlier, sent an
e-mail message to McWhirter offering to help with the story,
according to testimony and statements in court by Daniel Breyer, a
special prosecutor for Hamilton County.
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, in a taped telephone conversation with
McWhirter, Ventura said, ``You've got to have someone run through
those voice mails,'' according to Breyer. In the same conversation,
Ventura provided secret access codes for the voice mails of at
least two Chiquita lawyers, the prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, the Enquirer published an 18-page special section
challenging the business practices of Chiquita, the huge banana
company based in Cincinnati. But less than two months later, the
newspaper, owned by Gannett Co., published a front-page apology,
agreed to pay Chiquita more than $10 million and fired Gallagher,
its star investigative reporter, saying he had misled his editors.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-September, Gallagher had reached a bargain with the
special prosecutor in which he pleaded guilty to two felonies,
carrying a total sentence of up to 2{ years in prison. To avoid
more extensive charges, he told prosecutors that Ventura had
provided him with access codes to the Chiquita voice-mail system
and agreed to testify against his former source.
</P>
<P>
   McWhirter, who has never identified Ventura or anyone else as a
source, testified that in October 1997 he had passed the voice-mail
access codes on to Gallagher, who quickly used them to gain access
to the voice-mail system 15 to 20 times before being informed by
his editors and lawyers for the newspaper that what he was doing
was probably illegal.
</P>
<P>
   But Gallagher continued to tap into the voice-mail system
without his editors' knowledge, according to his testimony last
week. Gallagher said he believed protecting the identity of a
source is ``one of the highest responsibilities a journalist has.''
He offered no explanation for disclosing Ventura's assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Like many confidential sources, Ventura was a disgruntled former
employee. In an interview last week, he said he had been angered by
Chiquita's treatment of some of its employees while he was working
for the company in Honduras, and that he had quit partly in
protest. But it was also disclosed in court by Breyer that Ventura
had demanded $1.5 million from Chiquita, and had threatened to file
a discrimination complaint and go to the press.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Breyer said, Ventura was suspected of being a
source for the articles even before Gallagher revealed his
identity. Nonetheless, Ventura was not indicted until after the
reporter agreed to cooperate and confirmed Ventura's role to
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   In defending himself against the 10-count indictment returned by
a county grand jury last September, Ventura has taken the unusual
step of invoking Ohio's shield law. He claims that the protection
afforded journalists who refuse to reveal sources should also apply
to the sources. The judge in the case, Ann Marie Tracey, has not
yet ruled on the shield law question. It is an issue for which
there are few legal precedents and little agreement among
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   The law must not only shield the journalist from having to
reveal his or her source,'' said Ms. Davidson, ``but the law must
also shield the source from having his or her identity revealed by
the journalist.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Kirtley sees a danger in extending the protections.
``Allowing a source to use the shield law as a sword to control the
reporter would signal yet another attempt to erode the intent of
shield laws, which is to protect a journalist,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Gallagher, he faces a maximum sentence of 2{ years,
having pleaded guilty to two of what might have been hundreds of
counts. He also faces a civil suit brought by Chiquita. And,
judging from the questions asked in court last week by Ventura's
lawyer, Marc Mezibov, both Gallagher and the Enquirer face the
likelihood of a civil suit by Ventura for breach of contract in
divulging his identity.

his editors and lawyers for the newspaper that what he was doing
was probably illegal.
</P>
<P>
   But Gallagher continued to tap into the voice-mail system
without his editors' knowledge, according to his testimony last
week. Gallagher said he believed protecting the identity of a
source is ``one of the highest responsibilities a journalist has.''
He offered no explanation for disclosing Ventura's assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Like many confidential sources, Ventura was a disgruntled former
employee. In an interview last week, he said he had been angered by
Chiquita's treatment of some of its employees while he was working
for the company in Honduras, and that he had quit partly in
protest. But it was also disclosed in court by Breyer that Ventura
had demanded $1.5 million from Chiquita, and had threatened to file
a discrimination complaint and go to the press.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Breyer said, Ventura was suspected of being a
source for the articles even before Gallagher revealed his
identity. Nonetheless, Ventura was not indicted until after the
reporter agreed to cooperate and confirmed Ventura's role to
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   In defending himself against the 10-count indictment returned by
a county grand jury last September, Ventura has taken the unusual
step of invoking Ohio's shield law. He claims that the protection
afforded journalists who refuse to reveal sources should also apply
to the sources. The judge in the case, Ann Marie Tracey, has not
yet ruled on the shield law question. It is an issue for which
there are few legal precedents and little agreement among
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   The law must not only shield the journalist from having to
reveal his or her source,'' said Ms. Davidson, ``but the law must
also shield the source from having his or her identity revealed by
the journalist.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Kirtley sees a danger in extending the protections.
``Allowing a source to use the shield law as a sword to control the
reporter would signal yet another attempt to erode the intent of
shield laws, which is to protect a journalist,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Gallagher, he faces a maximum sentence of 2{ years,
having pleaded guilty to two of what might have been hundreds of
counts. He also faces a civil suit brought by Chiquita. And,
judging from the questions asked in court last week by Ventura's
lawyer, Marc Mezibov, both Gallagher and the Enquirer face the
likelihood of a civil suit by Ventura for breach of contract in
divulging his identity.

WOULD-BE SOLDIERS HEAD TO JOIN KLA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ Almost four dozen men, some dressed in
camouflage fatigues, arrived in darkness, saying they had traveled
from Germany to join the Kosovo Liberation Army's fight against
Serbian troops.
</P>
<P>
   The men appeared to be unarmed and exhausted. One said they had
been on the road since Thursday, when they left Nuremburg in a
caravan of buses.
</P>
<P>
   All were ethnic Albanians who had fled to Germany from Kosovo in
the past two years, but who had decided it was their duty to
bolster the besieged rebel troops, according to one member of the
group. He would not identify himself except to say that he is 38
years old and that his first name is Hisen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are tired,'' he said shortly before 3 a.m. in the apartment
of a resident of Kukes, about 30 minutes from the border. ``But we
are ready to fight right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the backgrounds of the 47 men nor their mission in the
mountains of northern Albania could be independently verified, and
nearly all of them declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   But their arrival bolstered reports that Kosovars living in
Western Europe _ and even some foreigners _ have been coming into
the region over the past week, as accounts of atrocities committed
by Yugoslav forces have increased and as Kosovo Liberation Army
officials have acknowledged that they are in dire need of help.
</P>
<P>
   Hisen said a group of 90 ethnic Albanians living in Switzerland
is on its way to help, too, along with dozens of Kosovars who had
fled to Slovenia and Austria.
</P>
<P>
   In another indication that would-be reinforcements are arriving,
a Kosovo Liberation Army guard in uniform was seen at a checkpoint
near the border Sunday, greeting a family from Macedonia reportedly
coming to visit relatives who had recently joined the rebels. The
guard, Refki Cenaj, 27, said 1,200 soldiers from abroad are
expected to arrive in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here from Kosovo,'' Cenaj said. ``I picked up a group
to train. We'll go back in groups of 30 or 40.''
</P>
<P>
   Ilaz Ramajli, a spokesman for Kosovars in the capital city of
Tirana, said he had been told of men arriving from ``around the
world'' to join the Kosovo Liberation Army. But he added that their
efforts would be meaningless without the help of NATO ground
troops, an assessment Kosovar leaders made a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the addition of untrained ground forces otherwise could
affect the fight against the Serbs remains in great doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are signs that NATO's bombing is taking its toll
on the Serb troops _ who reportedly are starting a campaign inside
Kosovo to recruit ethnic Albanian men _ the Kosovo Liberation Army
has always been badly outmuscled in weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has consistently declined to give direct support to the
rebels, whose tactics frequently include terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The US policy has basically been to let the rebels wage an
independent campaign, though a bill is pending in Congress to
supply the Kosovo Liberation Army with arms and President Clinton
has hinted that Washington might eventually support an independent
Kosovo if Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic does not
capitulate.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the United States were to assist the Kosovar force, its
structure is so disorganized that it is often hard to know who is
in charge. Ibrahim Rugova, the elected leader of Kosovo for nearly
a decade, is apparently under house arrest in Belgrade but has long
been considered ineffective anyway. His de facto successor is
Hashim Thaci, a KLA official who has reportedly been in hiding
outside the province for months.
</P>
<P>
   The network of KLA soldiers also appears to be haphazard.
Truckloads of them tear up and down the disintegrating roads in the
region, with Kalishnikov rifles slung across their backs, and their
destination and purpose unclear.
</P>
<P>
   The new arrivals were unsure of how they would operate. After
arranging their itinerary in Nuremburg, Hasen said, the group
departed April 8 without making any contact with Kosovo Liberation
Army leaders.
</P>
<P>
   He said they drove through Austria to Italy, where they caught
the ferry to the western coast of Albania.
</P>
<P>
   They then drove eight hours and arrived at 2 a.m. Sunday in
Kukes, where Hassen said they contacted a Kosovar commander to
discuss arrangements for going to a training camp.
</P>
<P>
   They expected 10 to 15 days of training before being sent over
the border into Kosovo. ``We hope in terms of winning the war that
the US and NATO will supply us weapons,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is needed, '' added Hisen, who said he is
originally from Mitrovica, where he worked in a bus agency until
fleeing to Germany two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Serb troops inside Kosovo are apparently trying to
lure young ethnic Albanian men away from the Kosovo Liberation
Army, according to refugees who arrived from the province Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Sabit Bullatovci, 48, an engineer from a nearby town, said three
Serb military officers came to his house at 8:30 p.m. last Friday
and asked him to find 500 volunteers. The Serbs said they would
``give us weapons and armaments to fight NATO and then we would be
safe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said if we didn't join, we had to leave the house the
next day at 8 a.m. If not, they would kill everybody,'' Bullatovci
said. He said he immediately rejected their request, and the men
pushed him no further.
</P>
<P>
   Bullatovci said he believed the request was a ploy by Milosevic
to pit ethnic Albanians against ethnic Albanians, and to deliver
young Kosovars to their deaths more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we provided the men, they would be killed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 young men crossing the border the previous night
said they had also been approached by Serbs looking for ethnic
Albanian recruits. All said they had quickly refused, and said they
also assumed the question was a trick.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Needed: One more volume from an aging Marine
 &HT;    For release Wednesday, April 14, 1999.

<P>
   When last we left Winston Churchill, in the late spring and
early summer of 1940, he had just assumed the role of Prime
Minister of Great Britain, the Germans were racing through Holland
and Belgium, France was being humiliated in the field and Adolf
Hitler's bombers were lambasting England.
</P>
<P>
   So, what happened after that?
</P>
<P>
   It has been 11 years since Volume 2 of William Manchester's
exceptional biography of the British wartime leader was published
and those of us anxious to read the continuation are parched.
</P>
<P>
   This is particularly noteworthy now as some end-of-the-century
retrospectives refer to Churchill as the greatest person of these
past 100 years. Add to that the release this month of a book of
letters Churchill wrote to his wife, ``Winston and Clementine: The
Personal Letters of the Churchills'', and Churchill aficionados are
stirred, now more anxious for Volume 3.
</P>
<P>
   For the longest time, I have been trying to find out where
Manchester is in Volume 3 but neither his publisher, Little, Brown
&AMP; Company, nor Manchester himself is responsive to my queries,
other than to say he's working on the book.
</P>
<P>
   Manchester's first of ``The Last Lion'' series, based on
Churchill's early years (1874-1932) was published in 1984. Five
years later, the second installment was released, bringing
Churchill up to the late spring of 1940.
</P>
<P>
   It was at the conclusion of that volume that Churchill's
predilection to greatness began to emerge. Several days after he
replaced Neville Chamberlain as prime minister, Churchill addressed
the British public via radio. It was during that June 19, 1940
broadcast that Churchill spoke some of the stirring words for which
he is so fondly remembered:
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties, and so bear
ourselves that if the British Empire and its Commonwealth last for
a thousand years, Men will still say: 'This was their finest hour.'
``
</P>
<P>
   It may have been Manchester's finest hour as well. The writing
(and research) of his first two volumes were outstanding. His
perspective was exceptional, such as this sentence just after the
French sued for peace with the Nazis while the British dug in their
claws.
</P>
<P>
   ``The British were prepared to sacrifice London house by house,
to be destroyed rather than be dishonored. The French loved honor,
but loved Paris more, as they would demonstrate before summer
arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   A newspaper writer joined a group of Manchester's former World
War II Marine Corps buddies at the author's Connecticut home last
October. They reminisced about their days fighting the Japanese on
Guadalcanal and Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manchester is down,'' Paul Reid of the Palm Beach Post
observed of the 77-year-old author. ``He's thin as a nail and just
as tough, but still a little bent at the waist and low in the
shoulder, as if one blow too many fell his way.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, he's aging _ as do us all, but we all didn't go
through the South Pacific with a rifle and bayonet; guys who did
can age quicker.
</P>
<P>
   Letters to Manchester about where he is on Volume 3 go
unanswered, someone at Little, Brown responds to my queries with
the stock answer that Manchester is working on the book and to stay
tuned to future announcements. But none have come since I began
inquiring about the status of Volume 3 last August.
</P>
<P>
   After his October session with Manchester, reporter Reid
commented that Manchester has ``a couple of hundred pages done and
a mountain of notes to collate.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some of us who wonder if Volume 3 of ``The Young
Lion'' ever will be completed by Manchester, and it will be a pity
if it isn't. No one can match the perception and ability of
Manchester's writings. We found that out similarly when successors
tried to complete Ernest Hemingway manuscripts. They just weren't
Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Manchester doesn't feel he owes the world anything; but,
we do _ at least one more volume about that man Churchill.

READING THE TINY PRINT CAN BE HAZARDOUS TO YOUR HEALTH

 c. 1999 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As I was working on my taxes the other day _ mumbling things
like ``Deduct THIS, Uncle Sam'' _ I took a break, picked up a
magazine and began flipping pages. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because I already was into a fine-print mode, when I hit one of
those astonishingly weird ads for some kind of prescription drug I
stopped. In this case, the tablets being pushed were to help lower
cholesterol levels. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (I've been working on keeping my cholesterol down without drugs
ever since I discovered a few years ago that my count was exactly
equal to Dan Quayle's, and I wished to share nothing in common with
him if I could help it.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ad I was reading took up four pages. The first two were your
standard glitzy come-on, featuring graphs and testimonials from
people taking the stuff. But the next two were in teeny-weeny print
that most of us couldn't read without a digitally enhanced
electronic microscope. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the newspaper business we call tiny type ``agate,'' but real
agate looks like a 72-point headline next to the print in this
magazine ad. (By the way, a Food and Drug Administration
spokesperson tell me the FDA requires pharmaceutical companies to
print all this stuff in ads for prescription drugs. The firms don't
do it just to use up their ad budget or to weaken your eyes so
you'll buy their vision-enhancing drugs, if any.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Who reads this stuff?'' I asked myself. And, being a pretty
fair conversationalist, I answered, ``Why are you asking me? I have
no idea.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I try not to ignore me when I talk to myself. My parents taught
me good manners and, though they're gone now, they would be proud
to know I continue to answer myself when I hear me address myself. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, I thought, I'll see if I can make out any of the words
here. So I rented a digitally enhanced electronic microscope and
began staring at the itsy-bitsy words. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, push me in a puddle and call me a swimmer. Friends, you
really don't want to get into this stuff. It's enough to make your
knees hollow. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first three words I made out were ``nursing rat pups.'' I
didn't even know that's what you call baby rats. Never needed to
know. Never wanted to know. Am sorry I know now. Will try to
forget. Several more hours of squinting finally made clear that
this sentence had to do with a recommendation to mothers who
breast-feed not to take this stuff. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It got worse. The next words to achieve clarity were: ``Brain
hemorrhage and optic nerve vacuolation were seen in another female
dog that was sacrificed in moribund condition after 11 weeks of
escalating doses. . .'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Which reminds me of something I forgot to tell you at the start
_ up there where I was snarling at Uncle Sam: No animals died in
the production of this column. Which, apparently, is more than I
can say for the production of the drug I was reading about. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rats and dogs, however, weren't the only animals in the small
print. There were also ``Chinese hamster lung cells.'' Look. I'm
not against using animals in test labs when necessary to save human
life. I know which is more important. But that doesn't mean I want
to have the animals or their parts named and described for me. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Next I hit discussion of ``severe congenital bony deformity,
tracheo-esophageal fistula and anal atresia,'' and I quit. I felt
weak. I sensed my cholesterol had slipped dangerously low. I
grabbed some fried chicken and cheesecake and went back to my
taxes. Maybe Uncle Sam really needs my money, I thought. Maybe the
poor devil is on this cholesterol-lowering drug. &QL;

THERE'S GREAT DANGER IN RAISING THE FLAG SO HIGH

<P>
   The ``Flag Uber Alles'' boys are at it again. They want to raise
the American flag above the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of
Rights. In doing so they raise it to the level of idolatry.
</P>
<P>
   Members of both houses of Congress have introduced amendments to
the Constitution ``authorizing Congress to prohibit the physical
desecration of the flag of the United States.'' On Feb. 24, Reps.
Randy Cunningham, R-Calif., and John Murtha, D-Penn., introduced
House Joint Resolution 33. And on March 17, Sen. Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah, introduced a similar measure, Senate Joint Resolution 14.
</P>
<P>
   Those who support the flag desecration amendment say it doesn't
violate the First Amendment's protection of political dissent. Flag
burning, they contend, isn't speech.
</P>
<P>
   Funny isn't it, these same folks got the message back in 1984
when Gregory Lee Johnson doused an American flag with kerosene and
set it on fire? He did so in front of city hall in Dallas during
the Republican National Convention. Texas charged Johnson with
desecration of a venerated object and sentenced him to one year in
prison. He won at the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals and later
(1989) at the U.S. Supreme Court, by a narrow majority.
</P>
<P>
   Funny isn't it, that flag etiquette provides for burning a
tattered or soiled flag. So how do these flag amendment folks
distinguish a desecration from veneration? By context, of course.
And the message is extremely, if offensively, clear when flag
burning is political protest.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court is nearly unanimous in accepting that flag
burning in certain contexts expresses a message of dissent. Justice
William Brennan who wrote for the majority in Texas vs. Johnson,
stated, ``If there is a bedrock of principle underlying the First
Amendment, it is that the government may not prohibit the
expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself
offensive or disagreeable.''
</P>
<P>
   Brennan ended the opinion: ``Our decision is a reaffirmation of
the principles of freedom and inclusiveness that the flag best
reflects, and of the conviction that our tolerance of criticism
such as Johnson's is a sign and source of our strength ... The way
to preserve the flag's special role is not to punish those who feel
differently about these matters. It is to persuade them that they
are wrong.'' He ends this paragraph: ``We do not consecrate the
flag by punishing its desecration, for in doing so we dilute the
freedom that this cherished emblem represents.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Warner, a veteran of the Vietnam War who received the
Silver Star and two Purple Hearts, was imprisoned by the North
Vietnamese from 1967 to 1973. He is quoted by Nat Hentoff in his
book ``Free Speech for Me - But Not for Thee'' telling about his
captives. His words give specificity to Brennan's more general
truth, ``our tolerance of criticism ... is a sign and source of our
strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner said, ``I remember one interrogation where I was shown a
photograph of some Americans protesting the war by burning the
flag. `There,' the officer said. `People in your country protest
against your cause. That proves you are wrong.'''
</P>
<P>
   Warner countered, ``No. That proves that I am right. In my
country, we are not afraid of freedom, even if it means that people
disagree with us.'' Warner went on to say, ``The officer was on his
feet in an instant, his face purple with rage. He smashed his fist
onto the table and screamed at me to shut up. While he was ranting,
I was astonished to see pain, compounded by fear, in his eyes. I
have never forgotten that look, nor have I forgotten the
satisfaction I felt at using his tool, the picture of the burning
flag, against him.''
</P>
<P>
   A nation that uses force to compel unity and patriotism, is a
nation on its way to a dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   These Flag Uber Alles advocates raise the flag above the very
liberties it represents. No nation has protected political dissent
more than the United States -- yet this amendment would strangle
some forms of political protest. We are a nation born of a
revolution, our founders understood all forms of political protest
must be protected. That was the intent of the First Amendment's all
encompassing protection: ``Congress shall make no law abridging ...
the freedom of speech.''
</P>
<P>
   If the flag is raised so high so that it is sacred compared to
the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, there is the danger that
it becomes a graven image, akin to a religious idol.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't against the law to burn a cross or any other religious
symbol _ yet it would be against the law to burn a flag, if these
flag amendment folks have their way. The implication here is that
the flag is more important (More sacred?) than any religious
symbol. Many will find that notion offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Congress should drop this phony pretence at patriotism and get
down to the important work that the people sent them to Washington,
D.C. to accomplish _ solving the problems of Social Security and
universal medical care. Grappling and dealing with those real
problems should be patriotism enough for any politician.

 &HT;    While some cities balk, Atlanta plans to party
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After many months of trying to drum up interest in a
huge downtown New Year's Eve bash in Atlanta, planners now say the
merrymaking is coming together. A tighter-than-hoped-for budget,
though, will reduce the street party from its original schedule of
Thanksgiving through Jan. 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've shrunk the promotional time but saved the main events,''
said John Bevilaqua, president of Creative Marketing Strategies
Inc., the event-planning company spearheading the effort. The plans
are shaping up this month because ``the clock is ticking. ...
There's a sense of urgency now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But ironically, just as Atlanta's party plans are jelling, some
communities are starting to downscale or even cancel celebrations
due to lack of interest, funding difficulties or concerns about
computer bugs biting at midnight. For example, Party 2000, a
five-day concert and party that organizers had planned to hold on
5,000 acres in Southern California, appears headed toward a
figurative Death Valley. The organizers' Internet site recently
announced that ``owners of Party 2000 have decided to literally
give the production away to any person or company (with) the
financial resources'' to pull it off. So far, no takers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, The Associated Press is reporting that island nations
near the international dateline, such as Fiji and Tonga, are
scaling back expectations for revelry. Though hotels will be booked
as they always are during the week between Christmas and New
Year's, plans for using big tents to accommodate millions of
visitors have evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Paul, Minn., the organizers of that city's big party are
changing the celebration date to Dec. 30. Obviously, that will make
the midnight countdown a tad less exciting, but at least the crowds
won't have to worry about Y2K, the computer bug that threatens to
disrupt some equipment when the date changes. St. Paul officials
say they don't expect any serious Y2K problems but moved up the
celebration date in part because they fear potential partiers may
stay home Dec. 31 just in case of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But Bevilaqua says he has no Y2K concerns. ``We talked to
Georgia Power, and they aren't worried'' because fixes have been
made, he said. Besides, the event will take place outside where no
one will have to ride an elevator or fly in an airplane, so not
many things can go wrong, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bevilaqua says he has raised more than $3 million in pledges
from corporate sponsors for the event, to be called the ``Carnivale
of Lights.'' With the encouragement of the Atlanta Convention and
Visitors Bureau and the city, Bevilaqua has developed an outline
for a party involving fireworks, illuminated parade floats, lasers
and other lights.
</P>
<P>
   The plan now calls for a Dec. 18th kickoff. At that time,
downtown and Midtown will be lighted by ``lasers, high-tech image
and film-projection systems, building wash lighting, automated
xenon search lighting and many additional, high-impact lighting
systems,'' according to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   On New Year's Eve, an illuminated parade of colorful floats will
wind down Peachtree Street from Midtown to downtown and then over
to Freedom Park, not far from the Civic Center MARTA station.
Belivaqua says he expects 500,000 to 700,000 people to gather there
for music and other entertainment. At midnight, a laser and
fireworks show will light up buildings and the sky over downtown
and Midtown.
</P>
<P>
   Bevilaqua said that when he started trying to pull together this
event, there was ``a lot of confusion'' over what would be
sanctioned by the city and supported by corporate sponsors. But at
this point, ``we're all joining hands and going forward,'' he said.
The final plans and list of sponsors will be announced about May 1,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   So let others scale back or fret about computer bugs. In
Atlanta, the party is just getting started.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Our heartbeats interwoven in life, death
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Spring always makes me acutely aware of life's
rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   All around us, nature is vigorously awaking. Trees are leafing,
tulips and jonquils are blooming, calves are frolicking and nests
are filling with the constant peeping of new life.
</P>
<P>
   But the rhythms of life also include death. Three of my friends
recently lost a parent. It wasn't unexpected, given their advanced
ages and medical conditions; and yet, in our society it seems death
is always unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   For these friends, all close to my own age, it was the first
parent they'd lost. It's an emotional blow that signals a new life
stage for which we're rarely prepared. How do we grasp that those
who gave us life now are dead?
</P>
<P>
   On a recent weekend, we went to visit the newest member of our
extended family, a month-old great-nephew. As his parents sat
beaming on the couch, we held this new life and marveled at his
beauty and perfection.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny fingers and toes, a mouth no bigger than a button, dark
blue eyes gazing everywhere and seeing nothing clearly _ he
embodied the miraculous in every molecule of his being.
</P>
<P>
   His 2-year-old sister bent to kiss his downy head, as instructed
by parents, and then scampered off to play peek-a-boo under the
coffee table.
</P>
<P>
   New beginnings were popping up in that house like mushrooms
after a spring rain.
</P>
<P>
   As I held this promise of new life, however, my mind was
somewhere else _ on my brother in California, who at that very
moment was undergoing triple bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
   In my arms, this newborn's tiny heart beat strongly and quickly,
ready to take him miles into the future. Far away, another heart
was beating only through the miracle of modern medicine, with no
guarantees on how many more miles it would take its owner. In yet
another part of the country, another heart _ our mother's _ beat
much more slowly in a steady, vigilant prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Heartbeats and rhythms of life, all interwoven.
</P>
<P>
   On the drive back home, we were awed by the beauty of the spring
wildflowers along the highway. Bluebonnets, Indian paintbrushes and
primrose formed a vivid palette against the greening roadsides. In
the car, our three boys rumbled and grumbled with the fullness of
their own lives. It was a poignant drive, as I waited for the cell
phone to ring and bring us news about my brother.
</P>
<P>
   For Christians, spring also is the season of resurrection. No
surer sign exists that death is part of life and life is part of
death. What was dead comes to life; what was lost is found; despair
turns to inexpressible joy; a barricaded tomb opens and is empty.
What we expect to find, we often don't.
</P>
<P>
   Do we spend our lives denying death? Unrealistic as it is, do we
expect that it will not touch us? Or do we spend our lives
expecting death? Awaiting impending disaster in every illness,
every surgery, every unexpected turn in the road of our lives?
Either way, what we expect to find, we don't.
</P>
<P>
   The call about my brother finally came that day. He made it
through his surgery with three newly formed arteries. The heart of
this man was back in its rightful place. The road before him would
be long and hard, but at least it was still before him.
</P>
<P>
   We came home with a picture of our new grand-nephew, which now
beams out at us beside the other family pictures on our piano _ the
one of his sister in her Christmas dress, his cousin in a pumpkin
Halloween costume, my parents at their 50th wedding anniversary, my
sister and her family, our three boys in last year's school
pictures, my parents-in-law, now both gone . . . and my brother.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Lament for the last shag
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ The carpet was brought to rest at the end
of the driveway in a big brown roll. It looked like a cheap stogy
tossed away as unsmokable by a discerning giant.
</P>
<P>
   But this was not just any old, smelly carpet. This was The Last
Shag Carpet in America. Its removal after a quarter-century of wear
marks an end of an era. To dispose it, I didn't know whether to
alert the Smithsonian or the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   The '70s are symbolized by a number of cultural artifacts _
leisure suits, platform shoes, Donna Summer albums ... but these
all are things you could toss as cultural indicators changed. You
may have given that leisure suit to the Goodwill to celebrate the
fall of the Berlin Wall. Maybe you traded the double-knit jacket
for a power suit after you placed your first junk-bond order. With
good conscience you dumped the Donna Summer, Bee Gee and Fleetwood
Mac albums when you bought your first CD player. You might have
caused the Cabbage Patch dolls to disappear two closet cleanings
into middle school.
</P>
<P>
   But a shag carpet is different. Flooring is a choice you must
live with, and live with for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Like other bad decisions, I shirk all responsibility for this. I
was in high school when this carpet was brought to the showroom.
</P>
<P>
   I was not the person who said, ``Oh, brown and tan shag
carpeting! Just the thing for a house with animals! The stains will
look like they were meant to be there!''
</P>
<P>
   I was not the person who said, ``shag carpeting, like disco and
American Motors, is here to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Not me. I'm just the guy who bought the house assuring everyone
I'd get around to doing something about the flooring. It took me
only seven years.
</P>
<P>
   When the time rolled around for the carpet's final roll-up, it
was rotting and tearing in places. It had spots that smelled like a
warm day at the zoo. The pad beneath it was decaying into little
piles of noxious powder. I expected the carpet workman to handle it
wearing hazardous-material jumpsuits and respirators. After they
finished setting up roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the carpet filtered the sand of a quarter-century of
summer beach trips and the dirt of 1,000 stabs at gardening. Woven
into its pile were stains from five documented dogs and cats, past
and present. Nicotine and 250 other toxic trace compounds were
added by a former owner who chain-smoked. Spills from a dozen
parties and two very active children blended into its mottled color
pattern. Hidden inside its fibers were enough Legos to build a
small-but-intricate deep-space probe and enough pennies to buy
three white vinyl belts at the thrift store.
</P>
<P>
   That much life and living can overwhelm anything made of cloth.
Maybe not right away, but eventually and certainly within a quarter
century.
</P>
<P>
   After we rolled up the carpet, the kids felt faint, the cat ran
away and the dog growled at it ominously. He seemed concerned this
might be a living thing. He was not so far off.
</P>
<P>
   The old shag looked particularly evil in the bright light of the
outdoors. Something it hadn't seen since the Ford administration.
</P>
<P>
   We tend to think of houses as dead, static things. They aren't.
They rot. They change personality. A string of them will relate
differently to each other over time. They will start off identical
but have nothing to do with each other by the time they are
teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   For good or ill, houses change with us, just slower and more
painfully than the other things we live with.
</P>
<P>
   This house was a perfect '70s house at one time. Although it's
still a creature that time forgot, it is evolving.
</P>
<P>
   On bad days I felt like I was living in the ruins of the ``Brady
Bunch'' set. Doing my '90s business amid shag carpet,
pumpkin-colored tile and busy kitchen wallpaper with little flowers
and repeated pictures of old-fashioned coffee pots, pans, forks and
wooden spoons.
</P>
<P>
   The wallpaper was a pleasure to remove, although I was talked
out of using a flame thrower or explosives to do it. Collateral
damage. And now the house has shed its shag like a snake crawling
out of old skin, leaving this brown tube on the lawn.
</P>
<P>
   This creature may have stronger powers of adaptation than I used
to think. Maybe all it needs is just one more trip to the hardware
store.

 &HT;    Teachers, like moms, know when to keep quiet
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Benji and I are in the throes of an academic
disagreement when his little sister Sally comes in to claim her
lunch money. She stands hesitantly to one side of my desk, watching
and listening as Benji
</P>
<P>
   emphatically denies there are any misspelled words in his essay.
``I used the spellcheck,'' he tells me, expecting that to be the
end of the discussion. I shake my head and remind him that even the
smartest computers (which our hand-me-down dinosaurs aren't by a
long shot) are incapable of figuring out what's on his mind. ``You
at least have to come close.''
</P>
<P>
   He points to a couple of red circles in the second paragraph and
demands to know what's wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a thing,'' I assure him, ``if what you meant was:
`Marvin's mother set the table with some rye beard(sic) for toast
and a bowel(sic) full of strawberry jam because it was his
favorite.' Is that what you wanted to say?'' Benji's mouth drops
open and he starts eyeballing me like I'm kidding. I assure him I
wouldn't joke about a thing like this.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, his attitude shifts to one of irritation. ``So tell me,
Ms. Schuett, if I can't be sure the spellcheck is going to get it
right, what do I do? I can't possibly memorize every single word in
the whole dictionary.'' I remind him that folks have been spelling
for a long time _ ever since Wilma Flintstone scratched the first
grocery list on her cave wall: basket of berries, shank of beast,
and a six-pack of Mountain Dew. Long before Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Benji's not laughing. In fact, he's scrunching up his nose which
probably means he's stifling a sneeze or repositioning his
wire-frame glasses.
</P>
<P>
   Then Sally pipes up. ``Stop doing that to your nose, dummy. Mom
warned you what would happen if you keep doing that. Right Ms.
Schuett?'' I blindly agree and assure Benji that his mother knows
best.
</P>
<P>
   Benji's not in the mood for nitpicking. He tells his sister to
shut up and sets out to call my bluff: ``OK, Ms. Schuett,'' he
grins, ``what (SET ITAL)does(END ITAL) my mom say about my nose?''
</P>
<P>
   I place my hand over my eyes in a crummy imitation of Johnny
Carson doing Karnak the Omnipotent, and tell Benji that his mother
told him that if he didn't stop wrinkling up his nose like that,
he'd wake up one morning and discover it was stuck that way.
</P>
<P>
   Benji's amazed. ``How'd you know that?'' he asks doubtfully.
``Did you talk to my mom?'' I told him I didn't need to because the
consequences of juvenile nose wrinkling were universal knowledge
among mothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you think my nose got turned up on the end?'' I ask
innocently. Benji's not having any so he swings the subject back to
spelling. Sally's seen enough and is ready to go to lunch. She
demands her lunch money but Benji refuses to fork it over.
</P>
<P>
   Sally stomps her foot in an adept imitation of righteous
indignation, but when she realizes Benji is unmoved, she tries a
different tack. Blackmail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Schuett,'' she asks slyly, ``have you smelled anything
funny around Benji lately?'' Her brother glares at her, reinforcing
the old ``if looks could kill'' cliche, and warns her to shut up.
She sticks out her hand, palm up, waiting for her money. Benji
pretends to spit in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's it, bird breath!'' Sally warns her brother as she turns
to me and dissolves into a giggle-fit. ``Guess what, Ms. Schuett.
The cat peed in Benji's sneaker. Pass it on.''
</P>
<P>
   Exasperated, Benji and his stinky sneaker stomp out of the room.
I loan Sally lunch money, and silently promise myself never to
admit to either one of them that I had already known about Benji's
misfortune. He'd been smelling like a sandbox all week.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, teachers, like mothers, don't tell everything they
know.

 &HT;    Equal pay eludes America's women
 &HT;    By Ana Pecina Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ In America, money talks.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, money puts its foot smack dab in its mouth.
</P>
<P>
   A very interesting item arrived by fax on Equal Pay Day. That
was Thursday, in case you missed the story.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things that happened Wednesday was a roundtable
discussion of the still existing pay gap between men and women in
the labor force. The president's Council of Economic Advisers
reported last year that women earn about 75 cents for every dollar
a man earns.
</P>
<P>
   The president is pushing the Paycheck Fairness Act in Congress.
In 1963, President Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act. That was when
women still earned 58 cents for every dollar paid to male workers.
I guess it didn't take.
</P>
<P>
   During last week's discussion, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
remarked that many still claim inequitable pay is a ``made-up
problem'' but that such discrimination is very real though very
subtle.
</P>
<P>
   The fax statement I received, in response to Equal Pay Day
efforts, was from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, an essay under the
name of Thomas J. Donohue, president and CEO. He acknowledges ``a
few bad actors'' but agrees it is reasonable that women and men
with the same experience doing the same job should be paid the
same. However, he fears more government intervention, more lawsuits
and a stagnant economy if the act passes.
</P>
<P>
   You know, the same hysterical stuff we hear whenever the minimum
wage goes up, except that the predicted end to small business in
America has yet to happen. The other thing that's failed to happen
is equal pay.
</P>
<P>
   The ``subtle'' discrimination is not too subtle if you take a
look around. Donohue states that if women workers really came that
cheap, then everybody would have an all-female work force.
</P>
<P>
   Look in the classroom, sir.
</P>
<P>
   See the women teachers.
</P>
<P>
   See the rotten pay.
</P>
<P>
   See the men? No. They have gone to higher paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the many other low paying jobs and job categories and
see them populated by women. Watch salaries drop as women enter
once male dominated fields, even medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the lowest paying job, producing and rearing children.
We dollar-loving Americans talk a great line. We go on about how
important it is that children have a good beginning and how they
need someone to care for them and how, well, we just wouldn't be
here without our mamas.
</P>
<P>
   So what do we pay them?
</P>
<P>
   Not a dime.
</P>
<P>
   Because you see, it's their choice. Mr. Donohue says so. He
quotes a study, by two women no less, that ``women in their 20s and
30s who have never had children make virtually the same amount as
their male counterparts.''
</P>
<P>
   What is the message there? Have kids and pay the price? Don't
have kids and you'll earn equitable pay? If that message is heard
by many more, Mr. Donohue won't have anyone to fill those
low-paying jobs because if we have fewer babies, it means fewer
workers. And as happens with a shrinking labor force, salaries will
go up.
</P>
<P>
   Wait. Maybe I misjudged him. Maybe he does really want pay to go
up _ for everyone!
</P>
<P>
   Talk about a master of subtlety.

 &HT;    Casting Net can turn up a sea of fishing info
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Think of it as a fish Net.
</P>
<P>
   For a fisherman, the Internet is almost as handy as a good
source of red wiggler worms or a lifetime supply of Red Coachman
flies. And now that it's spring, many of us will leave the ghostly
light of the computer monitor for some time spent in the sunshine
on a river or lake.
</P>
<P>
   Let's take a look at some of the fishing information you can
find on the Web. Since this column is produced in Georgia, we'll
also look at some sites that offer specific help for here. Don't be
discouraged if you live in another state. A few minutes with a
search engine such as AltaVista or Yahoo! will produce plenty of
localized fishing sites.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to fishing, all of us are beginners. Even if you
know a lot about trout fishing, you may not know beans about
catching bluegill bream. A bass expert may be able to cite chapter
and verse on the various plastic worms available but be mystified
when it comes time to head north for a vacation fishing trip for
walleyes.
</P>
<P>
   So we'll start with a page called the Fishing Network at
www.the-fishing-network
</P>
<P>
   .com/. This is a terrific site because _ like a good tackle box
_ it contains almost everything you'll need. There are sections
that offer specific fishing advice for the various species of
freshwater fish; weather forecasts; chat areas where you can tell
your fishing story to someone who actually would like to hear it;
information on records (that way you'll know if that big bream is a
world-record-sized catch); calendars of outdoor and fishing
expositions and shows; and even a nice selection of fishing clip
art if you'd like to decorate a Web page or just add a picture of a
fish to an e-mail or newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Now that you have gathered some information, you'll want to get
a fishing license. After all, the money you spend for the license
will be used to stock the rivers and lakes, so it's money well
spent. Besides, those who don't have a license can find that the
fines make for a very expensive trip.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, you can get all the information you need about
licenses and fishing regulations at a Web site run by the state at
www.dnr.state.ga.us/dnr/wild
</P>
<P>
   /fishingreg/. You'll find out, for example, when the season
starts for various types of fish and how many you're allowed to
catch. And, for those who want to try fishing but are reluctant to
buy a license, go to www.dnr.state.ga
</P>
<P>
   .us/dnr/wild/fishingreg/freefish
</P>
<P>
   .html and find out about ``free fishing days'' in Georgia when
no license or trout stamp is required.
</P>
<P>
   Next you'll want to find out where the fish are biting. A good
source for Georgia information is located at www.wmi.org
</P>
<P>
   /bassfish/reports/GEORGIA/. You'll find a complete list of
lakes. Click on the place that interests you, and you'll get a good
report. Each report is dated, so you'll know how recent the
information is. (If you live in another state, try www.wmi.org
</P>
<P>
   /bassfish/reports/ and check to see if your state is listed so
that you can get the same type of information.)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if you really want to put your computer to work as a
fishing buddy, you can download a program that offers you advice.
You'll enter information about the weather, time of year, species
of fish and then get help from the program. You can download a free
demonstration version of the program at ourworld
</P>
<P>
   .compuserve.com/homepages
</P>
<P>
   /strattech/fishexpe.htm (look for the link at the very bottom of
the page). Or you can order the commercial version of the program
for $26.

 &HT;    Apple's OS 8.6 called `incredibly stable'
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Apple Computer is readying the latest version of its
operating system. Called 8.6, this version of the Mac's OS is
expected to be released _ probably for free _ later this month or
in early May.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing earth-shaking in 8.6, but this version
represents a steady improvement. Indeed, the release alone shows
Apple Computer's newfound stability. The company has systematically
released OS upgrades every six months for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer is not saying anything official yet about OS 8.6,
but the Internet is filled with news about it. Here are some of the
more important improvements, gleaned from credible sources such as
MacWeek and MacOS World.
</P>
<P>
   OS 8.6's new features include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Better multitasking. Multitasking is the ability to perform
several functions at once, such as emptying the trash and copying
files. The Mac already can handle some multitasking, but Apple
Computer will now let users launch applications while their Macs
empty the trash with 8.6.
</P>
<P>
   _ Better system stability. The current system, 8.5, has plagued
some users with random and inexplicable crashes. The bugs that
caused these crashes have been fixed. Beta testers have reported
that 8.6 is ``incredibly stable.''
</P>
<P>
   _ New Sherlock interface. Sherlock is Apple Computer's new
search technology, which scans not only within files but also
across the Internet. In OS 8.6, Sherlock's window listing plug-ins
is now resizable.
</P>
<P>
   _ New Start-Up Control Panel. Apple Computer has rewritten this
mini-program so that it easily lets you connect to a server and a
network.
</P>
<P>
   _ Improved internal codes. Apple Computer has updated many of
its internal parts with 8.6. Among the things improved are video
drivers, laserwriter software, DVD software, Open Transport,
AppleScript and FireWire video drivers.
</P>
<P>
   While no particular item is big, all these small improvements
will add up to a lot in 8.6.
</P>
<P>
   And 8.6 is a big step forward to Apple Computer's next major
release, called OS X. OS X is Apple's answer to Microsoft's
powerful Windows NT software.
</P>
<P>
   The company says OS X will run preemptive multitasking. It will
also offer protected memory, advanced virtual memory and
multithreading.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago no one would have believed Apple could pull off OS
X. After all, it had failed to pull off two previous major system
upgrades. But there's great confidence in Apple, given its return
to profitability and success in rolling out system maintenance
upgrades such as 8.6.

 &HT;    Salon brings depth to Kosovo coverage
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``The cruelty is unimaginable,'' writes Laura Rozen,
who is covering the war in Yugoslavia from nearby Macedonia for
online Webzine Salon.com. Rozen is an excellent storyteller, and
her reports of the tragedy of the Kosovars _ businessmen,
secretaries, housewives, blue-collar workers and schoolchildren
suddenly stripped of everything but the clothes on their backs _
are riveting.
</P>
<P>
   It's a must-read for those who want to go beyond political
posturing and understand what really is happening to the displaced
people of Kosovo and the bomb-weary residents of Belgrade
(www.salon.com/news
</P>
<P>
   /feature/1999/04/05/kosovo/).
</P>
<P>
   Salon's coverage of the war in Yugoslavia has a breadth and
depth unexpected of a nontraditional, Web-only publication. While
Rozen reports from the scene, Joe Conason stays home, but wonders
why potential presidential candidate George W. Bush hasn't taken a
stand on the NATO bombings in an article called ``The Wobblers''
(www.salonmagazine.com/news/col/cona/1999/04/06/conason/).
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush's nervous failure to take a stand on the most pressing
question of the moment recalls Margaret Thatcher's admonition to
his dad, George Sr., when hostilities started in the Persian Gulf:
`Don't go wobbly on me now,''' Conason writes. ``Bush's wobbling on
Kosovo is the inevitable product of his urge to please all factions
in his divided party.''
</P>
<P>
   This news coverage is a strong showing from Salon, which stormed
its way into the Web news business last year with sensational and,
some say, biased coverage of the Clinton sex scandal and its
30-year-old revelations of an affair by Rep. Henry Hyde, chairman
of the committee conducting the presidential inquiry. Now the site
ranks in the top 500 most popular sites on the Web and seems to
have reporters doing real reporting from every corner and every
angle of the Kosovo story.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo coverage is just another high point in what's been a
pretty big week for Salon. First, founder and CEO David Talbot
finally wrestled away the Salon.com Web address with a promise of
stock and an undisclosed payment to Roy Frederickson, owner of two
beauty salons in Austin, Texas, who had hoped to develop a portal
for the hairdressing industry. Previously, the 1.2 million monthly
Salon junkies have been getting to the site by bookmarking
Salonmagazine.com or salon.net or salon1999.com, the address the
site launched with in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Salon took over the Salon.com address Monday (4/5) and launched
a redesigned site that separated content into areas including news,
arts, technology, health, books and the popular ``Mothers Who
Think.''
</P>
<P>
   This one small shift makes stories easy to find. And the stories
are worth finding whether it's breaking news about Yugoslavia, or
David Ratoff, or Michelle Goldman deconstructing Gwyneth Paltrow.
Salon seems have its pulse on what people are talking about,
thinking about, wondering about or might actually be doing, as is
the case of Thomas Scolville's workplace serial ``Silicon Follies''
(www.salon.com/21st/follies/about/about.html).
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a medium for New Yorker-type content. It's a
medium for newspaper-type content,'' Talbot has said. ``What the
Web is mostly known for at this point is cud-chewing punditry.
That's fine. It's a good medium for that. We decided we want to go
beyond that and start breaking stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Talbot says he knows his boutique publication can't compete with
massive newsgathering organizations such as CNN or MSNBC, but as
Talbot's staff continues to go where the news and pop culture are
heading, he may have also unwittingly found the secret to making
content profitable.
</P>
<P>
   To paraphrase James Carville: It's the interactivity, stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Salon's stable of ``cud-chewing pundits,'' who write for the
magazine, combined with the ``cud-chewing pundits'' who post
messages to Salon's Table Talk and who log onto one or more of the
200 discussion groups on the Well, the celebrated online community
Salon acquired Wednesday, could really make Salon a salon. The
artists, writers, technology geeks, academic types and other deep
thinkers who populate the Well will now be able to ``chew their
cud,'' about the news and trends of the day _ the same topics so
comprehensively covered in Salon.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Salon nor the Well will say just how Salon will
integrate it on the Web _ if it plans to integrate it at all. But a
few carefully placed links on the Well site could attract just the
sort of sophisticated, Web-savvy readers Salon covets. They're
exactly the type who might pony up $25 to become Salon members,
too.
</P>
<P>
   With the acquisition of the Well, Salon may be on its way to
having it all _ content, community and commerce. It's a combination
readers on Main Street and investors on Wall Street may find
irresistible. So, keep an eye out for those war dispatches _ and an
initial public offering.

 &HT;    10-year-old bounces back after heart transplant
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ten-year-old Nick May rides his bike, goes swimming
and plays basketball just like his friends.
</P>
<P>
   But when May takes off his shirt in the summer, he looks a
little bit different. His tanned chest has a long scar _ a reminder
of the heart transplant he had when he was a baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the bump is kind of cool,'' said May, who has green
eyes and brown hair. ``It makes me a little special.''
</P>
<P>
   Like thousands of other children's hearts, May's heart didn't
work right when he was born. Instead of having four chambers in his
heart, May only had three _ a condition considered life
threatening.
</P>
<P>
   The heart needs to work correctly because it has to pump all the
blood and oxygen through the body. If it isn't able to do that _
either because of a defect or disease _ the body gets tired and
doesn't work right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the heart just wears out like a car engine,'' said
Dr. Robert Vincent, the medical director of pediatric heart
transplants at Egleston-Scottish Rite Medical Center in Atlanta.
``Sometimes, we can do surgery to fix it. But sometimes, we just
need to replace it.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the case with May, who had a heart transplant when he
was almost 2 years old.
</P>
<P>
   But most kids don't have such serious problems. For example,
more than half of all children are born with heart murmurs. Murmurs
are unusual sounds that doctors hear as they listen to blood
flowing through the heart _ similar to listening to water flowing
through the pipes of a house, Vincent said.
</P>
<P>
   But of those, only 5 in 1,000 actually have a problem that needs
to be fixed, he said. ``Heart murmurs are very common, but heart
defects are very rare,'' Vincent said.
</P>
<P>
   The most common defect is called ``ventricular septal defect,''
Vincent said. Usually, it is found and corrected in babies by the
time they are only 4 months old. This defect is basically a hole in
the wall between the heart's two pumping chambers, keeping the
organ from working correctly. Surgery can fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
   And because medicine has gotten better, most children with heart
problems can live like anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   May's days are like other kids' _ he throws on his clothes, eats
breakfast, and takes out the garbage (one of his many chores)
before going to school. At school, he participates in gym and
recess. He loves spelling. And at the end of the day, he does his
homework, helps with dinner and plays with his best friend, Clay.
</P>
<P>
   There are some differences, his mom, Susan May, says.
</P>
<P>
   May cannot play football, and he can't wrestle. That's because
doctors don't want to take a chance of someone hurting his heart.
And he must rest periodically while playing games. Unlike others,
he has no nerves to his heart because they had to be cut during his
transplant operation. That means his brain can't receive any
messages from his heart about how hard it's working. He has to plan
rest times to let his heart relax a little.
</P>
<P>
   And he has to take lots of pills so that his body doesn't reject
his new heart. In the morning, he has to take seven pills that are
pink, white and yellow. And in the evening, he has to take four
more pills.
</P>
<P>
   He also has to deal with two common questions: Where did his new
heart come from, and how much does it cost?
</P>
<P>
   Susan May said the surgery cost more than $100,000 and Nick
May's monthly medicine bill is $500. May's heart came from a little
boy who was accidently run over by a truck in his driveway.
</P>
<P>
   It is very sad for Nick and his family to think about this
child. But they are also very grateful that the child's parents
were kind enough to donate the heart even though their child died.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the greatest joy for me,'' Susan May said, ``is I've
got my child here with me because someone gave an incredible
gift.''

 &HT;    Allies continue bombings in Yugoslavia
 &HT;    By Staff reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Air strikes continued last week against the Serbs in
Yugoslavia, even though the Serb government said its attacks on the
Albanians living in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo were over.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) allies started attacking the Serbs three weeks ago. The
allies say the Serbs were trying to kill or displace the Kosovar
Albanians. The Kosovar Albanians want their province to be free of
Serb control.
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin of Russia, a country that is friendly to
the Serbs, is threatening to aim Russian missiles at NATO countries
if bombings of Yugoslavia continue. LOST WORLD

   Scientists hit fossil jackpot
</P>
<P>
   Paleontologists (scientists who study dinosaurs and other
ancient forms of life) have found their own ``Jurassic Park'' off
the coast of England _ except all the dinosaurs are dead. The
scientists don't mind, though, because they can still learn a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Usually fossils are buried deep and are spread out. However, the
Isle of Wight fossils are concentrated in two tiny strips of land
very close to the surface. The tides and strong winds remove layers
of rock from the cliffs, unearthing the fossils.
</P>
<P>
   A PINE MESS
</P>
<P>
   Don't climb the tress

<P>
   We've all heard rules like ``No jumping on the bed'' and ``No

trees''?
</P>
<P>
   That's what a park ranger told a man and his two daughters in
New York City's Central Park. The dad was fined $1,000 because his
daughters sat in a Japanese white pine tree.
</P>
<P>
   The dad says, ``Please give me a warning. I will make sure that
it will not happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   But park officials say it was too late _ the tree was damaged.
They said the trees are not native to New York and cost several
thousand dollars each.

<P>
   Olympic gymnast Dominique Moceanu may have found peace with her
parents.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-year-old gold medalist sued for her independence in the
fall, saying her father wasted the money she earned as a
professional gymnast. Her parents placed her money in a trust fund,
which they controlled. Moceanu would gain access to the money at
age 35.
</P>
<P>
   A judge declared her an adult in October. But it wasn't until
last week that she signed a financial settlement with her parents.
The details of the agreement were kept secret.

 &HT;    Pokemon portable video game popping up everywhere
 &HT;    By Jennifer Hill
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Move over, Beanie Babies. Pokemon have seized the day.
And like those cuddly, stuffed, fabled toys of yesterday's trend,
there's seemingly a million of 'em.
</P>
<P>
   If you've heard your children talking about Squirtles and
Charizards, your household has been hit by the Pokemon bug. Since
hitting the U.S. market in September 1998, Nintendo has sold 1.5
million units, making it the fastest-selling Gameboy game ever.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Gameboy's portability, the game is played everywhere
from morning school carpools to playgrounds or any other place a
spare moment opens up. Where only a few months ago clusters of boys
put wildly colored plastic yo-yos through their paces, now many of
those same boys are huddled playing Pokemon.
</P>
<P>
   In the peculiar culture of video games, proximity can serve as
interaction. That is to say, two, three or four boys can all be
playing individual Gameboys but be communing with one another. But
with Pokemon, you advance your game by linking with another
player's Gameboy to trade Pokemon. Plus, you can also use the game
link cable to battle other players. (Of course, to do this you need
a game link cable, which costs about $10.)
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the parental purse, Nintendo makes two
versions of the game _ Red and Blue. Each game, which sells for
about $29, has a slightly different subset of the 150 different
Pokemon. So to collect all 150, you have to trade by linking up
with another player who has the other version of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The object of the game is to find, train, collect and use the
Pokemon in battle with other Pokemon trainers. When your Pokemon
defeats another in battle, you capture it and add it to your
collection.
</P>
<P>
   When you train your Pokemon, they evolve from lovable little
critters to larger and mostly still lovable creatures with a
variety of powers. For example, Squirtle evolves into Wartortle and
ultimately Blastoise. (Certainly makes your wonder if the author of
the American version names grew up in the Bronx, doesn't it?)
Depending on how they are trained, two Pokemon of the same type
could end up having different abilities in their full-grown state.
</P>
<P>
   The Pokemon onslaught shows no sign of slowing down. Episodes of
a cartoon show feature two-dimensional characters that only game
fanatics would know and love. According to Nintendo, the Pokemon
animated cartoon series is the top syndicated kids show in all
major U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
   And as if 150 Pokemon weren't enough, there are more video
versions to come featuring new critters. Nintendo plans to release
``Pokemon Pinball'' for Gameboy and ``Pokemon Snap'' for N64 in
late June. Japanese versions are already available.
</P>
<P>
   Pokemon trading cards, which appeared a few months ago, are
being snapped up with the same frenzy as Magic cards were in their
heyday. More than 50 million have been sold since December.
Currently, a yellow Volkswagen Beetle made up to like Pikachu, a
round yellow Pokemon that looks like a vertically challenged
relative of the Pillsbury Doughboy with tail, is making its way
across the country attending Pokemon trading card events.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro, the toymaker, has weighed in with collectible toys
featuring the Pokemon characters.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the Internet is a part of the Pokemon craze.
In addition to official Nintendo sites www.pokemon.com/ and
www.nintendo.com/gb/pokemon/index.html, there are scores of sites
maintained by game devotees. One such site, Pikachu Centre at
www.nintendo.com/gb/pokemon/index.html, has a wealth of information
about the current as well upcoming and Japanese versions of the
games.
</P>
<P>
   Having a hard time capturing the Tauros Pokemon? Many of these
sites features tips sent in by other gamers on everything from
training Pokemon faster to help finding the rarest Pokemon.
</P>
<P>
   The expected June release of the new games will likely breath
new life into the game's popularity, ensuring its fans will take
the game's slogan to heart _ ``Got to catch 'em all.''

 &HT;    Windows looks at 15 common PC problems
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Computers and operating systems break down all too
often. Now you can find solutions to some problems in the April
issue of Windows magazine. Its cover story is devoted to fixing 15
common PC problems. You'll find suggestions on how to fix scanners
that don't scan, sleeping computers that don't wake up and random
system hang-ups.
</P>
<P>
   The April issue of Windows also includes a preview of the coming
upgrade of WordPerfect Office Suite, the biggest competitor to
Microsoft Office. Windows gives WordPerfect Office a generally
thumbs up review. It says maker Corel has focused on making the
program easier to use. There are a couple of new features, such as
one that lets you preview a change in style before making it
permanent in a document.
</P>
<P>
   On CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   Springtime is academic test time, and there's some new software
out to help kids prepare. Emergency Prep is a computer CD that
offers a crash course in preparing for college admission tests.
It's a one-week course that claims to offer techniques for educated
guessing as well as time-saving strategies. Emergency Prep is
published by Kaplan, the leader in test preparation courses, and
Knowledge Adventure. It's available for both Macs and PCs.
</P>
<P>
   You can command a futurist tank battleship in ``Thunder
Brigade,'' a new arcade-type game from Interactive Magic. In
``Thunder Brigade,'' you command a flying tank. It's well-armed and
highly mobile. You move across a dozen different planets, fighting
as a member of a freedom brigade. The bad guys are members of the
Halon Empire, described in the game as ``cruel warmongers.'' You
play as a member of the Earth Alliance, ``a highly disciplined and
well-equipped'' group of fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Online
</P>
<P>
   Here's a Web site that's different. NY-Taxi.com offers a tour of
the Big Apple _ from a cab driver's perspective. The site is based
on a popular new book, ``New York City From a Cab Driver's View.''
It's written by a real cab driver named Clever Da Silva. I kid you
not. You'll find this site at www.ny-taxi.com/.
</P>
<P>
   Check out the bookstore of the future at NetLibrary. This is a
site that offers totally electronic books for sale. That is, you
download these books onto your computer for reading. NetLibrary
also offers some free books, which are in the public domain. You'll
find NetLibrary at www.netlibrary.com.

 &HT;    Public Agenda well-informed
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Its tag line, the ``Journalist's Inside Source for
Public Opinion and Policy Analysis,'' might turn off any nonworking
journalist. But don't let it. The public opinion Web site is
worthwhile for anyone who enjoys informed debate.
</P>
<P>
   The contentious issues of our time are listed along the left
side of the opening page of the Web site, www.publicagenda.org. A
click on one, abortion, brings a list of options organized under
two sections: ``Understanding the Issue'' and ``Public Opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Understanding the Issue'' includes an overview of the topic,
including statistics and a history of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Notable &AMP; Newsworthy'' subsection offers links to recent
stories relevant to abortion, including stories about the hunt for
Eric Robert Rudolph in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Fact File'' subsection offers a litany of statistics. For
abortion, the stats include age groups, the number of weeks into
the pregnancy that the abortion takes place and the reasons women
give for having them.
</P>
<P>
   The subsection called ``Framing the Debate'' lays out the major
perspectives. In this case, it's ``respecting life,'' ``respecting
the right to choose'' and ``respecting differences.'' Another link,
``Sources and Resources,'' offers hyperlinks to other Web sites,
contacts, phone numbers and addresses for some of the organizations
that follow the issue, such as the American Civil Liberties Union
and the Alan Guttmacher Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The second section, ``Public Opinion,'' has links to stories on
major points of view on the topic. Also included is a discussion
about how to avoid misrepresenting some of the statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site is run by Public Agenda, a nonpartisan, nonprofit
public opinion research and education group based in New York City.
The organization was founded in 1975 by social scientist and author
Daniel Yankelovich and former Secretary of State Cyrus Vance.
</P>
<P>
   Public Agenda considers its mission to help leaders understand
the public's point of view on major policy issues and to help
citizens understand critical policy issues so they can make better
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   New color copiers
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard recently released a new round of digital color
copiers starting at $499.
</P>
<P>
   The HP Color Copier 160/170 is expected to sell for around $499.
The HP Color Copier 260/270 has a suggested retail price of $599.
The new copiers are sold at HP retailers.
</P>
<P>
   HP is gearing the copiers for the small-business market. The
copiers can copy color brochures, business presentations and
promotional materials. Small runs of color marketing materials or
presentations can be copied for 10 cents per copy, according to
Hewlett-Packard. The copiers handle up to 10 copies per minute.
</P>
<P>
   More information about the copiers is available at
www.hp.com/go/copiers.
</P>
<P>
   Check this calendar
</P>
<P>
   If your company or you are too financially conservative to
upgrade to the new line of full-service calendar software products,
there is a free version online.
</P>
<P>
   Jintek's ScheduleOnline is geared for the small to midsize
businesses. The calendar is available at www.scheduleonline.com.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego-based company is billing itself as the intranet
solution for organizations without the resources to get or run
full-service software applications. Intranets are private
Internets.
</P>
<P>
   The calendar functions let users maintain personal calendars,
set up meetings within their organizations and check for schedule
conflicts. If a user picks a specific date for an appointment, the
calendar function offers the choice of automatically sending an
invitation e-mail to attendees.
</P>
<P>
   PC Magazine said of ScheduleOnline: ``Ideal for organizations
needing to manage their people, places and things, ScheduleOnline
is fast and highly functional. ... Groups seeking online management
assistance should start by looking at this elegant and useful
site.''

 &HT;    First-aid kit can help you survive computer crash
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Back when I owned a 1968 MG-B _ when gasoline was 29
cents a gallon and nerds owned slide rules instead of computers _ I
could keep my car running myself.
</P>
<P>
   All that was required was a moderate amount of bravery, socket
wrenches and a bank account that was deposited in a half-gallon
wine jar. But as time passed, cars got more sophisticated with
computers that monitor and control the engine, fuel injection
systems and electronic modules that are meant to be replaced, not
fixed.
</P>
<P>
   It is the same with computers. When I started out, we not only
fixed our own computers, we built them. The computer programs, in
those earliest days, were written in a language called BASIC, and
software stores didn't exist. Instead, we created our own programs
by typing in computer code (often copied directly from one of the
early computer magazines).
</P>
<P>
   Even with all that, computers were fairly easy to understand and
fix. There were two big factors going for us. For one, we knew
something about the computer since we built it with chips,
resistors and late-night curses. For another, it was a relatively
simple beast, like that old MG-B of mine.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, computers are so complex that most of us are way over
our heads when it comes to working on them. Besides, today's users
are very different from the earliest computer enthusiasts. The
computer is now an appliance, and just as most of us don't expect
to be able to work on a refrigerator, few users have much interest
in learning how the thing works.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, there are a few things you can do yourself to
protect your computer against future troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with a crash recovery disk. You'll need it if your
computer takes a page from the behavior of that old MG-B and
refuses to start one day. There are a lot of possible reasons for
that calamity, ranging from a hard disk with mechanical problems to
conflicts caused by installing a new device or software. You'll
eventually care about the cause, but _ before you can reach that
state _ you'll need to get the computer going. The crash recovery
disk bypasses the hard disk and any problems there and gets the
computer going.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, this is one case where that complex computer of yours
will make things easy. Just double click to open the Control Panel,
open up the Add/Remove Program icon and select the tab labeled
Startup Disk. Just follow the instructions you'll find there to
create the disk. Since space is limited and you'll find the process
fairly painless, we'll move on to the next item.
</P>
<P>
   Think of this step as creating a first-aid kit for your
computer. If you've ever had a computer disaster, you already know
how that can freeze your brain. The disk with the drivers for your
video card becomes impossible to find, the manual that you got with
your computer _ the very thing you need to work on the problem _
has disappeared. And you can't even find the right-size screwdriver
to open up the computer case.
</P>
<P>
   You can already see where I'm going. Find a small plastic box
and fill it with everything you'd need if your computer crashed.
Add the crash recovery disk you just made, all the manuals for your
computer and accessories, the Windows installation disk, and
screwdrivers to open up the machine as well as the disks you'd need
to reinstall your regular programs. Make sure you include
passwords, network settings and user names for your Internet
account.
</P>
<P>
   A prudent person would add a bottle of aspirin to that first-aid
kit. The aspirin won't help the computer, but you'll probably need
it.

 &HT;    USB camera ran afoul of immature technology
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Those of you who waded through the past couple of
episodes may have been left with the idea that the Philips USB PC
Camera, which provided me so many hours of gleeful entertainment,
is a total waste of time. That is not the case.
</P>
<P>
   I ran afoul of what we cognoscenti call ``immature technology.''
I had no sooner reached this conclusion than what should arrive but
an electronic message from a computer columnist at another large
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   He said he got a few chuckles at all the problems I had with
this little gadget, especially in light of the fact that he found
the Philips USB Camera to be very easy to install.
</P>
<P>
   I figured the curse of the Bus of Doom was already working on me
when he gallantly went on to say that he thought both views were
valid, and the culprit was the Universal Serial Bus its own self.
Its technology, in his opinion, was not yet mature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes to show that people should read more than one
review,'' he remarked. Amen.
</P>
<P>
   So the camera is one of those things that might work for you,
and then it might not. I imagine that the older your computer is,
the less likely it will be to work.
</P>
<P>
   Immature technology is something that was invented about the
same time as computers. It used to be, in the good old days, that
technology was allowed to mature in the laboratory before it was
inflicted upon the public. No longer. In the computer business, we
hop from one grand invention to another like a frog between lily
pads.
</P>
<P>
   Today's greatest thing since sliced bread will, in a year or so,
be replaced entirely by the greatest thing since the greatest thing
since sliced bread. What's more, we know it. Every year, Intel
produces a microprocessor many times faster than last year's. They
know they're going to do it. We know they're going to do it. The
question is, why can't they skip a few iterations, and then let us
slide happily along for a few years without having our computers
become obsolete before they get dusty?
</P>
<P>
   I don't really know. Trying to find out seems somehow like
asking Wotan why he decided to come down to Earth and start messing
with mortal women. But I suspect the applause of delighted
stockholders has something to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   Something like the Universal Serial Bus comes along, and
everyone has to figure out how to make something to plug into it.
But it takes some time, apparently, for everybody's USB to be the
same. When they are all the same, the technology is mature, and
will be ready to be rendered obsolete by something immature.
</P>
<P>
   It has always been thus.
</P>
<P>
   I can recall spending almost an entire day in the back room of a
computer store watching a very knowledgable salesman-technician
trying to make a 300-baud, state-of-the-art Hayes modem and
software work with my CP/M computer.
</P>
<P>
   The miserable thing wouldn't even take over the line and dial
for the first couple of hours. Somehow he got past the point of
dialing, but it wouldn't sustain a connection. It never would work.
</P>
<P>
   The store is gone now. So is Hayes. I know people who can talk
faster than a 300-baud modem could transmit data. But
communications technology is basically mature _ you plug your modem
into the receptacle with a little telephone icon beside it, plug
the phone line into the modem, turn on the computer, and the
chances are the computer will find the modem and set it up
automatically. Then the software will search for the modem, find
it, and set itself up. Not every time, but usually.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane S. Greig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: Please tell me how round toothpicks are made. I can imagine
little men standing before little lathes, yet I can't quite accept
that vision. _Jim Reece
</P>
<P>
   A: Here is the lowdown from Diamond Brands _ parent company of
toothpick giant Forster. Forster makes 7.2 billion toothpicks per
year. One-hundred-inch birch logs are cut into blocks which are
cooked with raw steam and veneered with a lathe. Veneered wood
sheets are processed in a dryer to remove moisture, cut into card
sizes and fed into a molding machine, which makes 12,000 round
dowels per minute! The dowels are then polished and pointed. The
final step is a shaker machine that packs 250 round toothpicks in a
box _ one box per second. Tomorrow, class _ how they make flat
toothpicks, which outsell round ones. Who brought America this oral
gratification device for adult men in pickups? Charles Forster in
1869, after noticing Brazilians whittling toothpicks from orange
trees. Until that time toothpicks were nondisposable items. To get
the idea across, Forster hired young men to demand disposable
toothpicks in restaurants all over Boston. Q: I have a request from
a German exchange student. Can you locate a Duke University
basketball jersey for him? _Eric Anderson
</P>
<P>
   A: Sure he doesn't want a UConn one instead? Order Duke Blue
Devil team wear _ golf shirts to shorts to volleyball T-shirts _ by
calling (800) VIA-DUKE. Basketball jerseys (royal/white,
reversible) are $25.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Last summer I had twins and my first cousin had quads. We
were talking about how we are all related. I think that I am her
children's second cousin and that our children are third cousins.
She thinks that she is my children's second cousin and that our
children are first cousins once removed. What is it? Would you
explain how someone is related once or twice removed? _Monica
Carlson
</P>
<P>
   A: Your children and her children are second cousins, says
genealogy whiz Erna Martin at the Texas State Library and Archives.
And your relationship to the quads? First cousin, once removed.
Here is the system for relationships in a nutshell: Find the
ancestor common to two people. The common ancestor is ``zero.''
Count down the generations to the subjects you are defining (in
this case, you're No. 2 from the common ancestor and your cousin's
quads are No. 3). Subtract one from the smaller number of
generations (No. 2 minus 1) to establish the cousin relationship.
Voila! First cousins. Next, subtract the smaller number of
generations from the larger number (No. 3 minus No. 2) to yield
``times removed.'' Thus, you're first cousins once removed. Too
much to remember? Send me a stamped, self-addressed envelope for a
copy of the ``Relationship Chart,'' which does the work for you _ a
fill-in-the-blank for first through seventh cousins and even those
pesky fourth cousins, three times removed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the best way to get my credit report? _Carol Jennings
</P>
<P>
   A: Credit reports are available from three bureaus, and all
charge for the reports. Fees are waved for residents of some states
(not Texas) and for those who have been denied credit, insurance,
employment or rental housing based on an incorrect report; the
unemployed seeking employment; or victims of fraud. The three
companies are: Experian (TRW), P.O. Box 2104, Allen, Texas

<P>
   Q: I need your readers' help! I substitute in area elementaries
and teachers are glad for me to help students learn to collect
stamps. I did this for years when I had my own classroom. Would
readers be willing to tear the canceled stamped corners of their
mail and put them in an envelope to me? _Pam Binder
</P>
<P>
   A: Easy way to encourage young philatelists, readers. Send
canceled stamps to Binder's Stampfinders, 9605 Gambels Quail Drive,
Austin 78758-6224.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know you can take metal mini-blinds outside and wash them
down with a hose but I have two-inch, white, wooden blinds in my
home. How do I clean these? They are really dusty. If I water-hosed
them down on a sunny day when they would dry quickly, would I be
doing them any harm? Also what can I use to clean the white plastic
patio furniture? It got really dirty over the winter and nothing
seems to get it white again. _Linda Rives
</P>
<P>
   A: Do not use water on wood. Drapery and blind expert Candy
McWilliams at ABC Blind and Drapery says the only way to get them
clean is to vacuum the blinds and then wipe each slat individually.
That is what they do for the wood blinds on display. The patio
furniture should respond to either a power sprayer or hand washing
with bleach and water (about one cup bleach to six cups water). A
good scrub brush and patience usually works. Q: Suddenly, all my
wife's gold rings _ college ring, wedding band, special rings, all
14K gold _ have started to stain her fingers as if the darn things
were made of brass. This problem shows up intermittently and is
somewhat embarrassing to her. Is she secreting (if that's the
proper word) some chemical causing this problem?
</P>
<P>
   _J. Johnson
</P>
<P>
   A: Your wife's body chemistry may have changed, says Austin
jeweler Benard Laves. She may be reacting to a metal used in 14K
gold _ nickel, copper or zinc. Dr. Eugene Schoch Jr. advises your
wife to get a general physical checkup to see how/if her body
chemistry has changed and to look at the medications she is taking.
As long as her general health is good there is no reason to believe
this is a sign of anything serious _ just an inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where did Camp Lejeune gets its name? I think I may be
related to whomever it is named for.
</P>
<P>
   _Lucille LeJeune
</P>
<P>
   A: You may be related to Maj. Gen. John A. Lejeune, leader of
the Second Division (Army) in World War I and major general
commandant of the Marine Corps from 1920 through 1929. Marine
Barracks New River in North Carolina was renamed Camp Lejeune at
the end of 1942. Born in Pointe Coupee, La., Lejeune graduated from
the U.S. Naval Academy in 1888. Lejeune's Marine career began in
1890.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What ever happened to that wonderful actor Gardner McKay, who
was on ``Adventures in Paradise?''
</P>
<P>
   _Polly N.
</P>
<P>
   A: Captain Adam Troy, Korean War vet and trouble-shooter, sailed
the ocean blue in the Tiki III from 1959-62. If the Pacific had a
Route 66, Troy would have been on it _ sailing from adventure to
adventure. McKay, ne George Cadogan Gardiner McKay, is a
playwright, winner of several National Endowment for the Arts
grants and a Drama Critics Circle Award. His novel, ``Toyer,'' is
available in area bookstores such as Barnes and Noble.
</P>
<P>
   Write to the skipper/teacher/sculptor and raiser of African
lions in care of his publisher, Little, Brown and Co., 1271 Avenue
of the Americas, New York, N.Y. 10020.
</P>
<P>
   Q: This summer I am traveling through Canada with my best friend
and her parents' carnival. I am interested in buying a pet hedgehog
to take with me. I know that hedgehogs are legal in Canada (except
Quebec _ where I am not going). Will I be allowed to cross the
border with my pet? I will be in Canada about a month and plan to
keep the hedgehog in my house trailer. I need to know whether to
buy my hedgehog now or after the summer is over! _E.M.
</P>
<P>
   A: Dr. Rod Livingstone of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency
(it regulates animals in and out of the land of the maple leaf)
says the hedgehog may enter the country as a pet without any
problems _ no proof of vaccinations, etc. Hedgehog travel from some
countries into Canada is restricted when there is reason to believe
disease may be carried by the animal. However, you do need an
import permit to bring your pet back into the United States. Call
the U.S. Department of Agriculture at (301) 734-8364 to arrange for
a permit.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Basically the only thing needed to perpetrate I.D. fraud is
your name, Social Security number and a valid mailing address. I
have to give my Social Security number to my employer. Who else
must I give it to? What basis do I have for turning down a request?
_D.K.W.
</P>
<P>
   A: According to Social Security spokeswoman Sandra Talbot,
``Giving your Social Security number is voluntary, even when you
are asked for the number directly. You can refuse.'' Some
businesses see it as an easy, unique number to use for record
keeping without realizing the danger of identity theft. If your
number is requested, Talbot advises you ask why it is needed; how
it is going to be used; what law requires you to give the number;
and what the consequences are if you refuse. Sometimes there is a
way around using the number; sometimes not, as in the issuance of a
Texas driver's license.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Wilkinson Sword Company of England made the first and, in
my opinion, the best stainless steel razor blades. I have been
unable to locate them lately. Could you find a local source? _Jack
Jennings
</P>
<P>
   A: Nope. Wilkinson _ at least in the United States and Canada _
is now Schick. Call (800) SHAVERS to describe the razor you have
and find out which Schick product will work with it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can a 26-year-old like me get a chance to play pro
football _ like the NFL or something? Who would I contact? I have
been out of high school nine years and don't plan on going to any
major colleges. Would that count against me? _David V.
</P>
<P>
   A: Have any game tapes? If so, you might be asked to try out for
Austin's first indoor football team, the Texas Terminators, says
president Jeff Parnell. Send the tape to 609 W. Sixth St., Suite B,
78701. Best-case scenario, you could be on the field in a matter of
days. This is a great place for the NFL scouts to ``discover'' you.
Parnell warns would-be football players, ``Lots of guys look good
in a T-shirt and shorts, but we want to see what you can do in
pads.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could you help me find a copy of Johnny Carson's last show?
We have three tapes of early years but not the last show. We miss
Johnny. _Tommie P.
</P>
<P>
   A: The final show, ``America Says Farewell,'' is no longer
available by itself. It is part of a set of retrospective shows. To
order ($44.99), call Movies Unlimited at (800) 523-0823. Carson was
not always the king of late night. His other television shows
included Sunday afternoon's ``Carson's Cellar,'' a short-lived CBS
show called ``The Johnny Carson Show,'' the forgettable ``Earn Your
Vacation,'' a stint as a substitute host for Jack Paar and a host
for the game show ``Who Do You Trust?'' Contact Jane Greig, author
of ``Thanks for Asking,'' at P.O. Box 670, Austin, TX, 78767; (512)
445-3697; e-mail jgreig(at)statesman.com or fax (512) 445-3968.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane S. Greig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: Please tell me how round toothpicks are made. I can imagine
little men standing before little lathes, yet I can't quite accept
that vision. _Jim Reece
</P>
<P>
   A: Here is the lowdown from Diamond Brands _ parent company of
toothpick giant Forster. Forster makes 7.2 billion toothpicks per
year. One-hundred-inch birch logs are cut into blocks which are
cooked with raw steam and veneered with a lathe. Veneered wood
sheets are processed in a dryer to remove moisture, cut into card
sizes and fed into a molding machine, which makes 12,000 round
dowels per minute! The dowels are then polished and pointed. The
final step is a shaker machine that packs 250 round toothpicks in a
box _ one box per second. Tomorrow, class _ how they make flat
toothpicks, which outsell round ones. Who brought America this oral
gratification device for adult men in pickups? Charles Forster in
1869, after noticing Brazilians whittling toothpicks from orange
trees. Until that time toothpicks were nondisposable items. To get
the idea across, Forster hired young men to demand disposable
toothpicks in restaurants all over Boston. Q: I have a request from
a German exchange student. Can you locate a Duke University
basketball jersey for him? _Eric Anderson
</P>
<P>
   A: Sure he doesn't want a UConn one instead? Order Duke Blue
Devil team wear _ golf shirts to shorts to volleyball T-shirts _ by
calling (800) VIA-DUKE. Basketball jerseys (royal/white,
reversible) are $25.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Last summer I had twins and my first cousin had quads. We
were talking about how we are all related. I think that I am her
children's second cousin and that our children are third cousins.
She thinks that she is my children's second cousin and that our
children are first cousins once removed. What is it? Would you
explain how someone is related once or twice removed? _Monica
Carlson
</P>
<P>
   A: Your children and her children are second cousins, says
genealogy whiz Erna Martin at the Texas State Library and Archives.
And your relationship to the quads? First cousin, once removed.
Here is the system for relationships in a nutshell: Find the
ancestor common to two people. The common ancestor is ``zero.''
Count down the generations to the subjects you are defining (in
this case, you're No. 2 from the common ancestor and your cousin's
quads are No. 3). Subtract one from the smaller number of
generations (No. 2 minus 1) to establish the cousin relationship.
Voila! First cousins. Next, subtract the smaller number of
generations from the larger number (No. 3 minus No. 2) to yield
``times removed.'' Thus, you're first cousins once removed. Too
much to remember? Send me a stamped, self-addressed envelope for a
copy of the ``Relationship Chart,'' which does the work for you _ a
fill-in-the-blank for first through seventh cousins and even those
pesky fourth cousins, three times removed.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the best way to get my credit report? _Carol Jennings
</P>
<P>
   A: Credit reports are available from three bureaus, and all
charge for the reports. Fees are waved for residents of some states
(not Texas) and for those who have been denied credit, insurance,
employment or rental housing based on an incorrect report; the
unemployed seeking employment; or victims of fraud. The three

<P>
   Q: I need your readers' help! I substitute in area elementaries
and teachers are glad for me to help students learn to collect
stamps. I did this for years when I had my own classroom. Would
readers be willing to tear the canceled stamped corners of their
mail and put them in an envelope to me? _Pam Binder
</P>
<P>
   A: Easy way to encourage young philatelists, readers. Send
canceled stamps to Binder's Stampfinders, 9605 Gambels Quail Drive,
Austin 78758-6224.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know you can take metal mini-blinds outside and wash them
down with a hose but I have two-inch, white, wooden blinds in my
home. How do I clean these? They are really dusty. If I water-hosed
them down on a sunny day when they would dry quickly, would I be
doing them any harm? Also what can I use to clean the white plastic
patio furniture? It got really dirty over the winter and nothing
seems to get it white again. _Linda Rives
</P>
<P>
   A: Do not use water on wood. Drapery and blind expert Candy
McWilliams at ABC Blind and Drapery says the only way to get them
clean is to vacuum the blinds and then wipe each slat individually.
That is what they do for the wood blinds on display. The patio
furniture should respond to either a power sprayer or hand washing
with bleach and water (about one cup bleach to six cups water). A
good scrub brush and patience usually works. Q: Suddenly, all my
wife's gold rings _ college ring, wedding band, special rings, all
14K gold _ have started to stain her fingers as if the darn things
were made of brass. This problem shows up intermittently and is
somewhat embarrassing to her. Is she secreting (if that's the
proper word) some chemical causing this problem?
</P>
<P>
   _J. Johnson
</P>
<P>
   A: Your wife's body chemistry may have changed, says Austin
jeweler Benard Laves. She may be reacting to a metal used in 14K
gold _ nickel, copper or zinc. Dr. Eugene Schoch Jr. advises your
wife to get a general physical checkup to see how/if her body
chemistry has changed and to look at the medications she is taking.
As long as her general health is good there is no reason to believe
this is a sign of anything serious _ just an inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where did Camp Lejeune gets its name? I think I may be
related to whomever it is named for.
</P>
<P>
   _Lucille LeJeune
</P>
<P>
   A: You may be related to Maj. Gen. John A. Lejeune, leader of
the Second Division (Army) in World War I and major general
commandant of the Marine Corps from 1920 through 1929. Marine
Barracks New River in North Carolina was renamed Camp Lejeune at
the end of 1942. Born in Pointe Coupee, La., Lejeune graduated from
the U.S. Naval Academy in 1888. Lejeune's Marine career began in
1890.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What ever happened to that wonderful actor Gardner McKay, who
was on ``Adventures in Paradise?''
</P>
<P>
   _Polly N.
</P>
<P>
   A: Captain Adam Troy, Korean War vet and trouble-shooter, sailed
the ocean blue in the Tiki III from 1959-62. If the Pacific had a
Route 66, Troy would have been on it _ sailing from adventure to
adventure. McKay, ne George Cadogan Gardiner McKay, is a
playwright, winner of several National Endowment for the Arts
grants and a Drama Critics Circle Award. His novel, ``Toyer,'' is
available in area bookstores such as Barnes and Noble.
</P>
<P>
   Write to the skipper/teacher/sculptor and raiser of African
lions in care of his publisher, Little, Brown and Co., 1271 Avenue
of the Americas, New York, N.Y. 10020.
</P>
<P>
   Q: This summer I am traveling through Canada with my best friend
and her parents' carnival. I am interested in buying a pet hedgehog
to take with me. I know that hedgehogs are legal in Canada (except
Quebec _ where I am not going). Will I be allowed to cross the
border with my pet? I will be in Canada about a month and plan to
keep the hedgehog in my house trailer. I need to know whether to
buy my hedgehog now or after the summer is over! _E.M.
</P>
<P>
   A: Dr. Rod Livingstone of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency
(it regulates animals in and out of the land of the maple leaf)
says the hedgehog may enter the country as a pet without any
problems _ no proof of vaccinations, etc. Hedgehog travel from some
countries into Canada is restricted when there is reason to believe
disease may be carried by the animal. However, you do need an
import permit to bring your pet back into the United States. Call
the U.S. Department of Agriculture at (301) 734-8364 to arrange for
a permit.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Basically the only thing needed to perpetrate I.D. fraud is
your name, Social Security number and a valid mailing address. I
have to give my Social Security number to my employer. Who else
must I give it to? What basis do I have for turning down a request?
_D.K.W.
</P>
<P>
   A: According to Social Security spokeswoman Sandra Talbot,
``Giving your Social Security number is voluntary, even when you
are asked for the number directly. You can refuse.'' Some
businesses see it as an easy, unique number to use for record
keeping without realizing the danger of identity theft. If your
number is requested, Talbot advises you ask why it is needed; how
it is going to be used; what law requires you to give the number;
and what the consequences are if you refuse. Sometimes there is a
way around using the number; sometimes not, as in the issuance of a
Texas driver's license.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Wilkinson Sword Company of England made the first and, in
my opinion, the best stainless steel razor blades. I have been
unable to locate them lately. Could you find a local source? _Jack
Jennings
</P>
<P>
   A: Nope. Wilkinson _ at least in the United States and Canada _
is now Schick. Call (800) SHAVERS to describe the razor you have
and find out which Schick product will work with it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can a 26-year-old like me get a chance to play pro
football _ like the NFL or something? Who would I contact? I have
been out of high school nine years and don't plan on going to any
major colleges. Would that count against me? _David V.
</P>
<P>
   A: Have any game tapes? If so, you might be asked to try out for
Austin's first indoor football team, the Texas Terminators, says
president Jeff Parnell. Send the tape to 609 W. Sixth St., Suite B,
78701. Best-case scenario, you could be on the field in a matter of
days. This is a great place for the NFL scouts to ``discover'' you.
Parnell warns would-be football players, ``Lots of guys look good
in a T-shirt and shorts, but we want to see what you can do in
pads.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could you help me find a copy of Johnny Carson's last show?
We have three tapes of early years but not the last show. We miss
Johnny. _Tommie P.
</P>
<P>
   A: The final show, ``America Says Farewell,'' is no longer
available by itself. It is part of a set of retrospective shows. To
order ($44.99), call Movies Unlimited at (800) 523-0823. Carson was
not always the king of late night. His other television shows
included Sunday afternoon's ``Carson's Cellar,'' a short-lived CBS
show called ``The Johnny Carson Show,'' the forgettable ``Earn Your
Vacation,'' a stint as a substitute host for Jack Paar and a host
for the game show ``Who Do You Trust?'' Contact Jane Greig, author
of ``Thanks for Asking,'' at P.O. Box 670, Austin, TX, 78767; (512)
445-3697; e-mail jgreig(at)statesman.com or fax (512) 445-3968.

 &HT;    Casting Net can turn up a sea of fishing info
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Think of it as a fish Net.
</P>
<P>
   For a fisherman, the Internet is almost as handy as a good
source of red wiggler worms or a lifetime supply of Red Coachman
flies. And now that it's spring, many of us will leave the ghostly
light of the computer monitor for some time spent in the sunshine
on a river or lake.
</P>
<P>
   Let's take a look at some of the fishing information you can
find on the Web. Since this column is produced in Georgia, we'll
also look at some sites that offer specific help for here. Don't be
discouraged if you live in another state. A few minutes with a
search engine such as AltaVista or Yahoo! will produce plenty of
localized fishing sites.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to fishing, all of us are beginners. Even if you
know a lot about trout fishing, you may not know beans about
catching bluegill bream. A bass expert may be able to cite chapter
and verse on the various plastic worms available but be mystified
when it comes time to head north for a vacation fishing trip for
walleyes.
</P>
<P>
   So we'll start with a page called the Fishing Network at
www.the-fishing-network
</P>
<P>
   .com/. This is a terrific site because _ like a good tackle box
_ it contains almost everything you'll need. There are sections
that offer specific fishing advice for the various species of
freshwater fish; weather forecasts; chat areas where you can tell
your fishing story to someone who actually would like to hear it;
information on records (that way you'll know if that big bream is a
world-record-sized catch); calendars of outdoor and fishing
expositions and shows; and even a nice selection of fishing clip
art if you'd like to decorate a Web page or just add a picture of a
fish to an e-mail or newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Now that you have gathered some information, you'll want to get
a fishing license. After all, the money you spend for the license
will be used to stock the rivers and lakes, so it's money well
spent. Besides, those who don't have a license can find that the
fines make for a very expensive trip.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, you can get all the information you need about
licenses and fishing regulations at a Web site run by the state at
www.dnr.state.ga.us/dnr/wild
</P>
<P>
   /fishingreg/. You'll find out, for example, when the season
starts for various types of fish and how many you're allowed to
catch. And, for those who want to try fishing but are reluctant to
buy a license, go to www.dnr.state.ga
</P>
<P>
   .us/dnr/wild/fishingreg/freefish
</P>
<P>
   .html and find out about ``free fishing days'' in Georgia when
no license or trout stamp is required.
</P>
<P>
   Next you'll want to find out where the fish are biting. A good
source for Georgia information is located at www.wmi.org
</P>
<P>
   /bassfish/reports/GEORGIA/. You'll find a complete list of
lakes. Click on the place that interests you, and you'll get a good
report. Each report is dated, so you'll know how recent the
information is. (If you live in another state, try www.wmi.org
</P>
<P>
   /bassfish/reports/ and check to see if your state is listed so
that you can get the same type of information.)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if you really want to put your computer to work as a
fishing buddy, you can download a program that offers you advice.
You'll enter information about the weather, time of year, species
of fish and then get help from the program. You can download a free
demonstration version of the program at ourworld
</P>
<P>
   .compuserve.com/homepages
</P>
<P>
   /strattech/fishexpe.htm (look for the link at the very bottom of
the page). Or you can order the commercial version of the program
for $26.

 &HT;    Apple's OS 8.6 called `incredibly stable'
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Apple Computer is readying the latest version of its
operating system. Called 8.6, this version of the Mac's OS is
expected to be released _ probably for free _ later this month or
in early May.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing earth-shaking in 8.6, but this version
represents a steady improvement. Indeed, the release alone shows
Apple Computer's newfound stability. The company has systematically
released OS upgrades every six months for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer is not saying anything official yet about OS 8.6,
but the Internet is filled with news about it. Here are some of the
more important improvements, gleaned from credible sources such as
MacWeek and MacOS World.
</P>
<P>
   OS 8.6's new features include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Better multitasking. Multitasking is the ability to perform
several functions at once, such as emptying the trash and copying
files. The Mac already can handle some multitasking, but Apple
Computer will now let users launch applications while their Macs
empty the trash with 8.6.
</P>
<P>
   _ Better system stability. The current system, 8.5, has plagued
some users with random and inexplicable crashes. The bugs that
caused these crashes have been fixed. Beta testers have reported
that 8.6 is ``incredibly stable.''
</P>
<P>
   _ New Sherlock interface. Sherlock is Apple Computer's new
search technology, which scans not only within files but also
across the Internet. In OS 8.6, Sherlock's window listing plug-ins
is now resizable.
</P>
<P>
   _ New Start-Up Control Panel. Apple Computer has rewritten this
mini-program so that it easily lets you connect to a server and a
network.
</P>
<P>
   _ Improved internal codes. Apple Computer has updated many of
its internal parts with 8.6. Among the things improved are video
drivers, laserwriter software, DVD software, Open Transport,
AppleScript and FireWire video drivers.
</P>
<P>
   While no particular item is big, all these small improvements
will add up to a lot in 8.6.
</P>
<P>
   And 8.6 is a big step forward to Apple Computer's next major
release, called OS X. OS X is Apple's answer to Microsoft's
powerful Windows NT software.
</P>
<P>
   The company says OS X will run preemptive multitasking. It will
also offer protected memory, advanced virtual memory and
multithreading.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago no one would have believed Apple could pull off OS
X. After all, it had failed to pull off two previous major system
upgrades. But there's great confidence in Apple, given its return
to profitability and success in rolling out system maintenance
upgrades such as 8.6.

 &HT;    Salon brings depth to Kosovo coverage
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``The cruelty is unimaginable,'' writes Laura Rozen,
who is covering the war in Yugoslavia from nearby Macedonia for
online Webzine Salon.com. Rozen is an excellent storyteller, and
her reports of the tragedy of the Kosovars _ businessmen,
secretaries, housewives, blue-collar workers and schoolchildren
suddenly stripped of everything but the clothes on their backs _
are riveting.
</P>
<P>
   It's a must-read for those who want to go beyond political
posturing and understand what really is happening to the displaced
people of Kosovo and the bomb-weary residents of Belgrade
(www.salon.com/news
</P>
<P>
   /feature/1999/04/05/kosovo/).
</P>
<P>
   Salon's coverage of the war in Yugoslavia has a breadth and
depth unexpected of a nontraditional, Web-only publication. While
Rozen reports from the scene, Joe Conason stays home, but wonders
why potential presidential candidate George W. Bush hasn't taken a
stand on the NATO bombings in an article called ``The Wobblers''
(www.salonmagazine.com/news/col/cona/1999/04/06/conason/).
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush's nervous failure to take a stand on the most pressing
question of the moment recalls Margaret Thatcher's admonition to
his dad, George Sr., when hostilities started in the Persian Gulf:
`Don't go wobbly on me now,''' Conason writes. ``Bush's wobbling on
Kosovo is the inevitable product of his urge to please all factions
in his divided party.''
</P>
<P>
   This news coverage is a strong showing from Salon, which stormed
its way into the Web news business last year with sensational and,
some say, biased coverage of the Clinton sex scandal and its
30-year-old revelations of an affair by Rep. Henry Hyde, chairman
of the committee conducting the presidential inquiry. Now the site
ranks in the top 500 most popular sites on the Web and seems to
have reporters doing real reporting from every corner and every
angle of the Kosovo story.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo coverage is just another high point in what's been a
pretty big week for Salon. First, founder and CEO David Talbot
finally wrestled away the Salon.com Web address with a promise of
stock and an undisclosed payment to Roy Frederickson, owner of two
beauty salons in Austin, Texas, who had hoped to develop a portal
for the hairdressing industry. Previously, the 1.2 million monthly
Salon junkies have been getting to the site by bookmarking
Salonmagazine.com or salon.net or salon1999.com, the address the
site launched with in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Salon took over the Salon.com address Monday (4/5) and launched
a redesigned site that separated content into areas including news,
arts, technology, health, books and the popular ``Mothers Who
Think.''
</P>
<P>
   This one small shift makes stories easy to find. And the stories
are worth finding whether it's breaking news about Yugoslavia, or
David Ratoff, or Michelle Goldman deconstructing Gwyneth Paltrow.
Salon seems have its pulse on what people are talking about,
thinking about, wondering about or might actually be doing, as is
the case of Thomas Scolville's workplace serial ``Silicon Follies''
(www.salon.com/21st/follies/about/about.html).
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a medium for New Yorker-type content. It's a
medium for newspaper-type content,'' Talbot has said. ``What the
Web is mostly known for at this point is cud-chewing punditry.
That's fine. It's a good medium for that. We decided we want to go
beyond that and start breaking stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Talbot says he knows his boutique publication can't compete with
massive newsgathering organizations such as CNN or MSNBC, but as
Talbot's staff continues to go where the news and pop culture are
heading, he may have also unwittingly found the secret to making
content profitable.
</P>
<P>
   To paraphrase James Carville: It's the interactivity, stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Salon's stable of ``cud-chewing pundits,'' who write for the
magazine, combined with the ``cud-chewing pundits'' who post
messages to Salon's Table Talk and who log onto one or more of the
200 discussion groups on the Well, the celebrated online community
Salon acquired Wednesday, could really make Salon a salon. The
artists, writers, technology geeks, academic types and other deep
thinkers who populate the Well will now be able to ``chew their
cud,'' about the news and trends of the day _ the same topics so
comprehensively covered in Salon.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Salon nor the Well will say just how Salon will
integrate it on the Web _ if it plans to integrate it at all. But a
few carefully placed links on the Well site could attract just the
sort of sophisticated, Web-savvy readers Salon covets. They're
exactly the type who might pony up $25 to become Salon members,
too.
</P>
<P>
   With the acquisition of the Well, Salon may be on its way to
having it all _ content, community and commerce. It's a combination
readers on Main Street and investors on Wall Street may find
irresistible. So, keep an eye out for those war dispatches _ and an
initial public offering.

 &HT;    Pokemon portable video game popping up everywhere
 &HT;    By Jennifer Hill
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Move over, Beanie Babies. Pokemon have seized the day.
And like those cuddly, stuffed, fabled toys of yesterday's trend,
there's seemingly a million of 'em.
</P>
<P>
   If you've heard your children talking about Squirtles and
Charizards, your household has been hit by the Pokemon bug. Since
hitting the U.S. market in September 1998, Nintendo has sold 1.5
million units, making it the fastest-selling Gameboy game ever.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Gameboy's portability, the game is played everywhere
from morning school carpools to playgrounds or any other place a
spare moment opens up. Where only a few months ago clusters of boys
put wildly colored plastic yo-yos through their paces, now many of
those same boys are huddled playing Pokemon.
</P>
<P>
   In the peculiar culture of video games, proximity can serve as
interaction. That is to say, two, three or four boys can all be
playing individual Gameboys but be communing with one another. But
with Pokemon, you advance your game by linking with another
player's Gameboy to trade Pokemon. Plus, you can also use the game
link cable to battle other players. (Of course, to do this you need
a game link cable, which costs about $10.)
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the parental purse, Nintendo makes two
versions of the game _ Red and Blue. Each game, which sells for
about $29, has a slightly different subset of the 150 different
Pokemon. So to collect all 150, you have to trade by linking up
with another player who has the other version of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The object of the game is to find, train, collect and use the
Pokemon in battle with other Pokemon trainers. When your Pokemon
defeats another in battle, you capture it and add it to your
collection.
</P>
<P>
   When you train your Pokemon, they evolve from lovable little
critters to larger and mostly still lovable creatures with a
variety of powers. For example, Squirtle evolves into Wartortle and
ultimately Blastoise. (Certainly makes your wonder if the author of
the American version names grew up in the Bronx, doesn't it?)
Depending on how they are trained, two Pokemon of the same type
could end up having different abilities in their full-grown state.
</P>
<P>
   The Pokemon onslaught shows no sign of slowing down. Episodes of
a cartoon show feature two-dimensional characters that only game
fanatics would know and love. According to Nintendo, the Pokemon
animated cartoon series is the top syndicated kids show in all
major U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
   And as if 150 Pokemon weren't enough, there are more video
versions to come featuring new critters. Nintendo plans to release
``Pokemon Pinball'' for Gameboy and ``Pokemon Snap'' for N64 in
late June. Japanese versions are already available.
</P>
<P>
   Pokemon trading cards, which appeared a few months ago, are
being snapped up with the same frenzy as Magic cards were in their
heyday. More than 50 million have been sold since December.
Currently, a yellow Volkswagen Beetle made up to like Pikachu, a
round yellow Pokemon that looks like a vertically challenged
relative of the Pillsbury Doughboy with tail, is making its way
across the country attending Pokemon trading card events.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro, the toymaker, has weighed in with collectible toys
featuring the Pokemon characters.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the Internet is a part of the Pokemon craze.
In addition to official Nintendo sites www.pokemon.com/ and
www.nintendo.com/gb/pokemon/index.html, there are scores of sites
maintained by game devotees. One such site, Pikachu Centre at
www.nintendo.com/gb/pokemon/index.html, has a wealth of information
about the current as well upcoming and Japanese versions of the
games.
</P>
<P>
   Having a hard time capturing the Tauros Pokemon? Many of these
sites features tips sent in by other gamers on everything from
training Pokemon faster to help finding the rarest Pokemon.
</P>
<P>
   The expected June release of the new games will likely breath
new life into the game's popularity, ensuring its fans will take
the game's slogan to heart _ ``Got to catch 'em all.''

 &HT;    Windows looks at 15 common PC problems
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Computers and operating systems break down all too
often. Now you can find solutions to some problems in the April
issue of Windows magazine. Its cover story is devoted to fixing 15
common PC problems. You'll find suggestions on how to fix scanners
that don't scan, sleeping computers that don't wake up and random
system hang-ups.
</P>
<P>
   The April issue of Windows also includes a preview of the coming
upgrade of WordPerfect Office Suite, the biggest competitor to
Microsoft Office. Windows gives WordPerfect Office a generally
thumbs up review. It says maker Corel has focused on making the
program easier to use. There are a couple of new features, such as
one that lets you preview a change in style before making it
permanent in a document.

   Springtime is academic test time, and there's some new software
out to help kids prepare. Emergency Prep is a computer CD that
offers a crash course in preparing for college admission tests.
It's a one-week course that claims to offer techniques for educated
guessing as well as time-saving strategies. Emergency Prep is
published by Kaplan, the leader in test preparation courses, and
Knowledge Adventure. It's available for both Macs and PCs.

   You can command a futurist tank battleship in ``Thunder
Brigade,'' a new arcade-type game from Interactive Magic. In
``Thunder Brigade,'' you command a flying tank. It's well-armed and
highly mobile. You move across a dozen different planets, fighting
as a member of a freedom brigade. The bad guys are members of the
Halon Empire, described in the game as ``cruel warmongers.'' You
play as a member of the Earth Alliance, ``a highly disciplined and
well-equipped'' group of fighters.

</P>
<P>
   Here's a Web site that's different. NY-Taxi.com offers a tour of
the Big Apple _ from a cab driver's perspective. The site is based
on a popular new book, ``New York City From a Cab Driver's View.''
It's written by a real cab driver named Clever Da Silva. I kid you
not. You'll find this site at www.ny-taxi.com/.

 &HT;    Public Agenda well-informed
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Its tag line, the ``Journalist's Inside Source for
Public Opinion and Policy Analysis,'' might turn off any nonworking
journalist. But don't let it. The public opinion Web site is
worthwhile for anyone who enjoys informed debate.
</P>
<P>
   The contentious issues of our time are listed along the left
side of the opening page of the Web site, www.publicagenda.org. A
click on one, abortion, brings a list of options organized under
two sections: ``Understanding the Issue'' and ``Public Opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Understanding the Issue'' includes an overview of the topic,
including statistics and a history of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Notable &AMP; Newsworthy'' subsection offers links to recent
stories relevant to abortion, including stories about the hunt for
Eric Robert Rudolph in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Fact File'' subsection offers a litany of statistics. For
abortion, the stats include age groups, the number of weeks into
the pregnancy that the abortion takes place and the reasons women
give for having them.
</P>
<P>
   The subsection called ``Framing the Debate'' lays out the major
perspectives. In this case, it's ``respecting life,'' ``respecting
the right to choose'' and ``respecting differences.'' Another link,
``Sources and Resources,'' offers hyperlinks to other Web sites,
contacts, phone numbers and addresses for some of the organizations
that follow the issue, such as the American Civil Liberties Union
and the Alan Guttmacher Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The second section, ``Public Opinion,'' has links to stories on
major points of view on the topic. Also included is a discussion
about how to avoid misrepresenting some of the statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site is run by Public Agenda, a nonpartisan, nonprofit
public opinion research and education group based in New York City.
The organization was founded in 1975 by social scientist and author
Daniel Yankelovich and former Secretary of State Cyrus Vance.
</P>
<P>
   Public Agenda considers its mission to help leaders understand
the public's point of view on major policy issues and to help
citizens understand critical policy issues so they can make better
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   New color copiers
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard recently released a new round of digital color
copiers starting at $499.
</P>
<P>
   The HP Color Copier 160/170 is expected to sell for around $499.
The HP Color Copier 260/270 has a suggested retail price of $599.
The new copiers are sold at HP retailers.
</P>
<P>
   HP is gearing the copiers for the small-business market. The
copiers can copy color brochures, business presentations and
promotional materials. Small runs of color marketing materials or
presentations can be copied for 10 cents per copy, according to
Hewlett-Packard. The copiers handle up to 10 copies per minute.
</P>
<P>
   More information about the copiers is available at
www.hp.com/go/copiers.
</P>
<P>
   Check this calendar
</P>
<P>
   If your company or you are too financially conservative to
upgrade to the new line of full-service calendar software products,
there is a free version online.
</P>
<P>
   Jintek's ScheduleOnline is geared for the small to midsize
businesses. The calendar is available at www.scheduleonline.com.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego-based company is billing itself as the intranet
solution for organizations without the resources to get or run
full-service software applications. Intranets are private
Internets.
</P>
<P>
   The calendar functions let users maintain personal calendars,
set up meetings within their organizations and check for schedule
conflicts. If a user picks a specific date for an appointment, the
calendar function offers the choice of automatically sending an
invitation e-mail to attendees.
</P>
<P>
   PC Magazine said of ScheduleOnline: ``Ideal for organizations
needing to manage their people, places and things, ScheduleOnline
is fast and highly functional. ... Groups seeking online management
assistance should start by looking at this elegant and useful
site.''

 &HT;    First-aid kit can help you survive computer crash
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Back when I owned a 1968 MG-B _ when gasoline was 29
cents a gallon and nerds owned slide rules instead of computers _ I
could keep my car running myself.
</P>
<P>
   All that was required was a moderate amount of bravery, socket
wrenches and a bank account that was deposited in a half-gallon
wine jar. But as time passed, cars got more sophisticated with
computers that monitor and control the engine, fuel injection
systems and electronic modules that are meant to be replaced, not
fixed.
</P>
<P>
   It is the same with computers. When I started out, we not only
fixed our own computers, we built them. The computer programs, in
those earliest days, were written in a language called BASIC, and
software stores didn't exist. Instead, we created our own programs
by typing in computer code (often copied directly from one of the
early computer magazines).
</P>
<P>
   Even with all that, computers were fairly easy to understand and
fix. There were two big factors going for us. For one, we knew
something about the computer since we built it with chips,
resistors and late-night curses. For another, it was a relatively
simple beast, like that old MG-B of mine.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, computers are so complex that most of us are way over
our heads when it comes to working on them. Besides, today's users
are very different from the earliest computer enthusiasts. The
computer is now an appliance, and just as most of us don't expect
to be able to work on a refrigerator, few users have much interest
in learning how the thing works.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, there are a few things you can do yourself to
protect your computer against future troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with a crash recovery disk. You'll need it if your
computer takes a page from the behavior of that old MG-B and
refuses to start one day. There are a lot of possible reasons for
that calamity, ranging from a hard disk with mechanical problems to
conflicts caused by installing a new device or software. You'll
eventually care about the cause, but _ before you can reach that
state _ you'll need to get the computer going. The crash recovery
disk bypasses the hard disk and any problems there and gets the
computer going.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, this is one case where that complex computer of yours
will make things easy. Just double click to open the Control Panel,
open up the Add/Remove Program icon and select the tab labeled
Startup Disk. Just follow the instructions you'll find there to
create the disk. Since space is limited and you'll find the process
fairly painless, we'll move on to the next item.
</P>
<P>
   Think of this step as creating a first-aid kit for your
computer. If you've ever had a computer disaster, you already know
how that can freeze your brain. The disk with the drivers for your
video card becomes impossible to find, the manual that you got with
your computer _ the very thing you need to work on the problem _
has disappeared. And you can't even find the right-size screwdriver
to open up the computer case.
</P>
<P>
   You can already see where I'm going. Find a small plastic box
and fill it with everything you'd need if your computer crashed.
Add the crash recovery disk you just made, all the manuals for your
computer and accessories, the Windows installation disk, and
screwdrivers to open up the machine as well as the disks you'd need
to reinstall your regular programs. Make sure you include
passwords, network settings and user names for your Internet
account.
</P>
<P>
   A prudent person would add a bottle of aspirin to that first-aid
kit. The aspirin won't help the computer, but you'll probably need
it.

 &HT;    USB camera ran afoul of immature technology
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Those of you who waded through the past couple of
episodes may have been left with the idea that the Philips USB PC
Camera, which provided me so many hours of gleeful entertainment,
is a total waste of time. That is not the case.
</P>
<P>
   I ran afoul of what we cognoscenti call ``immature technology.''
I had no sooner reached this conclusion than what should arrive but
an electronic message from a computer columnist at another large
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   He said he got a few chuckles at all the problems I had with
this little gadget, especially in light of the fact that he found
the Philips USB Camera to be very easy to install.
</P>
<P>
   I figured the curse of the Bus of Doom was already working on me
when he gallantly went on to say that he thought both views were
valid, and the culprit was the Universal Serial Bus its own self.
Its technology, in his opinion, was not yet mature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes to show that people should read more than one
review,'' he remarked. Amen.
</P>
<P>
   So the camera is one of those things that might work for you,
and then it might not. I imagine that the older your computer is,
the less likely it will be to work.
</P>
<P>
   Immature technology is something that was invented about the
same time as computers. It used to be, in the good old days, that
technology was allowed to mature in the laboratory before it was
inflicted upon the public. No longer. In the computer business, we
hop from one grand invention to another like a frog between lily
pads.
</P>
<P>
   Today's greatest thing since sliced bread will, in a year or so,
be replaced entirely by the greatest thing since the greatest thing
since sliced bread. What's more, we know it. Every year, Intel
produces a microprocessor many times faster than last year's. They
know they're going to do it. We know they're going to do it. The
question is, why can't they skip a few iterations, and then let us
slide happily along for a few years without having our computers
become obsolete before they get dusty?
</P>
<P>
   I don't really know. Trying to find out seems somehow like
asking Wotan why he decided to come down to Earth and start messing
with mortal women. But I suspect the applause of delighted
stockholders has something to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   Something like the Universal Serial Bus comes along, and
everyone has to figure out how to make something to plug into it.
But it takes some time, apparently, for everybody's USB to be the
same. When they are all the same, the technology is mature, and
will be ready to be rendered obsolete by something immature.
</P>
<P>
   It has always been thus.
</P>
<P>
   I can recall spending almost an entire day in the back room of a
computer store watching a very knowledgable salesman-technician
trying to make a 300-baud, state-of-the-art Hayes modem and
software work with my CP/M computer.
</P>
<P>
   The miserable thing wouldn't even take over the line and dial
for the first couple of hours. Somehow he got past the point of
dialing, but it wouldn't sustain a connection. It never would work.
</P>
<P>
   The store is gone now. So is Hayes. I know people who can talk
faster than a 300-baud modem could transmit data. But
communications technology is basically mature _ you plug your modem
into the receptacle with a little telephone icon beside it, plug
the phone line into the modem, turn on the computer, and the
chances are the computer will find the modem and set it up
automatically. Then the software will search for the modem, find
it, and set itself up. Not every time, but usually.

test score gains. But an Examiner analysis raises questions about
whether the gains are real or manipulated. By JULIAN GUTHRIE.
</P>
<P>
   LIFESTYLE/FEATURES (``l'' category)
</P>
<P>
   PEACE-STUDIES (Colonie, N.Y.) _ It's not necessary to get
arrested while studying peace. But it helps. Peace studies programs
flourish on 250 campuses nationwide, including Notre Dame, Syracuse
and Colgate. By ALAN WECHSLER
</P>
<P>
   PICTURE-SHOW (Canadian, Texas) _ The end was near for Main
Street's Palace Theatre, even with the nearest multiplex 100 miles
away. Then last year a businessman pumped nearly $1 million into
the decaying Palace, restoring it to its mid-century prime. But the
Palace is not an anomaly _ Texans have restored nearly 100
small-town theaters in the past two decades. By THADDEUS HERRICK.
</P>
<P>
   FOUR-POSTER-BEDS (Albany, N.Y.) _ Four-poster beds add an
elegant, eye-catching touch to any bedroom, whether the posts are
ornamented with a fabric tester and fabric curtains or not. The
popularity of this style of bed spans three centuries and
continues. By FRANCES INGRAHAM.
</P>
<P>
   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) Column on sweet potatoes. By KATHY
HUBER.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K-COMMUNITY (Glenmont, N.Y.) _ Some people are preparing for
Y2K _ the threat of computer problems when the calendar turns to
2000 _ by moving to the country and buying generators and guns. But
others are doing the opposite. In churches, in schools on campus or
in private homes, rather than causing panic, the threat of trouble
on New Year's, 2000, is bringing people together. By ALAN WECHSLER.
</P>
<P>
   AGING-BOOMERS (San Francisco) _ I just received another offer
for a newsletter on aging. It promises that if (and only if) I
subscribe, I will look better, feel better, enjoy life more and
generally be the terrific person they think I should be. What's
wrong with who I am now? Apparently, everything. By RUTH SHERMAN.
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT (``e'' category)
</P>
<P>
   TV-MIDWAY (Undated) _ The Battle for Midway in 1942 pitted
American against Japanese naval forces that clashed in the sea and
air over a spit of coral and sand 1,000 miles from nowhere. ``The
Battle for Midway,'' a National Geographic special airing Wednesday
on TBS, offers a compelling look at this great naval encounter. By
MARK McGUIRE.

   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Just a few years ago, I was a
champion at the San Francisco national sport of dining out. The
goal is to find a great restaurant before it's reviewed and the
food ghouls arrive, all ordering exactly the same things mentioned
in the review. Now I've moved on to a higher level of foodiedom. By
ROB MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   SALTER-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ The following quotations are
from news stories that have appeared since January. The italicized
paragraphs are from ``Shifting Fortunes: The Perils of the Growing
American Wealth Gap,'' published by the Boston-based organization,
United for a Fair Economy. By STEPHANIE SALTER.
</P>
<P>
   ROSENFELD-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ The fragility of the NATO
coalition grows, it seems, almost by the day as airplanes from the
alliance bomb ever more targets in Yugoslavia with perhaps marginal
effect to bring Slobodan Milosevic to heel. Second-guessing is
rampant. By HARRY ROSENFELD.
</P>
<P>
   ROBISON-COLUMN (Austin, Texas) Column on Texas politics. By CLAY
ROBISON.
</P>
<P>
   FLORES-COLUMN (San Antonio) _ Estelle Lawton, a public health
nurse supervisor, is no longer surprised to hear 50-year-old women
tell her they've never done a breast self-examination. The stresses
and cultural taboos faces by poor, minority women make them
particularly vulnerable to breast cancer. By VERONICA FLORES.

 &UR; (1,100 words and one 200-word sidebar) &QL; 
 &UR; By JARED DIAMOND &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In New Guinea's rain forest, environmentalists and business
executives are learning that what's good for this pristine world is
also good for the bottom line. The author, a professor of
physiology and an avid bird-watcher, makes his 17th visit to New
Guinea and discovers an elusive bird _ a cassowary _ living near
the oil fields. What makes it possible for this big, shy,
ostrichlike bird _ rarely found anywhere near the disturbances
people create _ to survive alongside the country's largest
operating oil and natural gas field?

   The author, an orthopedic surgeon in Berkeley, Calif., seeks to
cure a severe condition of developmental dysplasia found in a
3-year-old patient named Gabrielle. Can the child be saved from
what would become a life crippled by debilitating arthritis? After
two operations, body casts and leg braces, little Gabrielle finds
herself taking dance classes.

   In New Guinea's rain forest, environmentalists and business
executives are learning that what's good for this pristine world is
also good for the bottom line. The author, a professor of
physiology and an avid bird-watcher, makes his 17th visit to New
Guinea and discovers an elusive bird _ a cassowary _ living near
the oil fields. What makes it possible for this big, shy,
ostrichlike bird _ rarely found anywhere near the disturbances
people create _ to survive alongside the country's largest
operating oil and natural gas field?

<P>
   As the plane banked toward a dirt airstrip, I looked out on New
Guinea's tropical rain forest, biologically one of the richest
environments on Earth. Suddenly, this embodiment of beauty was
shattered by a column of burning gas flaring up from an oil field.
The heat withered nearby trees, a perfect metaphor for human
desecration of nature.
</P>
<P>
   Then something large moved near the oil field, and I was
astonished to see it was a cassowary. These big, shy, ostrichlike
flightless birds that depend on undamaged forest are rarely found
anywhere near the disturbances people create. How could such an
elusive bird survive 10 feet from that searing flare?
</P>
<P>
   I have been studying birds and exploring the biology of New
Guinea for 35 years. My most recent project took place along the
Kikori River within the nation of Papua New Guinea, which occupies
the eastern half of the island. A decade ago, the discovery of oil
threatened the remote paradise.
</P>
<P>
   A consortium of oil companies, called Joint Venture Partners,
runs New Guinea's largest operating oil and natural gas field along
the Kikori. It is managed by a subsidiary of Chevron. From wells
100 miles inland and as high up as 4,400 feet, a pipeline carries
oil to the Gulf of Papua, where it is pumped into tankers.
</P>
<P>
   Oil is not the only danger to this pristine rain forest. Much of
it is slated to be cut down for timber.
</P>
<P>
   I was wary before I left for this trip, but from the moment I
landed at the airstrip in Moro, the partnership's headquarters at
the inland end of the pipeline, we were in for constant surprises.
Private security guards working for the company began rummaging
through our luggage, checking for items forbidden in the
partnership's lease area _ drugs, alcohol, material deemed
pornographic and firearms and other weapons.
</P>
<P>
   After the search, we were welcomed to offices of Moro's World
Wildlife Fund _ a partner with Chevron to preserve the Kikori area.
Here we found comforts we were not used to in the outback:
air-conditioned rooms, e-mail and phone links, dinner in a
luxuriously stocked cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   Before sunrise the next morning, I grabbed my binoculars for a
little bird-watching. I didn't expect much, but within hearing and
sight of the camp _ and its gas flare _ I watched some of New
Guinea's shiest and most heavily hunted bird species, including
harpy eagles, vulturine parrots and birds of paradise. What were
these retiring denizens of the rain forest doing near manmade
structures?
</P>
<P>
   For the next month, I birded every day through the rain forest
that led all the way down to the sea along the pipeline. Hundreds
of feet above the road and the nearby Kikori flowed another river _
of birds in the sky. Near the oil camps and gas flares ventured not
only cassowaries and harpy eagles but every single one of the other
large, threatened bird species of the New Guinea lowlands.
</P>
<P>
   The fauna throughout the oil lease zone remains pristine because
the partnership keeps a tight rein on employees' activities.
Prohibitions on hunting, exporting animals and plants, collecting
any living thing, making gardens and cutting down trees minimizes
forest disturbance. The partnership also rigorously controls the
number of people who can come here, requiring company authorization
to arrive by plane.
</P>
<P>
   Why was the partnership so strict _ how were these rules
connected to making money? A bird-watching Chevron executive
offered one answer: ``Bhopal, Exxon Valdez and the North Sea oil
rig'' _ notorious industrial disasters that cost Union Carbide,
Exxon and Shell Oil billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership has cause to worry about its activities in New
Guinea. Chevron learned its lesson the hard way when it cleared a
small summit on Mount Sisa for a helipad, intending to erect a
radio relay station there. As soon as Huli tribesmen living around
the base of the mountain saw helicopters hovering there, they began
climbing. On reaching the helipad, they introduced themselves and
announced their claim, demanding huge compensation for trespassing,
cutting trees and disturbing birds. Local Samberigi tribesmen later
hijacked chartered helicopters to enforce their demands. Faced with
lawsuits and bills for damages, Chevron abandoned the place.
</P>
<P>
   Similar considerations reinforced the partnership's desire to
keep environmental disturbances to a minimum. Local landowners also
get royalties on the oil pumped. The fees are a major source of
income for clans in the area. The partnership builds schools,
hospitals, roads and other public works at no cost.
</P>
<P>
   What I have witnessed along the Kikori has changed my mind about
the inevitability of environmental disaster when oil is pumped out
of the ground. But I worry about the other rivers I saw there,
rivers in the sky streaming constantly above me _ of birds, bats,
insects, spiders, seeds and pollen blown in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   As a bird-watcher, I was especially struck by the importance of
three components of the rivers. Most conspicuous were birds leaving
their roots daily to forage, or moving their roosts to track
seasonally shifting food supplies. Second were birds that hatch as
nestlings at one altitude, fly as juveniles to spend their early
years at some other altitude, then return as adults to build their
own nests and breed.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining bird movements were of individuals that disperse
only once in a lifetime, leaving their nest sites in search of new
breeding grounds. These movements are essential for maintaining
populations in habitats so small that they can support only one or
a few breeding pairs. For instance, I found a population of a high
altitude species otherwise missing in the conservation area _ the
superb bird of paradise. The population was just one adult male and
one female.
</P>
<P>
   All these movements of birds mean that a policy of landscape
management preserving only isolated pieces of natural habitat is
doomed to fail. The plant and animal populations in isolated
patches risk gradually going extinct unless a sea of natural
habitat surrounds and supports them. Instead, whole landscapes must
be preserved and managed.
</P>
<P>
   We have a model that may work: The oil partnership lease area
along the Kikori. It is the largest area of land rigidly controlled
and managed as an integrated entity in the country. Although the
reasons have to do with oil, not conservation, the requirements for
managing long subterranean oil pipelines have turned out to
coincide with the requirements for managing long aerial pipelines
of life.
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; SIDEBAR: TIME TO STOP CUTTING DOWN TREES AS FAST AS THEY GROW &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What's left of the world's forest is being logged at such a
breakneck pace that almost all the remaining tropical rain forests
in the world will be destroyed within 50 years. In some countries,
such as the Philippines and the Solomon Islands, they'll be gone
within a decade. Most logging operations are nonsustainable _ trees
are cut faster than they can regrow.
</P>
<P>
   What can be done to halt the juggernaut? One solution is a
benign cutting schedule, called eco-forestry, that attempts to
harvest trees no faster than new ones can grow to replace them.
</P>
<P>
   Because an increasing fraction of the buying public _ especially
in North America and Europe _ would prefer to buy responsibly
harvested timber products, logging companies increasingly label
their operations as sustainable.
</P>
<P>
   To certify such claims, a coalition of environmental groups,
indigenous peoples' groups and other interests have set up the
Forest Stewardship Council. Logging projects have now been
certified in 20 countries, and public response is so favorable that
the demand for certified timber products exceeds the supply.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Little Gabrielle, 3 years old, sat mutely on the examining
table. Her legs dangled over the edge, revealing a right knee that
protruded about an inch farther than the left.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can fix her, can't you, Doctor?'' her mother asked
anxiously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her pediatrician was very concerned,'' I said, evading the
question. In fact, her pediatrician had brought the X-rays straight
to my office door. Orthopedic surgery is rooted in a long tradition
of preventing deformity in children. (Orthopedics comes from two
Greek words meaning ``straight'' and ``child.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``When did you first notice something was wrong?'' I asked the
mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister noticed while watching a videotape we made at a
birthday party. Gaby was wearing shorts, and in one shot from the
back, I could see that her bottom was kind of tilted and that she
limped a little.''
</P>
<P>
   The X-ray suggested that the problem had developed gradually.
Gabrielle's right hip joint was perfectly normal, but the left hip
socket was enlarged and slightly shallow. Worse, the round head of
the femur wasn't centered in the socket but had slipped up toward
the outer edge.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrielle had a problem called developmental dysplasia, a
general term for a group of malformations in the hip joints of
children. Nobody knows what causes them. But early detection makes
dysplasia easier to treat.
</P>
<P>
   In this country, evaluation of the hips is an important part of
examining newborns. I had no way of knowing what Gabrielle's
examination had been like when she was a newborn. Most likely, she
had been born with slightly loose ligaments in her hips. As she
began to walk, and especially after she grew taller and heavier,
the increasing pressure on her hip joint would have caused the ball
of the femur to start slipping out of place. Eventually the ball
could work its way completely out of the socket. The hip would most
likely deteriorate, causing Gabrielle painful arthritis by the time
she was in her 30s.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrielle was easy to examine, but when she let me measure her
legs and move them through a range of motion, I noticed a slight
tightness in her left inner thigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not exactly an emergency,'' I told her mother, ``but I
want to bring Gabrielle into the hospital and get that hip back
where it belongs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Will she need surgery?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' I said. ``And there'll be some time in a cast too.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, Gabrielle was back in my examining room with
her family. I put up the X-ray, which easily showed the difference
between her two hip joints. The hard part was explaining the
treatment: A simple manipulation could possibly relocate the ball
in the socket, or I might have to perform an invasive operation to
clear away any tissue obstructing the socket. Either way, Gabrielle
would have to spend time in a cast stretching from her waist to her
ankle. Then she would have to wear a brace for at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of all this, the hip could migrate back out of the
socket, even years after surgery. That would mean another
operation, possibly cutting bone.
</P>
<P>
   After a moment, the father asked, ``Would all this have been
necessary if we had noticed it sooner?'' I told him we couldn't
know for certain.
</P>
<P>
   Gaby was admitted to the hospital a week later, and the cast
technician and I set up traction to draw her legs gently down and
apart, gradually stretching the soft tissue. In the operating room,
I could see that traction had helped. But with Gabrielle
anesthetized to allow her muscles to relax fully, the tendon in her
groin remained tight.
</P>
<P>
   So I made a tiny incision, and cut the tendon with a small
scalpel. That, I hoped, would free up movement in the joint. I
flexed and rotated her thigh until the ball appeared well seated in
the socket. I held Gabrielle's legs in position while the
technician applied the fiberglass cast that would stabilize her
hip.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrielle recovered easily from the anesthetic _ as children
usually do _ and was discharged. At her one-week post-op visit, her
X-rays looked fine. Five weeks later, a new set of X-rays showed
that the hip was still in good position, so we cut the cast down to
midthigh length.
</P>
<P>
   When the family came back for final cast removal, everyone's
spirits were high. Gaby held her mother's hand tightly as the loud,
buzzing cast saw cut away. She didn't cry or complain as the brace
was fitted. Then she headed home with her parents to celebrate _
and to take a bath.
</P>
<P>
   But when I saw the next X-ray three weeks later, my heart sank.
With the little extra motion allowed by the brace, and the stresses
of walking on the hip again, the ball had slipped right back to
where it had been before. I would have to go back to the operating
room.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrielle's parents read my face before I even started to speak.
``This is a setback,'' I said, ``not a disaster. We haven't lost
anything except a little time.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, I cut into the outer front of Gabrielle's left
hip. I separated layers of muscle and tendon down to the bag of
ligament and fibrous tissue that holds the joint together. I cut
away the thickened tissue and tightened the baggy upper part. When
I gently rotated Gaby's thigh inward, the ball fell into the socket
with no resistance. Then I held the hip where I wanted it while my
assistant put on the cast.
</P>
<P>
   Gaby was in her long cast for eight full weeks before she was
allowed to walk in a brace. She was as stiff as a board when I
finally let her spend a little time out of the brace, shortly after
her 4th birthday. Her X-rays continued to show a hip sitting
normally in the socket.
</P>
<P>
   Just before she started school, I examined Gaby again.
Everything looked great. ``Your daughter's not out of the woods
yet,'' I told her mother. ``She won't really be until her growth is
complete. I want to see her for new X-rays in three months, and
after that maybe we can go to every six months or a year between
visits.''
</P>
<P>
   I paused and took a deep breath. ``But I think she can stop
using the brace altogether now.''
</P>
<P>
   She smiled. I smiled. Gaby smiled, too, head down. ``Thank you,
Dr. Sussman,'' she said in a clear voice. I bent down and got a big
hug.

<P>
   Little Gabrielle, 3 years old, sat mutely on the examining
table. Her legs dangled over the edge, revealing a right knee that
protruded about an inch farther than the left.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can fix her, can't you, Doctor?'' her mother asked
anxiously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her pediatrician was very concerned,'' I said, evading the
question. In fact, her pediatrician had brought the X-rays straight
to my office door. Orthopedic surgery is rooted in a long tradition
of preventing deformity in children. (Orthopedics comes from two
Greek words meaning ``straight'' and ``child.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``When did you first notice something was wrong?'' I asked the
mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister noticed while watching a videotape we made at a
birthday party. Gaby was wearing shorts, and in one shot from the
back, I could see that her bottom was kind of tilted and that she
limped a little.''
</P>
<P>
   The X-ray suggested that the problem had developed gradually.
Gabrielle's right hip joint was perfectly normal, but the left hip
socket was enlarged and slightly shallow. Worse, the round head of
the femur wasn't centered in the socket but had slipped up toward
the outer edge.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrielle had a problem called developmental dysplasia, a
general term for a group of malformations in the hip joints of
children. Nobody knows what causes them. But early detection makes
dysplasia easier to treat.
</P>
<P>
   In this country, evaluation of the hips is an important part of
examining newborns. I had no way of knowing what Gabrielle's
examination had been like when she was a newborn. Most likely, she
had been born with slightly loose ligaments in her hips. As she
began to walk, and especially after she grew taller and heavier,
the increasing pressure on her hip joint would have caused the ball
of the femur to start slipping out of place. Eventually the ball
could work its way completely out of the socket. The hip would most
likely deteriorate, causing Gabrielle painful arthritis by the time
she was in her 30s.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrielle was easy to examine, but when she let me measure her
legs and move them through a range of motion, I noticed a slight
tightness in her left inner thigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not exactly an emergency,'' I told her mother, ``but I
want to bring Gabrielle into the hospital and get that hip back
where it belongs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Will she need surgery?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' I said. ``And there'll be some time in a cast too.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, Gabrielle was back in my examining room with
her family. I put up the X-ray, which easily showed the difference
between her two hip joints. The hard part was explaining the
treatment: A simple manipulation could possibly relocate the ball
in the socket, or I might have to perform an invasive operation to
clear away any tissue obstructing the socket. Either way, Gabrielle
would have to spend time in a cast stretching from her waist to her
ankle. Then she would have to wear a brace for at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of all this, the hip could migrate back out of the
socket, even years after surgery. That would mean another
operation, possibly cutting bone.
</P>
<P>
   After a moment, the father asked, ``Would all this have been
necessary if we had noticed it sooner?'' I told him we couldn't
know for certain.
</P>
<P>
   Gaby was admitted to the hospital a week later, and the cast
technician and I set up traction to draw her legs gently down and
apart, gradually stretching the soft tissue. In the operating room,
I could see that traction had helped. But with Gabrielle
anesthetized to allow her muscles to relax fully, the tendon in her
groin remained tight.
</P>
<P>
   So I made a tiny incision, and cut the tendon with a small
scalpel. That, I hoped, would free up movement in the joint. I
flexed and rotated her thigh until the ball appeared well seated in
the socket. I held Gabrielle's legs in position while the
technician applied the fiberglass cast that would stabilize her
hip.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrielle recovered easily from the anesthetic _ as children
usually do _ and was discharged. At her one-week post-op visit, her
X-rays looked fine. Five weeks later, a new set of X-rays showed
that the hip was still in good position, so we cut the cast down to
midthigh length.
</P>
<P>
   When the family came back for final cast removal, everyone's
spirits were high. Gaby held her mother's hand tightly as the loud,
buzzing cast saw cut away. She didn't cry or complain as the brace
was fitted. Then she headed home with her parents to celebrate _
and to take a bath.
</P>
<P>
   But when I saw the next X-ray three weeks later, my heart sank.
With the little extra motion allowed by the brace, and the stresses
of walking on the hip again, the ball had slipped right back to
where it had been before. I would have to go back to the operating
room.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrielle's parents read my face before I even started to speak.
``This is a setback,'' I said, ``not a disaster. We haven't lost
anything except a little time.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, I cut into the outer front of Gabrielle's left
hip. I separated layers of muscle and tendon down to the bag of
ligament and fibrous tissue that holds the joint together. I cut
away the thickened tissue and tightened the baggy upper part. When
I gently rotated Gaby's thigh inward, the ball fell into the socket
with no resistance. Then I held the hip where I wanted it while my
assistant put on the cast.
</P>
<P>
   Gaby was in her long cast for eight full weeks before she was
allowed to walk in a brace. She was as stiff as a board when I
finally let her spend a little time out of the brace, shortly after
her 4th birthday. Her X-rays continued to show a hip sitting
normally in the socket.
</P>
<P>
   Just before she started school, I examined Gaby again.
Everything looked great. ``Your daughter's not out of the woods

<P>
   As the plane banked toward a dirt airstrip, I looked out on New
Guinea's tropical rain forest, biologically one of the richest
environments on Earth. Suddenly, this embodiment of beauty was
shattered by a column of burning gas flaring up from an oil field.
The heat withered nearby trees, a perfect metaphor for human
desecration of nature.
</P>
<P>
   Then something large moved near the oil field, and I was
astonished to see it was a cassowary. These big, shy, ostrichlike
flightless birds that depend on undamaged forest are rarely found
anywhere near the disturbances people create. How could such an
elusive bird survive 10 feet from that searing flare?
</P>
<P>
   I have been studying birds and exploring the biology of New
Guinea for 35 years. My most recent project took place along the
Kikori River within the nation of Papua New Guinea, which occupies
the eastern half of the island. A decade ago, the discovery of oil
threatened the remote paradise.
</P>
<P>
   A consortium of oil companies, called Joint Venture Partners,
runs New Guinea's largest operating oil and natural gas field along
the Kikori. It is managed by a subsidiary of Chevron. From wells
100 miles inland and as high up as 4,400 feet, a pipeline carries
oil to the Gulf of Papua, where it is pumped into tankers.
</P>
<P>
   Oil is not the only danger to this pristine rain forest. Much of
it is slated to be cut down for timber.
</P>
<P>
   I was wary before I left for this trip, but from the moment I
landed at the airstrip in Moro, the partnership's headquarters at
the inland end of the pipeline, we were in for constant surprises.
Private security guards working for the company began rummaging
through our luggage, checking for items forbidden in the
partnership's lease area _ drugs, alcohol, material deemed
pornographic and firearms and other weapons.
</P>
<P>
   After the search, we were welcomed to offices of Moro's World
Wildlife Fund _ a partner with Chevron to preserve the Kikori area.
Here we found comforts we were not used to in the outback:
air-conditioned rooms, e-mail and phone links, dinner in a
luxuriously stocked cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   Before sunrise the next morning, I grabbed my binoculars for a
little bird-watching. I didn't expect much, but within hearing and
sight of the camp _ and its gas flare _ I watched some of New
Guinea's shiest and most heavily hunted bird species, including
harpy eagles, vulturine parrots and birds of paradise. What were
these retiring denizens of the rain forest doing near manmade
structures?
</P>
<P>
   For the next month, I birded every day through the rain forest
that led all the way down to the sea along the pipeline. Hundreds
of feet above the road and the nearby Kikori flowed another river _
of birds in the sky. Near the oil camps and gas flares ventured not
only cassowaries and harpy eagles but every single one of the other
large, threatened bird species of the New Guinea lowlands.
</P>
<P>
   The fauna throughout the oil lease zone remains pristine because
the partnership keeps a tight rein on employees' activities.
Prohibitions on hunting, exporting animals and plants, collecting
any living thing, making gardens and cutting down trees minimizes
forest disturbance. The partnership also rigorously controls the
number of people who can come here, requiring company authorization
to arrive by plane.
</P>
<P>
   Why was the partnership so strict _ how were these rules
connected to making money? A bird-watching Chevron executive
offered one answer: ``Bhopal, Exxon Valdez and the North Sea oil
rig'' _ notorious industrial disasters that cost Union Carbide,
Exxon and Shell Oil billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership has cause to worry about its activities in New
Guinea. Chevron learned its lesson the hard way when it cleared a
small summit on Mount Sisa for a helipad, intending to erect a
radio relay station there. As soon as Huli tribesmen living around
the base of the mountain saw helicopters hovering there, they began
climbing. On reaching the helipad, they introduced themselves and
announced their claim, demanding huge compensation for trespassing,
cutting trees and disturbing birds. Local Samberigi tribesmen later
hijacked chartered helicopters to enforce their demands. Faced with
lawsuits and bills for damages, Chevron abandoned the place.
</P>
<P>
   Similar considerations reinforced the partnership's desire to
keep environmental disturbances to a minimum. Local landowners also
get royalties on the oil pumped. The fees are a major source of
income for clans in the area. The partnership builds schools,
hospitals, roads and other public works at no cost.
</P>
<P>
   What I have witnessed along the Kikori has changed my mind about
the inevitability of environmental disaster when oil is pumped out
of the ground. But I worry about the other rivers I saw there,
rivers in the sky streaming constantly above me _ of birds, bats,
insects, spiders, seeds and pollen blown in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   As a bird-watcher, I was especially struck by the importance of
three components of the rivers. Most conspicuous were birds leaving
their roots daily to forage, or moving their roosts to track
seasonally shifting food supplies. Second were birds that hatch as
nestlings at one altitude, fly as juveniles to spend their early
years at some other altitude, then return as adults to build their
own nests and breed.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining bird movements were of individuals that disperse
only once in a lifetime, leaving their nest sites in search of new
breeding grounds. These movements are essential for maintaining
populations in habitats so small that they can support only one or
a few breeding pairs. For instance, I found a population of a high
altitude species otherwise missing in the conservation area _ the
superb bird of paradise. The population was just one adult male and
one female.
</P>
<P>
   All these movements of birds mean that a policy of landscape
management preserving only isolated pieces of natural habitat is
doomed to fail. The plant and animal populations in isolated
patches risk gradually going extinct unless a sea of natural
habitat surrounds and supports them. Instead, whole landscapes must
be preserved and managed.
</P>
<P>
   We have a model that may work: The oil partnership lease area
along the Kikori. It is the largest area of land rigidly controlled
and managed as an integrated entity in the country. Although the
reasons have to do with oil, not conservation, the requirements for
managing long subterranean oil pipelines have turned out to
coincide with the requirements for managing long aerial pipelines
of life.
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; SIDEBAR: TIME TO STOP CUTTING DOWN TREES AS FAST AS THEY GROW &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What's left of the world's forest is being logged at such a
breakneck pace that almost all the remaining tropical rain forests
in the world will be destroyed within 50 years. In some countries,
such as the Philippines and the Solomon Islands, they'll be gone
within a decade. Most logging operations are nonsustainable _ trees
are cut faster than they can regrow.
</P>
<P>
   What can be done to halt the juggernaut? One solution is a
benign cutting schedule, called eco-forestry, that attempts to
harvest trees no faster than new ones can grow to replace them.
</P>
<P>
   Because an increasing fraction of the buying public _ especially
in North America and Europe _ would prefer to buy responsibly
harvested timber products, logging companies increasingly label
their operations as sustainable.
</P>
<P>
   To certify such claims, a coalition of environmental groups,
indigenous peoples' groups and other interests have set up the
Forest Stewardship Council. Logging projects have now been
certified in 20 countries, and public response is so favorable that
the demand for certified timber products exceeds the supply.

<P>
   Little Gabrielle, 3 years old, sat mutely on the examining
table. Her legs dangled over the edge, revealing a right knee that
protruded about an inch farther than the left.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can fix her, can't you, Doctor?'' her mother asked
anxiously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her pediatrician was very concerned,'' I said, evading the
question. In fact, her pediatrician had brought the X-rays straight
to my office door. Orthopedic surgery is rooted in a long tradition
of preventing deformity in children. (Orthopedics comes from two
Greek words meaning ``straight'' and ``child.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``When did you first notice something was wrong?'' I asked the
mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister noticed while watching a videotape we made at a
birthday party. Gaby was wearing shorts, and in one shot from the
back, I could see that her bottom was kind of tilted and that she
limped a little.''
</P>
<P>
   The X-ray suggested that the problem had developed gradually.
Gabrielle's right hip joint was perfectly normal, but the left hip
socket was enlarged and slightly shallow. Worse, the round head of
the femur wasn't centered in the socket but had slipped up toward
the outer edge.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrielle had a problem called developmental dysplasia, a
general term for a group of malformations in the hip joints of
children. Nobody knows what causes them. But early detection makes
dysplasia easier to treat.
</P>
<P>
   In this country, evaluation of the hips is an important part of
examining newborns. I had no way of knowing what Gabrielle's
examination had been like when she was a newborn. Most likely, she
had been born with slightly loose ligaments in her hips. As she
began to walk, and especially after she grew taller and heavier,
the increasing pressure on her hip joint would have caused the ball
of the femur to start slipping out of place. Eventually the ball
could work its way completely out of the socket. The hip would most
likely deteriorate, causing Gabrielle painful arthritis by the time
she was in her 30s.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrielle was easy to examine, but when she let me measure her
legs and move them through a range of motion, I noticed a slight
tightness in her left inner thigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not exactly an emergency,'' I told her mother, ``but I
want to bring Gabrielle into the hospital and get that hip back
where it belongs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Will she need surgery?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' I said. ``And there'll be some time in a cast too.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, Gabrielle was back in my examining room with
her family. I put up the X-ray, which easily showed the difference
between her two hip joints. The hard part was explaining the
treatment: A simple manipulation could possibly relocate the ball
in the socket, or I might have to perform an invasive operation to
clear away any tissue obstructing the socket. Either way, Gabrielle
would have to spend time in a cast stretching from her waist to her
ankle. Then she would have to wear a brace for at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of all this, the hip could migrate back out of the
socket, even years after surgery. That would mean another
operation, possibly cutting bone.
</P>
<P>
   After a moment, the father asked, ``Would all this have been
necessary if we had noticed it sooner?'' I told him we couldn't
know for certain.
</P>
<P>
   Gaby was admitted to the hospital a week later, and the cast
technician and I set up traction to draw her legs gently down and
apart, gradually stretching the soft tissue. In the operating room,
I could see that traction had helped. But with Gabrielle
anesthetized to allow her muscles to relax fully, the tendon in her
groin remained tight.
</P>
<P>
   So I made a tiny incision, and cut the tendon with a small
scalpel. That, I hoped, would free up movement in the joint. I
flexed and rotated her thigh until the ball appeared well seated in
the socket. I held Gabrielle's legs in position while the
technician applied the fiberglass cast that would stabilize her
hip.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrielle recovered easily from the anesthetic _ as children
usually do _ and was discharged. At her one-week post-op visit, her
X-rays looked fine. Five weeks later, a new set of X-rays showed
that the hip was still in good position, so we cut the cast down to
midthigh length.
</P>
<P>
   When the family came back for final cast removal, everyone's
spirits were high. Gaby held her mother's hand tightly as the loud,
buzzing cast saw cut away. She didn't cry or complain as the brace
was fitted. Then she headed home with her parents to celebrate _
and to take a bath.
</P>
<P>
   But when I saw the next X-ray three weeks later, my heart sank.
With the little extra motion allowed by the brace, and the stresses
of walking on the hip again, the ball had slipped right back to
where it had been before. I would have to go back to the operating
room.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrielle's parents read my face before I even started to speak.
``This is a setback,'' I said, ``not a disaster. We haven't lost
anything except a little time.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, I cut into the outer front of Gabrielle's left
hip. I separated layers of muscle and tendon down to the bag of
ligament and fibrous tissue that holds the joint together. I cut
away the thickened tissue and tightened the baggy upper part. When
I gently rotated Gaby's thigh inward, the ball fell into the socket
with no resistance. Then I held the hip where I wanted it while my
assistant put on the cast.
</P>
<P>
   Gaby was in her long cast for eight full weeks before she was
allowed to walk in a brace. She was as stiff as a board when I
finally let her spend a little time out of the brace, shortly after
her 4th birthday. Her X-rays continued to show a hip sitting
normally in the socket.
</P>
<P>
   Just before she started school, I examined Gaby again.
Everything looked great. ``Your daughter's not out of the woods
yet,'' I told her mother. ``She won't really be until her growth is
complete. I want to see her for new X-rays in three months, and
after that maybe we can go to every six months or a year between
visits.''
</P>
<P>
   I paused and took a deep breath. ``But I think she can stop
using the brace altogether now.''
</P>
<P>
   She smiled. I smiled. Gaby smiled, too, head down. ``Thank you,
Dr. Sussman,'' she said in a clear voice. I bent down and got a big
hug.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   As the plane banked toward a dirt airstrip, I looked out on New
Guinea's tropical rain forest, biologically one of the richest
environments on Earth. Suddenly, this embodiment of beauty was
shattered by a column of burning gas flaring up from an oil field.
The heat withered nearby trees, a perfect metaphor for human
desecration of nature.
</P>
<P>
   Then something large moved near the oil field, and I was
astonished to see it was a cassowary. These big, shy, ostrichlike
flightless birds that depend on undamaged forest are rarely found
anywhere near the disturbances people create. How could such an
elusive bird survive 10 feet from that searing flare?
</P>
<P>
   I have been studying birds and exploring the biology of New
Guinea for 35 years. My most recent project took place along the
Kikori River within the nation of Papua New Guinea, which occupies
the eastern half of the island. A decade ago, the discovery of oil
threatened the remote paradise.
</P>
<P>
   A consortium of oil companies, called Joint Venture Partners,
runs New Guinea's largest operating oil and natural gas field along
the Kikori. It is managed by a subsidiary of Chevron. From wells
100 miles inland and as high up as 4,400 feet, a pipeline carries
oil to the Gulf of Papua, where it is pumped into tankers.
</P>
<P>
   Oil is not the only danger to this pristine rain forest. Much of
it is slated to be cut down for timber.
</P>
<P>
   I was wary before I left for this trip, but from the moment I
landed at the airstrip in Moro, the partnership's headquarters at
the inland end of the pipeline, we were in for constant surprises.
Private security guards working for the company began rummaging
through our luggage, checking for items forbidden in the
partnership's lease area _ drugs, alcohol, material deemed
pornographic and firearms and other weapons.
</P>
<P>
   After the search, we were welcomed to offices of Moro's World
Wildlife Fund _ a partner with Chevron to preserve the Kikori area.
Here we found comforts we were not used to in the outback:
air-conditioned rooms, e-mail and phone links, dinner in a
luxuriously stocked cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   Before sunrise the next morning, I grabbed my binoculars for a
little bird-watching. I didn't expect much, but within hearing and
sight of the camp _ and its gas flare _ I watched some of New
Guinea's shiest and most heavily hunted bird species, including
harpy eagles, vulturine parrots and birds of paradise. What were
these retiring denizens of the rain forest doing near manmade
structures?
</P>
<P>
   For the next month, I birded every day through the rain forest
that led all the way down to the sea along the pipeline. Hundreds
of feet above the road and the nearby Kikori flowed another river _
of birds in the sky. Near the oil camps and gas flares ventured not
only cassowaries and harpy eagles but every single one of the other
large, threatened bird species of the New Guinea lowlands.
</P>
<P>
   The fauna throughout the oil lease zone remains pristine because
the partnership keeps a tight rein on employees' activities.
Prohibitions on hunting, exporting animals and plants, collecting
any living thing, making gardens and cutting down trees minimizes
forest disturbance. The partnership also rigorously controls the
number of people who can come here, requiring company authorization
to arrive by plane.
</P>
<P>
   Why was the partnership so strict _ how were these rules
connected to making money? A bird-watching Chevron executive
offered one answer: ``Bhopal, Exxon Valdez and the North Sea oil
rig'' _ notorious industrial disasters that cost Union Carbide,
Exxon and Shell Oil billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership has cause to worry about its activities in New
Guinea. Chevron learned its lesson the hard way when it cleared a
small summit on Mount Sisa for a helipad, intending to erect a
radio relay station there. As soon as Huli tribesmen living around
the base of the mountain saw helicopters hovering there, they began
climbing. On reaching the helipad, they introduced themselves and
announced their claim, demanding huge compensation for trespassing,
cutting trees and disturbing birds. Local Samberigi tribesmen later
hijacked chartered helicopters to enforce their demands. Faced with
lawsuits and bills for damages, Chevron abandoned the place.
</P>
<P>
   Similar considerations reinforced the partnership's desire to
keep environmental disturbances to a minimum. Local landowners also
get royalties on the oil pumped. The fees are a major source of
income for clans in the area. The partnership builds schools,
hospitals, roads and other public works at no cost.
</P>
<P>
   What I have witnessed along the Kikori has changed my mind about
the inevitability of environmental disaster when oil is pumped out
of the ground. But I worry about the other rivers I saw there,
rivers in the sky streaming constantly above me _ of birds, bats,
insects, spiders, seeds and pollen blown in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   As a bird-watcher, I was especially struck by the importance of
three components of the rivers. Most conspicuous were birds leaving
their roots daily to forage, or moving their roosts to track
seasonally shifting food supplies. Second were birds that hatch as
nestlings at one altitude, fly as juveniles to spend their early
years at some other altitude, then return as adults to build their
own nests and breed.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining bird movements were of individuals that disperse
only once in a lifetime, leaving their nest sites in search of new
breeding grounds. These movements are essential for maintaining
populations in habitats so small that they can support only one or
a few breeding pairs. For instance, I found a population of a high
altitude species otherwise missing in the conservation area _ the
superb bird of paradise. The population was just one adult male and
one female.
</P>
<P>
   All these movements of birds mean that a policy of landscape
management preserving only isolated pieces of natural habitat is
doomed to fail. The plant and animal populations in isolated
patches risk gradually going extinct unless a sea of natural
habitat surrounds and supports them. Instead, whole landscapes must
be preserved and managed.
</P>
<P>
   We have a model that may work: The oil partnership lease area
along the Kikori. It is the largest area of land rigidly controlled
and managed as an integrated entity in the country. Although the
reasons have to do with oil, not conservation, the requirements for
managing long subterranean oil pipelines have turned out to
coincide with the requirements for managing long aerial pipelines
of life.
</P>
<P>
   -----
 &UR; SIDEBAR: TIME TO STOP CUTTING DOWN TREES AS FAST AS THEY GROW &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What's left of the world's forest is being logged at such a
breakneck pace that almost all the remaining tropical rain forests
in the world will be destroyed within 50 years. In some countries,
such as the Philippines and the Solomon Islands, they'll be gone
within a decade. Most logging operations are nonsustainable _ trees
are cut faster than they can regrow.
</P>
<P>
   What can be done to halt the juggernaut? One solution is a
benign cutting schedule, called eco-forestry, that attempts to
harvest trees no faster than new ones can grow to replace them.
</P>
<P>
   Because an increasing fraction of the buying public _ especially
in North America and Europe _ would prefer to buy responsibly
harvested timber products, logging companies increasingly label
their operations as sustainable.
</P>
<P>
   To certify such claims, a coalition of environmental groups,
indigenous peoples' groups and other interests have set up the
Forest Stewardship Council. Logging projects have now been
certified in 20 countries, and public response is so favorable that
the demand for certified timber products exceeds the supply.

   Little Gabrielle, 3 years old, sat mutely on the examining
table. Her legs dangled over the edge, revealing a right knee that
protruded about an inch farther than the left.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can fix her, can't you, Doctor?'' her mother asked
anxiously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her pediatrician was very concerned,'' I said, evading the
question. In fact, her pediatrician had brought the X-rays straight
to my office door. Orthopedic surgery is rooted in a long tradition
of preventing deformity in children. (Orthopedics comes from two
Greek words meaning ``straight'' and ``child.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``When did you first notice something was wrong?'' I asked the
mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister noticed while watching a videotape we made at a
birthday party. Gaby was wearing shorts, and in one shot from the
back, I could see that her bottom was kind of tilted and that she
limped a little.''
</P>
<P>
   The X-ray suggested that the problem had developed gradually.
Gabrielle's right hip joint was perfectly normal, but the left hip
socket was enlarged and slightly shallow. Worse, the round head of
the femur wasn't centered in the socket but had slipped up toward
the outer edge.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrielle had a problem called developmental dysplasia, a
general term for a group of malformations in the hip joints of
children. Nobody knows what causes them. But early detection makes
dysplasia easier to treat.
</P>
<P>
   In this country, evaluation of the hips is an important part of
examining newborns. I had no way of knowing what Gabrielle's
examination had been like when she was a newborn. Most likely, she
had been born with slightly loose ligaments in her hips. As she
began to walk, and especially after she grew taller and heavier,
the increasing pressure on her hip joint would have caused the ball
of the femur to start slipping out of place. Eventually the ball
could work its way completely out of the socket. The hip would most
likely deteriorate, causing Gabrielle painful arthritis by the time
she was in her 30s.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrielle was easy to examine, but when she let me measure her
legs and move them through a range of motion, I noticed a slight
tightness in her left inner thigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not exactly an emergency,'' I told her mother, ``but I
want to bring Gabrielle into the hospital and get that hip back
where it belongs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Will she need surgery?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' I said. ``And there'll be some time in a cast too.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, Gabrielle was back in my examining room with
her family. I put up the X-ray, which easily showed the difference
between her two hip joints. The hard part was explaining the
treatment: A simple manipulation could possibly relocate the ball
in the socket, or I might have to perform an invasive operation to
clear away any tissue obstructing the socket. Either way, Gabrielle
would have to spend time in a cast stretching from her waist to her
ankle. Then she would have to wear a brace for at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of all this, the hip could migrate back out of the
socket, even years after surgery. That would mean another
operation, possibly cutting bone.
</P>
<P>
   After a moment, the father asked, ``Would all this have been
necessary if we had noticed it sooner?'' I told him we couldn't
know for certain.
</P>
<P>
   Gaby was admitted to the hospital a week later, and the cast
technician and I set up traction to draw her legs gently down and
apart, gradually stretching the soft tissue. In the operating room,
I could see that traction had helped. But with Gabrielle
anesthetized to allow her muscles to relax fully, the tendon in her
groin remained tight.
</P>
<P>
   So I made a tiny incision, and cut the tendon with a small
scalpel. That, I hoped, would free up movement in the joint. I
flexed and rotated her thigh until the ball appeared well seated in
the socket. I held Gabrielle's legs in position while the
technician applied the fiberglass cast that would stabilize her
hip.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrielle recovered easily from the anesthetic _ as children
usually do _ and was discharged. At her one-week post-op visit, her
X-rays looked fine. Five weeks later, a new set of X-rays showed
that the hip was still in good position, so we cut the cast down to
midthigh length.
</P>
<P>
   When the family came back for final cast removal, everyone's
spirits were high. Gaby held her mother's hand tightly as the loud,
buzzing cast saw cut away. She didn't cry or complain as the brace
was fitted. Then she headed home with her parents to celebrate _
and to take a bath.
</P>
<P>
   But when I saw the next X-ray three weeks later, my heart sank.
With the little extra motion allowed by the brace, and the stresses
of walking on the hip again, the ball had slipped right back to
where it had been before. I would have to go back to the operating
room.
</P>
<P>
   Gabrielle's parents read my face before I even started to speak.
``This is a setback,'' I said, ``not a disaster. We haven't lost
anything except a little time.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, I cut into the outer front of Gabrielle's left
hip. I separated layers of muscle and tendon down to the bag of
ligament and fibrous tissue that holds the joint together. I cut
away the thickened tissue and tightened the baggy upper part. When
I gently rotated Gaby's thigh inward, the ball fell into the socket
with no resistance. Then I held the hip where I wanted it while my
assistant put on the cast.
</P>
<P>
   Gaby was in her long cast for eight full weeks before she was
allowed to walk in a brace. She was as stiff as a board when I
finally let her spend a little time out of the brace, shortly after
her 4th birthday. Her X-rays continued to show a hip sitting
normally in the socket.
</P>
<P>
   Just before she started school, I examined Gaby again.
Everything looked great. ``Your daughter's not out of the woods
yet,'' I told her mother. ``She won't really be until her growth is
complete. I want to see her for new X-rays in three months, and
after that maybe we can go to every six months or a year between
visits.''
</P>
<P>
   I paused and took a deep breath. ``But I think she can stop
using the brace altogether now.''
</P>
<P>
   She smiled. I smiled. Gaby smiled, too, head down. ``Thank you,
Dr. Sussman,'' she said in a clear voice. I bent down and got a big
hug.

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: Caveat emptor: just stop looking
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I get all creepy-crawly even writing this. We are indebted to
New York Times arts reporter Carol Vogel for informing us of a
British exhibit headed our way in the fall. The show is called
``Sensation,'' and that is fair warning. Art is meant, sometimes,
to inflame and outrage. This exhibit bears a particularly onerous
load.
</P>
<P>
   Vogel says the show will include a dead shark afloat in
formaldehyde, a man's head cast in frozen blood and a depiction of
an artist's dead, naked father. The Times article itself is
accompanied by a photo of a pig, split longitudinally, titled
``This Little Piggy Went to Market.'' The show, expected to attract
the young and the senseless, should get all the censorious
attention it screams for. We're suckers for provocation.
</P>
<P>
   What to do? Easy. Don't censor. Don't go. Don't look. Let the
marketplace speak, not the censors.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, the American Nazi leader George Lincoln Rockwell made
a speaking appearance at Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio.
As soon as Rockwell began his customary rant, the audience silently
walked out. Rockwell was left sputtering angrily at the mike. He
had not been censored. Worse, he had been ignored.

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ As homeless men doze in the cheerless park
across from a Greyhound bus station, a small band of women bustle
with brooms and bleach.
</P>
<P>
   They sweep and disinfect the drab downtown spot, then add a jolt
of color _ a spray of banners, a parade of flags. Two hours later,
amid bleach fumes, freeway din and meandering pigeons, the women
preside at a joyful religious ceremony. They call it a Roman
Catholic Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Others call it heretical.
</P>
<P>
   For these women, in bold defiance of Catholic doctrine and
tradition, are casting open closet doors. For the first time in the
country, on a regular, public basis, they are holding prayer
services that until now have been conducted in secret, within
hundreds of homes but by invitation only, a sort of liturgical
underground.
</P>
<P>
   Now in the Oakland park, in a service both spiritual and
political, this cadre of women is denouncing the church's
opposition to women's ordination and acting as their own priests,
presiding in a role reserved for men.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our church,'' says Victoria Rue, 52, one of the
organizers of Critical Mass: Women Celebrating Eucharist. ``We are
not going to walk away and say OK, you guys take it. It is time, it
is past time, for women to be ordained, for theology to reflect
women's point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Risking excommunication, the women want to transform the very
foundation of the Roman Catholic Church, to loosen what they
consider a patriarchal throttlehold.
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of the church, however, the services do not
constitute a legitimate Mass. Nor are religious leaders likely to
sanction the women's dogged claims to the priesthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``... The Church is bound to follow the example of the Lord, who
chose only men as his apostles,'' the American Catholic Church said
last year in a document on the subject. ``The Sacrament of Holy
Orders . . . has always been reserved to men . . . the Church
considers this constant and universal tradition to be in accordance
with God's plan and to constitute a permanent norm.''
</P>
<P>
   Women have performed increasingly important roles in the
Catholic Church in recent years, becoming lecturers, distributing
communion and even running parishes due to a rising shortage of
clergymen. According to published statistics, the number of priests
nationally declined 19 percent between 1980 and 1998 when the
Catholic population grew 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 closeted groups of women around the country
routinely hold liturgies in their homes _ 10 times more than in
1992, says Sheila Dierks, author of ``WomenEucharist,'' a 1997
study of the underground movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are Catholic women who are still parish members, many
work for the church, and they are struggling with being a Catholic
woman in the '90s,'' says Dierks who is based in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   While surveys show support for women's ordination among
Catholics _ 65 percent favored it, according to one 1997 study _
while other mainline denominations have opened the priesthood to
women, the Vatican steadfastly adheres to centuries-old dogma in
barring women priests.
</P>
<P>
   The church has no authority to ordain women, Pope John Paul II
wrote in 1994. In his apostolic letter, he said that faithful
Catholics are expected to ``definitively'' hold to this teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last 20 years, the ordinary people have moved to the
left while the Vatican and the bishops and clergy have moved to the
right,'' says Don Wedd, a coordinator of Chicago-based Call to
Action, a national group of 19,000 lay and clergy members that
lobbies for such changes as women's ordination and optional
priestly celibacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is increasing polarization,'' he says. ``The church is
putting the cloak of infallibility on the subject of women's
ordination and saying it cannot be done, whereas (some) biblical
scholars and theologians say there is no biblical foundation
(against) it.''
</P>
<P>
   To the women of Critical Mass _ it has about 20 core members,
draws dozens more to its monthly services _ the priesthood ban is a
galling outrage, a symbol of inherent inequality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Roman Catholic, it's in my DNA,'' says San Francisco
psychotherapist Carolyn Kellogg, 62, a mother of five whose husband
of 42 years, Ralph, sets up sound equipment for the group's
unsanctioned services. ``With all its faults, this is the one for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Oakland's bishop publicly responded to Critical
Mass, saying the group reflects ``the pain, the grief and the
frustration of women who are angry with their church.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that as a man I can feel their pain, I am
sympathetic with it,'' wrote Bishop John S. Cummins, in the
diocese's newspaper the Catholic Voice.
</P>
<P>
   But Cummins said that such a group breeds disunity within the
church, ``at war with itself and the weapon is the Eucharist. It is
wrong to use the Eucharist in this way. . . . Wrongs are not
righted by bludgeoning each other with sacred things.''

   Parents can help make schools safer for their children by being
serious about controlling access to any guns in the household. It
is also important to discuss and practice non-violent methods of
resolving disputes so that children will have a model for doing so
when inevitable disagreements arise in their classrooms and during
activities.

AS ATROCITY REPORTS RISE, SO DOES THE FRUSTRATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ The pattern of atrocities against ethnic
Albanians is emerging like a photograph slowly developing, one
horrifying image after another.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence mounts, but the question remains: Will those
responsible ever be held accountable? Will Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic be prosecuted by the international war crimes
tribunal?
</P>
<P>
   Desperately trying to document a case for the prosecution amid
the chaos of a refugee crisis, Sheri Fink of the Boston-based
Physicians for Human Rights scribbled notes Saturday of the
testimony of refugees who had just arrived across the border.
</P>
<P>
   A 70-year-old woman from Pristina told of Serb paramilitaries in
black ski masks ordering her from her home at gunpoint, while a
next-door neighbor who resisted was stabbed to death on her front
step.
</P>
<P>
   Shaken and distraught members of a village near the border had
come to her with rumors _ not independently verified _ that Serb
troops had lined up 20 young men and forced them into a ditch, then
tossed in a grenade to kill them all.
</P>
<P>
   Fink's group is part of a network of international human rights
organizations and investigators from the United Nations and the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, all intent on
putting together the documentation they will need to bring those
responsible to justice.
</P>
<P>
   The work is painstaking and time-consuming. The stories must be
corroborated, and must be thoroughly spelled out in long
interrogations of witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But human rights workers here say they have been too busy
pitching in to meet the emergency needs of more than 600,000
refugees who have fled Kosovo into bordering Macedonia, Albania,
and Montenegro, in the worst humanitarian crisis in Europe since
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to roll up our sleeves and work on the urgent
needs of these people,'' Fink, 30, a physician, said as she tried
to find a few hours to continue questioning of victims before she
returned to a medical tent at the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all want to see these atrocities exposed and the people who
committed them brought to justice,'' she said. ``Of course it is
frustrating that we can't focus on that right now. It is worrisome
because at some point, if you wait too long, you can lose the
truth. Memory is a strange thing. Stories can slip away. Important
details vanish.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth is becoming a perishable commodity as the days of this
crisis turn into weeks. As the victims are bused here and there,
and as rumors whip through the camps, the true history of this
horror may be vanishing, and with it the chance at ensuring that
perpetrators are prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   The findings of preliminary field reports, just compiled by the
OSCE, were made available to The Boston Globe. They are not
extensive, but they do form an image of a campaign of terror.
</P>
<P>
   There are scores of accounts of people ordered from their homes
at gunpoint, of looting, of sporadic summary executions for those
who refused to leave. There are allegations of systematic rape and
pillage, which have been reported by the Pentagon. But all of these
accounts must be verified.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, the world's rights detectives are struggling to
piece together a case involving a crime scene that stretches across
the rocky terrain of Kosovo, where they are not allowed access, and
a list of hundreds of thousands of potential witnesses who are too
busy fleeing for their lives to stop and fill out questionnaires on
what happened to them.
</P>
<P>
   The international community is in many ways far more prepared
for this crisis in the Balkans than for the Bosnia conflict that
began in 1991. It wasn't until two years later that a war crimes
court, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former
Yugoslavia, was formed, based in the Dutch capital, The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal has indicted more than 80 people so far _ six of
whom have been convicted, one acquitted. Charges were dropped
against 18 others.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most notorious Yugoslav war criminals remain
fugitives, and critics say the international peacekeepers have not
done enough to capture them.
</P>
<P>
   The budget of the tribunal has grown to $94 million and its
staff to 625. The tribunal also may benefit from extensive NATO
satellite imagery to help document the case.
</P>
<P>
   But amid the overwhelming refugee crisis, some rights workers
say they fear that as horrible as Milosevic and his forces' acts of
``ethnic cleansing'' are, the opportunity to prosecute those
responsible will slip away if they don't turn their attention to
the task immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Some tribunal critics point out that The Hague has no
investigators yet in Macedonia and only a handful in Albania, where
the bulk of the Kosovar refugees fled.
</P>
<P>
   Early Saturday, in a hotel in Skopje, 12 members of human rights
monitoring groups met to try to coordinate a strategy. Agencies
divided up responsibilities to document the human rights
violations.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International,
Doctors without Borders, the OSCE, Physicians for Human Rights, and
other groups met with the United Nations High Commission for Human
Rights, which is taking the lead role in coordinating their
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Bernd Borschardt, deputy head of mission for the OSCE, said:
``We are right in the middle of a humanitarian crisis. So for the
people going through that, they have not been ready to talk to us
yet. They are too focused on their own very desperate situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Borschardt was the coordinator for the OSCE inside Kosovo, where
a staff was monitoring human rights violations until the
organization ordered its staff workers out three weeks ago as the
negotiations between Milosevic and NATO collapsed and conflict
seemed inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   He described the frustration of not being in Kosovo to document
and expose the atrocities being reported. There was a sense of fury
among rights workers that Milosevic should have escaped outside
scrutiny while carrying out a campaign of terror. But, he said, the
monitors, as much as they wanted to stay, had to leave or face
almost certain death.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I looked out my office window and saw tanks rolling by
piled up with looted goods from homes next door, I knew it was time
to go. That was about saving lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, he was working frantically, answering one phone call
after another, and trying to organize his staff. He showed
frustration with the difficulties of coordinating with
investigators in Albania, where, he said, ``reliable but
unconfirmed'' reports of widespread rape and atrocities were
surfacing.
</P>
<P>
   The organization does not have investigators in Montenegro
because of the dangers present for them in the smaller of the two
republics of Yugoslavia. He said the organization was bringing in
92 more people to assist in the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Jiri Dienstbier, the former Czech foreign minister and special
UN envoy for human rights, had just arrived and was rushing from
the hotel to the field to assess the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to collect as much information as possible to
determine Milosevic's strategy, to determine exactly how and why he
systematically cleared the areas he did. But these investigations
will be long and deep. It will have to take time,'' Dienstbier
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to move fast to document these cases,'' he added. ``It
is true that time is very important. But we also have to move in a
way that is thorough and methodical and detailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The rights workers also have been slowed because the victims are
simply in too much distress. They are waiting in six-hour lines for
daily food packets, and many were desperately trying to reunite
families splintered by the chaos of the border crossings and the
camps they have been forced into in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   At a wall plastered with hand-written notes of family members
trying to connect with separated loved ones, Faik Dragusha, 60,
peered through bifocals with one cracked lens, searching for any
news of his son.
</P>
<P>
   Dragusha, an oil truck driver, said that he and his family had
been waiting in a line of refugees several miles long at the border
three days ago when Serb paramilitary troops approached their car.
One of the soldiers smashed the car window with the butt of his
rifle and ordered Dragusha's 24-year-old son out of the vehicle and
took him away.
</P>
<P>
   Dragusha fears he may never see his son again. But consumed with
trying to get news of his son, he has not taken the time to
communicate the incident to human rights workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to find him. That is the only thing I can do right
now,'' he said as he wandered back into the rows of tents.
</P>
<P>
   As a cold drizzle began to fall at dusk Saturday, notes on a
wall, written in felt tip markers began to run.
</P>
<P>
   In a far corner of the sprawling Brazde refugee camp, a member
of the OSCE human rights monitoring team, Ed Knowles of California,
was sitting behind a folding table under a tent. One woman,
Lulieta, 23, approached the tent hesitantly with a story of how her
family had been ordered out of their home at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   She wanted to be sure that Knowles documented it. But over two
hours, she was the only one who came, and eventually Knowles was
called on to go and help out with the OSCE's processing of
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Knowles had been inside Kosovo until three weeks ago. He said
that he had been documenting atrocities and seeing a pattern
forming in the weeks leading up to the NATO strikes. But after they
began, the atrocities took on a ferocious intensity, Knowles said.
</P>
<P>
   The paramilitary forces, a dozen different bands with names like
Arkan's Tigers, White Eagles, and the Frenkis, attach themselves to
what is known as ``the MUPs,'' a Serb nickname for the special
police under the Serbian Ministry of the Interior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a witchhunt,'' Knowles said, explaining that civilians in
the towns and villages lead the paramilitaries to homes of ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going on right now inside there,'' Knowles, said,
gesturing to the rocky hillsides in the distance where the border
lies, 5 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday afternoon, Fink drove out to the border to see if
any refugees were getting through. She was stopped by Macedonian
police, who refused to let her pass into the no man's land where
there were unconfirmed reports that refugees were not being
permitted through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is important and very much of the essence, but these
atrocities will not go away,'' Fink said. ``We just have to work
much harder to make them come to light. I have to believe that. I
have to believe that Milosevic and those repsonsible won't get away
with it.''

WINDOWS ON A WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
 
(Editor's note: As NATO's assault on Yugoslavia began last month,
Globe reporter Patti Hartigan e-mailed a contact in Belgrade to ask
for an on-line account of what was happening. She has received
scores of responses.)
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the face of the crackdown on independent media in Yugoslavia,
the Internet has become a prime source of information in Belgrade
and beyond. It is functioning as a virtual town square in the
war-torn Balkans; residents surf the Web for credible information,
post messages on bulletin boards, and send e-mail all over the
world. Complete strangers _ from Kansas to Kosovo _ are discussing
the conflict on line. The global village has never been more vital.
</P>
<P>
   A single query produces a deluge of responses, from private
diaries of Belgrade mothers worried about their children, to
missives from activists agonizing over the fate of the ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, to Americans searching for ways to help the
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   This communication is both immediate and intimate, yet detached
and distanced. There is always a surreal quality, an eerie feeling,
that comes with virtual communication, but it is vastly more
pronounced during a time of military conflict. There is a curious
mix of empowerment and impotence: to be so close, yet so very far
away.
</P>
<P>
   What follows are various voices from the war zone. Some were
relayed to the Globe via the Internet and others were obtained from
various Web sites monitoring the situation. Each has been verified.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``Every evening, at dusk, my hands start to tremble without
control. It goes on for a few hours. I heard that some other women
have the same symptoms of fear of air raids after dusk. Men behave
differently; they raise their voices and have more opinions than
usual on matters of life and death. We are afraid of their death
more than of our death. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``My father dreamed all last night that he was saving me from
the bombs. He was sleepwalking as he used to do when he was young,
taking me as a baby in his arms and rushing to the door. It went on
for years, his war trauma, until it stopped with this new war. He
passed it on to me. I started dreaming his dream. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends and enemies from all over the world ask me, `Do you
realize how terrible it is in Kosovo?' I do, I really do, and I
feel guilty that we feel bad here without having the horror they
do. But our war, for the past 10-50 years, has always been this
kind of invisible horror. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel we are being cut away from the rest of the world, more
bridges down, more friends and enemies pointing out to us here how
bad we are, more crazy people here making careers on screaming how
we are heavenly people. And the people? In cellars or just in beds
waiting for nothing. I dreamed last night of bombs falling in my
cellar, in my bed, and afterwards feeling relieved and free. I
should stop writing. I hate my dreams, thoughts, and words.''

e-mail.

   ``The streets are different. We used to have heavy firing at
night but not so much during the day. Now there is shooting all of
the time, day and night. It's not fighting, just shooting in all
directions. Everyone is shooting outside. It is going on now. . . .
Only women dare go out. The men are too vulnerable. But there were
no shops open and nothing to buy. Already we started using the food
that we had set aside as reserves. . . . We have four families
living in a three-bedroom flat, fifteen people. So we have more
mouths to feed. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not afraid that someone will come and kill me if it will
be a quick death. Nowadays, only living started scaring me to
death. . . .''

   ``I'd like you to know that we haven't been ignorant, nor
indifferent about what has been going on in (Kosovo). Most of us
have relatives and friends living there, and the news always found
a way to leak through. . . . Why didn't we do anything about it?
That is a question which mystifies me, too. Maybe that's the sin we
are paying the price for now.
</P>

<P>
   !!! Cookie's Fortune Robert Altman, in a light, warm,
audience-pleasing mood, fills the screen with Southern eccentrics
in an archetypal Mississippi Delta town. The film is anchored by
the low-key decency of Charles S. Dutton as a man wrongfully
accused of murder, and by Glenn Close's wicked witch of the South,
busily staging a production of ``Salome'' and behaving as if she
wants everyone's head on a platter, not just John the Baptist's.
(PG13) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   !!! Dream Life of Angels French filmmaker Erick Zonka makes an
assured and increasingly moving debut in this naturalistic and
always spontaneous tale of two young women in the city of Lille,
drifting between nowhere jobs and nowhere boyfriends. If Hollywood
had made this film, it would have seemed cute or rigged; Zonka
fills it with existential tang. (R) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   !!! Go Doug Limon's follow-up to ``Swingers'' is slick and edgy
and barely conceals the obviousness of its manipulations, but it
lives up to its title, as it propels a screenful of Angelenos
through a wild couple of nights. Sarah Polley is the standout here,
as a woman fleeing the consequences of an amateur drug deal gone
nighmarishly wrong. (R) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   !!! Never Been Kissed Drew Barrymore's winning streak continues
in the romantic comedy that casts her as an undercover reporter who
goes back to high school and gets the chance to relive her painful
adolescence, this time without the humiliations and the zits. The
sweetness of her smile tilts the film toward the romance in this
romantic comedy, never a liability in a date movie. (PG13)

THE QUIET MAN WHO BROKERED NORTHERN IRELAND'S PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
MAKING PEACE 
By George J. Mitchell. Knopf. 
192 pp. $24. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's very little that Protestant unionists and Catholic
nationalists in Northern Ireland agree on. But one of those things
is that had it not been for George Mitchell the Good Friday
Agreement that crafted a political settlement in Northern Ireland
last year would not have been reached. The recent breakdown in
talks between the parties, over the decommissioning of IRA arms,
has thrown the process into crisis, but that detracts nothing from
Mitchell's contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, the former US Senate majority leader from Maine,
brought to the task of chairing the negotiations in Belfast the
honest, straightforward approach that made him a popular figure on
Capitol Hill for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   In this account of his four years shuttling to and from Northern
Ireland, first as President Clinton's envoy, then as the mediator
who knocked heads together and got a deal done, Mitchell tells a
story that is very much a reflection of the author: understated,
sometimes even dull, but always honest and eminently fair. At its
best, the book conveys the tension, drama, and high-wire diplomacy
that almost doomed the peace process but ultimately was its
salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell is a diehard Red Sox fan, and his love of such a
star-crossed team no doubt prepared him well for Irish tragedy.
Sometimes this book descends into the kind of inside baseball that
will make tough reading for those who do not follow Anglo-Irish
relations closely. Yet Mitchell's account of the negotiating
process, especially the last few fraught days at the dark and dingy
Government Buildings complex at Stormont in East Belfast, is
compelling stuff and sets the benchmark against which any
subsequent books on that part of the peace process will be judged.
</P>
<P>
   One of the strengths of the book is that while Mitchell is
refreshingly honest in his descriptions of the various political
leaders in Northern Ireland, he is remarkably restrained and
nonjudgmental. He resists the temptation to call the Rev. Ian
Paisley, the fundamentalist preacher whose hard-line unionist party
tried to wreck the talks at every turn, a blustering bigot. But
Mitchell's impassive description of Paisley's hateful carping, and
especially the role Paisley and his party played in smearing Martha
Pope, Mitchell's longtime aide, allows readers to draw their own
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Globe played a small role in exposing that scandal.
The British and Irish tabloids that carried the smear that Pope was
having an affair with a convicted IRA bomber were forced to print
retractions and pay her six figures in monetary damages after a
British official gave an interview to the Globe denying the
existence of the intelligence reports that the newspapers cited as
the basis for their claims. Mitchell held his tongue during the
scandal, but he makes it clear that he resents both Paisley and
British intelligence agents who smeared Pope.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell's humanity shines through. When the IRA stormed the
children's ward at a Belfast hospital, shooting and wounding police
officers who were guarding one of Paisley's deputies, Nigel Dodds,
Mitchell was appalled. At the time of the attack, Dodds was
visiting his 7-year-old son, who suffers from spina bifida.
Mitchell called Dodds to comfort him, observing, ``He belongs to a
party that strongly opposed me, but this was beyond politics,
beyond reason, beyond humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell is an intensely private man. But the glimpses he
provides into the strain the peace process placed on his personal
life are revealing and humanize what could have been a dry account
of diplomatic derring-do. He writes poignantly of being torn
between his duty to his family and his duty in Belfast. He was
initially told by the White House that his commitment would be a
few months. It turned out to be four years, and Mitchell constantly
wrestled with being away from his wife and, later, their son.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Heather, miscarried their first child while he was
stuck in Belfast, listening to politicians drone on about
grievances real and imagined. His beloved older brother, Robbie,
died while the politicians dickered about on simple procedural
matters. He recounts movingly the final conversation he had with
his brother, and how he lay down in his hotel room and cried when
he hung up the phone.
</P>
<P>
   The last few days of the talks, when he literally sequestered
the negotiators and ordered them to reach an agreement or tell the
world why they failed, demonstrated how crucial Mitchell's past
experience as a judge and a consensus builder in Congress was to
clinching the deal.
</P>
<P>
   He says the deal would have collapsed if the Irish government
had not agreed over the last few days to water down language in the
agreement that Protestant unionists found objectionable. The Irish
premier, Bertie Ahern, and his British counterpart, Tony Blair,
emerge as determined, pragmatic leaders who locked themselves away
to get the deal done.
</P>
<P>
   For all his bipartisan success in the Senate, Mitchell says his
accomplishments in Northern Ireland gave him the most satisfaction
of anything he's done in public life. Despite ongoing difficulties
that were much in evidence in the last week, he predicts the
agreement will survive and that democracy will evolve in Northern
Ireland. He bases that belief on his interaction not with
politicians, but with ordinary people, who have willed that the
peace hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Good Friday Agreement will endure because it is fair and
balanced,'' Mitchell says, using words that could very well
describe this book.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell could have written a more sensational book, making all
sorts of inflammatory remarks about the colorful, sometimes
maddening people he had to put up with while he earned no salary
and suffered from perpetual jet lag. But that is not his style, and
that is very much why, after 30 years of killing each other, people
in Northern Ireland now have a chance to live more normal lives.
</P>
<P>
   As they say in Belfast, good on ye, George.

MORE CUTS ARE URGED IN MASSACHUSETTS FORESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Massachusetts has lost 85,000 acres of forest since 1985, most
apparently to new subdivisions, malls, and businesses, while trees
have continued to reclaim abandoned farms and pasture in Western
Massachusetts, according to a new federal survey.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, existing forests are growing older and
thicker, perhaps a little too much so, according to some forestry
specialists who contend that some judicious clear-cutting would
improve forest health and aid birds and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   The new inventory by the US Forest Service found that forests
covered 62.5 percent of Massachusetts last year. That was down from
64.2 percent when the last report was done in 1985, but up from an
apparent century low of 59 percent in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little surprised by the numbers, because I actually
thought the losses could have been worse,'' said Matthew J. Kelty,
a silviculture professor at the University of Massachusetts at
Amherst.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forest as a whole is aging and getting fuller with, for
the most part, larger, taller, denser trees,'' Kelty said.
</P>
<P>
   While aesthetically pleasing for homeowners and hikers, the
thicker and higher forest canopy may be less than ideal
ecologically, Kelty and others said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Rivers, a senior Department of Environmental Management
official who participated in the study, said the study suggests
that Massachusetts could be especially vulnerable if a hurricane
like the 1938 storm hit inland areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid if we were to have a hurricane like that now, the
damage would be a lot greater'' than it would be if the forest had
more saplings and medium tree, Rivers said.
</P>
<P>
   Measured by relative density, two-thirds of Massachusetts forest
tree volume is ``sawtimber'' trees, those big enough to yield 12-
and 8-foot-long pieces that can be milled into lumber.
</P>
<P>
   Another 28 percent is made up of poletimber, intermediate-sized
trees at least five inches in diameter. Only 6 percent is seedlings
and saplings.
</P>
<P>
   A healthier mix, some specialists said, would be closer to 20 to
30 percent small growing trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need more seedlings and saplings in there,'' said Carol
Alerich, the Forest Service official who compiled the report.
Stands of small, growing trees invite songbirds, moose, and deer,
while a better distribution of young trees can even out losses of
older trees to storms and rot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wildlife biologists are always telling the foresters to do
more clear-cutting, rather than less, because we're not doing any
now,'' said Kelty. Selective clearing of 3- to 10-acre parcels
might be a good policy in state and private forests and wildlife
preserves.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials conducted the survey by scrutinizing 18,000
aerial photographs of the state to measure forest cover, then
having 28 trained foresters observe tree composition in 798 6-acre
plots to estimate trends in 3.1 million acres of forest, Alerich
said.
</P>
<P>
   Across Massachusetts, Alerich said, five out of six trees being
removed are being lost to land clearing, rather than lumbering.
</P>
<P>
   The only species found to be under pressure for lumber use is
the red oak, which since 1985 has been selectively removed 10 to 20
percent faster than stocks have grown.
</P>
<P>
   While the state's environment could benefit from having more
oaks in early growing stages, removal rates are far from allowing
oaks to be crowded out by other species, Alerich said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, species such as hemlock and red maple are
growing several times faster than they are being removed. In the
case of hemlocks, this trend could provide a needed cushion if the
wooly adelgid, a lethal parasite that has begun invading the Bay
State, becomes a widespread threat.
</P>
<P>
   In Worcester County, forest cover has fallen by 9.4 percent
since 1985, or 66,000 acres, apparently because of exurban growth
and homebuilding. Every city and town in Worcester County gained
population during the 1980s, census figures show, a trend that
demographers estimate has continued since then.
</P>
<P>
   After recovering 200,000 acres from 1972 to 1985, Eastern
Massachusetts has since lost 4.5 percent of its forest, or 54,000
acres. Meanwhile, the western four counties' forest land grew by
2.7 percent, or 35,000 acres, continuing a decades-old trend of
forests there reclaiming former agricultural land.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys made in 1915, 1928, and 1953 indicated that
Massachusetts forests totalled about 3.27 million acres. That
figure dipped to 2.95 million in 1972 amid the post-World War II
boom of suburban development and highway construction, but 250,000
acres came back by 1985.

FAMILIES IN CRISIS LEARN TO COPE, STAY TOGETHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROUND ROCK, Texas _ The date is etched like a jagged scar on
Janelle's psyche: Jan. 10, 1998, the day she first hit her
5-week-old son. Not once, but twice. Hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Logan was an easy target, I took a lot of my aggressions
out on him. When I slapped him, I wanted to do it again. And I
did,'' she said. Her hard eyes softened, then dripped tears down
her cheeks and onto her Mickey Mouse T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   A 32-year-old single mother who works at a 7-Eleven store,
Janelle seemed destined to be separated forever from Logan _ by law
or by death. ``The way things were going, either way he wouldn't be
here,'' she said. ``He would have been taken away permanently or I
would have killed him. It sounds so awful, but it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, in most places, those are pretty much the only
options, and some child advocates maintain that permanent removal
doesn't happen often or fast enough to protect at-risk children.
</P>
<P>
   But here, in a bucolic setting flanked by strip malls, there is
another way.
</P>
<P>
   After Janelle's son was temporarily placed with her sister, a
therapist referred Janelle (who asked that her last name be
withheld) to the Texas Baptist Children's Home, a nonprofit
organization with a unique program founded on a deceptively simple
notion.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that sometimes it is best to keep families in crisis
together, not in their own homes but in structured settings, to
work through their problems with heavy doses of supervision,
financial assistance, faith, and compassion.
</P>
<P>
   Called the Single-Parent Family Care Program, the effort has
attracted widespread interest _ though few imitators _ as notorious
cases of child abuse and neglect, followed by calls for systemic
reform, seem to occur as regularly as the seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent example in Massachusetts occurred in January,
when five children, ages 22 months to 13 years, were found dirty
and shivering in the unheated basement of their Everett home.
Police said the house was strewn with trash, animal feces, and
soiled clothes. Neighbors and school officials had filed 13 neglect
complaints in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   There is no telling whether that mother and her children would
have fit in at the Texas Baptist Children's Home, but officials say
they have done wonders in cases that seem far worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can intervene quickly, with the mother and children
together, you can prevent a lot of the agony, a lot of the future
problems, a lot of the future needs,'' said Debbie Nagle, the
program's administrator. ``The key is to see the family as a
system, not as a group of individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1950, the Children's Home is on a 112-acre campus 20
miles north of Austin. The grounds resemble graduate student
housing, with a picturesque chapel and other buildings made of
yellow limestone separated by playgrounds, a tennis court, and wide
stretches of grassy space. The home's primary function is to
provide residential care and follow-up help for abused and
neglected children, hundreds of whom are served every year.
</P>
<P>
   The Single-Parent Family Care Program, celebrating its 20th
anniversary, is centered in three large homes, called cottages.
Each can house up to five families and a staff couple who supervise
day-to-day life, provide on-site counseling, and serve as a model
for parenting and life skills. On a recent visit, there were 12
mothers, ages 22 to 49, with 17 children ranging in age from 6
months to 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   Families remain an average of about four months _ some stay just
a few weeks to weather a financial crisis _ but Janelle has been
here for just over a year. Sitting in the living room of a cottage
called Family House, surrounded by homey touches like flowered
quilts and framed copies of the Lord's Prayer, Janelle seemed as
comfortable as the overstuffed furniture.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment she moved in, on March 11, 1998, Janelle and the
Children's Home staff worked on reuniting her with Logan, an
energetic boy with a genetic disorder that has misshapen his face
and skull.
</P>
<P>
   A Wisconsin native who said she survived a childhood of incest,
Janelle described an arduous process of daily counseling to deal
with her anger, followed by supervised visits with Logan, to
overnight stays with a baby monitor in her room, which allowed
cottage staff members to listen as she cared for her son. By last
August, they were together full time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to get well,'' she said. ``A year out of my life for
the life of my son was nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Now living in an efficiency apartment adjacent to one of the
other cottages, Janelle and Logan plan to move from the Children's
Home as soon as she finds an affordable apartment. Like all the
mothers here, she has developed money management skills, with the
staff's help, to stretch her limited income.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to move, to get out on my own and prove to myself
that I can do it,'' she said. ``But here I still have the safety
net. When I'm out for a month or three months, or however long, I
can always come back here for help.''
</P>
<P>
   As she tells her story, other women wander through, on their way
to work or school _ idleness is not an option _ or to pick up their
children from day care.
</P>
<P>
   One of the women is Adel Sawey, a 49-year-old single mother
whose 11-year-old son, Christopher, had been living in a
residential care cottage at the Children's Home. She moved into a
family cottage so they could be together under the watchful eye of
Dena Ransom, the ``house mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a few days, Christopher will be moving into Sawey's
small, spotless room with mauve carpet, decorated with photos and
colorfully painted wood works of art she creates. Sawey sought help
for Christopher, who suffers from attention deficit disorder and
depression, when she began losing control, taking out her
frustrations on him with her belt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I would hurt him. I knew I needed help. . . . I didn't
have the tools to take care of him,'' she said through tears. ``One
day I will take my son from here with a happy heart. This place
represents hope to me.''
</P>
<P>
   There is good reason for Sawey's optimism: The Single-Parent
Family Care Program claims a remarkable success rate. One survey
conducted in 1995 showed that 92 percent of residents from 1991-95
were still living in their own homes or subsidized housing, 60
percent were employed, and 28 percent were attending school full
time. Upon admission, 70 percent had been unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the program served 24 families, and only one was
deemed a failure. That case involved a mother who repeatedly used
drugs while in the cottage. ``There is a point where we can only go
so far,'' Nagle said.
</P>
<P>
   Up until that point, the program does a remarkable amount for
its residents, providing them with not just shelter but food,
clothing when needed, and all other household necessities. In
exchange, the women do chores in the cottages and are asked to pay
a $50 monthly program fee, more to give them a sense of
``ownership'' than to raise money, Nagle said.
</P>
<P>
   The program costs $215,000 a year _ or about $58 per family per
day _ a fraction of the $3.9 million Children's Home budget. The
home gets about a quarter of its money from the Texas Baptist
Cooperative Program, a church charity; a quarter from its
endowment; and the rest from gifts and other sources. It takes no
state or federal aid. ``That way we don't have to deal with a lot
of government restrictions,'' Nagle said.
</P>
<P>
   But with a capacity of just 15 families, the Children's Home
gets 30 referrals for every family it can accept, Nagle said. The
agency plans to double the capacity _ perhaps making room for
single-father families _ and to open a similar program in another
Texas city.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the expansion plans, no one here claims the program is a
cure-all. It works mainly for motivated parents who are willing to
do whatever it takes to keep their families intact. ``If a woman is
a chronic welfare mother, she doesn't fit,'' said Jerry Bradley,
the home's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   An important undercurrent of all activities at the Children's
Home is Christian faith, as ubiquitous as children on bicycles.
``We're unashamedly Christian, but we're in no way going to force
our thinking on any of these women,'' Nagle said.
</P>
<P>
   Former residents, many of whom stay in touch with cottage staff
members, are eager to attest to the program's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even now, if we need anything, the Children's Home will help
us,'' said Leslie Searle, who in the early 1990s spent more than a
year here with her two children, now 13 and 10. She will soon begin
law school at Texas Tech University.
</P>
<P>
   To hear Nagle tell it, all it takes is a little money, a lot of
patience, and a plan to teach women to help themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone feels like they're backed into a corner, everything
feels so bleak, give them hope, and it does so much,'' she said.
``We want them to be safe and comfortable, but not so comfortable
they don't want to leave.''

`WALDO RESERVOIR' THREATENS WILDLIFE REFUGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPENCEVILLE, Calif. _ Spenceville, Calif., died a century ago
when its copper mine played out, but its namesake wildlife refuge
lives on. Now, environmentalists fear the very heart of the refuge
may be cut out by their worst nightmare: a dam.
</P>
<P>
   While Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and other
environmentally-attuned officials continues to push dams to free
rivers, the Yuba County Water Agency wants to build a dam that
would flood much of the richest wildlife habitat in the Sierra
Nevada foothills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waldo Reservoir'' is only a name on the map of the Spenceville
Wildlife Preserve today. But the water agency sees it as a future
reservoir covering 3,500 acres, providing flood protection for Yuba
County, which has a history of catastrophic flooding.
</P>
<P>
   The agency insists that the Waldo dam is just one of many
possible features in a comprehensive flood control plan for the
Yuba River watershed, and that environmentalists are overreacting.
Nevertheless, Mother Lode grass-roots organizations have taken up
battle stations to squelch it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't mitigate for the damage it would cause,'' said Julie
Carville, a Nevada City biologist, author, wildflower expert and a
leader of Friends of Spenceville.
</P>
<P>
   The reservoir formed by a Waldo dam would fragment one of the
finest pieces of publicly held oak woodland in California, drowning
the area's rich flora and disrupting feeding, nesting, spawning and
migration patterns of wildlife, environmentalists say. Further,
they contend, the reservoir would cover the old copper mine,
allowing acid residue to seep into the water. When water levels
drop, they fear the residue would ring the reservoir, creating both
an eyesore and a health hazard.
</P>
<P>
   Managed by the state Department of Fish and Game, Spenceville
encompasses 11,213 acres of woodland and rolling hills of easy
hiking trails and splendid scenery.
</P>
<P>
   The preserve is also home to 175 species of birds, including
wild turkeys and several rare species, such as the reclusive black
rail.
</P>
<P>
   No one argues the need for better flood protection in Yuba
County, where the Yuba, Feather and Bear rivers converge. The
county has been ravaged by 10 major floods this century, most
recently in 1997 when 100,000 people were evacuated, 850 homes were
damaged or destroyed, and 16,000 acres flooded by a break in the
Feather River levee at Arboga, south of Marysville.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is whether it takes a dam to provide that protection.
In the first phase of its flood control study, the water agency's
board rejected alternatives, such as levee setbacks, enlarging
river channels or creating a bypass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We calculated that we couldn't pass on the flood risk
downstream,'' said Curt Aikens, the water agency's point man for
the flood control project.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed Waldo dam _ 220 feet tall and 4,000 feet wide _
would create an ``off-stream'' reservoir 6 miles from the Yuba
River, capable of holding 300,000 acre-feet of water.
</P>
<P>
   Because normal flow from Dry Creek, which runs through the
preserver, is insufficient to fill such a large reservoir, most of
the water stored by the dam would be transported in huge pipes from
Englebright Reservoir, upstream on the Yuba River.
</P>
<P>
   County officials say the new reservoir would allow them to keep
lower water levels in the main reservoirs on the Yuba and Feather
rivers, ensuring extra capacity when the rivers are at flood stage.
</P>
<P>
   But the South Yuba Citizens League, Friends of Spenceville and
two dozen other local organizations contend that the planned
reservoir is unnecessarily costly, as well as a blight on one of
the Sierra foothills' great beauty spots.
</P>
<P>
   The Waldo Reservoir would flood the abandoned Spenceville copper
mine, which contains more than 100,000 cubic yards of toxic
tailings. ``They'd have to truck all that soil away,'' biologist
Carville said.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Fish also has expressed concerns about the
dam. In its first look at the plan, the department responded with a
list of more than a dozen objections focusing on the damage to an
area of ``exceptional species richness.''

FAULKNER'S TOWN HONORS A TOWERING EUDORA WELTY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. _ Eudora Welty once said that sharing a literary
landscape with William Faulkner was like living near a mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Welty weaved a gentle tapestry of words in contrast to
Faulkner's sound and fury, yet in the four decades she has survived
him, she, too, has gained international recognition while winning
their home state's deep affection, which was denied to Faulkner in
his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   When Welty reaches her 90th birthday Tuesday, the celebration in
Mississippi will be as quiet and mannered as one of her novels.
Frail with age, she will more than likely spend the day in her
home, friends say, enjoying the visits of a few companions who drop
by to see her regularly, swapping yarns and laughter.
</P>
<P>
   In Faulkner's hometown, Welty is being honored, in absentia, at
the annual Oxford Conference for the Book this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Though she won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1972, and was
awarded the Medal of Freedom by President Jimmy Carter in 1980
before being inducted into France's Legion d'Honneur in 1996, ``she
is really just now being discovered,'' said Noel Polk, a Welty
scholar and English professor at the University of Southern
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was thought of as female, and somehow inferior to
Faulkner,'' Polk said in a telephone interview. ``But what goes
unsaid is that what lies near a mountain is usually another
mountain. Miss Welty has established herself as a new mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   Welty reigns as the belle of letters in a state that has
produced extraordinary talent. Today, Mississippi writers not only
mention Welty in the same breath with Faulkner, they talk of her
courage during the troubled 1960s, when segregation fell in
sunbursts of freedom marches, bombings, and murders.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's an absolutely wonderful writer,'' said Josephine Haxton,
a novelist who uses the pen name Ellen Douglas. ``But she's also a
steady political person who stood for decency and for the rights of
people in Mississippi and never sought the limelight for herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Haxton, who lives in Welty's neighborhood in Jackson, recalls
that Welty was once asked if she feared the Ku Klux Klan might
attack her home. ``You know,'' Welty replied, ``people who burn
crosses don't usually read The New Yorker.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in The New Yorker that one of Welty's strongest short
stories appeared in 1963, shortly after NAACP leader Medgar Evers
was killed by a sniper a few miles across town in Jackson. Entitled
``Where Is the Voice Coming From?'' it is a narrative told by a man
consumed by racial hatred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I says to my wife,'' the story begins. `` `You can reach and
turn it off. You don't have to set and look at a black nigger face
no longer than you want to, or listen to what you don't want to
hear. It's still a free country.' I reckon that's how I give myself
the idea.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``idea'' was to stalk an NAACP official and shoot him down
in the driveway of his home.
</P>
<P>
   The story was written before the murder was linked to Byron De
La Beckwith, a white supremacist from the Delta, yet the narrator
bears an uncanny resemblance to him.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, shortly after a Mississippi jury convicted Beckwith of
the murder more than 30 years after the killing, Welty was asked
how she had been able to capture Beckwith's personality. She
dismissed her prescience.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment she heard the news of Evers's death, she said,
``We all knew who did it. Because we all knew Beckwiths. It wasn't
necessary to know that man, Beckwith.''
</P>
<P>
   Welty never married. She has lived for nearly 75 years in the
comfortable house her parents built across a tree-lined street from
Belhaven College, a Presbyterian school a few blocks from the state
capitol.
</P>
<P>
   As a young woman, Welty worked for the Works Progress
Administration, one of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal
programs that brought relief to Mississippi. She traveled the
state, taking photographs as evocative of that desperate period as
Walker Evans's images in ``Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.''
</P>
<P>
   Welty's shadow haunts the foreground of one of her most
remarkable pictures, a lonely setting of columns at the ``Ruins of
Windsor,'' all that remained of a plantation mansion destroyed by
fire.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago she was asked if she had planned to use her
shadow to add mood to the photograph. ``Of course not,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her modesty is a characteristic that carries over into her work.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is much less an elitist than Faulkner,'' said Richard
Ford, a prize-winning novelist who grew up in Jackson. ``She's much
better educated than Faulkner. She benefited from coming along
after Faulkner. He established a camp farthest out, and it had a
good effect on her because her work was encouraged to be more
accessible.''
</P>
<P>
   Reading Faulkner is a deep and mysterious exercise, the
equivalent of a Catholic Mass said in Latin. Welty's books are
similarly enriching, but are written with the simple eloquence of a
Methodist service in the church she attended as a child.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his power as a writer, Faulkner was scorned as a
pretentious figure in Oxford. Townspeople never forgave him for
returning from World War I with British airs, false claims of
heroism, and an ensemble of tweedy clothes. They called him ``Count
No Count.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Faulkner was a resident alien,'' said Barry Hannah, a
masterful short story writer who lives in Oxford and teaches at the
University of Mississippi. ``The difference is that Miss Eudora was
a permanent fixture through thick and thin. During the civil rights
horrors, she gave us hope that a decent white artist could survive
in a state that reflected South Africa's values. It took a lot of
guts.''
</P>
<P>
   In an essay published in The Atlantic Monthly in 1965, three
years after Faulkner's death, Welty defended her colleague after a
literary critic declared that Faulkner should be reassessed because
he was, ``after all, only a white Mississippian.''
</P>
<P>
   The books Faulkner left behind could speak volumes in answer,
she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The color of his skin would modify it just about as much as
would the binding of his book. Integrity can be neither lost nor
concealed nor faked nor quenched nor artificially come by nor
outlived, nor, I believe, in the long run denied. Integrity is no
greater and no less today than it was Saturday and will be
tomorrow. It stands outside time.''
</P>
<P>
   Employing her own style, Welty is as lyrical as any of the great
American writers of the 20th century. Elegant passages run through
Welty's prose like golden threads.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Optimist's Daughter,'' her novel that won the Pulitzer
Prize, she portrayed a selfish, small-minded widow:
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps she was forty. There was little even of forty in her
looks except the line of her neck and the backs of her little
square, idle hands. She was boney and blue-veined, as a child she
had very possibly gone undernourished. Her hair was still a
childish tow. It had the tow texture, as if, well rubbed between
the fingers, those curls might have gone to powder. She had round,
country-blue eyes and a little feist jaw.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is better at taking the density of lived experience
that seems imperceptible and making it thrilling,'' Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 40 years younger than Welty, Ford has a boyhood memory of
his mother pointing out the famous lady while shopping at a Jitney
Jungle Supermarket in Jackson. He did not meet Welty until years
later, but became a steadfast friend.
</P>
<P>
   At a literary gathering shortly after he won the 1995 Pulitzer
Prize for his own novel, ``Independence Day,'' Ford paid homage to
Welty by choosing to read from her work rather than his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire her terrifically,'' he said the other day. ``And she
is a hero for a lot of women writers who were faced with a decision
to go at it alone.''

BUSH, MCCAIN CANDIDACIES DIVERGE OVER KOSOVO CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The addition of New Hampshire Senator Judd Gregg's name to
George W. Bush's crowded letterhead provides a revealing backdoor
view of the presidential candidate's real thinking about the
defining crisis in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   It also provides one more point of contrast with the person
whose strong leadership on the issue has won, hands down,
nationally as well as in pivotal New Hampshire, the first
competition of the fledgling campaign, the Kosovo Caucus.That, of
course, is Arizona Senator John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   First, the revelation about Governor Bush. Gregg's recruitment _
and its timing _ demonstrate the war's place in the Bush campaign _
somewhere between inconsequential and irrelevant. Consider: Here's
Bush Fils, the Dauphin, who after two embarrassing weeks of ducking
and dodging, backing and filling, hedging and hinting, finally
avers that maybe there's an American responsibility in all this.
</P>
<P>
   Then, right smack in the middle of the crisis, he finally makes
his first serious move in New Hampshire by attracting as First
Figurehead one of the senators who opposes any US role, who says
there is nothing happening in Kosovo that justifies the bombing run
of a single American plane.
</P>
<P>
   In Bush's world, this isn't acknowledged to be a problem, even
in the context of last week's hype. The crisis is seen from Austin
as having absolutely nothing to do with the identity of the
Republican presidential nominee who almost certainly will have been
selected a year from now.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast is with McCain, whose major political move last
week was to postpone his major political move _ the anouncement of
his candidacy with a national tour and another splashdown in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he spent the week earning 10 times the exposure his
announcement would have attracted by becoming the spokesman for the
non-Gregg wing of the Republican Party, arguing that the stakes for
the United States at this moment in post-Cold War history are
gigantic. People heard McCain as much as they heard President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Don't misunderstand. Governor Bush's political No-Big-Dealism
has the strong force of recent history and political common sense
behind it. Prominent endorsers have always had issue differences
with their endorsees. Indeed, in Bush's case, the attraction of
Republicans from multiple perspectives is said to be precisely one
of his candidacy's most appealing qualities.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bush campaign, the Kosovo crisis is the classic
distraction _ no matter what his crowded letterhead of supporting
foreign policy big shots is telling him, and especially no matter
that confronting Slobodan Milosevic over Kosovo was a solemn vow of
Bush Pere seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Point 1: The crisis will have passed well before Republicans
start voting. Point 2: The crisis will have zero impact, even
residually, on the GOP campaign. Point 3: The crisis will only have
impact if something goes horribly wrong, in which case the impact
will be on Al Gore. Point 4: That is an argument for soft-pedaled,
hedged support for a US role and no more. Point 5: Above all, that
is an argument for having the discipline to focus on keeping the
juggernaut rolling _ classic front-runner strategy by possibly the
most dominant front-runner in the modern game.
</P>
<P>
   Family history provides the clincher. The war in the Persian
Gulf had nothing to do with then-President Bush's political
fortune, except to the extent that it tricked Bush Pere into
thinking it would because his huge, post-fighting popularity was so
important in dissuading so many well-known Democrats from entering
the '92 race.
</P>
<P>
   And that makes Governor Bush's well-publicized dissembling
nothing more significant than the Persian Gulf fudge of
then-Governor Clinton, except that Clinton was lucky not to have a
national spotlight on him at the time.
</P>
<P>
   On that basis, Judd Gregg's role as an opponent of US
involvement is inconsequential because the issue itself is
irrelevant to the task ahead. What counts is that New Hampshire's
most popular and most senior elected official is aboard the
letterhead, himself the scion of a locally famous father. And it
counts so much that it was worth offering Gregg the traditional
``national role'' in the Bush effort, just like former governors
John Sununu and Steve Merrill before him. It was especially worth
it because Bush snared Gregg's political organization in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   Can't deny the logic, except that every once in a while logic
doesn't apply to the nomination process.
</P>
<P>
   Through John McCain's prism, the presidential primary stage is
typically dark most days. There may be activity going on, but the
public doesn't notice because the lights are off. But then, without
warning, the lights can come on bright as opening night, and that
is precisely when people pay close attention and make judgments
about the actors.
</P>
<P>
   From McCain's perspective, Kosovo is a classic defining moment _
not just on its own but as part of the deep fault line running
through the party concerning America's role in the world, a concept
that gets all this to economics as well as security policy and
moral purpose. And this is one more moment, the previous one being
abortion, when Governor Bush has failed to communicate except by
calculation.
</P>
<P>
   A year from now, people will look back on last week as a
symptom, maybe a symbol, of two roads in presidential politics
taken by the two men who didn't go to New Hampshire, but were
nonetheless on a well-lit stage. The totally focused front-runner
put another big name on his letterhead. The underdog put forward a
crystal-clear vision of his country's huge stakes in a foreign
policy crisis.

THE DEBATE ABOUT `SPRAWL' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO &UR;  &LR;  -- Vice President Al Gore has defined a major
domestic issue for 2000 and some Republicans have responded
eagerly: ``Sprawl? We're for it.''
</P>
<P>
   In think tanks and partisan periodicals, an ideological war is
underway for the hearts, minds, and car keys of a huge and no
longer silent majority of Americans, suburbanites.
</P>
<P>
   The war is worth fighting if only for the intellectual effects
on both parties. Democrats have historically been unable to stand
prosperity. Issues of growth, planning, and traffic do not stiffen
the sinews or summon up Democratic blood the way work and wages
once did.
</P>
<P>
   For Republicans, champions of the American home and hearth,
focusing on some area other than the bedroom would be healthy. The
garage will do.
</P>
<P>
   Indulging a vice presidential habit, Gore overstates the case
against sprawl. ``A gallon of gas can be used up just driving to
get a gallon of milk,'' he has said, implying that Americans are
not as wise and prudent as, say, Al Gore. (The biggest roadblock
facing Democrats in presidential elections has been the slogan,
``We're from the government and we're here to help you.'')
</P>
<P>
   Gore's plan favors ``smart growth,'' which the Heritage
Foundation calls ``a program in search of a problem,'' arguing that
`` `Smart growth' could be no growth.'' The March 22 cover of
National Review features characters from the TV cartoon ``King of
the Hill'' lined up behind a backyard barbecue with the combative
headline, ``They're OK!''
</P>
<P>
   For decades, suburbia has quietly accumulated political power.
In 1952, Chicago cast 41 percent of the vote in Illinois. In 1996,
its share was 20 percent. The same decline eroded other Democratic
strongholds. New York went from 48 to 31, Detroit from 29 to 8,
Baltimore from 39 to 10, and Boston from 15 to 7 percent of the
state's vote.
</P>
<P>
   As both parties adjust to demographic reality, Steven Hayward of
the Pacific Research Institute of San Francisco, sees an elitist
plot by Democrats. ``The answer is readily apparent: to get us out
of our cars,'' he writes in National Review.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no exaggeration to say that for most smart-growth
advocates, the car is a rolling cigarette, and General Motors is
the moral equivalent of Philip Morris. In `Earth in the Balance,'
of course, Gore wrote that the internal combusion engine `is posing
a mortal threat to the security of every nation that is more deadly
than that of any military enemy we are ever likely to confont
again.' It is this animus against the car that explains why the
smart-growth crowd is fixated on high-density development.''
</P>
<P>
   So Democrats must now pry the cold, dead fingers off the
steering wheel of a typical suburbanite's beloved sports utility
vehicle? The symbolism is not that neat.
</P>
<P>
   Suburbia, one of the great unintended consequences of American
life, is a Republican invention. When President Dwight D.
Eisenhower signed the Defense Interstate Highway Act of 1956, he
launched a massive, if unRepublican, government subsidy that would
help empty cities, destabilize the industrial economy, and create
sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   Today, as suburbia has matured, The New Democrat, published by
the Democratic Leadership Council, devotes an issue to ``The Revolt
in America's Suburbs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From coast to coast, sprawl is being undermined by its own
constituency,'' writes Richard Moe and Carter Wilkie, coauthors of
``Changing Places: Rebuilding Community in the Age of Sprawl.'' Moe
and Wilkie point out that ``Sprawl became the sleeper political
issue of 1998, when voters from California to Cape Cod approved
some ballot initiatives related to growth management.''
</P>
<P>
   Politicians follow election returns. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania
and Christine Whitman of New Jersey are antisprawl Republican
governors. But governors do not inhabit a think-tank world. In the
platforms of 2000, the debate about sprawl will enliven, inform,
and motivate both parties.

BY LUCK, OR GENIUS, CLINTON, NATO GAINING GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If President Clinton had announced before launching air strikes
against Yugoslavia that he would not rule out sending ground
troops, Republicans might have had on their side what they did not
during the impeachment process _ public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   But the tide is turning, and what the public would have rejected
just three weeks ago is looking far more tolerable today.
</P>
<P>
   As if by a stroke of luck, a stroke of political genius, or a
bit of both, there has been in recent days a groundswell of support
by both political parties, as well as by the American people, for
sending ground troops to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Given Clinton's skill at getting out of difficult situations,
the public approval he is now receiving for his handling of NATO's
war against Slobodan Milosevic has to be at least partly attributed
to his own political and diplomatic acumen.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, his ability to turn public opinion to his favor is
sometimes helped by his adversaries sharp tongues and
mean-spiritedness, which is more distasteful to the electorate than
the president's own actions.
</P>
<P>
   This is what apparently has happened during NATO's air
offensive. As NATO stepped up the bombing, Milosevic stepped up his
``ethnic cleansing'' offensive, turning his forced evacuation of
ethnic Albanians from Kosovo into a humanitarian disaster of epic
proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Even Clinton's supporters were initially critical of his policy
and war strategy against Milosevic. Although the heads of the other
NATO countries were deeply involved in planning the offensive, it
was Clinton who was targeted for the most criticism from those
within and outside the United States. When a jet fighter was shot
down on day five of the bombing, support for the strikes eroded
even further.
</P>
<P>
   And when, on day eight, three American soldiers were captured by
Serbian troops, it was viewed by both Clinton supporters and
detractors as a coup for Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   However, Milosevic made the same mistake Clinton's Republican
enemies did with impeachment: He overplayed his hand, threatening
to put the soldiers on trial as war criminals. Clinton regained the
backing of the populace when he demanded the soldiers' release and
emphatically stressed that Milosevic would be held responsible if
anything happened to them.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Milosevic got the message. The media reported a
trial was no longer imminent. Later, as the bombing increased and
spread to Belgrade, Milosevic began calling for a cease-fire and a
limited pullback of his troops.
</P>
<P>
   When the NATO alliance, familiar with Milosevic's self-serving
tactics, rejected the offer, he hinted that the soldiers would be
released. Milosevic began to backtrack on the release when NATO
responded that the soldiers had to be released unconditionally.
Nonetheless, when it appeared Milosevic was seeking some relief
from the constant bombing, Clinton's and NATO's strategy began to
look as if it was making an impact.
</P>
<P>
   One theme throughout this war is that the countries that make up
NATO are united as never before. And much of the credit for this
unity goes to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Television and newspaper images of the hundreds of thousands of
ethnic Albanian refugees gathered in large fields have stunned and
angered the world. At first, the anger was directed at Clinton and
his NATO allies, suggesting that this catastrophe was their fault,
and the air campaign was an utter failure. However, most Americans
began to realize that these events were not the result of NATO's
strategy, but another example of the vicious policies of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   As images of Kosovo refugees _ especially women and children
with little food or shelter _ continue to mark the daily news, the
call for ground troops has become louder and louder, from the halls
of Congress to homes and workplaces across the country.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt there are legitimate questions as to whether the war
plans against Milosevic were thoroughly reviewed, or whether
Milosevic's accelerated ``ethnic cleansing'' was actually
anticipated. But these issues are secondary. What happens now is
what's important.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the offensive against Milosevic appears to be working
well enough for Clinton to continue the current course, even though
he now has support to commit US troops. Not a critical murmur was
uttered when it was announced that 2,000 support troops would
accompany the Apache helicopters being sent to Albania. No matter
how they describe them, these soldiers are the closest thing to, if
not being, ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   If in the coming days Clinton decides that a commitment of
ground troops is, finally, necessary to stop Milosevic, his onetime
critics will probably say that he had no other choice if NATO is to
prevail. And that is, basically, what this has come down to.
America, as part of NATO, cannot afford to lose this war and face
worldwide embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   The goal now is to bring this conflict to a successful end. As
long as Clinton is involved, the odds are that he, along with the
NATO alliance, will prevail.

ABOUT THE TOBACCO MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first checks in the $246 billion settlement between the
cigarette makers and the states will soon be cut, and bureaucrats
and lobbyists are banging their spoons on the table, demanding the
money _ usually in the name of ``the children'' _ for their pet
projects. The loudest clamor comes from those who want rich new
subsidies for antitobacco programs _ everything from don't-smoke TV
commercials to paying firefighters to lecture schoolchildren about
the dangers of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   But amid the din and drone of all this special-interest
pleading, you can also hear voices lifted in support of the
proposition that the only legitimate use for the settlement money
is to repay the taxpayers who advanced it in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tax-and-spenders are salivating at the prospect of $8.1
billion in tobacco-settlement bucks swelling the state treasury for
25 years to come,'' editorializes the Detroit News. ``The lung
lobby can hardly wait to launch yet more anti-smoking programs. But
every penny rightfully belongs back in taxpayers' pockets by way of
a tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
   New York's new US senator, Charles Schumer, urges his state ``to
use $9 billion . . . of the settlement to reduce county property
taxes . . . because this is the amount that rightly belongs to
property taxpayers in the counties outside of New York City who
bore much of the cost of treating tobacco illnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   The head of the Center of the American Experiment, a Minneapolis
think tank, writes: ``Minnesota's $6 billion tobacco free-for-all
is about to begin. Folks, get ready to witness the boondoggle of
the century. Forget the fact that the tobacco lawsuit was waged in
the name of the taxpayers, ostensibly to compensate them for the
smoking-related costs they have borne. At this moment,
organizations ranging from HMOs to ad agencies to schools are lined
up 12 deep to grab a piece of the mind-boggling tobacco windfall
for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, Attorney General Charles Condon is blunt.
``These funds _ the $2.2 billion designated for South Carolina _
are reimbursements _ reimbursements to the taxpayers of our state
for dollars already spent. It would be a terrible injustice if
those funds were used to pay for more government programs and more
bureaucracy, or to grow the government in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   And from Citizens for Limited Taxation in Massachusetts, a
perfect simile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The taxpayers should get back the tax dollars they paid for
Medicaid-funded treatment of smoking-related illnesses,'' says
CLT's executive director, Barbara Anderson. ``We are the aggrieved
party here. We are like an assault victim who pays his medical
bills, pays his lawyer to sue the perpetrator, wins a court
settlement, then learns that the settlement money will be used to
provide self-defense lessons for whoever wants them.''
</P>
<P>
   The states sued the tobacco companies on the theory that they
were entitled to ``reimbursement'' for the losses they incur in
treating smokers who get sick. But there are no losses. Most states
collect far more in tobacco taxes than they pay out in medical
costs to treat smoking-related illnesses. Massachusetts, for
example, spends about $200 million annually on health care for
smokers. But it takes in more than $300 million per year in tobacco
excise and sales taxes. Far from depleting the state treasury,
smokers enrich it with a $100 million annual surplus.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, states can't spend their revenue fast enough these
days; statehouse budgets are running the biggest surpluses in 25
years. To this gusher of money _ all of it confiscated in one form
or another from taxpayers _ comes the added windfall of the tobacco
settlement, which for most states will be roughly equal to the
amount they already collect in cigarette taxes.
</P>
<P>
   These funds belong to the public. State governments have no
defensible claim on them. It was Joe and Jane Taxpayer who laid out
the cash for the expenses now being ``reimbursed;'' it is Joe and
Jane Taxpayer to whom that cash should now be returned. As a matter
of logic and morality, the case for using the tobacco jackpot to
cut taxes is overpowering. No doubt that is why state officials and
antismoking activists keep yelling about ``the children'' and how
Big Tobacco is trying to kill them: anything to keep the subject
from changing to tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   One of the great perversities of the governmental war on smoking
is the extent to which government profits from smoking. Jacob
Sullum highlights the astonishing numbers in the May issue of
Reason magazine. Last year, the tobacco industry's profit on a pack
of cigarettes sold in the United States was 23 cents. On the same
pack, the federal government collected 24 cents in taxes and the
states collected an average of 36 cents. Incredibly, 72 percent of
the net proceeds from tobacco sales goes not to Big Tobacco but to
Big Government.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder even vehemently antismoking politicians never call for
banning cigarettes outright: They don't want to kill the goose that
gives them so many golden eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Arguments can be made for and against tobacco taxes. But the
settlement fund is not a tax. If the attorneys general meant what
they said, it is a reimbursement _ a repayment of money that the
taxpayers originally fronted. When those settlement checks start
coming in, it is those taxpayers to whom they should be endorsed.

FAULKNER'S TOWN HONORS A TOWERING EUDORA WELTY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. _ Eudora Welty once said that sharing a literary
landscape with William Faulkner was like living near a mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Welty weaved a gentle tapestry of words in contrast to
Faulkner's sound and fury, yet in the four decades she has survived
him, she, too, has gained international recognition while winning
their home state's deep affection, which was denied to Faulkner in
his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   When Welty reaches her 90th birthday Tuesday, the celebration in
Mississippi will be as quiet and mannered as one of her novels.
Frail with age, she will more than likely spend the day in her
home, friends say, enjoying the visits of a few companions who drop
by to see her regularly, swapping yarns and laughter.
</P>
<P>
   In Faulkner's hometown, Welty is being honored, in absentia, at
the annual Oxford Conference for the Book this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Though she won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1972, and was
awarded the Medal of Freedom by President Jimmy Carter in 1980
before being inducted into France's Legion d'Honneur in 1996, ``she
is really just now being discovered,'' said Noel Polk, a Welty
scholar and English professor at the University of Southern
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was thought of as female, and somehow inferior to
Faulkner,'' Polk said in a telephone interview. ``But what goes
unsaid is that what lies near a mountain is usually another
mountain. Miss Welty has established herself as a new mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   Welty reigns as the belle of letters in a state that has
produced extraordinary talent. Today, Mississippi writers not only
mention Welty in the same breath with Faulkner, they talk of her
courage during the troubled 1960s, when segregation fell in
sunbursts of freedom marches, bombings, and murders.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's an absolutely wonderful writer,'' said Josephine Haxton,
a novelist who uses the pen name Ellen Douglas. ``But she's also a
steady political person who stood for decency and for the rights of
people in Mississippi and never sought the limelight for herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Haxton, who lives in Welty's neighborhood in Jackson, recalls
that Welty was once asked if she feared the Ku Klux Klan might
attack her home. ``You know,'' Welty replied, ``people who burn
crosses don't usually read The New Yorker.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in The New Yorker that one of Welty's strongest short
stories appeared in 1963, shortly after NAACP leader Medgar Evers
was killed by a sniper a few miles across town in Jackson. Entitled
``Where Is the Voice Coming From?'' it is a narrative told by a man
consumed by racial hatred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I says to my wife,'' the story begins. `` `You can reach and
turn it off. You don't have to set and look at a black nigger face
no longer than you want to, or listen to what you don't want to
hear. It's still a free country.' I reckon that's how I give myself
the idea.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``idea'' was to stalk an NAACP official and shoot him down
in the driveway of his home.
</P>
<P>
   The story was written before the murder was linked to Byron De
La Beckwith, a white supremacist from the Delta, yet the narrator
bears an uncanny resemblance to him.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, shortly after a Mississippi jury convicted Beckwith of
the murder more than 30 years after the killing, Welty was asked
how she had been able to capture Beckwith's personality. She
dismissed her prescience.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment she heard the news of Evers's death, she said,
``We all knew who did it. Because we all knew Beckwiths. It wasn't
necessary to know that man, Beckwith.''
</P>
<P>
   Welty never married. She has lived for nearly 75 years in the
comfortable house her parents built across a tree-lined street from
Belhaven College, a Presbyterian school a few blocks from the state
capitol.
</P>
<P>
   As a young woman, Welty worked for the Works Progress
Administration, one of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal
programs that brought relief to Mississippi. She traveled the
state, taking photographs as evocative of that desperate period as
Walker Evans's images in ``Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.''
</P>
<P>
   Welty's shadow haunts the foreground of one of her most
remarkable pictures, a lonely setting of columns at the ``Ruins of
Windsor,'' all that remained of a plantation mansion destroyed by
fire.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago she was asked if she had planned to use her
shadow to add mood to the photograph. ``Of course not,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her modesty is a characteristic that carries over into her work.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is much less an elitist than Faulkner,'' said Richard
Ford, a prize-winning novelist who grew up in Jackson. ``She's much
better educated than Faulkner. She benefited from coming along
after Faulkner. He established a camp farthest out, and it had a
good effect on her because her work was encouraged to be more
accessible.''
</P>
<P>
   Reading Faulkner is a deep and mysterious exercise, the
equivalent of a Catholic Mass said in Latin. Welty's books are
similarly enriching, but are written with the simple eloquence of a
Methodist service in the church she attended as a child.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his power as a writer, Faulkner was scorned as a
pretentious figure in Oxford. Townspeople never forgave him for
returning from World War I with British airs, false claims of
heroism, and an ensemble of tweedy clothes. They called him ``Count
No Count.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Faulkner was a resident alien,'' said Barry Hannah, a
masterful short story writer who lives in Oxford and teaches at the
University of Mississippi. ``The difference is that Miss Eudora was
a permanent fixture through thick and thin. During the civil rights
horrors, she gave us hope that a decent white artist could survive
in a state that reflected South Africa's values. It took a lot of
guts.''
</P>
<P>
   In an essay published in The Atlantic Monthly in 1965, three
years after Faulkner's death, Welty defended her colleague after a
literary critic declared that Faulkner should be reassessed because
he was, ``after all, only a white Mississippian.''
</P>
<P>
   The books Faulkner left behind could speak volumes in answer,
she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The color of his skin would modify it just about as much as
would the binding of his book. Integrity can be neither lost nor
concealed nor faked nor quenched nor artificially come by nor
outlived, nor, I believe, in the long run denied. Integrity is no
greater and no less today than it was Saturday and will be
tomorrow. It stands outside time.''
</P>
<P>
   Employing her own style, Welty is as lyrical as any of the great
American writers of the 20th century. Elegant passages run through
Welty's prose like golden threads.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Optimist's Daughter,'' her novel that won the Pulitzer
Prize, she portrayed a selfish, small-minded widow:
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps she was forty. There was little even of forty in her
looks except the line of her neck and the backs of her little
square, idle hands. She was boney and blue-veined, as a child she
had very possibly gone undernourished. Her hair was still a
childish tow. It had the tow texture, as if, well rubbed between
the fingers, those curls might have gone to powder. She had round,
country-blue eyes and a little feist jaw.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is better at taking the density of lived experience
that seems imperceptible and making it thrilling,'' Ford said.

   Nearly 40 years younger than Welty, Ford has a boyhood memory of
his mother pointing out the famous lady while shopping at a Jitney
Jungle Supermarket in Jackson. He did not meet Welty until years
later, but became a steadfast friend.
</P>
<P>
   At a literary gathering shortly after he won the 1995 Pulitzer
Prize for his own novel, ``Independence Day,'' Ford paid homage to
Welty by choosing to read from her work rather than his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire her terrifically,'' he said the other day. ``And she
is a hero for a lot of women writers who were faced with a decision
to go at it alone.''

TEEN LIKES, DISLIKES SET THE AGENDA FOR THE REST OF US 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   There are more teenagers now than at any time in our history:
30.9 million Americans between the ages of 12 and 19. Their rank is
expected to swell to 33.6 million in 2005 as the children of the
baby boomers come of age, the so-called ``echo generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Teenagers' ability to shape the culture, or to determine what
sells, is nothing new. But the degree of their influence is, as
today's teens set a wider agenda than any generation before them.
</P>
<P>
   It's not only in Hollywood, where stars selected by teenagers _
Adam Sandler and Leonardo DiCaprio _ have created box office
benchmarks in movies like ``The Waterboy'' and ``Titanic.'' ``We
picked our stars and these kids are picking their own,'' said Casey
Silver, former chairman of Universal Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not only in the media, where Teen People magazine, just
a year old, has a circulation of more than 1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the consumer culture, teenagers are making their
likes and dislikes known by what they will spend their money on _
and they have plenty to spend. They contributed some $141 billion
to the US economy last year, according to Teenage Research
Unlimited, a consulting firm known as TRU that tracks spending
patterns. Without mortgages or college loans to pay off, teens are
free to spend what they have. On average, a teenager spends $99 a
week, $28 from their parents, $71 from their own money. On average,
teenagers receive $77 a week from working and allowance.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing to teens has never been so pervasive, says Peter
Zollo, president of TRU and author of ``Wise Up to Teens: Insights
into Marketing and Advertising to Teenagers,'' a book on the
subject. ``It blows me away and I have been at this for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Teenagers ``have more power to set trends than they did
before,'' says Whiton S. Paine, a developmental psychologist and
president of the Pennsylvania-based market research firm KidToKid.
``Their ability to set trends and pass information on is
exaggerated because of the Internet. Now, kids get on the Internet
and start telling everyone (even companies) what is hot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old style was that trends started on the West Coast or the
inner city and then traveled. Now, they can start anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Teens are the ones who decided that jeans are out _ and thus
sent Levi Strauss's operations into a slump _ and who put Delia's
on the map almost overnight, rocketing the girls' clothing catalog
from $5 million in sales in 1995 to $170 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Teenagers' spending is spread across every industry, specialists
say. Parents and grandparents turn to teenagers for advice on
computer, audio, and even automobile purchases. And no teens have
more responsibility than those who are latch-key children.
</P>
<P>
   While both parents work, or a single parent does, many more
teens are doing shopping that once was the domain of the parent.
Grocery shopping, for example, is normal for most teens. TRU says
half of all male teens do some grocery shopping for the family on a
weekly basis and 60 percent of the girls do.
</P>
<P>
   TRU has for 17 years produced biannual reports, based on a poll
of 2,000 select teenagers, on what the 12 to 19 crowd is doing and
thinking. The list of companies who heed TRU's research reads like
the Fortune 500: Coke, Pepsi, Nike, Reebok, Calvin Klein, Levi's,
the Gap, Procter &AMP; Gamble, Disney, 20th Century Fox, Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We measure everything from what they are buying, what are
their favorite commercials, the coolest brands, to what they like
to do with their families,'' says R. Michael Wood, TRU's director
of research.
</P>
<P>
   Because they are a growing _ and free-spending _ demographic,
determining what it is that teens like and want is becoming a big
business in itself, albeit a tricky one.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, Triple Dot Communications, and its affiliate,
Y-Access, maintains a database of more than 1,000 teenagers, and
positions itself as a communications and marketing agency attuned
to the 12 to 24 market.
</P>
<P>
   Triple Dot's Tru Pettigrew, 30, spends about half his time
talking with teenagers in Boston and around the country, finding
out what they like. It is all part of Triple Dot's effort to help
clients reach that lucrative market.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Pettigrew was in New York talking to teens. On
Thursday, he approached a group in a South Boston playground,
quickly grabbed the basketball they were playing with, and deftly
insinuated himself into the game and the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going on a date this weekend and you got to keep me hip
and cool. What should I wear?'' Pettigrew asks. The answer: FUBU,
said one teenager. Some others shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   But over the next hour, he harvests a wealth of information
about what Sean Flaherty, 16, Rose Broderick, 15, Jean Valentin,
14, and several other teenagers think about everything from
clothes, to music, to commercials to magazines, moving seamlessly
from music to sports to the source of the group's money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of Abercrombie,'' says Sean, complaining that all
the brand's clothes are the same. Jean says black will be the hot
color this summer, and that he reads the magazine Slam.
</P>
<P>
   The questions are not for any particular client. Instead,
Pettigrew will write a report about the afternoon that will be
circulated in-house. When the session is over, Pettigrew reaches
into a duffle bag and pulls out CDs and Converse apparel for the
teenagers. They accept the gifts.
</P>
<P>
   But teenagers _ who have been the targets of marketers since
they were in diapers _ are savvy, discerning customers. They are
more street-smart than their predecessors, and don't always accept
whatever comes their way. If they don't like a product, they find a
way to say so.
</P>
<P>
   Many use e-mail to tell off companies, or use a company's 800
number, says Marta Loeb, president of Y-Access. ``In all my years
of market research, I have never seen a group so expressive and
comfortable with having that voice.'' For example, Delia's gets
some 6,000 e-mails a day from teens commenting about its products
or making suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every industry is targeting teenagers and children,
says James McNeal, a professor of marketing at Texas A&AMP;M University
who has studied marketing to children for the last 36 years. And
when one company in an industry does, the competition quickly
follows.
</P>
<P>
   Zollo says the barrage of marketing has made teens tougher to
reach. ``They have developed firewalls. . . . It can be tough to
get through to them in a relevant way.''
</P>
<P>
   Quieter marketing, such as sponsoring music acts, or a
skiboarding contest, or getting influential teenagers to wear your
product, stands a good chance, he says. ``You have to be pervasive
in their lives and get under the radar screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether under the radar screen or in your face, marketing to
teenagers is expected to increase because of the group's size and
spending power. So parents, next time you ground your teenager,
think again. You might be responsible for bringing the nation's
longest peacetime economic expansion to a grinding halt.

ON PAST AND FUTURE, NO SHORTAGE OF SURPRISES FOR SCHOLARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN YEMMA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ It was only last month, but it feels like a
lifetime since Morton Abramowitz was working behind the scenes at
the Kosovo peace talks, a diplomat trying intently to head off war.
</P>
<P>
   Every day since, he says, has been a surprise _ the ``rude and
insulting'' Serb reaction to the Kosovo autonomy plan, the
breakdown of diplomacy, NATO's military inability to bring Slobodan
Milosevic to his knees.
</P>
<P>
   Looking weary and a little worried last week, Abramowitz, a
former US assistant secretary of state who advised the Kosovo
Albanian delegation in the peace talks, sat in a classroom
describing a series of unanticipated events and unforeseen
reactions, and an unpredictable future for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   On Milosevic's hard line: ``I was immensely surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``ethnic cleansing'' in Kosovo: ``I certainly never expected
a systematic expulsion of the people of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   On bombing: ``The view that Milosevic might change his mind
after he had a whiff of gunpowder was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   It was just one diplomat's view, delivered at a seminar at
Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Abramowitz, now with the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, was not
the architect of US policy toward Kosovo. But his recounting of the
slide toward war since late March made clear that the big surprise
of the conflict has been the sheer number of surprises.
</P>
<P>
   US and European diplomats did not know how events would unfold.
Nor could they now say with confidence how the crisis would end _
whether Milosevic could forced to capitulate, pull his forces out
of Kosovo, welcome back the refugees, and allow an international
force to police the province.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the big questions being asked in foreign ministries
and at think tanks on both sides of the Atlantic deal with
far-reaching security concerns as the conflict rolls toward Week
Four: Can NATO hold together? Will Russia remain on the sidelines?
Will public opinion remain supportive? How will the conflict end?
</P>
<P>
   Following is the consensus view of a group of analysts:
</P>
<P>
   --NATO: So far, the alliance is holding, but if the air war
drags on, or ground troops are introduced, there could be problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a problem _ not yet,'' said Robert E. Hunter, US
ambassador to NATO from 1993 to '98 and now an analyst at the Rand
Corp. think tank in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tactic that Milosevic is pursuing is precisely to split
the allies, which is what the call for an Easter cease-fire was all
about. . . . That's not been a problem up to now. But what about .
. . four weeks from now?''
</P>
<P>
   If NATO takes significant casualties or introduces ground
forces, Hunter says, unity could crack. But Hunter sees no
alternative to keeping pressure on Milosevic and turning down
partial peace proposals.
</P>
<P>
   --Russia: Again, this is not a problem yet. Although anti-NATO
rhetoric is becoming strident in Russia, specialists say it is
unlikely that Moscow will make a bold move to aid the Serbs or
challenge NATO. On Tuesday, Secretary of State Madeleine K.
Albright will meet with the Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov,
to try to keep US-Russian relations from deteriorating further.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Russia, there is almost universal condemnation of the
NATO action, said Michael McFaul, a senior associate and Russia
specialist at the Carnegie Endowment. As a result, no one Russian
faction can gain advantage by playing on the anger.
</P>
<P>
   What that implies, however, is that no viable pro-Western,
prodemocracy politicians are left in Russia, he added. ``Democrats
are going to lose no matter what. The Kosovo issue makes no
difference there.''
</P>
<P>
   --Opinion: Polls indicate that in both the United States and
Europe, support for the air war runs high, and that there is
increasing approval for a possible ground mission. Richard Sobel, a
political scientist at Harvard's Kennedy School, conducted a study
of American attitudes on foreign intervention, which was published
last month. He concluded that the public will back intervention if
it involves a multinational operation and is in a part of the world
that touches the nation's ``vital interest.'' The NATO operation he
says, fits those criteria.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and European leaders do not have to worry
about opinion going soft in the next few weeks, Sobel said, unless
casualties are high. Even then, public support would not disappear
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   --Military options: For now, Clinton and other leaders have
weathered criticism for ruling out use of ground troops. But to win
the war, many military analysts say, NATO troops will have to go
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it is possible to put off the day of
reckoning,'' said Michael O'Hanlon, a military and security
specialist at the Brookings Institution in Washington. ``Every day
counts. We should be sending a vanguard force to Italy right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Although NATO has increased the number of soldiers going into
Albania and has announced that Apache attack helicopters would be
on the way by next week, force levels are still nothing like what
would would be needed in an invasion. US and European officials
continue to say NATO forces will not enter Kosovo except in a
``permissive'' environment _ that is, only with the cooperation of
Yugoslav leaders after they have acquiesced to NATO demands.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing campaign, then, is almost certain to remain NATO's
main strategy to bring Milosevic around. So far, Operation Allied
Force is costing $20 million to $40 million a day, according to an
independent estimate by the Center for Strategic and Budgetary
Assessment. At that rate, NATO has spent around $500 million to
date. There's no sign that the costs so far are straining the NATO
budget, but if the war were to drag on, its expense could become an
issue.
</P>
<P>
   --End game: This baffles most analysts. Clinton and NATO leaders
are adamant that they will not let Milosevic win a halt to the
bombing by offering half-measures. They want full compliance with
the conditions they laid down in the Rambouillet accords that
Milosevic scorned. To settle for less would be a defeat for NATO.
But for Milosevic to agree to those conditions _ especially the
international force in Kosovo _ would be surrender in the eyes of
most Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, administration voices made the stakes higher by
beginning to say that Milosevic must be removed from office.
Abramowitz, for instance, said that negotiating with Milosevic now
is out of the question: ``We must insist on his departure.'' That
will mean a hard fight, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more the US has badgered and pressured, the more Milosevic
has dug his heels in,'' said Minton Goldman, an East European
specialist at Northeastern University. ``It's a matter of face.
When it comes to nationalism, people do go crazy. We'll have to see
it through to the end, but we'll find many Serbs tired of
fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   With Milosevic's very survival at stake, however, the biggest
surprise of all at this point would be a speedy end to the crisis.

 TAKES-BOS  
 (Includes steroids sidebar)  
 (Eds.: IgE is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than 5 million children in the United States have asthma,
and despite the intensifying efforts of schools, public health
officials, physicians and community groups, too many are falling
through the cracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see a lot of patients who are undertreated,'' said Pamela
Fallon, a nurse practitioner at Boston Medical Center's adult
pulmonary clinic. ``They've never gotten on top of their asthma''
with aggressive treatment that could keep them relatively free of
symptoms and acute flareups, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Asthma can't be cured. But with today's best treatments, most
patients can avoid disruption of their lives. Unfortunately,
treatment often involves taking a number of drugs and working
diligently to avoid environmental substances that trigger symptoms.
Surveys show that many people don't maintain the necessary routines
in the long term.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the problem is that life is complicated,'' said Dr.
Christopher Fanta, clinical director of pulmonary and critical care
medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital and director of the
Partners Asthma Center.
</P>
<P>
   Nine year-old Levell Gillard, a pupil at Mattahunt Elementary
School in Boston, had been suffering from asthma symptoms for many
months. But his family and living situation were in flux and his
symptoms of wheezing and shortness of breath took a back seat.
</P>
<P>
   Levell's asthma was waking him at night, bothering him at
school, on the playground, and _ worst of all _ when he rehearsed
with his ``positive rap'' musical group.
</P>
<P>
   When he tried to sing, he wheezed, coughed and sniffled.
``That's when the bell went off'' that he might need treatment,
said his aunt, Angela Gethers, despite the fact that his primary
care doctor never seemed to take much notice of his asthma.
</P>
<P>
   Even patients in regular care may not be receiving what's now
considered optimal therapy.
</P>
<P>
   When Gethers _ with whom he now lives _ brought Levell to the
asthma clinic at Boston Medical Center this past winter, lung
function tests revealed that his airways were inflamed and severely
blocked: even after he inhaled a drug to open the airways, they
remained constricted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get this under control,'' said Dr. Suzanne
Steinbach, director of the pediatric allergy-respiratory division
at BMC, who eventually sent Levell and his aunt home with a long
list of drugs and inhaler equipment he would need, including
cortisone drugs to begin attacking his runaway asthma immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbach gets many young patients like this who need more
aggressive treatment, often referred by a school nurse or a primary
care doctor. Many parents don't take action when they notice that
their child wheezes or can't participate in activities ``because
they think that's the way asthma is,'' says Steinbach. ``Our job is
to tell them, no, it could be better-controlled''
</P>
<P>
   After a few months of taking the drugs as Steinbach prescribed,
and using a ``peak flow meter'' to monitor his lung function,
Levell said recently he was doing much better _ and his singing was
benefiting as well.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, most patients could do well if they were treated
according to national guidelines issued two years ago, and aimed at
meeting goals set by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute,
say asthma specialists. The goals are ambitious but, in theory,
achievable in all but the most severe and intractable cases. The
goals include keeping asthma from disrupting sleep, eliminating the
need to miss school or work, reducing emergency medical visits and
hospitalizations, making it possible for people to exercise, and
maintaining normal, or nearly normal, lung function.
</P>
<P>
   To reach these goals, the NHLBI set out several recommendations
on how to treat patients with varying degrees of asthma.
</P>
<P>
   People who have mild episodes of chest tightness, wheezing and
shortness of breath should take short-acting inhaled drugs called
beta-2 agonists, like albuterol.
</P>
<P>
   If they have symptoms like this more than twice a week, the
guidelines say, asthmatics should be on long-term ``controller''
medications that dampen the inflammation in the lungs. This
guideline probably applies to about half the nation's estimated
17.3 million asthmatics.
</P>
<P>
   There are several types of controller drugs, but inhaled
steroids ``are the most effective long-term control medication for
asthma,'' say the guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Today's drug regimens, which are demanding and have
uncomfortable side effects, may give way to new ones as scientists
find ways to target specific links in the inflammation process.
Most current drugs have a broad, non-specific effect.
</P>
<P>
   In just the last couple of years, drugs called leukotriene
inhibitors are making it possible for some patients to control
their symptoms long-term with pills instead of _ or in addition to
_ inhaled compounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the first designer therapy,'' said Dr. Jeffrey
Drazen, chief of the pulmonary division at Brigham and Women's
Hospital. What he means is that the leukotriene inhibitors home in
on specific molecules in the inflammation process, and are
virtually free of side effects. However, they don't work for all
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Other drugs under development are aimed at antibodies called
IgE, which are spewed into the bloodstream in many asthmatics.
Specific white blood cells called eosinophils are still another
target for new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   All asthmatics should routinely use peak flow meters to
anticipate when an episode of obstructed breathing may be coming
on. These meters are simple devices that the patient blows into,
moving a marker along a measured distance that indicates how
rapidly he or she can blow air out. Some of the meters can now
transmit their readings directly to doctors' offices.
</P>
<P>
   This more aggressive stance on monitoring and treatment reflects
that ``the focus in asthma now has changed to altering the course
of the disease'' not just relieving symptoms, said Dr. Stanley J.
Szefler, an asthma specialist at National Jewish Medical and
Research Center in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   However, there are few if any signs yet that these guidelines
and goals are turning the tide in the asthma epidemic.

 UNDATED: ... asthma epidemic.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year there was a sobering reminder of this from a large
survey, called Asthma in America, sponsored by Glaxo Wellcome Inc.,
the pharmaceutical company, and administered to 2,509 adults who
had asthma or were parents of children with asthma. More than 700
health care providers were also surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   The survey revealed that nearly a third of asthma patients were
awakened at night by their symptoms. Nearly half of children with
asthma missed school because of the disease in the past year, and
25 percent of adults missed some work.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one-third of children with asthma made emergency room
visits in the previous year, and 41 percent of all people with
asthma sought urgent medical care. One-fourth to one-half of the
asthmatics said they were limited in their social, physical or
sports activities.
</P>
<P>
   The backbone of asthma treatment, specialists say, is an
individual plan worked out between the doctor and patient in the
context of an ongoing relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Besides drugs, the plan usually requires the patient to figure
out what's triggering symptoms, and then to get rid of or avoid
those allergens and irritants.
</P>
<P>
   This means, in the case of people allergic to dust mites and
animals (very common triggers), stripping the sleeping area of
fabrics and objects that harbor dust mites -- microscopic bugs that
live in dust. Pillows and mattresses must be covered with special
materials, and bedding washed in hot water once a week.
</P>
<P>
   Pets are a major problem: in most cases, physicians say they
should be gotten rid of, but children often refuse. At a minimum,
they should be kept out of the sleeping area. Patients are advised
to vacuum frequently using special bags for their machines; to wear
a mask while cleaning, and, in some cases, to get an air-filtering
machine.
</P>
<P>
   Even well-meaning patients get fed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all-consuming,'' said Margaret MacNally, a Westport woman
who has stripped her bedroom and other living areas of books,
plants upholstered furniture and curtains and put special covers on
mattresses and pillows to reduce her exposure to dust mites and
other irritants.
</P>
<P>
   And patients often fail to follow their medication routines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to understand,'' said Dr. George O'Connor, director
of the adult asthma program at BMC. ``It's hard to stay faithful to
taking regular or twice-daily medications,'' he added. ``And once
they're feeling well, they tend to put their inhalers aside and the
benefits wear off and their asthma gets bad again.''
</P>
<P>
   Patients find it hard to really grasp the need for both
long-term and short-term medication, say O'Connor and others. The
long-term anti-inflammatory drugs _ the inhaled steroids,
nedocromil, theophylline and others _ bring no immediate relief. So
patients may gradually stop taking them, and instead overuse the
short-acting beta-2-agonists that open their airways but don't
fight the chronic inflammation.
</P>
<P>
   And in the inner city, the obstacles may loom even larger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people don't have any access to health care except
neighborhood clinics or the emergency room, and they won't get
continuity of care,'' said Ellie Thornton, head of a community
outreach asthma program at Howard University School of Medicine in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   For those without health insurance, preventive care is an
unaffordable luxury. ``You only go to the physician when there's a
problem. The doctor writes a prescription for a $40 drug and a $55
inhaler, and what do you do? You get a quick fix until you can't
breathe again, and then you go back to the doctor,'' Thornton said.
</P>
<P>
   For these reasons, making a dent in the asthma problem calls for
stronger patient-doctor relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a chronic disease like asthma, there has to be a very
rich exchange between physician and patient, so the physician
understands enough about the asthma episodes'' to make the right
diagnosis and treatment plan, said Noreen M. Clark, dean of the
School of Public Health at the University of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The newly begun Inner City Asthma Study in Boston and other
cities is testing, among other things, a close monitoring of
patients and their families by doctors and nurses, said O'Connor at
BMC. He and Steinbach are co-principal investigators of the study.
</P>
<P>
   Health professionals are calling the families every two months
and asking about their symptoms, their medication and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Another part of the study sends health workers to the homes of
patients, providing expertise and equipment for reducing patients'
exposure to dust mites, cockroach debris, molds, and other
triggers.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kevin Weiss, an asthma specialist at Rush Presbyterian
Medical Center in Chicago, says efforts like these are necessary,
but change isn't easy to effect. ``It's not access to knowledge
that makes a difference,'' said Weiss. ``It's trying to motivate
change at a very local level _ right down in the (medical)
practice.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
USING STEROIDS (sidebar) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many people are confused about treating asthma with steroids _
is it safe? Will it slow my child's growth?
</P>
<P>
   Concern heightened last year after the Food and Drug
Administration directed a labeling change on inhaled steroid drugs
_ commonly used to control inflammation in asthma patients _
because of some evidence that it might slow growth in children or
increase the risk of cataracts.
</P>
<P>
   The answers to these concerns aren't entirely in, and last year
the FDA ruled that the drugs had to be labeled with a warning about
possible effects on growth. The inhaled steroids are drugs like
Pulmacort, Flovent, Azmacort, Aerobid, Vanceril and Beclovent,
which are delivered only to the lungs and aren't absorbed by the
rest of the body.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FDA saw some subtle signs'' of slowed growth in research
studies, ``not major effects,'' said Dr. Stanley Szefler at the
National Jewish Hospital. He said that only children with the most
severe asthma cases need to receive high doses of the inhaled
steroids that could conceivably affect growth. ``Treatment should
be based on controlling symptoms, and using the lowest effective
dose that controls symptoms,'' said Szefler.
</P>
<P>
   And to parents worried about using the steroids, he points out
that severe, untreated asthma itself can interfere with growth.
</P>
<P>
   While further studies may resolve the question more precisely,
Szefler and most other specialists say parents shouldn't avoid
giving their children inhaled steroids, as long as the physician
monitors the child's growth rate twice or more each year.

HUMANS FUELING SKATE'S DECLINE BIOLOGISTS WARN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Homely and obscure, barndoor skates never attracted much
attention as they cruised the ocean floor off the New England
coast. When these sting ray-like creatures turned up in fishing
nets, most fishermen just chucked their carcasses overboard because
almost no one eats them.
</P>
<P>
   But now the barndoor skate could earn the dubious distinction of
becoming the first saltwater fish that humans have driven to
extinction in modern times, an international group of biologists
warn. The same fishing crisis that decimated the cod on Georges
Bank, they say, has almost wiped out the humble skate as well.
</P>
<P>
   Because so many fishermen unintentionally kill barndoor skates,
the biologists estimated that their numbers have fallen by more
than 90 percent since the 1950s, leaving Georges Bank as one of the
barndoor skate's last known strongholds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody was trying to eliminate barndoor skates. We're losing
them because nobody watched for impacts of what we're doing,'' said
Elliott Norse, president of the Marine Conservation Biology
Institute in Redmond, Wash., who organized a meeting of biologists
in Boston last month that resulted in this week's warning about
barndoor skates, one of several skate species.
</P>
<P>
   If the barndoor skate does survive, its days of obscurity may
soon be over. Two environmental groups have petitioned the National
Marine Fisheries Service to list the fish as an endangered species,
which likely would lead to new limits on fishing on Georges Bank,
where thousands of square miles are already closed to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're throwing everything at us now,'' complained Malvin
Kvilhaug, owner of three Fairhaven-based scallop boats. He
suggested that environmentalists are using the skates' plight to
block fishermen from harvesting scallops on Georges Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS),
mindful of the potential harm to the region's fishing industry, say
they need more information to develop a plan to help the skates,
and they have appealed for a calm, unemotional debate.
</P>
<P>
   But some environmentalists say the agency can't be trusted to
protect the skates, and are already threatening to seek a court
order forcing the agency to do more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We maintain that NMFS has adopted a pro-extinction policy for
marine wildlife, and is literally the fox guarding the chicken
coup,'' said Max Strahan of Boston-based Green World, known for his
provocative tactics and rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the barndoor skate, a relative of the shark, is an
innocent bystander in the fishing crisis. Fast swimmers that grow
up to five feet long, skates live near the ocean bottom in many of
the same areas as cod, scallops and other commercially valuable
seafoods, where they can be swept into fishermen's nets and scallop
dragging gear as they pass.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other types of skate that are increasingly popular at
upscale restaurants, people historically have not eaten barndoor
skates. As a result, biologists in the US and Canada paid limited
attention to their population decline, often not even keeping track
of how many are caught.
</P>
<P>
   But, last year, a pair of researchers at Dalhousie University in
Nova Scotia found that the barndoor skate population had declined
by up to 25 percent a year from the 1950s until recently in the
waters from Newfoundland to southern New England. Barndoor skates
have not been seen in 20 years in some places, while numbers had
been reduced by 99 percent in others.
</P>
<P>
   ``The species almost went extinct without anyone noticing it,''
said Ransom Myers, co-author of the skate paper, published last
year in Science, and a signer of the biologists' statement on the
skates' decline.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Serchuk, a biologist at the National Marine Fisheries
Service in Woods Hole, also signed the warning, but he said that
recent federal surveys offer ``a glimmer of hope,'' an increase in
skates on Georges Bank since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   However, the skate rebound on Georges Bank may actually bolster
efforts to protect the skates. The increase roughly coincides with
the collapse of codfishing on the bank, and a steep drop in
fishing. As a result, some researchers and activists suggest it
shows the payback from limiting fishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's required now is a very careful and very deliberate
evaluation of the data that we have on the barndoor skate,'' said
Serchuk. His agency will have a year to determine whether the skate
is endangered, and, meanwhile, NMFS will continue research into the
fish's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the agency's decision, the skate debate reflects
the increasingly complex issues descending on fishermen as
fisheries biologists take a broader view of life under the sea.
After years of focusing on commercial fisheries, biologists are
increasingly turning to other creatures from sponges to right
whales that may be harmed by fishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly we're not keeping our finger on the sea's pulse,''
said Norse. ``The drastic decline of the barndoor skate says we
need refuges in the sea where wildlife can live, grow and reproduce
. . . without being killed off.''

WHY DO MOSQUITO BITES SWELL AND ITCH? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. When a mosquito bites you, why does it leave a bump, and why
does it bleed sometimes?
</P>
<P>
   A.B., J.S., D.S., Mattapan, Mass.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Putting it as politely as possible, it's because they spit
into your skin while they're looking for the best place to suck
your blood.
</P>
<P>
   Mosquito saliva is a fascinatingly complex mix of chemicals.
When the insect lands, after finding you by the scent of carbon
dioxide from your breath, lactic acid on your skin, and even by
your infrared heat signature, it pokes its probe into your skin
several times while looking for an arteriole or venule (mini-artery
or vein) from which to draw its moist meal. As it does, the bug
injects saliva, which contains an anesthetic so you don't feel
yourself being poked and slap the little bugger.
</P>
<P>
   The saliva also contains an anti-coagulant to stop the blood
from clotting while the mosquito samples a taste from each spot.
When it finds the right one, it bores in again and this time a
vasodilator in the saliva widens the passageway, increasing the
blood flow.
</P>
<P>
   All those foreign chemicals in the saliva triggers our immune
system. When we're young, we respond with a part of the immune
system that releases histamines, which makes the cells in the
lining of our blood vessels spread apart, letting fluid out into
the skin where it can attack the foreign chemicals. That fluid
causes swelling and itching. After we've been bitten enough and
after our immune systems have matured, a different kind of antibody
carries the saliva off to macrophages, which are like microscopic
garbage disposers in our blood stream that destroy invading
substances. That's why children get bigger bumps from mosquitoes
than adults do.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why do tulips peter out after one spring but daffodils
multiply and rebloom?
</P>
<P>
   DM, Northampton, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Blame it on their bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   Professor of Horticulture August DeHertogh of North Carolina
State University, one of the leading experts in the world on bulbs,
says tulips and daffodils are both true bulbs, but their growth and
development cycles are different as night and day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tulip reproduces by annual bulb replacement,'' he says.
``Each spring, as the tulip bulb is sending up its flower and
foliage above, it's starting next year's bulb, a daughter down
below. By the end of the season, the mother bulb is used up, and
the daughter has grown and stored enough food to start next year's
tulip.''
</P>
<P>
   But lots of things can keep the daughter bulb from getting big
enough to get the flower going again the following year:
</P>
<P>
   If the daughter doesn't get big enough to be next year's Mom,
the tulip behaves more like an annual than a perennial and dies
off.
</P>
<P>
   Compare that to the robust regenerative strategy of the
daffodil. Their bulbs last for three to four years. They're not all
used up in one growing season. A daffodil can survive one or two
bad growing seasons. They're more tolerant of a wider range of
growing conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Daffodils have poisons in their foliage. Animals don't eat them,
so they can manufacture and store energy longer.
</P>
<P>
   And their bulbs have three or more ``cloves,'' each of which
will send up a shoot, compared with the all-or-nothing one-piece
tulip bulb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some cultivated varieties of tulips have a greater genetic
ability to produce large daughters and they'll come back better,''
DeHertogh says. ``But in general, tulips just are not as naturally
perennialized as daffodils.''

RESEARCH PROBES VARIED FACTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After the fall of the Berlin Wall a decade ago, researchers
compared asthma rates in East Germany, where outdated factories
belched pollution into the skies, with the rates in more affluent,
less polluted West Germany. Surely, they thought, the East would
have far more asthmatics.
</P>
<P>
   But they were wrong. East Germans had less asthma _ although
they had more bronchitis _ while in West Germany, there were more
sufferers of asthma and allergies.
</P>
<P>
   This is just one of many intriguing _ and sometimes perplexing _
studies that leave asthma specialists debating the reasons for the
worldwide asthma epidemic. Many factors appear to contribute, but
there's not enough evidence to link any one of them conclusively to
the disease.
</P>
<P>
   It's been especially difficult to single out potential causes
that have changed over the past 20 or 25 years, when asthma rates
began to take off. Since the increase has been sharpest among
inner-city residents, and children in particular, many studies have
focused on them.
</P>
<P>
   What is known today is that asthma is fundamentally an
inflammatory disease, and emotional factors, such as stress, are no
longer considered important causes, but they can certainly worsen
existing asthma.
</P>
<P>
   Air pollution in general is ``absolutely not'' the answer, said
Dr. Scott Weiss, director of respiratory and environmental
epidemiology at the Channing Laboratory at Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Boston. He points out that U.S. pollution rates have
fallen while asthma rates have climbed, and areas of China with
heavily polluted skies have relatively low asthma rates.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, there's plenty of evidence that particulate
air pollution, diesel fumes, and other pollutants worsen the
symptoms of people with asthma.
</P>
<P>
   One intriguing theory about the rise of asthma in developed
countries is that infants and toddlers are exposed to fewer and
fewer infections that challenge their immune systems. As a result,
the immune responses of children today may develop along a
different path; thus they are more likely to respond in an allergic
way to substances, like pollen and dust mites, that aren't really
dangerous. But the reaction itself becomes harmful if it leads to
asthma symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like you have this cannon and nowhere to shoot
it,'' Weiss said. ``We've eliminated all these infections (in
childhood) and your immune system is out there looking for things
to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Could indoor pollutants in the increasing number of
tightly-sealed buildings be to blame? Perhaps, but some researchers
point out that people in the inner city probably don't live in the
kind of modern, well-sealed structures that are implicated in
``sick-building'' syndromes. Children would presumably be less
vulnerable to sick building complaints than adults, who are more
likely to work in modern office buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas Platts-Mills, head of asthma and allergic diseases at
the University of Virginia School of Medicine, has been searching
for lifestyle culprits that have changed over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to suburban children, he said, those in the inner city
are more likely to play indoors and to become obese. ``I think
what's happened is you have a population that is getting more
exposure (to dust mites and cockroach droppings), but also has
given up outdoor exercise, and that combination is disastrous.''
</P>
<P>
   There is some evidence linking obesity to asthma susceptibility,
though the exact mechanism isn't yet known.
</P>
<P>
   It is known that some people are genetically more susceptible to
asthma than others. But now researchers in Boston and New York are
wondering if the amount of allergens a child is exposed to _ not
only in infancy but even in the womb _ could be the decisive factor
in whether the individual later develops asthma.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Gold, a researcher at the Channing Laboratory at Brigham
and Women's Hospital, is studying children in 499 families that are
afflicted with asthma in various areas of Boston. She and her
colleagues are measuring the levels of dust mites, cockroach
debris, cat dander, fungi, and other allergens in the homes. The
infants will be monitored for several years to see whether those
exposed to higher levels of allergens develop asthma at a greater
rate than those who had lower amounts in their environment.
</P>
<P>
   By studying these very early risk factors, said Gold, it may be
possible to show that cleaning up the home environment can actually
prevent even those children with a genetic predisposition from
developing asthma.
</P>
<P>
   In Weiss' view, evidence is converging that asthma is similar to
other chronic, multifactorial diseases of Western culture like
diabetes, coronary heart disease, and high blood pressure: all of
them have a genetic component that's triggered by various factors
like diet, stress, obesity, lack of physical activity, and so
forth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to crack this in the next five years,''
predicted Weiss. With scientists' rapidly improving ability to find
genes and proteins that influence health and disease, he said, ``we
may really get a handle on what's happening here.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   At age 13, Steven D'Agostino is shackled to a tedious regimen of
daily drugs and inhalers, limits on his activities, and a bedroom
so stripped down and stark his family calls it ``The Cell.''
</P>
<P>
   But even these strict measures can't always prevent the dreaded
onset of an acute asthma attack, when his chest tightens and he
struggles to breathe. Steven's worst episode, in 1996, put him in
Children's Hospital in Boston for over a week, with a breathing
tube down his throat and a ventilator supplying air as massive
doses of drugs were pumped into his veins.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't talk about it much, but recently, the eighth-grader
recently let the nightmarish memories take shape in a poem. ``In
the dark of the night/another ambulance arrives/Taken from one
hospital to another/losing the fight for air,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Once at Children's, he continues, there was ``The sound of tears
drowned out by the machines of life'' in the intensive care unit.
His mother, Donna, remembers anxious hours when Steven was so
exhausted by his struggle for air that ``he didn't even have the
strength to cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Acute, life-threatening crises like these are the most visible
and dramatic features of asthma, the chronic, inflammatory lung
disease that's rising at epidemic rates in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Since the early 1980s, the incidence of asthma _ which had
previously been dropping _ has soared. The sharpest rise has been
among children, who make up about one-third of asthma patients.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the past few years has the urgency and seriousness of
the asthma problem begun to attract wide attention and new efforts
to attack it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really one of the most important and alarming problems
in child health,'' said Dr. Irwin Redlener, president of the
nonprofit Children's Health Fund in New York City. ``It has snuck
up on us and the reasons aren't entirely understood,'' added
Redlener, who also heads community pediatrics at Montefiore Medical
Center.
</P>
<P>
   The incidence of asthma has risen more than 75 percent in the
United States since 1980, and a startling 160 percent in children
under four. An estimated 17.3 million Americans now have asthma,
and deaths, while fortunately not common, have also increased to
over 5,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the sickness and many of the deaths from asthma are
considered preventable. Yet, despite improved diagnosis and
treatment, the asthma problem overall seems only to be worsening.
</P>
<P>
   Even when attacks are not severe or life-threatening, symptoms
like tiredness and shortness of breath and wheezing can eat away at
quality of life, productivity, and health care dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Asthma is the single biggest cause of missed school days (about
10 million a year), causes half a million hospitalizations, and
costs the economy an estimated $6 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
   This troubling picture is something of a paradox. After all, the
air is cleaner than it was 30 years ago; researchers have gained a
deeper understanding of the asthma process, if not its root cause;
more and better drugs exist to quell symptoms and keep the disease
under control. Yet the epidemic continues.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons not entirely clear, the asthma burden is falling
heaviest on minorities, especially those living in urban poverty.
Blacks and Hispanics have a higher rate of asthma and also get
sicker. Minorities have a threefold greater rate of
hospitalizations, double the rate of emergency room visits, and
``more wheezing days and episodes requiring a parent to miss
work,'' says Dr. Peyton Eggleston, a longtime asthma researcher at
Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, quoting findings from a
federally funded study.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, research on the causes of asthma and factors that
worsen it has been stepped up, and new drugs are being designed to
augment or replace today's medications, which are inconvenient and
have some adverse side effects. The federal government has issued
guidelines on treating asthma aimed at putting the latest research
findings into practice.
</P>
<P>
   And recently, medical and social campaigns aimed at reducing the
toll of the disease have been launched.
</P>
<P>
   In some medical centers, physicians, nurse practitioners, health
educators and mental health workers are all involved in providing
care.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because it's so common, asthma isn't always taken
seriously. And asthmatics, unlike people with many chronic
diseases, don't stand out. ``People don't really understand that
the kids can look so normal and be so sick when they're acutely
ill,'' said Dr. Robert Liscio, a Hollis, N.H., radiologist whose
son Christopher had severe asthma as a youngster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something people can see and hear and touch,'' said
Representative Patrick Kennedy, Democrat of Rhode Island, ``and
there's enormous pressure (on people who have it) to minimize it.''
Kennedy, son of Senator Edward Kennedy, has had severe asthma all
his life. ``This disease is a real terror, because there is so much
psychological impact on kids who grow up with it,'' added Kennedy,
who said it eroded his self-image in a family where playing
competitive sports was a badge of honor.
</P>
<P>
   Asthma is the most common chronic disease of children, and can
be present almost from birth. The term refers to a group of
symptoms involving the respiratory system: wheezing, shortness of
breath, coughing, and tightness of the chest muscles.

SOME LEFT BETTER JOBS, ANSWERED INNER CALL TO TEACH 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Above the blackboard in Penny Pagels' classroom at
Ballard High School is a cutout picture of a brain and an
admonition. ``This is your brain,'' the sign says. ``Use it to your
advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Pagels, a science teacher who formerly did cellular research for
a biotechnology firm, spurs student thinking with a rat-a-tat
speaking style that mixes quips and facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, hands are flying in the air,'' she says after asking how
seeds are dispersed during a biology class discussion on plant
reproduction. When a student delivers the correct answer, she
blurts, ``Thank you, Doctor!''
</P>
<P>
   She's in her element.
</P>
<P>
   As teachers in Washington campaign for higher wages, Pagels
represents the educator who has spurned better pay in private
industry to come to the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Applicants to the University of Washington's masters-in-teaching
program ``could be nurses, lawyers, engineers,'' said Allen Glenn,
dean of the College of Education. ``We've had Nordstrom shoe
salespeople.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their background, they seek more significance in life,
not more bucks in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   About half the UW's teaching applicants are making a career
shift, a percentage that generally has remained steady for five
years, said Nathalie Gehrke, director of teacher education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always stunned to see an applicant with a Ph.d,'' Gehrke
said. ``(Applicants in general) talk about a mission, a legacy,
doing something for other people. They use a language that's much
more spiritual.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Vaughan, associate dean of Washington State University's
College of Education, said the university had 125 applications last
fall for its masters-in-teaching program in Vancouver, Wa., the
highest ever. About three-quarters of those applicants were
changing careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm struck by how many people are saying things like, `I need
to feed my soul,' and I wonder if they know what they're getting
into,'' Vaughan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not idealistic or starry-eyed. They're coming from
jobs where the emphasis is on input and output. It doesn't really
support their need to make a difference with human beings over
time.''
</P>
<P>
   As many as 90 percent of students in Seattle University's
masters-in-teaching program are also shifting careers, said Margit
McGuire, director of teacher education.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are coming from the social service areas,''
McGuire said. ``Maybe they worked in the juvenile delinquency area,
social work, tutoring, some kind of service job. They thought they
could have a greater impact if they could be teachers of these
people'' instead of having them as clients.
</P>
<P>
   Pagels' path to the classroom was through the laboratory, not
social work. After earning a bachelor's degree in marine biology
and zoology from Humboldt State University in Arcata, Calif., in
1986, her peripatetic career included jobs with the National Marine
Fisheries Service, a Japanese fishing company, the Peace Corps, a
marine laboratory in Ireland and Greenpeace in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   After two years at ZymoGenetics, a Seattle biotech firm, she
answered an inner call to the classroom and entered the Seattle
University teaching program. She is in her second year at Ballard
High.
</P>
<P>
   It was during Pagels' Greenpeace stint, when she often spoke at
schools, that she first seriously considered teaching, she said.
Instead of banging heads with a ``not-so-friendly audience'' of
legislators, she thought she could make a difference by winning
over a younger generation.
</P>
<P>
   Her Greenpeace job paid $33,000 a year, about $6,000 more than
she currently earns, even though she now has a master's degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do it (teaching) for money,'' she said. ``It's so
important to me. I wanted to give something back to society instead
of complaining how society is deteriorating.''
</P>
<P>
   Teaching was ``definitely the right choice,'' said Pagels, 34,
who started a new class in genetics at Ballard High and also
teaches biology and biotechnology. ``Every day is different. I get
to have a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   So do her students, thanks to plenty of hands-on, inquiry-based
projects. In a recent biology assignment, students were asked to
develop a fertilizer product, including compiling a list of organic
or inorganic elements, making a ``recipe'' and creating a sales
pitch, all on a mock $10,000 budget.
</P>
<P>
   During their presentations, teams of students hawked their
products, with some saying their specialized mixtures ``turn the
competition green with envy.''
</P>
<P>
   Pagels, who regularly addresses her students with a booming
``Ladies and Gentlemen!'', has ``got fun ways of doing stuff,''
said freshman Aaron Bond. He calls biology one of his two favorite
classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knows what she's talking about from experience,'' agreed
sophomore Lily Hereford.
</P>
<P>
   For teacher Scott McMahon at Bellevue's Sammamish High School,
history did nothing for him as a teenager.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not just because of the way it was taught; it was
because I was 17 years old,'' said McMahon, 38. ``I did not have
the life experience to relate to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he does. McMahon came to teaching from Microsoft, where he
was a technical writer for five years. Before that, he was a
sportswriter, copy editor and page designer for newspapers in
Washington and New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft is a fascinating place to work, but you can go
literally weeks at a time without (extensive) people contact,''
McMahon said. ``Since the projects are so long, I just needed
something where I could see the results on a day-by-day basis and
work with real people.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he teaches about 140 students per day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having kids of my own probably gave me a focus for doing
something for the next generation,'' said McMahon, whose children
are 7 and 4.
</P>
<P>
   As for compensation, ``there's no question I made more money at
Microsoft,'' he said, though he doesn't say how much. ``I wouldn't
overplay it. ... If I was living month-to-month, I probably would
not have gone this route.''
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Pittenger, who graduated with McMahon last year in the
UW's masters-in-teaching program, earlier worked as a dietician and
in food service administration for Boeing and for Riverside
Hospital in California.
</P>
<P>
   During the years she took time off from her career to raise two
daughters, now 19 and 13, Pittenger pondered a return to the work
force.
</P>
<P>
   At cocktail parties, ``you were measured by what your job was,''
she said. ``If I said I stayed home with children, people literally
stepped away from me, like I had no value.''
</P>
<P>
   Pittenger, who teaches social studies and language arts at
Kentlake High School in Kent, said teaching appeals to her because
``you really are making a difference,'' she said. ``You don't get
that in a lot of other jobs. ... I like the kind of rewards you get
in education. It's not putting a Band-Aid on the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Monetary rewards are another matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hope you're compensated enough so you're not eligible for
food stamps,'' said Pittenger, who is in her 40s and whose husband
is a manager and engineer at Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be difficult to be a teacher if my husband didn't
have a good job. We all knew up front the reward was not going to
be financial. We're not blind about that.''

BANDS FIND NICHE MIMICKING REAL ACTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TERESA TALERICO  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Tyler
Lindsley and his band pay a whopping compliment to The Cars.
</P>
<P>
   They pay tribute, really, by donning skinny ties and
checkerboard sneakers, dubbing themselves the Used Cars and
recreating every last chord of ``Just What I Needed,'' ``My Best
Friend's Girl,'' ``Shake It Up'' and other hits by the 1980s new
wave band.
</P>
<P>
   A Seattle quintet, Used Cars is among hundreds of tribute bands
that have found a niche mastering _ or at least mimicking _ another
group's act.
</P>
<P>
   Call them cheesy. Call them copycats. But fans can't get enough
of these bands, which imitate everyone from Aerosmith to ZZ Top and
have cornered a market thought to be pioneered by the first Elvis
Presley impersonators.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike cover bands, which play music from a variety of
performers, tribute bands devote themselves to a specific artist or
group.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, a city better known for alternative rockers
struggling to perform original music, several tribute bands have
managed to thrive. They include Randy Hansen (Jimi Hendrix),
Whiskey Creek (Lynyrd Skynyrd), Machine Head (Deep Purple), The
Nowhere Men (The Beatles), In Color (Cheap Trick), Bon Scott's Army
(AC/DC), Ham Valen (Van Halen) and The Honky Tonk Revue (Hank
Williams Sr.).
</P>
<P>
   Most, with the exception of internationally famous Hansen,
remain local bar bands. Few can afford to quit their day jobs.
Still, they keep dance floors crowded and live out a fantasy most
music fans only dream about while playing air guitar along with
their stereos.
</P>
<P>
   The Used Cars include a waiter, delivery truck driver and
Lindsley, a self-employed landscape/maintenance worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a big moneymaking venture for us,'' said the
31-year-old drummer/founder. ``We all have regular jobs. This is
kind of more for fun.'' Lindsley was 13 when he discovered The
Cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the first couple of records came out, I was really into
them,'' he said. ``I thought it would be a great idea to put on a
show and play the music I loved so much as a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Clubgoers, in turn, seem to enjoy the tribute bands, essentially
the next best thing to the real McCoy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like seeing a national act,'' says Mark Durbin, a Seattle
promoter who works with tribute bands. ``People like to see that
kind of music. It reminds them of the old school days.''
</P>
<P>
   Some are remarkably good, mastering everything from songs to
style to stage presence. Others make you yearn to hear the real
artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as tribute bands go,'' said Steve Dougan of Machine
Head, ``there are a lot of wannabes, but not that many who have put
it together well.''
</P>
<P>
   At a recent concert at the Tractor Tavern in Seattle's Ballard
neighborhood, the Honky Tonk Revue delivered enough twang and yodel
to make Hank Williams proud.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-piece band, which includes an upright bass, pedal steel
guitar and fiddle, performed ``Your Cheatin' Heart,'' ``Honky
Tonkin'' and other hits by the warbly-throated country legend who
died too young (at 29).
</P>
<P>
   The dance floor never emptied. Guys in jeans and women in cowboy
boots and swirly skirts twirled, two-stepped and did the Western
swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a campy version of the Hank stuff,'' said guitarist
Ron W. Bailey, 51. ``We try to keep it really rooted in the
authentic thing they had going.''
</P>
<P>
   The revue started five years ago, born of musicians that loved
Hank Williams enough to give up their Wednesday nights every winter
to play at the Tractor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just put on one of his records, and after not listening to
him for a long time, I realized how good it was,'' said Bailey, a
video producer by day. ``We said, `Anybody wanna do a tribute to
Hank?' and suddenly we had everyone who could do a Wednesday night,
which is usually an off-night.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Zasky, managing editor for the recently closed Musician
magazine, said he has seen tribute bands make their mark on the
music scene.
</P>
<P>
   Bjorn Again, an ABBA tribute, performs at festivals and venues
bigger than any ABBA ever played. It was a Kiss tribute band that
inspired the original rockers to put their makeup back on.
</P>
<P>
   And the ultimate Cinderella story: The vocalist for the tribute
band British Steel actually went on to replace Judas Priest's lead
singer, Rob Halford, said Zasky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have managed to make it into a really big thing
and make it a worldwide success,'' he said. ``But most of them
don't really get very far.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Hansen has. The 44-year-old Seattle native started his
Jimi Hendrix act in the 1970s as part of a Las Vegas lounge act
called Kid Chrysler and The Cruisers. Today, he tours the world.
His music was featured in the movie ``Apocalypse Now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started doing this, the only tribute acts out there
were the Elvis tributes,'' he said. ``If there had never been that
first Elvis impersonator, I could never see this stuff happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Hansen says it's not just about pretending to be someone else.
It's about tipping your hat (or in his case, Stratocaster) to
someone you admire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never approached it from the standpoint of, `Oh I'm going to
be Jimi Hendrix out there,''' he said. ``That would be like a
trained monkey. I've approached it from, `God, I love this
music.'''

PYM FRIENDS READ BETWEEN THE LINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Beth Klein, a corporate training consultant, said she'd wondered
what sort of people would show up for the first meeting of the
Barbara Pym Society of North America last weekend at Harvard Law
School. ``I thought: Would they look like me?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   By and large, they did. They were the same type at least, women
in their middle years, along with a handful of young and
middle-aged men. During a coffee break a photographer covering the
event for a Montreal newspaper kept snapping images of sensibly
shod feet, presumably to give readers a flavor of the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   It was a gathering of fans exhilarated to find themselves in a
room with fellow Pym readers, eager to talk about her characters as
if they were friends, able to quote favorite lines from memory.
Ellen Miller, director of publications at Havard Law School, who
organized the meeting, had feared a small turnout. She was
gratified when 100 people registered, but disappointed that she had
to turn a dozen more away for lack of space. Most of those
attending were from New England and New York; some traveled from
California, Washington state, Washington D.C., Ottawa, Montreal,
and other relatively far-flung places.
</P>
<P>
   The featured speaker, Dr. Barbara Everett, senior research
fellow at Somerville College, Oxford University, traced Pym's
development as a novelist from her earlier, lighter books to her
later novels, deeper and richer works in which she grappled with
disappointment and death. The latter were written during and after
a yearlong hiatus in the 1960s and 1970s in which publishers
rejected her work. One of the later books, ``Quartet in Autumn,''
was nominated for a Booker Prize in 1977. Pym died in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   It was impossible not to wonder what Pym would have made of the
meeting, but surely she would have been gratified to hear readers
talk among themselves about why they love her novels, about their
warmth, humanity, amiablity and humor, about their capacity to
comfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``My professional life is filled with crime and violence,''
Carole Jenney said over lunch. Jenney is a specialist in child
abuse who teaches at Brown University. ``When I go home I read Pym
and tend my English garden. It keeps me sane.''
</P>
<P>
   The scheduled speakers approached Pym from various angles.
Professor Katherine Ackerly of the University of Wisconsin talked
about the role of mothers in the novels. Brother Gabriel Myers, a
Benedictine monk from Washington, D.C., described a pilgrimage he
and a fellow monk made to Pym-related sites in London, including
some Anglican churches that served as models for churches in her
fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Paul DeAngelis, Pym's American publisher at E. P. Dutton during
the late 1970s and 1980s, talked about their correspondence and
read from some of her letters to him. Kate Charles, chair of the U.
K. Pym society, an American who has lived in England for years,
talked about Pym's influence on her own mystery novels
(``blood-stained Barbara Pym,'' according to one reviewer).
</P>
<P>
   Yolanthe Smit of Hoboken, N.J., delivered a satirical swipe at
academics who overanalyze Pym. A bit later in the program
Christopher Shields of Whitby, Ontario, a PhD candidate at the
University of Edinburgh, read from his thesis, in which he
contends, among other things, that in her student days Pym
established a lifelong pattern of substituting food for sex.
</P>
<P>
   Her fans sometimes talk about ``Pym-ish'' moments or situations,
and here was one, right in the program. ``I'd hate someone to make
judgment about my sex life on the basis of what I ate when I was in
college,'' said one woman, reaching for a reviving cup of tea
following Shields's presentation.

IT'S THE HOTTEST GAME IN TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   STRAFFORD, N.H. _ When a handsome new log-cabin home recently
sprouted on a pine-studded hill overlooking Bow Lake, many
townspeople here thought they had finally solved a tantalizing
riddle: Who collected a massive jackpot in January and managed to
keep it secret?
</P>
<P>
   But neighborhood detectives quickly ruled the home on the hill a
false alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when local builder David Whitcher's springtime crews began
work on four breathtaking waterfront houses, eyebrows arched and
tongues wagged again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems every time I turn around, somebody's asking me if
these people are the ones who won the lottery,'' said Whitcher,
president of one of this small town's largest private employers.
``I just tell them, `Nope. These homes have been planned for quite
a while.' We still don't know who won that jackpot.''
</P>
<P>
   As Massachusetts continues to wonder about the identity of last
week's $197 million Big Game lottery winner, there is another
phantom winner here somewhere, tightly shrouded in legal secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   Three months ago, someone walked into a local general store and
walked out with a winning Powerball ticket valued at $67.1 million.
For days, as the pot sat unclaimed, the mystery surrounding the new
millionaire's identity heightened. And then, 13 days after the
drawing, the money was claimed _ not by the winner, but by a lawyer
saying that his clients, ``longtime New Hampshire residents,''
wished to remain anonymous because they ``highly value the
friendly, informal atmosphere in which they live.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, there's been a hot new game in this small (Pop.
3,000) town: Guess Who's the Millionaire? It's part mystery money
story, part parlor game. And across cups of coffee, outside the
local post office, and at the Isinglass Country Store &AMP; Deli, many
are playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we see who's driving the Bentley, that's when we'll
know,'' said Laura Thorne, a Montana native who came here in the
1940s to teach school and never left. ``Everybody's inquisitive
about it. We'll say who we hope got it. We'll say who we hope
didn't get it. We'll watch to see who's buying property.''
</P>
<P>
   When Steve Wright _ jokingly he insists _ told people that his
fishing buddy hit the jackpot, his friend was swiftly deluged with
200 telephone calls from reporters, friends, acquaintances, and
long-lost relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first rumor was that it was a teacher at the school. That
went around all over the place,'' said Wright, who owns Thorne's
Market in the center of town. ``Then I said it was my buddy. I'll
never do that again. Some people are still convinced he's the
winner _ and he isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like our version of `Waking Ned Devine,' '' said
Bill Cranley, a local homeowner, referring to a recent film
centered on lottery-ticket intrigue in Ireland. ``Nobody knows who
it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the locals have few clues about who won the mid-January
Powerball jackpot. But they're laying odds that one of their
year-round neighbors, or possibly a summertime resident here, has
become suddenly _ and quietly _ rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's coming forward. There's not even a leak,'' said Bill
Ward, who with his wife, Cathy, operates the country store that
sold the winning ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Ward said he doesn't know who the winner is. ``If I sell a
ticket, I sell a ticket. I don't ask to see a birth certificate,''
Ward said. And he said he wouldn't say even if he knew. ``But nine
chances out of 10, it's somebody local'' Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   The winning ticket was purchased on Friday, Jan. 15, a wintry
day when local residents figure only those who live or own property
nearby would be in this off-the-beaten-path town.
</P>
<P>
   The combination was among $29 worth of Powerball numbers sold
that day by Ward, who received a cool $30,000 for selling New
Hampshire's fourth and largest Powerball jackpot, available to
bettors in 20 states and the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Danforth Newcomb, the lawyer who represents the trust that
preserves the veil of anonymity, would say only that the winners
(he refers to them in the plural form) will continue to live much
as they had before their bonanza and that they wish to avoid the
damaging consequences that sometimes accompany unexpected fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have chosen to remain anonymous and are confident that
all residents of New Hampshire who cherish their own privacy and
lifestyles will understand and respect this wish to remain out of
the public eye,'' the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   As lottery fever has swept the country, there have been reports
of broken friendships, suicides, and squandered riches as greed and
poor planning have tarnished that winning feeling of knowing that
your ship has come in.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Buddy Post, a former Pittsburgh carnival worker,
hit the Pennsylvania lottery for $16.2 million in 1988. Within
eight years, he had been convicted of assault, his sixth wife left
him, his brother was convicted of trying to kill him, and his
landlady sued him and won one-third of the jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   Like most residents here, New Hampshire lottery officials say
they have no desire to intrude on the winner's privacy. But they
said the situation does present a bit of a public relations
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number-one thing we strive for daily in New Hampshire is
to keep 100 percent integrity,'' said Maura McCann, a spokeswoman
for the state's lottery. ``And sometimes when winners claim it in
the form of a trust, that may lead to some skepticism with the
lottery. It's more difficult to say that ABC Trust has won $67
million versus John Smith winning $67 million.'
</P>
<P>
   John Smith, or whatever his or her name is, ultimately chose to
receive the winnings in a lump sum of $38,049,787.33 _ an amount
that was reduced by 28 percent, or $10,653,940, for federal income
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Even Judith Bates, co-owner of See-It Surveillance Co., which
sells sleuthing equipment, said she has no idea who the winner is.
But that doesn't stop her from guessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are people in town who do know who it is,''
Bates said. ``We sort of think it's somebody who owns a camp up
here and was here that day to check on it. We do feel that things
will be showing up in town _ a new car, improvements to their home
or camp. I just hope it's somebody who can use it.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is no consensus about the winners' identity, their
decision to shield themselves from the public is widely understood
and respected in this town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's a dream everyone has _ to hit the big one,''
said resident Dave Hewitt. ``It's probably a smart idea to stay
anonymous. People would probably hound the heck out of them. This
is a town that likes to live and let live. People are friendly, but
we don't need to get into your business.''

FAMILY OF YOSEMITE VICTIMS TRIES TO PRESERVE NORMAL LIFE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   EUREKA, Calif. _ Inside their modest, pale-green California
bungalow, the routines of family life for Jens Sund and his three
children go on much as they always have.
</P>
<P>
   The family's two dogs, Reggie, a bichon, and Gigi, a poodle,
clamor for attention. Dirty laundry is piled up at the washing
machine. And 10-year-old Jimmy does tricks with a yo-yo in the
kitchen and begs his dad to let him go to a friend's house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not tonight,'' said Jens Sund, warming his hands with a cup of
tea. ``You had a friend over for the last 24 hours. Me and you are
going to hang out one-on-one. We're going to go out and buy you
some shin guards and black soccer socks.''
</P>
<P>
   Buying gear for Jimmy's upcoming indoor soccer season is part of
Jens Sund's effort to preserve some sense of normalcy for his
family, despite the mid- February slayings of his wife, Carole,
15-year-old daughter Juli, and family friend Silvina Pelosso, 16,
after their visit to Yosemite.
</P>
<P>
   Walking past a hallway lined with framed family photos assembled
by his wife, Jens Sund opened the door to Juli's room, which has
been left mostly untouched since her death. On her bed were two
Eureka High School yearbooks and a recent issue of Cheerleader
magazine. Posters of her favorite recent movies, ``A Bug's Life''
and ``Titanic,'' hung on the walls next to photos she has taken at
her grandparents' ranch. A snowboard she'd barely touched leaned
against the dresser.
</P>
<P>
   Sund said he is trying to use the room to keep it from becoming
a shrine. He and other family members often take naps on her bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not nearly as morbid or weird as you think,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, the family gathers to pay respects to Carole and
Juli Sund. On Saturday afternoon, under a steady rain, the family
held a private memorial service at St. Bernard's Catholic cemetery.
Of the three bodies, only Juli's remains have been released by the
FBI, so the family has put off a formal burial until a later date.
</P>
<P>
   At least 1,000 people, including Sen. Dianne Feinstein, are
expected at a public memorial service Sunday at 2 p.m. at Sacred
Heart Church in Eureka.
</P>
<P>
   The return to day-to-day life has been a struggle, friends said.
Those close to the family describe Carole Sund as a kind of
Supermom who held the family together with her nonstop energy.
</P>
<P>
   Jens Sund has tried to fill the void for his three remaining
children while he copes with the gruesome nature of Carole and
Juli's deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Jens Sund allowed The Examiner into his home last week as he and
his family prepared for the weekend services. Sund hopes media
attention about the case will help the FBI and other law
enforcement officials find the killer or killers.
</P>
<P>
   As the investigation inches forward, Sund is trying to move
beyond details of the crime to focus on his children, Jonah, 14,
Gina, 13, and Jimmy. All three were adopted by the Sunds as babies.
</P>
<P>
   Each morning, he fixes his youngest son a breakfast of bacon and
eggs, while scanning the morning headlines for news in the case. He
has taken time off work as a vice president at his in-laws' real
estate firm to pick the kids up from school, attend their
basketball games and take them shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids need me,'' said Sund, standing in the dining room
before a table covered with pictures of Carole and the children,
which will be used for the Sunday service. ``And I think if I can
help the kids, they can help me.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the children is working with a counselor. Jens Sund also
wants his kids to keep focused on their regular activities.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, he let his two older children go on an American
history trip last week with their seventh- and eighth-grade
classmates to Washington, D.C., that got them back late Friday,
just before the memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carole had planned the trip and paid for it,'' said Carole
Carrington, Carole Sund's mother. ``It was a hard decision. When
something like this happens, it can frighten you and you don't want
your kids to go away across the country. He decided they should go
away on the trip and have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The weeks of stress have taken a toll on Jens Sund. He sleeps
just a few hours a night, which is visible in the dark crescents
under his eyes. He rarely sleeps past 4 a.m. and tries to make the
best of it by going jogging at sunrise on the beach with his dogs.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has given up the few drinks he used to have weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he says he has become obsessed with his workout
machine, the Health Rider. He has lost 13 pounds since his wife and
daughter disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   He said he and his family have gotten a boost from the cards,
poems and teddy bears sent by people from around the country, and
from the kind words of strangers who recognize him from TV. He said
he will continue to do some interviews, including an appearance on
Oprah Winfrey's show to discuss child abuse, but does not want to
become a spokesman for a cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to do this for the rest of my life,'' he said.
``I'm going back to my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends are amazed that Sund has stayed so focused and steady
throughout the ordeal and through countless interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``It blows my mind,'' said David Oehler, a family friend. ``I
can't imagine I'd be handling this anywhere near as well as he has.
He's so methodical. He just takes on one thing right after another.
He's been like that throughout.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been three weeks since the family heard that the red 1999
Pontiac Grand Prix Carole Sund had rented for the trip to Yosemite
had been found charred in remote woods off Highway 108 near Long
Barn, Tuolumne County. DNA tests revealed that the two bodies in
the trunk were Carole Sund and Silvina Pelosso, an exchange student
living with the family.
</P>
<P>
   Juli Sund's body was found the following week 30 miles away near
Moccasin, Tuolumne County.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI believes the trio was either kidnapped or carjacked in
the El Portal area on the night of Feb. 15 or the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   No arrests have been made, but FBI agents and Tuolumne County
sheriff's deputies have been scouring the area, focusing on
residents with criminal records.

 (A special report)  
 UNDATED: ... chest muscles.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some people are only occasionally and mildly affected, while
many others, with moderate to severe asthma, are prone to having
acute attacks when a particularly bad allergy season or a simple
cold causes an exacerbation. Acute attacks can last hours, days or
even weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In people with asthma, the linings of the many-branched air
passageways are supersensitive to irritation: doctors call them
``twitchy.'' Genetic factors no doubt have a lot to do with
asthmatics' over-reactive airway linings, but environmental factors
are also extremely important.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, irritants like smoke and chemicals can send the
airways into spasms, narrowing down or blocking them. Some patients
liken it to trying to breathe through a straw. The person coughs,
wheezes and gasps for air, and often has a tight feeling in the
chest.
</P>
<P>
   Having trouble breathing is terrifying. ``It's like when you
were a kid and somebody pushed you underwater and you get
panicky,'' said Yvonne Joyner, a longtime asthma sufferer in
Dorchester.
</P>
<P>
   Allergies to pollens and other substances are a very common
trigger for asthma attacks. Not all people with asthma are
allergic, but most are, and a child who shows evidence of atopy _
meaning predisposed to react to many allergens _ is more likely to
develop asthma than others.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the muscle spasms, inflammation of the airways
causes the tubes to become swollen and plugged with mucus
secretions.
</P>
<P>
   It's now known that this inflammation is chronic: even when
someone isn't having an attack, cells from the body's immune system
are mistakenly swarming to the airways and causing potentially
permanent damage.
</P>
<P>
   Emotional stress can worsen asthma, but isn't the cause of it.
For most people, allergies are at the root of the airway's
overreactions. Common allergic triggers are tree or grass pollen,
animal dander, dust mites, cockroach droppings, and molds.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to allergens, asthma is often triggered by irritants
that include smoke, scents, cold dry air and colds or other
respiratory infections. As the asthma problem widens, there's a
greater recognition of how many people are bothered by things in
the environment that have no effect on most people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have patients who can't even walk down the soap aisle at
the supermarket'' without a bad reaction, said Kathleen Heitmiller,
a nurse practitioner at the Partners Asthma Center at Brigham and
Women's Hospital in Boston, who spends a lot of time helping
patients figure out what things set off their asthma and how to
avoid them.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic upsurge in asthma has occurred mainly in
industrialized countries, casting suspicion on one or more features
of Westernized lifestyles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been speculation about poor air quality and the
environment, but nothing has been convincingly put forward that
explains this large an increase,'' said Redlener of Montefiore
Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Suspects under investigation include specific forms of air
pollution, foul air inside ``sick buildings,'' diet, lack of
exercise, and obesity. One intriguing theory is that children have
less exposure to the infectious diseases of years past, so that the
body's immune system is more prone to overreacting when it
encounters essentially harmless substances like pollen or animal
dander.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best places to see the impact of the asthma is in a
school. School nurses now often say that dispensing asthma
medications is the biggest part of their job.
</P>
<P>
   At the Mattahunt Elementary School in Boston's Mattapan section,
dozens of kids line up before lunch every day outside the office of
nurse Marty Murphy. She lets them in five at a time to use inhalers
or nebulizer machines (``nebs,'' as the kids refer to them) that
administer the drugs via a face mask.
</P>
<P>
   Nurse Murphy opens the doors to a cupboard that's filled with
children's prescribed asthma medications and inhalers: many more
inhalers and nebulizer masks have overflowed into a set of
cardboard boxes on counters and tables.
</P>
<P>
   ``My God,'' said Murphy of the increase since she came to the
school in 1990. ``I used to give three or four treatments a day _
now it's more like 60 or 70.'' She said that all the teachers have
had to become familiar with asthma symptoms because so many kids
have the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs and inhalers aren't simple to use, and if the children
don't follow directions precisely, they won't get enough medicine
into their lungs. The nurses have to show them over and over again.
Kids also have to learn to use ``peak flow meters'' _ handheld
devices calibrated to the patient's lung capacity. If used every
day, the meter can detect early signs of constricted breathing, so
that a change in medicine dosing can avert an attack.
</P>
<P>
   At the Tobin School in Boston's Roxbury section, nurse Sally
Logan said a survey showed that about 20 percent of students there
have the disease. A decade ago, it was only 11 percent, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Health workers worry that the schools themselves are
contributing to the problem. ``A lot of schools haven't gotten rid
of things like furred animals, chalk that makes dust, and scented
markers,'' said Heitmiller, the nurse practitioner at the Partners
Asthma Center at Brigham and Women's. Buildings in disrepair don't
help: at Mattahunt School, a teacher pointed to drooping, soggy
ceiling tile where water has leaked in over many years, potentially
nurturing mold that often triggers asthma symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Such concerns prompted a survey of school conditions by the
Massachusetts Department of Public Health last year, said Suzanne
Condon, head of environmental health assessment for the state.
Seventy percent of schools surveyed reported indoor air quality
problems. The sources of trouble, Condon said, ranged from blocked
ventilating ducts to mold to exhaust fumes from cars outside. Now
the state and the schools are working together to remedy these
potential asthma-provoking conditions, Condon said.
</P>
<P>
   The schools represent a microcosm of the asthma problem: their
efforts to improve the environment for the benefit of asthmatics
are based on anecdotes and educated guesses as much as they are on
solid evidence about what's at the root of the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Likely, it will turn out that asthma has many interacting
causes. And this confronts medicine ``with a very interesting
challenge _ we know we have a big medical problem and we have to
handle it while researchers are looking for the cause,'' said
Redlener.

IN MENTORS WE TRUST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ED SIEGEL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As book and record stores keep morphing from small independents
to Tower Records to Amazon.com, one would think that our range of
interests would grow exponentially. Yet it seems that the opposite
happens _ as choice grows, we tend to retreat into what we know
already. Mass marketing means narrowing of interests _ just look at
the radio dial to see how even one idiom, rock music, has become so
boringly segmented.
</P>
<P>
   How do you break out of the rut and expand your consciousness of
the contemporary arts scene? One way is to find a guru _ literally,
a guide _ who can make sense of all the choices out there by either
putting things in perspective or who, simply by force of
personality, can lead readers or listeners somewhere they might not
otherwise go. Oprah's Book Club serves that function for her
viewers; here are some others.
</P>
<P>
   --Christopher Lydon and ``The Connection'' _ Whether the subject
is Walt Whitman or Norman Mailer, Frank Sinatra or Gustav Mahler,
by the time Lydon and his guests are done dissecting, you want to
read all their books, hear all their music, or see all their
movies. The quality and quantity of the research is phenomenal, but
it's Lydon's curiosity and intelligence that keep ``The
Connection'' fully engaged and engaging. Although I haven't been a
fan of syndicating the show, it has done a laudable job of
promoting local people and stories as national topics. And let's
not forget that the best electronic site for sorting out what's
happening in Yugoslavia has been ``The Connection.''
</P>
<P>
   --Charlie Rose _ Rose isn't nearly as interesting an
interviewer, but as Lydon himself has proved, the art of the TV
interview is different from that of radio. At any rate, the guest
list is usually A-list and if Rose has a tendency to fawn, at least
the likes of Tom Stoppard and Bruce Springsteen are worth it. He's
particularly good at letting writers talk about writing.
</P>
<P>
   --David Byrne _ Can someone be too eclectic? Byrne sometimes
makes you wonder, but whether compiling world music collections for
Luaka Bop, hosting ``Sessions at West 54th'' on public television,
putting together movie soundtracks, appearing on the ``Red, Hot''
CDs or _ best of all _ making records himself, Byrne will introduce
you to everyone from Lyle Lovett to Lucinda Williams, Chocolate
Genius to P J Harvey, the Balanescu Quartet to Cole Porter, Los
Amigos Invisibles to Bloque. His interviews on ``Sessions'' show
that the old dorky persona wasn't an act after all, but so what.
His guests are great and they obviously enjoy speaking with him.
Witness Randy Newman's ``Hey, you've become a talking head.
</P>
<P>
   --Wynton Marsalis's Jazz at Lincoln Center and Herbie Hancock _
If you're looking for a primer on the great jazz musicians of the
century, from Louis Armstrong to Miles Davis, start with Marsalis's
three fine CDs with the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra on Columbia
(skip ``Blood on the Fields,'' despite the Pulitzer). It's a
limited view of jazz, to be sure, so turn to Herbie Hancock's more
adventurous CDs, which pick up where Marsalis's repertory leaves
off.
</P>
<P>
   --Gidon Kremer _ Pierre Boulez's Deutsche Grammophon CDs make
the best case for the spiky modernists, and David Zinman's Argo and
Sony recordings, particularly those with Yo-Yo Ma, will introduce
you to many of this country's fine contemporary composers, but no
one cuts so convincingly through today's classical scene as Kremer.
(The violinist's recordings of the traditional repertory with
Leonard Bernstein, Nikolaus Harnoncourt, and Martha Argerich aren't
chopped liver, either.) Kremer has drifted from one label to
another but his most CDs are on Teldec, where he has just recorded
one of his finest CDs, ``Le Cinema,'' which includes music from
Charlie Chaplin, Nino Rota, Darius Milhaud, Toru Takemitsu, and
Astor Piazzola. (His three recordings of Piazzola compositions are
also worth checking out.) To unite these sensibilities is as
refreshing an accomplishment as classical music could wish for.
</P>
<P>
   --Stanley Kubrick _ The late filmmaker was one of the greatest
in the history of the medium, primarily for his abilities behind
the camera. Underlining the visual imagery, though, was an
exquisite taste in classical music. Kubrick introduced a whole
generation to the glories of the Strauss boys and Gyorgy Ligeti in
``2001: A Space Odyssey,'' while taking a different slant on Ludwig
Van (via Wendy Carlos) in ``A Clockwork Orange,'' combining
traditional Irish music with Baroque and classical music in ``Barry
Lyndon,'' and awakening the horror in the music of Bela Bartok,
Krzystof Penderecki, and Carlos in ``The Shining.'' The rock score
in ``Full Metal Jacket'' survives less well on its own; let's hope
``Eyes Wide Shut'' is both an earful and eyeful. You could also do
worse than reading Kubrick's literary compadres, particularly
Vladimir Nabokov, Jim Thompson, and Diane Johnson, who wrote the
screenplay of ``The Shining.''
</P>
<P>
   --Salman Rushdie _ Born in India and bred, partly, in England,
Rushdie combines the best of the European tradition and an
outsider's sensibility, not only as a writer but as a critic.
Rushdie's writing, particularly ``Imaginary Homelands,'' is an
eloquent exploration of the (mostly) contemporary literary scene,
one that makes you yearn for the time to read all the writers
represented. His latest book, ``Mirrorwork,'' is a more narrow
compilation of Indian writers.
</P>
<P>
   --Howard Zinn _ Gurus are, of course, teachers and my former BU
teacher still cuts through the media's conventional wisdom with
laserlike sharpness. If I no longer agree with him about everything
_ like the necessity for bombing Iraq _ his abiding humanism and
intelligence can turn around my sometimes all-too-conventional
wisdom _ like the necessity for bombing Yugoslavia. When he turns
his mind to it, he's also a keen critic, as shown in his demolition
of ``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   --George Mansour, the Kendall Cinema _ How often have you walked
into this movie house and said to yourself, ``I want to see
everything that's playing here.'' Most of the reason is Mansour's
fine taste in movies, but Landmark has also done a terrific job in
making the place as comfortable as it is. The Kendall, though, has
become a victim of its success. Saturday nights can be a nightmare,
mostly because of the adjoining, independent garage, where you
might have to wait 15 minutes in the cold in order to get out of
the place.
</P>
<P>
   -- Robert Hurwitz, Nonesuch Records _ It's rare these days for
any but independent labels to have as strong a sensibility as
Nonesuch's. As head of the company, Hurwitz has cornered the market
on minimalist composers (Philip Glass, Steve Reich, John Adams),
but there's a wealth of material elsewhere, including Kremer's
Piazzola CDs, Audra McDonald's debut recording of up-and-coming
musical composers, the Kronos Quartet's 10-CD compilation, ``25
Years,'' and the upcoming Caetono Veloso release.
</P>
<P>
   --``Trainspotting'' _ The two CDs from the movie are an exciting
introduction to some of the best alternative groups like Pulp,
Blur, and the more techno Underworld, along with alternative
godfathers Lou Reed, Iggy Pop, and David Bowie. They restore a
faith in the future of rock that stations like WFNX and WBCN seem
to be doing their damnedest to shatter. (Rent the movie while
you're at it.)
</P>
<P>
   --PBS documentaries _ As Joel Cohen's letter to the editor last
week said, public television seems to be doing its best to kill off
the performing arts in favor of ``Cats'' and ``The Courage to Be
Rich.'' The one exception, aside from ``Sessions,'' is the area of
documentaries, as witnessed by those on Leonard Bernstein and Paul
Robeson on ``American Masters''; the Frank Lloyd Wright portrait by
Ken Burns; and the series on African-American artists by Blackside
productions, the last series under the late Henry Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   --The WHRB Orgies _ You couldn't ask for more of an immersion
than WHRB-FM's (95.3) forays into the life of an artist through the
best available (and sometimes unavailable) recordings. The next
orgy period is in May and includes four days of Charles Mingus
along with a somewhat lesser amount of Mahler, Muddy Waters, and
Mark E. Smith and the Fall.
</P>
<P>
   There are any number of other gurus out there. Ella Fitzgerald
and Frank Sinatra are the ways into the great American songbook,
Volume 1. Will Audra McDonald and Cassandra Wilson be Volume Two?
If you're more intrigued by smooth R&AMP;B/jazz than I am, look no
further than Quincy Jones's recently released ``From Q, With
Love.'' The fun, though, is in finding a guru of one's own. Happy
hunting.

INVESTING A GAIN ON THE SALE OF A HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My mother is 58 years old and is about to realize a $100,000
gain on the sale of her home. She is employed as a waitress, and
her income matches her monthly expenses. She has never invested
before and has no retirement accounts or pension benefits to look
forward to, except Social Security. What do you recommend as an
investment strategy to possibly generate $1,000 a month for her at
age 68?
</P>
<P>
   A.S., Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I'll suggest three strategies, ranging from a very
conservative approach to a middle course, and finally to one which
is riskier, but which is far from gambling and which also offers
the possibility of greater rewards. If your mother were simply to
put $100,000 in a solid mutual fund invested in
government-guaranteed mortgages and then reinvest all distributions
for ten years, she could reasonably expect that she would realize
an average 6.5 percent yield over the course of that decade, which
would take her account to $187,713 after 10 years. If she then
simply took the yield in cash, it would provide her with $1,016 a
month, with no invasion of the principal.
</P>
<P>
   What I have in mind here is a mutual fund invested in Ginnie Mae
securities, which are pools of bonds put together by a
quasi-governmental agency called GNMA and then sold to the public
as securities, carrying a government guarantee of both principal
and interest repayments. Despite these guarantees, these funds are
sensitive to interest rate fluctuations and can rise or fall
sharply when rates change. If you look back over a couple of
decades, the track record seems to be that these funds suffer one
or two bad years a decade, but also that they tend to make up the
lost ground fairly quickly. They make good long-term holdings for
retirees, but terrible holdings for people who might have to (or
might want to) cash out at short notice. Good examples here are the
Fidelity or Vanguard GNMA funds, although many other fund families
offer solid funds in this category. One attraction of such a
portfolio is that your mother would not have to change her
portfolio after she retires, but simply to begin drawing down the
yield.
</P>
<P>
   A slightly riskier approach would be to divide the money into
three segments, with half of it in a GNMA fund and 25 percent each
in a short-term corporate bond fund and in a high-yield (or junk)
bond fund. From such a portfolio, she might expect a yield of about
7 percent, but she should also expect a choppier ride in terms of
market value. Again, such funds can be found in most major mutual
fund families.
</P>
<P>
   Finally _ and this is about as far out on the risk spectrum as
she ought to be willing to go _ would be to mix a 50 percent
position in a GNMA fund with an identical holding in a balanced
fund. Balanced funds divide their holdings between stock and bond
portfolios, and although the potential for gains is considerably
greater because of the stock market exposure, the potential for
losses is also greater. She might hope that such a portfolio might
take her nest egg to $206,103 after a decade, representing average
7.5 percent returns. She could then divert all but about $20,000 of
her portfolio to the GNMA fund, where it would give her the same
income stream as I cited above, and she would have the extra
$20,000 in the balanced fund to give her some prospect of portfolio
growth to help her cope with the effects of inflation in the later
years of her retirement. An excellent fund in the balanced category
is Fidelity Puritan.
</P>
<P>
   Which of these three approaches she might take should rely in
good part on her appetite for risk; if she's the kind of person who
would panic or lose sleep if her savings lost a significant amount
of their value, she should certainly steer clear of the third
option. And remember, the first and most cautious approach would
fulfill the need you stated, so maybe she would feel most
comfortable with that limited risk.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if she is not already contributing to an IRA, she
should begin with the first $2,000 of this money going into an IRA
account, which could be invested in the same manner as the rest of
the portfolio. Each year following, she could move another $2,000
from the taxable account to an IRA. This would reduce her current
tax liabilities, and would be unlikely to cause her very
considerable tax impact in retirement.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am a 73-year-old retiree who will be receiving $47,000 cash
proceeds from a buyout of a company in which I have held stock.
These shares have been generating a quarterly dividend of $525.60,
and I would like to replace this income or perhaps exceed it if
possible, but at my age I need safety of principal and an income
stream I can rely on. I have had bad experiences with several bond
mutual funds in the past, so I don't want much to do with them
again. CDs and Treasury securities, though safe, obviously don't
pay much any more, so I have thought of dividing the money among
purchases of several investment grade bonds or perhaps preferred
shares of solid larger-cap companies which have a long-term history
of paying a good dividend and perhaps even providing some growth to
keep up with inflation. What do you suggest?
</P>
<P>
   C.S., Hampton, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, the dividends you had been getting represented a yield
of only 4.47 percent, so you certainly can replace the income
stream with a good degree of safety. Even a money market mutual
fund would do the job, with the current rates for the better funds
in the range of 4.5 percent to 4.9 percent. Or you could look to a
five-year CD: Entering this week, the nation's average rate for CDs
under $100,000 was 4.61 percent, and the best rate offered
nationally was 5.90 percent. This would bump your quarterly income
stream from that $525.60 to a little more than $693, which is a
tidy advance. I won't bother to give you the institution with the
highest rate, because it will be out of date by the time you read
this, but check the Data Bank page in the Sunday editions of The
New York Times business section and it will provide the figures and
identify the institutions with the best rates.
</P>
<P>
   As for individual corporate bonds, you would certainly get
better rates, but you would also assume both credit risk and
interest-rate risk _ the risks, respectively, that the company
would default on the bonds, and that interest rates would rise,
rendering the current value of your holdings lower. With
preferreds, you would get a considerably higher yield while facing
the same kind of risks as with bonds, plus a little extra since
bonds take preference to preferreds if the company gets in serious
trouble. And you would have no serious potential for increase in
your principal unless you went with a convertible preferred issue
with terms, which are likely to make its conversion attractive in a
relatively short period of time. But in that instance, the issue is
likely to trade in a pattern that more closely relates to the stock
market than the bond market, so the risk becomes greater still.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to me that if increasing your income stream from what
you got with your old stock, plus safety, are your primary goals,
you can achieve both by shopping very carefully for a CD.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 77 years old and invest primarily for income. Recently I
put some money in Vanguard Intermediate-Term Corporate Bond fund.
Since then, the shares have constantly decreased in value. What
should I do? The distributions are being reinvested.
</P>
<P>
   B.R., Beaumont, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A. Patience is a virtue. This fund lost 0.7 percent in the first
quarter, more or less in line with the 0.6 percent loss for the
median intermediate-term corporate bond fund. Over a year, the fund
showed a 5.5 percent total return, precisely matching the median
results for the category. Over five years, its 7.7 percent average
annual total return compares favorably to the 7.0 percent median
results. Put simply, you shouldn't worry if the results for a bond
fund are poor for such a brief period, particularly when they are
pretty much in step with those of its peer funds. So I suggest you
hang in there, expecting that the worm will turn. Moreover, the
results for the fund have improved markedly since you wrote, and at
least the fund is within a whisker of a break-even for the year _
off by three basis points as this is written. Morningstar rates the
fund average, and year-to-date its performance is a bit better than
the average for its peers.

MOTHER OF CHALLENGER VICTIM REMAINS SUPPORTER OF SPACE PROGRAM

<P>
   TROY, N.Y. _ Despite the death of her daughter Christa McAuliffe
in the 1986 Challenger explosion, Grace Corrigan remains a
supporter of space exploration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is necessary to do all the exploring they can do,''
Corrigan said during a speech Friday at Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute, which is celebrating Space Week. ``I think it is
important for the International Space Station to go on. Space is
our future and your future.''
</P>
<P>
   Christa McAuliffe was chosen from 11,500 applicants to be the
first civilian passenger in space. President Ronald Reagan had
wanted a teacher to be the first citizen to ride aboard the Space
Shuttle, saying teachers could best communicate the wonders of
space in ordinary language.
</P>
<P>
   Corrigan discussed the impact her daughter's life has had on
others. She told the audience she hoped they would find ``Christa
was a worthy forerunner of yours, with something to teach, the most
important lesson: How to live well.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her daughter's decision to become a teacher was
unintentional, though Corrigan herself was a teacher. At a time
when women's career options seemed limited, McAuliffe thought
teaching her best choice.
</P>
<P>
   After initially struggling, Corrigan said, her daughter
discovered joy in teaching history. She started a course at Concord
High School in New Hampshire on American Women, hoping to give her
female students role models by using diaries of ordinary women.
</P>
<P>
   ``She emphasized the struggle on the homefront as well as the
battlefield were part of history,'' Corrigan said.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe's own brush with history began on Feb. 1, 1985 _ the
last day applications could be mailed to the Teacher in Space
program.
</P>
<P>
   In answering a question on why she wanted to fly into space,
McAuliffe wrote: ``I remember the excitement in my house when the
first satellites were launched. My parents were amazed, and I was
caught up in that wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   She recalled driving on a dark, rainy night and hearing men had
landed on the moon, and she remembered wondering why only men were
there. When Sally Ride began to train as an astronaut, she wrote,
she could see the horizons expand for her female students. Little
did she know she was to be chosen as a similar role model.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here she was a history teacher, and she was going to make
history,'' Corrigan said. ``Because Christa was not an astronaut _
she was somebody's teacher, somebody's neighbor, somebody's friend
_ then we could go there too.''
</P>
<P>
   While some skeptics in the media assumed McAuliffe was looking
to capitalize on her space journey to change careers, Corrigan said
her daughter always planned to return to Concord High.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe also had an independent streak, rejecting NASA's
insistence that the 20-minute lessons she was to give each day be
carefully scripted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christa wanted to do it her way,'' Corrigan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This dream did not die 73 seconds after liftoff,'' she said.
``She has given credibility to the idea that teachers are people
who make things happen. She gave her fellow professionals new
dignity and new honor.'' Today, there are 34 schools in the United
States named after her daughter _ and others in places like Peru
and Mexico. Scholarships are given out in her name to encourage
young people to become teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did Christa touch the heart of the nation? I hope so. And did
she inspire others? I hope so too,'' Corrigan said. ``I hope
Christa's spirit will inspire you in some small way too.''

ACCOUNTING HORRORS AWAIT SOME INVESTORS AT TAX DEADLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like a lot of people these days, William Brennan dived head
first into the stock market. The Harvard MBA student now has a
broker at Goldman Sachs, a family member who trades on his behalf,
and an on-line account, which he uses to buy and sell shares over
the Internet. In his quest for gold in the bull market, he's
conducted at least one transaction a day for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   The payoff has been good, he says. His sizable portfolio has
become even more sizable in recent months, increasing nearly 40
percent since August. But he also got something a little less
desired: A record-keeping nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never ends,'' he says. ``It seems like every time I get
everything sorted out and ready that I've got to turn around and do
it all over again. It's very burdensome, all the paperwork.''
</P>
<P>
   With tax day looming, more and more do-it-yourself investors _
including legions of new on-line investors known as ``hyperactive
traders'' because they buy and sell so frequently _ are confronting
an accounting horror.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't even realize they have to keep track of
every single transaction,'' says Lewis Weinstein, founder and
president of TaxLogic, an on-line accounting service in Needham,
Mass. that has attracted Internet traders. ``If you didn't keep
track of everything you bought and sold, there could be a
significant difference in your tax liability.''
</P>
<P>
   Trouble arises for frequent investors because gains on stocks
held 12 months or less are taxed at the same rate as ordinary
income, which ranges from 15 percent to 39.6 percent. That's
typically a bigger tax hit than the maximum long-term capital-gains
rate of just 20 percent, says Shamus McBride, an accountant at
Arthur Andersen's private client services group in Boston. That
means some trades may be taxed at different rates than others.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters even more difficult, the 1099 forms brokerage
firms send investors and the Internal Revenue Service to report
interest, dividends, and trading revenue generally contain only
data on the sale of a stock, not the specific stock purchase prices
needed to figure the gain or loss on each trade, McBride says.
</P>
<P>
   Without records of each stock purchase and the corresponding
sales, investors could be taxed only on the gains made through
sales while not having the benefit of deducting the costs of buying
the stock in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you buy 50 shares of stock in the morning at $100
apiece. Later, when the stock has gone up to $120, you buy 50 more
shares. Then you sell 75 of the shares when the stock has is going
for $200. What's your taxable gain?
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to match those lots all together,'' McBride says.
``Your tax bill can change a great deal depending on how you do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the larger on-line brokerages, such as E(asterisk)Trade
Group and Charles Schwab Corp., can automatically feed investors'
trading records into their home computers with personal accounting
software like Intuit's Quicken and Microsoft Corp.'s Money.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for that, I'd be lost,'' says Brennan, the MBA
student, who said he downloads his Charles Schwab records with
Quicken. ``I don't have to enter any of the data. At the end of the
month, it's a dream. If I had to do it the traditional way, it
would be a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Brennan says he still has to devote at least half an
hour each day to bookkeeping in order to keep pace with investments
made through his Goldman Sachs broker and the family member who
invests on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm out of town for a few days, I fall way behind,'' he
says. ``I know that if I don't keep up, I'm going to pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Quicken added the stock data function about a year ago,
sales of the popular personal finance program have soared, said
Kevin Reeth, a product manager at Intuit, the Mountain View,
Calif., company that makes Quicken.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's now one of the most popular features,'' he says. ``It
goes right to the heart of why people are buying this program. For
most people, there's too much to keep track of by hand. With the
program, everything you need, including commissions, is taken into
account, and you just print it out on a capital gains report.''
</P>
<P>
   This year _ as the volume of stock trades ballooned to record
levels, especially among investors buying and selling at home with
personal computers _ investors have flocked to accountants seeking
help.
</P>
<P>
   At Weinstein's TaxLogic, business has more than doubled to more
than 1,000 clients nationwide, in some measure because on-line
investors spotted his Web site on the Internet, Weinstein said. His
customers submit their financial data to TaxLogic accountants via
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   While some have come to him well prepared, many haven't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get people who've been trading all year long without keeping
good records,'' he says. ``They'll tell me they have it all in a
statement, and I say, `Are you sure?' Often, they only have a
record of the sales.''
</P>
<P>
   In the cases where clients have detailed records _ either those
they've kept themselves or a statement that records all a
customer's transactions _ ``it makes my life and theirs very much
easier,'' he says.

A STUDY IN SCARLET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GAIL CALDWELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most conventions of popular fiction play to our fantasies while
sheltering our unconscious assumptions: The courtroom thriller uses
a mahogany-trimmed sanctuary in which to unearth its ghastly
crimes; the contemporary romance novel, nodding to the realities of
broken families and transient love, nonetheless promises an inner
life, or at least a willing heart. The domestic drama, steeped as
it is in the comforts and confines of home, particularly relies
upon this covenant of wishful desire and grimmer truth _ insisting
that the hearth be warm and made of brick, even if it's being
smashed to smithereens.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Hanff Korelitz's yeasty drama has elements of each of these
genres, and it follows a recent spate of similar novels, among them
Jacquelyn Mitchard's ``The Deep End of the Ocean,'' Jane Hamilton's
``The Home at the End of the World,'' and Sue Miller's ``While I
Was Gone.'' What these works share is not just dark trouble wrapped
within the cloak of friends and family, but the narrative
perspective of an introspective female character. This viewpoint
bestows the story with a close-focus intimacy that can be both
revealing and claustrophobic. If we've witnessed by the end of the
novel the unraveling of a web of secrets, we also know how
everybody takes his or her coffee and, heaven help us, why.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, ``The Sabbathday River'' has received advance
notice as a ``feminine thriller,'' which is a terrible thing to
call a book, but will no doubt become the shorthand term to promote
it. The novel is actually a morality tale set in the twilight
ambience of small-town New Hampshire, with an adulterous young
woman named Heather Pratt at its center. Much like Hawthorne's
sacrificial Hester Prynne, Korelitz's character becomes a scapegoat
for the rages and fears of a tight-lipped (and tightly wrapped)
community. Most of the thematic parallels to ``The Scarlet Letter''
end there, though Heather's libidinous downfall is at the hands of
a sleazeball with a ponytail named Ashley Deacon. Not even Arthur
Dimmesdale, he.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sabbathday River'' opens in 1985 with the horrid discovery
of a dead infant outside Goddard, N.H., near the jogging path where
Naomi Roth runs. A 35-year-old transplanted New Yorker who has made
a grudging peace with Goddard in her nine years there, Naomi is the
alienated conscience of the novel _ the Jewish outsider whose
hilltop point of view delivers the intersecting stories of the
entire town. Having come to Goddard as a VISTA volunteer with her
piously radical husband, Naomi is now recently divorced and trying
to make her life work. She runs a local crafts cooperative,
Flourish, formed when she convinced the women of Goddard to market
their wares. In the year since her husband, Daniel, high-tailed it
to a commune in Woodstock, she has sheetrocked their A-frame and
made it a home instead of a political statement. And on that sunny
September morning that will change her life, she has found a baby,
lying like a broken doll in the Sabbathday River.
</P>
<P>
   When Naomi panics and takes the child's body to the sheriff's
office, she's initially treated with suspicion for having removed
the corpse from a crime scene. But within hours, the investigation
_ targeted to include any woman in Goddard considered deviant _
ends at the house of Heather Pratt, a sweet, insecure 20-year-old
who lives with her 14-month-old daughter, Polly. Heather has turned
out to be the embarrassment of the town: Dropping out of Dartmouth
after only a few weeks, she returned to Goddard a couple of years
ago and took up publicly with Ashley Deacon, a married handyman who
lists his virility as one of his many skills. Undaunted by the fact
of his pregnant wife, Heather spent several blissful months
steaming up the rear windows of Ashley's car; her own pregnancy,
with Polly, was blindly joyful, and she couldn't understand, or
didn't care, why the townfolk treated her with such disdain. That
scorn was minor compared with Ashley's inevitable rejection, after
which she retreated to her life with Polly and the samplers she
embroiders for Naomi's craft business.
</P>
<P>
   Or did, until this day of the Sabbathday River discovery, when
Heather is ripped away from her daughter and subjected to a
grueling, probably illegal interrogation. Sick with worry and
fatigue, she confesses _ or admits, at least, that she had a
stillborn baby a few days ago, which in her distress and confusion
she left in a pond at the bottom of her property. So we now have
one alleged murderess and possibly two dead infants, as well as a
zealous prosecutor, a bevy of competing medical experts, and an
entire town on the warpath. Not to mention the potential for
several subplots: Caring for Polly while Heather is in jail, Naomi
has to wrestle with her misplaced maternal longings. Judith
Friedman, another displaced New Yorker whom Naomi has just
befriended, is the new public defender in charge of Heather's case
_ when she's not disappearing into mysterious troubles out of town.
And several locals, from the sanctimonious to the scurrilous, have
their own inscrutable agendas; by the end of the trial, which is
woven through the last half of the novel, all of them will have had
their day in court.
</P>
<P>
   Haunting in its painful rendition of the worst kind of death,
purplish in its swollen recitation of Heather's unbridled
sexuality, ``The Sabbathday River'' continually lurches between
melodrama and the tragedy at its center. It has the riveting
components of a good courtroom drama, enhanced by some finely
etched characters (with his nonchalant narcissism, Ashley is
splendidly awful). But some of the moral points of the novel _ that
sensuality is condemned, even criminalized, for instance _ are
driven home with the delicacy of a nail gun. We are afforded very
few gray areas: Most of the residents of Goddard are conservative,
hypocritical, and Christian; their challengers are Jewish, liberal,
and fast-talking urban. Naomi's briefly reappearing ex-husband,
whose name-dropping leftism does, granted, beg caricature, is
nonetheless no greater than the sum of his own cliches. These
stereotypes obscure their characters rather than illuminating them,
and thereby diminish the complexity of sorrow at the novel's core.
</P>
<P>
   Which is, from beginning to end, the retelling of a very old
story: one about the love between parent and child, the sacrifices
made either against or in the name of God, the quest for faith in
an uncertain world. If these themes are articulated unevenly in
``The Sabbathday River,'' Korelitz has managed to make their final
resolution commendably shadowy. There are no victors at the end of
Heather Pratt's trial by fire, unless wisdom itself gets to take a
bow. There is instead the infinite memory of that bright September
day, when ``all the worst things,'' as Naomi remembers, lie
revealed in morning sun.

DAVID KELLEY: HIS PEN IS MIGHTIER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ In the past decade, no one has left a more
indelible signature on prime time than David E. Kelley, a onetime
Boston attorney turned prodigiously prolific writer-producer.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does Kelley show any signs of reducing a workload that still
makes jaws drop in the TV industry.
</P>
<P>
   With Kelley-created dramas already airing on three networks _
ABC's Emmy-winning ``The Practice,'' Fox's ``Ally McBeal,'' and
CBS's ``Chicago Hope'' _ he is now at work on yet another show,
``Snoops,'' a drama about high-tech detectives that is slated for
ABC this fall. Two weeks ago, ``Ally McBeal'' and ``The Practice''
earned 1998 Peabody Awards for broadcast and cable excellence.
</P>
<P>
   At age 42, Kelley deadpans that he is ``older than most of the
network presidents now.'' Indeed, while he looks more like a
self-effacing English teacher than a TV heavyweight who's married
to actress Michelle Pfeiffer, there's no mistaking Kelley's
gray-eminence standing. Even this season's hottest new
writer-producer, Aaron Sorkin of ``Sports Night,'' says he comes up
short when measured against Kelley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond being one of the best writers in the country, David
Kelley clearly takes some kind of vitamin in the morning that
allows him to do four times as much work as I do,'' sighed Sorkin
during an interview on the set of his show.
</P>
<P>
   ``My show is a half-hour, but he writes two one-hour shows a
week, these two great shows,'' Sorkin added. ``Honestly, how does
he do it?''
</P>
<P>
   Don't ask Camryn Manheim. Even though the actress won an Emmy
last year for speaking his words every week on ``The Practice,''
she has not come close to figuring out Kelley.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, he's like an idiot savant,'' mused Manheim. ``I
don't know if he could do anything else. It's like, can you
understand how someone can drop a box of toothpicks and count how
many there are? You can't. You'll never understand that. Well,
that's like David Kelley.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a bunch of words all over the floor, and before you
know it, there's just a script. He's just phenomenal that way. I
can't figure it out. It hurts my brain when I try and figure out
how he does what he does. I have read a lot of movies-of-the-week,
for possible hiatus work, and a lot of them were legal dramas. But
it's ridiculous to even consider doing another legal drama when you
have David Kelley writing for you every week.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Remaining an enigma &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The man on the receiving end of these accolades is a courteous
but enigmatic figure who clearly does not want his life to be an
open book. Despite his marriage to a famous movie star, Kelley has
tried to draw a curtain of privacy around their lives together, and
his friends do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he learned the virtues of reticence here in New England.
Born in Maine, Kelley attended the Belmont Hill School in Belmont,
then went on to Princeton University, where he was captain of the
hockey team (he still finds time to play hockey once a week).
</P>
<P>
   Upon graduation in 1979, he came back to Boston and earned a law
degree from Boston University Law School in 1983. Kelley began
practicing law in Boston _ an experience that would later find its
way into ``The Practice'' _ but found civil litigation
unsatisfying. More satisfying by far was writing a movie script
about an unconventional young attorney during his spare time.
</P>
<P>
   The script, which eventually became the movie ``From the Hip''
with Judd Nelson, brought Kelley to the attention of Steven Bochco,
executive producer of ``L.A. Law.'' Bochco was looking for lawyers
to bring some real-life legal experience to the show. Kelley
quickly became the show's head writer, and his knack for witty
dialogue and over-the-top storylines (remember Rosalind Shays
stepping into the empty elevator shaft?) spread his renown in
Hollywood. Before long, he got the itch to create his own show, so
he left ``L.A. Law'' to make ``Picket Fences.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry Hamlin, a star of ``L.A. Law'' who left the show in 1991,
says the show wasn't the same without Kelley. ``I left `L.A. Law'
for one reason, and that was because David Kelley was leaving,''
Hamlin said during an interview at a party held by the WB network.
``I said `If you find someone as good as David Kelley, I'll stay.'
They couldn't, because there isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is equally high on Kelley, however. Some critics
have lambasted the perpetually unglued lead character on ``Ally
McBeal'' as an antifeminist throwback, while others have questioned
Kelley's practice of having characters from ``Ally'' show up on
``The Practice'' and vice versa. During the February sweeps, two
dubious plot twists raised eyebrows and hackles: the rekindling of
the played-out Ally-Billy relationship on ``Ally McBeal,'' and the
physical brawl between Lindsey and Elinor on ``The Practice.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
A prolific pen &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the overall quality of Kelley's scripts is remarkable,
especially when one considers the quantity. From his prolific pen
(literally; Kelley writes in longhand) have flowed hundreds of
scripts since he left the practice of law behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Picket Fences,'' which Kelley created in 1992 and for which he
wrote most of the scripts, won two Emmys for outstanding drama. In
1994, with ``Picket Fences'' still running, he created and wrote
the medical drama ``Chicago Hope.'' That meant Kelley was writing a
full season's worth of episodes for two shows simultaneously.
``That was a struggle, doing those two at the same time,'' said
Kelley. ``That was pretty grueling.''
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't stop him from placing himself in the same
situation two years ago, when he created two shows set in Boston,
``Ally McBeal'' and ``The Practice.'' Even though he was also
writing scripts for movies like ``To Gillian on Her 37th
Birthday,'' he promptly set about writing virtually every one of
the scripts for both of his new shows. In a business where writing
half a dozen scripts a year is considered prolific, Kelley was
writing 22 episodes per show per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really hasn't been too difficult,'' insisted Kelley. ``For
whatever reason, writing these two shows works for me. I think it's
because the worlds are so different. If I'm away for two or three
days to write one of them, by the time I come back to the other, it
feels like I've been away longer than I really have.''
</P>
<P>
   His insouciance notwithstanding, Kelley's output leaves other
writers shaking their heads, even Kelley's mentor, Bochco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am in awe of David Kelley, simply in awe of David Kelley,''
Bochco said in an interview here. ``He is an amazing guy. He's
unusually gifted, he has an extraordinary capacity to work, and an
amazing imagination. There will come a time, inevitably, when he
won't want to work the way he is working now. But all of us are
fortunate that there was a time in his life when he is willing and
able to work at this level.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Breech, co-executive producer of ``The Practice,''
describes Kelley's writing style as ``Mozartean,'' saying that the
first drafts of Kelley's scripts are often nearly flawless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always feel like Salieri, in the movie, going through a lot
of sheet music, with absolutely no interlude,'' said Breech. ``He's
just a marvel of talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Notoriously reluctant to surrender control of script-writing, a
tendency that reportedly frustrated staff writers on ``Picket
Fences'' and ``Chicago Hope,'' Kelley says he has started to
delegate more this season. But he still writes a lot of the
``Ally'' and ``Practice'' scripts, taking four or five days to
finish each script. And he admits that he can't refrain from
rewriting even those scripts he assigns, with plot outlines, to
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, I enjoy it,'' he said. ``A lot of writers say `I'm
going to features because I can take my time and not have to answer
to deadlines,' but I prefer the pace of television.''
</P>
<P>
   And television likes Kelley right back. The industry bible, TV
Guide, recently anointed Kelley _ after barely 15 years in the
business _ as one of the 45 figures in television history who
``made a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was very flattering, but you take it with a grain of
salt,'' said Kelley. ``When you have several shows on the air, that
counts for something; you stay in the mind-set. That same poll in
15 years might not include me.''

LEARNING THE LAND OF THE `OLD OLD'

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
ANOTHER COUNTRY 
The Emotional Terrain of Our Elders 
By Mary Pipher 
Riverhead Books, 328 pp, $24.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mary Pipher could be a translator. The Nebraska-based
psychologist and author ventures into communities and then returns
to explain their truths and ways of being to the rest of us in
clear, clean English. Best known for her exploration of adolescence
in ``Reviving Ophelia,'' Pipher now takes on the world of the aging
in ``Another Country.''
</P>
<P>
   In what is basically a solid primer on generational relations,
Pipher explains that the very old are not like the rest of us.
Distinguishing the ``old old'' (primarily those over 80 and the
infirm) from the ``young old'' (active, healthy people who just
happen to be past retirement age), she tackles the world of these
``old old'' as she would a foreign culture, eager to decipher it
for the rest of us back in her homeland of vibrant, independent
adulthood. Even her approach is anthropological, a methodical
working out of the ways, means, and motives of these people at the
end of life, people who inhabit what is for many of us an exotic
world.
</P>
<P>
   In a readable fashion, she charts the differences categorically.
The language of the old, she says, is different from ours, and
their priorities have been abandoned, if not forgotten, by
mainstream society. For the generation now in its 80s, she says,
``depression'' will always be economic, whereas for her and her
readers it is emotional. Feelings, she claims, are best shown by
the old in actions, in gifts of food or labor, while younger people
want to talk about their inner workings and may interpret as
neglect actions that are accompanied by silence. In between her
analyses of these differences, Pipher provides illustrations:
recounting tale after tale in which an old person's values of
stoicism and perserverance are misinterpreted by a younger person
as denial and a younger person's expressivity is seen as rudeness
or weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Other passages lay out the author's process, venture into the
world of disability and lost loves, and finally make suggestions
for younger people looking to ease relations with the ``old old,''
offering a road map through what is clearly treacherous territory.
Through anecdotes and stories from her therapy practice as well as
plain advice, Pipher shows how miscommunications can be avoided and
needs translated. ``Flexibility works best,'' she advises, adding
that ``a well-timed chocolate cake or pot of chicken soup can
soothe many an aching heart. They could in 1904, and they can
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicken soup cannot solve all difficulties, of course, and
Pipher acknowledges the shifting terrain of aging and also the
necessary fluidity of parent-child (or grandparent-grandchild)
roles. She discusses how difficult it can be for aging parents and
adult children to accept these changes _ for a grown daughter, for
example, to tell her incontinent father, ``You've changed a lot of
my diapers. Now it's my turn.'' And in between some truly
heart-rending stories, she outlines ways for such painful
conversations to begin with dignity and love.
</P>
<P>
   This is worthy work and undoubtedly needed. However, in her
plainspoken way, Pipher treads fearfully close to condescension.
Saying ``generally, the old like physical and verbal affection'' is
akin to saying ``generally, living creatures like to eat when they
are hungry.'' Even more troubling are two underlying assumptions
that flavor the book. The first is that its readers (whom she
presumes will be younger people) will have to do all the
translating. This may often be true, but assuming that the very old
are incapable of learning new ways of communicating plays into one
trap about which she repeatedly warns her readers. She is treating
the elderly like children and cutting them off from paths of
learning and intellectual growth.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ``Another Country'' is saturated with a kind of
nostalgia that is odd for a psychologist, a somewhat rose-colored
vision of an era she calls ``pre-psychology.'' Pipher seems to be
aware of this bias and repeatedly states her opposition to it. ``I
don't want to eulogize or romanticize the past,'' she writes.
``Real abuse _ sexual, physical, and psychological _ occurred then
as it does now. Denial can keep serious problems from being
solved.'' However, for each bald assertion, she piles on several
heart-tugging stories that seem to show the older generation's way
as better.
</P>
<P>
   Pipher's work is well documented, and her advice seems sound.
And she is probably right when she points out that we have become
more isolated than previous generations have been from our elders.
But in subtle ways, she is undercutting the progress she herself
has been able to profit by. After all, we are able to acknowledge
such problems because of the ways in which our culture has changed.
``Another Country'' reads as if its author was ashamed of change,
not seeking to heal its abrasions. And readers, if not the author,
should be reminded that these new ways of communicating, including
the breakdown of traditional taboos, are what make possible a book
that might help bridge what has been an inevitable gap.

NORTON LIGHTS UP `HISTORY'; `LIFE' MIXES KAFKA, CAPRA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES: ``American History X'' _ Edward Norton's fiery
performance as a skinhead electrifies this complex, tough-minded
story of racism and fascism. It's rough sledding and not as
perceptive as it should be, but it's worth renting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Franz Kafka's It's a Wonderful Life'' _ This short, which is
joined by three others, won the 1995 Academy Award for best
live-action short subject. It's a marvelous mix of Kafka's literary
paranoia and Capra's unadulterated optimism, and stars Richard E.
Grant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meet Joe Black'' _ This is the movie that may force Anthony
Hopkins into premature retirement. It's such a bloated story it
requires two cassettes. Not even the craze for everything angel _
heck, not even a renewed clamor for Brad Pitt _ could justify this
dumb movie about money and spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries'' _ The Merchant-Ivory
production suffers from the failure to make author James Jones the
main character in this semi-autobiographical work. Other than that,
it's a terrific film about families, both touching and intelligent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beloved'' _ Director Jonathan Demme tries hard to bring an
element of surprise to his adaptation of Toni Morrison's novel. But
it's to no avail. While the performances are fine, including Oprah
Winfrey's in the leading role, the predictability of the tragic
story of slavery undercuts the dramatic impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legalese'' _ James Garner stars in the caustic HBO movie about
lawyers and the media manipulating each other. The engaging plot
and terse performances make this one of the best cable-to-video
movies of the year.

UNIVERSITIES GIVE PEACE STUDIES A CHANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN WECHSLER  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLONIE, N.Y. _ It's not necessary to get arrested while
studying peace. But it helps.
</P>
<P>
   Peace studies, at least on the college level, is not just
talking about the lack of war. It involves challenges like dealing
with the poor or the homeless, or taking a stand for something you
believe in, baring your soul in front of class. Or getting arrested
during a protest.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes students just find out something about themselves they
never knew.
</P>
<P>
   Today, peace studies programs flourish on 250 campuses
nationwide, including Notre Dame, Syracuse and Colgate. There are
another 250 programs worldwide. And as conflicts like Kosovo
continue to rage, there is never a lack of issues to talk about.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the second day of a peace conference at Siena College
in Loudonville, N.Y., topics ranged from managing emotion to
avoiding racial conflict, to using tourism and the Internet to make
peace. More than 200 students and professors came from around the
country to take part in the conference, put on simultaneously by
both the Peace Studies Association and the Consortium on Peace
Research.
</P>
<P>
   Studying peace is by no means a new idea. As an academic
subject, its roots go back to the post-World War II era. But its
modern practitioners earned their olive branches protesting the war
in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a legitimate course of study? Not everyone agrees.
Jonathan Melle, a 23-year-old graduate student who took peace
studies while attending Siena a few years ago, says he's heard all
sorts of disparaging remarks from professors at the University of
Massachusetts, where he's working for a graduate degree in public
administration.
</P>
<P>
   You can't teach peace, a professor told him. ``Some people laugh
at it,'' he said. ``I've taken courses where people call this
basically silly.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who teach peace, there is no line between the
classroom and the real world. For instance, Tony Bing, founder of
the Peace Studies Association, traveled to Iraq in 1990 in an
effort to convince the government to cease the aggression that was
leading it toward the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   While there, Bing, a Quaker who teaches at Earlham College in
Indiana, says he offered himself as a hostage in exchange for other
hostages being held there.
</P>
<P>
   Ned McGlynn, a Siena professor who heads the peace studies
program there, said he'll back up his beliefs with his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're faced with the problem, `Kill or be killed,'
frankly, I'd rather be dead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Students of peace do not need to make such fatalistic
commitments, although one professor said he encouraged his students
to use civil disobedience as a form of protest.Others are
encouraged just to open their minds and face their fears. Student
seminar participants have been to Northern Ireland, the Balkans and
refugee camps in Africa to study or volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   Melle, the graduate student, once did a project on homelessness.
He spent the afternoon at a soup kitchen, but never was able to get
the nerve up to actually talk to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why can't I talk to a homeless person?'' he asked. ``That's a
question I still ask myself.''

world's most dangerous terrorist. But The New York Times, working
in cooperation with the PBS program Frontline, has found him to be
less a commander of terrorists than an inspiration for them.
Enemies and supporters alike say he may not be as globally powerful

</P>
<P>
   FROM THE INTERVIEW:
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the genre,'' Jackson says over lunch at the Four
Seasons Hotel in New York. ``I wanted to be in a `Star Wars' movie.
So the next time I was asked (which director he wished to work
with), I said, `I would love to work with George Lucas.'
</P>
<P>
   `` ... (On the set) some guy would come over to me and he'd open
a case,'' says Jackson, who recalls seeing the original ``Star
Wars'' movie on its opening day in 1977. ``Inside were, like, nine
lightsabers, and he'd say, `Choose yours.' I'd be there
hyperventilating. I'd say, `Oh, I'll take that one.' It was very
cool.''
</P>
<P>
   UP NEXT:
</P>
<P>
   ``STAR WARS FEVER''
</P>
<P>
   (EDS: This feature can be easily localized.)
</P>
<P>
   How are die-hard ``Star Wars'' fans occupying themselves as they
wait for the premiere of ``The Phantom Menace''?
</P>
<P>
   Fernando DeRosa, a 22-year-old college student from Suffern,
N.Y., dresses up as the character Boba Fett and attends sci-fi
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dressing up as Fett, going to conventions, talking to people
about the character and how I made the costume, and posing for
photos with kids really helped me come out of my shell,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The costume, fashioned from assorted pieces of fabric, plastic
and metal, as well as parts purchased online, took two years to
assemble and cost nearly $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Bruner, an electrician from Houston, Texas, toils away on
``Star Wars _ The Living Story,'' an Internet-based saga set six
years before ``Star Wars.'' Brunner's Web page has had 15,000 hits
since its debut in August 1997!

   ``I love the genre,'' Jackson says over lunch at the Four
Seasons Hotel in New York. ``I wanted to be in a `Star Wars' movie.
So the next time I was asked (which director he wished to work
with), I said, `I would love to work with George Lucas.'
</P>
<P>
   `` ... (On the set) some guy would come over to me and he'd open
a case,'' says Jackson, who recalls seeing the original ``Star
Wars'' movie on its opening day in 1977. ``Inside were, like, nine
lightsabers, and he'd say, `Choose yours.' I'd be there
hyperventilating. I'd say, `Oh, I'll take that one.' It was very
cool.''

   ``Dressing up as Fett, going to conventions, talking to people
about the character and how I made the costume, and posing for
photos with kids really helped me come out of my shell,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The costume, fashioned from assorted pieces of fabric, plastic
and metal, as well as parts purchased online, took two years to
assemble and cost nearly $2,000.

   ``I love the genre,'' Jackson says over lunch at the Four
Seasons Hotel in New York. ``I wanted to be in a `Star Wars' movie.
So the next time I was asked (which director he wished to work
with), I said, `I would love to work with George Lucas.'
</P>
<P>
   `` ... (On the set) some guy would come over to me and he'd open
a case,'' says Jackson, who recalls seeing the original ``Star
Wars'' movie on its opening day in 1977. ``Inside were, like, nine
lightsabers, and he'd say, `Choose yours.' I'd be there
hyperventilating. I'd say, `Oh, I'll take that one.' It was very
cool.''

<P>
   ``Dressing up as Fett, going to conventions, talking to people
about the character and how I made the costume, and posing for
photos with kids really helped me come out of my shell,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The costume, fashioned from assorted pieces of fabric, plastic
and metal, as well as parts purchased online, took two years to
assemble and cost nearly $2,000.

   THE CONFLICT IN KOSOVO
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-AID _ WASHINGTON _ With several thousand Kosovar
Albanians homeless and still in the Serbian province of Kosovo, the
United States and NATO allies are struggling with how to get aid to
them. (Montgomery, Cox News Service)
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-REFUGEES _ BLACE, Macedonia _ A week ago it was a
torrent, now the flow of refugees from Kosovo is a trickle.
Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians still in Kosovo have fled
on foot into the rugged mountains to evade Serbian shock troops and
make their way across the border to safety. NATO, which is
considering food-aid drops over
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo, says 400,000 or more displaced residents of Kosovo could
be hiding in remote villages or living rough in the wilderness. A
group of 300 refugees who made their way across the Blace border
crossing Monday recounted alarming experiences of surviving Serb
sieges, only to cope with shortages of food and freezing rain in
the woods. (Holmes, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-CONGRESS _ WASHINGTON _ President Clinton meets with
congressional leaders as Congress decides what to do about the U.S.
role in the Kosovo fighting. Some members are pressing for ground
troops, while others want to pull out. (Malone, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MONITORS _ SKOPJE, Macedonia _ Among the suffering of
Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, the swiftest and most brutal punch by
Serb forces may have been delivered to some of the 1,400 local
employees who had been hired by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe to monitor compliance with the peace accord
there. Of them, only one has been confirmed dead at the hands of
the Serbs, and some have been identified among the refugees that
streamed out of Kosovo to safety. But many more are presumed to
have been tortured or killed or both, said OSCE officials. (Holmes,
Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   BLACKCOLLEGE-REUNION _ Did the Daytona experience provide any
lessons for Atlanta police, government officals, merchants and
residents. (Suggs, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 20.
</P>
<P>
   BURT'S-RANCH _ JUPITER, Fla. _ There's a buyer for actor Burt
Reynolds' ranch near Jupiter, a lawyer for the creditors in his
bankruptcy said Monday. (Kleinberg, Palm Beach Post). WITH MAP.
</P>
<P>
   HILLARY-CLINTON _ BOCA RATON, Fla. _ Hillary Clinton visits Boca
Tuesday to raise money for U.S. Rep. Bob Wexler, perhaps the most
outspoken supporter of the president during his impeachment and
trial. She's stopping at the Jewish Community Center before a
$1,000 a plate dinner at the Boca Raton Hotel &AMP; Club. (Crowley,
Palm Beach Post). 10-12.
</P>
<P>
   INDIANS-CASINOS _ TALLAHASSEE _ Florida Attorney General Bob
Butterworth is expected to file a lawsuit in response to new rules
by the U.S. Interior Department that would allow Seminole and
Miccosukee Indian tribes to open casinos in Florida. (Date, Palm
Beach Post).

Y2K GROUPS FLOURISH AS NEW YEAR APPROACHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN WECHSLER  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENMONT, N.Y. _ Y2K came to church last September.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Pastor Steve Lalor of the Emmanuel Christian Church
was simply talking to his flock about the threat of Year 2000
computer-related problems. Next thing he knew, a dozen members of
the church were holding classes on canning, gardening and drying
food.
</P>
<P>
   Some people are preparing for Y2K by moving to the country and
buying generators and guns. But in the Capital Region and around
the country, many are doing the opposite. In churches, in schools
on campus or in private homes, rather than causing panic, the
threat of trouble on New Year's, 2000, is bringing people together.
</P>
<P>
   Community meetings about Y2K are happening everywhere:
</P>
<P>
   _ Last week, the University at Albany held a two-day Y2K
conference for students, staff and the community.
</P>
<P>
   _ In March, 150 people attended a PTA meeting about Y2K in
Glenmont.
</P>
<P>
   _ A bed and breakfast in New Lebanon is holding a daylong Y2K
discussion for anyone who wants to come.
</P>
<P>
   _ A regional Y2K interest group has seen its members soar from
less than 20 to more than 50, and is now looking for a larger place
to meet.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Lalor's church, which is holding a Y2K day-long
seminar Tuesday, April 20, to talk about generators, stocking up on
food and other issues. The public, of course, is invited.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not living in fear of Y2K,'' said Lalor. ``We're just
saying we need to be ready.'' ``Y2K'' is the name given to the risk
of computer programs failing due to the inability to accept the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Problems have been found in both large computers and tiny
computer chips. Although corporate America is spending tens of
billions of dollars to fix the problem, some believe Y2K issues
could cause power outages, food and gas shortages and possibly even
an economic depression.
</P>
<P>
   Much of America seems to be taking Y2K in stride. And while some
advocates say Y2K's biggest concern is last-minute panic, the
possibility of that seems increasingly remote as the issue is
discussed.
</P>
<P>
   After all, some say, how can people panic when they've known
about something for a year? That's why experts like Peter de Jager,
a computer programmer who was one of the first people to tell the
world about the Y2K issue, recently said Y2K problems won't be
likely since so many people are paying attention to it.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, for all of the doom and gloom, in some ways Y2K is
almost a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really is a community thing,'' said Victor Porlier, a
local author who wrote the book ``Y2K: An Action Plan'' and has
lectured on Y2K here and around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, it is a source of civic renewal,'' he said.
``We're all talking about how hyper-sped our lives are. Here, in
small little ways, you've got people having reason to talk to
neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   From Lalor's point of view, it's the church's role to inform its
parishoners about potential disasters. About half of Emmanuel
Christian Church's 60 members are preparing for Y2K by stocking up
on food or other items, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And about a dozen have attended a series of evening meetings to
talk about simple living (AKA: post Y2K-disaster living). They've
learned how to build a garden, how to can and dry food and how to
make bread from scratch. And they may store some food in the church
itself. Lalor has also been in touch with other churches in an
effort to spread the word.
</P>
<P>
   A few towns away, more than 150 people came to the
Berne-Knox-Westerlo High School on a weekday night to hear author
Porlier speak about Y2K. The question-and-answers lasted longer
than anyone expected.
</P>
<P>
   The presentation was brought about by the local PTA, in
conjunction with the district superintendent, who also attended.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came in skeptical. They left believing,'' said PTA
Co-President Janet Finke, who recommended parents leave their kids
at home so all this talk about Y2K disasters wouldn't scare them.
</P>
<P>
   After Porlier finished, a number of locals gave information on
their own. An insurance expert talked about how few insurance
companies cover Y2K-related problems.
</P>
<P>
   A generator salesman told everyone to buy one now if they wanted
one, because they are selling quick.

   &UR; IN KOSOVO, JUSTICE and the U.N. CHARTER COLLIDE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHAEL J. GLENNON &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The crisis in Kosovo illustrates America's new willingness to do
what it thinks right _ international law notwithstanding. The
horror of ethnic cleansing in the Serbian province was well
publicized. But the U.S.-NATO action in Yugoslavia was not
technically legal under the old U.N. Charter regime.

</P>
<P>
   (1,600 words) As the world's only superpower, America is told
that it must act like ``a great nation,'' which still means
defending freedom around the world. That is a difficult enough task
for any nation. It is even more difficult for America, not only
because of its established Cold War pattern, but also because of
its longstanding tradition of holding aloof from global
partnerships.

</P>
<P>
   (1,300 words) American officials seem peculiarly blind to the
fact that often the more the United States attacks a foreign
leader, the more his popularity soars among countrymen who applaud
him for standing tall against the greatest power on earth. The
demonizing of leaders has so far failed to shorten their tenure in
power, from Fidel Castro (who has survived eight American
presidents) to Slobodan Milosevic to Saddam Hussein.

<P>
   (1,400 words) To report international news, the cost of a
journalistic caravan, including hotels, per diem expenses, car
rentals and local support staff, begins at about $3,000 a day.
Airfare and excess-baggage charges can easily reach $12,000. Then
there are ``extras'' such as satellite fees. New digital
technology, including smaller and lighter cameras and editing
equipment, will eventually reduce costs, but there is no indication
that the networks will use the savings to increase international
coverage.

</P>
<P>
   (1,500 words) There will always be ``trapped'' minorities, no
matter how carefully boundaries are drawn, except in the smallest
or most isolated environments. But when should secession be
supported by the international community? When massive human-rights
violations, approaching the scale of genocide, are being
perpetrated. Or when reasonable demands for minority rights have
been arbitrarily rejected by a central government.

 &UR; By WARREN BASS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (2,000 words) The bloodshed in Kosovo is a symptom of the
approach, in the Dayton Accords of 1995, which strengthened
Slobodan Milosevic. In fact, Dayton plunged Serbia deeper into
ethnic chauvinism, whereby the ``sacred Serb soil'' of Kosovo
matters vastly more to Belgrade than do the Albanians who resided
there. As such, the Kosovo crisis comes as scant surprise.

 &UR; By BARBARA EHRENREICH &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (1,500 words) The male appetite for battle has always been far
less voracious than either biologically inclined theorists of war
or army commanders might like. In traditional societies, warriors
often had to be taunted, intoxicated or ritually ``transformed''
into animal form before battle. Throughout Western history,
individual men have gone to near-suicidal lengths to avoid wars _
cutting off fingers or limbs or risking execution by deserting.

</P>
<P>
   (1,400 words) In the United States and other rich countries, a
pronounced gender gap with regard to foreign policy and national
security issues endures. American women have always been less
supportive than American men of U.S. involvement in war, including
World War II, Korea, Vietnam and the Persian Gulf War. They are
also consistently less supportive of defense spending and the use
of force abroad.

   &UR; INTERNATIONAL REPORTING, BEHIND THE SCENES  &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By GARRICK UTLEY &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (1,400 words) To report international news, the cost of a
journalistic caravan, including hotels, per diem expenses, car
rentals and local support staff, begins at about $3,000 a day.
Airfare and excess-baggage charges can easily reach $12,000. Then
there are ``extras'' such as satellite fees. New digital
technology, including smaller and lighter cameras and editing
equipment, will eventually reduce costs, but there is no indication
that the networks will use the savings to increase international
coverage.

   &UR; WHEN IS IT RIGHT FOR POPULATIONS TO SECEDE? &LR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   (1,500 words) There will always be ``trapped'' minorities, no
matter how carefully boundaries are drawn, except in the smallest
or most isolated environments. But when should secession be
supported by the international community? When massive human-rights
violations, approaching the scale of genocide, are being
perpetrated. Or when reasonable demands for minority rights have
been arbitrarily rejected by a central government.

   &UR; TODAY'S KOSOVO CRISIS IS HARDLY A SURPRISE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By WARREN BASS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (2,000 words) The bloodshed in Kosovo is a symptom of the
approach, in the Dayton Accords of 1995, which strengthened
Slobodan Milosevic. In fact, Dayton plunged Serbia deeper into
ethnic chauvinism, whereby the ``sacred Serb soil'' of Kosovo
matters vastly more to Belgrade than do the Albanians who resided
there. As such, the Kosovo crisis comes as scant surprise.

   &UR; WHO MAKES WAR? MEN HATE IT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By BARBARA EHRENREICH &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (1,500 words) The male appetite for battle has always been far
less voracious than either biologically inclined theorists of war
or army commanders might like. In traditional societies, warriors
often had to be taunted, intoxicated or ritually ``transformed''
into animal form before battle. Throughout Western history,
individual men have gone to near-suicidal lengths to avoid wars _
cutting off fingers or limbs or risking execution by deserting.

   (1,400 words) In the United States and other rich countries, a
pronounced gender gap with regard to foreign policy and national
security issues endures. American women have always been less
supportive than American men of U.S. involvement in war, including
World War II, Korea, Vietnam and the Persian Gulf War. They are
also consistently less supportive of defense spending and the use
of force abroad.

THE MEANING IN KOSOVO OF `PERSIST AND PREVAIL'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The front-page headline of Friday's newspaper said: ``Belgrade
declares war over.''
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade is the capital of Yugoslavia, of course, which makes it
a headline synonym for Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. This
particular headline referred to an official statement issued by
Milosevic's Serbian government _ a statement claiming that peace
had broken out between the Serbs and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Since the warring parties were now ready to live in ``harmony
and cooperation,'' the statement suggested, the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization had no further pretext for attempting to bomb
Yugoslavia back to the Stone Age.
</P>
<P>
   Or words to that effect.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately _ or unfortunately, depending on your point of view
_ the war between Yugoslavia and NATO is not Milosevic's to end. He
certainly has it in his power to declare victory in his campaign of
ethnic cleansing, and if he wants to, he can stop torching villages
in Kosovo. But the only way he can stop the air assault against his
country is to accept NATO's terms; he has demonstrated no
inclination to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's declaration of peace was obviously a propaganda
gambit designed to foster the illusion that he's a reasonable guy
who hasn't done a darn thing to deserve the destruction that NATO
is inflicting. Anyone who takes his declaration seriously is hereby
invited to buy some of those bridges that NATO has been blowing up
in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was having none of it, dismissing Milosevic's
announcement of a unilateral cease-fire as ``not even partial
compliance, but the illusion of partial compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is determined to persist and prevail,'' Clinton vowed.
</P>
<P>
   He keeps saying that. But before the American people can decide
how far they are willing to follow Clinton into the potential
quagmire of Yugoslavia, they need the answer to a crucial question:
What is the president's definition of ``persist and prevail''?
</P>
<P>
   We are talking about a commander in chief, don't forget, who is
capable of disputing what the meaning of ``is'' is. We're talking
about a man who sees a significant distinction between
``misleading'' and ``lying.''
</P>
<P>
   So when he says that the United States and its NATO allies will
``persist and prevail,'' does he mean that the bombing will
continue until all of Yugoslavia is a pile of rubble and Milosevic
is dead or under arrest as a war criminal?
</P>
<P>
   Or does Clinton's definition of ``persist and prevail'' run more
in the direction of achieving some compromise agreement under which
NATO agrees to stop the bombing and Milosevic promises to stop
eradicating Albanians?
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton is leaning toward the latter, his persistence is
somewhat academic, seeing as how Milosevic responded to the bombing
by killing or displacing most of the folks the bombing was supposed
to protect.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about your Pyrrhic victory.
</P>
<P>
   When the airstrikes began last month, the stated objectives were
to stop ethnic cleansing of ethnic Albanians and to force Milosevic
to allow deployment of 28,000 NATO peacekeepers in Kosovo. Lately,
though, Clinton has been saying that NATO's primary objective is to
make sure that exiled residents can return to the ethnically
cleansed region and resume their lives without further threat of
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the objective can be achieved only by the indefinite
occupation of Yugoslavia by foreign soldiers, including Americans.
The plan currently on the table calls for 4,000 U.S. troops to
participate in a post-bombing peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   This military undertaking may be the perfect example of a
lose-lose situation. If Clinton fails to meet his objectives, the
world's lone remaining superpower will have suffered a horrendous
loss of credibility. If he succeeds, the United States will have
won the privilege of establishing a military presence of indefinite
duration in a part of the world where peace has been the exception
and war has been the rule for hundreds of years.
</P>
<P>
   The whole deal is just a terrible idea.
</P>

FORT WORTH LANDMARK TAKES FLIGHT: CALDER'S `EAGLE' SOLD, CARTED
OFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LAURA VOZZELLA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ ``The Eagle'' has flown the coop.
</P>
<P>
   A 40-foot-tall orange steel sculpture by Alexander Calder that
loomed outside a downtown Fort Worth bank tower for a
quarter-century abruptly took flight on Sunday for parts unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas company that bought the sculpture along with the Bank
One tower last fall said it sold the abstract artwork to finance
building improvements _ including the installation of fire
sprinklers, which the 36-story building lacks.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Cherry, president of Dalcan Investments, declined to
disclose the buyer or the purchase price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Transferring the value of that sculpture to the building will
benefit the tenants and ultimately the downtown area,'' Cherry
said.
</P>
<P>
   Horsefeathers, cried a ruffled arts community, which had
persuaded a previous owner to call off a contemplated sale of ``The
Eagle'' in early 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a desecration of the physical environment of Fort
Worth,'' said Ted Pillsbury, former director of the Kimbell Art
Museum, who lives in a downtown loft near the sculpture's former
roost. ``I think this is a terrible blow to all of us who are
committed to the revival of downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   The orange giant had straddled the northwest corner of Fifth and
Throckmorton streets since 1974, when Fort Worth National Bank
opened the building. It was valued at the time at $144,000.
</P>
<P>
   Installed two years before Calder died, the piece is one of his
last important works. Also known for witty mobiles, Calder
reportedly considered ``The Eagle'' to be one of his major
``stabiles,'' a term the Philadelphia native coined for his
nonmoving sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years after its installation, the sculpture was valued at
$1 million to $2 million. Bank One, which owned the tower and the
artwork at the time, considered selling the sculpture, but backed
down after local art lovers cried foul.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, there was no notice of the sale. Building
tenants had been polled about the potential removal, but they were
not notified that it would take place, said Bill Lawrence, a public
relations specialist hired by Dalcan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of floored,'' said Ronald Watson, chairman of the art
department at Texas Christian University, who has been involved in
the field of public art.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence said there was no intention to keep the removal a
secret. It took place on a Sunday, he said, because street and
sidewalk traffic would be at a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's broad daylight,'' Lawrence said. ``It's not like we came
in at midnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Cherry said that Dalcan is sensitive to the city's artistic
interests and that it may install another sculpture on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not our intention to leave that corner vacant,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As curious passers-by looked on, the artwork came down in about
nine hours Sunday. Workers unbolted the 16-ton sculpture to divide
it into six huge parts, the last of which had to be jackhammered
out of the sidewalk. Two cranes hoisted the parts onto a couple of
flatbed trucks, which took the sculpture to an undisclosed location
for restoration, Lawrence said.
</P>
<P>
   Calder was the first 20th-century American sculptor to win
international acclaim. His brightly painted sculptures grace public
plazas in major cities throughout the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Yet plunking one of his orange abstractions in downtown Fort
Worth was considered a bold stroke in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every 100 years or so a bank should do something a little
flamboyant,'' the Fort Worth National Bank chairman, Lewis H. Bond,
said at the dedication.
</P>
<P>
   Flamboyant or not, the sculpture became a landmark in a city
where cowboys and culture rub elbows.
</P>
<P>
   ``For any of those who walk by the John Portman (designed)
building in July, when there's nothing but glare and heat off of
this black building, at least they had the pleasant relief of this
organic shape,'' Pillsbury said. ``It animated an otherwise rather
desolate public space, playing off the minimal design of the
building.''
</P>
<P>
   Karla Sanchez Zapeda, a graduate art history student at TCU who
recently researched Calder, said she has spent hours admiring the
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the sun, it looked really great there and it made a great
contrast with the surface of the building,'' she said. ``Steel vs.
glass.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is sorry to see it go, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought it was terrible, myself,'' said Gavin
Garrett, 80, a rancher raised in Fort Worth. He watched the removal
from across the street with his wife, Bonilee, who considers
herself a bit of a Calder fan and was disappointed to see it
removed.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they liked the sculpture or not, downtown office workers
got a jolt when they took in the landscape on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Sculptures that are part of the public landscape, that people
can walk up to and under, come to be seen as ``more or less in the
public domain,'' said Mark Thistlethwaite, a TCU art history
professor who teaches a seminar on public sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   Often, of course, they are private property.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get reminded of it,'' he said, ``when something like this
happens.''

ANGELINA JOLIE IS `PUSHING' FOR STARDOM 
</HEADLINE>
  Includes a color slide of Angelina Jolie with Billy Bob Thornton in
a scene from ``Pushing Tin.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Even the hottest young actress in Hollywood knows when it's time
to cool off.
 &HT;    After winning a Golden Globe Award for her role in the
television movie ``Gia,'' Angelina Jolie pushed past the press
waiting outside, kicked off her heels and dove into the
Olympic-sized pool at the Beverly Hills Hotel.
 &HT;    Never mind her Randolph Duke dress with its 5,000
antique-crystal beads. Never mind her carefully coifed hairdo or
the Harry Winston baubles that surely weren't meant for moonlight
dips.
 &HT;    ``It surprised me that no one else jumped in the pool with me,''
the 23-year-old Jolie says. ``Here I am, at an event with the
wildest actors in the business, and everyone was so tame and
serious. My question is, `Why wouldn't you want to jump into a
pool?'''
 &HT;    If you think that's unusual, try this: After her award-winning
turn in ``Gia,'' she actually contemplated quitting show business,
just as her agent's phone was starting to ring.
 &HT;    ``I was at a place in my life where I had everything I thought
you should have to make you happy,'' she recalls, ``and I felt
emptier than ever. I thought after `Gia' that I had given
everything I had to offer, and I didn't find myself growing.
 &HT;    ``I didn't have the strength to deal with Hollywood,'' she says
over breakfast at the Ritz Carlton in Pasadena, Calif. The lips
that have been described as being ``the size of sectional sofas''
curve in a frown.
 &HT;    ``I just needed to get away and find myself,'' she concludes.
 &HT;    Finding herself, in this case, meant going back to school for
some film classes.
 &HT;    ``It was at that point I realized how lucky I was to be on a
film set,'' she says. ``I suddenly appreciated my career, and I
started opening up again to Hollywood. I started to feel like the
fans I suddenly had weren't threatening to my life, but through my
work they were letting me in their life.''
 &HT;    A lot more people will be doing that after the April 23 release
of ``Pushing Tin,'' in which Jolie plays the knockout wife of a
macho, risk-taking air-traffic controller (Billy Bob Thornton).
Depressed, she winds up having an affair with another controller
(John Cusack), who happens to be her husband's main rival.
 &HT;    And, yes, going behind the scenes in the frenzied world of
air-traffic control made her a little nervous.
 &HT;    ``I had to keep reminding myself, `You're not going to die on a
plane. There is just no way,'' the actress says. ``In fact, I'm the
one who asks for the exit rows, because I want to be the one who
gets everyone out.
 &HT;    ``I'm not scared of much,'' she adds, ``because I really do live
by the creed that I might die tomorrow. In fact, I'm surprised I'm
still here. Honestly, I'm the kind of person who always could feel
the clock ticking.''
 &HT;    These are troubled times for Jolie, who is recently divorced
from ``Trainspotting'' star Jonny Lee Miller.
 &HT;    ``We're great friends, and I love him to death,'' she says.
``We've been going through this breakup so slowly because we want
each other to have all that we need in life right now.''
 &HT;    Her voice lowers.
 &HT;    ``Right now we need to do things separately, but it's all done
from love,'' she says. ``We're both holding each other's hand
through this, and it's been amazing _ the divorce has actually
brought us closer. I still consider him my husband.''
 &HT;    The other man in her life is, of course, her father,
Oscar-winning actor Jon Voight. In fact, it was in one of his
movies _ ``Looking to Get Out'' (1982) _ that the 6-year-old Jolie
made her screen debut.
 &HT;    ``I don't have many memories,'' she says. ``I basically remember
being in a hotel room with my brother and dancing on the bed
because we were so bored.''
 &HT;    Jolie's mother, actress Marcheline Bertrand, divorced her father
when she was an infant. Jolie lived with her, but spent weekends
with her father.
 &HT;    ``I would stage readings of plays in my living room,'' Voight
recalls in a separate interview. ``I remember, when Angie was 16,
she would stun us with powerful performances.''
 &HT;    Smitten, the young woman trained at the Lee Strasberg Theatre
Institute and then hit Hollywood. Early roles in ``Hackers'' (1995)
and ``Foxfire'' (1996) led to a role as the wife of the title
character in the cable movie ``George Wallace'' (1997). More
recently she was seen in ``Playing By Heart'' (1999), and she also
appeared in the Rolling Stones video, ``Has Anybody Seen My Baby?''
 &HT;    She shakes her head at the memory.
 &HT;    ``I didn't know what the Rolling Stones wanted,'' she says.
``Imagine my surprise when they wanted me to walk down the streets
in basically my underwear.
 &HT;    ``The great thing is that it was New York,'' she adds, ``and no
one cared. People in restaurants were like, `Oh, there goes the
girl from ``Gia'' in her drawers.'''
 &HT;    Next up is ``The Bone Collector,'' in which she plays a cop
teamed with a paraplegic officer (Denzel Washington) in an effort
to solve a string of murders.
 &HT;    She's currently filming ``Girl Interrupted,'' set in a 1960s
women's mental institution and co-starring Winona Ryder.
 &HT;    ``I've actually spent the last week strapped to a bed, which ...
'' Jolie begins, then laughs. ``There is something so strange and
kinky to all this stuff. And awful _ I spent a week in solitary
with a straitjacket on, too.
 &HT;    ``I have to make light of this film, because it's pretty heavy
stuff,'' she says more seriously. ``It's set in the '60s, when
girls were sent to a mental hospital because they were gay. Women
got shock treatments and they didn't remember their family a week
later.''
 &HT;    As her three high-profile roles suggest, Jolie is in the process
of moving from the ``promising'' category to the ``star'' category.
It's a process that she admits she still can't quite comprehend.
 &HT;    ``It's so weird,'' she says. ``Let's take `The Bone Collector.'
I've seen the poster, which is me with a gun and a walkie-talkie.
In my mind, I look like I'm 5, playing dress-up.''
 &HT;    Less easy to accept is the media attention that comes with
stardom. She and her father posed for a portrait in a recent issue
of Vanity Fair, which Jolie is seeing for the first time. She flips
to the picture, and then scowls.
 &HT;    ``Oh, this is hysterical,'' she says tightly, reading the
caption aloud with an edge to her voice. ```Angelina, a bad girl,
wears death tattoos and rubber clothes and likes to play with
knives. Some of this seems to have rubbed off on her old man.'''
 &HT;    Jolie fumes.
 &HT;    ``OK,'' she says grimly, ``I think I need to make some phone
calls when this interview is over.''
 &HT;    A few sips of orange juice later, she calms down.
 &HT;    ``I don't really take any of this stuff seriously,'' she says.
``I mean, how hot can I be? I'm really this goofy little odd
person, and someday the rest of the world will discover it. They'll
find out that the girl in those evening dresses is really a
complete idiot who spills coffee on herself and broke the phone by
falling over it this morning.
 &HT;    ``I'm one of the flawed people,'' she concludes. ``I just hide
it well.''

EXISTENZIALIST: JENNIFER JASON LEIGH TAKES ANOTHER WALK ON THE WILD
SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  Includes a color slide of Jennifer Jason Leigh with Jude Law in a
scene from ``Existenz.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Jennifer Jason Leigh has spent the last decade or two playing
square pegs in round holes.
 &HT;    Her latest film, ``Existenz,'' casts her as another misfit, a
superstar virtual-reality-game designer on the lam after an
assassination attempt. It's not hard to see in the awkward,
antisocial Allegra Geller something of Leigh herself, a private and
enigmatic actress who has been called a reluctant star.
 &HT;    The comparisons are not lost on Leigh.
 &HT;    ``I liked seeing a bit of myself in Allegra,'' she says. ``I
liked the idea of playing someone who's very shy and uncomfortable
with people _ I certainly understood that.
 &HT;    ``Allegra is really, really uncomfortable with people,'' Leigh
adds. ```The hell with people' is her motto. It's something I've
sort of said for years, too, but Allegra practically wears it.
 &HT;    ``It's almost pathological how shy she is,'' she says, ``which
is partly because of the work she does. She doesn't have to deal
with people. It's only in the game-testing phase that she has to
face the press, and it's very painful for her.
 &HT;    ``And you know what? It is for me, too. I'm not comfortable. I
love to work, but I don't like to talk about my work or myself that
much, and it doesn't come easy to me.''
 &HT;    Leigh, the 37-year-old daughter of writer/producer Barbara
Turner and the late actor Vic Morrow, laughs.
 &HT;    ``I'm not quite as shy as Allegra,'' she says, ``but I'm
close.''
 &HT;    Written and directed by David Cronenberg, ``Existenz'' _ or, as
the promotions would have it, ``eXistenZ'' _ opens on April 23.
It's a futuristic drama that finds Geller in hiding, accompanied
only by unarmed security guard Ted Pikul (Jude Law), as she tries
to sort out the complications of her new game, eXistenZ, which
thrusts them _ and moviegoers _ into a bizarre universe that blurs
the lines between fantasy and reality.
 &HT;    ``For me, the film is about the desire to escape,'' Leigh says
by telephone from her home in Los Angeles. ``It's very funny and
it's also an existential film, in that you create your reality
moment by moment.
 &HT;    ``I love that the film works on so many levels,'' she says.
``Even playing the scenes, from take to take, there were different
choices to make all the time.
 &HT;    ``It was challenging and exciting to keep track of the levels,
but I wouldn't say it was hard,'' she concludes. ``Jude and I would
just look at each other and say, `Let's do it this way or that
way.'''
 &HT;    Working with Cronenberg was a unique experience, the actress
says.
 &HT;    ``We weren't allowed to change the dialogue, but we could
interpret it any old way,'' she says. ``He enjoys that. David is
lovely to work with, incredibly intelligent, very easygoing and
funny.''
 &HT;    Actors who work with Cronenberg tend to come away saying that
it's hard to believe that so normal a guy could have directed such
out-there brainbenders as ``Scanners'' (1981), ``Videodrome''
(1982), ``Dead Ringers'' (1988) and ``Crash'' (1997).
 &HT;    ``That's true, but it's often the case,'' Leigh says, laughing.
``A lot of directors you meet, who are the healthiest people, make
the strangest films.
 &HT;    ``The reverse is probably true, too,'' she adds, ``but I haven't
worked with a lot of those directors in my career!''
 &HT;    Which isn't hard to believe. Leigh is the actor equivalent of
Cronenberg, a veteran who does her own thing, generally outside the
mainstream. Her credits include ``Fast Times at Ridgemont High''
(1982), ``Last Exit to Brooklyn'' (1989), ``Backdraft'' (1991),
``Single White Female'' (1992), ``Short Cuts'' (1993), ``Dolores
Claiborne'' (1995), ``Georgia'' (1995) and ``Washington Square''
(1997).
 &HT;    There are few box-office smashes and barely a normal character
in the bunch, and Leigh wouldn't have it any other way.
 &HT;    ``If I can keep working without doing too much in the mainstream
that would be great,'' Leigh says. ``Luckily, I've been able to
earn my living doing the films I like, and I haven't had to do
mainstream films too often.
 &HT;    ``You really don't pick what's going to be commercial and what's
not,'' she adds. ``Nobody ever knows that. Honestly, I don't think
you can know that.
 &HT;    ``A lot of films people think will be hugely commercial bomb,''
Leigh says, ``and sometimes a movie that wasn't intended to be a
huge commercial thing hits for some reason. If people had a formula
that really worked, they'd use it more often.''
 &HT;    As for her own movies, she denies any interest in the commercial
end of her work.
 &HT;    ``A lot of the big commercial hits I don't like,'' she says. ``I
liked `Single White Female,' but didn't go into it thinking or
knowing it would be a commercial success.''
 &HT;    Fair enough, but Leigh had to know that its chances for a
lucrative box-office run far exceeded those of, say, ``Georgia,''
which she co-produced.
 &HT;    ``Maybe I did, but that's not why I choose my roles,'' she says.
```Single White Female' did have a better chance _ but, again, that
didn't mean it would be successful.
 &HT;    ``From my point of view, just because they put millions and
millions of dollars into advertising doesn't mean the movies will
make a lot of money,'' Leigh says. ``I'd rather do the films I
like.''
 &HT;    Which means joining forces with directors as willing to take
risks as she. Leigh has worked with most of today's most critically
acclaimed mavericks, including Cronenberg, Robert Altman, the Coen
brothers and Stanley Kubrick.
 &HT;    ``They're all hugely talented and they make their own movies,''
Leigh says. ``They don't make movies by committee. That's what
they've got in common.
 &HT;    ``Their movies set them apart,'' she says. ``Their visions,
ideas and stories set them apart. They're very different
filmmakers, but they're all really fantastic.''
 &HT;    If a Kubrick film featuring Leigh doesn't spring instantly to
mind, there's a reason. Leigh's scenes in Kubrick's swan song,
``Eyes Wide Shut,'' were cut after the actress couldn't return to
the set in London for additional filming.
 &HT;    ``He was brilliant, a total mensch,'' she says. ``I don't know
if he was as obsessive as everybody says he was. I didn't find him
obsessive in a horrible way _ I just found him to be incredibly
detailed and lovely.''
 &HT;    Never one to duck a challenge, Leigh recently took to the stage
in the Broadway revival of the musical ``Cabaret.'' She spent
several months starring as Sally Bowles in the production, to
reviews that generally praised her acting and panned her singing.
 &HT;    ``It was so much fun to do,'' she says. ``The cast was amazing,
and it was an incredible show to go into. Everybody was very
welcoming to me.
 &HT;    ``How fun it was to sing and dance on Broadway. It was insane.''
 &HT;    Speaking of insane, Leigh's next project, ``Beautiful View,''
casts her as a chambermaid obsessed with a guest at the hotel where
she's employed. The film will be directed by her mother, who penned
the script for Leigh.
 &HT;    As the interview comes to an end, Leigh contemplates what she
knows now about her craft that she didn't nearly 20 years ago, when
she made her acting debut in the television movie, ``The Best
Little Girl in the World'' (1981).
 &HT;    ``I think you learn from everyone you meet and everything you
do,'' she says. ``You learn something from every life experience.
Hopefully, you just get deeper and better.
 &HT;    ``I guess I just know more now,'' she says. ``I'm older. I've
lived more. I don't know that I've changed my approach, though, or
that I ever will.''

MATT GROENING: THE `FUTURAMA' IS NOW 
</HEADLINE>
  Includes a 200-word sidebar and a color slide of a scene from the
animated television series, ``Futurama.'' 
 By DAVID KRONKE  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The future isn't what it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, our future was usually seen as a fairly grim place,
depicted in such cautionary classics as ``1984'' (1956) _ which now
represents a future which is history, but that's another story _
``A Clockwork Orange'' (1971) or ``Blade Runner'' (1982).
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to the brave new world of ``Futurama,'' the new
animated series from ``The Simpsons'' mastermind Matt Groening and
co-creator David Cohen, the future is simply, well, silly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with science fiction is, if you posit a future as
a wonderful place, you're saying, `It doesn't matter how you do
things now, look how things turn out,''' Groening says. ``And if
you make it a dystopian future, you're saying, `It doesn't matter
what you do now, look how things turn out.' Our decision was to
make both good stuff and bad stuff, to play it both ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence ``Futurama,'' in which a 20th-century slacker named Fry is
frozen in a cryogenic pod for a millennium, then thaws out on an
Earth far different from the one which he left. His only friends
are Bender, a cranky robot, and Leela, a purple-haired cyclops and
apparently the only entity in the 30th century with a lick of
sense.
</P>
<P>
   And if they somewhat remind you of a dysfunctional 20th-century
family, maybe even a specific, animated one that inhabits the Fox
prime-time lineup, well ...
</P>
<P>
   ``There are definite similarities _ they both have big eyeballs
and no chins,'' Groening admits. ``That's just what you get out of
my pen. Look, it's basically Springfield, in that Springfield is a
mix of the wonderful and the horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Groening promises a whole new take on television science fiction
in ``Futurama.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great things is, we have none of the limitations of
live action,'' the cartoonist says. ``In live action, the
characters are always looking out of portholes, and they beam down
onto what looks like a Hollywood back lot. I guarantee you won't
see any episodes set in the old West, nor with 1920s gangsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can draw anything we want,'' he says cheerfully. ``We don't
have to beam down _ we can actually land. Because of the sci-fi
backdrop, and because we're having fun with some of the epic
grandeur of sci-fi, it has a richer look.''
</P>
<P>
   For that, Groening credits the animation studio Rough Draft,
which he first encountered when it created some
``Simpsons''-related commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do a fantastic job,'' he says. ``I took my son over there
for the first time last weekend. He was amazed to meet grown men
who play with toys! He was really happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Claudia Katz, who is the Rough Draft producer for ``Futurama,''
shares Groening's ambitions for the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all the episodes we've done, we've never gone to the same
place twice, which is both a blessing and a curse,'' she says.
``Basically, every week we're designing a whole new Springfield.
But it lets our designers strut their stuff and show off. Sometimes
the writers will just put in their scripts, `Designers _ knock
yourselves out.'''
</P>
<P>
   Together, Groening and Rough Draft have created what Katz calls
``a low-tech high-tech look, sort of how the future was supposed to
look back in the '40s and '50s.'' Future episodes include a visit
to a planet with three suns, a trek to a planet of virulent,
human-loathing robots and, yes, a space-bound ``Titanic'' parody.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're able to write gags for robots,'' Groening says, ``which
are great because they're characters who feel no guilt.''
</P>
<P>
   Groening is the first to admit that he only provides the
framework for large writing staffs who create the scripts for his
shows. He can't even calculate how many different writers have
worked on the last decade of ``The Simpsons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my God,'' he says, ``I never thought of that. It must be
... I have no idea. Over 60.''
</P>
<P>
   The same perfectionism that wore out those dozens of writers
also challenges his animators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt's always impressive, but that can be frustrating,'' Katz
says. ``He can walk in and make a change _ it's always a great
change, he has a great eye _ but we had just spent a month working
on what he changed.''
</P>
<P>
   When ``The Simpsons'' hit the air a decade ago, it was the only
prime-time animated series. Today prime-time animation is rampant _
nearly a half-dozen new series have been scheduled or announced by
networks since January. Groening's crucial insight _ that cartoons
didn't have to be exclusively for children _ has ironically
produced a flock of competitors for the crown of ``The Simpsons,''
competitors that might also damage ``Futurama's'' chances.
</P>
<P>
   But he claims he doesn't mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm such a fan of animation,'' he says. ``I love seeing a
great piece of animation. Animation in the '90s doesn't look like
everything else _ people do their own unique vision, and that I
find refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to come up with innovations in live-action
sitcoms,'' he adds. ``It's pretty much been the same thing for 50
years. I'm sick of that too, but now `The PJs' looks like nothing
else. And `King of the Hill' has created its own observational
humor. I love them, and can't wait to see the others.''
</P>
<P>
   Groening offers up the ironic punch line to his success as an
animation mogul: When he first picked up a pen and doodled _ on
childhood sketches that eventually evolved into the comic strip
``Life In Hell,'' which he still draws today _ no one foresaw a
lucrative future.
</P>
<P>
   ``My secret shame is when I was a kid, I drew bunny rabbits a
lot, and it didn't impress anyone,'' he says with a laugh. ``People
would say, `Oh, look, a bunny rabbit!' And I'd say, `No, it's a
serious rabbit, not a bunny rabbit.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But now, looking at it, I have to admit they were right. They
are bunny rabbits.'' &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; SIDEBAR: IN THE FUTURE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The more things change, the more they stay the same _ ludicrous,
that is. It's particularly so in ``Futurama.'' Here's the way
creator Matt Groening sees things 1,000 years from now:
</P>
<P>
   + ``The Simpsons'' is still on the air, but people complain that
the first 500 years were better than the second 500.
</P>
<P>
   They have a point, Groening admits: ``There were too many clip
shows in the second 500 years. There were 130 years of clip
shows.''
</P>
<P>
   + The Internet still exists, ``and it's still too slow.''
</P>
<P>
   + Celebrated 20th-century figures, including Groening himself,
still exist, but as heads in jars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It beats the alternative,'' Groening says with a shrug. ``I
have mixed feelings about being a head in a jar.''
</P>
<P>
   + Most shockingly, the television-network situation has reversed
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Three are gone _ Fox has emerged triumphant,''
Groening reports.
</P>
<P>
   He had also declared that UPN would still be around _ and still
be dead last in the ratings _ but he's since backed off.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an easy joke, like a joke on Jay Leno,'' he says. ``I'm
not proud of that. I've been writing TV long enough to construct
bad jokes.''

 AUDRA McDONALD IS HAVING HER SAY  
 Includes a color slide of Audra McDonald with Lisa Arrindell
Anderson in a scene from ``Having Our Say.'' 
 By MICHAEL J. BANDLER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Call Audra McDonald the entertainment industry's stealth weapon.
 &HT;    The most celebrated musical-theater actress of her generation _
at 28, she already has three Tony Awards _ she's also won a growing
number of fans as a recording artist. But despite the hurrahs of
those who saw her on Broadway last year in ``Ragtime,'' she's still
an unfamiliar name to audiences outside New York.
 &HT;    For now, anyway. Her breakthrough just might be the television
movie ``Having Our Say,'' which will air April 18 on CBS. Adapted
from Emily Mann's acclaimed stage play _ based on the 1993
bestseller of the same name _ ``Having Our Say'' is the true story
of more than 100 years of African-American history as seen through
the eyes of two sisters, Sarah ``Sadie'' and A. Elizabeth
``Bessie'' Delany.
 &HT;    They saw black America from the Jim Crow era through the 1990s,
and from Raleigh, N.C. _ where the sisters were born as the
children of an Episcopal bishop _ to 1910s New York, where they
attended Columbia University and went on to careers of their own,
Sadie as a schoolteacher and Bessie as a dentist. Bessie Delany
died in 1995 at 104, her sister in 1999 at 109.
 &HT;    McDonald plays the feisty Bessie during her prime, with Lisa
Arrindell Anderson playing Sadie. Ruby Dee and Diahann Carroll play
the sisters as old women.
 &HT;    The first time she read the Delanys' memoir, the actress says,
her first reaction was, ``I have nothing to complain about _
absolutely nothing! And shame on me if I do. Because I have 95
billion percent more chance of getting anywhere I want to be than
these women did and, in my opinion, they far surpassed anything
I've already done _ especially considering the odds they had to
work against.''
 &HT;    The sisters have something important to say to black Americans,
she adds.
 &HT;    ``There's a lot of bitterness and anger within certain aspects
of the black community today that's residual from years past,'' she
says. ``The Delany sisters talk a lot about how you can't hold
bitterness in your heart _ it will ruin your life.''
 &HT;    McDonald grew up in a family not unlike the Delanys, with roots
in rural Virginia and a bedrock commitment to education as the road
to success.
 &HT;    ``Some of the things their father was telling them I have heard
firsthand from my parents, obviously parroting things they heard
from their parents,'' she says. ``They talked about the importance
of a college education, because no matter what happens in your
life, no one can ever take that away from you. You've got that
paper.
 &HT;    ``When I graduated from Juilliard and came home to Fresno,'' she
recalls, ``the first thing my dad said when I got off the plane
was, `Where's the diploma?' That was most important _ a real tool,
a weapon, to use in society for fighting racism.''
 &HT;    The actress comes from a musical family in which, as she puts
it, ``everybody's made some sort of noise with some sort of
instrument or with their throat.'' Her father was a college music
major, her mother was a piano teacher with a master's degree in
music and her aunts and mother even formed a gospel group, the
McDonald Sisters, some years back.
 &HT;    Young Audra, who had been performing in community theater since
she was 9, burst onto the Broadway scene in 1994, fresh out of
Manhattan's Juilliard School. As Carrie Pipperidge in the Lincoln
Center revival of ``Carousel,'' she won her first Tony Award. The
next year she won another for her bristling performance in ``The
Master Class,'' as a budding opera singer being coached by Zoe
Caldwell's Maria Callas. She won her third in 1998 for her
performance as the tragic Sarah in ``Ragtime.''
 &HT;    Her characters are typically passionate women who teeter on the
edge between achievement and disaster. It's an edge which McDonald
knows well since her Juilliard days.
 &HT;    At the prestigious performing-arts school, the singing program
traditionally inclines toward opera. Though blessed with an
awesomely rich operatic voice, McDonald was already enthralled by
the Broadway stage. She spent her first few months at Juilliard
fighting what she calls ``the operatic thing.'' That struggle,
combined with a couple of personal relationships that ``spiraled
downward,'' resulted in a brief breakdown, what she calls a
``mental vacation.''
 &HT;    Fellow students, her parents and therapy helped McDonald through
her crisis, reinforcing her faith in her own sense of her destiny.
Once secure in that, McDonald says, she decided that Juilliard
``should become my friend.''
 &HT;    The rest, as they say, is history.
 &HT;    That experience helped her re-enact a crucial juncture in Bessie
Delany's life. In 1913, en route to a teaching position in Georgia,
she and two other black teachers from New York were sitting in the
``colored'' waiting room of a train station in Waycross, Ga., when
a drunken white man approached and began harassing them.
 &HT;    As he screamed invectives, Bessie's colleagues fled, and a crowd
began to form on the platform. But she continued to sit on the
bench, combing her hair until the train finally came to whisk her
away.
 &HT;    ``I think that's when she realizes how special she is,'' the
actress says, ``that she can take care of herself and is worthy of
that which she seeks and that which she stands for. That's when she
finally cuts her teeth as Bessie.
 &HT;    ``Till her dying day, she was still riled up about that,''
McDonald adds. ``She'd say, `You know, I don't take tea for fever,'
which I take to mean, `Nothing's going to calm me down. If I'm this
angry about something, nothing will be a salve for me. Once I'm
angry, I'm gone!'''
 &HT;    ``Having Our Say'' was McDonald's first experience acting for a
camera instead of an audience, and she admits that she found it
awkward at first.
 &HT;    ``I would much rather get up in front of 100,000 people I don't
know and sing and dance,'' she says. ``For a while, I was very
afraid of the camera. I was like, `Get that thing away from me! Why
is it looking at me?'
 &HT;    ``But then Lynne Littman, the director, told me, `It's like a
member of the audience, and you can't hide from it.' Once she made
that correlation I started to calm down, and it made all the
difference in the world.''
 &HT;    Don't look for McDonald to go Hollywood, though. This summer
she'll be back on the concert stage, appearing at the Tanglewood
Music Festival and elsewhere on tour. She'll also be singing on
film, appearing briefly in Tim Robbins' 1930s political drama,
``Cradle Will Rock,'' as a composer's muse. And toward the end of
the year she'll be starring in Michael John LaChiusa's new musical,
``Marie Christine,'' to be staged at Lincoln Center.
 &HT;    It's no accident that McDonald's next Broadway musical, like her
last, is an original work. She's a great supporter of the new
generation of musical-theater creators, excited by her conviction
that ``dramatic intent is now driving the compositional piece _
lines are being erased, borders are being erased.''
 &HT;    She admits that her advocacy is at root ``a selfish thing. I
want new and exciting projects out there for me, as well as for
everyone else. So it's an investment in my future as well as
theirs, as well as in the future of musical theater.''
 &HT;    Still, she says, she welcomes film and television opportunities
such as ``Having Our Say,'' chances to expose herself to new ideas
and new audiences.
 &HT;    ``It's good to challenge yourself,'' she says. ``As Bessie and
Sadie certainly would say, `Don't be afraid of anything new!'''

ANGELINA JOLIE IS `PUSHING' FOR STARDOM

 Includes a color slide of Angelina Jolie with Billy Bob Thornton in
a scene from ``Pushing Tin.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Even the hottest young actress in Hollywood knows when it's time
to cool off.
 &HT;    After winning a Golden Globe Award for her role in the
television movie ``Gia,'' Angelina Jolie pushed past the press
waiting outside, kicked off her heels and dove into the
Olympic-sized pool at the Beverly Hills Hotel.
 &HT;    Never mind her Randolph Duke dress with its 5,000
antique-crystal beads. Never mind her carefully coifed hairdo or
the Harry Winston baubles that surely weren't meant for moonlight
dips.
 &HT;    ``It surprised me that no one else jumped in the pool with me,''
the 23-year-old Jolie says. ``Here I am, at an event with the
wildest actors in the business, and everyone was so tame and
serious. My question is, `Why wouldn't you want to jump into a
pool?'''
 &HT;    If you think that's unusual, try this: After her award-winning
turn in ``Gia,'' she actually contemplated quitting show business,
just as her agent's phone was starting to ring.
 &HT;    ``I was at a place in my life where I had everything I thought
you should have to make you happy,'' she recalls, ``and I felt
emptier than ever. I thought after `Gia' that I had given
everything I had to offer, and I didn't find myself growing.
 &HT;    ``I didn't have the strength to deal with Hollywood,'' she says
over breakfast at the Ritz Carlton in Pasadena, Calif. The lips
that have been described as being ``the size of sectional sofas''
curve in a frown.
 &HT;    ``I just needed to get away and find myself,'' she concludes.
 &HT;    Finding herself, in this case, meant going back to school for
some film classes.
 &HT;    ``It was at that point I realized how lucky I was to be on a
film set,'' she says. ``I suddenly appreciated my career, and I
started opening up again to Hollywood. I started to feel like the
fans I suddenly had weren't threatening to my life, but through my
work they were letting me in their life.''
 &HT;    A lot more people will be doing that after the April 23 release
of ``Pushing Tin,'' in which Jolie plays the knockout wife of a
macho, risk-taking air-traffic controller (Billy Bob Thornton).
Depressed, she winds up having an affair with another controller
(John Cusack), who happens to be her husband's main rival.
 &HT;    And, yes, going behind the scenes in the frenzied world of
air-traffic control made her a little nervous.
 &HT;    ``I had to keep reminding myself, `You're not going to die on a
plane. There is just no way,'' the actress says. ``In fact, I'm the
one who asks for the exit rows, because I want to be the one who
gets everyone out.
 &HT;    ``I'm not scared of much,'' she adds, ``because I really do live
by the creed that I might die tomorrow. In fact, I'm surprised I'm
still here. Honestly, I'm the kind of person who always could feel
the clock ticking.''
 &HT;    These are troubled times for Jolie, who is recently divorced
from ``Trainspotting'' star Jonny Lee Miller.
 &HT;    ``We're great friends, and I love him to death,'' she says.
``We've been going through this breakup so slowly because we want
each other to have all that we need in life right now.''
 &HT;    Her voice lowers.
 &HT;    ``Right now we need to do things separately, but it's all done
from love,'' she says. ``We're both holding each other's hand
through this, and it's been amazing _ the divorce has actually
brought us closer. I still consider him my husband.''
 &HT;    The other man in her life is, of course, her father,
Oscar-winning actor Jon Voight. In fact, it was in one of his
movies _ ``Looking to Get Out'' (1982) _ that the 6-year-old Jolie
made her screen debut.
 &HT;    ``I don't have many memories,'' she says. ``I basically remember
being in a hotel room with my brother and dancing on the bed
because we were so bored.''
 &HT;    Jolie's mother, actress Marcheline Bertrand, divorced her father
when she was an infant. Jolie lived with her, but spent weekends
with her father.
 &HT;    ``I would stage readings of plays in my living room,'' Voight
recalls in a separate interview. ``I remember, when Angie was 16,
she would stun us with powerful performances.''
 &HT;    Smitten, the young woman trained at the Lee Strasberg Theatre
Institute and then hit Hollywood. Early roles in ``Hackers'' (1995)
and ``Foxfire'' (1996) led to a role as the wife of the title
character in the cable movie ``George Wallace'' (1997). More
recently she was seen in ``Playing By Heart'' (1999), and she also
appeared in the Rolling Stones video, ``Has Anybody Seen My Baby?''
 &HT;    She shakes her head at the memory.
 &HT;    ``I didn't know what the Rolling Stones wanted,'' she says.
``Imagine my surprise when they wanted me to walk down the streets
in basically my underwear.
 &HT;    ``The great thing is that it was New York,'' she adds, ``and no
one cared. People in restaurants were like, `Oh, there goes the
girl from ``Gia'' in her drawers.'''
 &HT;    Next up is ``The Bone Collector,'' in which she plays a cop
teamed with a paraplegic officer (Denzel Washington) in an effort
to solve a string of murders.
 &HT;    She's currently filming ``Girl Interrupted,'' set in a 1960s
women's mental institution and co-starring Winona Ryder.
 &HT;    ``I've actually spent the last week strapped to a bed, which ...
'' Jolie begins, then laughs. ``There is something so strange and
kinky to all this stuff. And awful _ I spent a week in solitary
with a straitjacket on, too.
 &HT;    ``I have to make light of this film, because it's pretty heavy
stuff,'' she says more seriously. ``It's set in the '60s, when
girls were sent to a mental hospital because they were gay. Women
got shock treatments and they didn't remember their family a week
later.''
 &HT;    As her three high-profile roles suggest, Jolie is in the process
of moving from the ``promising'' category to the ``star'' category.
It's a process that she admits she still can't quite comprehend.
 &HT;    ``It's so weird,'' she says. ``Let's take `The Bone Collector.'
I've seen the poster, which is me with a gun and a walkie-talkie.
In my mind, I look like I'm 5, playing dress-up.''
 &HT;    Less easy to accept is the media attention that comes with
stardom. She and her father posed for a portrait in a recent issue
of Vanity Fair, which Jolie is seeing for the first time. She flips
to the picture, and then scowls.
 &HT;    ``Oh, this is hysterical,'' she says tightly, reading the
caption aloud with an edge to her voice. ```Angelina, a bad girl,
wears death tattoos and rubber clothes and likes to play with
knives. Some of this seems to have rubbed off on her old man.'''
 &HT;    Jolie fumes.
 &HT;    ``OK,'' she says grimly, ``I think I need to make some phone
calls when this interview is over.''
 &HT;    A few sips of orange juice later, she calms down.
 &HT;    ``I don't really take any of this stuff seriously,'' she says.
``I mean, how hot can I be? I'm really this goofy little odd
person, and someday the rest of the world will discover it. They'll
find out that the girl in those evening dresses is really a
complete idiot who spills coffee on herself and broke the phone by
falling over it this morning.
 &HT;    ``I'm one of the flawed people,'' she concludes. ``I just hide
it well.''

EXISTENZIALIST: JENNIFER JASON LEIGH TAKES ANOTHER WALK ON THE WILD

 Includes a color slide of Jennifer Jason Leigh with Jude Law in a
scene from ``Existenz.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Jennifer Jason Leigh has spent the last decade or two playing
square pegs in round holes.
 &HT;    Her latest film, ``Existenz,'' casts her as another misfit, a
superstar virtual-reality-game designer on the lam after an
assassination attempt. It's not hard to see in the awkward,
antisocial Allegra Geller something of Leigh herself, a private and
enigmatic actress who has been called a reluctant star.
 &HT;    The comparisons are not lost on Leigh.
 &HT;    ``I liked seeing a bit of myself in Allegra,'' she says. ``I
liked the idea of playing someone who's very shy and uncomfortable
with people _ I certainly understood that.
 &HT;    ``Allegra is really, really uncomfortable with people,'' Leigh
adds. ```The hell with people' is her motto. It's something I've
sort of said for years, too, but Allegra practically wears it.
 &HT;    ``It's almost pathological how shy she is,'' she says, ``which
is partly because of the work she does. She doesn't have to deal
with people. It's only in the game-testing phase that she has to
face the press, and it's very painful for her.
 &HT;    ``And you know what? It is for me, too. I'm not comfortable. I
love to work, but I don't like to talk about my work or myself that
much, and it doesn't come easy to me.''
 &HT;    Leigh, the 37-year-old daughter of writer/producer Barbara
Turner and the late actor Vic Morrow, laughs.
 &HT;    ``I'm not quite as shy as Allegra,'' she says, ``but I'm
close.''
 &HT;    Written and directed by David Cronenberg, ``Existenz'' _ or, as
the promotions would have it, ``eXistenZ'' _ opens on April 23.
It's a futuristic drama that finds Geller in hiding, accompanied
only by unarmed security guard Ted Pikul (Jude Law), as she tries
to sort out the complications of her new game, eXistenZ, which
thrusts them _ and moviegoers _ into a bizarre universe that blurs
the lines between fantasy and reality.
 &HT;    ``For me, the film is about the desire to escape,'' Leigh says
by telephone from her home in Los Angeles. ``It's very funny and
it's also an existential film, in that you create your reality
moment by moment.
 &HT;    ``I love that the film works on so many levels,'' she says.
``Even playing the scenes, from take to take, there were different
choices to make all the time.
 &HT;    ``It was challenging and exciting to keep track of the levels,
but I wouldn't say it was hard,'' she concludes. ``Jude and I would
just look at each other and say, `Let's do it this way or that
way.'''
 &HT;    Working with Cronenberg was a unique experience, the actress
says.
 &HT;    ``We weren't allowed to change the dialogue, but we could
interpret it any old way,'' she says. ``He enjoys that. David is
lovely to work with, incredibly intelligent, very easygoing and
funny.''
 &HT;    Actors who work with Cronenberg tend to come away saying that
it's hard to believe that so normal a guy could have directed such
out-there brainbenders as ``Scanners'' (1981), ``Videodrome''
(1982), ``Dead Ringers'' (1988) and ``Crash'' (1997).
 &HT;    ``That's true, but it's often the case,'' Leigh says, laughing.
``A lot of directors you meet, who are the healthiest people, make
the strangest films.
 &HT;    ``The reverse is probably true, too,'' she adds, ``but I haven't
worked with a lot of those directors in my career!''
 &HT;    Which isn't hard to believe. Leigh is the actor equivalent of
Cronenberg, a veteran who does her own thing, generally outside the
mainstream. Her credits include ``Fast Times at Ridgemont High''
(1982), ``Last Exit to Brooklyn'' (1989), ``Backdraft'' (1991),
``Single White Female'' (1992), ``Short Cuts'' (1993), ``Dolores
Claiborne'' (1995), ``Georgia'' (1995) and ``Washington Square''
(1997).
 &HT;    There are few box-office smashes and barely a normal character
in the bunch, and Leigh wouldn't have it any other way.
 &HT;    ``If I can keep working without doing too much in the mainstream
that would be great,'' Leigh says. ``Luckily, I've been able to
earn my living doing the films I like, and I haven't had to do
mainstream films too often.
 &HT;    ``You really don't pick what's going to be commercial and what's
not,'' she adds. ``Nobody ever knows that. Honestly, I don't think
you can know that.
 &HT;    ``A lot of films people think will be hugely commercial bomb,''
Leigh says, ``and sometimes a movie that wasn't intended to be a
huge commercial thing hits for some reason. If people had a formula
that really worked, they'd use it more often.''
 &HT;    As for her own movies, she denies any interest in the commercial
end of her work.
 &HT;    ``A lot of the big commercial hits I don't like,'' she says. ``I
liked `Single White Female,' but didn't go into it thinking or
knowing it would be a commercial success.''
 &HT;    Fair enough, but Leigh had to know that its chances for a
lucrative box-office run far exceeded those of, say, ``Georgia,''
which she co-produced.
 &HT;    ``Maybe I did, but that's not why I choose my roles,'' she says.
```Single White Female' did have a better chance _ but, again, that
didn't mean it would be successful.
 &HT;    ``From my point of view, just because they put millions and
millions of dollars into advertising doesn't mean the movies will
make a lot of money,'' Leigh says. ``I'd rather do the films I
like.''
 &HT;    Which means joining forces with directors as willing to take
risks as she. Leigh has worked with most of today's most critically
acclaimed mavericks, including Cronenberg, Robert Altman, the Coen
brothers and Stanley Kubrick.
 &HT;    ``They're all hugely talented and they make their own movies,''
Leigh says. ``They don't make movies by committee. That's what
they've got in common.
 &HT;    ``Their movies set them apart,'' she says. ``Their visions,
ideas and stories set them apart. They're very different
filmmakers, but they're all really fantastic.''
 &HT;    If a Kubrick film featuring Leigh doesn't spring instantly to
mind, there's a reason. Leigh's scenes in Kubrick's swan song,
``Eyes Wide Shut,'' were cut after the actress couldn't return to
the set in London for additional filming.
 &HT;    ``He was brilliant, a total mensch,'' she says. ``I don't know
if he was as obsessive as everybody says he was. I didn't find him
obsessive in a horrible way _ I just found him to be incredibly
detailed and lovely.''
 &HT;    Never one to duck a challenge, Leigh recently took to the stage
in the Broadway revival of the musical ``Cabaret.'' She spent
several months starring as Sally Bowles in the production, to
reviews that generally praised her acting and panned her singing.
 &HT;    ``It was so much fun to do,'' she says. ``The cast was amazing,
and it was an incredible show to go into. Everybody was very
welcoming to me.
 &HT;    ``How fun it was to sing and dance on Broadway. It was insane.''
 &HT;    Speaking of insane, Leigh's next project, ``Beautiful View,''
casts her as a chambermaid obsessed with a guest at the hotel where
she's employed. The film will be directed by her mother, who penned
the script for Leigh.
 &HT;    As the interview comes to an end, Leigh contemplates what she
knows now about her craft that she didn't nearly 20 years ago, when
she made her acting debut in the television movie, ``The Best
Little Girl in the World'' (1981).
 &HT;    ``I think you learn from everyone you meet and everything you
do,'' she says. ``You learn something from every life experience.
Hopefully, you just get deeper and better.
 &HT;    ``I guess I just know more now,'' she says. ``I'm older. I've
lived more. I don't know that I've changed my approach, though, or
that I ever will.''

MATT GROENING: THE `FUTURAMA' IS NOW

 Includes a 200-word sidebar and a color slide of a scene from the
animated television series, ``Futurama.'' 
 By DAVID KRONKE  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The future isn't what it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, our future was usually seen as a fairly grim place,
depicted in such cautionary classics as ``1984'' (1956) _ which now
represents a future which is history, but that's another story _
``A Clockwork Orange'' (1971) or ``Blade Runner'' (1982).
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to the brave new world of ``Futurama,'' the new
animated series from ``The Simpsons'' mastermind Matt Groening and
co-creator David Cohen, the future is simply, well, silly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with science fiction is, if you posit a future as
a wonderful place, you're saying, `It doesn't matter how you do
things now, look how things turn out,''' Groening says. ``And if
you make it a dystopian future, you're saying, `It doesn't matter
what you do now, look how things turn out.' Our decision was to
make both good stuff and bad stuff, to play it both ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence ``Futurama,'' in which a 20th-century slacker named Fry is
frozen in a cryogenic pod for a millennium, then thaws out on an
Earth far different from the one which he left. His only friends
are Bender, a cranky robot, and Leela, a purple-haired cyclops and
apparently the only entity in the 30th century with a lick of
sense.
</P>
<P>
   And if they somewhat remind you of a dysfunctional 20th-century
family, maybe even a specific, animated one that inhabits the Fox
prime-time lineup, well ...
</P>
<P>
   ``There are definite similarities _ they both have big eyeballs
and no chins,'' Groening admits. ``That's just what you get out of
my pen. Look, it's basically Springfield, in that Springfield is a
mix of the wonderful and the horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Groening promises a whole new take on television science fiction
in ``Futurama.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great things is, we have none of the limitations of
live action,'' the cartoonist says. ``In live action, the
characters are always looking out of portholes, and they beam down
onto what looks like a Hollywood back lot. I guarantee you won't
see any episodes set in the old West, nor with 1920s gangsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can draw anything we want,'' he says cheerfully. ``We don't
have to beam down _ we can actually land. Because of the sci-fi
backdrop, and because we're having fun with some of the epic
grandeur of sci-fi, it has a richer look.''
</P>
<P>
   For that, Groening credits the animation studio Rough Draft,
which he first encountered when it created some
``Simpsons''-related commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do a fantastic job,'' he says. ``I took my son over there
for the first time last weekend. He was amazed to meet grown men
who play with toys! He was really happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Claudia Katz, who is the Rough Draft producer for ``Futurama,''
shares Groening's ambitions for the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all the episodes we've done, we've never gone to the same
place twice, which is both a blessing and a curse,'' she says.
``Basically, every week we're designing a whole new Springfield.
But it lets our designers strut their stuff and show off. Sometimes
the writers will just put in their scripts, `Designers _ knock
yourselves out.'''
</P>
<P>
   Together, Groening and Rough Draft have created what Katz calls
``a low-tech high-tech look, sort of how the future was supposed to
look back in the '40s and '50s.'' Future episodes include a visit
to a planet with three suns, a trek to a planet of virulent,
human-loathing robots and, yes, a space-bound ``Titanic'' parody.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're able to write gags for robots,'' Groening says, ``which
are great because they're characters who feel no guilt.''
</P>
<P>
   Groening is the first to admit that he only provides the
framework for large writing staffs who create the scripts for his
shows. He can't even calculate how many different writers have
worked on the last decade of ``The Simpsons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my God,'' he says, ``I never thought of that. It must be
... I have no idea. Over 60.''
</P>
<P>
   The same perfectionism that wore out those dozens of writers
also challenges his animators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt's always impressive, but that can be frustrating,'' Katz
says. ``He can walk in and make a change _ it's always a great
change, he has a great eye _ but we had just spent a month working
on what he changed.''
</P>
<P>
   When ``The Simpsons'' hit the air a decade ago, it was the only
prime-time animated series. Today prime-time animation is rampant _
nearly a half-dozen new series have been scheduled or announced by
networks since January. Groening's crucial insight _ that cartoons
didn't have to be exclusively for children _ has ironically
produced a flock of competitors for the crown of ``The Simpsons,''
competitors that might also damage ``Futurama's'' chances.
</P>
<P>
   But he claims he doesn't mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm such a fan of animation,'' he says. ``I love seeing a
great piece of animation. Animation in the '90s doesn't look like
everything else _ people do their own unique vision, and that I
find refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to come up with innovations in live-action
sitcoms,'' he adds. ``It's pretty much been the same thing for 50
years. I'm sick of that too, but now `The PJs' looks like nothing
else. And `King of the Hill' has created its own observational
humor. I love them, and can't wait to see the others.''
</P>
<P>
   Groening offers up the ironic punch line to his success as an
animation mogul: When he first picked up a pen and doodled _ on
childhood sketches that eventually evolved into the comic strip
``Life In Hell,'' which he still draws today _ no one foresaw a
lucrative future.
</P>
<P>
   ``My secret shame is when I was a kid, I drew bunny rabbits a
lot, and it didn't impress anyone,'' he says with a laugh. ``People
would say, `Oh, look, a bunny rabbit!' And I'd say, `No, it's a
serious rabbit, not a bunny rabbit.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But now, looking at it, I have to admit they were right. They
are bunny rabbits.'' &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; SIDEBAR: IN THE FUTURE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The more things change, the more they stay the same _ ludicrous,
that is. It's particularly so in ``Futurama.'' Here's the way
creator Matt Groening sees things 1,000 years from now:
</P>
<P>
   + ``The Simpsons'' is still on the air, but people complain that
the first 500 years were better than the second 500.
</P>
<P>
   They have a point, Groening admits: ``There were too many clip
shows in the second 500 years. There were 130 years of clip
shows.''
</P>
<P>
   + The Internet still exists, ``and it's still too slow.''
</P>
<P>
   + Celebrated 20th-century figures, including Groening himself,
still exist, but as heads in jars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It beats the alternative,'' Groening says with a shrug. ``I
have mixed feelings about being a head in a jar.''
</P>
<P>
   + Most shockingly, the television-network situation has reversed
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Three are gone _ Fox has emerged triumphant,''
Groening reports.
</P>
<P>
   He had also declared that UPN would still be around _ and still
be dead last in the ratings _ but he's since backed off.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an easy joke, like a joke on Jay Leno,'' he says. ``I'm
not proud of that. I've been writing TV long enough to construct
bad jokes.''

 AUDRA McDONALD IS HAVING HER SAY  
 (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 Includes a color slide of Audra McDonald with Lisa Arrindell
Anderson in a scene from ``Having Our Say.'' 
 By MICHAEL J. BANDLER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Call Audra McDonald the entertainment industry's stealth weapon.
 &HT;    The most celebrated musical-theater actress of her generation _
at 28, she already has three Tony Awards _ she's also won a growing
number of fans as a recording artist. But despite the hurrahs of
those who saw her on Broadway last year in ``Ragtime,'' she's still
an unfamiliar name to audiences outside New York.
 &HT;    For now, anyway. Her breakthrough just might be the television
movie ``Having Our Say,'' which will air April 18 on CBS. Adapted
from Emily Mann's acclaimed stage play _ based on the 1993
bestseller of the same name _ ``Having Our Say'' is the true story
of more than 100 years of African-American history as seen through
the eyes of two sisters, Sarah ``Sadie'' and A. Elizabeth
``Bessie'' Delany.
 &HT;    They saw black America from the Jim Crow era through the 1990s,
and from Raleigh, N.C. _ where the sisters were born as the
children of an Episcopal bishop _ to 1910s New York, where they
attended Columbia University and went on to careers of their own,
Sadie as a schoolteacher and Bessie as a dentist. Bessie Delany
died in 1995 at 104, her sister in 1999 at 109.
 &HT;    McDonald plays the feisty Bessie during her prime, with Lisa
Arrindell Anderson playing Sadie. Ruby Dee and Diahann Carroll play
the sisters as old women.
 &HT;    The first time she read the Delanys' memoir, the actress says,
her first reaction was, ``I have nothing to complain about _
absolutely nothing! And shame on me if I do. Because I have 95
billion percent more chance of getting anywhere I want to be than
these women did and, in my opinion, they far surpassed anything
I've already done _ especially considering the odds they had to
work against.''
 &HT;    The sisters have something important to say to black Americans,
she adds.
 &HT;    ``There's a lot of bitterness and anger within certain aspects
of the black community today that's residual from years past,'' she
says. ``The Delany sisters talk a lot about how you can't hold
bitterness in your heart _ it will ruin your life.''
 &HT;    McDonald grew up in a family not unlike the Delanys, with roots
in rural Virginia and a bedrock commitment to education as the road
to success.
 &HT;    ``Some of the things their father was telling them I have heard
firsthand from my parents, obviously parroting things they heard
from their parents,'' she says. ``They talked about the importance
of a college education, because no matter what happens in your
life, no one can ever take that away from you. You've got that
paper.
 &HT;    ``When I graduated from Juilliard and came home to Fresno,'' she
recalls, ``the first thing my dad said when I got off the plane
was, `Where's the diploma?' That was most important _ a real tool,
a weapon, to use in society for fighting racism.''
 &HT;    The actress comes from a musical family in which, as she puts
it, ``everybody's made some sort of noise with some sort of
instrument or with their throat.'' Her father was a college music
major, her mother was a piano teacher with a master's degree in
music and her aunts and mother even formed a gospel group, the
McDonald Sisters, some years back.
 &HT;    Young Audra, who had been performing in community theater since
she was 9, burst onto the Broadway scene in 1994, fresh out of
Manhattan's Juilliard School. As Carrie Pipperidge in the Lincoln
Center revival of ``Carousel,'' she won her first Tony Award. The
next year she won another for her bristling performance in ``The
Master Class,'' as a budding opera singer being coached by Zoe
Caldwell's Maria Callas. She won her third in 1998 for her
performance as the tragic Sarah in ``Ragtime.''
 &HT;    Her characters are typically passionate women who teeter on the
edge between achievement and disaster. It's an edge which McDonald
knows well since her Juilliard days.
 &HT;    At the prestigious performing-arts school, the singing program
traditionally inclines toward opera. Though blessed with an
awesomely rich operatic voice, McDonald was already enthralled by
the Broadway stage. She spent her first few months at Juilliard
fighting what she calls ``the operatic thing.'' That struggle,
combined with a couple of personal relationships that ``spiraled
downward,'' resulted in a brief breakdown, what she calls a
``mental vacation.''
 &HT;    Fellow students, her parents and therapy helped McDonald through
her crisis, reinforcing her faith in her own sense of her destiny.
Once secure in that, McDonald says, she decided that Juilliard
``should become my friend.''
 &HT;    The rest, as they say, is history.
 &HT;    That experience helped her re-enact a crucial juncture in Bessie
Delany's life. In 1913, en route to a teaching position in Georgia,
she and two other black teachers from New York were sitting in the
``colored'' waiting room of a train station in Waycross, Ga., when
a drunken white man approached and began harassing them.
 &HT;    As he screamed invectives, Bessie's colleagues fled, and a crowd
began to form on the platform. But she continued to sit on the
bench, combing her hair until the train finally came to whisk her
away.
 &HT;    ``I think that's when she realizes how special she is,'' the
actress says, ``that she can take care of herself and is worthy of
that which she seeks and that which she stands for. That's when she
finally cuts her teeth as Bessie.
 &HT;    ``Till her dying day, she was still riled up about that,''
McDonald adds. ``She'd say, `You know, I don't take tea for fever,'
which I take to mean, `Nothing's going to calm me down. If I'm this
angry about something, nothing will be a salve for me. Once I'm
angry, I'm gone!'''
 &HT;    ``Having Our Say'' was McDonald's first experience acting for a
camera instead of an audience, and she admits that she found it
awkward at first.
 &HT;    ``I would much rather get up in front of 100,000 people I don't
know and sing and dance,'' she says. ``For a while, I was very
afraid of the camera. I was like, `Get that thing away from me! Why
is it looking at me?'
 &HT;    ``But then Lynne Littman, the director, told me, `It's like a
member of the audience, and you can't hide from it.' Once she made
that correlation I started to calm down, and it made all the
difference in the world.''
 &HT;    Don't look for McDonald to go Hollywood, though. This summer
she'll be back on the concert stage, appearing at the Tanglewood
Music Festival and elsewhere on tour. She'll also be singing on
film, appearing briefly in Tim Robbins' 1930s political drama,
``Cradle Will Rock,'' as a composer's muse. And toward the end of
the year she'll be starring in Michael John LaChiusa's new musical,
``Marie Christine,'' to be staged at Lincoln Center.
 &HT;    It's no accident that McDonald's next Broadway musical, like her
last, is an original work. She's a great supporter of the new
generation of musical-theater creators, excited by her conviction
that ``dramatic intent is now driving the compositional piece _
lines are being erased, borders are being erased.''
 &HT;    She admits that her advocacy is at root ``a selfish thing. I
want new and exciting projects out there for me, as well as for
everyone else. So it's an investment in my future as well as
theirs, as well as in the future of musical theater.''
 &HT;    Still, she says, she welcomes film and television opportunities
such as ``Having Our Say,'' chances to expose herself to new ideas
and new audiences.
 &HT;    ``It's good to challenge yourself,'' she says. ``As Bessie and
Sadie certainly would say, `Don't be afraid of anything new!'''

 Includes a color slide of Angelina Jolie with Billy Bob Thornton in
a scene from ``Pushing Tin.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Even the hottest young actress in Hollywood knows when it's time
to cool off.
 &HT;    After winning a Golden Globe Award for her role in the
television movie ``Gia,'' Angelina Jolie pushed past the press
waiting outside, kicked off her heels and dove into the
Olympic-sized pool at the Beverly Hills Hotel.
 &HT;    Never mind her Randolph Duke dress with its 5,000
antique-crystal beads. Never mind her carefully coifed hairdo or
the Harry Winston baubles that surely weren't meant for moonlight
dips.
 &HT;    ``It surprised me that no one else jumped in the pool with me,''
the 23-year-old Jolie says. ``Here I am, at an event with the
wildest actors in the business, and everyone was so tame and
serious. My question is, `Why wouldn't you want to jump into a
pool?'''
 &HT;    If you think that's unusual, try this: After her award-winning
turn in ``Gia,'' she actually contemplated quitting show business,
just as her agent's phone was starting to ring.
 &HT;    ``I was at a place in my life where I had everything I thought
you should have to make you happy,'' she recalls, ``and I felt
emptier than ever. I thought after `Gia' that I had given
everything I had to offer, and I didn't find myself growing.
 &HT;    ``I didn't have the strength to deal with Hollywood,'' she says
over breakfast at the Ritz Carlton in Pasadena, Calif. The lips
that have been described as being ``the size of sectional sofas''
curve in a frown.
 &HT;    ``I just needed to get away and find myself,'' she concludes.
 &HT;    Finding herself, in this case, meant going back to school for
some film classes.
 &HT;    ``It was at that point I realized how lucky I was to be on a
film set,'' she says. ``I suddenly appreciated my career, and I
started opening up again to Hollywood. I started to feel like the
fans I suddenly had weren't threatening to my life, but through my
work they were letting me in their life.''
 &HT;    A lot more people will be doing that after the April 23 release
of ``Pushing Tin,'' in which Jolie plays the knockout wife of a
macho, risk-taking air-traffic controller (Billy Bob Thornton).
Depressed, she winds up having an affair with another controller
(John Cusack), who happens to be her husband's main rival.
 &HT;    And, yes, going behind the scenes in the frenzied world of
air-traffic control made her a little nervous.
 &HT;    ``I had to keep reminding myself, `You're not going to die on a
plane. There is just no way,'' the actress says. ``In fact, I'm the
one who asks for the exit rows, because I want to be the one who
gets everyone out.
 &HT;    ``I'm not scared of much,'' she adds, ``because I really do live
by the creed that I might die tomorrow. In fact, I'm surprised I'm
still here. Honestly, I'm the kind of person who always could feel
the clock ticking.''
 &HT;    These are troubled times for Jolie, who is recently divorced
from ``Trainspotting'' star Jonny Lee Miller.
 &HT;    ``We're great friends, and I love him to death,'' she says.
``We've been going through this breakup so slowly because we want
each other to have all that we need in life right now.''
 &HT;    Her voice lowers.
 &HT;    ``Right now we need to do things separately, but it's all done
from love,'' she says. ``We're both holding each other's hand
through this, and it's been amazing _ the divorce has actually
brought us closer. I still consider him my husband.''
 &HT;    The other man in her life is, of course, her father,
Oscar-winning actor Jon Voight. In fact, it was in one of his
movies _ ``Looking to Get Out'' (1982) _ that the 6-year-old Jolie
made her screen debut.
 &HT;    ``I don't have many memories,'' she says. ``I basically remember
being in a hotel room with my brother and dancing on the bed
because we were so bored.''
 &HT;    Jolie's mother, actress Marcheline Bertrand, divorced her father
when she was an infant. Jolie lived with her, but spent weekends
with her father.
 &HT;    ``I would stage readings of plays in my living room,'' Voight
recalls in a separate interview. ``I remember, when Angie was 16,
she would stun us with powerful performances.''
 &HT;    Smitten, the young woman trained at the Lee Strasberg Theatre
Institute and then hit Hollywood. Early roles in ``Hackers'' (1995)
and ``Foxfire'' (1996) led to a role as the wife of the title
character in the cable movie ``George Wallace'' (1997). More
recently she was seen in ``Playing By Heart'' (1999), and she also
appeared in the Rolling Stones video, ``Has Anybody Seen My Baby?''
 &HT;    She shakes her head at the memory.
 &HT;    ``I didn't know what the Rolling Stones wanted,'' she says.
``Imagine my surprise when they wanted me to walk down the streets
in basically my underwear.
 &HT;    ``The great thing is that it was New York,'' she adds, ``and no
one cared. People in restaurants were like, `Oh, there goes the
girl from ``Gia'' in her drawers.'''
 &HT;    Next up is ``The Bone Collector,'' in which she plays a cop
teamed with a paraplegic officer (Denzel Washington) in an effort
to solve a string of murders.
 &HT;    She's currently filming ``Girl Interrupted,'' set in a 1960s
women's mental institution and co-starring Winona Ryder.
 &HT;    ``I've actually spent the last week strapped to a bed, which ...
'' Jolie begins, then laughs. ``There is something so strange and
kinky to all this stuff. And awful _ I spent a week in solitary
with a straitjacket on, too.
 &HT;    ``I have to make light of this film, because it's pretty heavy
stuff,'' she says more seriously. ``It's set in the '60s, when
girls were sent to a mental hospital because they were gay. Women
got shock treatments and they didn't remember their family a week
later.''
 &HT;    As her three high-profile roles suggest, Jolie is in the process
of moving from the ``promising'' category to the ``star'' category.
It's a process that she admits she still can't quite comprehend.
 &HT;    ``It's so weird,'' she says. ``Let's take `The Bone Collector.'
I've seen the poster, which is me with a gun and a walkie-talkie.
In my mind, I look like I'm 5, playing dress-up.''
 &HT;    Less easy to accept is the media attention that comes with
stardom. She and her father posed for a portrait in a recent issue
of Vanity Fair, which Jolie is seeing for the first time. She flips
to the picture, and then scowls.
 &HT;    ``Oh, this is hysterical,'' she says tightly, reading the
caption aloud with an edge to her voice. ```Angelina, a bad girl,
wears death tattoos and rubber clothes and likes to play with
knives. Some of this seems to have rubbed off on her old man.'''
 &HT;    Jolie fumes.
 &HT;    ``OK,'' she says grimly, ``I think I need to make some phone
calls when this interview is over.''
 &HT;    A few sips of orange juice later, she calms down.
 &HT;    ``I don't really take any of this stuff seriously,'' she says.
``I mean, how hot can I be? I'm really this goofy little odd
person, and someday the rest of the world will discover it. They'll
find out that the girl in those evening dresses is really a
complete idiot who spills coffee on herself and broke the phone by
falling over it this morning.
 &HT;    ``I'm one of the flawed people,'' she concludes. ``I just hide
it well.''

EXISTENZIALIST: JENNIFER JASON LEIGH TAKES ANOTHER WALK ON THE WILD
SIDE

entertainment package.)

 Includes a color slide of Jennifer Jason Leigh with Jude Law in a
scene from ``Existenz.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Jennifer Jason Leigh has spent the last decade or two playing
square pegs in round holes.
 &HT;    Her latest film, ``Existenz,'' casts her as another misfit, a
superstar virtual-reality-game designer on the lam after an
assassination attempt. It's not hard to see in the awkward,
antisocial Allegra Geller something of Leigh herself, a private and
enigmatic actress who has been called a reluctant star.
 &HT;    The comparisons are not lost on Leigh.
 &HT;    ``I liked seeing a bit of myself in Allegra,'' she says. ``I
liked the idea of playing someone who's very shy and uncomfortable
with people _ I certainly understood that.
 &HT;    ``Allegra is really, really uncomfortable with people,'' Leigh
adds. ```The hell with people' is her motto. It's something I've
sort of said for years, too, but Allegra practically wears it.
 &HT;    ``It's almost pathological how shy she is,'' she says, ``which
is partly because of the work she does. She doesn't have to deal
with people. It's only in the game-testing phase that she has to
face the press, and it's very painful for her.
 &HT;    ``And you know what? It is for me, too. I'm not comfortable. I
love to work, but I don't like to talk about my work or myself that
much, and it doesn't come easy to me.''
 &HT;    Leigh, the 37-year-old daughter of writer/producer Barbara
Turner and the late actor Vic Morrow, laughs.
 &HT;    ``I'm not quite as shy as Allegra,'' she says, ``but I'm
close.''
 &HT;    Written and directed by David Cronenberg, ``Existenz'' _ or, as
the promotions would have it, ``eXistenZ'' _ opens on April 23.
It's a futuristic drama that finds Geller in hiding, accompanied
only by unarmed security guard Ted Pikul (Jude Law), as she tries
to sort out the complications of her new game, eXistenZ, which
thrusts them _ and moviegoers _ into a bizarre universe that blurs
the lines between fantasy and reality.
 &HT;    ``For me, the film is about the desire to escape,'' Leigh says
by telephone from her home in Los Angeles. ``It's very funny and
it's also an existential film, in that you create your reality
moment by moment.
 &HT;    ``I love that the film works on so many levels,'' she says.
``Even playing the scenes, from take to take, there were different
choices to make all the time.
 &HT;    ``It was challenging and exciting to keep track of the levels,
but I wouldn't say it was hard,'' she concludes. ``Jude and I would
just look at each other and say, `Let's do it this way or that
way.'''
 &HT;    Working with Cronenberg was a unique experience, the actress
says.
 &HT;    ``We weren't allowed to change the dialogue, but we could
interpret it any old way,'' she says. ``He enjoys that. David is
lovely to work with, incredibly intelligent, very easygoing and
funny.''
 &HT;    Actors who work with Cronenberg tend to come away saying that
it's hard to believe that so normal a guy could have directed such
out-there brainbenders as ``Scanners'' (1981), ``Videodrome''
(1982), ``Dead Ringers'' (1988) and ``Crash'' (1997).
 &HT;    ``That's true, but it's often the case,'' Leigh says, laughing.
``A lot of directors you meet, who are the healthiest people, make
the strangest films.
 &HT;    ``The reverse is probably true, too,'' she adds, ``but I haven't
worked with a lot of those directors in my career!''
 &HT;    Which isn't hard to believe. Leigh is the actor equivalent of
Cronenberg, a veteran who does her own thing, generally outside the
mainstream. Her credits include ``Fast Times at Ridgemont High''
(1982), ``Last Exit to Brooklyn'' (1989), ``Backdraft'' (1991),
``Single White Female'' (1992), ``Short Cuts'' (1993), ``Dolores
Claiborne'' (1995), ``Georgia'' (1995) and ``Washington Square''
(1997).
 &HT;    There are few box-office smashes and barely a normal character
in the bunch, and Leigh wouldn't have it any other way.
 &HT;    ``If I can keep working without doing too much in the mainstream
that would be great,'' Leigh says. ``Luckily, I've been able to
earn my living doing the films I like, and I haven't had to do
mainstream films too often.
 &HT;    ``You really don't pick what's going to be commercial and what's
not,'' she adds. ``Nobody ever knows that. Honestly, I don't think
you can know that.
 &HT;    ``A lot of films people think will be hugely commercial bomb,''
Leigh says, ``and sometimes a movie that wasn't intended to be a
huge commercial thing hits for some reason. If people had a formula
that really worked, they'd use it more often.''
 &HT;    As for her own movies, she denies any interest in the commercial
end of her work.
 &HT;    ``A lot of the big commercial hits I don't like,'' she says. ``I
liked `Single White Female,' but didn't go into it thinking or
knowing it would be a commercial success.''
 &HT;    Fair enough, but Leigh had to know that its chances for a
lucrative box-office run far exceeded those of, say, ``Georgia,''
which she co-produced.
 &HT;    ``Maybe I did, but that's not why I choose my roles,'' she says.
```Single White Female' did have a better chance _ but, again, that
didn't mean it would be successful.
 &HT;    ``From my point of view, just because they put millions and
millions of dollars into advertising doesn't mean the movies will
make a lot of money,'' Leigh says. ``I'd rather do the films I
like.''
 &HT;    Which means joining forces with directors as willing to take
risks as she. Leigh has worked with most of today's most critically
acclaimed mavericks, including Cronenberg, Robert Altman, the Coen
brothers and Stanley Kubrick.
 &HT;    ``They're all hugely talented and they make their own movies,''
Leigh says. ``They don't make movies by committee. That's what
they've got in common.
 &HT;    ``Their movies set them apart,'' she says. ``Their visions,
ideas and stories set them apart. They're very different
filmmakers, but they're all really fantastic.''
 &HT;    If a Kubrick film featuring Leigh doesn't spring instantly to
mind, there's a reason. Leigh's scenes in Kubrick's swan song,
``Eyes Wide Shut,'' were cut after the actress couldn't return to
the set in London for additional filming.
 &HT;    ``He was brilliant, a total mensch,'' she says. ``I don't know
if he was as obsessive as everybody says he was. I didn't find him
obsessive in a horrible way _ I just found him to be incredibly
detailed and lovely.''
 &HT;    Never one to duck a challenge, Leigh recently took to the stage
in the Broadway revival of the musical ``Cabaret.'' She spent
several months starring as Sally Bowles in the production, to
reviews that generally praised her acting and panned her singing.
 &HT;    ``It was so much fun to do,'' she says. ``The cast was amazing,
and it was an incredible show to go into. Everybody was very
welcoming to me.
 &HT;    ``How fun it was to sing and dance on Broadway. It was insane.''
 &HT;    Speaking of insane, Leigh's next project, ``Beautiful View,''
casts her as a chambermaid obsessed with a guest at the hotel where
she's employed. The film will be directed by her mother, who penned
the script for Leigh.
 &HT;    As the interview comes to an end, Leigh contemplates what she
knows now about her craft that she didn't nearly 20 years ago, when
she made her acting debut in the television movie, ``The Best
Little Girl in the World'' (1981).
 &HT;    ``I think you learn from everyone you meet and everything you
do,'' she says. ``You learn something from every life experience.
Hopefully, you just get deeper and better.
 &HT;    ``I guess I just know more now,'' she says. ``I'm older. I've
lived more. I don't know that I've changed my approach, though, or
that I ever will.''

MATT GROENING: THE `FUTURAMA' IS NOW

 Includes a 200-word sidebar and a color slide of a scene from the
animated television series, ``Futurama.'' 
 By DAVID KRONKE  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The future isn't what it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, our future was usually seen as a fairly grim place,
depicted in such cautionary classics as ``1984'' (1956) _ which now
represents a future which is history, but that's another story _
``A Clockwork Orange'' (1971) or ``Blade Runner'' (1982).
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to the brave new world of ``Futurama,'' the new
animated series from ``The Simpsons'' mastermind Matt Groening and
co-creator David Cohen, the future is simply, well, silly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with science fiction is, if you posit a future as
a wonderful place, you're saying, `It doesn't matter how you do
things now, look how things turn out,''' Groening says. ``And if
you make it a dystopian future, you're saying, `It doesn't matter
what you do now, look how things turn out.' Our decision was to
make both good stuff and bad stuff, to play it both ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence ``Futurama,'' in which a 20th-century slacker named Fry is
frozen in a cryogenic pod for a millennium, then thaws out on an
Earth far different from the one which he left. His only friends
are Bender, a cranky robot, and Leela, a purple-haired cyclops and
apparently the only entity in the 30th century with a lick of
sense.
</P>
<P>
   And if they somewhat remind you of a dysfunctional 20th-century
family, maybe even a specific, animated one that inhabits the Fox
prime-time lineup, well ...
</P>
<P>
   ``There are definite similarities _ they both have big eyeballs
and no chins,'' Groening admits. ``That's just what you get out of
my pen. Look, it's basically Springfield, in that Springfield is a
mix of the wonderful and the horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Groening promises a whole new take on television science fiction
in ``Futurama.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the great things is, we have none of the limitations of
live action,'' the cartoonist says. ``In live action, the
characters are always looking out of portholes, and they beam down
onto what looks like a Hollywood back lot. I guarantee you won't
see any episodes set in the old West, nor with 1920s gangsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can draw anything we want,'' he says cheerfully. ``We don't
have to beam down _ we can actually land. Because of the sci-fi
backdrop, and because we're having fun with some of the epic
grandeur of sci-fi, it has a richer look.''
</P>
<P>
   For that, Groening credits the animation studio Rough Draft,
which he first encountered when it created some
``Simpsons''-related commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do a fantastic job,'' he says. ``I took my son over there
for the first time last weekend. He was amazed to meet grown men
who play with toys! He was really happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Claudia Katz, who is the Rough Draft producer for ``Futurama,''
shares Groening's ambitions for the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all the episodes we've done, we've never gone to the same
place twice, which is both a blessing and a curse,'' she says.
``Basically, every week we're designing a whole new Springfield.
But it lets our designers strut their stuff and show off. Sometimes
the writers will just put in their scripts, `Designers _ knock
yourselves out.'''
</P>
<P>
   Together, Groening and Rough Draft have created what Katz calls
``a low-tech high-tech look, sort of how the future was supposed to
look back in the '40s and '50s.'' Future episodes include a visit
to a planet with three suns, a trek to a planet of virulent,
human-loathing robots and, yes, a space-bound ``Titanic'' parody.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're able to write gags for robots,'' Groening says, ``which
are great because they're characters who feel no guilt.''
</P>
<P>
   Groening is the first to admit that he only provides the
framework for large writing staffs who create the scripts for his
shows. He can't even calculate how many different writers have
worked on the last decade of ``The Simpsons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my God,'' he says, ``I never thought of that. It must be
... I have no idea. Over 60.''
</P>
<P>
   The same perfectionism that wore out those dozens of writers
also challenges his animators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt's always impressive, but that can be frustrating,'' Katz
says. ``He can walk in and make a change _ it's always a great
change, he has a great eye _ but we had just spent a month working
on what he changed.''
</P>
<P>
   When ``The Simpsons'' hit the air a decade ago, it was the only
prime-time animated series. Today prime-time animation is rampant _
nearly a half-dozen new series have been scheduled or announced by
networks since January. Groening's crucial insight _ that cartoons
didn't have to be exclusively for children _ has ironically
produced a flock of competitors for the crown of ``The Simpsons,''
competitors that might also damage ``Futurama's'' chances.
</P>
<P>
   But he claims he doesn't mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm such a fan of animation,'' he says. ``I love seeing a
great piece of animation. Animation in the '90s doesn't look like
everything else _ people do their own unique vision, and that I
find refreshing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to come up with innovations in live-action
sitcoms,'' he adds. ``It's pretty much been the same thing for 50
years. I'm sick of that too, but now `The PJs' looks like nothing
else. And `King of the Hill' has created its own observational
humor. I love them, and can't wait to see the others.''
</P>
<P>
   Groening offers up the ironic punch line to his success as an
animation mogul: When he first picked up a pen and doodled _ on
childhood sketches that eventually evolved into the comic strip
``Life In Hell,'' which he still draws today _ no one foresaw a
lucrative future.
</P>
<P>
   ``My secret shame is when I was a kid, I drew bunny rabbits a
lot, and it didn't impress anyone,'' he says with a laugh. ``People
would say, `Oh, look, a bunny rabbit!' And I'd say, `No, it's a
serious rabbit, not a bunny rabbit.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But now, looking at it, I have to admit they were right. They
are bunny rabbits.'' &QL; 
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; SIDEBAR: IN THE FUTURE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The more things change, the more they stay the same _ ludicrous,
that is. It's particularly so in ``Futurama.'' Here's the way
creator Matt Groening sees things 1,000 years from now:
</P>
<P>
   + ``The Simpsons'' is still on the air, but people complain that
the first 500 years were better than the second 500.
</P>
<P>
   They have a point, Groening admits: ``There were too many clip
shows in the second 500 years. There were 130 years of clip
shows.''
</P>
<P>
   + The Internet still exists, ``and it's still too slow.''
</P>
<P>
   + Celebrated 20th-century figures, including Groening himself,
still exist, but as heads in jars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It beats the alternative,'' Groening says with a shrug. ``I
have mixed feelings about being a head in a jar.''
</P>
<P>
   + Most shockingly, the television-network situation has reversed
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Three are gone _ Fox has emerged triumphant,''
Groening reports.
</P>
<P>
   He had also declared that UPN would still be around _ and still
be dead last in the ratings _ but he's since backed off.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an easy joke, like a joke on Jay Leno,'' he says. ``I'm
not proud of that. I've been writing TV long enough to construct
bad jokes.''

 AUDRA McDONALD IS HAVING HER SAY  
 (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.)

 Includes a color slide of Audra McDonald with Lisa Arrindell
Anderson in a scene from ``Having Our Say.'' 
 By MICHAEL J. BANDLER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Call Audra McDonald the entertainment industry's stealth weapon.
 &HT;    The most celebrated musical-theater actress of her generation _
at 28, she already has three Tony Awards _ she's also won a growing
number of fans as a recording artist. But despite the hurrahs of
those who saw her on Broadway last year in ``Ragtime,'' she's still
an unfamiliar name to audiences outside New York.
 &HT;    For now, anyway. Her breakthrough just might be the television
movie ``Having Our Say,'' which will air April 18 on CBS. Adapted
from Emily Mann's acclaimed stage play _ based on the 1993
bestseller of the same name _ ``Having Our Say'' is the true story
of more than 100 years of African-American history as seen through
the eyes of two sisters, Sarah ``Sadie'' and A. Elizabeth
``Bessie'' Delany.
 &HT;    They saw black America from the Jim Crow era through the 1990s,
and from Raleigh, N.C. _ where the sisters were born as the
children of an Episcopal bishop _ to 1910s New York, where they
attended Columbia University and went on to careers of their own,
Sadie as a schoolteacher and Bessie as a dentist. Bessie Delany
died in 1995 at 104, her sister in 1999 at 109.
 &HT;    McDonald plays the feisty Bessie during her prime, with Lisa
Arrindell Anderson playing Sadie. Ruby Dee and Diahann Carroll play
the sisters as old women.
 &HT;    The first time she read the Delanys' memoir, the actress says,
her first reaction was, ``I have nothing to complain about _
absolutely nothing! And shame on me if I do. Because I have 95
billion percent more chance of getting anywhere I want to be than
these women did and, in my opinion, they far surpassed anything
I've already done _ especially considering the odds they had to
work against.''
 &HT;    The sisters have something important to say to black Americans,
she adds.
 &HT;    ``There's a lot of bitterness and anger within certain aspects
of the black community today that's residual from years past,'' she
says. ``The Delany sisters talk a lot about how you can't hold
bitterness in your heart _ it will ruin your life.''
 &HT;    McDonald grew up in a family not unlike the Delanys, with roots
in rural Virginia and a bedrock commitment to education as the road
to success.
 &HT;    ``Some of the things their father was telling them I have heard
firsthand from my parents, obviously parroting things they heard
from their parents,'' she says. ``They talked about the importance
of a college education, because no matter what happens in your
life, no one can ever take that away from you. You've got that
paper.
 &HT;    ``When I graduated from Juilliard and came home to Fresno,'' she
recalls, ``the first thing my dad said when I got off the plane
was, `Where's the diploma?' That was most important _ a real tool,
a weapon, to use in society for fighting racism.''
 &HT;    The actress comes from a musical family in which, as she puts
it, ``everybody's made some sort of noise with some sort of
instrument or with their throat.'' Her father was a college music
major, her mother was a piano teacher with a master's degree in
music and her aunts and mother even formed a gospel group, the
McDonald Sisters, some years back.
 &HT;    Young Audra, who had been performing in community theater since
she was 9, burst onto the Broadway scene in 1994, fresh out of
Manhattan's Juilliard School. As Carrie Pipperidge in the Lincoln
Center revival of ``Carousel,'' she won her first Tony Award. The
next year she won another for her bristling performance in ``The
Master Class,'' as a budding opera singer being coached by Zoe
Caldwell's Maria Callas. She won her third in 1998 for her
performance as the tragic Sarah in ``Ragtime.''
 &HT;    Her characters are typically passionate women who teeter on the
edge between achievement and disaster. It's an edge which McDonald
knows well since her Juilliard days.
 &HT;    At the prestigious performing-arts school, the singing program
traditionally inclines toward opera. Though blessed with an
awesomely rich operatic voice, McDonald was already enthralled by
the Broadway stage. She spent her first few months at Juilliard
fighting what she calls ``the operatic thing.'' That struggle,
combined with a couple of personal relationships that ``spiraled
downward,'' resulted in a brief breakdown, what she calls a
``mental vacation.''
 &HT;    Fellow students, her parents and therapy helped McDonald through
her crisis, reinforcing her faith in her own sense of her destiny.
Once secure in that, McDonald says, she decided that Juilliard
``should become my friend.''
 &HT;    The rest, as they say, is history.
 &HT;    That experience helped her re-enact a crucial juncture in Bessie
Delany's life. In 1913, en route to a teaching position in Georgia,
she and two other black teachers from New York were sitting in the
``colored'' waiting room of a train station in Waycross, Ga., when
a drunken white man approached and began harassing them.
 &HT;    As he screamed invectives, Bessie's colleagues fled, and a crowd
began to form on the platform. But she continued to sit on the
bench, combing her hair until the train finally came to whisk her
away.
 &HT;    ``I think that's when she realizes how special she is,'' the
actress says, ``that she can take care of herself and is worthy of
that which she seeks and that which she stands for. That's when she
finally cuts her teeth as Bessie.
 &HT;    ``Till her dying day, she was still riled up about that,''
McDonald adds. ``She'd say, `You know, I don't take tea for fever,'
which I take to mean, `Nothing's going to calm me down. If I'm this
angry about something, nothing will be a salve for me. Once I'm
angry, I'm gone!'''
 &HT;    ``Having Our Say'' was McDonald's first experience acting for a
camera instead of an audience, and she admits that she found it
awkward at first.
 &HT;    ``I would much rather get up in front of 100,000 people I don't
know and sing and dance,'' she says. ``For a while, I was very
afraid of the camera. I was like, `Get that thing away from me! Why
is it looking at me?'
 &HT;    ``But then Lynne Littman, the director, told me, `It's like a
member of the audience, and you can't hide from it.' Once she made
that correlation I started to calm down, and it made all the
difference in the world.''
 &HT;    Don't look for McDonald to go Hollywood, though. This summer
she'll be back on the concert stage, appearing at the Tanglewood
Music Festival and elsewhere on tour. She'll also be singing on
film, appearing briefly in Tim Robbins' 1930s political drama,
``Cradle Will Rock,'' as a composer's muse. And toward the end of
the year she'll be starring in Michael John LaChiusa's new musical,
``Marie Christine,'' to be staged at Lincoln Center.
 &HT;    It's no accident that McDonald's next Broadway musical, like her
last, is an original work. She's a great supporter of the new
generation of musical-theater creators, excited by her conviction
that ``dramatic intent is now driving the compositional piece _
lines are being erased, borders are being erased.''
 &HT;    She admits that her advocacy is at root ``a selfish thing. I
want new and exciting projects out there for me, as well as for
everyone else. So it's an investment in my future as well as
theirs, as well as in the future of musical theater.''
 &HT;    Still, she says, she welcomes film and television opportunities
such as ``Having Our Say,'' chances to expose herself to new ideas
and new audiences.
 &HT;    ``It's good to challenge yourself,'' she says. ``As Bessie and
Sadie certainly would say, `Don't be afraid of anything new!'''

BABY BOOMERS: WITHER OR NOT?

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I just received another offer for a newsletter
on aging. It promises that if (and only if) I subscribe, I will
look better, feel better, enjoy life more and generally be the
terrific person they think I should be.
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with who I am now? Apparently, everything.
</P>
<P>
   Today, if you're not worried about being thin, keeping in shape,
removing wrinkles and eating phytofoods, you're obviously not a
human living on this planet.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the Y2K problem _ we're talking real life here. As a
member of the Baby Boomer generation, I am well aware that it is
easier to find products and businesses devoted to de-aging than it
is to locate a reliable neighborhood shoe repair shop. Or
drugstore. Or bookstore. Or bakery.
</P>
<P>
   Every time some local mom and pop store has the rent raised and
is pushed out of business, you can be sure what will come in will
be some ``shoppe'' devoted to herbals, nail care, beauty products,
exercise equipment or tummy tucks.
</P>
<P>
   Every clothing catalog features wildly make-upped, pre-pubescent
female persons frolicking around in what are purported to be
``women's'' sizes.
</P>
<P>
   Every product (whether cosmetics or bathroom detergents) is
promoted showing young, long-haired women in short skirts lazily
smiling as they ardently fondle a bottle or canister, exuding a
message directly for you: ``You would be young, you would be
beautiful, you would be sexy if only you'd use Blabbo Toiletbowl
Cleaner like I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Look around and see how many spokespeople on TV have a few gray
hairs or a few extra pounds. On the surface, it seems like we're
becoming a nation of perpetual children.
</P>
<P>
   At playground soccer games, take a look at the moms and dads.
</P>
<P>
   They're wearing the same clothes as their kids, jumping up and
down like maniacs, just like their kids, trying to live the same
life as their kids.
</P>
<P>
   Their days are crammed full of a wide assortment of activities
and playdates. At night they must be out at the latest movie or
antioxidant lecture to make sure they're up on what's really going
on.
</P>
<P>
   Admitting to being tired is never permitted. It's synonymous
with being over the hill. Plastic surgery has never been more
popular. At parties people make parlor games out of guessing who
had what done.
</P>
<P>
   Surgeons now ``sign'' their work with a characteristic upturned
nose or jowl (``Why, I see you have the Greenberg Jaw. How
delightful!'')
</P>
<P>
   Taking a quick look around in a crowd, you would swear there was
no one over 30 still in existence. A woman I know, with a daughter
in her early 20s, delights in people telling her how much she and
her girl look like sisters.
</P>
<P>
   If someone says she looks like her daughter's mother, she makes
a rude remark or tries to smack them in the face. So what ever
happened to sweetly smiling gray-haired ladies, like those in other
cultures, who are beloved and deeply revered for their years of
experience and wisdom?
</P>
<P>
   Do they still exist? Or do we have to rent films from the '30s
and '40s, featuring frankly ``old'' female stars like Jane Darwell,
Margaret Rutherford or Beulah Bondi to understand what it was like
to enjoy living in your own (untucked) skin? I realize that I'm
beginning to sound like a curmudgeon here.
</P>
<P>
   But, I consider it practice for how I'll be, I hope, in about 30
years. Meanwhile, I have seven vitamins I have to take before my
power walk. Or maybe I'll just take a nap.

THE SABBATHDAY RIVER 
By Jean Hanff Korelitz 
Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux. 499 pp. $25. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most conventions of popular fiction play to our fantasies while
sheltering our unconscious assumptions: The courtroom thriller uses
a mahogany-trimmed sanctuary in which to unearth its ghastly
crimes; the contemporary romance novel, nodding to the realities of
broken families and transient love, nonetheless promises an inner
life, or at least a willing heart. The domestic drama, steeped as
it is in the comforts and confines of home, particularly relies
upon this covenant of wishful desire and grimmer truth _ insisting
that the hearth be warm and made of brick, even if it's being
smashed to smithereens.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Hanff Korelitz's yeasty drama has elements of each of these
genres, and it follows a recent spate of similar novels, among them
Jacquelyn Mitchard's ``The Deep End of the Ocean,'' Jane Hamilton's
``The Home at the End of the World,'' and Sue Miller's ``While I
Was Gone.'' What these works share is not just dark trouble wrapped
within the cloak of friends and family, but the narrative
perspective of an introspective female character. This viewpoint
bestows the story with a close-focus intimacy that can be both
revealing and claustrophobic. If we've witnessed by the end of the
novel the unraveling of a web of secrets, we also know how
everybody takes his or her coffee and, heaven help us, why.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, ``The Sabbathday River'' has received advance
notice as a ``feminine thriller,'' which is a terrible thing to
call a book, but will no doubt become the shorthand term to promote
it. The novel is actually a morality tale set in the twilight
ambience of small-town New Hampshire, with an adulterous young
woman named Heather Pratt at its center. Much like Hawthorne's
sacrificial Hester Prynne, Korelitz's character becomes a scapegoat
for the rages and fears of a tight-lipped (and tightly wrapped)
community. Most of the thematic parallels to ``The Scarlet Letter''
end there, though Heather's libidinous downfall is at the hands of
a sleazeball with a ponytail named Ashley Deacon. Not even Arthur
Dimmesdale, he.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sabbathday River'' opens in 1985 with the horrid discovery
of a dead infant outside Goddard, N.H., near the jogging path where
Naomi Roth runs. A 35-year-old transplanted New Yorker who has made
a grudging peace with Goddard in her nine years there, Naomi is the
alienated conscience of the novel _ the Jewish outsider whose
hilltop point of view delivers the intersecting stories of the
entire town. Having come to Goddard as a VISTA volunteer with her
piously radical husband, Naomi is now recently divorced and trying
to make her life work. She runs a local crafts cooperative,
Flourish, formed when she convinced the women of Goddard to market
their wares. In the year since her husband, Daniel, high-tailed it
to a commune in Woodstock, she has sheetrocked their A-frame and
made it a home instead of a political statement. And on that sunny
September morning that will change her life, she has found a baby,
lying like a broken doll in the Sabbathday River.
</P>
<P>
   When Naomi panics and takes the child's body to the sheriff's
office, she's initially treated with suspicion for having removed
the corpse from a crime scene. But within hours, the investigation
_ targeted to include any woman in Goddard considered deviant _
ends at the house of Heather Pratt, a sweet, insecure 20-year-old
who lives with her 14-month-old daughter, Polly. Heather has turned
out to be the embarrassment of the town: Dropping out of Dartmouth
after only a few weeks, she returned to Goddard a couple of years
ago and took up publicly with Ashley Deacon, a married handyman who
lists his virility as one of his many skills. Undaunted by the fact
of his pregnant wife, Heather spent several blissful months
steaming up the rear windows of Ashley's car; her own pregnancy,
with Polly, was blindly joyful, and she couldn't understand, or
didn't care, why the townfolk treated her with such disdain. That
scorn was minor compared with Ashley's inevitable rejection, after
which she retreated to her life with Polly and the samplers she
embroiders for Naomi's craft business.
</P>
<P>
   Or did, until this day of the Sabbathday River discovery, when
Heather is ripped away from her daughter and subjected to a
grueling, probably illegal interrogation. Sick with worry and
fatigue, she confesses _ or admits, at least, that she had a
stillborn baby a few days ago, which in her distress and confusion
she left in a pond at the bottom of her property. So we now have
one alleged murderess and possibly two dead infants, as well as a
zealous prosecutor, a bevy of competing medical experts, and an
entire town on the warpath. Not to mention the potential for
several subplots: Caring for Polly while Heather is in jail, Naomi
has to wrestle with her misplaced maternal longings. Judith
Friedman, another displaced New Yorker whom Naomi has just
befriended, is the new public defender in charge of Heather's case
_ when she's not disappearing into mysterious troubles out of town.
And several locals, from the sanctimonious to the scurrilous, have
their own inscrutable agendas; by the end of the trial, which is
woven through the last half of the novel, all of them will have had
their day in court.
</P>
<P>
   Haunting in its painful rendition of the worst kind of death,
purplish in its swollen recitation of Heather's unbridled
sexuality, ``The Sabbathday River'' continually lurches between
melodrama and the tragedy at its center. It has the riveting
components of a good courtroom drama, enhanced by some finely
etched characters (with his nonchalant narcissism, Ashley is
splendidly awful). But some of the moral points of the novel _ that
sensuality is condemned, even criminalized, for instance _ are
driven home with the delicacy of a nail gun. We are afforded very
few gray areas: Most of the residents of Goddard are conservative,
hypocritical, and Christian; their challengers are Jewish, liberal,
and fast-talking urban. Naomi's briefly reappearing ex-husband,
whose name-dropping leftism does, granted, beg caricature, is
nonetheless no greater than the sum of his own cliches. These
stereotypes obscure their characters rather than illuminating them,
and thereby diminish the complexity of sorrow at the novel's core.
</P>
<P>
   Which is, from beginning to end, the retelling of a very old
story: one about the love between parent and child, the sacrifices
made either against or in the name of God, the quest for faith in
an uncertain world. If these themes are articulated unevenly in
``The Sabbathday River,'' Korelitz has managed to make their final
resolution commendably shadowy. There are no victors at the end of
Heather Pratt's trial by fire, unless wisdom itself gets to take a
bow. There is instead the infinite memory of that bright September
day, when ``all the worst things,'' as Naomi remembers, lie
revealed in morning sun.

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ This really isn't the time to be thinking about
August. Spring break was just a few weeks ago, and most school kids
haven't even taken this year's TAAS tests yet.
</P>
<P>
   But next year's school calendar for the Austin Independent
School District is already out, and there it is, as big as life and
very aggravating, an Aug. 11 start date for the ``fall'' semester.
</P>
<P>
   AISD isn't alone. Most districts across the state apparently now
start classes in mid- or early August _ at the hottest time of the
year in Texas and during weeks that many Texas families once
considered prime vacation time.

   Maybe there ought to be a law against the continued erosion of
summer, but there won't be. Not during this legislative session,
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   For the second session in a row, Sen. Eddie Lucio Jr.,
D-Brownsville, has been thwarted in his efforts to require school
districts to return to what used to be considered tradition and
wait until Sept. 1 or later to start school.
</P>
<P>
   Lucio, however, is optimistic that this year he can at least
force an objective, in-depth look at the issue. His amended bill,
to require a study by the state education commissioner, has won
easy Senate approval, and Lucio predicted it will be endorsed by
the House as well.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, Senate Bill 40, would require the commissioner to
study the effects of a post-Sept. 1 start date on ``students,
parents, school personnel, school districts, local economies and
the state economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner would have to report his findings to the
Legislature early in the 2001 session.
</P>
<P>
   School districts started moving up their start dates several
years ago, partly because of additional teaching days ordered by
the Legislature to help strengthen the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   AISD spokesman Andy Welch said another reason is to complete the
first semester before the Christmas holidays. Scheduling, he said,
also is complicated by the need to set aside days for teacher
preparation and development and bad-weather contingencies.
</P>
<P>
   AISD provides 175 teaching days a year, five fewer than the 180
required by the state. The district obtained a waiver to allow it
to provide more days for staff development and parent-teacher
conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Classes will end this spring on May 25.
</P>
<P>
   Welch said the Austin district hasn't been bombarded with
complaints from parents. He believes most families are adjusting to
school in August.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas State Teachers Association officially backs Lucio's
efforts, but spokeswoman Annette Cootes said individual teachers
have different opinions about when the school year should start.
</P>
<P>
   The tourism division of the Texas Department of Economic
Development already has conducted a study of the early school start
and, not surprisingly, has concluded that it has hurt the Texas
tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
   Lucio's South Texas district, which includes the South Padre
Island playground, is heavily dependent on tourism. And the senator
acknowledged that tourism was one reason he wanted to keep schools
closed until after Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where the whole issue started last session. It was
considered a greedy bill,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, tourism businesspeople aren't the only ones
losing money when school bells start ringing in August. So are
thousands of Texas schoolchildren _ many from low-income families _
who have summer jobs at tourist facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Lucio said he also was concerned about the effects of the early
class start on the children of migrant workers. He said about
200,000 of those children, many of them in his district, attend
public schools in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   They have a high dropout rate, partly because many aren't able
to start school until late September, after they finish helping
their parents in the fields, and quickly fall behind their
classmates.
</P>
<P>
   Their plight is only worsened when classes start in August.
</P>
<P>
   These are among the concerns that the state education
commissioner should address if Lucio's bill passes. Other issues
include the extra cost to taxpayers of cooling school buildings at
the hottest time of the year, the effect on students of riding on
unairconditioned school buses in August and the effects of the
summer ``dog days'' on a child's ability to learn.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner also could take a look at the length of
schools' Christmas holidays and spring breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Many school board members and school superintendents may argue
that any attempt by the state to change their scheduling would
violate ``local control'' over the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   But local control may be a false issue here. If the state can
tell school districts how many days they must teach, which it
already does, it also can tell districts when to start teaching.

WOMEN REBUILD LIVES IN THE TRADES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) Marcie Cantu knew she would need to get a good-paying
job with health insurance to get off welfare.
</P>
<P>
   She used to be a secretary, but it didn't pay enough to support
her three young sons.
</P>
<P>
   So Cantu, a single mother, signed up for a program in Houston
that teaches women job skills so they can get high-paying positions
that traditionally have gone to men. Cantu plans to start working
in August as a $9-an-hour meter reader for the local power company.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare, Cantu, who got as far as the seventh grade, is
walking three miles a day to get up to the seven miles a day that
she'll have to walk on her new job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want a better job than flipping hamburgers,'' said Cantu,
who also is studying for a high school equivalency certificate.
</P>
<P>
   Out of a converted house in north Houston, Women Helping Women
is teaching displaced homemakers, battered women and welfare
recipients the necessary job skills to work in positions that
traditionally have gone to men.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 22 women have signed up for the 41-week program funded
by the Texas Workforce Commission. Women Helping Women can
accommodate 50 women and takes most of its referrals from women's
shelters and food pantries.
</P>
<P>
   The women recently completed a forklift course _ which included
how to drive, stop and back up _ and they will eventually build a
small structure to practice new construction skills that include
carpentry, electrical work, roofing and drywalling.
</P>
<P>
   The trades are really good for women, said Faye Turner, the
group's founder. In these fields, it doesn't matter if you've had
some hard knocks in your life. Or if you've made some mistakes. Or
if you have too many tattoos, Turner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They like tattoos,'' said Turner, with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, who had no job skills when she got married, learned sign
painting when her husband got sick and they faced foreclosure on
their house.
</P>
<P>
   For a variety of reasons, women have been shut out of many of
the higher-paying jobs that traditionally have gone to men, such as
construction and heavy manufacturing, even though they don't
require a lot of education or training.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, it's just tradition _ the job always has been done by
men. Other times, an employer believes women can't lift the loads
required. Or maybe believes a woman is too emotional for the job.
</P>
<P>
   When women don't have many skills, it's not so easy to break out
of that female wage ghetto. But for the ones who do, it can be a
way out of a life based on bare subsistence.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Shipes, for example, hopes to pick up the skills she'll
need to launch a construction engineering career.
</P>
<P>
   Shipes, a 21-year-old single mother with three children under
the age of 5, quit her job at Kmart recently and hopes she'll learn
enough to eventually end up with a $16- to $18-an-hour job.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Wissel, owner of Houston Flaglady, a provider of flag
holders who divert traffic around construction sites, has hired
several women from Women Helping Women. She pays $10 an hour and
for several women, the job has allowed them a way to escape their
violent husbands.
</P>
<P>
   While it's a good wage for casual work _ you don't work if it
rains _ workers can earn $500 a week. But the conditions aren't
easy _ it can be 130 to 140 degrees when asphalt is being laid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your ears burn, your nose burns,'' she said, wearing an orange
vest and holding her flag at a local construction site.
</P>
<P>
   The Pepsi-Cola Bottling Group in Houston has hired a dozen women
from the project for warehouse night loaders (they load cases onto
a pallet, secure the load and move it onto tractor-trailers at
night) and merchandisers (they stock grocery store shelves and
build in-store displays).
</P>
<P>
   It's very labor-intensive work that traditionally has been done
by men, said Freddie Franklin, human resources manager. But the
bottler decided to try to diversify its work force and expanded the
source of job applicants.
</P>
<P>
   The women are driven to succeed, Franklin said, adding that the
group's most efficient loader is a woman.
</P>
<P>
   And the jobs, which pay $9.61 an hour for the loaders and
between $8.35 and $14.85 for the merchandisers, come with a full
range of benefits, including medical, retirement, stock options and
fertility assistance.

FAITHFUL, EVEN IN DEATH

  (For release Sunday, April 18)

<TEXT>
<P>
   The greatest speech of the minus-first millennium was the Lord's
voice from the whirlwind in the Book of Job, the most extended
direct quotation of God in the Bible. The poet-rabbi who wrote it
used vivid word-pictures to mock the challenge to his fairness by
the unjustly afflicted Job. In a savagely sarcastic rhetorical
interrogation, he demanded, ``Where were you when I laid the
foundation of the earth ... while the morning stars sang together,
and all the gods exulted?''
</P>
<P>
   The first millennium began with its best speech: In the Sermon
on the Mount, as reported by St. Matthew, Jesus began with the
Beatitudes, a series of attention-riveting blessings, and opened a
world of metaphor for speakers to come, like ``Ye are the salt of
the earth ... the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill
cannot be hid.''
</P>
<P>
   The second millennium boasts a stirring address by Ireland's
Robert Emmet on the gallows. (``Let no man write my epitaph.'') The
American patriotic rouser rivaling Patrick Henry's ``Give me
liberty or give me death!'' was the grandiloquent and yet eloquent
Fourth of July speech that Rep. Daniel Webster suggested might have
been given by John Adams: ``Sink or swim, live or die, survive or
perish, I give my hand and my heart to this vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the millennium's end, Winston Churchill told an embattled
House of Commons, ``I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears
and sweat.'' FDR and JFK knew how to provide oratorical uplift, as
did the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., with ``I have a dream.'' The
best closing line was from Anatoly Shcharansky, who, after
addressing his dissidence to the courtroom and beyond, turned to
the rubber-stamp Soviet judges with, ``To you I have nothing to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   But the best modern speech in English was more of a poem. Those
who recite Lincoln's brief Gettysburg Address seldom grasp its
conception-birth-death-resurrection theme. A nation `` &UR; conceived &LR; 
in liberty,'' `` &UR; brought forth &LR; '' or born, with all men `` &UR; created &LR; 
equal.'' Then this birth is followed by images of death: `` &UR; final
resting place &LR;  ... honored  &UR; dead &LR; ,'' and verbs of religious
purification like `` &UR; consecrate &LR;  ...  &UR; hallow &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, ``a  &UR; new birth &LR;  of freedom'' in a nation that will
`` &UR; not perish &LR; '' but be immortal. This elaborate construction by a
president steeped in the biblical idiom _ but, like Jefferson, not
known for his religiosity _ was not dashed off on the back of an
envelope.
</P>
<P>
   Those are all ``great'' speeches on momentous occasions. But
there were some shorter remarks made by lesser-known figures that
sparkle in the sands of our time. Sojourner Truth, the evangelist,
with her fierce ``Ain't I a woman?'' pioneered feminism, and Chief
Joseph, known to the Nez Perce as Thunder Traveling to the Loftier
Mountain Heights, ennobled surrender: ``Hear me, my chiefs! I am
tired: My heart is sick and sad. From where the sun now stands I
will fight no more forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is the full text of a sentimental little speech that is the
best I can find of its kind. George Graham Vest, from the
oxymoronic home of Sweet Springs in Saline County, Mo., was a
member of the Confederate Congress during the Civil War; from 1879
to 1903 the skilled debater served as a senator from Missouri. He
is remembered, however, for a speech he made as a young lawyer and
repeated hundreds of times throughout his life.
</P>
<P>
   Vest was representing a plaintiff who sued a neighbor for the
killing of his dog. He ignored his client's charges and the
defendant's testimony; instead, he won the case with a summation on
the theme of fidelity. Swallow hard and read it aloud, standing up,
to your family; there won't be a dry eye in the house.
</P>
<P>
   A cooler Third Millennium may dismiss Vest's ``Tribute to the
Dog'' as a tearjerker, but we rhetoricians of the Second are
prepared to lick the orator's hand.
</P>
<P>
   GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY:
</P>
<P>
   The best friend a man has in the world may turn against him and
become his enemy. His son or daughter that he has reared with
loving care may prove ungrateful. Those who are nearest and dearest
to us, those whom we trust with our happiness and our good name may
become traitors to their faith. The money that a man has, he may
lose. It flies away from him, perhaps when he needs it most. A
man's reputation may be sacrificed in a moment of ill-considered
action.
</P>
<P>
   The people who are prone to fall on their knees to do us honor
when success is with us may be the first to throw the stone of
malice when failure settles its cloud upon our heads.
</P>
<P>
   The one absolutely unselfish friend that man can have in this
selfish world, the one that never deserts him, the one that never
proves ungrateful or treacherous is his dog.
</P>
<P>
   A man's dog stands by him in prosperity and in poverty, in
health and in sickness. He will sleep on the cold ground, where the
wintry winds blow and the snow drives fiercely, if only he may be
near his master's side. He will kiss the hand that has no food to
offer; he will lick the wounds and sores that come in an encounter
with the roughness of the world. He guards the sleep of his pauper
master as if he were a prince.
</P>
<P>
   When all other friends desert, he remains. When riches take
wings, and reputation falls to pieces, he is as constant in his
love as the sun in its journey through the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   If fortune drives the master forth an outcast in the world,
friendless and homeless, the faithful dog asks no higher privilege
than that of accompanying him, to guard him against danger, to
fight against his enemies.
</P>
<P>
   And when the last scene of all comes, and death takes his master
in its embrace and his body is laid away in the cold ground, no
matter if all other friends pursue their way, there by the
graveside will the noble dog be found, his head between his paws,
his eyes sad, but open in alert watchfulness, faithful and true
even in death.

   &UR; Electrifying DNA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DNA is a building block of life, but it might also some day be a
building block of minuscule electronic devices. That is the
tantalizing possibility raised by new research that shows that DNA
conducts electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Previous experiments to determine conductivity have involved
doping the DNA with electron donor and acceptor molecules, and have
been inconclusive. The new work, reported in the journal Nature by
physicists at the University of Basel in Switzerland, is in some
ways simpler. It tests DNA as any substance would be tested for
conductivity, by applying an electrical potential across it and
seeing how much current flows.
</P>
<P>
   With a few strands of DNA, a tiny fraction of an inch long,
however, applying a voltage is not a simple task. The physicists
used a special device known as a low-energy electron point source
microscope that creates a spherical wave of electrons. The
microscope is outfitted with a tiny tungsten tip that is used to
contact the DNA ``wires'' at specific points and apply the
potential to them.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that while DNA will never be a substitute for
copper wire, it does conduct electricity about as efficiently as a
good semiconductor. This property, combined with the fact that it
is now routinely possible to make DNA chains of specific lengths,
makes DNA potentially suitable for constructing submicroscopic, or
``mesoscopic,'' devices.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sponges On the Move &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Sponges do not get around much. Once they form an attachment _
to a stone, shell or other object on the sea floor _ they are stuck
for life. So how do they colonize new areas? Two researchers in
Spain, writing in the journal Nature, have suggested one mechanism.
Like Patsy Cline, brooding sponges may sometimes fall to pieces.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists studied a sponge, Scopalina lophyropoda, that is
found in the western Mediterranean. It reproduces by incubating
embryos that become larvae, which disperse only over short
distances. The researchers found that embryos thrived even after
the sponge was shredded into bits as small as one-twentieth of an
inch across.
</P>
<P>
   Depending upon how far along the reproductive cycle the
shredding occurred, several things happened. In some cases, larvae
were released directly from the loose bits. In others, the pieces
reorganized as sponges, creating an atrium-like chamber where the
embryos continued to incubate.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers suggest that shredding by wave action during a
sponge's reproductive cycle helps its offspring reach new areas.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sluggish Sea Stars &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Sea stars are more mobile than sponges, though even with five or
more legs they will never win a footrace. And a slight decrease in
water temperature, a researcher has found, can turn a slow-moving
sea star into a total slug. This in turn may have profound effects
on the local ecology.
</P>
<P>
   The researcher, from Oregon State University, studied Pisaster
ochraceus, a sea star found on the Oregon coast. Pisaster is what
is known as a keystone predator, an enforcer of affirmative action
in a tidal pool. It feeds on several varieties of mussels, keeping
their populations down and allowing a diverse collection of
organisms to thrive. If Pisaster stops feeding, disaster strikes:
the mussels take over completely.
</P>
<P>
   Pisaster feeding drops drastically, the researcher found, when
water temperatures decrease by 5 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit and many
of the sea stars become inactive. Such drops in water temperature
often occur temporarily along the Oregon coast as ocean currents
cause deep, cold water to well up to the surface during spring and
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The researcher, writing in a recent issue of the journal
Science, noted that during El Nino years, the upwelling water is
warmer. That, plus more systematic changes in water temperature,
could alter the delicate ecological balance between the sea star
and the mussel in a tidal pool.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Needed: One more volume from an aging Marine

<P>
   When last we left Winston Churchill, in the late spring and
early summer of 1940, he had just assumed the role of Prime
Minister of Great Britain, the Germans were racing through Holland
and Belgium, France was being humiliated in the field and Adolf
Hitler's bombers were lambasting England.
</P>
<P>
   So, what happened after that?
</P>
<P>
   It has been 11 years since Volume 2 of William Manchester's
exceptional biography of the British wartime leader was published
and those of us anxious to read the continuation are parched.
</P>
<P>
   This is particularly noteworthy now as some end-of-the-century
retrospectives refer to Churchill as the greatest person of these
past 100 years. Add to that the release this month of a book of
letters Churchill wrote to his wife, ``Winston and Clementine: The
Personal Letters of the Churchills'', and Churchill aficionados are
stirred, now more anxious for Volume 3.
</P>
<P>
   For the longest time, I have been trying to find out where
Manchester is in Volume 3 but neither his publisher, Little, Brown
&AMP; Company, nor Manchester himself is responsive to my queries,
other than to say he's working on the book.
</P>
<P>
   Manchester's first of ``The Last Lion'' series, based on
Churchill's early years (1874-1932) was published in 1984. Five
years later, the second installment was released, bringing
Churchill up to the late spring of 1940.
</P>
<P>
   It was at the conclusion of that volume that Churchill's
predilection to greatness began to emerge. Several days after he
replaced Neville Chamberlain as prime minister, Churchill addressed
the British public via radio. It was during that June 19, 1940
broadcast that Churchill spoke some of the stirring words for which
he is so fondly remembered:
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us therefore brace ourselves to our duties, and so bear
ourselves that if the British Empire and its Commonwealth last for
a thousand years, Men will still say: 'This was their finest hour.'
``
</P>
<P>
   It may have been Manchester's finest hour as well. The writing
(and research) of his first two volumes were outstanding. His
perspective was exceptional, such as this sentence just after the
French sued for peace with the Nazis while the British dug in their
claws.
</P>
<P>
   ``The British were prepared to sacrifice London house by house,
to be destroyed rather than be dishonored. The French loved honor,
but loved Paris more, as they would demonstrate before summer
arrived.''
</P>
<P>
   A newspaper writer joined a group of Manchester's former World
War II Marine Corps buddies at the author's Connecticut home last
October. They reminisced about their days fighting the Japanese on
Guadalcanal and Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manchester is down,'' Paul Reid of the Palm Beach Post
observed of the 77-year-old author. ``He's thin as a nail and just
as tough, but still a little bent at the waist and low in the
shoulder, as if one blow too many fell his way.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, he's aging _ as do us all, but we all didn't go
through the South Pacific with a rifle and bayonet; guys who did
can age quicker.
</P>
<P>
   Letters to Manchester about where he is on Volume 3 go
unanswered, someone at Little, Brown responds to my queries with
the stock answer that Manchester is working on the book and to stay
tuned to future announcements. But none have come since I began
inquiring about the status of Volume 3 last August.
</P>
<P>
   After his October session with Manchester, reporter Reid
commented that Manchester has ``a couple of hundred pages done and
a mountain of notes to collate.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some of us who wonder if Volume 3 of ``The Last Lion''
ever will be completed by Manchester, and it will be a pity if it
isn't. No one can match the perception and ability of Manchester's
writings. We found that out similarly when successors tried to
complete Ernest Hemingway manuscripts. They just weren't Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Manchester doesn't feel he owes the world anything; but,
we do _ at least one more volume about that man Churchill.

LONG HIDDEN, STELLAR PINWHEEL EMERGES FROM THE DUST 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the spiral shapes in nature, like water going down the
bathtub drain, shells like the nautilus or galaxies like the Milky
Way, the long, curving dust tail of two stars was a new sight to
test the explanatory powers of astronomers.
</P>
<P>
   It looked as if a cosmic skywriter had left a fat, upside-down
comma hanging out there in the direction of the constellation
Sagittarius.
</P>
<P>
   In observations by the Keck telescope in Hawaii, astronomers at
the University of California at Berkeley said they were completely
surprised when they detected the spiral pattern of the dust
streaming 18 billion miles out from the star Wolf-Rayet 104.
</P>
<P>
   The star is one of a class of extremely hot, massive stars many
times larger than the Sun. They have a reputation of living fast
and dying young, and this one is probably nearing its explosive
end.
</P>
<P>
   The astronomers had never before been able to focus so finely on
such a distant but dust-obscured star. The spiral tail appeared in
observations of infrared wavelengths that penetrate the dust. The
astronomers compared the achievement to seeing details on the head
of a pin at a distance of two miles.
</P>
<P>
   In a report in the journal Nature last week, the astronomers
showed a picture and gave a likely explanation of the stellar
spiral. They hypothesized that the tail was produced by two stars,
WR 104 and a companion, which are engaged in a courtly dance around
one another.
</P>
<P>
   These orbital motions make the stars behave like a lawn
sprinkler. The stiff winds of gases blowing radially outward from
the stars cool to dust, and rotational motions spin the dust out in
spiral arcs.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter G. Tuthill, a member of the observing team, said that
a sequence of pictures taken over the course of several months last
year revealed motions in the dust plume. ``We saw that the spiral
had moved, had turned on its head,'' he said, ``but it was real.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William C. Danchi, leader of the team, said, ``This is the
first time anyone has gotten any detail of a dusty Wolf-Rayet
star.'' The other team member was John D. Monnier.
</P>
<P>
   Such hot stars, the astronomers explained, are typically three
times the size and 25 times as massive as the Sun. They are
bursting with energy, expelling a high-velocity wind of stellar
gas. In fact, the star has blown off so much of its outer
atmosphere that not much more than its core is left.
</P>
<P>
   But the astronomers realized that the stellar wind, though it
had the necessary chemical ingredients, was so intense that it
should incinerate any dust as soon as it was produced. They
concluded that WR 104 must have another star, almost as massive,
lurking in its vicinity and with a powerful stellar wind of its
own. Both stars are hidden by surrounding dust.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the stellar wind from the companion meets the wind from
the Wolf-Rayet star, a shock front forms, which compresses and
cools the material from the stellar winds,'' Tuthill said. ``It is
in this `cocoon,' shielded from the direct glare of the stars, that
dust formation must flourish.''
</P>
<P>
   From the observations, the extent of the dust tail appears to
correspond to 200 times the distance of Earth from the Sun, or 18
billion miles. Without applying an advanced focusing technique in
infrared at the Keck Observatory, on Mauna Kea, the astronomers
would have seen only a stretched-out blurry patch of light.
</P>
<P>
   The time-lapse pictures showed how the spiral shape seemed to be
the consequence of the dust's being swept radially outward by the
wind from this rotating dust-formation zone. This is the classic
lawn sprinkler spiral, the scientists said, where water is always
flowing straight away from the center, but as the spigot rotates,
the water looks as if it is flowing in a spiral when seen from
above.
</P>
<P>
   As the scientists noted, the pictures are the first to show the
latest addition to the album of celestial phenomena: the spiral
pinwheel star.

SWEET POTATOES TAKE LOTS OF ROOM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) Q. Will you please tell me how to plant sweet
potatoes? Do you plant the potato or the vines? When? _ P.S.,
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   A: Sweet potatoes are not difficult to grow and are high in
nutrients, but you do need space. Or try a compact variety such as
``Porto Rico'' or ``Vardaman'' in a huge container such as a
whiskey barrel.
</P>
<P>
   To have sweet potatoes for Thanksgiving, plant during the second
half of April or in May, when the soil temperature is about 80
degrees. Sweet potatoes need a long, warm growing season to be
harvested in fall.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the morning glory family, sweet potatoes are high in
vitamins, complex carbohydrates and fiber. Like the baked Irish
potato, a sweet potato can be a meal in itself. Lightly fried sweet
potatoes are delicious. And every family has a favorite casserole.
</P>
<P>
   With the proper start, sweet potatoes are a productive crop. One
gardener reported a yield of 300 pounds from a 5- by 40-foot raised
bed.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet potatoes are grown from slips, the shoots that emerge from
the tuber that are grown into plants. They can be ordered from
Gurney's Seed, 110 Capital St., Yankton, S.D. 57079.
</P>
<P>
   You also can grow your own slips:
</P>
<P>
   Plant the tubers on their sides in a flat filled with damp sand.
Cover the roots with 2 inches of sand. As the slips emerge, add
sand. Then gently pull when the shoots are 6 to 8 inches long.
Store at 80 degrees on top of the refrigerator until they are up,
then move to light.
</P>
<P>
   You can insert toothpicks into the tuber and suspend it
partially submerged in a glass of water in a bright spot. When
sprouts begin to grow from the top of the tuber, gently pull them
off and place them in a jar of water until they root.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet potatoes require a deep, sandy soil for best production.
Heavy soils can result in misshapen roots. Poor drainage makes the
plants vulnerable to insects and diseases. Use compost to enrich
the bed and improve drainage. Work in cottonseed meal, or composted
manure for nutrients.
</P>
<P>
   It's best to work the rows into ridges several inches high. Rows
should be about 3 feet apart. Plant the slips 12 to 18 inches apart
in the rows, and 2 to 3 inches deep.
</P>
<P>
   Once the slips are in the ground, water well until they're
established and the vines are starting to crawl. When growth is
good, skip the extra water and don't fertilize. The enriched soil
should supply needed nutrients. Too much water can cause the tubers
to become long and thin.
</P>
<P>
   The vines are so prolific they often shade the soil and prevent
weeds. If you have a good start and everything's going strong after
June, just wait until November, then harvest.
</P>
<P>
   Mulching a sweet potato bed will help prevent the vigorous vines
from rooting, which will create several small potatoes rather than
a few large ones.
</P>
<P>
   Gently dig out the sweet potatoes when morning temperatures drop
below 50 in the fall. Usually this occurs near Thanksgiving or at
least by early December. Sweet potatoes don't like the cold.
</P>
<P>
   The vegetables need to be cured once they're harvested. Remove
the vines, wash the tubers and let them dry in the sun. You can
place the sweet potatoes on newspaper in shaded boxes in a place
where temperatures are between 70 and 80 degrees. The top of the
refrigerator or a spot by the hot water heater should be fine. Do
not refrigerate the sweet potatoes or they'll rot. Store in this
warm spot until the potatoes harden, usually in just a few weeks,
then store them in a cooler spot where temperatures are 50 to 60
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beauregard,'' which has deep orange flesh,
light-purple/rose-colored skin and is wilt- and nematode-resistant,
has proved productive in southeast Texas. It eats up a lot of
space. This variety needs 90 to 100 days until harvest. Other sweet
potatoes to try in this area are ``Georgia Jet,'' a
deep-orange-fleshed sweet that produces in 90 days; ``Centennial,''
a deep orange; ``Jewell,'' a fine-textured orange that's resistant
to wilt and root-knot nematodes; ``Porto Rico,'' a deep orange
bush/vine; and ``Vardaman,'' a deep red-orange bush sweet potato
that requires a longer growing season.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Rustic, bold, inspired Mediterranean cuisine and
layered flavors soar from Todd English's kitchens and stoves,
whether at his Olives restaurants in Las Vegas or Charlestown,
Mass., or at his four Figs restaurants in the greater Boston area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The essence of Figs and Olives are the same,'' says English,
``but Figs is funkier, everyday food. It's simpler, more casual,
and more affordable than Olives.''
</P>
<P>
   If you've never had an opportunity to sample English's wonderful
cuisine, now you can whip up some of the dishes served in his Figs'
restaurants (along with some of the stuff he does at home) in your
own kitchen. There are more than 100 creations for pizzas,
risottos, pastas, salads and desserts to give you a sense of his
style in his latest and second cookbook, ``The Figs Table,'' (Simon
&AMP; Schuster; $25), co-authored with Sally Sampson. Unlike recipes in
some chefs' cookbooks, English's have been tested and adapted to
home kitchens by Sampson, several friends and a variety of cooks.
</P>
<P>
   Most recipes appear to be user-friendly, simple to prepare and
do-able for home cooks. For the most part, ingredient lists are
manageable, and preparation steps have been streamlined. Many of
the dishes sound so tempting they make you want to scurry into the
kitchen and get cooking as you're reading them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This volume is geared to 30-minute recipes or under, except
for the pizza, which takes longer,'' noted English, adding that
more people are now cooking pizza at home and want to do something
different.
</P>
<P>
   English makes interesting and innovative free-form thin-crusted
pizzas (so thin they are almost brittle) like you've probably never
tasted _ with toppings like littleneck clams; figs and prosciutto
(his Figs signature dish); fresh asparagus and mushroom puree;
kielbasa, sauerkraut, potatoes and Dijon mustard aioli; white bean
hummus and asiago cheese; and spicy shrimp, caramelized leeks and
tomato sauce. The only equipment needed, said English, is a strong
mind, a strong will, an unglazed stone and a wooden peel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history of what I am about and what I've done can be found
in my first cookbook, `The Olives Table,' which came out a little
more than two years ago. There's a correlation between the two, but
`The Figs Table' is a simpler, easier, everyday, more homey
cookbook,'' noted English.
</P>
<P>
   He'll have succeeded in making this a working cookbook, he said
with a laugh, if cooks' copies have dog-eared and food-stained
pages.
</P>
<P>
   Passionate about his cooking, English boils his philosophy down
to taking common ingredients and doing unusual things with them. He
aims to give diners a choice of culinary fireworks on their plates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe cooking is about using all five of your senses _
sight (visual side), smell (best memory), feel in mouth (textural
difference), how it sounds (sizzle in pan) and, ultimately, taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taste is the most important to me. I never forget that food is
supposed to taste good. I think some of the ugliest food tastes the
best _ like braised greens cooked to death with ham hocks. Eaten
with bread with Parmesan cheese, you're, like, in heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   For his inspirations, English pulls from traditions, the
classics and his travels. ``I don't believe cuisines are 100
percent transferable _ basically meaning that you can bring the
influence but you can't bring the feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're eating spaghetti with clams on the Italian Riviera,
there's a certain air, scent, type of water and such that makes the
dish and meal. Eating the dish in Boston or Los Angeles isn't the
same. However, it's possible to do a dish similar in style and
serve it here, noted English.
</P>
<P>
   Presentation is also important, but English believes it should
not be too fussy and not overplayed. ``It should be very natural,
not contrived.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes ``The Figs Table'' sparkle and come alive are the
accompanying recipe notes, which give a range of preparation and
serving tips along with info about the origin of a recipe _ or
recipe expectations regarding flavor or color. They give you a
glimpse of the chef's personality and cooking style. For instance,
the Basil Aioli recipe notes, ``Don't be surprised when you end up
with yellow aioli; this will not be green.'' Accompanying the Figs
Pizza Dough recipe is this bit of information: ``Our dough is far
wetter than you'd ever believe; it makes a light, crisp crust.''
</P>
<P>
   English has his finger in many other pots besides his
restaurants these days. He's marketing a line of frozen pastas,
salad dressings, beers and mustards, which are currently sold in
Boston supermarkets. Plans are to roll them out nationally within
the next couple of years along with a line of frozen-food entrees.
As the host of a public television cooking show, ``Cooking In With
Todd English,'' he'll be filming the second series of 13 shows next
month. A dessert cookbook is also in the works.
</P>
<P>
   Now savor and share English's robust food with a sampling of
recipes from his cookbooks.

   ROASTED CARROT AND FETA SALAD WITH ZA'ATAR &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; I first tried this style of salad on mezza tables in Israel and
now I can't get enough. You can also substitute almost any root
vegetable alone or in combination, including potatoes, parsnips,
sweet potatoes or beets.
</P>
<P>
   You can make this without the za'atar, but if you try it, you'll
be glad you did. Although za'atar means ``thyme'' in Arabic, when
used as a seasoning it usually refers to a mixture of sumac, dried
thyme, marjoram, salt and varying amounts of sesame seeds: The end
result is a bit sour and tangy. Brad Stevens, Figs executive chef,
prefers Jordanian za'atar for its lavish use of sesame seeds, but I
prefer Lebanese. Za'atar can be found in Middle Eastern and
specialty food stores.
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 pounds carrots, peeled, if desired, quartered lengthwise
and cut into angled 1-inch slices
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup crumbled Bulgarian, French OR Greek feta cheese
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon za'atar OR more to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley OR cilantro
</P>
<P>
   Place carrots, olive oil, salt and pepper on a baking sheet;
toss well. Roast in preheated 425-degree oven, shaking
occasionally, about 30 minutes, until just beginning to brown.
Carrots should be firm and not mushy. Transfer to a medium serving
bowl. Add remaining ingredients and toss well.
</P>
<P>
   Serve immediately or cover and refrigerate up to 4 hours. Makes
4 to 6 servings.

QUICK WHITE BEAN HUMMUS
</P>
<P>
   I've replaced the traditional chickpeas with white beans to
create a lighter taste and texture. Use this as a dip for crudites
or crispy crackers or as a sandwich spread with smoked ham and
tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   2 cups cooked white cannellini beans, rinsed and drained
</P>
<P>
   3 garlic cloves, crushed OR finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/4 to 1/2 cup water
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground cumin OR more to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon Hungarian paprika
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   Place beans and garlic in a food processor fitted with a steel
blade and process until smooth. While machine is running, gradually
add remaining ingredients and process until smooth. Serve
immediately or cover and refrigerate up to 3 days. Makes about 1
1/4 cups.

FIGS PIZZA DOUGH &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; With a little bit of time and effort, Figs pizza dough can
easily be mastered. However, if you don't have the time or are
intimidated by working with yeast, call a local pizza place and see
if they'll sell you some of their dough. Also, some Italian delis
sell the dough. If you use a heavy, bready, prebaked, vacuum-packed
pizza crust, it just won't be the same.
</P>
<P>
   This dough is far wetter than you'd ever believe; it makes a
light crisp crust. It may take you a few tries before you get it
right. Be patient and err on the side of underworking the dough; if
you overwork it, the crust will be tough and dry.
</P>
<P>
   This recipe makes four rounds of pizza, though the topping
recipes make two pizzas. We figure that this way you only have to
make the dough every other time. Simply wrap the remaining two
balls of dough in plastic wrap and freeze, up to two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup whole-wheat flour
</P>
<P>
   3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus additional for rolling
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons (1/4 ounce) fresh yeast
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 2/3 cups lukewarm water &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Place whole-wheat flour, all-purpose flour, yeast, salt and
sugar in a mixer fitted with a dough hook. While mixer is running,
gradually add oil and water. Knead on low speed, about 10 minutes,
until dough is firm and smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Divide dough into 4 balls, about 7 1/2 ounces each. Line 2
baking sheets with parchment paper. Place 2 balls on a sheet and
cover with a damp towel. Let rise in a warm spot until doubled in
bulk, about 2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   To roll out dough, dab your fingers in flour and then place 1
ball on a generously floured work surface and press down in center
with tips of your fingers, spreading dough with your hand. When
dough has doubled in width, use a floured rolling pin and roll out
until very thin, like flatbread. The outer border should be a
little thicker than inner circle. Pick dough up with a spatula or
back of a knife, allowing it to fold up almost like an umbrella and
transfer to a paddle. Do not worry that pizza is not round; you are
looking for an 8- to 10-inch shape, a cross between an oval and a
rectangle. If you get a hole, simply pinch edges back together.
Repeat with remaining balls and proceed with the following recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 (8- to 10-inch) pizza dough rounds. Each pizza will
serve 1 to 2 people. &UR;

   &LR; FIG AND PROSCIUTTO PIZZA
</P>
<P>
   One of my favorites, this pizza is lush and intense, with the
sweetness of the Fig Jam contrasting with the salt of the
prosciutto and the tang of the Gorgonzola.
</P>
<P>
   You need to take a little extra care when assembling this pizza.
The Gorgonzola must go on in droplets rather than in big clumps and
the prosciutto must be paper thin so that it literally melts onto
the warm pizza.
</P>
<P>
   2 Figs Pizza Dough rounds (recipe above)
</P>
<P>
   Cornmeal for sprinkling
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   2 pinches kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   2 pinches black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup Fig Jam (recipe follows)
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces Gorgonzola cheese, crumbled into pea-sized pieces
</P>
<P>
   3 ounces thinly sliced prosciutto
</P>
<P>
   1 green onion, thinly sliced lengthwise, for garnish
</P>
<P>
   One hour prior to cooking, place a baking stone in oven and
preheat to 500 degrees F.
</P>
<P>
   Roll out 1 pizza dough round as thinly as possible. Place on a
pizza peel sprinkled with cornmeal. Cover surface with 1 teaspoon
oil, 1/4 teaspoon minced garlic, 1 pinch EACH salt and pepper and
1/2 teaspoon chopped rosemary. Be sure to leave an outer lip of
1-inch all the way around.
</P>
<P>
   Evenly dot 1/4 cup Fig Jam and 2 ounces Gorgonzola cheese on
pizza. Top with 1/2 of prosciutto.
</P>
<P>
   Shake paddle lightly and slide pizza onto baking stone. Bake
about 6 to 7 minutes or until browned. Transfer to a firm surface
and cut into slices.
</P>
<P>
   Serve immediately, garnished with 1/2 of sliced green onion.
</P>
<P>
   Repeat with remaining dough and ingredients. Makes 2 pizzas. &UR;

</P>
<P>
   &LR; FIG JAM
</P>
<P>
   Fig jam is more like a dried fruit preserve than a true jam. We
use it primarily on our Fig and Prosciutto Pizza, but after you've
tried it, I'm sure you'll come up with your own uses.
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon canola OR vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   3 shallots, diced
</P>
<P>
   1 cup red wine
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup canned low-sodium chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup veal OR beef broth
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 rounded cup dried mission figs, quartered
</P>
<P>
   Place a medium skillet over medium heat and, when hot, add oil.
Add shallots and cook until softened, about 3 minutes. Deglaze with
red wine and reduce by 1/2. Add broths and vinegar and reduce by
1/2. Add rosemary and sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Reduce heat to low and cook until sugar has melted, about 3 to 5
minutes. Add figs and cook, stirring occasionally, until
rehydrated, about 10 to 12 minutes. Cook until mixture has
consistency of a liquidy jam, about 10 to 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Use immediately or cover and refrigerate up to 5 days. Makes
about 1 cup.

CLAM PIZZA
</P>
<P>
   Pepe's clam pizza is legendary. It was made famous by Pepe's in
New Haven, Conn., a world-famous pizzeria whose owner claims to
have invented American Pizza. When I was in high school, we used to
hang out at Pepe's, but now that I live in Boston, I always stop
off on my way to and from New York City, which is less often than I
would like.
</P>
<P>
   When you put the clams on the pizza, be sure to include the
liquor, which contributes enormous flavor. And don't be tempted to
increase the Parmesan cheese; if you do, you'll overwhelm the
clams. Keep the clams refrigerated until ready to use and shuck
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   18 to 24 littleneck clams, well washed, shucked and very roughly
chopped, including clam liquor
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons fresh oregano leaves
</P>
<P>
   2 Figs Pizza Dough rounds (recipe above)
</P>
<P>
   Cornmeal for sprinkling
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   2 pinches kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   2 pinches black pepper
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley for garnish
</P>
<P>
   One hour prior to cooking, place a baking stone in oven and
preheat to 500 degrees F.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, place clams and their liquor, oil and 1
teaspoon oregano in a bowl; toss to combine and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Roll out 1 pizza dough round as thinly as possible. Place on a
pizza peel sprinkled with cornmeal. Cover surface with 1/4 teaspoon
minced garlic and 1 pinch EACH salt and pepper. Be sure to leave an
outer lip of 1-inch all the way around.
</P>
<P>
   Evenly distribute 1/2 of clam mixture, including liquor, over
pizza. Top with 1 teaspoon oregano and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon
grated Parmesan cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Shake paddle lightly and slide pizza onto baking stone. Bake
until browned, about 6 to 7 minutes or until browned. Transfer to a
firm surface and cut into slices.
</P>
<P>
   Serve immediately, garnished with 1/2 teaspoon oregano, 1 1/2
teaspoons Parmesan cheese and 1 tablespoon parsley.

   WHITE-CHOCOLATE CHALLAH PUDDING
</P>
<P>
   This is one of our four most popular desserts. It's luscious and
smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't like white chocolate, you'll love this. It has
the appearance of being light, but in fact it is one of the richest
desserts we make. Serve it with a raspberry sauce to cut the
richness or caramel sauce or chocolate sauce to enhance it.
</P>
<P>
   7 large egg yolks
</P>
<P>
   2 whole eggs
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons vanilla
</P>
<P>
   3 cups whipping cream
</P>
<P>
   1 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   10 ounces white chocolate, about 2 cups chopped
</P>
<P>
   4 cups challah cubes, about 1 loaf, crusts removed, if desired
</P>
<P>
   Place egg yolks, eggs and vanilla in a small bowl and mix to
combine. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Place whipping cream, milk and sugar in a 2-quart saucpan over
medium-high heat and cook until scalded or when bubbles begin to
form around edges and it has not quite come to a boil, about 7
minutes. Add white chocolate and mix until fully melted. Gradually
add egg mixture in a slow steady stream, whisking constantly.
</P>
<P>
   Place bread cubes in an 8x8-inch pan and cover with egg-cream
mixture. Press cubes down and let stand, 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Cover with foil and place in a larger pan filled halfway with
very hot water. Transfer to preheated 350-degree oven and bake
about 1 hour and 15 minutes until firm and, when touched in middle,
custard does not show up on your finger. Check to see if water
needs to be replenished after 30 minutes. If so, add enough to keep
water level at halfway point. Serve warm with fresh berries,
raspberry sauce or caramel sauce. Makes 6 servings.

   TUNA TARTARE
</P>
<P>
   This tuna is great served on cucumber slices or toast points.
Before you make this dish, be sure you have a good relationship
with a reputable fishmonger and let him know that you will be
serving the fish raw. Ask for yellowfin or bluefin tuna and accept
only tuna with a vibrant, garnet-red color, a firm texture and
absolutely no odor. Remember that raw fish is very rich, so serve
small amounts.
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds very fresh bluefin OR yellowfin tuna, diced into
pieces the size of a raisin
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil leaves
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro leaves
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon finely chopped peeled fresh ginger
</P>
<P>
   Greens from 1 bunch green onions, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/2 to 1 teaspoon Vietnamese chili paste (see Note)
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 to 2 teaspoons kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl, combine all ingredients. Cover and chill for no
longer than 1 hour before serving. Serve on cucumber slices or
toast points. Makes 8 servings.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: If you cannot find Vietnamese chili paste, substitute
Chinese or Thai chili paste, which you should be able to find in
any well-stocked grocery store. Because different brands vary in
degree of hotness, add a small amount at a time and taste after
each addition.

BROOKLYN PORTERHOUSE WITH CILANTRO MARINADE
</P>
<P>
   Brooklyn porterhouse is a term that the meat packers in the old
Jewish sections of New York used for skirt steak in the early '20s.
I can be sure they didn't use this heady marinade for what is one
of my favorite cuts.
</P>
<P>
   CILANTRO MARINADE:
</P>
<P>
   2 roasted garlic cloves, peeled
</P>
<P>

   1 1/2 to 2 pounds skirt OR flank steak
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon black pepper &UR; !off! &LR;
</P>
<P>
   For Cilantro Marinade, place roasted garlic, mustard, cilantro,
lemon peel, balsamic vinegar and oil in a large shallow glass or
ceramic bowl and mash to a paste.
</P>
<P>
   For Steak, place skirt steak in marinade. Cover and refrigerate
at least 8 hours or overnight, turning occasionally.

<P>
   Prepare grill or preheat broiler.
</P>
<P>
   Remove steak from marinade. Sprinkle both sides of steak with
salt and pepper.

   TUNA TARTARE
</P>
<P>
   This tuna is great served on cucumber slices or toast points.
Before you make this dish, be sure you have a good relationship
with a reputable fishmonger and let him know that you will be
serving the fish raw. Ask for yellowfin or bluefin tuna and accept
only tuna with a vibrant, garnet-red color, a firm texture and
absolutely no odor. Remember that raw fish is very rich, so serve
small amounts.
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds very fresh bluefin OR yellowfin tuna, diced into
pieces the size of a raisin
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil leaves
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped fresh cilantro leaves
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon finely chopped peeled fresh ginger
</P>
<P>
   Greens from 1 bunch green onions, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/2 to 1 teaspoon Vietnamese chili paste (see Note)
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 to 2 teaspoons kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil
</P>
<P>
   In a large bowl, combine all ingredients. Cover and chill for no
longer than 1 hour before serving. Serve on cucumber slices or
toast points. Makes 8 servings.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: If you cannot find Vietnamese chili paste, substitute
Chinese or Thai chili paste, which you should be able to find in
any well-stocked grocery store. Because different brands vary in
degree of hotness, add a small amount at a time and taste after
each addition.

BROOKLYN PORTERHOUSE WITH CILANTRO MARINADE
</P>
<P>
   Brooklyn porterhouse is a term that the meat packers in the old
Jewish sections of New York used for skirt steak in the early '20s.
I can be sure they didn't use this heady marinade for what is one
of my favorite cuts.
</P>
<P>
   CILANTRO MARINADE:
</P>
<P>
   2 roasted garlic cloves, peeled
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro
</P>
<P>
   Grated peel of 1/2 lemon
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   STEAK:
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 to 2 pounds skirt OR flank steak
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon black pepper &UR; !off! &LR;
</P>
<P>
   For Cilantro Marinade, place roasted garlic, mustard, cilantro,
lemon peel, balsamic vinegar and oil in a large shallow glass or
ceramic bowl and mash to a paste.
</P>
<P>
   For Steak, place skirt steak in marinade. Cover and refrigerate
at least 8 hours or overnight, turning occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare grill or preheat broiler.
</P>
<P>
   Remove steak from marinade. Sprinkle both sides of steak with
salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Grill or broil about 5 minutes per side for medium-rare. Thinly
slice on diagonal and serve. Makes 4 servings.

PROFILE OF TODD ENGLISH, AUTHOR OF `THE FIGS TABLE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TODD ENGLISH
</P>
<P>
   AGE: 38.
</P>
<P>
   PROFESSION: Chef/restaurateur.
</P>
<P>
   HOMETOWN: Amarillo, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   FOOD BACKGROUND: English grew up watching his mom, of Italian
descent and a great cook, and his grandmother prepare lots of
Italian dishes, including ravioli. When he was 9 years old, he
asked for a hand-crank ice cream machine _ and started making ice
cream for the family. He also grilled a lot and did other cooking
to help out in the absence of his father.
</P>
<P>
   During high school, he worked at both Mexican and French
restaurants in Branford, Conn. Then he spent a year working as a
line cook at a hotel in Atlanta and one summer worked at a seafood
restaurant on Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   He debated about going to the ``school of hard knocks'' or
getting formal culinary training. The Culinary Institute of America
in Hyde Park, N.Y., won out, and he graduated in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   After several years' experience out of school, he had his fill
of doing the ``Frenchy thing'' and wanted to get back to the
Italian-style cooking of his roots. He landed a job as the
executive chef at a new restaurant, Michela's, in Cambridge, Mass.
Before he took over, he traveled to Northern Italy and worked in
six different restaurants in six months. His wife, Olivia, who he
met at CIA (she was also a student there) handled the front of the
house at Michela's.
</P>
<P>
   The couple stayed there three years and then left to open their
own 45-seat restaurant _ Olives in Charlestown, Mass. _ in April
1989 _ serving English's interpretive Mediterranean cuisine. The
restaurant has since moved to a larger space and has consistently
been named Boston's favorite restaurant by the Zagat survey.
</P>
<P>
   Today English has eight restaurants, including two that recently
opened in Las Vegas _ Olives in the Bellagio hotel and Onda in the
Mirage _ and one in Westport, Conn., Miramar in the Inn at National
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   COOKING STYLE: Mediterranean-inspired cuisine with a strong
influence from ethnic or everyday food that is rooted in the
traditional cooking of the people.
</P>
<P>
   KITCHEN SECRET: He believes in chemistry on the plate _ and it
is best when it is layered and becomes a melange of flavors that
explodes in your mouth.
</P>
<P>
   MOST POPULAR DISH HE MAKES: Herb and butter-basted spit-roasted
chicken.
</P>
<P>
   THREE FAVORITE FOODS: Spaghetti with butter and Parmesan cheese;
a big, thick grilled sirloin steak; chocolate chip cookies.
</P>
<P>
   FAVORITE JUNK FOOD: Fritos.
</P>
<P>
   FOOD HE HATES: Dill.
</P>
<P>
   SECRET FOOD PASSION: Sushi.
</P>
<P>
   FAVORITE KITCHEN GADGET: Offset spatula (a narrow one).
</P>
<P>
   PET PEEVE: He can't stand dirty spoons on the line (used to
sauce and plate food) and dirty spoon water in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   FAVORITE COOKBOOK: ``Culture and Cuisine, A Journey Through the
History of Food'' by John Francoise Revel (a French book translated
into English; published by Doubleday in 1982).
</P>
<P>
   IDEAL VACATION: A place with a beach, plenty of golf, tennis and
activities _ and of course great food and wine at dinner.
</P>
<P>
   FAVORITE RESTAURANT: Marc Veyrat in Annecy, France.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT DOES HE DO WHEN NOT COOKING?: Plays a lot of sports.
</P>
<P>
   IF HE COULDN'T BE A CHEF, WHAT WOULD HE BE?: A baseball player,
or work in the creative end of advertising.
</P>
<P>
   DREAM JOB: ``I've got it.''
</P>
<P>
   WORST KITCHEN DISASTER: While preparing a special private dinner
for foreign dignitaries at a townhouse in Boston several years ago,
the fire-extinguishing system went off, and all the finished sauces
and food got dusted with white powder. Everything had to be thrown
out, and English had to run out and get other ingredients and food.
It took him about an hour to recover and remake the dinner.
</P>
<P>
   IF HE COULD DINE WITH ANYONE (CURRENT OR IN HISTORY), WHO WOULD
IT BE?: Thomas Jefferson, Auguste Escoffier and Courteney Cox.
</P>
<P>
   MOST MEMORABLE MEAL: Poulet bresse with 40 cloves of garlic at
Tante Paulette, a small restaurant in Lyon, France.
</P>
<P>
   THE WORST PART OF BEING A CHEF: He doesn't have much time to see
his three children, ages 9, 6 and 3.

   ROASTED CARROT AND FETA SALAD WITH ZA'ATAR &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; I first tried this style of salad on mezza tables in Israel and
now I can't get enough. You can also substitute almost any root
vegetable alone or in combination, including potatoes, parsnips,
sweet potatoes or beets.
</P>
<P>
   You can make this without the za'atar, but if you try it, you'll
be glad you did. Although za'atar means ``thyme'' in Arabic, when
used as a seasoning it usually refers to a mixture of sumac, dried
thyme, marjoram, salt and varying amounts of sesame seeds: The end
result is a bit sour and tangy. Brad Stevens, Figs executive chef,
prefers Jordanian za'atar for its lavish use of sesame seeds, but I
prefer Lebanese. Za'atar can be found in Middle Eastern and
specialty food stores.
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 pounds carrots, peeled, if desired, quartered lengthwise
and cut into angled 1-inch slices
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon black pepper
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup crumbled Bulgarian, French OR Greek feta cheese
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon za'atar OR more to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley OR cilantro
</P>
<P>
   Place carrots, olive oil, salt and pepper on a baking sheet;
toss well. Roast in preheated 425-degree oven, shaking
occasionally, about 30 minutes, until just beginning to brown.
Carrots should be firm and not mushy. Transfer to a medium serving
bowl. Add remaining ingredients and toss well.
</P>
<P>
   Serve immediately or cover and refrigerate up to 4 hours. Makes
4 to 6 servings.

<P>
   QUICK WHITE BEAN HUMMUS
</P>
<P>
   I've replaced the traditional chickpeas with white beans to
create a lighter taste and texture. Use this as a dip for crudites
or crispy crackers or as a sandwich spread with smoked ham and
tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   2 cups cooked white cannellini beans, rinsed and drained
</P>
<P>
   3 garlic cloves, crushed OR finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/4 to 1/2 cup water
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground cumin OR more to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon Hungarian paprika
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   Place beans and garlic in a food processor fitted with a steel
blade and process until smooth. While machine is running, gradually
add remaining ingredients and process until smooth. Serve
immediately or cover and refrigerate up to 3 days. Makes about 1
1/4 cups.

FIGS PIZZA DOUGH &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; With a little bit of time and effort, Figs pizza dough can
easily be mastered. However, if you don't have the time or are
intimidated by working with yeast, call a local pizza place and see
if they'll sell you some of their dough. Also, some Italian delis
sell the dough. If you use a heavy, bready, prebaked, vacuum-packed
pizza crust, it just won't be the same.
</P>
<P>
   This dough is far wetter than you'd ever believe; it makes a
light crisp crust. It may take you a few tries before you get it
right. Be patient and err on the side of underworking the dough; if
you overwork it, the crust will be tough and dry.
</P>
<P>
   This recipe makes four rounds of pizza, though the topping
recipes make two pizzas. We figure that this way you only have to
make the dough every other time. Simply wrap the remaining two
balls of dough in plastic wrap and freeze, up to two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup whole-wheat flour
</P>
<P>
   3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus additional for rolling
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons (1/4 ounce) fresh yeast
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 2/3 cups lukewarm water &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Place whole-wheat flour, all-purpose flour, yeast, salt and
sugar in a mixer fitted with a dough hook. While mixer is running,
gradually add oil and water. Knead on low speed, about 10 minutes,
until dough is firm and smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Divide dough into 4 balls, about 7 1/2 ounces each. Line 2
baking sheets with parchment paper. Place 2 balls on a sheet and
cover with a damp towel. Let rise in a warm spot until doubled in
bulk, about 2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   To roll out dough, dab your fingers in flour and then place 1
ball on a generously floured work surface and press down in center
with tips of your fingers, spreading dough with your hand. When
dough has doubled in width, use a floured rolling pin and roll out
until very thin, like flatbread. The outer border should be a
little thicker than inner circle. Pick dough up with a spatula or
back of a knife, allowing it to fold up almost like an umbrella and
transfer to a paddle. Do not worry that pizza is not round; you are
looking for an 8- to 10-inch shape, a cross between an oval and a
rectangle. If you get a hole, simply pinch edges back together.
Repeat with remaining balls and proceed with the following recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 (8- to 10-inch) pizza dough rounds. Each pizza will
serve 1 to 2 people. &UR;

   &LR; FIG AND PROSCIUTTO PIZZA
</P>
<P>
   One of my favorites, this pizza is lush and intense, with the
sweetness of the Fig Jam contrasting with the salt of the
prosciutto and the tang of the Gorgonzola.
</P>
<P>
   You need to take a little extra care when assembling this pizza.
The Gorgonzola must go on in droplets rather than in big clumps and
the prosciutto must be paper thin so that it literally melts onto
the warm pizza.
</P>
<P>
   2 Figs Pizza Dough rounds (recipe above)
</P>
<P>
   Cornmeal for sprinkling
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   2 pinches kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   2 pinches black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup Fig Jam (recipe follows)
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces Gorgonzola cheese, crumbled into pea-sized pieces
</P>
<P>
   3 ounces thinly sliced prosciutto
</P>
<P>
   1 green onion, thinly sliced lengthwise, for garnish
</P>
<P>
   One hour prior to cooking, place a baking stone in oven and
preheat to 500 degrees F.
</P>
<P>
   Roll out 1 pizza dough round as thinly as possible. Place on a
pizza peel sprinkled with cornmeal. Cover surface with 1 teaspoon
oil, 1/4 teaspoon minced garlic, 1 pinch EACH salt and pepper and
1/2 teaspoon chopped rosemary. Be sure to leave an outer lip of
1-inch all the way around.
</P>
<P>
   Evenly dot 1/4 cup Fig Jam and 2 ounces Gorgonzola cheese on
pizza. Top with 1/2 of prosciutto.
</P>
<P>
   Shake paddle lightly and slide pizza onto baking stone. Bake
about 6 to 7 minutes or until browned. Transfer to a firm surface
and cut into slices.
</P>
<P>
   Serve immediately, garnished with 1/2 of sliced green onion.
</P>
<P>
   Repeat with remaining dough and ingredients. Makes 2 pizzas. &UR;

   &LR; FIG JAM
</P>
<P>
   Fig jam is more like a dried fruit preserve than a true jam. We
use it primarily on our Fig and Prosciutto Pizza, but after you've
tried it, I'm sure you'll come up with your own uses.
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon canola OR vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   3 shallots, diced
</P>
<P>
   1 cup red wine
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup canned low-sodium chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup veal OR beef broth
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 rounded cup dried mission figs, quartered
</P>
<P>
   Place a medium skillet over medium heat and, when hot, add oil.
Add shallots and cook until softened, about 3 minutes. Deglaze with
red wine and reduce by 1/2. Add broths and vinegar and reduce by
1/2. Add rosemary and sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Reduce heat to low and cook until sugar has melted, about 3 to 5
minutes. Add figs and cook, stirring occasionally, until
rehydrated, about 10 to 12 minutes. Cook until mixture has
consistency of a liquidy jam, about 10 to 12 minutes.
</P>

CLAM PIZZA
</P>
<P>
   Pepe's clam pizza is legendary. It was made famous by Pepe's in
New Haven, Conn., a world-famous pizzeria whose owner claims to
have invented American Pizza. When I was in high school, we used to
hang out at Pepe's, but now that I live in Boston, I always stop
off on my way to and from New York City, which is less often than I
would like.
</P>
<P>
   When you put the clams on the pizza, be sure to include the
liquor, which contributes enormous flavor. And don't be tempted to
increase the Parmesan cheese; if you do, you'll overwhelm the
clams. Keep the clams refrigerated until ready to use and shuck
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   18 to 24 littleneck clams, well washed, shucked and very roughly
chopped, including clam liquor
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons fresh oregano leaves
</P>
<P>
   2 Figs Pizza Dough rounds (recipe above)
</P>
<P>
   Cornmeal for sprinkling
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   2 pinches kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   2 pinches black pepper
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley for garnish
</P>
<P>
   One hour prior to cooking, place a baking stone in oven and
preheat to 500 degrees F.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, place clams and their liquor, oil and 1
teaspoon oregano in a bowl; toss to combine and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Roll out 1 pizza dough round as thinly as possible. Place on a
pizza peel sprinkled with cornmeal. Cover surface with 1/4 teaspoon
minced garlic and 1 pinch EACH salt and pepper. Be sure to leave an
outer lip of 1-inch all the way around.
</P>
<P>
   Evenly distribute 1/2 of clam mixture, including liquor, over
pizza. Top with 1 teaspoon oregano and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon
grated Parmesan cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Shake paddle lightly and slide pizza onto baking stone. Bake
until browned, about 6 to 7 minutes or until browned. Transfer to a
firm surface and cut into slices.
</P>
<P>
   Serve immediately, garnished with 1/2 teaspoon oregano, 1 1/2
teaspoons Parmesan cheese and 1 tablespoon parsley.
</P>
<P>
   Repeat with remaining dough nd ingredients. Makes 2 pizzas.

   WHITE-CHOCOLATE CHALLAH PUDDING
</P>
<P>
   This is one of our four most popular desserts. It's luscious and
smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't like white chocolate, you'll love this. It has
the appearance of being light, but in fact it is one of the richest
desserts we make. Serve it with a raspberry sauce to cut the
richness or caramel sauce or chocolate sauce to enhance it.
</P>
<P>
   7 large egg yolks
</P>
<P>
   2 whole eggs
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons vanilla
</P>
<P>
   3 cups whipping cream
</P>
<P>
   1 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   10 ounces white chocolate, about 2 cups chopped
</P>
<P>
   4 cups challah cubes, about 1 loaf, crusts removed, if desired
</P>
<P>
   Place egg yolks, eggs and vanilla in a small bowl and mix to
combine. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Place whipping cream, milk and sugar in a 2-quart saucpan over
medium-high heat and cook until scalded or when bubbles begin to
form around edges and it has not quite come to a boil, about 7
minutes. Add white chocolate and mix until fully melted. Gradually
add egg mixture in a slow steady stream, whisking constantly.
</P>
<P>
   Place bread cubes in an 8x8-inch pan and cover with egg-cream
mixture. Press cubes down and let stand, 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Cover with foil and place in a larger pan filled halfway with
very hot water. Transfer to preheated 350-degree oven and bake
about 1 hour and 15 minutes until firm and, when touched in middle,
custard does not show up on your finger. Check to see if water
needs to be replenished after 30 minutes. If so, add enough to keep
water level at halfway point. Serve warm with fresh berries,
raspberry sauce or caramel sauce. Makes 6 servings.

   &UR; Bird Bombs  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why are bird droppings whitish or spotted with white?
</P>
<P>
   A. Bird droppings combine the whitish waste products processed
by the liver and kidneys with the darker wastes that come from the
digestive tract, according to ``The Manual of Ornithology,'' by
Noble S. Proctor and Patrick J. Lynch (Yale University Press,
1993). In birds, the nitrogen-rich wastes are turned into a
white-colored paste that is composed mostly of urates. The urates
often form a separate white blob, as anyone who has worn a new hat
outdoors at the wrong time has probably noticed.
</P>
<P>
   The excretory system of birds is different from that of mammals
because it takes up a minimum of space and requires a minimum of
water for processing.
</P>
<P>
   In mammals, nitrogen waste is turned into urea, a toxic
substance that requires large amounts of water to flush it safely
from the system and a urinary bladder as a holding tank for all the
liquid.
</P>
<P>
   The urates excreted by birds, on the other hand, are
concentrated but not toxic, and most birds do not have bladders to
hold liquid to flush it out.

   &UR; Surfing the Internet Via the Step Machine &LR;
</P>
<P>
   It is no secret that Americans have short attention spans when
it comes to exercise. Go to any gym, and people will be reading
magazines and listening to music to keep themselves entertained on
cardio machines.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage their disenchanted members, health clubs are
installing consoles onto step machines and stationary bikes to
allow users to surf the Internet, watch their own cable
televisions, listen to CD's and call up past workout records each
time they log on to a machine.
</P>
<P>
   Netpulse Communications of San Francisco, started manufacturing
the consoles in 1995, and they are available at about 300 fitness
centers nationwide. The Can Do Club, which opens this week in
Wayne, N.J., is offering Netpulse on all of its compatible exercise
equipment. ``Working out is drudgery for a lot of people,'' said
Steve Polevoy, chairman and chief executive of Can Do. ``We want
the exercise experience to be as pleasant as possible for our
members.''
</P>
<P>
   Pleasant, sure, but are distractions the best way to stay
motivated? Users seem to think so. ``I cycle watching CNN and
CNBC,'' said Hunter Martin, a retired lawyer and member of the
Houstonian Spa in Houston. ``When my workout's almost finished, I
often add another 30 minutes so I can keep watching the market
reports.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Davis, a personal trainer at the San Francisco Bay Club,
met with a client recently who despised exercise, but spent three
hours a day surfing the Internet. Now a Netpulse convert, the
client does his daily surfing at the gym instead of at his desk.
</P>
<P>
   Though the machines motivate, they may not always provide the
best workout, some experts and users say. Sherri Balsam, a
21-year-old student who works out at Crunch Fitness in Manhattan,
said that flipping channels on Netpulse's personal televisions made
time go by quickly at the gym, but added that she found that trying
to type while cycling slowed her down.
</P>
<P>
   ``With less focus on what you're doing, the intensity of your
workouts can suffer,'' said Richard Cotton, chief exercise
physiologist for the American Council on Exercise. ``But let's face
it, staring at a wall while you're working out in a gym is boring.
If this will keep people exercising, why not?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; How Pensions Play in Divorce Court &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The expression ``take the money and run'' may resonate well
among working wives who have pensions and are over the age of 45.
These women are more likely to be separated from their husbands
than married women in the same age range who are employed but do
not have pensions, according to a report released by the University
of Michigan Institute for Social Research.
</P>
<P>
   In the first study of the relationship between pension wealth
and marital dissolution, the researchers examined the marital,
pension and employment status of women in 4,219 couples and placed
working wives into three age categories: under 35, 35 to 44, and 45
and over.
</P>
<P>
   They found that 12 percent of pensioned women who were over 45
were separated from their husbands, while only 2 percent of women
that age who were without pensions had experienced marital
dissolution. The differences were less significant for women in the
two other age groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a huge gap between those who do and don't have
pensions in the oldest group,'' said Dr. Hiromi Ono, a sociologist
at the University of Michigan Institute of Social Research and lead
author of the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a very popular idea that when women get their own
resources it leads them to experience marital dissolution. But it's
not that simple a story.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ono said women who had jobs with pensions were likely to be
committed to their careers, and that deep commitments could
sometimes cause unresolvable issues in marriages no matter the age
of the couple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are not leaving their husbands because they got the
money,'' Dr. Ono said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, women weren't playing a major role as
breadwinners and it made sense for wives to drop out of the labor
market,'' she said. ``Today it's much less clear and there can be
conflicts because of it.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ From a helicopter scudding over South Florida, a ribbon
of green farms stretches off to the East. There the avocados and
mangoes are in bloom, tomatoes are green on the vine and field
workers are picking beans. Just beyond are acres and acres of
suburban Miami's characteristic orange-pink roofs.
</P>
<P>
   But directly below, wild nature still holds sway. Or tries to.
</P>
<P>
   What looks like a tawny Western grassland studded by green tree
islands stretches off to the North, West and South. It is the dry
season, and only isolated little pools of water mark the course of
Shark River Slough, a broad but shallow sluice that for 5,000 years
has been the main fresh-water channel through what is now
Everglades National Park.
</P>
<P>
   This winter-and-spring ``dry-down,'' as it is called, is normal.
One of its effects is to concentrate the fish that proliferate
during the summer wet season, and on which the Everglades' famous
wading birds subsist.
</P>
<P>
   The dense concentrations are what fuel the birds' nesting
activities and feed their hatchlings; and as the helicopter
clatters overhead, groups of ibises, wood storks, egrets, anhingas,
herons and a multitude of other species are flocking to the pools.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pristine Everglades,'' said Mike Slayton, the deputy
director of the South Florida Water Management District. It is also
an Everglades in serious decline.
</P>
<P>
   Slow-flowing fresh water is the ecosystem's lifeblood, but less
than half as much of it flows through Shark River Slough today, on
average, as did a century ago. On the whole, water is insufficient
in the Everglades at large, and it often flows to a given place at
the wrong time or in the wrong amount.
</P>
<P>
   So the huge marsh produces far less life than it used to.
Despite the occasional groups of wading birds, the populations that
once were the hallmark of the Everglades have diminished by more
than 90 percent. Ecologists consider this the best single indicator
of the ecosystem's ill health.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason for the decline is that in a successful effort
to supply fresh water to the cities and farms and to protect them
from flooding, people have siphoned off too much of the natural
flow of water that once stretched in a continuous sheet from Lake
Okeechobee in the north to Florida Bay in the south.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of billions of gallons a year are now routinely shunted
out to sea. Levees divide what remains of the sheet flow into a
series of disconnected pools. The result of all this manipulation
is an ecosystem out of kilter.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the nation's most ambitious attempt at ecological
restoration, the federal and state governments are about to try to
put things right. The idea is to spend $8 billion over 20 years to
re-plumb the Everglades' so that natural conditions can be
re-established or at least mimicked.
</P>
<P>
   The latest version of a complex plan to do this, almost six
years in the making, was made public last week and after further
revision is to be delivered to Congress for its consideration on
July 1.
</P>
<P>
   The project, almost six years in the planning, has provoked both
high hopes and high anxiety, and it raises a number of fundamental
questions: Can the unique, world-class natural area really be
restored, given what has been done to it? If so, to what extent?
And will the proposed project do enough?
</P>
<P>
   THE PLAN
</P>
<P>
   Redirecting Water, Finding Hope
</P>
<P>
   No one believes that South Florida can be put back the way it
was before people started altering it about a century ago. For one
thing, about half the area of the original ecosystem has been
converted to urban areas and farms.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmentalists argue that much of the farmland should be
bought out and re-converted to natural areas. But that idea appears
dead politically, and even if it were successfully revived, the
natural system still would not recover its original size.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, South Florida's population of six million is expected
to double over the next half century, and some experts fear that
pressure to develop some of what is left of the Everglades _ and to
appropriate the water _ will only increase.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this cloud on the horizon, the replumbing plan assumes
that the system will remain essentially its present size for the
next 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Based on that assumption, it aims to recapture most of the
billions of gallons of water that now flow to the Atlantic and Gulf
of Mexico each year. This water will be stored in a variety of
reservoirs, including limestone quarries and underground aquifers,
to be redistributed as needed to the Everglades, the farms and the
cities.
</P>
<P>
   The project is intended to deliver the right amount of clean
water to the Everglades at the right place at the right time, in as
natural a manner as possible. The hope is to recreate conditions in
which the Everglades can revive and recover much of their essential
character _ even though in a different and truncated form compared
with the original.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the plan gets us very close'' to that goal, said
Michael L. Davis, an ecologist and deputy assistant secretary of
the Army. He oversees the Army Corps of Engineers, which devised
the plan in cooperation with many federal, state and local agencies
under the over-all aegis of the Interior Department, and he has
been deeply involved in the plan's preparation.
</P>
<P>
   No one claims that the plan is perfect, or ever will be. After
the initial version was made public last October, some scientists
and environmentalists criticized it on grounds that it did not go
far enough in removing the welter of artificial plumbing in which
the system is trussed up, and that it would take too long to gain
results.
</P>
<P>
   It has since been revised after negotiations among the Army
Corps and other groups, notably the National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan in its present form, Davis said, 80 percent of
the water that now goes out to sea would be redirected into the
Everglades. This, he said, would give the Everglades half the total
expanded water supply; now, the farms and cities get 70 percent of
a smaller supply.
</P>
<P>
   In the southern part of Shark River Slough, in the heart of the
national park, the flow would be 90 percent of what computer models
suggest was its historic volume. That should be enough to insure
recovery, said Richard G. Ring, the park superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   In the plan as originally proposed last fall, the restored flow
would have been about 70 percent of the historical volume. Ring and
his staff protested, and after intense talks, the target was
changed.
</P>
<P>
   The additional water will come mostly from treated urban runoff,
and it remains to be seen how successfully that water can be
purified. The planners envision a series of filtering marshes to
remove agricultural runoff and other pollutants from reclaimed
water before it flows into the natural system.
</P>
<P>
   The project also is intended to break down the
compartmentalization of the Everglades somewhat by removing some
levees and canals. The first phase of de-compartmentalization has
been speeded up as a result of the recent talks, and is to be
completed by 2010. In all, roughly two-thirds of the project is to
be finished by then.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics are reserving judgment pending more detailed study.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty encouraged'' by the recent improvements, said
Ring, whose staff scientists have been among the most vocal
critics. ``There is nothing in the plan that's a showstopper'' in
achieving ecological recovery, he said.
</P>
<P>
   THE HISTORY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A `Perfect' System Is Segmented
</P>
<P>
   In the depths of the last ice age some 18,000 years ago, what is
now the Everglades was an open grassland punctuated by oak and
pine. As the climate warmed and South Florida became semi-tropical,
conditions jelled for the formation of a freshwater marsh within a
shallow limestone saucer bounded by low ridges on Florida's east
and west.
</P>
<P>
   The saucer was tilted slightly from north to south, so that the
water in the marsh ran ever so slowly into Florida Bay. Rising seas
helped retard runoff and hold the water in place, and the
Everglades were in place by about the time the Sumerian
civilization rose in Mesopotamia 5,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   One key to the Everglades' ecological character was that the
slow movement of water enabled the system to store enormous amounts
of rainfall from one season to the next. Another key was the
system's huge size and variety of habitats. As water levels rose
and fell between wet and dry seasons, for instance, wading birds
could always move about and find both nesting habitat and food.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last century, the region was gradually covered by a
latticework of levees (one, stretching all the way from Lake
Okeechobee nearly to Florida Bay, protects Florida's east coast
from floods), canals, sluice gates and pumping stations. The far
northern part of the system, where neat green rows of sugar cane
and emerald fields of sod for suburban lawns stretch across the
landscape, was converted to agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   South of this Everglades Agricultural Area, the central part of
the marsh was compartmentalized into five big pools called water
conservation areas. Still farther south is Everglades National Park
itself, the most nearly pristine part of the ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   But the park is at the mercy of water flow from the north. Not
only have the wetlands to the north been diminished, but in some
places, outcroppings of development create backwaters that further
prevent water from flowing south. Since the Everglades north of the
park have been diminished in size much more than the park,
re-establishing the sheet flow into the park would result in a far
narrower flow than was the case historically.
</P>
<P>
   While there is some sheet flow within the divided compartments,
the chopping-up of the system has greatly degraded its ecological
character. For instance, water in some parts of the national park
is too deep for ecological health, while other parts are too dry.
Because of this, for example, the endangered Cape Sable seaside
sparrow has trouble finding suitable habitats.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, levees on the southern edges of compartments cause
``ponding'' as southward-flowing water piles up, while other areas
have become too shallow, and even permanently dry. The marsh soil
in these areas has disintegrated and subsided.
</P>
<P>
   Though the marsh is still extensive, its patchwork pattern
greatly reduces its value to creatures like wading birds, who
become confused about where they can feed and nest, says John C.
Ogden, a Water Management District ecologist. Three or four decades
ago, the Everglades were home to huge ``super colonies'' of nesting
wading birds; today these colonies have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   THE FLOW
</P>
<P>
   Reconnection And Priorities
</P>
<P>
   Since levees, pumps and canals altered the system, they are also
seen by many experts as essential in fixing it. ``This system will
never be a natural system,'' said Dr. Mark Kraus of the National
Audubon Society, which has long been deeply involved in the
restoration. ``You have to keep people dry and put water back into
the system. Water delivery has to be by pumps and canals.''
</P>
<P>
   The general aim, nevertheless, is to keep elaborate engineering
projects on the periphery of the remaining natural area, rather
than inside it. For instance, say advocates of the plan, it will be
necessary to install new pumps, canals and water storage areas just
outside the Everglades, so that water now flowing to the oceans can
be recaptured and pumped, sometimes around obstacles, where it is
needed.
</P>
<P>
   But within the natural area, the goal is to remove as many
artificial structures as possible. More than 240 miles of levees
and canals are to be so eliminated. An important move of this kind
involves the major thoroughfare called Tamiami Trail, which runs
westward out of Miami and divides the national park from the rest
of the natural system to the north.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The highway will be raised and a series of causeways or bridges
will be built, under which water will flow essentially unimpeded
between two of the Everglades' biggest compartments for the first
time in decades. This part of the project is to be completed by
2010.
</P>
<P>
   But experts are divided over the extent to which the historic
sheet flow can and should be re-established. Some believe that the
top priority should be re-establishing the natural depths and
timing of water flows, while others believe that sheet flow itself
should be the top priority.
</P>
<P>
   These goals are not always compatible. For example, if sheet
flow were fully restored, subsidence of the land in some places
would make the water too deep to support much Everglades life.
</P>
<P>
   Also, ponding caused partly by subsidence just northeast of
Tamiami Trail discourages the desire to improve sheet flow by
removing a miles-long major levee to the west. In a recent
compromise, it was decided that a series of notches, or weirs, are
to be cut into the levee through which some water can spill in the
wet season.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, if the subsidence problem can be fixed by filling or
is resolved naturally, the levee can then be removed. (Originally,
the Army Corps proposed to put in more elaborate gates instead of
weirs. Park scientists and others argued successfully that weirs
could be more easily and less expensively removed later, and were a
good interim step.)
</P>
<P>
   Another obstacle is posed by a pocket of homes just east of the
national park that impedes the water flow into Taylor Slough, a
channel on the east side of the park that is the main conduit of
fresh water to Florida Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the bay, some scientists say, has become too salty as a
result of diminished flow from Taylor Slough and is in ecological
decline as a result. A buyout of the homes has been proposed.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Everglades' water flow were perfectly
re-established, that would not complete the work of restoration.
There are the problems of soil loss and subsidence to contend with.
And much of the Everglades has been taken over by exotic plants
from abroad, which are crowding out native species. Some strides
have been made in eliminating one of the most aggressive, the
melaleuca tree.
</P>
<P>
   In a pine-forest island in the Everglades, park scientists have,
after a long period of trial and error simply begun scraping the
land down to bedrock to eliminate another interloper, Brazilian
pepper. Natural vegetation is springing up again, but there is a
long way to go in cleansing the ecosystem of vegetative pollution. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Based on what is known of the Everglades' past and on computer
modeling studies, the scores of specialists most deeply involved in
the restoration project typically express high hopes for the
future, tempered by realities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will never recover the original Everglades,'' Ogden says,
but ``we can make it much healthier than the current system,''
</P>
<P>
   The Future
</P>
<P>
   Optimism And Nervousness
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the experts' optimism is that unlike the
situation in many degraded ecosystems, most of the ecological
pieces of the Everglades are still live there, albeit in reduced
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   In the version of the re-plumbing plan made public last week,
the Army Corps and the Water Management District predict that once
the plan is executed, the abundance of creatures at all levels of
the food web, from minnows and frogs to herons, ibis, otter and
alligators, will increase and return to more natural distribution
patterns.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the effects, the plan predicts, will be seen as early
as a decade from now. About two-thirds of the plan's components
should be in place by then, but other important ones will not be
until about 2020, and some later. Moreover, there is likely to be a
lag between the establishment of a new pattern of flow and the
ecological response.
</P>
<P>
   A big uncertainty in all this is the possible impact of rising
seas. If a warming climate causes the global sea level to rise over
the next few decades as mainstream scientists predict, large areas
of the southern Everglades could be inundated or converted to a
saltwater marsh.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from that, no one knows exactly how the system will
respond to the replumbing; since there is no detailed record of how
the original system functioned, predictions and targets are based
on the computer models. The plan, therefore, is a ``a broad
blueprint and a starting point,'' said Dr. Mark Schaefer, a
biologist who is a deputy assistant secretary of the Interior.
</P>
<P>
   The key to success, he and many others believe, is to remain
flexible so that mid-course corrections can be made. In that sense,
the re-plumbing plan _ and the project itself _ is a perpetual work
in progress.
</P>
<P>
   This has made some environmentalists nervous. They fear that
unless as many details as possible are nailed down now, political
sentiment could change in the future, and urban and agricultural
interests could press for greater advantage at the expense of the
natural system.
</P>
<P>
   Projections call for the population of South Florida to grow
from 6 million to 12 million or more in 50 years, the target period
for the restoration project. All of those people are going to need
housing, and housing will need water that might otherwise go to the
natural system.
</P>
<P>
   ``My greatest fear,'' Mike Slayton, the Water Management
District official, said as the helicopter flew over the sugar cane
fields just north of the Everglades, ``is that the Everglades
Agricultural Area will turn into a bedroom community in 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Ring, the park superintendent, puts it this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we figure out a way that changes how we grow and build,
the built system is going to continue to move into the natural
system.''

FOUR-POSTER BEDS: THE ULTIMATE IN SLEEP COMFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Four-poster beds add an elegant, eye-catching
touch to any bedroom, whether the posts are ornamented with a
fabric tester and fabric curtains or not.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of this style of bed spans three centuries and
continues. Although the bed is now considered decorative and
romantic, its original design was functional.
</P>
<P>
   Before central heating, the four-posters were hung with heavy
silks (curtains) to shield their occupants (from royalty to
presidents) from drafts, as well as to provide a modicum of privacy
to the bed chamber. During the summer and in warm climates, the bed
was draped with netting to keep mosquitoes away.
</P>
<P>
   The four-poster bed is so inviting that it causes some people to
spend more time in bed, whether it be to sleep, breakfast, read or
watch television.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally made from wood, these beds also are made now from
other materials, such as stainless steel and wrought-iron. Styles
range from traditional to contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the turnings, carvings, type of wood or other
material, the four-poster bed can fit a feminine or masculine
decor.
</P>
<P>
   A white provincial four-poster bed draped with frilly or lacy
fabric, or thin stained posts topped with a lace tester (canopy
that is hung on the four posts), is very feminine, compared with
heavy, carved or metal posts, which provide a bolder, more
masculine look.
</P>
<P>
   The posts, which can be smooth, carved or turned or a
combination of all three, are often topped with a slender finial.
</P>
<P>
   It is said that the size of the posts often signaled one's
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   A four-poster bed can be placed against a wall or set
free-standing in the middle of the room, as it is usually the
centerpiece of a bedroom. Placing the bed in the center of the room
was common in earlier centuries, so that one could enjoy the summer
breeze from open windows, as well as the view.
</P>
<P>
   Antique four-posters may rise as high as 12 feet, but today they
are between 5-feet-6-inches and 7 feet from the floor to the top of
the post. Some four-poster beds are so massive that a matching step
stool is needed to get to the mattress.
</P>
<P>
   Prices range from approximately $1,300 to $3,000 for a new queen
size, and hundreds of thousands for an antique four-poster bed in
good condition.

<P>
   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ Among the suffering of Kosovo's ethnic
Albanians, the swiftest and most brutal punch by Serb forces may
have been delivered to some of the 1,400 local employees of the
group allowed to monitor the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Of them, only one has been confirmed dead at the hands of the
Serbs, and some have been identified among the refugees that
streamed out of Kosovo to safety.
</P>
<P>
   But many more are presumed to have been tortured or killed or
both, said officials of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
   The security detail of the team leader, American diplomat
William Walker, and the mission as a whole, had been infiltrated by
at least one Serb operative, said Lt. Col. Michael Philips,
military assistant to Walker. One man employed by the OSCE as a
security agent has since been identified as a subordinate of
Yugoslav warlord Zeljko Razhatovic, the feared paramilitary leader
known as ``Arkan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly fearful that some of the OSCE employees were
identified,'' Philips said. Two of Walker's personal bodyguards
were reported killed by the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   At least one former ethnic Albanian employee who escaped to
Macedonia was severely beaten, had his fingers broken and was
forced to swallow his laminated OSCE identification card, officials
said. The man, Ali Ahmeti, was evacuated with his family to Germany
last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The OSCE's Kosovo Verification Mission was created last fall to
monitor a negotiated truce between Serb forces and the Kosovo
Liberation Army (KLA). The unarmed monitors fled Kosovo in just
before NATO's air campaign against the Serbs began in late March.
</P>
<P>
   Some monitors, against OSCE orders, brought their local
translators and drivers with them when they drove out of Kosovo in
a convoy to Macedonia. But the bulk of the local staff remained
behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of guilt about the way it was handled,'' said an
OSCE field worker who worries about the fate of his landlord after
he heard that the house he rented in the village of Dakovica had
been targeted by Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   Philips said local employees were told to ``stay low and stay
indoors,'' but many may have been easily identified as friends of
the OSCE, vilified by the Serbs as a tool of NATO and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who toured refugee camps in Macedonia on Sunday to the
warm cheers and hugs from refugees, said an armed international
force must enter Kosovo, whether invited or not, to enable the
refugees to return home safely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going back,'' he said at the Stanovac refugee camp near
here. ``Ask any of the refugees (in Skopje) and they'll tell you
we're going back.''

   BLACE, Macedonia _ A week ago it was a torrent, now the flow of
refugees from Kosovo is a trickle.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials and humanitarian relief agencies believe large
numbers of ethnic Albanians still in Kosovo have fled on foot into
the snow-capped mountains along the borders with Albania and
Macedonia to evade Serbian shock troops and find a route to safety.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated and fearful of the consequences of coming out of
hiding, they are struggling against food shortages and frigid
spring rains.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, which is considering food-aid drops over Kosovo to feed
the displaced, says 400,000 or more ethnic Albanians could be
secluded in remote villages or living primitively in the wilderness
along border areas that may have been mined by Serb troops.
</P>
<P>
   Those assessments were backed by evidence Monday when a small
group of Kosovar refugees emerged from hiding and crossed the
border into Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole village was living in the mountains,'' said Kefsere
Nebiu, 32, a mother of four who were among the 360 refugees who
crossed the Blace checkpoint to safety in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees, many from the Kosovo town of Urosevac, about 25
miles south of the provincial capital of Pristina, recounted
similar experiences. Two weeks ago, Serbian army, police and
paramilitary forces entered the town and began a systematic forced
evacuation similar to those reported across Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told us, 'As soon as you leave, we will burn down your
house,''' said Nurije Hysenajzi, 21.
</P>
<P>
   Many families fled into the mountains to the small village of
Sejevo about one mile away. There, they took shelter with friends
and family until last week when Serb forces entered with three
tanks and proceeded to empty the village.
</P>
<P>
   Nebiu said her husband's elderly and frail parents were shot to
death by Serb troops in their home after being ordered to leave.
The couple were unable to move without assistance. Nebiu believes
Serb troops may have thought the couple was disobeying the command
to evacuate the house.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 people in all fled to the woods, mothers
wrapping their babies in woolen sweaters and children carrying as
much of the families belongings as they could.
</P>
<P>
   For several days, the older men remained at the edge of the
forest, waiting to see if they could return to the village. Most
nights, Serb forces apparently fearful of NATO air attacks, would
themselves go into hiding, allowing the villagers to return to find
shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the day we would hide in the mountains, and then we
would come back to the houses at night,'' said Gezim Osmani, 16.
</P>
<P>
   Believing there was safety in numbers, 50 to 60 people would
sleep in a single house. But occasionally hearing gunfire, they
would again flee into the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was cold and raining. There was nothing to eat. We would
share small pieces of bread,'' said Hisnije Mani, 38, who fled with
her husband Rahman, a laborer, three of their children and Rahman's
80-year-old partially paralyzed mother.
</P>
<P>
   After several days, the Serb troops flushed out those hiding in
the village. People still in the woods decided to take their
chances and make their way back to the larger town of Urosevac,
parts of which had been burned and leveled. There, Serb officials
allowed them to board a train for the Macedonian border; but they
had to buy their own tickets -- about $7 per person.
</P>
<P>
   The accounts cannot be independently verified, as Kosovo is
closed to most international journalists and aid workers.
</P>
<P>
   But the stories appear to confirm the fears of NATO and U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) relief officials who believe
the refugees remaining in Kosovo face more desperate and dangerous
conditions than those who fled in the mass exoduses? during the
first two weeks of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear there are a lot of people in the woods, but so far we
haven't seen many of them come out,'' said Francis Teoh(CQ), a
UNHCR field worker on the northern Macedonian border with
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers in the Macedonian hills above the Blace border
crossing said some 2,000 Kosovo refugees were living in the woods
along the border about 10 days ago. They were fed and given
blankets by the residents of the village of Gorno-Blace. But after
two days, they were turned back into Kosovo by Macedonian police
who insisted they had to cross at the official border checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were scared, like they were already dead,'' said Minir
Bardhi, 23. ``They said, 'Better to kill us here (Gorno-Blace) than
to send us back to Kosovo.'''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In a separate incident, Macedonian state television reported
over the weekend that police had discovered the bodies of a young
mother and her baby who had apparently died of hypothermia while
crossing the border over a remote mountain pass.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has considered dropping food, medicines and other supplies
from the air in the hopes of reaching displaced people still in
Kosovo. But NATO planes would have to fly at high altitude to avoid
Serb anti-aircraft fire from the ground, increasing the chances
that the food and supplies could fall into the hands of Serbian
forces instead of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Relief officials also suspect that the refugees are on the move
to avoid being tracked down by Serb forces, making it difficult to
target air drops of food and aid.
</P>
<P>
   The UNHCR estimates that as many as 1 million people, the vast
majority of them ethnic Albanians, are unaccounted for in Kosovo
since Serb forces stepped up their siege and NATO began its air
assault on Yugoslavia on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo province is home to some 1.8 million ethnic
Albanians. Most refugees have fled to neighboring Albania, which
has accepted some 310,000. About 118,000 have fled to Macedonia and
63,000 to the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro.

   WASHINGTON _ Just after the downing of an F-117 stealth fighter
over Yugoslavia on March 27, Pentagon officials played down
suggestions that Russia might now be able to catch up on stealth
technology. Now, more than two weeks after the plane went down, the
verdict is mixed. Some leading aerospace experts say the wreckage
of the radar-evading fighter could help Russian scientists learn
how the F-117 Nighthawk is produced and how radar systems can track
it. Others say the technology is too dated to do the Russians much
good. By MICHAEL D. TOWLE. Story will move in ``w'' Washington

TBS OFFERS TELLING LOOK AT GREAT NAVAL BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the sea battle lost, what's left of the United States'
naval forces retreat east, unable to defend much of the Pacific
Ocean. Concentrating on its own West Coast border, American
resources otherwise available for the war in Europe are held back.
</P>
<P>
   The Normandy invasion is forestalled by years, if it happens at
all.
</P>
<P>
   It could have happened if events went another way one day in
1942, a day that set the course for the rest of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Conjecture? Not too much. Exaggeration? No. You can't
overestimate the impact of Midway.
</P>
<P>
   The Battle for Midway, on June 4, 1942, pitted American against
Japanese naval forces that clashed in the sea and air over a spit
of coral and sand 1,000 miles from nowhere. Despite facing a more
experienced Japanese fleet _ the same ships that attacked Pearl
Harbor six months before _ the American seamen and aviators won the
day in the most pivotal battle of the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   ``We helped to avenge Pearl Harbor,'' said Pete Montalvo, 74, of
Saratoga Springs, N.Y., who was a seaman second class on the USS
Yorktown, an ill-fated carrier. ``We got back at them.''
</P>
<P>
   Four Japanese carriers were lost as was the Yorktown. It was
arguably the greatest naval battle of all time, one that cost
thousands of lives, decimated the Japanese fleet and paved the way
for the Allies' push in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Battle for Midway,'' a National Geographic special airing
Wednesday at 8:05 (Eastern) on TBS, is two stories separated by 56
years but linked by that one day. The tales are told in alternating
fashion, yesterday and today and back, the recollections of old men
who were kids forced to mature beyond their years.
</P>
<P>
   Narrated by Peter Coyote, both are stirring tales. One is of the
fight for the fate of the free world. The other is of the search,
for the benefit of history and the men who survived the battle.
</P>
<P>
   The first is the story of the battle, captured in stirring color
at the time by no less than legendary director John Ford (``The
Grapes of Wrath,'' ``The Quiet Man,'' ``The Man Who Shot Liberty
Valance,'' among more than 100 others). Ford, who was making
propaganda films for the military, took mind-boggling risks to
chronicle the battle.
</P>
<P>
   The other tale is the 1998 search for the Yorktown and Japanese
carrier Kaga, an expedition underwritten and filmed by the National
Geographic Society and led by Dr. Robert D. Ballard, the deep sea
explorer who discovered the Titanic and the sunken German ship
Bismarck.
</P>
<P>
   Ballard's expedition included four survivors of the battle, two
Japanese and two Americans. In the end the Yorktown would be found,
more than 16,000 feet down. The Kaga would not. As Ballard notes
about searching for sunken ships, sometimes Neptune lets you in,
sometimes he doesn't. When you add the emotional component of going
with survivors on such an expedition, a new dynamic enters an
exercise of science tinged with tradition and a trace of
superstition.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you do these things and you are going to a place where
people died, and then when you bring survivors ... it is always a
conflicting feeling,'' Ballard said. ``You are trying to find these
ships. There is a part of you that is very happy. That is in direct
conflict with their feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Bill Surgi, one of the two American veterans to make the
trek, the tears shed were also of pride, respect and duty, in
addition to sadness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a nostalgia-plus trip for me,'' Surgi, now retired in
Rockville, Md., said in an interview. ``I was the only one selected
from the Yorktown to go. That made me feel I was representing the
crew.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yorktown fought as well as it could. Damaged in May in the
Battle of the Coral Sea that saved Australia, the ship went in for
three months of repairs. Needed at Midway, the carrier was instead
patched up in three days and sent back into battle.
</P>
<P>
   At Midway, she was hit by one wave of Japanese bombers, but
stayed afloat. A second attack left her listing; the order was
given to abandon ship. Still, the Yorktown struggled to stay up. It
was being towed when a Japanese sub finished her off.
</P>
<P>
   ``She died hard,'' Surgi said. ``She didn't want to give up.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did the men on board and neither did Ballard.

BROADWAY'S `ICEMAN' MOMENTARY UNCLOGS AMERICA'S PIPE DREAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JEFFREY ERIC JENKINS  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Before a word is spoken, before an actor is seen,
there is the soft tinkling of a player piano. The music, by the
prolific theater composer Paddy Cunneen, seems both vaguely
familiar and somehow distant.
</P>
<P>
   It is an opening appropriate to Howard Davies' revival of ``The
Iceman Cometh'' by Eugene O'Neill, which opened Thursday night on
Broadway. It will be at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre through June
26. (Tickets: $50-$100, 800-755-4000.)
</P>
<P>
   Each generation seeks its defining moments on the stage. In
1956, actor Jason Robards and director Jose Quintero resurrected
the reputation of O'Neill with their productions of ``The Iceman
Cometh'' and ``Long Day's Journey into Night.'' Their success
forced a posthumous rethinking of the only American playwright to
win the Nobel Prize for Literature. O'Neill was honored in 1936,
three years before he wrote his masterworks.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Kevin Spacey, Tony and Academy Award winner,
strides confidently into the dingy, besotted world of Harry Hope's
Saloon playing the central role of Hickey.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill's work is familiar turf for the tightly wound,
charismatic Spacey, who played the dissolute Jamie in a 1986
Broadway production of ``Long Day's Journey.''
</P>
<P>
   Filled with well-crafted performances by its star-studded
ensemble _ Tony Danza, Robert Sean Leonard and rising film actor
Paul Giamatti among them _ Davies' ``Iceman'' never manages the
tragic heft of Broadway's current ``Death of a Salesman'' by Arthur
Miller. While the two plays may appear to focus on different
themes, each is still concerned with what Tennessee Williams called
``illusion that has the appearance of truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The denizens of this ``Bottom of the Sea Rathskellar'' gradually
rouse themselves from various forms of stupor to anticipate
Hickey's arrival. Scattered about on designer Bob Crowley's
handsomely evocative brick rotunda and antique bar set, these
losers spin ``pipe dreams'' of what tomorrow will bring _
employment, marriage, respectability.
</P>
<P>
   But for today, all that's important is Hickey's arrival _ with
his pockets filled with cash _ to celebrate proprietor Harry Hope's
(James Hazeldine) birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Although set in the 1912 of his youth, O'Neill wrote the play in
1939 as European war grew along with his own despair over what the
world faced. Still escaping from the Great Depression that year,
President Roosevelt declared the United States neutral in the face
of overseas conflict (proving that you needn't be a tart or a drunk
to indulge in pipe dreams).
</P>
<P>
   In ``Iceman,'' hardware salesman Hickey lands on Harry's
clientele like an evangelist on speed. With this visit to his
bibulous buddies, he's selling something and he's determined that
everyone buy. Peddling hardware to a bunch of drunks? No way.
Hickey's seen the light, he's been released from his own pipe
dreams, and he wants to release the others.
</P>
<P>
   With an edgy glint in his eye, Spacey's Hickey unnerves his old
pals. Something's different about him. But, hey, maybe it's just
another one of his gags; like the one about his wife fooling around
with the iceman. As the 4{-hour drama unwinds, though, we realize
that what Hickey has planned is no joke.
</P>
<P>
   One by one he convinces the others to cut through their
illusions and face reality in ways that are often painful and
occasionally humorous to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Pigott-Smith gives a taut performance as the jaded former
anarchist Larry, who resists Hickey's manic charms almost to the
end. Michael Emerson is superb as Willie Oban, an Ivy League
failure who is eclipsed by his father's shadow.
</P>
<P>
   Danza gratifies as the bartender who's convinced he's not a pimp
because he slaps his girls instead of beating them. Leonard is
suitable as the young man who betrays a political movement and,
consequently, his mother. But when the young man seeks answers from
Larry, he finds Hickey fervently selling``truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Betrayal is on the periphery and at the core of ``Iceman.''
There is even a party scene, complete with a Judas, that echoes the
Last Supper. Political, matriarchal and spousal betrayals are what
drive both Hickey and the boy to destruction. The boy is convinced
to cast away his illusions and embrace his own death.
</P>
<P>
   But Hickey? When faced with his own ultimate choice of truth or
illusion, he shifts gears and drops his crusade. In doing so, he
releases himself and us from the true image in the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Then it's ``bottoms up'' and ``wait 'til tomorrow'' as we sink
back into our boozy haze.

 THE POOR GET POORER; THE RICH GET SUVs  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The folowing quotations are from news stories
that have appeared since January. The italicized paragraphs are
from ``Shifting Fortunes: The Perils of the Growing American Wealth
Gap,'' published by the Boston-based organization, United for a
Fair Economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington, D.C _ Hundreds of thousands of America's children
are suffering from disease, hunger, serious injury and educational
failure from living in substandard shelter, says a new nationwide
report ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Among the key findings of the report: 21,000 children have
stunted growth and 120,000 suffer from anemia because their
families must choose between food and rent; 10,000 children between
the ages of 4 and 9 are hospitalized for asthma attacks each year
because of cockroach infestation at home.''
</P>
<P>
   (Italics) In its 1998 survey of 30 major cities, the U.S.
Conference of Mayors found that requests for emergency shelter by
homeless families had risen 15 percent during the past year; 30
percent of the requests went unmet. The mayors also found that more
than one-fifth of the urban homeless were employed. ... The
American Journal of Public Health reported in 1998 that 10 million
Americans _ including more than four million children _ do not have
enough to eat. The majority are in families with at least one
employed person.
</P>
<P>
   For the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, 1999, the mortgage (tax)
deduction will add up to about $53.7 billion. That's $23 billion
more than the total 1998 federal spending by the Department of
Housing and Urban Development. (Italics)
</P>
<P>
   ``New York _ Stocks rallied to new highs, with the Dow Jones
industrial average closing above 10,000 for the second time in
history after the latest jobs report showed the economy may be
slowing enough to keep the Federal Reserve from raising interest
rates.''
</P>
<P>
   (Italics) Between 1983 and 1995, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index
delivered a huge cumulative return of 582 percent (with dividends
reinvested). At the same time, the median household net worth
dropped 11 percent. . . . Less than one-third of households (29
percent) owned stock worth more than $5,000 in 1995. Almost 90
percent of the value of all stocks and mutual funds owned by
households was in the hands of the top 10 percent. (Italics)
</P>
<P>
   ``Traders were buoyed by a Labor Department report that just
46,000 new jobs were created in February, the smallest increase in
three years. The report calmed investor fears that the economy was
growing too fast and that the Federal Reserve might raise interest
rates to slow it down.''
</P>
<P>
   (Italics) Hourly wages for average workers in 1998 were 6.2
percent below 1973, adjusting for inflation; weekly wages were 12
percent lower than in 1973. (Italics) The average worker worked 148
more hours in 1996 than their 1973 counterpart; that's equivalent
to nearly four weeks longer.
</P>
<P>
   The average CEO in Business Week's annual survey made 326 times
the pay of factory workers in 1997 . . . compared to 1980, when
CEOs made 42 times as much. (Italics)
</P>
<P>
   ``New York _ America Online Inc. announced it will cut up to 20
percent of Netscape's staff, or up to 500 workers, as it absorbs
the pioneering software maker in a $10 billion acquisition. ...
(The cuts) should hit such back-office operations as accounting but
will largely leave alone Netscape's coveted group of 550 software
developers and managers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston _ BankBoston Corp. and Fleet Financial Group announced
they will merge in a $16 billion stock deal that creates a regional
powerhouse in the consolidating U.S. banking industry. ... The
merger would create an institution with $180 billion in assets and
20 million customers but also would result in the loss of more than
4,500 jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   (Italics) The U.S. personal savings rate has fallen from 8.6
percent in 1984 to 2.1 percent in 1997 and 0.5 percent in 1998.
Debt as a percentage of personal income rose from 58 percent in
1973 to 76 percent in 1989 to an estimated 85 percent in 1997. ...
Total credit card debt soared from $243 billion in 1990 to $560
billion in 1997. ... As of 1997, almost 60 percent of all American

 &HT;    Writers, friends pay tribute to Eudora Welty at 90
 &HT;    By Bo Emerson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eudora Welty is 90 today, and among the many publications
lighting candles on her cake is The Georgia Review ($7), which
offers brief accolades from such literary lions as Reynolds Price
and Alice Munro, as well as one of the earliest of the Mississippi
writer's stories. Welty's ``The Doll'' is reprinted for the first
time since it appeared in June 1936, in the Tanager, a literary
bimonthly from Grinnell College in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO EU: Another very personal tribute to Welty
comes from Southern writer Willie Morris, who was born in a house
in the Belhaven section of Jackson, Miss., two blocks from Welty's
home. The two have been friends since Morris was in grammar school,
so we're not surprised that he gets what others don't: an
interview. Writing in Vanity Fair ($3.95), Morris shares a glass of
Maker's Mark with the Divine Miss W., and traces his long
acquaintance with a woman he says ``many consider America's
greatest living writer.''

your poor men on their poor mules and send them home. This army is
hopelessly whipped.'' Lee disagreed, and continued flying to the
west, toward his fate at Appomattox. Forbes American Heritage

 &HT;    No `Muskrat Love,' but `Victoria' has Alabama accent
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who turned on a radio or a TV set in the '70s couldn't
miss Toni Tennille, the perky blond half of the decade's hot pop
duo, the Captain &AMP; Tennille. The married couple came out of nowhere
in 1975 to score the top-selling song of the year, ``Love Will Keep
Us Together,'' which copped them a weekly TV variety series and pop
stardom.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Captain (a.k.a. Daryl Dragon) and Tennille went on to
sell 23 million records with vintage, shag-hair hits such as ``Do
That to Me One More Time,'' ``Muskrat Love'' and ``The Way I Want
to Touch You,'' their time on the charts ended just as the decade
did.
</P>
<P>
   Tennille, however, hasn't faded into pop-star obscurity.
Tonight, she arrives in Atlanta for a six-day run in the national
touring production of ``Victor/Victoria,'' the musical that starred
Julie Andrews on Broadway and in which Tennille has been starring
since September 1998. We caught up with her in Cincinnati and
chatted, while the Captain tinkered with his new computer in the
background.
</P>
<P>
   People are inevitably going to compare your performance to Julie
Andrews'. What's the difference?
</P>
<P>
   A:Julie is an English soprano, and that's the way the
</P>
<P>
   show was written. I'm playing Victoria as an Alabama contralto,
because that's what I am. So references that are normally to places
in England now refer to places in Alabama and the South. The accent
I use suggests a Southern thing, but it's not as thick as the one I
grew up with. If I used that, they wouldn't understand me in
Northern cities. Victor obviously can't be Southern, so I have a
continental accent for him.
</P>
<P>
   How hard is it for you to play a male for half the night?
</P>
<P>
   A:My physicality is quite different from Julie's. I'm very tall,
5-feet-11, and pretty small-busted. Julie was generously endowed.
She had to wear a compressor, but I don't have to. I tried it on
once in New York, and said, ``I can't sing in this!'' It's this
flesh-colored, really tight spandex bandage thing. You can't
breathe.
</P>
<P>
   What do you think of when you think about Atlanta?
</P>
<P>
   A:I remember climbing Stone Mountain when I was in my teens. I
sang with the symphony about 14 years ago at Chastain (Park
amphitheater). I remember it's impossible to find your way around.
Everything is named Peachtree, and the streets are not on a grid. I
usually get a rental car, but we're going to keep a limo on call
there because I don't want to drive. What I'm really looking
forward to this time is a busload of gals from Montgomery(,
Alabama) I haven't seen since junior high school are coming to the
show Thursday night. It's going to be a hoot to see these women.
One gal I actually went to kindergarten with at Miss Margaret
Booth's School for Girls.

 &HT;    FOR NATO, ANOTHER HUMANITARIAN CRISIS: HOW TO AID STARVING
ETHNIC ALBANIANS STUCK IN KOSOVO
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-CONGRESS-O413; KOSOVO-MONITORS-0413.
 &HT;    By SCOTT MONTGOMERY 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hundreds of thousands of Kosovar Albanians who
escaped the brutal sweeps of Serb military forces by fleeing to the
cold mountains and forests of Kosovo have now been in hiding for
more than two weeks, and allied officials said Monday that they
fear an even larger humanitarian disaster is brewing beyond their
reach.
</P>
<P>
   The crush of Kosovars overwhelming the borders of the
neighboring countries of Albania, Macedonia -- as well as the
Yugoslav state of Montenegro -- has all but stopped in recent days,
with the U.N. High Commission on Refugees (UNHCR) reporting only
about 4,000 crossed into Albania over the weekend. And Pentagon
officials said Monday adequate food and shelter has been provided
for ``most of the refugees around the periphery'' of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as we deal with one humanitarian challenge, we also are
aware that there is another dramatic one, the one inside Kosovo
itself,'' NATO Secretary General Javier Solana told reporters in
Brussels. ``We are deeply concerned with the fate of all the
displaced peoples there in Kosovo who, as you know, are facing
hunger and exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another major humanitarian crisis in the making, and
we are urgently considering whether there are ways in which we
might be able to help.''
</P>
<P>
   But this new refugee problem seems more vexing than the last.
</P>
<P>
   Serb military forces and paramilitary gangs control the ground
in Kosovo, Serbia's southern province, making it difficult even to
estimate the size of the refugee crisis. Most journalists and
relief workers were expelled in the early days of the NATO
campaign, so information has primarily been anecdotal, provided
sporadically by those few who are left.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, following a NATO meeting on Monday, Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright blamed the Yugoslav government headed by
President Slobodan Milosevic for generating yet another crisis for
humanity. But she was forced to rely on guesswork in talking about
its scope.
</P>
<P>
   ``True to form, Belgrade is taking every opportunity to make a
bad situation worse,'' Albright said from NATO headquarters.
``We're deeply concerned that as many as 700,000 people are at risk
within Kosovo. It appears that Belgrade is deliberately depriving
them of food and shelter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these people are allowed to die, we will hold the Serb
authorities accountable,'' she warned.
</P>
<P>
   But the more pointed problem NATO faces in dealing with the
possibility of mass starvation is that Serb military units are
still too dangerous to get close to. Throughout the campaign, now
going into its 21st day, NATO air strikes have sought to isolate
Serb ground forces in Kosovo province by targeting supply lines.
</P>
<P>
   And while Pentagon officials say satellite photographs suggest
the strategy is working because Serb units have become less mobile,
they remain well-equipped.
</P>
<P>
   Army Lt. Col. Bill Darley at the Pentagon said arranging an
airlift to drop food already has been discussed and scratched.
Unlike high-altitude bombers or ultra-fast F-16 fighter jets, cargo
planes carrying food would provide easy targets by flying low and
slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``To do that we have to have air dominance,'' Darley said.
``First of all you worry about getting it to the people you intend
it for. And, of course, you want your airframe to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Darley called food drops an ``inexact science,'' and said NATO
wants to avoid fortifying Serb troops. But he also stressed that
since the humanitarian issue was the driving force behind NATO's
military action a high priority has been placed on assessing the
situation within Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be that we have massive starvation in Kosovo,'' he
said. ``We don't know.''

 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cancer was once thought to be a single disease that
attacked different tissues. Then it was recognized to be a hundred
different diseases as determined by the particular tissue involved
and the kind of cells within that tissue that were growing out of
control.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the sophisticated techniques of a burgeoning field called
molecular pathology are suggesting that cancer comes in countless
variations, each with a genetically determined molecular
fingerprint that indicates how deadly or indolent it is likely to
be and how aggressively it should be treated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably a million cancers, maybe as many as there
are patients with cancer,'' said Dr. Carlos Cordon-Cardo, director
of the division of molecular pathology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center in New York. ``While there will be some garden
varieties, we need to look at cancer as an individualized disease
and develop individual treatment protocols for patients with
different molecular profiles.''
</P>
<P>
   Cordon-Cardo, whose interest in pathology dates from his
boyhood, is a leader among researchers hoping to use molecular
pathology to transform the treatment of many cancers, increasing
patients' chances of cure in some cases and avoiding unnecessary
treatment in others. It is a hot field that is already beginning to
alter the treatment of some common cancers, including breast
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Molecular pathology will revolutionize our approach to cancer
diagnosis and treatment,'' said Dr. Richard Klausner, director of
the National Cancer Institute. ``We've been looking at cancer cells
under the microscope for 100 years. We now know it's not the
appearance of these cells but their molecular instructions that
determine how a tumor will behave.'' He said the task of the next
three to five years would be to determine which of the 50,000 genes
that define a cancer cell were relevant to prognosis and treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The new attention is welcome to Cordon-Cardo, who enjoys
teaching lay audiences about the molecular determinants of the
disease that has been the focus of his life's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two tumors may look identical under the microscope, yet one
may go on for years without spreading and the other might kill the
patient in a few years,'' he said. By linking different molecular
markers with degrees of aggressiveness, it should be possible to
tailor treatment to maximize the chance for a cure in patients with
more virulent cancers and minimize the trauma of treatment for
those with less aggressive cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Already, researchers have discovered that cancers have types
just the way blood does, but only more of them. Analyses of the
genetic characteristics of tumors has already begun to transform
the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of some cancers and is
expected to radically alter treatment decisions for many other
cancers in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
   For example, researchers have discovered that 30 percent of
breast cancers produce unusually high amounts of a marker protein
called HER-2/neu, which renders them particularly ferocious.
Researchers developed a designer drug called Herceptin that
interferes with the marker protein and helps to control advanced
breast cancer. The drug is now being tested against less advanced
breast cancers as well as the 20 percent of ovarian cancers and
some prostate cancers that produce too much of the protein.
</P>
<P>
   Another success story involves the estrogen-receptor marker in
breast cancer and the consequent use of the antiestrogen tamoxifen
to reduce both the risk of recurrence and the development of a
second cancer in the opposite breast. Molecular markers are also
being used successfully to make treatment decisions in childhood
leukemia and colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The findings that are emerging almost weekly from molecular
pathology laboratories are leading many to dismiss the notion that
a single ``magic bullet'' would one day be found to cure all
cancers.
</P>
<P>
   While that may sound like bad news, Cordon-Cardo and others say
the new findings are among the most hopeful developments in cancer
research. They hold the promise of leading to new and more specific
tools for early detection and for choosing treatment regimens that
are just potent enough to eradicate a cancer but not any more
powerful than necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Through an understanding of a tumor's molecular fingerprints,
Cordon-Cardo explained, it should be possible to avoid using the
therapeutic equivalent of a sledgehammer to kill an ant when the
cancer being treated is not particularly virulent. In other cases,
when a tumor has fingerprints that indicate it is highly
aggressive, oncologists may be able to tell in advance that they
must throw the therapeutic book at it.
</P>
<P>
   For example, prostate cancers vary greatly in their virulence,
but doctors are unable to say for sure who will do well with
minimal treatment and who will die without radical surgery or other
aggressive therapies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Molecular signatures will allow us to identify tumors that are
insensitive to a particular form of treatment from the get-go,''
Cordon-Cardo said. ``Some of the genes we're studying will help us
know in advance of treatment how certain drugs will impact
tumors.'' Just as antibiotics are chosen based on the sensitivity
of bacteria, chemotherapy or other therapies could be
individualized depending upon the sensitivities of the cancer cells
as determined by their molecular markers.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, if the enzyme thymidylate synthase is increased
in production in colon cancer cells, the standard drug 5-FU will
not help because the cells are resistant to it,'' Cordon-Cardo
said, citing studies by Dr. Joseph Bertino at Memorial. ``There are
quite a number of patients now being treated with 5-FU who may not
be helped by it.'' Studies are now under way to determine if every
patient with colon cancer should be tested for this marker before
starting on 5-FU.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a study published in January in the Journal of Urology, Dr.
Harry Herr and other colleagues of Cordon-Cardo's reported that
chemotherapy and not surgical removal of the bladder might be all
that is needed to cure patients with bladder cancer whose cancers
are confined to the bladder and who lack detectable levels of an
important marker protein called p53. All 16 patients in the study
who met these criteria were still alive a decade after treatment
that preserved their bladders. On the other hand, those with tumors
that expressed p53 responded best if their bladders were removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the point where organ preservation in cancer
treatment is an important quality-of-life issue, and these kinds of
tumor markers can help us determine when we can avoid removing an
organ,'' Cordon-Cardo said.
</P>
<P>
   P53 is a protein produced by a tumor suppressor gene that can
have hundreds of different mutations, some of which are worse than
others. ``By testing for p53 mutations, we can tell which patients
with such cancers as bladder, colon, breast and lung will do poorly
and who won't respond to certain treatments,'' Cordon-Cardo said.
</P>
<P>
   Also highly promising are studies of a protein called p27, which
seems to play an important role in controlling the growth of many
cancers. Studies in Boston, Seattle, Toronto, England and Japan
have linked abnormally low levels of the p27 protein to aggressive
cancers of the breast, colon, lung, esophagus and tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Studies by Cordon-Cardo and colleagues indicate that p27 tests
may help clinicians determine which prostate cancers are likely to
be deadly and thus warrant aggressive treatment and which ones can
be controlled with less treatment or perhaps none at all. He
explained that p27 acts like a brake that keeps cell growth in
check. When levels of this protein are low or absent, cells are
likely to proliferate rapidly. Rapid cell growth, in turn,
increases the chances of genetic mutations that may allow a cancer
to develop and grow unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   Another highly promising approach to have grown out of
immunopathology and molecular pathology is the development and use
of tumor vaccines to attack the abnormal proteins in cancer cells.
Several such vaccines are beginning to be tested in patients,
Cordon-Cardo said. For example, he and others at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering have devised vaccines to boost the body's immune
response to melanomas and neuroblastomas. The researchers inject
molecules called gangliosides that spark the immune system into
attacking similar molecules they have identified on the membranes
of the tumor cells.
</P>
<P>
   The achievements Cordon-Cardo and his colleagues are now forging
were unimaginable when as a 10-year-old boy in Barcelona, Spain, he
asked for a microscope for his birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandmother, who lived with us, set up a corner of the
house for me as a laboratory,'' he recalled. ``I knew by age 17
that I wanted to study the basis of cancer, that I wanted to be a
pathologist rather than a clinician. My mentor in medical school,
Professor Lorenzo Galindo, spent 25 years in the United States and
Puerto Rico and introduced surgical pathology to Spain. He told me
I had to learn English and go to the United States to study.''
</P>
<P>
   A special fellowship from the Spanish government enabled him to
get a Ph.D. in cell biology and genetics at Cornell University
Medical School. Then Memorial Sloan-Kettering asked him to stay on,
giving him a small laboratory to do immunopathology, developing and
characterizing antibodies that could help determine what biological
changes allow a normal cell to become an immortal cancer cell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within 15 years, we grew from a very small laboratory to a
couple of laboratories to a division which now has 45 people,''
Cordon-Cardo said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a technological revolution has begun offering
molecular pathologists the ability to automatically analyze gene
sequences in DNA obtained from just a few cells, enabling them to
identify different fingerprints and mutations quickly. Using
microchip technology, it is now possible to analyze thousands of
genes or DNA sequences simultaneously to get genetic profiles of
individual cancers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must follow the revolution in technology or you fall
behind,'' said Cordon-Cardo, a technology buff who enjoys applying
new technologies to clinical situations. ``Cancers usually have
hundreds of mutations, most of which are silent and some of which
are very aggressive,'' he said. ``The trick is to figure out what
is really important among the background noise _ which mutations
allow a cell to escape the normal controls of proliferation and
death and become immortal inside a mortal body.''
</P>
<P>
   But this is not work one researcher can do alone, he said. ``My
life is a life of collaboration.'' Among his colleagues are
molecular biologists who identify genes and their mutations,
crystallographers who study the structure of molecules,
immunologists who devise ways of stimulating immune responses to
cancer, developmental pharmacologists who engineer new drugs and
clinicians who care for patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next step will be to make sure all these efforts by so
many workers are not wasted,'' he said. ``The discoveries in the
laboratory must be brought into clinical practice to enhance the
management of patients.''

TAX TALES

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This is the week Americans love to hate _ our
income tax returns are due. Inevitable but ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, the annual deadline April 15 has provided
politicians with a golden opportunity to demonstrate easy empathy
with constituents by demanding tax cuts in one form or another. The
Republicans in particular have made this issue a priority ever
since it swept Ronald Reagan into the White House nearly two
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative GOP members of Congress even tried last year to
wipe out the tax code altogether as a means of forcing Congress to
replace it with an unspecified alternative. Although fortunately
this reckless scheme went nowhere, it dramatically illustrated the
intensity of antitax feeling in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this spring the unusual is happening. Voters don't seem to
care much about getting a fat new tax cut, according to the polls
and political analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally none of us would turn down a tax reduction. We're not
stupid.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other things that seem more important these days
on the public agenda, from spending the projected federal surplus
to protect Social Security and Medicare to using it for
improvements in education.
</P>
<P>
   All the potential 2000 Republican presidential candidates are
promising tax cuts anyway, some of them stressing an
across-the-board slash of 10 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic heir-apparent, Vice President Al Gore, supports
narrowly aimed tax cuts along lines already backed by President
Clinton, such as eliminating the marriage penalty. That particular
inequity as well as some others have been targeted by Republicans
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Publishing heir Malcolm S. ``Steve'' Forbes made his mark in his
first presidential campaign in 1996 largely by crusading for a 17
percent flat tax.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is still around and Forbes still talks about it in his
current presidential campaign. But he has expanded his political
repertory to include other issues that have more resonance. The
flat tax had the appeal of simplicity, but it was also
conspicuously unfair, giving rich folks like Forbes an enormous tax
break and draining the federal treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the GOP presidential frontrunner, is
thus far as ambiguous on the subject of across-the-board tax cuts
as he is on just about everything else. Perhaps he remembers his
father's mistake in proclaiming: ``Read my lips; no new taxes'' _ a
rash commitment for which the elder Bush paid a heavy political
penalty when he later was forced to ignore it.
</P>
<P>
   But there may be a clue to the younger Bush's thinking in the
fact that his chief economic policy adviser, Lawrence Lindsey,
recently championed a 10 percent across-the-board income tax cut as
an essential economic stimulus.
</P>
<P>
   Whether a massive, untargeted tax cut is indeed necessary or
might in fact be harmful in today's flush economy is a subject of
much dispute among experts. Ordinary taxpayers can pick and choose
among the arguments. Statistics can be manipulated to suit
ideologies. Who knows which of competing economic assumptions are
accurate?
</P>
<P>
   But what really matters politically is whether voters feel
excessively and unfairly pinched by the tax system.
</P>
<P>
   And apparently _ for the moment at least _ they do not.
</P>
<P>
   It has helped that not long ago Congress held hearings into
Internal Revenue Service abuses and subsequently instituted
bipartisan reforms. Some civility has been imposed on the process.
Some professional concern for taxpayers' rights has been
acknowledged. And some simplicity in the forms may be on the way.
</P>
<P>
   It's still a painful thing to pay taxes, but we know we can't
legally avoid it.
</P>
<P>
   Taxes have already been reduced in recent years by presidential
and congressional initiatives focusing on ordinary folks. In 1997,
a new child tax credit was passed. Estate taxes have been reduced,
and breaks for education are in the works.
</P>
<P>
   The prosperous economy has also lifted most boats, and the boat
owners are not inclined to rock them. When Reagan popularized tax
cuts in 1980, inflation was in the double digits, unemployment was
high and the economy was in bad shape. That is not true now. It is
difficult to make a case that something as drastic as a major tax
cut that would primarily help the rich is required to keep
middle-class boats afloat.
</P>
<P>
   With his unerring instinct for pandering to the rich, House
Majority Leader Richard Armey, R-Texas, has produced a Web site
espousing the flat 17 percent income tax. He says Americans will be
better off ``if the (federal budget) surpluses were returned to
them rather than squandered by the federal government.'' Armey's
problem is that most Americans don't think spending for Social
Security, Medicare and essential public services is squandering.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the income tax will never be a dead issue. It is
only sleeping for the time being.

<P>
   Michael Tighe made history in November. While on an American
Airlines flight from Boston to Los Angeles with his wife, he
suffered a cardiac arrest. A previously healthy 62-year-old jogger
and public health officer in Boston, Tighe stopped breathing and
had no pulse or blood pressure. His heart was beating chaotically,
unable to send blood to his brain or other vital organs.
</P>
<P>
   But before his brain could die, a flight attendant, Kevin Dunn,
quickly started CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) while another
attendant got the flight's first-aid kit. In it was a portable
defibrillator, a device placed on board just three days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn used the book-size automated external defibrillator, or
AED, to administer four electric shocks through palm-size paddles
to Tighe's heart to get its rhythm back on track.
</P>
<P>
   Then the plane made an emergency landing and Tighe, the first
person to have been saved by a defibrillator on a domestic airline,
was taken to a hospital for further treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Tighe is living proof of the value of this $3,000 device. His
rescue supports his own previous efforts to get portable
defibrillators in Boston's fire trucks, high-rises and shopping
malls, which resulted in an 8 percent increase in the city's
cardiac survival rate.
</P>
<P>
   As he told People magazine earlier this year, ``Defibrillators
should be as common as fire extinguishers.''
</P>
<P>
   His view is shared by a fast-growing number of health and safety
personnel around the country.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few months, for example, the five front-line patrol
cars in Denville, N.J., were equipped with AED's through donations
from the local American Legion post. Although they have not yet
saved any lives, Lieut. Rick McConnell, the patrol division
commander, said his officers were ``really gung-ho'' about their
new role as trained and equipped first-responders in a medical
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Had such a device been readily available when the Cincinnati
Reds played their first home game of the 1996 season, John
McSherry, an umpire who suffered a fatal heart attack during the
game, might be alive today.
</P>
<P>
   So might two basketball stars who died of cardiac arrest: Hank
Gathers of Loyola Marymount University, who died during a game in
1990, and Reggie Lewis of the Boston Celtics, who died in 1993
while shooting baskets in a gym.
</P>
<P>
   Most people are at least aware of the value of CPR and millions
of people have been trained to use it when someone collapses with
no pulse or respiration.
</P>
<P>
   But few people, including those trained in CPR, realize that
this first-aid technique of manually pushing oxygenated blood
through the body buys only a few minutes when a person's heart is
beating erratically.
</P>
<P>
   For every minute that elapses after normal blood flow ceases,
the person's chances of survival diminish by 7 percent to 10
percent. After 10 minutes, there is little hope of survival,
especially of survival with an intact brain.
</P>
<P>
   For some 250,000 people a year in this country, death is the
outcome of a cardiac arrest, according to the American Heart
Association. Survival rates for people who suffer a cardiac arrest
outside of a hospital are now as low as 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Cantwell, a cardiologist in Atlanta and one of the team
doctors for the Atlanta Braves, said that many cardiac arrests
occurred in people with hearts too good to die.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, perhaps precipitated by intense emotional or
physical stress or, in the case of some athletes, by a sharp blow
to the chest or a hidden heart muscle disorder, the heart will
lapse into an erratic and useless rhythm called ventricular
fibrillation in the heart's main pumping chamber.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, underlying coronary artery disease is the cause,
Cantwell said. Or a heart may suddenly start beating much too fast,
a condition called ventricular tachycardia, and then lapse into
ventricular fibrillation. In other cases, a heart attack that is
caused by a complete blockage of a coronary artery will touch off
ventricular fibrillation.
</P>
<P>
   A heart in fibrillation will not revert to a normal rhythm on
its own, and the faster it can be shocked back into beating
normally, the better. Until about a decade ago, only hospitals and
highly sophisticated rescue vehicles had defibrillators, and in the
past they were not portable and only doctors were allowed to use
them.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the AED, weighing about four to seven pounds and
computerized to be idiot-proof. Anyone, even a child, can quickly
learn to operate one, since the device takes a reading of the
patient's cardiac status, tells the operator what to do each step
of the way (press a button or not) and is designed not to
administer a shock if one is not warranted; for example, if the
heart is not beating erratically.
</P>
<P>
   The goal now is to get defibrillators and people trained to use
them where they are most likely to be effective, especially in the
public places where people are at increased risk of cardiac arrest
or are distant from rapid emergency medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Cantwell would like to see the devices in health clubs and
fitness centers, high-rise residences, retirement communities,
centers for the elderly, large office buildings, airports and
airlines, cruise ships, golf courses, sports arenas and
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that by adding just a few pennies to the cost of a
ticket at an athletic event, every tier of a stadium could be
equipped with a defibrillator.
</P>
<P>
   In Rochester, Minn., after all the squad cars were given the
devices, survival after cardiac arrest jumped to 50 percent from 20
percent, according to a study by Dr. Roger White of the Mayo
Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Rodman Starke, executive vice president for science and
medicine at the heart association, said that in big cities like New
York or in tall buildings, it took too long to get emergency
personnel to the scene of a cardiac arrest. In many situations, the
defibrillators have to be on the premises to be truly useful.
</P>
<P>
   The heart association is hoping to begin an $18 million
federally financed study to determine the survival value of having
the device and people trained to use them in various locations. In
casinos in Las Vegan, Nev., where several cardiac arrests occur
nearly every day, survival rates sharply improved after the casinos
were equipped with portable defibrillators and the security guards
were trained to use them.
</P>
<P>
   There the response time is often less than a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Leonard A. Cobb, cardiologist at Harborview Medical Center
in Seattle, a leader in cardiac resuscitation, noted that since
``nearly three-quarters of cardiac arrests occur at home, it would
make sense to have a defibrillator in the home of someone with
known heart disease,'' like those who have had heart attacks,
angina attacks or coronary bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost of a portable defibrillator has dropped from $6,000
to $3,000, and I think it will drop further, which would make it
affordable for more people,'' Cobb said.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb published a report in The Journal of the American Medical
Association last week demonstrating a survival benefit when CPR was
administered for just 90 seconds before the defibrillator was
activated, especially if it took four or more minutes to get the
AED to the patient.
</P>
<P>
   But even in a city like Seattle, which has long been a leader in
emergency cardiac care, it often takes eight minutes for rescuers
with a defibrillator to reach a victim of cardiac arrest. Thus, the
best the study could demonstrate was a survival rate of 30 percent
when CPR preceded defibrillation.
</P>
<P>
   One obstacle to the installation of defibrillators for use by
nonmedical personnel has been the fear of liability if the device
is believed to have been misused.
</P>
<P>
   The heart association has been fighting for legislation that
would absolve ``good samaritans'' from such liability. So far, 31
states have granted limited immunity for lay responders, and
legislation to provide immunity nationwide will be introduced in
Congress soon.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the heart association, through its Heartsaver AED
program, is offering a new lifesaving course that includes
defibrillation training at community training centers through the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The four-hour course is available to emergency and rescue
personnel, security guards, airline personnel, family members of
heart patients and other lay rescuers. To locate one, contact the
American Heart Association at (800) AHA-USA1.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Until he bit into a piece of raw cabbage on that February
evening in 1997, Dr. Raymond Fowler had not thought much about the
sense of taste.
</P>
<P>
   The cabbage, part of a pasta dish he was preparing for his
family's dinner, had an odd, burning taste, but he did not pay it
much attention. Then a few minutes later, his daughter handed him a
glass of cola, and he took a swallow. ``It was like sulphuric
acid,'' he said. ``It was like the hottest thing you could imagine
boring into your mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few weeks, Fowler, who is the chief executive
officer of the American Psychological Association in Washington,
realized that something was badly askew in his gustatory world.
Everything he ate tasted like ``unsalted dough.'' Ice water was
painfully sweet, ``as if someone had added three packages of
Equal.'' An unpleasant salty sensation gathered at the back of his
mouth and would not go away.
</P>
<P>
   When eating finally became so unpleasant that he was reduced to
swigging down high-nutrition supplements, Fowler sought help from a
colleague, Dr. Linda Bartoshuk, a Yale University psychologist
specializing in the study of taste.
</P>
<P>
   In Dr. Bartoshuk's lab, Fowler's cranial nerves were tested for
taste and for pain, his tongue was painted with blue food coloring
and videotaped in action, his ability to smell turpentine, coffee
and other odors was tested, and a thorough examination was
conducted of his mouth, including the fungiform pappilae, or the
structures that house taste buds, on his tongue.
</P>
<P>
   Then Dr. Bartoshuk delivered her diagnosis: the burning
sensations and mysterious tastes, she told him, were sensory
phantoms, his brain's response to damage to the chorda tympani, a
branch of the VII cranial nerve that serves taste buds in the front
of the tongue, runs through the middle ear, and carries taste
messages to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   The damage, Dr. Bartoshuk said, was probably temporary, and
might be the result of a medicine Fowler was taking, or by a viral
infection. And a few months later his sense of taste did return to
normal.
</P>
<P>
   The most familiar example of phantom sensation is phantom limb
syndrome, in which a patient continues to feel pain in an arm or
leg long after the limb has been amputated. But phantoms can occur
in any of the senses. Tinnitus, or constant ringing in the ears is
a type of auditory phantom. People who have lost much of their
vision often experience visual phantoms.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors historically have viewed phantoms of taste and smell as
insignificant _ if annoying _ side effects of injury or illness, or
dismissed them as neurotic symptoms. When the composer George
Gershwin reported experiencing, among other complaints, a
persistent smell of burning rubber, for example, he was told by
doctors that he had a nervous affliction. Gershwin died a few years
later of a brain tumor.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, however, a surge of scientific interest in the
mechanisms of human taste and olfaction has focused new attention
on the ways in which these senses can become disordered, and as a
result, phantoms of taste and smell are receiving greater scrutiny.
Though there are no precise numbers, scientists estimate that such
phantom sensations afflict one percent or more of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bartoshuk, who has evaluated more than 100 cases of taste
phantoms, and her colleagues will present some of their work at the
annual meeting of the Association for Chemoreception Sciences in
Sarasota, Fla., this week.
</P>
<P>
   Because taste and smell are so closely linked, it is sometimes
difficult to tell which system is in trouble. Patients who suffer
from anosmia, or a loss of smell, for example, often report to
clinics complaining instead that they have lost their sense of
taste.
</P>
<P>
   But taste and smell phantoms, Dr. Bartoshuk said, usually can be
distinguished by their quality. Bitter, salty, sweet, or sour
phantoms _ corresponding to four basic categories the tongue can
distinguish _ are always related to disorders of taste. Smell
phantoms, in contrast, are usually more complex in nature: Patients
may complain of tasting or smelling rotting food, for example,
fecal matter, gasoline, or smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Like Fowler, some patients who have taste phantoms also suffer
from ``burning mouth syndrome,'' an intense burning sensation on
the tongue, often at its tip. When Dr. Bartoshuk examined Fowler,
she discovered that he was a ``supertaster,'' someone who has an
unusually large density of taste buds, each surrounded by pain
fibers. Supertasters, Dr. Bartoshuk has found, are more likely to
develop burning mouth syndrome, as are post-menopausal women, who
often have lost their ability to sense bitter tastes.
</P>
<P>
   The link between burning mouth syndrome and taste phantoms led
Dr. Bartoshuk to theorize that both were the result of damage to
the chorda tympani, one of three cranial nerves involved in taste.
Scientists have found that the taste system involves a complicated
feedback loop, with each nerve acting to inhibit the signals of
other nerves. The chorda tympani, in particular, appears to exert
an inhibitory influence on other taste nerves, as well as on pain
fibers in the tongue.
</P>
<P>
   When the chorda tympani is damaged, its inhibitory function is
disrupted, prompting increased activity in other nerves. In an
elegant series of experiments, Dr. Bartoshuk and Dr. John Kveton,
an otological surgeon at Yale, have found that when the chorda
tympani is anesthetized, research subjects experience intensified
sensation in areas served by other taste nerves. In about 40
percent of the subjects, anesthetizing the chorda tympani produced
taste phantoms, the result, Dr. Bartoshuk argues, of the
disinhibition.
</P>
<P>
   In other work, to be presented at the chemoreception sciences
meeting, the psychologist and her colleagues showed that when the
chorda tympani is anesthetized, pain sensitivity increases in
regions served by the trigeminal nerve on the opposite side of the
tongue. Supertasters, who have a denser field of pain fibers, had
the greatest increase in pain sensation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   In another study, the researchers found that patients with
burning mouth syndrome showed severe damage to the chorda tympani,
suggesting pain phantoms may appear when the chorda tympani's
inhibiting influence is interrupted. ``All of a sudden, the genie
is out of the bottle,'' Dr. Bartoshuk said.
</P>
<P>
   The taste system's feedback loop, she said, may make
evolutionary sense, insuring, for example, that if one nerve is
damaged the others increase their activity to compensate. This is
seen most clearly in patients whose chorda tympani nerve has been
damaged by ear surgery. Such patients, doctors find, rarely
complain of taste loss.
</P>
<P>
   Clonazepam, an anti-seizure drug, seems effective in treating
burning mouth syndrome in more than 70 percent of patients, Dr.
Bartoshuk said, perhaps because it has an inhibitory action on the
brain.
</P>
<P>
   While virtually every taste phantom, she said, can be traced to
nerve damage somewhere in the taste system, smell phantoms are much
more difficult to account for. Many are clearly related to a head
injury or a viral illness. But occasionally, olfactory phantoms
appear spontaneously, with no identifiable cause.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Donald Leopold, an associate professor in the department of
otolaryngology-head and neck surgery at Johns Hopkins University,
said he has performed surgeries on nine patients who sought his
help after being plagued by spontaneous smell phantoms that
persisted for years.
</P>
<P>
   His patients, said Leopold, who will present the cases at the
chemoreception sciences meeting this week, are usually women
between the ages of 20 and 40. They come from all walks of life and
do not appear to have other significant health problems. Typically,
he said, a patient ``is going along with her usual life and at 10
o'clock in the morning on a Thursday, all of a sudden she
experiences a bad smell.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, he said, the odor departs after a short time and returns
intermittently over a period of months, but eventually becomes a
constant presence. ``They're miserable,'' Leopold said. ``At some
point most have told me that it's really not worth living with
this.'' One woman, he said, claimed the smell went away when her
nose was irritated. ``She bent a paper clip and stuck it up her
nose,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kain Blandford, one of Leopold's patients, was 18 years old and
working as a waitress when she was struck by what she calls ``The
Taste.'' She ordered a hamburger and fries at McDonald's, took a
bite of her lunch, and found that it tasted ``really bad,'' as if
something was rotten. A month later, the rotten taste returned.
When it started happening every few weeks, she said, ``I realized
that this is me, that this is not the food.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Blandford began to keep track of the things that brought the
rotten sensation on: steam, grease, humidity, heavy perfume.
</P>
<P>
   For a while she thought crying caused it to go away, and she
would think about the saddest things she could imagine in order to
make herself cry. Then she though it got better when she pinched
her nostrils. ``I started holding my nose all the time,'' she said.
``I didn't want to tell people about it because it's so
embarrassing and so strange.''
</P>
<P>
   When, three years ago, Ms. Blandford, who is now 29 and a radio
announcer in Charleston, S.C., reached the point that she had
stopped eating altogether, she called Leopold, and underwent
surgery shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   By anesthetizing each side of her nose in turn and testing her
sense of smell, Leopold determined that the problem was one-sided.
In the surgery, he excised the olfactory epithelium high in the
nose on the affected side, cutting the small nerves that pass up
through the bony plate. In every case, he said, his patients say
that the smell phantom either disappeared or subsided to a
tolerable level, although some patients underwent more than one
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Blandford said her smell phantom returned in much milder
form two years after the surgery. Given a choice of another
operation or living with the phantom's remnants, however, she opted
for the latter. ``It's a little like having a low-grade headache
all the time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Blandford said, she often wonders why she had the
phantom at all: ``When I die and I'm going up that big tunnel, the
first thing I'm going to ask is `Do you mind explaining what that
was all about?'''

DON'T PLAY WITH MY FOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Just years ago, I was a champion at the San
Francisco national sport of dining out. The goal is to find a great
restaurant before it's reviewed and the food ghouls arrive, all
ordering exactly the same things mentioned in the review.
</P>
<P>
   You have only two or three weeks to beat the critic to a
restaurant, but afterwards you can say you went there before it was
discovered, and quote culinary authority Yogi Berra.
</P>
<P>
   Now I've moved on to a higher level of foodiedom. I subscribe to
Saveur magazine (for the articles, not just the pictures) and cook
at home. One thing you can say for home: It isn't suddenly overrun
with strangers taking every table, making you eat at either 5:30
p.m or 10 p.m. in about three months.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to call a snotty ``reservationist'' either. We at
least got a snotty maitre d' in days gone by.
</P>
<P>
   I kicked the restaurant addiction when food writers began using
the word ``architectural,'' waiters began talking about serving
meat and fish on ``beds'' of whatever, and ``fusion'' became a
cuisine instead of a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to put anything architectural in my mouth, nor live
in an edible building. The only food I like served on beds is
breakfast. With a few notable exceptions, fusion is a bomb.
</P>
<P>
   For twenty years, California chefs have been so creative and
innovative _ the big words _ that they've created innovative new
culinary cliches.
</P>
<P>
   The not-so-specials of every day include miso-glazed Chilean sea
bass and seared ahi with ginger-mango aioli and Thai salsa on beds
of fennel or lentils. The eyes miso-glaze over.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``ahi'' means ``required on any expensive menu,'' just
as ``salmon en croute'' did 25 years ago. The difference is that
the ahi is undercooked and the salmon was overcooked.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter of a century ago Calvin Trillin described the American
palace of high dining as ``La Maison de la Casa House, Continental
Cuisine,'' serving the cliches of those days he called
``Stuff-Stuff with Heavy.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to meat or fish stuffed with other stuff, then
buried in a heavy sauce to ensure indisguishability of ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Now we dine at ``Le Bistro Asia d'Italia, Contemporary Fusion
Cuisine,'' and it specializes in ``With-With on a Bed of.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The following are a few dishes created by Bay Area chefs, as
described in menus and food pages: ``Pacific Rim jumbo prawn
resting on a strip of nori seaweed atop a tower of sushi rice with
black bean wasabi sauce.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind how the prawn rests. Where on the Pacific Rim was it
caught and how long ago?
</P>
<P>
   ``Napoleon of filet mignon layered with grilled red onions, a
portobello mushroom and baby carrots atop potatoes Anna with a
Cabernet demiglace.''
</P>
<P>
   Beef Wellington, defeated by beef Napoleon. But who's Anna?
``Garlic prawn and crispy tofu on a nest of carrots with basil-
chili glaze.''
</P>
<P>
   A nest? Is that a bed for those who eat like birds? ``Day-boat
scallops on a bed of sweet-corn flan.''
</P>
<P>
   What are these day-boat scallops on menus everywhere? Where I
come from, all scallop boats came back daily.
</P>
<P>
   &QC;  &QC;  How did we manage to live back in our iceberg salad days? We
actually ate mashed potatoes without roasted garlic in them, and
the potatoes were served next to the meat, not under it.
</P>
<P>
   We survived because kids will eat anything, just as our parents
would eat any Stuff-Stuff with Heavy. Cooking skipped a generation
in America, but some of us were lucky enough to have our
grandmothers in the house.
</P>
<P>
   My grandmothers were from Maine and I inherited a couple of
great ways to make beans (with onion or without) and the only way
to make lobster (steamed with drawn butter, and pay no attention to
French chefs).
</P>
<P>
   You can't live on beans and lobster alone, so my wife and I have
taken to pillaging other cultures' cooking. From one of our friends
we've picked up a family recipe for making greens with turnip,
onion and a bit of honey, and made it about 20 times this winter
just for the pot likker.
</P>
<P>
   We've struggled with the specific gravity of matzoh balls.
</P>
<P>
   We've experimented with every olive oil between extra-virgin,
cold-pressed picholine to 10W40. We even made Iowa food.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Saveur comes in. This is no cutesy Gourmet
magazine. Saveur is about real food from real places like Albia,
Iowa, Breaux Bridge, La., and North Beach, San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   If you missed having a cuisine as a kid, you can find all you
want in Saveur, with non-precious photographs. Photographers and
cooks are listed in the credits, and no ``food stylists.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the homemade egg noodles cooked in real beef broth and
served on mashed potatoes looked good. They were from a recipe by
an Iowa grandmother, so the potatoes weren't mashed with roasted
garlic.
</P>
<P>
   The noodles weren't served on a bed, but a La-Z-Boy of potatoes.
You wouldn't use the word ``architectural.'' You'd use the words
``splooshy'' and ``carby.''
</P>
<P>
   Like lobster, baked beans, greens or matzoh ball soup, it tasted
a lot better than it looked. That's the way food should be.
</P>
<P>
   When I'm cooking, that's the way you'll get it.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Annette Bauman of Great Neck, N.Y., turned 50 and seemed in
perfect health _ no known ailments, no known emotional problems _
when she awoke in the night feeling extremely dizzy and deathly
ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's happening,'' she told her husband. Then,
within two hours, the sensation passed and she was fine. For a
while.
</P>
<P>
   In the next weeks, the illness struck again three times. Her
blood pressure soared during the attacks, her doctors said, though
they could not determine why. This episode of elevated blood
pressure put her in grave danger of suffering a heart attack or
stroke. But each episode passed, and her blood pressure and health
appeared to return to normal.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks, however, persisted. By 1993, seven years later, she
had seen a virtual army of doctors. Some suspected immediately that
she had a tumor called a pheochromacytoma, which develops in the
adrenal glands and also causes sudden, severe but short-term
hypertension and other similar symptoms. But she did not. She was
treated with a variety of standard hypertension medications but
nothing worked. Eventually the persistent, unpredictable attacks
forced her to give up her job as a piano teacher.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time as Mrs. Bauman's attacks were occurring, Dr.
Samuel Mann, an associate professor of clinical medicine at the
Hypertension Center of New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center,
was seeing a string of similar cases: strange episodes of
unexplained and severe hypertension occurring sporadically during
periods of what appeared to be perfectly normal health.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Mann said, the cases were baffling, apparently
undiagnosable and untreatable. But then he began to see a pattern
emerge. He describes the finding, along with his view of its
significance, in the current issue of Archives of Internal
Medicine, in which he tells of 21 cases he has treated over the
last seven years.
</P>
<P>
   The arresting moment in his analysis of these episodes came for
him, he said, when two patients in a row arrived at his office with
almost identical medical histories. One he described as a
33-year-old man who had been hospitalized many times with
intermittent and inexplicable attacks similar to Mrs. Bauman's. As
with many others in the article, the man would also be hit with
pounding headaches, severe chest pains, neck pain, nausea and other
signs of serious illness.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Mann, the patient reported being in perfect
health between the attacks and insisted that he had had no
particular emotional stress in his life. But Mann said he
questioned further and the patient began to reveal that his father
had beaten him badly as a child. However, the patient had driven
the trauma out of his consciousness, and expressed a feeling of
strong love for his father, and no anger. The patient was referred
to a psychiatric counselor who diagnosed an anxiety disorder. He
was treated with an antidepressant, and the episodes ceased.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bauman finally crossed Mann's path when she was referred to
New York Hospital's Hypertension Center. After taking her medical
history, he suggested that she consider a psychological evaluation,
and she reacted angrily. ``I thought he was nuts!'' Mrs. Bauman
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Bauman eventually listened to Mann because nothing else
had worked. She saw a therapist, who she said helped her uncover a
troubling but suppressed side of her childhood. Mrs. Bauman said
she had received almost no emotional support from her parents and
had been allowed no emotional closeness. Concluding that this had
caused her deep if hidden stress, the therapist put her on an
anti-anxiety drug while continuing the hypertension medication.
Within months she was free of the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion Mann draws in the medical journal is that a link
exists between patients with episodic hypertension, also called
paroxysmal hypertension, and powerful emotions or traumatic
experiences that they are either unaware they had or that they have
driven out of their awareness. The signs of this condition, he
said, are the sudden episodes of severe blood-pressure elevation,
often accompanied by physical symptoms like dizziness, headaches,
chest pain and weakness, and finally the return of what appears to
be normal health. The common underlying element, he said, is a
hidden emotional problem and a denial of its existence.
</P>
<P>
   In 13 of the cases reported, the attacks ceased with a treatment
based on the finding that these hidden emotions were factors in the
disorder. In seven of the 13, the treatment combined traditional
hypertension therapy, like the use of alpha or beta blockers, with
an antidepressant. In three, the disorder was cured with talk
therapy alone, without antidepressants or anti-anxiety drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In two patients, treatment failed. For one of the remaining six,
attacks ceased before treatment was begun; another was intolerant
of medication; two died of unrelated causes before treatment could
be assessed and two refused treatment. Dr. William White, chief of
the section of hypertension and clinical pharmacology and a
professor of medicine at the University of Connecticut Medical
School at Farmington, who did earlier studies of hypertension, said
Mann's work was an important advance.
</P>
<P>
   White found correlations between open and obvious panic attacks
and episodic hypertension: In patients afflicted with panic attacks
or acute anxiety, he found episodes of severe blood-pressure
elevation, and, conversely, in studying episodic hypertension, he
found an increased incidence of panic attacks.
</P>
<P>
   White said the finding that hidden anxiety or depression could
be related to these episodes would be of great value to patients
whose doctors were unable to explain the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics on the number and nature of episodic hypertension
cases are not compiled, Mann said, and many doctors regard the
condition as rare. But Dr. Lawrence Krakoff, a professor of
medicine at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, said that,
because it is so often unrecognized, it must be much more common
than thought. Krakoff says he sees three or four cases a year at
Englewood Hospital in New Jersey, where he is chief of medicine. He
estimates that 1 percent or 2 percent of the nation's 40 million
hypertensive patients, or 600,000, suffer episodes from hidden
emotional causes.
</P>
<P>
   Mann, author of ``Healing Hypertension: Uncovering the Secret
Power of Your Hidden Emotions'' (John Wiley &AMP; Sons), said
researchers tried for more than 40 years to prove a link between
ordinary, long-term hypertension and the distressful emotions that
patients were consciously aware of. But the evidence of such a
connection, he said, has been weak.
</P>
<P>
   He said that hidden emotions had a different effect, and that
they might play a role in as many as a quarter of patients with
ordinary hypertension, and those with the episodic form. Consider
the case of a 49-year-old woman whose uncontrollable hypertension
ceased overnight after she revealed that she had been raped at the
age of 14. This, she said, she had never told anyone.

<P>
   For 28 years Bill Gaston, 41, has been running, and for 28 years
he has veered in and out of the ``zone,'' a state of heightened
attention in which exercise seems effortless and time passes
easily. During one recent 3,000-meter race, the long and lean
magazine editor re-entered that familiar territory: ``I grew
strong. I got a beautiful feeling of being in gear. I was
concentrating so much I felt like I was floating.'' Sighing, he
added, ``You live for these kinds of experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   What athletes call the zone, psychologists know as the less
flashy ``flow.'' Either way, this intensely pleasurable, almost
mystical, experience may be the key to helping those who loathe
physical activity learn to enjoy it, according to a group of
researchers in North America and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The experience of flow was first identified in the early 1970s
by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (pronounced chik-SENT-me-hi), a
psychologist at the University of Chicago. People can get absorbed
playing games, socializing at parties and working at creative jobs,
but they are especially prone to flow during physical activity,
according to Csikszentmihalyi's research.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get hooked on the sensation,'' said Dr. Jay C. Kimiecik,
an exercise psychology researcher at Miami University in Ohio.
Kimiecik contends that the possibility of flow helps motivate the
15 percent of Americans who exercise regularly to continue their
regimens. ``If more people could develop these positive feelings,
more people would work out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Flow is commonly reported by professional and Olympic-calibre
athletes, but information on ordinary workouts in gyms is scarce.
Dr. Bob Grove of the University of Western Australia, one of the
few researchers to study gym members, learned that some conditions
favor the experience. ``We found that more experienced circuit
trainers (with more than six months' involvement) reported more
flowlike experiences than less-experienced circuit trainers,'' said
Grove, of the department of human movement and exercise science.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that exercisers prone to flow were also
highly susceptible to being hypnotized. Overlapping features of the
flow and hypnotic states ``include dissociation/detachment from
one's surroundings, absorption, feelings of control, and perceptual
distortions such as altered perceptions of time,'' Grove said.
</P>
<P>
   For any exerciser, the stage for flow is set when the skill
level of the exerciser matches the challenge of the activity,
according to research by Dr. Sue A. Jackson, a sport psychology
lecturer at Queensland University of Technology in Australia and
co-author, with Csikszentmihalyi, of the book ``The Sports High''
(Human Kinetics).
</P>
<P>
   ``If a situation is too challenging, you become anxious,''
Kimiecik said. The tennis match against a much-better opponent, the
step routines that cannot be mastered, the too-long run _ all
create distress. Such uneasiness interferes with an exerciser's
ability to attain flow by breaking his or her concentration,
according to a recent study of adult competitive exercisers in the
Journal of Sport and Exercise Psychology.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, too little challenge creates boredom. And
even those who start out engaged may end up understimulated.
``People get better as they exercise, and then they lose the
feeling of challenge,'' Kimiecik said.
</P>
<P>
   For some people, entering competitions supplies the needed zest.
So can working out with a group, as Gaston does as president of the
Van Cortlandt Track Club in the Bronx. ``You can latch on to
someone and a certain group glide happens.''
</P>
<P>
   While not questioning the existence of flow, some sport
psychologists believe that pursuing the mental state is
unnecessary. They doubt that experiencing it motivates people to
exercise more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am completely unconvinced that attaining flow or some other
euphoric state during exercise will systematically enhance exercise
adherence or reduce the risk of drop-out,'' said Dr. Jack Raglin, a
sport psychologist at Indiana University. People quit because of a
change in schedule, time constraints, a nagging injury, the lack of
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Flow researchers would respond that people who enjoyed exercise
would surmount the barriers. They argue that it is more important
to focus on the process rather than the results of working out.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are told to exercise because they'll lose weight, lower
their risk of disease, and live longer,'' said Kimiecik. ``But
people aren't motivated by distant outcomes. More important is what
they're feeling at the moment.''

<P>
   Many Americans, upon seeing the number of servings of foods that
the Food Guide Pyramid suggests should be consumed each day, say,
``Impossible!'' Among typical responses to these recommendations
from the U.S. Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human
Services: ``If I ate that much, I'd turn into a blimp'' and ``I
can't possibly fit in all those grains and vegetables in the course
of a normal day.''
</P>
<P>
   But these and other objections mainly arise from a
misunderstanding of just how much _ or, rather, how little _ makes
up one serving of different foods and how easy it is to consume
half or more of the day's recommended allowances in just one meal.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are accustomed to big portions _ two to three times
the portion sizes eaten by the typical French citizen.
</P>
<P>
   The standardized serving sizes on packaged-food labels are not
necessarily the same as those in the food pyramid. For dry foods,
the serving sizes on the labels are determined by a certain number
of grams of the food. For liquid foods, the labels' serving sizes
are based on cups.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, two ounces of uncooked pasta (about 56 grams) is a serving
that when cooked is about one cup of spaghetti but up to two cups
of a large shaped pasta like rigatoni. Yet, according to the food
pyramid, a half-cup of cooked pasta is one serving and one cup
would be two servings of a grain-based food. Furthermore, a more
typical serving of pasta would be two cups, amounting to four
servings on the pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   For ready-to-eat cereals, serving sizes on labels are also based
on grams and range from a half-cup for granolas to two cups for
puffed cereals. But the pyramid considers one cup of a ready-to-eat
cereal a serving, which would match the serving size of a cereal
like Wheaties or Cheerios. For breads, a serving is about one
ounce, or one slice of standard packaged loaf. But a New York bagel
typically weighs about four ounces, or four servings of a grain
food. And a two-ounce hamburger bun is two servings. So it is all
too easy to consume six to 11 servings a day from the grain group.
</P>
<P>
   Nor should it be difficult to get in two to four servings of
fruit and three to five of vegetables, since a serving is only six
ounces of fruit or vegetable juice, one medium apple, a half-cup of
a cooked vegetable or one cup of a raw leafy vegetable.
</P>
<P>
   Note too that in the meat group, portion sizes of meat, poultry
and fish refer to cooked food. Since these foods lose moisture and
fat when cooked, they lose weight. A quarter-pound burger may be
only three ounces cooked, or one serving of meat. And a half pound
of fish may be only six ounces cooked, or two meat servings.
</P>
<P>
   Since the pyramid suggests a range of servings for each food
group, the number of servings you eat each day should be determined
by your ideal weight and activity level. The food pyramid is a
guide for an average-size moderately active adult, with the lower
number of servings in each group considered the minimum intake for
good health. While someone who is 5 feet tall and sedentary may be
able to consume only the minimum to maintain a normal body weight,
a marathoner 6 feet tall who runs 35 miles a week may need far more
than the maximum number of suggested servings.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the number of servings consumed, it is important
to eat foods from each group each day and to choose a variety of
foods from within each group to assure a reasonable balance of
essential nutrients.

AN ENZYME TO CHALLENGE ROGUE COLORS IN THE WASHER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joel Cherry is a scientist, but he is a bit of a drill sergeant
as well. In the boot camp that is his laboratory, he has been
whipping an enzyme into shape, preparing it for the rigors of that
domestic battlefield known as the washing machine.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to eliminate a common laundry-day disaster, when a
washerful of white clothes is forever tinted by one colored item
that, like a rogue agent, has infiltrated the load.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a scourge to all humanity,'' said Cherry, a researcher
for the Danish drug and enzyme producer Novo Nordisk. ``Everybody's
done it at least once.''
</P>
<P>
   The enzyme, an iron-containing peroxidase found in an ink cap
mushroom, Coprinus cinereus, appears to be a handy solution for
neutralizing such mistakes. It catalyzes a peroxide reaction that
removes the color from dyes. But it only works on dyes that have
leached into the wash water; fabrics themselves are left alone. So
the color from an errant sock, say, would not harm the rest of the
load.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the enzyme in its natural state is hardly
tough enough for the job.
</P>
<P>
   It is content to help the mushroom decompose a stump or log in
the relatively benign environment of a forest. A washing machine,
with its hot soapy water, presents far harsher conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Working at a Novo lab in Davis, Calif., Cherry and his
colleagues used a technique known as directed evolution to modify
the enzyme so that it could tolerate higher temperatures and the
alkaline and oxidative conditions created by detergents. He and the
others described their work in the current issue of the journal
Nature Biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   With the technique, mutations are created in the gene that is
responsible for the production of the enzyme. Mutations that alter
the enzyme's amino acid chain and result in improved performance
are saved; those that are harmful are discarded. The good mutations
are then ``shuffled'' _ recombined genetically, in this case in
yeast cells _ to find combinations that perform even better.
</P>
<P>
   The technique, Cherry said, ``allows you to separate the good
from the bad in a very empirical way; by taking a whole pool of
good mutants, you can enrich for the good mutations.''
</P>
<P>
   Without directed evolution, he said, a basic principle of
genetics, known as Muller's ratchet, takes over.
</P>
<P>
   It holds that in nature, mutations go from bad to worse: harmful
ones are accumulated at a greater rate than beneficial ones.
</P>
<P>
   Cherry and his colleagues created the mutations both randomly
and in a more rational way, by examining the structure of the
enzyme for vulnerable areas. In particular, they looked at the heme
group, which contains the iron atom that is essential for the
decolorizing reaction.
</P>
<P>
   They designed three mutations to remove oxidizable residues
around the group, improving the enzyme's ability to stand up to the
peroxides in the wash water. A fourth mutation was designed to help
the enzyme tolerate higher temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   When this mutated gene is shuffled with the beneficial mutations
produced randomly, the result is an enzyme that can withstand water
temperatures over 120 degrees Fahrenheit, as well as high pH and
peroxide levels. It is ready for the washing machine.
</P>
<P>
   Novo hopes to see it in detergents soon. In the meantime,
though, the directed evolution technique holds promise for custom
tailoring other enzymes, said Willem Dr. P.C. Stemmer, co-author of
an analysis of the Novo work in the same issue of Nature
Biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   Directed evolution, Stemmer said, ``is a way to improve very
complex systems without knowing much detail.'' And the improvements
that are possible could result in the greater use of tailored
enzymes, rather than chemicals, as catalysts in industry. Such
chemistry would be ``greener,'' producing fewer waste products.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways it might also be simpler. Rather than a series of
reactions occurring in steps, an industrial process could more
resemble what goes on in a living cell, where many reactions
proceed at the same time, without the formation of unwanted waste,
because there are so many enzymes with quite specific functions.
</P>
<P>
   Stemmer foresees a day when the full set of reactions in an
industrial process could take place in one vessel. A more elaborate
version, perhaps, of a washing machine with Cherry's enzyme
swirling around inside.

SAN FRANCISCO TEST SCORES ARE UP, BUT WHY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIAN GUTHRIE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ San Francisco public schools have astounded
educators nationwide by posting six years of consecutive test score
gains.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers from here to New York have gushed over the urban
district's rare winning streak. Schools chief Bill Rojas, credited
for the gains, was named by colleagues administrator of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But an Examiner analysis of tests shows that behind the vaunted
success is an eye-opening district practice: While student
enrollment remains flat, test results from fewer students are being
reported each year, raising questions about whether the gains are
real or manipulated.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the past decade, the number of student math scores
reported declined by 12 percent, and the number of reading scores
reported plunged 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``In San Francisco, I don't know if big increases in test scores
are from class size reduction or certain pupils being removed from
the testing base,'' said Stanford education Professor Michael
Kirst, who is conducting a statewide study on the impact of class
size cuts.
</P>
<P>
   When Rojas was hired as superintendent in 1992, test scores were
low and languishing.
</P>
<P>
   By 1993, however, scores began a turnaround, and have since
surpassed the national averages in reading and math. The district,
the fifth largest in California, is the only major urban school
system in America to post such steady improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas, who exudes a mix of compassion and egoism, credits the
gains to reforms made between 1993 and 1998, including smaller
classes, better teacher training and increased instructional time
in middle school.
</P>
<P>
   But as scores were rising, two less-publicized changes were
happening in the district.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 1994, more than 5,000 kids who speak little if any
English _ and typically underperform their English-fluent peers _
were excluded by Rojas from testing. At the same time, Chinese
American students, who typically do well on exams, became the
dominant ethnic group in the district.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you take away a group of kids who are limited in their
ability to speak English, do you have any doubt what the effect
will be on mean scores?'' asked University of California at
Berkeley education professor and statistician Paul Holland. ``In
San Francisco, where kids are being removed from the testing base,
you don't know whether gains are from ethnic changes, a forceful
superintendent or school reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Holland, who worked at the private Princeton, N.J.-based testing
company, Educational Testing Service, for 18 years, said, ``When
you include and exclude students, data are unreliable.''
</P>
<P>
   Until 1994, San Francisco public schools tested children who
spoke limited English after they had been in school for one year.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas changed the policy to test those kids _ who make up 30
percent of the student population here _ after at least three years
of instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is nothing illegal or unethical about excusing
children who lack English skills from taking English-only exams, it
puts San Francisco at odds with other school districts nationwide
that are increasingly testing more rather than fewer students.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Smith, U.S. deputy secretary for Education, said his
agency urges schools to include as many children as possible in the
National Assessment for Educational Progress exam, given every few
years to a sampling of students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Districts should be trying to test and report scores for all
but the most severely disabled kids,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What is questionable, educators and statisticians say, is for
San Francisco to claim consecutive achievement gains without
acknowledging the gains began when a large segment of the
lowest-performing kids were taken out.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Francisco is cooking the scores by excluding all the hard
cases,'' said former San Francisco schools chief Ramon Cortines,
Rojas' predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   UC-Berkeley education Professor Bruce Fuller, co-director of
Policy Analysis for California Education, said there is another
ambiguity in determining whether San Francisco's gains are from
school reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sample of kids in San Francisco is getting increasingly
Asian American and less African American, which means the
concentration of high performers is going up,'' Fuller said.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1987 and 1998, Chinese American enrollment increased by
nearly 5 percent, while black enrollment declined by nearly 4
percent. Fifty percent of all students in the district are now
Asian American; 28 percent of the district is Chinese American.
</P>
<P>
   On the district exam, the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills,
Asian Americans score significantly higher than students of other
ethnic and racial groups. African Americans score the lowest.
</P>
<P>
   The district defends its practices.
</P>
<P>
   Rojas insists it is a waste of student time and taxpayer money
to test students in a language they don't understand, justifying
his 1994 policy that has now excluded some 6,000 kids from taking
the district exam.
</P>
<P>
   However, he does acknowledge that ``exempting limited-English
proficient students from taking the CTBS test in all likelihood
means that our test score growth is higher than if (such) students
had been included in testing.''
</P>
<P>
   But he says real gains in student achievement are evident in a
variety of other measurements besides test scores.
</P>
<P>
   Since Rojas' arrival in the district, the percentage of San
Francisco students who complete high school has risen 2.3
percentage points to 89.4 percent, well above the state's rate of
83.1 percent. The number of San Francisco students taking exams to
enter college-prep Advanced Placement classes has nearly doubled
since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   While those measures indicate that more city students are
preparing for college, another key indicator of skills is less
promising.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco students' scores on the SAT, the college entrance
exam, lag far behind the state and national average. In 1998, the
San Francisco average for math and verbal scores combined was 968,
compared with 1013 statewide and 1017 nationally. Moreover, the
average math score on the SAT for San Francisco students fell 5
points last year.

`THE TERRORIST AND THE SUPERPOWER': INSIDE THE WORLD OF OSAMA BIN
LADEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also BC-BIN-LADEN-NYT) 
(Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(lb) 
 By WARREN BERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Given that he is one of the most dangerous men in the world, the
probable source of considerable death and destruction and ``the
most wanted man on earth,'' with a $5 million bounty on his head,
surprisingly little is known about Osama bin Laden. Computer
hackers tend to get more press than he does.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Terrorist and the Superpower,'' a production of Frontline
and The New York Times, is an ambitious attempt to profile the
elusive bin Laden and to investigate the motives behind last
summer's terrorist bombings at embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, for
which he has been blamed.
</P>
<P>
   Working with a team of Times reporters who covered the story,
the Frontline producer Martin Smith and correspondent Lowell
Bergman set out to answer several vexing questions: Could the
bombings have been prevented? Do they reflect widespread anger at
the United States throughout the Islamic world? Did the United
States respond properly when it fired cruise missiles in Sudan and
Afghanistan to try to strike back at bin Laden and his supporters?
And why does someone like Osama bin Laden, a product of a wealthy
Saudi Arabian family, become a bloodthirsty terrorist in the first
place?
</P>
<P>
   That is a lot to tackle in an hour, and not all the questions
are fully answered. But the program does provide some interesting
insights on the sources of bin Laden's hostility and his movement,
which seems to have had its roots in Afghanistan's war against the
Soviet Union, in which bin Laden fought.
</P>
<P>
   In another paradox of global policy-making, it now appears, as
the program points out, that the U.S. arming of Afghan warriors
against the Russians provided great impetus to the Jihad movement
that later threatened the West. Triumphant Muslim rebels in
Afghanistan became convinced, as a radical Muslim, Ahmen Sattar,
tells Bergman, that ``if I can defeat the evil empire, I can defeat
anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden seemed to take that message to heart. He returned to
Saudi Arabia in 1989, and soon opposed the presence of U.S. troops
that arrived there during the Gulf war. The program makes a strong
case that U.S. military presence in the Muslim holy land of Saudi
Arabia, however necessary it may have been at the time of the war,
has lingered too long, helping to fan the fires of bin Laden and
other Muslim radicals.
</P>
<P>
   The program draws attention to other possible U.S. missteps on
the road to last year's tragedy. Pressure by the United States and
by the U.S.-backed Saudi regime forced bin Laden out of both his
home country and Sudan and into the Afghanistan hills, a perfect
setting in which to build a terrorist movement.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, as he was forging connections with radical forces
inside Kenya, danger signs apparent before the bombings were
perhaps not as well heeded as they might have been, the program
suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the toughest charges are leveled against the U.S.
response to the embassy bombings, in particular the missile strike
on a pharmaceutical plant in Sudan that was said to be producing
chemical weapons. In a confrontation worthy of Mike Wallace,
Bergman pins down Sandy Berger, the national security adviser, on
what appears to have been a misguided retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   There are a surprising number of interviews with those who seem
to sympathize with bin Laden (``People who work with him or live
with him like him a lot,'' says one Saudi refugee) or who at least
say the United States is to blame for inflaming him.
</P>
<P>
   The intention was perhaps to be journalistically fair to a
terrorist who typically gets cast as the heavy. But at times the
program seems to be offering a few too many rationalizations for
bin Laden's hardened attitudes. And of course it would have been
nice to hear directly from bin Laden. There is no direct interview
with the central subject, which is understandable but still a
shortcoming.
</P>
<P>
   The talking heads on display are occasionally compelling,
particularly the scary Sattar, who seethes with barely controlled
anger as he speaks of an undeclared war between the Islamic world
and the United States. But too many of the interviewees simply
offer their opinions _ not necessarily fresh ones either _ on U.S.
policy and relations between Americans and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Even though ``The Terrorist and the Superpower'' is impressively
covering a lot of territory _ from Afghanistan to the World Trade
Center in New York _ it nevertheless seems to move at a lumbering
pace. While Will Lyman narrates in a solemn monotone, the screen is
sometimes filled with nothing more lively than an extended frontal
view of a government building.
</P>
<P>
   This is a subject worthy of the most serious treatment, but that
should not preclude crisp pacing and tight editing. As bin Laden
could have told the producers, it's not enough to have something to
say. To draw attention, you must say it with a bang.

 By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ She is 77. She has raised seven children, mostly on
her own. She has published only four books of poetry in a lifetime.
But last month Marie Ponsot won one of the United States' most
prestigious literary prizes, the National Book Critics Circle
Award, for her latest collection, ``The Bird Catcher.''
</P>
<P>
   A Marie Ponsot poem is a little like a jeweled bracelet,
carefully carved, with small, firm stones embedded in it. Her
subjects are domestic life, friendship, marriage and sometimes
swimming.
</P>
<P>
   She was described in The San Francisco Chronicle as ``one of the
most elegant, intelligent poets around.'' A writer for The New
Yorker said: ``The poems reveal the moral drama enacted just
beneath the surfaces of the natural world. Ponsot attends to
elegant forms without losing sight of what they are there to
express.'' Still, Ms. Ponsot's work is little known outside the
world of poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Her poems ``are meant to be beautiful,'' Ms. Ponsot said last
week in her small apartment in Manhattan. ``That's a very
unfashionable thing to say. So unfashionable. Transgressive.''
</P>
<P>
   She is a small, tough, soft-voiced woman who swims in her
building's pool every day. Her apartment is a little dusty and
filled with piles of books, plants, photographs of her children, 14
grandchildren and step-grandchildren. ``I don't have a strong
nesting instinct,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ponsot's poems can be lyrical, as in ``The Story After the
Story,'' from ``The Bird Catcher'' (Alfred A. Knopf), about putting
her seven children to sleep at night:
</P>
<P>
   ``... bed-ready boys. I crib them, warm in their
</P>
<P>
   soft shirts, &AMP; sit to eat a bruised sweet apple
</P>
<P>
   as I nurse Chris and float on mild air ...''
</P>
<P>
   But they can also be tough, as in ``I've Been Around: It Gets Me
Nowhere'':
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the woman always too young to be
</P>
<P>
   holding the diamond the baby exulting.
</P>
<P>
   I am the worker afraid of the rules &AMP; the boss; my
</P>
<P>
   salary heats the house where I feed many children.''
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes they are very harsh. For example, in ``One Is
One'':
</P>
<P>
   ``Heart, you bully, you punk, I'm wrecked, I'm shocked
</P>
<P>
   stiff. You? you still try to rule the world _ though
</P>
<P>
   I've got you: identified, starving, locked
</P>
<P>
   in a cage you will not leave alive ...''
</P>
<P>
   What the poems have in common is verbal precision and
syntactical complexity. They are full of carefully thought-out
rhetorical strategies. She sometimes uses an ampersand to link
words, for instance, instead of ``and,'' creating a short beat
rather than a full beat between words. Ms. Ponsot is fond of
villanelles, sestinas and even tritinas. But more about that later.
</P>
<P>
   Recognition has taken so long to come, a reporter notes, that
the question is unavoidable: If Ms. Ponsot wanted to be a poet, why
did she have seven children? ``Because I loved it,'' she said
firmly, about having her children. No anger here, no sense of time
lost or wasted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had a strong desire to publish a book,'' she said. ``I
had a strong desire to write poems.'' She added: ``I see now that
was queer. I didn't realize that is a big part of what a poet has
to do. I was too busy to sit around and think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ponsot was born in Queens, to a family that relished
language. Her father was a partner in a company that imported wines
for a select list of wealthy New York families. ``He was a servant
of the rich,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother was a schoolteacher. Her grandmother kept scrapbooks
filled with poems she liked. She had a poem for everything, Ms.
Ponsot said. When sunset came, her grandmother would recite
Tennyson's ``Crossing the Bar.'' Ms. Ponsot still knows it by
heart:
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunset and evening star,
</P>
<P>
   And one clear call for me!
</P>
<P>
   And may there be no moaning of the bar
</P>
<P>
   When I put out to sea.''
</P>
<P>
   While she was still a child Ms. Ponsot began having poems
published in The Brooklyn Eagle.
</P>
<P>
   The family was Catholic, and Ms. Ponsot still considers herself
a Catholic. ``I still announce myself because I want to be in
people's face about it,'' she said. ``It's sort of like a club you
can't resign from, but anyone can get in.''
</P>
<P>
   She graduated from St. Joseph's College for Women in Brooklyn
and received a master's degree in 17th-century literature from
Columbia University. Soon after World War II she went to Paris.
</P>
<P>
   One of her fellow passengers on the boat was the poet and
publisher Lawrence Ferlinghetti, who became a friend. When he
started City Lights Books in San Francisco, he published Ms.
Ponsot's first collection, ``True Minds,'' in 1957. But the book
was overshadowed by Allen Ginsberg's ``Howl,'' which Ferlinghetti
had published just before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mine disappeared without a trace,'' Ms. Ponsot said. ``Anybody
who bought `Howl' would not be interested in what I was writing.''
</P>
<P>
   In Paris she met Claude Ponsot, a French painter. ``We picked
each other up in a bar,'' she said. They married and lived in Paris
for three years. Ms. Ponsot said she had not intended to get
pregnant, but after her oldest child, Monique, was born in 1951,
she knew she loved having babies. Monique was followed by six
brothers.
</P>
<P>
   While rearing her children, she translated some 37 books from
French to English, including the ``Fables and Tales of La
Fontaine.'' She also wrote radio and television scripts, though she
didn't own a television set. ``I worked late at night when the
children had gone to bed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband were divorced in 1970, she said, after which
she continued to write while raising her children.
</P>
<P>
   ``People would say, `Poor thing.' I would say, `Yesss!''' she
said, making two fists with her hands. ``The kindest thing he ever
did was to leave,'' she said of her husband.
</P>
<P>
   It took 24 years for her to publish her second poetry
collection. She was an English professor at Queens College by now,
and a friend, the poet Marilyn Hacker, had heard that Knopf was
publishing a new poetry series. Knopf accepted her poems and
published ``Admit Impediment'' in 1981. Her third collection, ``The
Green Dark,'' was published by Knopf in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 Ms. Ponsot retired from the college and turned full time
to writing. A poet, she said, should write with ``the press of the
whole language coming to bear to say something you didn't know.''
Still, she rewrites her poems ``hundreds of times.''

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For her, difficult forms like the villanelle, the sestina and
the tritina, enable the poet to achieve more than if he or she were
just free-associating.
</P>
<P>
   Her poem ``Roundstone Cove'' is a tritina, a poem consisting of
three stanzas, each with three lines. Each line ends in one of a
set of three words, but in each stanza the end words are in a
different order. There is an additional line at the conclusion of
the poem that contains all the end words. In ``Roundstone Cove,''
the three end words are ``fog,'' ``-hood'' and ``sun'':
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind rises. The sea snarls in the fog
</P>
<P>
   far from the attentive beaches of childhood _
</P>
<P>
   no picnic, no striped chairs, no sand, no sun.

</P>
<P>

`THE GROUND BENEATH HER FEET': TURNING ROCK 'N' ROLL INTO QUAKES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(lb) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Ground Beneath Her Feet,'' Salman Rushdie's loose, baggy
monster of a new novel, is a retelling of the Orpheus myth that
recasts both the doomed musician and his lost lady love as rock
stars.
</P>
<P>
   Picture Orpheus (one Ormus Cama, in Rushdie's telling) as a
brooding, kitschy combo of Elvis, Dylan and Lennon; and Eurydice
(that is, Vina Apsara) as a sort of fairy-tale composite of Madonna
and Diana, princess of Wales.
</P>
<P>
   Picture Eurydice not only being condemned to Hades but also
being literally swallowed by the ground during an earthquake.
Picture Orpheus trying to recapture his beloved (or at least her
memory) by going on a worldwide stadium tour titled ``Into the
Underworld.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Rushdie's myriad talents as a writer, the resulting
novel is a decidedly disappointing performance: a handful of
dazzling set pieces, bundled together with long-winded digressions,
tiresome soliloquizing about love and death and art, and cliched
descriptions of the rock 'n' roll business worthy of Jackie
Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many of Rushdie's earlier novels ``The Ground Beneath
Her Feet'' addresses the themes of exile, metamorphosis and flux,
and like those earlier books it examines such issues through the
prism of multiple dichotomies: between home and rootlessness, love
and death, East and West, reason and the irrational.
</P>
<P>
   We are once again treated to the story of several characters who
leave India to wander the world and invent new identities for
themselves abroad. And we are once again urged to read in their
story a lesson about our fragmented, chaotic world, a world that
this time is on the verge of cracking apart from tectonic cultural
shifts and political and social tremors.
</P>
<P>
   The earthquake that takes Vina's life, along with Ormus' famous
cycle of ``quake songs,'' becomes a presiding metaphor for
Rushdie's vision of our tumultuous age: a time in which both
nations and families are being flung apart by the centrifugal
forces of history, a time in which everything seems to be
``shifting, changing, getting partitioned, separated by frontiers,
splitting, re-splitting, coming apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly for the reader, Rushdie seems to have misplaced his
magician's ability to fuse the mythic and the mundane, the surreal
and the authentic, into a seamless whole.
</P>
<P>
   His earlier novels tended to be allegories about a particular
set of historical circumstances: ``Midnight's Children'' used the
story of its hero's spiritual decline as a parable of Indian
history since independence; ``Shame'' grounded its phantasmagorical
imaginings in the history of a country that was ``not quite
Pakistan,'' and ``The Moor's Last Sigh'' effortlessly turned the
fate of its hero's family into a metaphor for India's recent ups
and downs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Ground Beneath Her Feet,'' in contrast, exchanges concrete
context for a fuzzy internationalism, making a host of vague
allusions to events meant to evoke ``the uncertainty of the
modern,'' from the Vietnam War to the Chinese crackdown at
Tiananmen Square to the collapse of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time the marvelous Garcia Marquez-like flights of
fancy that enlivened Rushdie's earlier work are largely absent:
With the exception of the earthquake that devours Vina, there are
few miraculous events in this novel, no women metamorphosing into
panthers, no people falling out of airplanes, no children who can
travel through time.
</P>
<P>
   The few touches of fantasy that do surface in the novel _ Ormus'
supposed ability to anticipate the very songs that Elvis, the
Beatles and Bob Dylan would make famous 1,001 days later _ feel
like gratuitous whimsies dutifully grafted onto generic
descriptions of rock concerts and music-business shenanigans.
</P>
<P>
   Although the opening portions of the novel are animated by
scenes that conjure up the burbling, Dickensian life of Bombay with
Rushdie's patented elan, the novel rapidly winds down to become a
plodding chronicle of the intertwined lives of Ormus, Vina and
their friend and confidant, Rai, the narrator of this novel.
</P>
<P>
   Ormus, we're told, is ``the greatest popular singer of all,''
``a musical sorcerer whose melodies could make city streets begin
to dance and high buildings sway to their rhythm, a golden
troubadour the jouncy poetry of whose lyrics could unlock the very
gates of hell.'' Like Elvis, he is known for his pelvic gyrations
and curling lip; like Elvis, he is haunted by memories of a dead
twin brother, and like John Lennon, he is eventually gunned down by
a crazed fan.
</P>
<P>
   Vina, on her part, is described as ``a woman in extremis,'' an
outlaw singer who is continually reinventing herself, a troubled
woman who is mourned as a goddess by millions around the world
after her tragic death.
</P>
<P>
   As for Rai, he's a familiar Rushdie figure, a spiritual relative
of Saladin, the displaced hero of ``The Satanic Verses,'' and Moor,
the conflicted narrator of ``The Moor's Last Sigh.'' A photographer
by vocation, Rai is a professional observer who finds his
skepticism sorely tested by his encounters with Ormus and who finds
his own detachment dissolving in his love for Vina.
</P>
<P>
   At times Rai demonstrates Rushdie's magpie love of language (his
fondness for ``whatever sounded bright and shiny''). But all too
often his meditations on the story of Ormus and Vina devolve into
ponderous pontifications, the babbling of someone in love with the
sound of his own voice.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He blathers on about Ormus having double vision, suggesting that
the world he and the other characters inhabit is a kind of mirror
world of our own. He wonders ``if each of us has alternative
existences in the other continuum.'' And he speaks of ``a
transitional phase'' that ``only the imperative force of the
Immense can force towards completion.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end this portentous mumbo jumbo sucks all the air out of
this novel and deprives Ormus and Vina of their vitality as
characters. By the end of the book they have become nothing but
brightly painted puppets, mechanically re-enacting the Orpheus and
Eurydice myth while laboring under the weight of their creator's
myriad philosophical theses.
</P>
<P>
   As Rai himself suggests, they ``had ceased to be real,'' they
had ``become little more than signs of the times, lacking true
autonomy, to be decoded according to one's own inclination and
need.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of turning the Orpheus legend into a compelling
postmodern myth, Rushdie has simply freighted an old story with his
favorite themes and the random detritus of our current celebrity
culture. In trying to write what he has called ``an everything
novel,'' he has produced a strangely hollow book, a book that lacks
both the specificity and the magic that have enlivened his best
work in the past.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Brisk winds from the north will transport chilly, moist air from
the Canadian Maritimes into central and northern New England.
Cloudy skies along with a few flurries are expected in the higher
terrain of Maine. On the coast, sunshine will dominate.
</P>
<P>
   A ridge of high pressure stretching from the Great Lakes to the
eastern Gulf Coast will promote dry and seasonable conditions
across the nation east of the Mississippi River. Ample sunshine
will boost temperatures from very cool readings Monday morning in
the Southeast. Florida will stay sunny with an active breeze.
</P>
<P>
   The storm that brought record rainfall to southern California
last weekend will move through New Mexico Tuesday. Heavy snow is
likely in the Sangre De Cristo mountains and along the Front Range.
Snow showers will linger over the higher terrain near the Four
Corners. Gusty showers and scattered thunderstorms will progress
eastward across the valleys of southern Arizona and New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   A chill rain will soak sections of eastern Colorado, Kansas and
Oklahoma. Showers will develop in Texas and western Louisiana and
Arkansas. A few strong thunderstorms may rumble into west Texas.
Cooler air will follow a front in the Dakotas, but only some clouds
will attend the front.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure building near Vancouver, British Columbia, will
sponsor much more pleasant conditions with abundant sunshine in the
West. Offshore winds will direct dry air to the Pacific coast.
Readings will rise well above seasonal levels from the southern
Cascades to the Central Valley. The Southwest will see fewer clouds
as mild air returns.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Fire Danger
</P>
<P>
   The risk of wildfires has returned to Florida. Last June, the
Florida landscape, which had been waterlogged by recurrent rains
during the winter of 1997-98, withered under relentless spring sun,
setting the stage for wildfires. This spring, little rain has
fallen across the peninsula and sunshine has been plentiful as a
warm ridge of high pressure has held steady several thousand feet
above the ground. As a result, the landscape is tinder dry. On
Monday, in the wake of a cool front, dry breezes spread across the
state, accelerating evaporation rates and heightening the risk of
fires.

A POWER PLAY, FIGURATIVELY SPEAKING, SPANS THE SEINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ With all the symmetry that Parisians love, the Pont des
Arts links the painting and sculpture of the Louvre Museum with the
philosophy and letters of the Institut de France. It is a
footbridge, but a serious bridge nonetheless, its iron arches
resting on stone foundations and 19th-century lampposts adding
elegance to its wide wooden walkway across the Seine.
</P>
<P>
   It is, one might say, an unlikely place to find fierce American
Indian warriors and naked African wrestlers.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, however, the Pont des Arts has been turned into an
open-air 24-hour exhibition space peopled by 68 larger-than-life
sculptures by a 63-year-old Senegalese artist, Ousmane Sow. The
show forms part of a Paris cultural program that presented an
overview of 20th-century sculpture on the Champs-Elysees in 1996
and works by Mark di Suvero on the esplanade of the Invalides in
1997. This time the setting as well as the works is pulling larger
round-the-clock crowds than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The sculptures are all figurative, yet what makes them so
striking, apart from their size and unusual appearance, is the
physical power and movement they evoke, as if they were alive one
moment and frozen the next. Individually and in groups they all
seem intent on telling a story. And through their stories Sow pays
homage to American Indians and to Africans.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which runs through May 20 and is Sow's first
retrospective, presents five of the narrative series he has made
since he turned to sculpture 15 years ago: Nuba wrestlers (1984),
Masai warriors (1988), Zulu warriors (1991), Fulani shepherds
(1993) and the Battle of Little Big Horn (1998), which alone
comprises no fewer than 24 human figures and 11 horses and
represents his most remarkable achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Until now Parisians were unfamiliar with his work. Sow, however,
was hardly unfamiliar with Paris. Born in Dakar, Senegal, in 1935,
he left his native country in 1957 for Paris, where he lived for
the next 25 years. He dreamed of becoming an artist but dropped out
of art school for lack of funds. Instead he qualified as a
physiotherapist and opened a private practice that eventually
earned him a respectable living.
</P>
<P>
   It also taught him everything a sculptor needs to know about the
human body.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he returned to Dakar in the early 1980s, he had
tried his hand at small-scale sculpture without satisfactory
results. Then, in 1984, he discovered photographs of naked Nuba
wrestlers in southern Sudan taken in the late 1960s by Leni
Riefenstahl, Hitler's documentary filmmaker, and he was suddenly
inspired to attack monumental sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   The result seen here includes two muscular tribesmen wrestling,
another two in combat with staffs, a naked woman dancing and a
quiet sculpture of a woman sitting cross-legged as she paints the
body of a kneeling man.
</P>
<P>
   Sow began developing the technique that would enable him to
create figures in movement that are sometimes 9 or 10 feet high but
nonetheless have the hair, eyes, teeth, muscles, clothes and shoes
necessary to make them look human.
</P>
<P>
   Today he uses construction wire to provide the skeleton and then
variously mixes clay, plastic, stone, metal, jute, cloth, plaster
and rubber to shape the figures. Finally the sculptures are coated
in an all-weather substance, the ingredients of which remain his
secret.
</P>
<P>
   After his Nuba wrestlers were shown at the French Cultural
Center in Dakar in 1988, Sow felt encouraged to press on. By the
time he was noticed by the broader art world at Documenta 9 in
Kassel, Germany, in 1992 and again at the 1995 Venice Biennale, he
had created his Masai, Zulu and Fulani series.
</P>
<P>
   With the Masai, his second group, Sow introduced animals, as in
``Blood Drinker With Bull,'' in which a tribesman is bleeding the
neck of a bull while trying to control its head-tossing resistance.
</P>
<P>
   He was also drawn to create peaceful images, like a broad-backed
Masai woman breast-feeding a baby, a 10-foot-high Masai warrior
standing guard with a spear and decorated shield, a Peul woman
tending her man's hair and a Peul couple courting shyly. Yet it is
in movement that he excels: a Zulu warrior bedecked in animal skins
about to throw a spear, a young Peul tribesman wrestling a bullock
and a Masai woman in a trance, standing on her tiptoes as if about
to fall, her head thrown back and her eyes rolling wildly.
</P>
<P>
   Sow, a tall white-haired man with a jovial manner, recounts that
he creates his sculptures without prior sketches, guided only by
his imagination. ``I do not seek anatomical exactitude,'' he
explained. ``In order for energy to express itself, whether from
humans or material, doesn't it need to be tortured in some way?''
</P>
<P>
   More surprisingly perhaps, he has never visited any of the
African tribes that he has portrayed. In the case of ``Little Big
Horn,'' though, he read all he could about the 1876 battle where
the Seventh Cavalry Regiment was defeated _ and Col. George A.
Custer was killed _ by Sioux and Cheyenne forces under Crazy Horse,
Sitting Bull, Two Moon and Gall.
</P>
<P>
   In the center of the Pont des Arts, scenes from that battle are
presented like a giant mise en scene, its fury, falling bodies and
dead horses reminiscent, in the view of one French art critic, of
Picasso's ``Guernica.''
</P>
<P>
   At one end Sitting Bull sits in prayer, his hands held high, his
head looking upward; at the other end a uniformed Army bugler seems
to be calling for help. In the middle the battle rages.
</P>
<P>
   At one moment two soldiers stand back to back, pistols in hand,
trying to hold off one muscular Indian who holds a bow and arrow
and another firing from a staggering horse. In another scene a
soldier with a knife in his hand is wrestling an Indian to the
ground. Custer's own death is also imagined: as an Indian fires at
him, he falls, captured, as his left hand touches the ground, his
head thrown back, the pistol in his right hand no longer able to
save him.
</P>
<P>
   Sow's work seems to owe little to Africa's tradition of carving
wooden masks and statues and in many ways is closer to the
sculpture of, say, Rodin, Maillol and Bourdelle, which he was able
to study during his long years in Paris. Yet it is the raw strength
of Africa, which he also projects onto the American Indians, that
distinguishes it from anything done in the West.
</P>
<P>
   His daring also includes the fact that as a Muslim he has risked
criticism simply by representing human figures, something that is
supposedly prohibited by Islam. But he is unfazed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Prophet's concern was with idolatry, not sculpture,'' he
said. ``I include no fetishism in my pieces. A sculpture is a work
that can awaken emotion, but never an object that should be prayed
to.''

 &HT;    Black College Reunion ends amid violence
 &HT;    By Ernie Suggs
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ If Daytona Beach can serve as any kind of
guide, Atlanta can look forward to a quieter Freaknik this year _
at least until the final hours.
</P>
<P>
   After coasting through a weekend of relative calm, with few
arrests and the occasional gridlock, Black College Reunion exploded
here early Sunday morning with two shootings _ one of them fatal _
and at least two stabbings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last night is always the worst,'' said Bobby Geter, on his
way back to Ohio. ``When you have all that alcohol mixed with women
not wearing much clothes, you get a volatile mix.''
</P>
<P>
   Vada York, a graduate student at the University of South
Carolina, said the problems she saw late at the BCR here were no
different than what she has seen by attending the last two
Freakniks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens is that people come to these things expecting
something to happen,'' said York, a native of Sumter, S.C. ``When
nothing happens, they get anxious and try to force the issue. That
is when you get fights, women getting attacked, people getting
shot. It's crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Monica White, a sociologist at Bethune-Cookman College who
specializes in group dynamics, said a number of contributing
factors can lead to sudden violence, including drugs and alcohol,
hot weather, sexual innuendo and machismo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer the weekend goes, the more people come and those
are more people doing nothing. That whole climate leads to people
doing things they don't normally do,'' said White. ``I would also
venture to say that most of these people are not college
students.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said an argument over a spilled drink led to the shooting
death of 28-year-old Craig Grover, of Jacksonville, who, along with
Ansie Pierre, 24, were shot at around 4 a.m. Sunday morning. The
two did not know each other and were not college students.
</P>
<P>
   But while trying not to downplay the weekend's shootings and
stabbings, local officials contend this year's event went
relatively smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a really good crowd,'' said Sherri Davis of the Daytona
Police Department. ``When you have as many people as we had trying
to get into such a small space, two shootings and a stabbing aren't
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Halifax Medical Center spokesperson Kate Holcomb said Pierre
remained in serious condition in the hospital's injury intensive
care unit.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Sunday morning shooting, BCR had been rather calm as
a heavy police presence minimized traffic gridlock and the area's
wide open spaces gave everyone room to cruise either on the beach
or Atlantic Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of BCR's more vocal opponents admitted that this
year's event had a gentler tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt the behavior was better this time,'' said Frank
Heckman, president of the Beachside Neighborhood Watch, an
association of more than 1,200 residents. ``The shootings and
stabbings were domestic violence. People fighting over boyfriends.
This will happen anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said while more than 100,000 people showed up for BCR this
year, there were only about 330 arrests, including 19 arrests for
carrying guns and only 44 arrests involving college students. About
1,100 traffic tickets were given out.
</P>
<P>
   ``These types of events give college students a bad rap,'' said
Clarence Childs, vice president of Bethune-Cookman College, where
BCR was born 15 years ago. ``I think the college students feel they
have much more at stake. They have futures and they don't want to
jeopardize it by doing something stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   That has also been one of the lingering concerns about Freaknik
in Atlanta. Although it is designed for college students, Freaknik
_ officially known as Black College Spring Break _ attracts mostly
locals and people who aren't in college.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the weekend, Daytona Beach Mayor Bud Asher and City
Manager Carey Smith walked the streets talking and getting their
pictures taken with students, at times even helping to direct
traffic. At about 2:30 a.m. Sunday, right after a rap concert had
been shut down because of on-stage obscenities, nudity and
lewdness, Asher was cautiously optimistic about the weekend's final
hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it stays like this, we will be happy campers, because we
haven't had any major public safety fiascoes,'' Asher said at the
time. ``But we still have a few hours left.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Asher was speaking from experience. At the 1998 BCR
here, police shot and killed a man who had opened fire on them on
the final day of the event.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's Freaknik, which by the final Sunday had spilled onto
Auburn Avenue for the Sweet Auburn Festival, saw increased
incidents of violence toward women, who were chased by young men,
stripped of their clothes and fondled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at Freaknik last year and the longer it went, the worse
it got,'' said Joyce Early, who was sunbathing with York Monday
afternoon. ``I remember I had on a pair of sweats and these guys
tried to rush me. We were (at Woodruff Park) in bright daylight.
They won't see me this year.''

 &HT;    WAR DOESN'T STOP POLITICAL FUND-RAISING
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington category and (p) national political
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation is at war in the Balkans, but that has
not diverted top politicians from returning to business-as-usual,
including the ever intensifying hunt for cash.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton goes back on the fund-raising trail Friday,
passing the hat for Democrats in Detroit and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was an initial feeling that it was not
appropriate in the very beginning,'' presidential political adviser
Ann Lewis said Monday. ``But once it's clear that we are in this,
and -- as the president has said -- we're going to continue this,
then we go back to his regular schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of his regular schedule, as a leader of his party, is to
help party committees raise funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's Detroit and Boston appearances this week are joint
Senate-House campaign committee fund-raisers. They will follow a
trip to San Francisco, where Clinton is to address a convention of
the American Society of Newspaper Editors on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The trip is part of the effort by the White House to provide an
appearance of normalcy in which the president is deliberately
indicating he is not consumed by the Kosovo crisis. On Saturday,
Clinton talked about welfare reform in his regular radio address.
He also has an economic address planned for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   However the fund-raising travel drew criticism Monday from
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think Bill Clinton would be spending his time figuring
out what he wants to do in Kosovo, how it is he wants to to do it
and why and when, instead of having his hand out to fat cat
contributors,'' said Mike Collins, spokesman for the Republican
National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Republican National Chairman Jim Nicholson criticized
Clinton for planning a three-state fund-raising trip that was to
have begun March 25, the day after the bombing campaign started in
the Balkans. The White House canceled that trip.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton won't be alone in looking for cash this week. With
Congress returning from a two-week break, members will resume their
efforts to fill campaign chests. Among them, more than a dozen
House Republicans will host receptions, breakfasts and other
events.
</P>
<P>
   Collins defended lawmakers for their fund-raising-as-usual.
``Congressional Republicans are not the commander-in-chief of the
armed forces of a country at war,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether it was appropriate for lawmakers to have recessed
just as the conflict began, Collins said Congress had a
``previously scheduled work period'' and that the president could
have asked them to return to work.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Collins said, ``It's important that the Congress get
the views of the American people'' on the war over Kosovo.

TAKE THE WORK OUT OF PICKING A JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Wednesday, April 14)  
(mk 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes, usually after forgetting to take her medication, a
teacher will invite me to school to give career advice to her
journalism students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be a plumber,'' is what I always tell them.
</P>
<P>
   But now, after reading the ``Jobs Rated Almanac,'' it turns out
that I've been giving these impressionable young people bad advice.
</P>
<P>
   I should have been telling them to be an undertaker, a janitor,
a piano tuner or, if they really want to shoot high, a foot doctor.
</P>
<P>
   According to the almanac, which rated the 250 best and worst
jobs in the country, plumbers actually have lousier jobs (210th on
the list) than newspaper reporters (176th).
</P>
<P>
   Using statistics from the U.S. Department of Labor, the census,
professional organizations and telephone surveys, author Les Krantz
ranked the jobs according to these variables: income, stress,
physical demands, potential growth, job security, work environment
and number of frisky interns cavorting about the office.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I'm making that last part up, which could explain why
the job of president of the United States was ranked 229th on the
list. (The reasons the author gives for the low ranking include no
room for job growth, lots of stress and a stagnant salary. No
mention of angry first ladies hurling ashtrays at your head, but
presumably that is a drawback, too.)
</P>
<P>
   The best job in the United States, according to the almanac, is
Web site manager, possibly for the reason that few people have the
slightest idea what a Web site manager is or does. (How much
management does a Web site need anyway? Are some quiet and
industrious while others spend all day talking about baseball and
making personal phone calls? Would you be able to distinguish one
from the other?) With nothing to do and no one confident enough to
tell him or her to do it, Web site managers have lots of free time
to nap and play computer solitaire, interrupted only by loud thumps
announcing the arrival of the next fat paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   The next best job you can have is that of actuary. This is
someone who is paid upwards of $100,000 a year for sitting in a
posh office dreaming up new ways to cancel my car and homeowner's
insurance. (A couple of years ago someone rear-ended my wife's car
while she was stopped at a red light. A few months later, someone
broke into her car and stole her radio. A few months after that she
showed the incredibly bad judgment of allowing someone to plow into
her parked car while she was inside our house eating breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   (I've been told that an actuary actually pulled a hamstring in
his mad rush to cancel my wife's car insurance. The insurance
industry is even more competitive these days, of course, to the
point that irresponsible breakfast-eaters like my wife would not
only have their insurance canceled but would also be arrested,
fined and beaten with rubber truncheons.)
</P>
<P>
   The worst job you can have, even worse than a newspaper reporter
or plumber or sewage plant operator (163rd on the list; one better
than the job of teacher), is that of an oil field roustabout. This
is bad news for parents like me who try to scare their kids into
getting better grades by telling them they're headed for a career
as a french fry cook at McDonald's. According to the almanac, cooks
rank No. 172, four places better than a newspaper reporter and 78
places better than an oilfield roustabout, which is a cool-sounding
job but is probably dirty and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   (``Get those grades up, young man, or you're going to be writing
newspaper columns in the middle of the stinking desert with oil
shooting up your nose! And no interns, either!'')
</P>
<P>
   Other jobs you want to deter your kid from going after include
major league baseball player (No. 202), NBA basketball player (No.
205) and NFL football player (No. 211). These low rankings come
despite the fact that the average salary of a professional baseball
or basketball player is over $1.4 million. Perhaps the stress and
physical demands of carrying around that much money make these jobs
undesirable, I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton will want to get into a better line of work
when he leaves office so he might consider becoming a parole
officer (No. 12) or a dental hygienist (No. 22).
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, he could be a Web site manager who cleans teeth in
his spare time and on weekends dreams up new ways to cancel my
wife's car insurance.
</P>
<P>
   That would be sweet.

SAVING THE HUMAN DETAILS OF JEROME ROBBINS' ART

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The studio where Jerome Robbins danced out his ideas before
rehearsals was filled with packing boxes. Posters, photographs and
costume and set sketches were propped up against the pristine white
walls and wall-length mirror in this top-floor room of Robbins'
handsome, austere Upper East Side town house.
</P>
<P>
   The air resonated with murmurs of ``Oh, look at this!'' one
recent afternoon as artifacts of Robbins' work and life were
examined and tagged for delivery to a new destination.
</P>
<P>
   The choreographer, who died last year, bequeathed his personal
archives to the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts and
its dance collection, one of the world's major research collections
on dance. The announcement of the gift was made Monday by the
library's president, Dr. Paul LeClerc, at ``Broadway Celebrates
Jerome Robbins,'' a tribute at the Majestic Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins, whom LeClerc described as ``one of the best friends''
of the library, helped the dance collection establish its huge film
and video archive in 1964 with an endowment supported by a
percentage of his royalties from the Broadway musical ``Fiddler on
the Roof.''
</P>
<P>
   With this new Jerome Robbins Collection, the library has
acquired more than 100 boxes of materials and more than 30 file
drawers filled with business papers pertaining to his shows and
ballets, all neatly labeled with titles as dry as ``shows'' and
``contracts'' and as tantalizingly mysterious as ``Exception and
the Rule'' and ``The Misha Project.'' ``Fiddler'' alone has 54
folders. An additional gift of related materials has been made by
Dr. Daniel Stern, a friend of Robbins.
</P>
<P>
   ``This collection will be a reminder of the broad scope of
Robbins' remarkable abilities,'' said Madeleine Nichols, curator of
the dance collection. ``We forget that. Any collection does that.
But Robbins was one of the major creators of our century.''
</P>
<P>
   She estimates that it will take at least two years to catalog
the material, although researchers will be able to use materials as
they become available. Part of the collection, 24 volumes of
journals with entries from 1971 to 1982, will not be available to
the public for 13 to 15 years, as stipulated in Robbins' will.
</P>
<P>
   Such personal collections provide what LeClerc calls ``the most
direct, reliable and precise kinds of insight into the individual
artist's creative process.'' Even a cursory look during the packing
yielded immediate insights into the character, life and thought of
that famously private man.
</P>
<P>
   Jostling for space with framed costume sketches from ``West Side
Story'' and a photograph of Robbins as a slightly wary-looking
toddler on a tricycle, blown up as an undated birthday tribute
signed by theater and society friends, was a sketchbook whose odd
drawings yielded a gold mine of poignantly suggestive information.
</P>
<P>
   Notes in pencil and ink, written in a meticulous, cramped hand,
lined the back of two sketch pages dated October 1969 and labeled
``Goldberg Variations _ Aria.'' ``The Goldberg Variations'' was
created for the New York City Ballet, where Robbins was for many
years a resident choreographer, and was first performed in 1971.
``These drawings were done while leg was in cast with ruptured
Achilles tendon _ couldn't dance or search or demonstrate,''
Robbins wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The next paragraph is addressed to Bob, presumably the City
Ballet musical director, Robert Irving: ``These aren't choreography
_ or floor patterns _ just doodles to help me feel out or parse out
my own impulses to the music because I can't get up and do them
myself. The final dance will contain some of the essences of what
they mean to me _ but I doubt if they'd make any sense to anyone
else. Also _ the dance will (italics)never(end italics) have the
harshness of these line drawings.''
</P>
<P>
   There are amusing notes from two of Robbins' musical-theater
colleagues. After a trip to England in 1967 to fine-tune a London
production of ``Fiddler,'' the composer Jerry Bock reassures
Robbins that ``the show, over all, is in damn good shape ... and
they all seem happy to have some American Jews kvetching.''
</P>
<P>
   An inexpert oil portrait of Robbins by Irving Berlin in 1982 is
explained by the letter accompanying it. ``I started painting but
quickly discovered that as a painter I was still a pretty good
songwriter,'' Berlin writes. ``Occasionally, I wind up with a face
that resembles one of my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins seems to have started saving everything for posterity
early in his career. One letter reveals an unexpected degree of
hero worship. ``This is a big fan letter and it is really just part
of a continuity of enormous admiration I've had for you and your
work spanning the years from `Flying Down to Rio' to today,''
Robbins wrote to Fred Astaire on June 20, 1974, in a letter
distilled from four carefully edited drafts, all filed with the
finished product and with Astaire's polite, considerably shorter
response.
</P>
<P>
   Writing just after he had seen ``Follow the Fleet'' and
``Carefree,'' Robbins continues: ``I haven't had such a fine time
at the movies in ages. The pure artistry, the sense of delight and
exhilaration, plus the true thrilling quality of your work has
lifted me up on a beautiful high for days. But even more was the
confirmation of something I've always felt, and that is how
(italics)deeply(end italics) influential and inspiring to my own
career and work you have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins ends by thanking Astaire, somewhat shyly, on behalf of
himself and ``the millions of us all over the world'' for ``the
beautiful gift of joy, the belief that living is lovely and that
man is good.''

SCHROEDER ELECTED CHAIRMAN OF SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder was elected chairman of
the Social Democratic Party Monday, but the margin of his victory
clearly reflected some uneasiness over Germany's participation in
NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   At a party congress in Bonn called to elect a replacement for
Oskar Lafontaine, the former finance minister and Social Democratic
Party leader who quit politics last month, Schroeder gained 76
percent of the vote in an uncontested ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The vote followed a vigorous speech by Schroeder in which he
said that ``the genocide in Yugoslavia cannot be met with
pacifism'' and that Germany must stand by the ethnic Albanian
``victims of expulsion, rape and murder.''
</P>
<P>
   The chancellor's words did not by any means convince all the
delegates of a party whose pacifist wing resisted the deployment of
Pershing missiles on German soil in the 1980's and continues to
regard war as inherently wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``This NATO military operation is based on the age-old
misconception that there is such a thing as a just war,'' said
Henning Voscheran, one of the party delegates. But a motion from
his wing of the party demanding an immediate cease-fire was
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Before the vote, Schroeder made it clear that he would be
satisfied with 80 percent backing. He thus fell short of his
target, as close to one quarter of the delegates voted against him.
The vote was 370 in favor, 102 against, and 15 abstentions. Of all
postwar Social Democratic leaders, only Lafontaine in 1995 was
elected with a smaller majority.
</P>
<P>
   After three weeks of bombing, opinion polls show that about
two-thirds of Germans support the country's participation in the
NATO attacks. But in a country whose postwar mantra was long that
``only peace'' would go out from German soil, the return to war
remains a sharply divisive issue.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, Schroeder's ``Red Green'' coalition of Social
Democrats and Greens has argued that Germany had two guiding
doctrines after the fall of Hitler's Reich: no more war, and no
more genocide. In the Balkans, the two have come into conflict, and
the government has decided that the latter principle must take
precedence.
</P>
<P>
   Both Schroeder and his Green foreign minister, Joshka Fischer,
have been firm in defending Germany's role in the NATO attacks,
repeatedly using very harsh language to describe the acts of the
Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic. But uneasiness in both
governing parties is still evident.
</P>
<P>
   The vote Monday made Schroeder the Social Democratic Party's
eighth chairman since World War II and the first since Willy Brandt
to be chancellor and party leader at the same time. In theory, he
should now be in a stronger position to push through reforms aimed
at deregulating the German economy that the left wing of his party
opposes.

IMPEACHMENT VOTE ON YELTSIN POSTPONED 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian parliamentary leaders voted Monday to delay
indefinitely a planned vote on the impeachment of President Boris
Yeltsin, stepping back from another showdown between the Kremlin
and the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   But the postponement was only half a victory for Yeltsin, who
recently said that he would prefer to have the issue removed from
the political agenda once and for all, preferably by its defeat in
the opposition-dominated lower house of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, which had been set for Thursday, had added suspense to
a political debate that in the last month has been electrified by
the war in the Balkans, a series of ugly sex-and-corruption
scandals and the Kremlin's own behind-the-scenes maneuvering.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual television address last Saturday, Prime Minister
Yevgeni M. Primakov urged the Parliament not to take up the
impeachment issue which he said was groundless and
counterproductive. ``Such political games are irresponsible and
dangerous,'' he said. ``They may not only rock society but provoke
a grave political crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Primakov and his government became targets in the crossfire
between Yeltsin and his parliamentary opposition as the Kremlin
fanned speculation that the president might fire his prime
minister, and then go on to disband the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   None of this has happened but at a public meeting last Friday,
Yeltsin hinted broadly that Primakov's hold on his job was not
guaranteed. ``At this stage, Primakov is useful,'' Yeltsin said
sourly. ``Later, we shall see.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Primakov gave his own caustic reply. ``I am not
clinging to or holding on to my chair of prime minister, especially
since a time frame for my work is being set,'' he said on
television. ``Today I am needed, and tomorrow we'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   The opposition-dominated lower house voted last year to
investigate five articles of impeachment against Yeltsin, ranging
from the illegal dissolution of the Soviet Union to the
``genocide'' of the Russian people to the waging of an illegal war
in the breakaway region of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Of these five charges, the one about the war in Chechnya was
considered the most likely to succeed since it would attract votes
not only from Yeltin's hard-core left-wing opposition, but also
from liberal members of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   But even so, last-minute head-counts were putting the total a
few votes shy of 300, the margin required in the 450-seat chamber
to send the impeachment proceedings on their tortuous route. Under
the Russian Constitution, an impeachment vote must be upheld first
by the Russian Supreme Court, then by the Constitutional Court, and
finally confirmed by the Parliament's upper house, the Federation
Council.
</P>
<P>
   The chances of clearing these hurdles before Yeltsin's term ends
in the summer of 2000 are exceedingly small. But a vote to impeach
would damage the president's already weakened political position.
More important, it would prevent him from disbanding the
Parliament, which the Constitution forbids him from doing once a
vote to impeach has been taken.
</P>
<P>
   In delaying the vote, some parliamentary leaders said they
wanted more time to adopt amendments to impeachments procedures, in
particular so as to allow the vote to be taken by open, rather than
secret, ballot. The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri Yakushkin, said the
vote was delayed because the opposition did not have the votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever rhetoric one may use to justify this decision, it is
clear that they fear the entire impeachment procedure initiated by
the lower house may fail,'' Yakushkin told the news agency
Interfax.

 &HT;    Wohlers ready to move on
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The decision was not made lightly. Mark Wohlers is
leaving the only baseball organization he has ever known.
</P>
<P>
   He has no idea where his life is leading. The lone certainty
comes at 2 p.m. Friday, when the Atlanta Braves' rights to the
29-year-old relief pitcher expire.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Wohlers told the Braves that he would not accept an
assignment to Atlanta's Triple-A minor-league team in Richmond. The
Braves, who will release Wohlers if they are unable make a trade,
still will owe him $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the ultimate decision was (that) I think I've tapped
as many resources as I can in this organization,'' Wohlers said
from his Alpharetta home on Monday. ``I just think, for personal
and professional reasons, that this is best for me to get a new
start. I tried the Richmond thing, and it didn't work out. Several
people very close to me _ the therapist I've been working with _
have said that just going back there just kind of repeats history.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the biggest thing,'' Wohlers said. ``I felt like I
had a great spring. If not a great spring, considering where I was
coming from, I would classify (it) as being close to great. Then 10
days ago, I threw the hell out of the ball in the exhibition game,
and I just think I'm too close.''
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers hasn't been a Brave for half his life. It's actually
been only 40 percent of his life, since the club plucked him as a
bony 18-year-old kid out of Holyoke (Mass.) High School. It would
take him six years before he stuck in Atlanta for good and still
another season before the team gave him the closer's job.
</P>
<P>
   He, Tom Glavine, John Smoltz and Otis Nixon, who returned this
year after five seasons away, are the only Braves remaining from
the 1991 worst-to-first run. No player in any league in recent
history had his problems so publicly scrutinized. If some in the
Braves clubhouse were shocked when the team designated him Friday
for another minor-league assignment, Wohlers say he was not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know something obviously needed to be done,'' he said. ``You
know, I don't blame them for having to make this decision. It's
unfortunate that it's ended this way. It's been a heck of a run for
me, back since 1991. There's nothing more I could have hoped for
than to be able to contribute to this organization's winning
another championship. But it's just not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   During spring training, Wohlers seemed to have reclaimed his
form. Two days before the season began, he retired Cleveland's
Richie Sexson, David Justice and Alex Ramirez in order with the
same dominance he owned in his best seasons. Barely 48 hours later,
he walked four of the first seven Philadelphia Phillies he faced in
the opener.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night was worse: two walks and an error in three
batters. If anything, his first-week collapse was more horrific
than his slow, steady decline of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what happened was that when the bell rang, I didn't
allow myself to make mistakes,'' Wohlers said. ``I wanted to be
perfect. That's part of this. You walk in after going through what
I went through, the ovations and support that I got, you don't want
to let people down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I put too much pressure on myself to meet other
people's expectations, instead of just realizing what my own
expectations should be. If I walk a guy or two, it's no big deal. I
should still be able to get out of it, instead of saying out on the
mound, 'Oh-oh.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what had happened, too, is, there was a pattern being
set. When I had my first BP session in spring training, it was
shaky, and then things got better after that BP. When I had my
first exhibition outing in spring training, it was shaky, and then
things got better. And I was anticipating the same thing happening
here. A lot of people were. A lot of people I spoke to in the
organization and outside the organization said there was a pattern
being set, so be prepared. I have no doubts. Ten days ago when we
played Cleveland, I'm throwing the ball 97, 98 (mph) and hitting
the strike zone with an 88-, 89-mph split.''
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers and Seth Levinson, his New York-based agent, have
reviewed different scenarios for how this week might work out but
neither knows for sure. While he exercised the ultimate control by
refusing the Braves assignment, Wohlers has no control over what
happens in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   That uncertainty was weighed against what happens with his next
team. He is in the final, $5.2 million year of his contract, and an
option buyout can be worth $800,000 in 2000. But his decision to
leave the Braves has has much to do with his past here as with his
future elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what was going to happen next year,'' Wohlers
said. ``With my contract being up, was I going to have to start
with a new organization next year? I felt, if that was going to
happen and I was going to go to Richmond now, then maybe there's an
opportunity where I can pitch in the minor leagues for someone
else. Maybe I'd have an opportunity to come back and pitch in the
big leagues this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knew the writing was on the wall, that my chances
for coming back next year were slim. Not by my choice, but by the
way things were working out.''
</P>
<P>
   He leaves with another extended round of thanks for the Braves
organization, from owner Ted Turner to manager Bobby Cox, for the
club's support throughout his struggle. But that allegiance leaves
the Braves holding that $6 million bill for what Wohlers is still
owed, an awkward final chapter of what has become an awkward tale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thought a great deal about that,'' he said. ``I've asked
several people, because there's a guilt factor. Somebody told me,
``If you had a kid who was in the same situation, what advice would
you give him?'' Part of signing a long-term deal is the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   And if Mark Wohlers is leading the majors in anything, it must
be risk.

in cooperation with the PBS program Frontline, has found him to be
less a commander of terrorists than an inspiration for them.

But the jury, in its third day of deliberations, deadlocked on two
other counts of criminal contempt and the judge, George Howard Jr.,

 (Has sidebar slugged Skate-Speak) For use NYTimes News Service

By PHIL DAVIS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Eleven-year-old Michael Donato practices kick
flips, pop shove-its and other skateboard moves right on the living
room coffee table.
</P>
<P>
   And his mom doesn't even blink.
</P>
<P>
   It helps that Michael's skateboard is only about 4 inches long _
a hot new toy called a fingerboard. Boys across the nation are
snapping up the miniature boards for $6 to $12 a pop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really big,'' Michael said. ``A really lot of people are
into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers' desk drawers are beginning to bear the weight of this
new trend. The space for confiscated contraband that not so long
ago was occupied by the likes of beeping Tamagotchis and
collectible pogs today is filling with fingerboards and their tiny
paraphernalia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we are getting them,'' said Larry Meyer, dean of eighth
grade at George Ellery Hale Middle School in Woodland Hills. ``It's
just another item that's dealt with as a nuisance. The teachers
take them away and send them to the deans. We require the student
to bring a note from home that says, `I realize they are a
disruption and I will keep them at home.' Then we return it. I'm
sure in a couple more months, when it gets hot, it will be squirt
guns. These things come and go in cycles.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't be so sure it's just a passing fancy, say toy store
owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that's very playable for a lot of kids. Even if
they can't ride a skateboard, at least they can play with these,''
said Chris Quenga, who works at Acta Game Guys in Van Nuys. ``A lot
of kids come in here asking for Tech Decks and we have to tell them
we're out of stock. Every time we get them, they go right out the
door.''
</P>
<P>
   And fingerboard makers know how to milk a trend. Like Matchbox
cars and Beanie Babies, these toys are collectible.
</P>
<P>
   Escondido-based toy manufacturer X-Concepts, the makers of Tech
Decks, have gone as far as securing licenses to duplicate _ in
miniature _ the graphics on some of the hottest full-size
skateboards made by companies such as World Industries, Zero and
Birdhouse. There are 208 different Tech Deck fingerboards on the
market, and more on the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fingerboards have been around since the '80s,'' explains
X-Concepts co-owner Tom Davidson. ``What we did with Tech Decks is
work to make them as realistic as possible. The graphics are the
real graphics they put on real skateboards. They're a step ahead of
what's been out there for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidson's fingerboards feature real metal trucks (the part that
holds the wheels on), grip tape, bushing and wheels. They also come
with tiny tool kits so kids can customize the wheels and trucks
just like on real skateboards; the tiny parts make fingerboards an
ages-9-and-up toy.
</P>
<P>
   Fingerboards also raise the need for a full complement of
accessories: mini concave ramps, tiny staircases and even
finger-size park benches and picnic tables.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's always the equally hard-to-find wad of wax that
helps fingertips stick to the boards during flipping, twisting and
other split-second maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   All the better to do tricks with.
</P>
<P>
   And that, say kids on the cutting edge, is the real fun of
fingerboards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tech Decks are cool on the bottom, but doing stuff is a lot
more fun than just looking at them,'' said Michael.
</P>
<P>
   His current favorite, in fact, is not one of the realistically
decorated Tech Deck boards but a plain, plastic demo model he got
from a couple of guys who were at a local toy store demonstrating
fingerboard tricks.
</P>
<P>
   The board doesn't look as realistic as a Tech Deck, but its
plastic top helps fingers stick to the board, and that makes tricks
easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tech Decks are really big now, but when these come out,''
Michael said, holding up his demo board like an old pro making
market predictions, ``the Tech Decks are out.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, again, there's a solution to every problem, and Michael's
on to one: finger shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Just like skateboard shoes help skaters stick to the grip tape
on their boards, something similar for little fingers would make it
a lot easier to do tricks with Tech Decks.
</P>

   LOS ANGELES _ Eleven-year-old Michael Donato practices kick
flips, pop shove-its and other skateboard moves right on the living
room coffee table.
</P>
<P>
   And his mom doesn't even blink.
</P>
<P>
   It helps that Michael's skateboard is only about 4 inches long _
a hot new toy called a fingerboard. Boys across the nation are
snapping up the miniature boards for $6 to $12 a pop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really big,'' Michael said. ``A really lot of people are
into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers' desk drawers are beginning to bear the weight of this
new trend. The space for confiscated contraband that not so long
ago was occupied by the likes of beeping Tamagotchis and
collectible pogs today is filling with fingerboards and their tiny
paraphernalia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we are getting them,'' said Larry Meyer, dean of eighth
grade at George Ellery Hale Middle School in Woodland Hills. ``It's
just another item that's dealt with as a nuisance. The teachers
take them away and send them to the deans. We require the student
to bring a note from home that says, `I realize they are a
disruption and I will keep them at home.' Then we return it. I'm
sure in a couple more months, when it gets hot, it will be squirt
guns. These things come and go in cycles.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't be so sure it's just a passing fancy, say toy store
owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that's very playable for a lot of kids. Even if
they can't ride a skateboard, at least they can play with these,''
said Chris Quenga, who works at Acta Game Guys in Van Nuys. ``A lot
of kids come in here asking for Tech Decks and we have to tell them
we're out of stock. Every time we get them, they go right out the
door.''
</P>
<P>
   And fingerboard makers know how to milk a trend. Like Matchbox
cars and Beanie Babies, these toys are collectible.
</P>
<P>
   Escondido-based toy manufacturer X-Concepts, the makers of Tech
Decks, have gone as far as securing licenses to duplicate _ in
miniature _ the graphics on some of the hottest full-size
skateboards made by companies such as World Industries, Zero and
Birdhouse. There are 208 different Tech Deck fingerboards on the
market, and more on the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fingerboards have been around since the '80s,'' explains
X-Concepts co-owner Tom Davidson. ``What we did with Tech Decks is
work to make them as realistic as possible. The graphics are the
real graphics they put on real skateboards. They're a step ahead of
what's been out there for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidson's fingerboards feature real metal trucks (the part that
holds the wheels on), grip tape, bushing and wheels. They also come
with tiny tool kits so kids can customize the wheels and trucks
just like on real skateboards; the tiny parts make fingerboards an
ages-9-and-up toy.
</P>
<P>
   Fingerboards also raise the need for a full complement of
accessories: mini concave ramps, tiny staircases and even
finger-size park benches and picnic tables.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's always the equally hard-to-find wad of wax that
helps fingertips stick to the boards during flipping, twisting and
other split-second maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   All the better to do tricks with.
</P>
<P>
   And that, say kids on the cutting edge, is the real fun of
fingerboards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tech Decks are cool on the bottom, but doing stuff is a lot
more fun than just looking at them,'' said Michael.
</P>
<P>
   His current favorite, in fact, is not one of the realistically
decorated Tech Deck boards but a plain, plastic demo model he got
from a couple of guys who were at a local toy store demonstrating
fingerboard tricks.
</P>
<P>
   The board doesn't look as realistic as a Tech Deck, but its
plastic top helps fingers stick to the board, and that makes tricks
easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tech Decks are really big now, but when these come out,''
Michael said, holding up his demo board like an old pro making
market predictions, ``the Tech Decks are out.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, again, there's a solution to every problem, and Michael's
on to one: finger shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Just like skateboard shoes help skaters stick to the grip tape
on their boards, something similar for little fingers would make it
a lot easier to do tricks with Tech Decks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoes for your fingers,'' Michael said, laughing. ``That'd be
funny.'' &QL;

LINGO OF FINGERBOARDERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PHIL DAVIS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
LOS ANGELES _ Fingerboarders use the skateboard vernacular. Here is
some common skatespeak terminology:
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Deck &LR; : The board in skateboard. It's curved at both ends. The
deck is usually adorned on the bottom with a design or cartoon that
reflects the attitude and style of the skater. Skaters are mostly
teen boys, so the designs are usually sinister or gross. For
example: a homicidal skunk wielding a bloody skull-knife.
</P>
<P>
   T &UR; rucks &LR; : The metal things that attach the wheels to the deck.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Nose &LR; : The front curve of the deck.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tail &LR; : The deck's back curve.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ollie &LR; : The most basic skate trick _ basically popping the
board up with the back foot _ or finger _ and then shifting forward
to front for a flat landing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ollie flip &LR; : An Ollie, but the board flips end over end before
the skater lands on it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Kick flip &LR; : A good one for fingerboards. Like the name says,
the skater kicks the board into an end-over-end flip _ 180 or 360
degrees _ so it lands back on its wheels.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 50/50 grind &LR; : Using the Ollie to pop up and skid along a curb
or, for the tiny fingerboard, something smaller, like a geography
book.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pop  &LR; s &UR; hove-it &LR; : Flipping the board 180 degrees to bring the
back to the front, or vice versa.

DICK TRICKLE HAS WON FANS, BUT NOT RACES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CHRIS WINSTON   
 Spartanburg, S.C., Herald-Journal   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRISTOL, Tenn. _ Dick Trickle has won more than 1,200 races over
a 40-year driving career, but is known as one of racing's biggest
losers.
</P>
<P>
   He makes commercials that joke about his zero career Winston Cup
victories and show him getting hit in the head with a Frisbee.
</P>
<P>
   He demonstrates his sense of humor by sneaking up on other
drivers and grabbing them around the neck and by inviting himself
over to eat lunch in their trailers when he gets hungry.
</P>
<P>
   After four tough hours of racing Sunday at Bristol Motor
Speedway, he forced his crew members to break into smiles with a
deadly serious comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I don't know where they got the water in this bottle
in the car,'' Trickle called over the radio after 490 laps. ``But
it's awful.''
</P>
<P>
   Team owner Joe Falk squelched his laughter long enough to reply,
``It must be tap.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is life working with one of NASCAR's biggest supporters,
critics, draws and clowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a lot of fans out there, and we have a lot of fans
because we work with him,'' Falk said. Some of those fans
approached Trickle before Sunday's race. And although time was
short before driver introductions, he gladly stopped to autograph
shirts and papers and have his picture taken.
</P>
<P>
   Trickle does not acknowledge himself as a symbol for the sport,
and even refuses to allow himself to be known as a racing icon.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's an icon?'' asked Trickle, 57, with a smile and a quick
Wisconsin accent.
</P>
<P>
   Things haven't been going well on the track for Trickle recently
and Sunday's Food City 500 was no exception.
</P>
<P>
   A flat tire, being flagged for speeding down pit road, being
caught out of line trying to get to the pits, and pulling into the
wrong pit stall on the final caution were all taken in stride by
Trickle, who finished 31st, some seven laps off the pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Jeff Gordon had a flat, they would have thrown a caution on
the next lap,'' said Trickle, who is usually smoking a cigarette
when he's outside a race car and sometimes in one. ``But at least
that was the only bad thing to happen to us today.''
</P>
<P>
   Falk, trying to be conservative, estimates the team could have
grabbed a top-20 finish as Trickle had moved from 29th up to 25th
in the race's first 10 laps.
</P>
<P>
   It's been 10 years since Trickle, at 48, won the Rookie of the
Year campaign while subbing for the injured Mike Alexander for the
Stavola Brothers. But his NASCAR career goes back another two
decades when Trickle started the 1970 Daytona 500 in his own car
but was unable to finish.
</P>
<P>
   His driving career goes back to Midwestern short tracks, where
he won nine ARTGO championships, more races than he can count _ at
least 1,200 _ and became known as stock car racing's winningest
driver.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's race was his 286th Winston Cup race. Six months ago,
however, Trickle wondered whether he would be driving for anyone
this season. After piloting Junie Donlavey's No. 90 car for 2 1/2
half seasons, Trickle had to leave when the team lost its
sponsorship and a lot of the crew.
</P>
<P>
   Trickle has raced for 21 different Winston Cup owners over his
career.
</P>
<P>
   He climbed into Bill Elliott's second car to try to qualify for
February's Daytona 500, but a 27th-place finish in the 125-mile
qualifier was not enough. He didn't attempt to qualify for the next
three races, but joined up with Falk's team at Darlington, S.C.,
where he qualified 31st for the TranSouth 400. He finished 26th but
then failed to qualify two weeks ago in the Primestar 500 at Texas
Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making the show is an achievement at this stage,'' Trickle
said. ``And finishing a race is an achievement. And we did both
this weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear how much longer Trickle will be with the Falk
team. After next weekend's Goody's Body Pain 500 at Martinsville,
Va., Falk has no sponsorship lined up.
</P>
<P>
   Trickle hasn't finished in the top-20 in points since 1992, even
though he made 32 of 33 races last season and posted a top-10
finish in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   While his professional career has sent him from team to team, he
has been married to his wife, Darlene, for 30 years. The couple
have three children.
</P>
<P>
   Trickle said he wants to race until he finally wins a Winston
Cup race. His string of 286 races without a victory is the
second-longest active streak behind Michael Waltrip's 369 races.
Trickle, however, has finished third in Winston races five times,
most recently in August 1997. And more than 100 races on NASCAR's
Busch Series have netted him two victories, both in the past two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really need to win a Winston Cup race to cap my career off.
I really do. But we've got to get competitive first, and then it
will happen,'' Trickle said. ``It's going to happen when you least
likely expect it. I know that.''

AN OLDER, WISER NEVADA BARR WATCHES HER `ANNA PIGEON' MYSTERIES
TAKE WING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Nevada Barr came to literary prominence late
enough in life to laugh at herself. After a checkered early career
as an actress and national park ranger, she finally had books
published in her late 30s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secret of my success? Sheer dumb luck,'' says Barr, 47,
who stopped at the Fort Worth Star-Telegram during a national tour
promoting ``Liberty Falling,'' her latest bestselling mystery
novel. ``But I'm enjoying it. As they say, I've been poor and
unknown and now I'm sort of rich and famous. I like rich and famous
better.''
</P>
<P>
   But the poor and unknown years gave Barr the imaginary basis of
her eventual success as an author. Anna Pigeon, the protagonist in
Barr's whodunits, is a park ranger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making (Anna) a ranger means I can expose her and my readers
to adventures in the most incredible sites,'' Barr says. ``It
means, when I'm thinking up my plots, that I can start by deciding
which park somebody's body will be found in. I can take everything
else in the story from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Readers are attracted by middle-aged Anna's personal growth.
Barr says that mimics her own life, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as I'd hate to think I wasn't learning new things,
embracing new ideas, well, I'd have no interest in writing about a
character who had to be the exact same person over and over again
in every book,'' Barr says. ``In `Liberty Falling,' for instance,
Anna is placed in the middle of New York City. It's different for
her; she has to learn to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Readers always seem happy to deal with Anna. Barr is on a
one-a-year Anna Pigeon book schedule. Her publisher, Putnam, backs
each with a substantial marketing budget. That means Barr spends a
month or so each year on the road, promoting books. It isn't always
fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like a vacation when you get to go sight-seeing,''
she explains. ``You have interviews, book signings, and then it's
get on the plane to fly to the next place and do it all over again.
But that's the hard part. I still enjoy meeting my readers. They
seem able to differentiate between fiction and real life. They know
Anna is based on me, but that she's not me.''
</P>
<P>
   While Barr tours to promote ``Liberty Falling,'' she has already
finished Anna Pigeon's next adventure and is trying to plot
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm supposed to have a new book out every spring, so I have to
stay focused. I give myself three months off between finishing the
last one and starting the next one.''
</P>
<P>
   When Barr begins a new book, she doesn't overprepare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know most mystery writers sit down and write complex plot
outlines, but I just like to start writing and see what happens,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   After Barr finishes her book tour this week, she'll take some
time for fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a new granddaughter to go look at,'' she says,
beaming. ``And after that, I'm excited about getting back to
Mississippi and staying home for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   But not for too long. After completing another Anna Pigeon
novel, Barr says, she's off on a grand adventure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to go to Nepal,'' she says. ``I wonder if there are
any national parks there for Anna to solve a murder at?''

WILL THE VOICES GROW EVER QUIETER? 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although the death of the American choral conductor Robert Shaw
in January _ at 82, after a number of appearances were canceled in
recent years because of illness _ could not have surprised anyone
in itself, the shock waves have yet to subside. To call it the end
of a generation is mild. Perhaps it is the end of an era.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sort of feels like the roof blew off,'' James Conlon, the
American orchestral and choral conductor, said recently. ``As long
as I've known choral music, he's been there. He was a gigantic
figure, and it feels like a different world without him.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Maclary, a professor of choral studies at Bowling Green
University in Ohio who knew and worked with Shaw, offered another
variation on the familiar theme: ``We're at a continental divide,
looking down.''
</P>
<P>
   By varying accounts, the world of choral music, especially in
the United States, lost a founder, a model, a mentor, a friend, a
father figure _ even, in the words of Kurt Masur, the music
director of the New York Philharmonic, a sort of ``musical priest''
_ when Shaw died on Jan. 25.
</P>
<P>
   How do you replace such an institution? Although there are
promising candidates to pick up some of those roles, there is no
obvious heir to assume them all. One has to wonder whether any
single figure could dominate the field in the same way, now that
the musical scene has become so fragmented and diverse.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, who founded the Collegiate Chorale in 1941, the Robert
Shaw Chorale in 1948 and the Atlanta Symphony Chamber Chorus in
1967, was the foremost figure in a generation that lifted the
standard of choral performance in the United States, if not the
world, to a remarkable new height.
</P>
<P>
   Others were Margaret Hillis, who founded the Chicago Symphony
Chorus and died last year at 76, and Roger Wagner, who founded the
Roger Wagner Chorale and the Los Angeles Master Chorale and died in
1992 at 78.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the landscape of American choral conducting
after Shaw, all the unanimity that greets mention of his name
evaporates. Indirectly, at least, Shaw wielded an influence on
virtually everyone in the field today, and he had a direct impact
on most, through the quality and impact of his performances if not
through actual contact.
</P>
<P>
   His disciples range from the 71-year-old Robert Page, who was
one of Shaw's successors as director of the Cleveland Orchestra
Chorus, from 1971 to 1989, to relative youngsters like Charles
Bruffy, the 40-year-old director of the Kansas City Chorale.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw did not teach conducting as such but worked mostly through
example, presiding over institutes and workshops for specialists in
the field. He might train and conduct an amateur chorus one week
and an ad hoc group of choral directors the next.
</P>
<P>
   It was just such an institute, in France, that turned Bruffy
into a Shaw follower. ``It changed my life,'' Bruffy said. ``My
chorus at home had a whole new sonority after my first experience
with Shaw.'' Bruffy sang in Shaw choruses many times, and although
he was never a part of Shaw's wide circle of friends, he said, ``I
sponged from him as hard as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   Dwindling Number of Specialists
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Page, who directs the Mendelssohn Choir in
Pittsburgh, leaders of the generation or two after Shaw include
Joseph Flummerfelt, the artistic director and principal conductor
of the Westminster Choir College in Princeton, N.J.; Vance George,
the director of the San Francisco Symphony Chorus; John Oliver, the
director of the Tanglewood Festival Chorus in Massachusetts, and
Gregg Smith, the founder of the Gregg Smith Singers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't that many of us anymore with our feet above the
ground,'' said Page, still obviously trying on his new-found status
as elder statesman for size.
</P>
<P>
   Others of great promise were lost early to AIDS: Michael Korn,
who founded the Philadelphia Singers and died in 1991 at 44, and
Thomas Peck, who founded the St. Louis Symphony Chorus and died in
1994 at 56.
</P>
<P>
   Of the younger generation, in addition to Bruffy, Robert Porco,
who teaches at Indiana University and directs the Cleveland
Orchestra Chorus, and Dennis Keene, the director of Ascension Music
in New York, are often mentioned as rising stars.
</P>
<P>
   Other obvious talents are Norman MacKenzie, Shaw's longtime
assistant at the Atlanta Symphony Chorus and elsewhere; Judith
Clurman, who directs choruses in New York, including the Judith
Clurman Chorale, and Amy Kaiser, who leads the St. Louis Symphony
Chorus.
</P>
<P>
   The 45-year-old Keene is the younger leader most widely touted
to pick up Shaw's mantle as not only conductor but also mentor.
Keene started a summer festival last year in Kent, Conn., breaking
the Shaw mold in offering specific instruction in conducting and
singing as well as choral technique.
</P>
<P>
   Even without Shaw, the field of choral conducting is rich.
Perhaps never before has there been such a stock of fine chorus
masters, largely because of Shaw's eagerness to share his methods
and expertise.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't really have students,'' said Keene, who is not
particularly known for a Shaw connection. ``But I did the Shaw bit.
I tagged along, and I sat in on his rehearsals.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet that richness has limits. A distinction must be made,
several directors pointed out, between choral trainers and actual
conductors. Conducting, especially when a full orchestra comes into
play, is a whole other discipline, one that Shaw took pains to
master as few others have.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a certain point, he decided to concentrate on orchestral
conducting as well,'' Flummerfelt said. ``There isn't anyone who
can move back and forth as well as he did.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The term ``choral conductor,'' in fact, always seemed too
limiting, almost pejorative, in Shaw's case, even when, as usual,
it was couched in superlatives. Although he might not have been the
most consistently inspired orchestral leader, he was the music
director of the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra for 21 fruitful years
until 1988, no mean feat, although it is all but obliterated by the
shadow of his towering choral achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier on, you wouldn't even have called choral directors
conductors,'' Keene said. ``They were chorus masters. Shaw changed
all that, along with Hillis and Wagner.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation the finest choral conductors typically face, with
a large amateur chorus in combination with a professional
orchestra, is highly complex. Yet partly because of that very
involvement with amateur musicians, choral conductors tend to get
little respect, even _ or especially _ from the orchestral
colleagues with whom they often collaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Wondering What Will Happen Next
</P>
<P>
   True, certain symphonic and operatic maestros take a lively
interest in choral music. Conlon has directed the renowned
Cincinnati May Festival for two decades, and Masur retains ties to
a rich German choral tradition. But there are few others.
</P>
<P>
   And although many skilled chorus masters have followed in Shaw's
wake, relatively few genuine conductors of great promise,
demonstrated versatility or proven distinction have done so. The
entire field has to some extent been raised, this side of the
continental divide, but at the same time it may have leveled out.
</P>
<P>
   It has also grown more fragmented and diverse. ``World music is
coming into choral music rapidly,'' said Maclary of Bowling Green
University. Similarly, Keene cites the influence of the early-music
movement, and the proliferation of finely honed professional choirs
of small, almost chamber, scale. ``A whole other level of nuance
and color has come into choral music that has nothing to do with
training a big group of amateurs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such novel niches, with their varying goals and expectations,
are judged by different yardsticks, making it increasingly unlikely
that a single Shaw-like figure could come to tower over the field
again.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, the times have changed in other ways, with similar
fragmentations affecting other areas of the musical culture.
``Recordings are what pushed Robert into prominence, just as they
did Roger Wagner,'' Flummerfelt said of Shaw, who won the last of
his many Grammy awards posthumously, in February. ``The present
economic situation wouldn't allow something like that to happen
again.''
</P>
<P>
   So leaving aside the question of whether any Shaw-like figure
looms, larger than life, in the wings, would there even be a place
in this altered landscape for such a figure?
</P>
<P>
   At least one choral professional with a long view suggests that
there still is such a place, and that worthy candidates to occupy
it are indeed at hand, if not widely active on the American scene.
</P>
<P>
   Weston Noble, a friend of Shaw who, at 76, teaches at Luther
College in Decorah, Iowa, proposes three such figures: David
Willcocks, an English conductor who made his fame with the King's
College Choir, Cambridge; Helmuth Rilling, the German conductor of
the Gaechinger Kantorei and artistic director of the Oregon Bach
Festival, and John Nelson, an American who was the music director
of the Indianapolis Symphony from 1976 to 1987 and is now active
chiefly in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly these are all bona fide conductors as well as gifted
chorus masters with excellent credentials. Yet it remains to be
seen whether any of them is eager to carve out a bigger presence in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, much of Shaw's charm in the United States was his
down-home American-ness, his ability to connect with the populist
strain that runs deep in the nation's psyche and, for that matter,
deep in the roots of choral singing as he perceived it.
</P>
<P>
   He was not, like so much of the musical culture, transplanted
from Europe, but sprang, a rugged individualist, from American
soil. It is tempting to think that if anything like another Shaw is
to arise, it will do the same.
</P>
<P>
   In the final variation, Bruffy may have it right: ``We all kind
of went along on his coattails. Now his absence places a new
perspective and responsibility on us all.''

 &HT;    Real estate gems going once, going twice...on auction block
 &HT;    By Susan Harte
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ During the 1990s, as affluence has swept the country,
the number of ``trophy houses'' changing hands has soared, and the
auction gala _ a black-tie affair that auctioneers liken to an
elaborate wedding reception _ has become a more commonplace method
to sell them.
</P>
<P>
   Although a multi-million-dollar house is a challenge to build,
it can be even more of a challenge to sell. While the original
owner may regard all those gold bathroom fixtures and Italianate
marble fountains as the height of good taste, subsequent buyers may
recoil from them. In other instances, the upkeep on a stately
mansion can strike people as too troublesome. Sometimes, insolvent
owners send the houses into foreclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the motivation, more and more owners have been calling
auction companies, prompting industrywide sales to reach $40
billion last year, according to 84-year-old J. P. King Auction Co.
of Gadsden, Ala., one of the leading American real estate auction
houses.
</P>
<P>
   This evening, three Atlanta residences _ including a showy
palace known as Lionheart _ will go on the block by National
Auction Group, also of Gadsden. All are foreclosures by Bankers
Trust of California being sold at absolute auction.
</P>
<P>
   They could bring millions, or they could bring next to nothing.
It depends on whether the auction is ``reserve,'' in which case the
owner can refuse to accept a high bid, or ``absolute,'' in which
case the owner is obligated to sell to the high bidder.
</P>
<P>
   The sometimes unique nature of these houses means there are no
standard measures of value such as comparables. Their owners range
from people like cosmetics queen Mary Kay Ash and former Treasury
Secretary Lloyd Bentsen to those with murky sources of income.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, Lionheart and a property on Wildercliff Drive were
formerly owned by a Pakistani father and son, Mohammad Sharif and
Mohammad Javaid. In 1995, the pair came under legal scrutiny for
allegedly buying houses, selling them to themselves at much higher
prices and using the higher valuations to raise cash. Lionheart,
for instance, was bought by a Sharif company four years ago for
$5.5 million and sold the same day to Sharif for $12 million. He
took out a $5 million mortgage and a $2 million line of credit
using the house as collateral.
</P>
<P>
   None of the people associated with the transactions could be
reached for comment Monday. The third foreclosure is a big house on
Spalding Drive. It was formerly owned by a man who built swimming
pools.
</P>
<P>
   Whether banks have foreclosed on the houses that go to auction,
or whether they go to market for another reason, ``there is usually
no emotional attachment,'' said William Bone, president of National
Auction Group. ``These people (owners) . . . are risk-takers who
want to move the place, and move it fast.''
</P>
<P>
   He expects his company will sell 60 properties, or $7.2 billion
worth of residential real estate, this year. At an average 6
percent commission, he could see millions in profits.
</P>
<P>
   It has also meant increased competition. As the auction has
become a preferred selling tool _ and an excuse for a fancy party _
even some Atlanta-based MBAs have sought to taste the hors
d'oeuvres. Tom Hunter and John Johnson of Interstate Auction Co.
have joined with Jeb Howell III of Auction Management Corp. to form
Interstate Auction Management.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the property is a funeral home or former Atlanta Braves
outfielder Mike Devereaux's 3 1/2 story house at the Golf Club of
Georgia, it can often find a buyer at auction.
</P>
<P>
   Here is how Craig King, second-generation president of J.P. King
Auction, described the process.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of a $5 million house decides to move on. He is not
looking for the record price in the neighborhood _ just, King said,
``a fair price.'' A foreclosing lender, on the other hand, wants
its money back.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the houses are sold furnished.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want it to be in a good area, well cared for, and not
overly improved ,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   When an auction deal is signed, the seller pays the auction
house expenses, including marketing. The sales commission is an
additional 5 to 7 percent. On top of that, the buyer has to pay a 6
percent premium, above the bid amount, to cover closing costs and
other fees.
</P>
<P>
   The terms are strictly cash or short-term financing. It costs
$50 to get in to tonight's absolute auction. Potential bidders will
bring at least $100,000, cash or check, to participate. Should the
winning bid be accepted, the high bidder has until noon Wednesday
to pay the rest of the money. He or she never has longer than 30
days.
</P>
<P>
   Devereaux's house, incidentally, did not sell at its reserve
auction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was obviously disappointed,'' Devereaux said. ``Despite
heavy promotion, we did not attract bidders willing to pay what I
thought the house was worth.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he added, he hopes one of the 50 people who walked
through his house will come back with an offer.
</P>
<P>
   Often, said Craig King, they do.

<P>
   The warning signs are here _ a short, almost nonexistent winter,
an early, warm spring, less rainfall than normal _ all indicators
pointing to a meltdown summer.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are all these new books: ``The Garden Room:
Bringing Nature Indoors'' by Timothy Mawson (Clarkson Potter, $24),
``Garden Style'' (Better Homes and Garden Books, $34.95) and
``Gardenhouse: Bringing the Outdoors In'' by Bonnie Trust Dahan
(Chronicle Books, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   They too must be a sign that this summer will be a time of
legend, a season to hide from the heat, to retreat from the sun.
</P>
<P>
   To enjoy nature, we must move it in from the outside.
</P>
<P>
   We must consider the ``indoor world as an extension of the
natural world, not cut off from the realms of soil, sun and growing
plants,'' writes Mawson. He enthuses about rooms created ``with the
glow of the garden about them'' for entertaining, dining, relaxing.
</P>
<P>
   This is the emphasis of interiorscaping _ imbuing the formality
of public rooms with the sensual earthiness of the garden.
</P>
<P>
   In her book, Dahan includes photos of settings with similar
sympathies. A porch swing hangs inside a small house in lieu of a
sofa. Behind it, an outdoor awning covers a window like a curtain.
It's ``a private spot for bridging the sometimes conflicting
intentions of resting inside and getting out to the garden.''
</P>
<P>
   Dahan has found extreme cases of dragging the great outdoors
inside. She shows a kitchen that is home to a potting bench, now
used as a potholder, and a refrigerator that is sheathed in old
fence wood. On the freezer door is a small flower box that holds
drying hydrangeas. Branches of fresh lemons are entwined through
the chandelier. A rust-flecked outdoor chair wedged between the
fridge and the potting bench provides a space for company and
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to tear down the privacy fence and use the wood
to face the refrigerator. The editors of ``Garden Style'' show
rooms that seem overloaded with posies, yet most of them are of the
printed sort. A floral rug and floral-print throw pillows go a long
way to enliven a room.
</P>
<P>
   In another instance, floral-print curtains with a gingham check
border are held aloft by multiple twigs bound together to form a
curtain rod. In the same room, a lampshade is covered with green
silk leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, just the organic shape of a tree branch or a few
fallen rose petals is enough to soften a formal interior.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to bring a little nature into the nest is with
plants. In the years since macrame plant hangers were popular,
house plants have taken on a new identity.
</P>
<P>
   The practice of interiorscaping involves hauling soil and plants
inside. Becky Blackmon, interiorscape supervisor for Fort Worth's
Worthington hotel, is an expert at this, recently bagging her
second ``Best Project Award'' from Interiorscape magazine. The
lovely jungles of plants she creates in the hotel's lobby were her
entry. Considering the low-light ambience, it's a wonder she gets
anything to live. (She admits that many of the plants have to be
replaced.) The dark, severely air-conditioned lobby, which is so
soothing to newly arrived travelers, is not the best atmosphere for
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Blackmon, a Master Certified Nursery Professional, says that
most garden centers have people with similar qualifications who can
assess your houseplant needs. To be a successful houseplant person,
you need to critically assess the room, the availability of light,
and the amount of time you are willing to spend fussing over your
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Most people ``underestimate how much light plants need,'' says
Blackmon. Moving a plant just 3 feet can diminish available light
by 20 percent to 50 percent; a distance of 6 feet can reduce it up
to 90 percent. ``Light, temperature and humidity will play the
largest role in overall success of maintaining healthy plants,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   The best combinations for indoor-outdoor design combine such
varied elements as tropical plants, topiaries, flowering plants,
eclectic furniture, architectural elements and garden ornaments. A
final chapter in ``Garden Style'' includes the most helpful of all
information _ the stores that provide the key elements for
interiorscapes.
</P>
<P>
   Salvage One Architectural Artifacts in Chicago looks like a
great source for giant, statement-making, wrought-iron fencing and
finials. Kay O'Toole's place in Houston, Antiques and
Eccentricities, is mentioned, as is Ryan Gainey's place in Atlanta,
Ryan Gainey &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   The editors must have overlooked local shops Into the Garden in
University Village and House to Garden on Vickery. Both are
excellent sources for interiorscape materials such as plants,
garden ornaments and furniture.
</P>
<P>
   With all these references, lists, sources and advice, summer, it
seems, can be an enjoyable season _ spent indoors surrounded by the
garden.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   How to buy houseplants
</P>
<P>
   Advice from Becky Blackmon, interiorscape supervisor for The
Worthington hotel in Fort Worth:
</P>
<P>
   _Avoid plants with brown or yellow spots or with thin,leggy
shoots.
</P>
<P>
   _Blooming plants should be just at the cracked color stage (not
fully open).
</P>
<P>
   _Inspect for insects: undersides of leaves, ends of shoots.
</P>
<P>
   _Look for name and care tags.
</P>
<P>
   _Shop where there are certified nursery professionals so you can
get reliable answers to your questions.
</P>
<P>
   _Flowering plants generally need high light, whereas
large-leafed ones can tolerate lower light levels. Thick leaves
generally require less frequent waterings, whereas soft, fleshy
plants usually need more frequent watering.
</P>
<P>
   IMPORTANT: No matter what the water frequency demands, always
supply enough water to saturate the root ball.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Best-bet houseplants
</P>
<P>
   Becky Blackmon, interiorscape supervisor for The Worthington
hotel, lists these choice indoor plants:
</P>
<P>
   Kentia palms: large, and pricey, but worth it if you have the
room.
</P>
<P>
   Sansevieria: Very easy and reliable.
</P>
<P>
   Pothos ivy: old standby, and easy to grow from cuttings.
</P>
<P>
   Aglaonemas: Very pretty and easy if you don't overwater.
</P>
<P>
   Spathiphyllums: Large assortment of varieties, from table size
to floor size.
</P>
<P>
   Nephthytis, White Butterfly: Great for table centerpieces.
</P>
<P>
   Balfour aralia: Elegant floor plant, deep green.
</P>
<P>
   Aspidistra: Very low-light tolerant, large, deep green leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Dracaenas, Janet Craig, Massangeana, Warneckei: Low light, easy.
</P>
<P>
   African violets: Don't let them scare you; they really are easy.
Self-watering containers take the guesswork out of watering and
fertilizing.

JOKING COMPANY E-MAILS NO LAUGHING MATTER

By KEN LLOYD  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Q. I sent a harmless joke on our company e-mail to
some of the people who work with me, and several responded by
saying how much they liked it. My supervisor's reaction was the
exact opposite. She called me in and wrote up a formal reprimand,
and then she said that this is a final warning. This sounds unfair
to me. What do you think? D.W.
</P>
<P>
   A. Did you hear the one about the company that got sued because
employees were sending so-called jokes through the e-mail? The
less-than-funny fact is that using the company's e-mail for jokes
is not a joking matter. You were lucky, as many companies today
will terminate an employee for misusing the company's e-mail
system.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is what is funny to one person may be offensive to
another, and if that seemingly offensive material travels through a
company's e-mail, then the offended person may move into a
litigious mode and target the company itself. No matter what the
outcome may be, the whole process can be very costly.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the fact that you were unaware of your
company's policy in this area indicates that your employer needs to
take additional steps to publicize it. This is a point you should
mention to your manager.
</P>
<P>
   The entire area of humor at work is growing, with more companies
placing increased emphasis on the lighter side of work. This has
opened the door to a friendlier and more upbeat work atmosphere in
many organizations. At the same time, it is important to note that
jokes traveling through the company's e-mail system can have costly
punch lines. &QL; 
Q. I applied for a job in a company and heard nothing for three
months. I called once and got tossed around on their voice-mail
system, but never talked to anyone. I just received a rejection
letter, an ice-cold form letter that has several typos. Even my
name is spelled wrong. I'm annoyed and I'd like to write them back,
but I'm wondering if it's worth it. C.L.
</P>
<P>
   A. This company is not worth another second of your time. After
all, you took the time to apply for a job, only to be ignored for
three months. When the company finally let you know that your
services are not desired, they sent you a sample from the slipshod
handbook.
</P>
<P>
   You are probably very fortunate. If the way your application was
handled is any indicator of the way that this company deals with
people in general, this is an organization with little insight into
the importance of treating people with respect and trust.
</P>
<P>
   The company also appears to have minimal understanding of the
meaning of goodwill and the importance of maintaining a positive
image with the public. Presumably you are not the only person who
received this third-rate treatment, and, as more and more people in
the work force talk about the negative way that the company treated
them, there can be any number of costs.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that although you were an applicant, you are
possibly a customer, and definitely a link to other customers.
Since this company does not care about maintaining anything close
to goodwill with you, the best step is to take your business
elsewhere. &QL; 
Q. We just had a management meeting to discuss employee motivation,
and one of the managers said that Tuesday is the most productive
day of the week. Have you ever heard of this, and is there any
truth to it? K.S.
</P>
<P>
   A. There is no real management theory that conclusively proves
that if this is Tuesday, people must be productive. There are
studies that come up with interesting anecdotal research on the
so-called most productive days of the week, and, in fact, a recent
one did indicate that Tuesday is such a day.
</P>
<P>
   However, these types of studies tend to be quite
impressionistic, and they are often based on asking executives what
they think is the most productive weekday. Although a good number
of executives may believe that Tuesday is the best day for
motivation, that does not mean that Tuesday actually is the day of
highest motivation.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, these little studies find almost every weekday being
the highest productivity day at some point or another, with the
possible exception of Monday and Friday. However, rather than
worrying about which day may or may not be linked to increased
motivation, it makes more sense to focus on the employees as
individuals every day and try to create an environment in which
meeting their needs is linked to the attainment of organizational
goals. In this way, there is an increased likelihood that none of
the weekdays will be weak days.

 &HT;    Courage in Cabbagetown
 &HT;    By Jay Bookman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It must be solitary work _ sitting in a crane all day
hundreds of feet above a construction site, your only contact with
your fellow man coming from disembodied voices carried into your
cab by radio. But that day-to-day routine could not have prepared
Ivers Simms for what happened to him Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Because for many long minutes yesterday, Simms looked more alone
than any man alive.
</P>
<P>
   A massive fire had broken out at one of the buildings in the
19th-century Fulton Bag and Cotton Mill, where Simms was running a
construction crane. The other workers had fled, but Simms could not
escape his 250-foot tower. Below him, a blood-red inferno belched
black, poisonous smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to escape the heat and the smoke, Simms scrambled as far
from the fire as possible, until he ran out of crane and could go
no farther. Hundreds of people watched helplessly from the ground
below; many thousands more watched in horror on television. The
flames would die down briefly, then erupt skyward as if trying to
snatch Simms from his lonely perch.
</P>
<P>
   And below, the fire was blackening the white steel crane.
</P>
<P>
   Already, however, hundreds of people were scrambling to help. A
small police helicopter flew close enough to offer him the only aid
it could give at the moment, which was reassurance that he had not
been abandoned. A larger helicopter from the state Department of
Natural Resources arrived at the scene prepared for a rescue
attempt. Its pilot, a DNR veteran, was Boyd Clines, and he was
assisted by Larry Rogers. Matt Mosely, a firefighter from the city
of Atlanta, volunteered to dangle from the chopper in a rope
harness, land on the crane and then strap in the beleaguered Simms
for rescue.
</P>
<P>
   The heat and smoke were not the only dangers. A fire that hot
creates its own wind _ strong updrafts that can easily slap a
helicopter around. The DNR crew had prepared for work in forest
fires and for extracting hikers injured in narrow mountain gorges,
but this would be something new.
</P>
<P>
   And they pulled it off perfectly. What had seemed to be a
heart-rending tragedy in the making, with a human life almost
literally hanging in the balance, was transformed by the courage of
well-trained men and women willing to risk their lives for others.
</P>
<P>
   The fire will be a terrible setback for Cabbagetown, a
long-neglected part of Atlanta that had only recently begun a
revival. The cotton mill was on the National Register of Historic
Places, and the nine-building complex was in the midst of a
renovation into more than 500,000 square feet of loft apartments,
offices and other space.
</P>
<P>
   However, more than half of the renovation project has been
completed and is already occupied, and those buildings survived the
fire unscathed. The neighborhood itself _ a mix of urban pioneers
and hardy longtime residents _ is too tough to accept this setback.
For inspiration in their rebuilding, they need only look back at
Monday's events.
</P>
<P>
   Because as lonely as he looked out there on that crane, Ivers
Simms wasn't alone at all.

IT'S TIME TO MAKE THE COMMITMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARRY ROSENFELD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBNAY, N.Y. _ The fragility of the NATO coalition grows, it
seems, almost by the day as airplanes from the alliance bomb ever
more targets in Yugoslavia with perhaps marginal effect to bring
Slobodan Milosevic to heel.
</P>
<P>
   Second-guessing is rampant, especially in Washington, as early
hopes for a quick resolution disappeared and the Serbs proceeded to
implement their war aims despite escalating air attacks. The Serb
and Yugoslav forces apparently have registered great success in
decimating the Kosovo Liberation Army and in depopulating the
province of its ethnic Albanians, who comprised 90 percent of the
population of 1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   There is a naive, not to say child-like, quality to the falling
out among the generals and the diplomats, each accusing the other
of having forced this war. It comes only days after a retreat from
the war's inception, in backroom strategy sessions, even as a
confident posture was maintained in public.
</P>
<P>
   The collateral of military action, the inevitable civilian
casualties, are sharpening the critical arguments, leading to
mindless restrictions on what targets may be legitimately bombed.
Some oppose the destruction of bridges across the Danube, because
that affects not only the military infracstructure but also the
lives of ordinary people. Other critics are against bombing
television facilities, even though they play the essential role in
the Milosevic regime's control of the information Serbs are
permitted to obtain.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the horrors that attend this war, the stark truth is
that it is either going to be lost by NATO, which is to say by the
United States, or it is going to be won through staying the course.
What is required is ratcheting up the deployment of state of the
art weaponry that only a while ago was deemed gratuitous overkill.
Even the possible use of ground forces, once considered by the
allies the Rubicon that under no circumstances could be crossed, is
gaining credence.
</P>
<P>
   The justification for this intervention is not to elevate one
side or the other in the long-lived ethnic, religious and
nationalistic conflicts that have characterized this troubled land.
NATO has no special competence to untangle the rights and wrongs of
the various claims and counterclaims of victimhood.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one legitimate reason for unleashing the might of
the 19 nations of the NATO alliance against the rump of what once
was Yugoslavia: To halt the inhumane persecutions, killings and
expulsions which the Serbs are using to settle up with the ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   That drastic action was employed by Milosevic first to gain
power among the Serbs and then to maintain it. In the process, he
moved from stirring rhetoric to bloody action, shocking much of the
world. It is likely that what he has unleashed meets the definition
of genocide as spelled out in international law.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly his actions trigger remembrances of the slaughter of
millions in the Holocaust in the Second World War. While Serb
actions have not gone to the lengths of rounding up an entire
religious group for extermination in death camps, mass killings of
Muslims by Serbs have been documented in Kosovo, as they were
earlier in Bosnia (where NATO was reluctant to intervene until
after thousands had perished).
</P>
<P>
   The pictures of Kosovars, many women and children and old
people, being herded onto trains to be transported into exile
brought to mind how Germans shipped Jews to the death camps. The
world should not have stood idly by, giving the Serbs time and
space to impose new and perhaps more drastic persecutions.
</P>
<P>
   It is an historic irony that during the Second War, the Serbs
were fierce enemies of the Germans. Many of their foes today were
in the Nazi camp then. But that does not give them leave to deal
with their problems of national integrity, however gravely they
regard them, by these intolerable means.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best that can be said about this horror is that in
the end, the world, or much of it, did not forget, did not
rationalize doing nothing, but took up arms on behalf of a
humanitarian cause.
</P>
<P>
   Many critics of NATO point to all the places where similar
atrocities were committed but no action was taken.
</P>
<P>
   Philosophers and ethicist rightly view the world through the
moral logic enunciated by the metaphysician Immanuel Kant: ``Act as
if the maxim from which you act were to become through your will a
universal law.' Would that were possible in all worldy affairs
(indeed, in all personal ones). It is plain to see that it is not.
There are more times when, for a host of rationalizations, we do
not resort to action, such as the genocide in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   Remorse over that failure likely helped to energize the Kosovo
response. In the end, failing the test of Kant's categorical
imperative should not immobilize us from acting when we can sort
out our politics, consider the implications and the costs, and make
the commitment.

SILENT KILLER TARGETS POOR WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary

 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Estelle Lawton, a public health nurse supervisor,
is no longer surprised to hear 50-year-old women tell her they've
never done a breast self-examination.
</P>
<P>
   The stresses faced by the population Lawton serves help to
explain the trend:
</P>
<P>
   _ Women often are working, but in low-wage jobs that have
insufficient health-insurance coverage. They don't do self-exams
and may avoid screening for fear they'll find a costly health
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think if they don't know, they don't have a problem,''
Lawton says.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cultural taboos inhibit them from getting to know, much less
touch, their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy is that these obstacles prevent many poor women from
seeking medical help before it's too late. Disparate survival rates
among women who've been diagnosed with breast cancer demonstrate
their folly.
</P>
<P>
   While white women have an 84 percent survival rate after their
diagnosis, Hispanic and African-American women, who make up a
disproportionate share of the nation's poor, respectively have
rates of 70 percent and 69 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Lawton, who works with Adult Health Services of the San Antonio
Metropolitan Health District, says studies show Hispanic and
African-American women tend to be diagnosed after the cancer has
reached an advanced stage. Limited resources to offer preventive,
low-cost screening exacerbate the problem.
</P>
<P>
   That's where groups like the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer
Foundation come in. Events such as the ``Race for the Cure'' raise
money to fund research, prevention and treatment of breast cancer.
The Dallas-based organization then is able to fill in the
health-care gaps as it has in San Antonio by helping the
Metropolitan Health District expand the scope of its low-cost
breast-cancer screenings.
</P>
<P>
   Federal funding for the screenings performed under Adult Health
Services programs is limited to women 50 and older, the group most
at risk of developing breast cancer. Women over 65 are covered by
Medicare. Left out are women who are 40 to 50.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Herbert Brown, director of the district's Women's Health
Services, says grants from the Komen Foundation have helped fill
the gap.
</P>
<P>
   But key to preventing needless deaths to the silent killer
remains in education and prevention, a hurdle that Lawton believes
the medical community finally, if incrementally, is beginning to
overcome, even in the hard-to-reach low-income community.
</P>
<P>
   Media campaigns that target the group are making inroads, as are
federal programs such as ``Comadres,'' an initiative aimed at
educating women over 65 who are on Medicare about the availability
of low-cost mammograms.
</P>
<P>
   Lawton points out, too, that breast cancer diagnosis no longer
means certain disfigurement by mastectomy, a prospect that long has
scared many women away from screenings.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Lawton says the single most motivating factor
that prompts women to perform self-examinations is that knowing
someone who's had breast cancer or who has found a lump in her
breast.
</P>
<P>
   There are greater motivators. The American Cancer Society
reports that 175,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer
this year; more than 43,000 will die. The Komen Foundation points
to research showing that the mortality rate could decrease by 30
percent if all women age 50 and older in need of a mammogram had
one.
</P>
<P>
   What more motivation do women need?

EXPERTS DISAGREE ON VALUE OF F-117 WRECKAGE IN COPYING STEALTH
TECHNOLOGY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL D. TOWLE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Just after the downing of an F-117 stealth fighter
over Yugoslavia on March 27, Pentagon officials played down
suggestions that Russia might be able to catch up on stealth
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Now, more than two weeks after the plane went down, the verdict
is mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Some leading aerospace experts say the wreckage of the
radar-evading fighter could help Russian scientists learn how the
F-117 Nighthawk is produced and how radar systems can track it.
Others say the technology is too dated to do the Russians much
good.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they gain from this is an actual example of the materials
that go into the airplane, its wings and its components,'' said Tim
Lomparis, a weapons technology expert at St. Louis University in
St. Louis. ``There is a big advantage to being able to look and see
what the plane is made of and not just having to speculate about
what it is believed to be made of.''
</P>
<P>
   Lomparis said that Russian scientists _ who are expected to gain
access to the wreckage _ will probably try to recreate the material
that makes up the plane's skin. Once a closely guarded military
secret, this composite, nonmetallic substance makes the aircraft
almost invisible to radar.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can bounce radar blips off it to see exactly how stealth
materials actually diffuse and scatter radar beams,'' Lomparis
said. ``They would still have to develop radar technology to be
able to overcome the problem, but they could see exactly what the
problem is. That plane's wreckage could help them a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force has declined to make any detailed comment on the
downing of the F-117, whose pilot bailed out and was rescued. The
service has yet to say officially whether the plane was shot down.
Pentagon officials say that the matter is under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the mishap, Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said:
``To the extent that other countries have not been able to
duplicate our ability in stealth, there obviously is some risk.''
But he added that the Lockheed Martin plane, developed in the late
1970s in a top-secret project, is too old to provide meaningful
information on current stealth technology.
</P>
<P>
   Many at the Pentagon say privately that they hope Bacon is
right. The United States has invested billions developing stealth
aircraft, including the F-117, the B-2 bomber and the F-22
air-superiority fighter. If the Russians were to develop a radar
system that could track stealth aircraft, they could dramatically
improve their air defenses and earn billions in the international
arms market.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Interfax news agency has reported that the Yugoslav
government already has turned over some of the wreckage to the
Russians. The Yugoslavs reportedly want to exchange the rest of the
wreckage for Russian-made surface-to-air missiles. Aerospace Daily,
an industry trade journal, said one engine of the F-117 is believed
to have survived the crash with little damage.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Brown, a retired Lockheed executive and former program
manager and chief engineer for the F-117A, said the ``basic
principles of stealth'' are well known in the aviation community.
But he acknowledged that Russian scientists might learn additional
details from the downed plane's wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may know in general how the materials are done, but they
may see something they did not know,'' Brown said. ``Designers do
that all the time. You may see something on another plane that you
believe may be incorporated into what you are doing. I doubt it
would be a breakthrough for them. It would probably be a secondary
design idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the key to a stealth plane's design is enclosing the
parts most visible to radar within the radar-evading material.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can calculate what kind of a signature you will get from
the basic plane,'' Brown said, ``and then the rest of the game is
making sure all the details are inside the tent _ things like
controls, exhaust nozzles and inlets.''
</P>
<P>
   Some aerospace experts said they believe that the Russians will
be wasting their time if they ``reverse engineer'' the downed
F-117.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Sweetman, author of ``Stealth Bomber,'' a 1989 book on the
B-2 and other stealth programs, said the wreckage would reveal
little that is not already known.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the materials, technology and design for the B-2
and F-22 are significantly different from that of the F-117 and
that the Russians could learn nothing from the Nighthawk to help
counter the two later aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the bits and pieces that went into the F-117 were
particularly exotic,'' Sweetman said. ``The goal was to get a
stealth aircraft into service very quickly. A lot of the materials
used were derived from commercial products on the open market.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Aboulafia, a defense and aerospace expert with the Teal
Group in Fairfax, Va., said the Russians have little interest in
developing a stealth aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the Russians taking the opportunity to poke Uncle
Sam in the eye,'' Aboulafia said.

   GRDELICA, Yugoslavia _ No one knew the names of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   They were not locals, just strangers passing through on the
Belgrade to Skopje train, No. 393, at about 11:45 Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   They were unlucky, it seems, to be in this particularly
spectacular gorge, on this particular bridge, in this particular
train, at this particular time, when death dropped down unseen from
a cloudy sky.
</P>
<P>
   In its expanding air war, NATO planes Monday morning bombed two
bridges _ one highway, one railway _ over the Juzna Morava River.
The train, five cars pulled by a bright red, white and blue engine,
was on the railway bridge, a narrow structure of steel girders
painted a dull gray. The missile cut the train in half.
</P>
<P>
   At least nine people were killed, said police at the scene, and
at least 16 others, badly wounded, were brought to a hospital in
nearby Leskovac. At least two planes were heard, according to a
police sergeant who would not give his name, but they could not be
seen above the clouds. He said that the bridge was hit and then the
train itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now go away,'' he said through a translator. ``I don't want to
hear English anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said in Brussels Monday that the alliance had
targeted the bridges here, some 190 miles south of Belgrade, on
what it considers an important supply route into Kosovo. But the
deaths they put down to another accident of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no intent to hit the train,'' said NATO spokesman
Jamie P. Shea. ``Regrettably, we cannot exclude the possibility of
casualties in this instance.''
</P>
<P>
   The casualties were not hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   Three railway cars were incinerated, still hot and smoking three
hours later, when the first journalists arrived.
</P>
<P>
   On the grassy verge next to the tracks, close to a small plowed
field turning green and a street of damaged houses, nine charred
and broken corpses lay heaped by a small tree. Their clothes had
been blown or burned away.
</P>
<P>
   Police and army officers had begun to arrive in groups to direct
traffic, get the earthmovers working on a makeshift detour around
the holed highway bridge and to keep the curious away.
</P>
<P>
   Three men wearing transparent plastic gloves walked up to the
grassy verge with a cheap coffin, pale knotty wood on the inside,
the outside stained a not very convincing darker brown.
</P>
<P>
   One man, in blue overalls, picked up a female torso, from the
neck to the buttocks, and placed it into the coffin. He then bent
down and lightly tossed a blackened arm into the coffin, picking up
his head to stare at the smoldering cars, the rushing river below
and the steep hills, dotted with spring greenery and flowering
fruit trees.
</P>
<P>
   The smell of spring was strong, lush and damp, quickly overtaken
by that of burning oil, rubber and electrical wire. Then, like the
top note of a perfume, the melancholy, sweet, cloying smell of
burned human flesh.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our life now _ spring and death,'' said Nenad Pezo, the
Yugoslav Army minder who had allowed a car of journalists to make a
detour and come here.
</P>
<P>
   A man watching from the narrow road at first refused to talk.
Then he began to throw words like stones. ``Another atrocity,'' he
said. ``Or do the NATO criminals think atrocities are not
atrocities from the air?'' Asked his name, he spit on the ground.
Goran, he said, then turned away.
</P>
<P>
   The journalists had come from the scene of another NATO
accident, in the little Kosovo village of Merdare, near Mirovace,
about 1.5 miles northwest of Podujevo, near the provincial border
with Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   This is Kosovo, but no official here would discuss the military
situation. Any brief discussion of the condition of the ethnic
Albanians here or the tactics of the Serbian military toward them
was either bland or tendentious.
</P>
<P>
   On the road south there were numerous checkpoints, guards on
bridges and a heavy troop presence on a cloudy day, both on foot
and in trucks. But there was little armor visible. Sometimes one
could hear planes, but not see them.
</P>
<P>
   Deeper in Kosovo, where journalists are not allowed to wander,
there are continuing, consistent reports of Serb atrocities against
ethnic Albanian supporters of the Kosovo Liberation Army. But we
were brought here by the Yugoslav authorities to witness Serb
suffering.
</P>
<P>
   In Merdare, NATO bombs and anti-personnel bombs demolished four
houses in the early hours of Sunday morning, killing five people,
including Bozina Tosovic, 30 years old, and his 11-month-old
daughter, Bojana. His wife, Marija, six months pregnant, is in the
hospital, along with the four members of the Markovic family:
Dragan and his wife Natalija and their two children, daughter
Andelija and son Milos.
</P>
<P>
   Markovic's brother, Ljubomir, 42, had just arrived an hour
before from Belgrade, where he lives, and walked in shock around
the blasted houses and stables. He had heard about the attack on
television, and then the local police phoned him.
</P>
<P>
   In the collapsed remains of his brother's house, of mud brick
and wood, with what had been a red tile roof, he found the family
dog, Snoopy, a yellow mongrel, with half his snout blown away.
</P>
<P>
   Ljubomir began to sob, kneeling by the quivering dog, petting
his head, as sunlight poured through a huge hole in the roof. ``Are
you scared my doll?'' he asked. ``Are you scared, sweetheart?''
</P>
<P>
   He looked up, tears streaming. ``Should I shoot him? I can't.''
He then stood to gather some family photos blown through the rubble
of the children's bedroom, the mud and wood roof and exterior wall
collapsed on their beds. ``Can you imagine passing through this?''
he asked. A broken mirror had a row of stamps pasted on it
featuring soccer stars, sponsored by Sony.
</P>
<P>
   He turned back to the dog, then said: ``Ten years. For 10 years
it was impossible to find two socks and two shoes together because
of that Snoopy.''

 GRDELICA: that Snoopy.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the fields, there were hundreds of small holes in the earth
from detonations, and small green nylon parachutes from what
appeared to be NATO anti-personnel bombs, covering an area of about
300 square yards. Large pieces of green painted metal, with yellow
stripes, perfectly broken open as if on a seam, lay about the yard.
There were also large pieces of formed yellow styrofoam and light
aluminium containers, with fans like whirligigs, that appeared to
have held the small parachutes, with explosives attached.
</P>
<P>
   There was one dead pig and another wounded, and shrapnel
everywhere. Trees were broken off and flung 20 yards. A child's
pillow with cartoon characters, mice and cats, lay in the mud.
</P>
<P>
   Markovic pulled at an elbow. ``The cow is dead but the calf is
alive, but he's wounded,'' he said, staring. ``Should I shoot the
calf?''
</P>
<P>
   In the ruined stable, a massive black and white cow lay dead
across the door. Markovic stepped on it to reach the brown calf,
its tail nearly severed and its breath labored. ``It won't move
from its mother,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He came out and appealed to a policeman, who talked softly to
him but only shrugged. ``I don't believe there is any comment on
this,'' Markovic said. ``I care more about this cow and calf and
dog than Clinton and Albright care about anyone in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Miloje Smiljkovic, described as a local detective, in plain
clothes and two days' growth of beard, pointed out the sights.
``There is no military objective here that anyone can think of,''
he said. ``Maybe they're trying to cut off Kosovo from Serbia.''
The attacks came just after midnight on Orthodox Easter Sunday, and
again at 2 a.m. and 4:25 a.m., he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also possible that the planes were going after
Yugoslav army troops or a column of vehicles on the nearby road,
which might explain the use of the anti-personnel munitions.
</P>
<P>
   Dragan Bubalo was another of the dead, killed in his Ford
Sierra, which was blasted off the paved road. The dark blue car,
shot through with holes from shrapnel and its hood blown 60 yards
away, had run into an earth embankment. The metal road sign marking
the village of Merdare was also full of shrapnel holes.
</P>
<P>
   On a second hill, three large craters, about 10 yards deep, had
destroyed the house, barn, car and tractor of Milutin Veskovic, an
actor at a local theater called Zajecar, who was not home when the
bombs hit. The plastic tray of a box of chocolates landed 150 yards
away. Socks hung weirdly from the branches of the broken trees.
</P>
<P>
   His neighbor, Ognjen Bercovic, came along, an old man leaning on
a stick. ``We heard the planes, then the bombs,'' he said. ``There
was a huge light, a flash.'' Asked how his family is, he began to
cry. ``The kids are so terrified,'' he said, describing his
grandson, 2 years old, and his 15-day-old grandaughter, Marina.
``They're still shaking,'' he said, then attacked the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their bombs will not scare us,'' he shouted, still weeping.
``No man will frighten us.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Tosovic house, neighbors and some soldiers were trying to
salvage what they could: a ripped couch, a television set, plates
and glasses. A thin man, a neighbor, was asked about the family. He
became incensed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't talk to Americans or Brits,'' he said tightly. ``I
won't talk to them. I don't want to look at them. I'm sorry,'' he
said, ``but please just go away.''

USUAL OPTIMISM RULES AT FENWAY OPENER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Citizens of Red Sox Nation are a resilient lot.
Rightfully cynical in August and September, they are wild optimists
in April. In this spirit, the Red Sox will return to an
enthusiastic, overflow crowd at Olde Fenway for the 99th home
opener of Boston's American League franchise.
</P>
<P>
   In the Hardball Hub of the Universe, Opening Day beats First
Night every year. Kind professors cancel class, cool parents write
excuse notes, and shopkeepers lock their stores and hang ``gone
fishin' '' signs on the door. This is the day when high-roller,
front-running ``fans'' (like those Catholics who attend Mass only
on Christmas and Easter) get cold and leave early, and blow-dried
news anchors refer to manager Jimy Williams as ``coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Happily (some would say surprisingly), there is hope for the
local nine. A week of good games (five wins and one loss) against
the much-buffeted Kansas City Royals and Tampa Bay Devil Rays has
erased some of the doubt and anger of the Red Sox' horrid
offseason.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that the schedule-maker was a friend to the Red
Sox. Had the team opened at home, free agent acquisition Jose
Offerman would have gotten the Antoine Walker treatment, general
manager Dan Duquette would have needed a Groucho mask (to go with
those natty white sneakers), and fans might have boycotted
concession items in a show of solidarity for the working-class
heroes in the pushcarts around Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   But all of that negativity was erased by a 5-1 start that
featured the pitching, speed, and defense the Sox promised, and a
heroic introduction for the much-maligned Mr. Offerman (six
multihit games and a .483 average).
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox were the last major league team to taste defeat in
1999 and are off to their best start since the 1946 World Series
edition. When Bret Saberhagen toes the rubber just after 1 Tuesday,
Boston will be in a first-place tie with the vaunted and hated
world champion New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see the electricity,'' malaprop manager Williams said
when he arrived at Fenway Monday morning. Three hours before his
one-year contract extension was announced, Williams greeted veteran
groundskeeper Joe Mooney and accepted kind questions from the
``surprised'' Boston media.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we played well in the first week,'' said Williams.
``The kids were focused when they went about their work in the
spring and I think it carried over into the season. We've gotten
good pitching and we've caught the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox have not played at Fenway since Oct. 3, when their
92-win season fizzled in a playoff loss to the Cleveland Indians. A
cruel winter followed, lowlighted by the defection of Mo Vaughn to
the Anaheim Angels and Duquette's difficulty at getting a big-name
free agent slugger to come to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the hideous offseason, this first week of the
season couldn't have worked out better for Duquette: The Sox are on
fire and Mo is on crutches. Meanwhile, Offerman has been the second
coming of Willie Wilson and Boston's pitching simply smothered the
woeful Royals and Rays.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Rice will throw out a first ball and Fenway fans should be
prepared for new signage in and around the old yard. Like
everything else (except the Masters), baseball is on the way to
becoming Winston Cup racing; we are only a few years away from John
Valentin wearing a Valvoline patch on his sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 home opener set the tone for Boston's wild card season.
The Sox trailed, 7-2, in the ninth inning, but rallied for seven
runs without making an out against the beleaguered Seattle bullpen.
Vaughn's walkoff homer launched a successful season and the Sox see
no reason why they can't do it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think our fans are looking forward to opening up and
watching these kids play,'' said Williams. ``I'm looking forward to
it. It's Boston and it's Opening Day.''
</P>
<P>
   A raft of brittle pitchers, a dearth of power, and the mighty
wallets of the Yankees may yet dissolve some of this early-season
exuberance, but not today. Your mailman and your butcher are
talking baseball again.
</P>
<P>
   It's Opening Day and the Red Sox are in first place.
</P>
<P>
   This could be the year.

COACH DENIES CHARGE LEVELED BY FORMER PUPIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard Callaghan, one of the world's most distinguished figure
skating coaches, has strongly denied charges that he engaged in
sexual misconduct with a former pupil who later became his coaching
assistant.
</P>
<P>
   In a story in Sunday's New York Times, Craig Maurizi said that
Callaghan, who directed Tara Lipinski to an Olympic gold medal and
Todd Eldredge to a world title at the Detroit Skating Club, had
initiated a sexual elationship with him when Maurizi was 15.
Maurizi, now a 36-year-old husband and father, said the
relationship continued sporadically until two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Times also reported that two other male skaters said
Callaghan had made sexual overtures to them and that a former
coaching colleague said three male skaters told her that Callaghan
had made sexual advances to them or others. Callaghan said the
reports were untrue.
</P>
<P>
   The 53-year-old Callaghan, who is married with a grown daughter,
did not return a phone call Monday but ``fervently denied''
Maurizi's charges through his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Callaghan and his family are shocked and deeply dismayed
that Mr. Maurizi has made these unsubstantiated allegations,''
Michigan attorney Dean Groulx said in a statement. ``They have
always viewed Mr. Maurizi as an invaluable member of their extended
family and hope he will be able to resolve his emotional
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Maurizi, who was traveling Monday and did not return a phone
call, has said he will file a formal grievance against Callaghan
with the US Figure Skating Association. The USFSA's top officials
were also traveling Monday and unavailable for comment. But a
spokesman said the association, which was aware of Maurizi's
allegations before the Times story, would wait until receiving the
grievance before proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Maurizi, who trained with and coached alongside Callaghan for
more than two decades and asked him to be best man at his wedding,
has been seeing a therapist to deal with what he later concluded
was an exploitative relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, I thought the sex was consensual,'' Maurizi told
the Times. ``Now, when I look back, I don't think it was
consensual. I don't care how old a student is, whether it's a boy
or a girl, a coach should never have sex with a student.''
</P>
<P>
   Callaghan, who announced last month that he would leave the
Detroit Skating Club at the end of the spring and retire from
active coaching after 27 years, has the most accomplished record of
any American coach in the last quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
   Besides coaching Lipinski to her Olympic victory at Nagano last
year, Callaghan has directed Eldredge to five world medals and five
US titles and was Nicole Bobek's coach when she won the 1995 US
crown and world bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
   Eldredge said Monday he was ``shocked'' by Maurizi's charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never experienced anything like that with Richard, so I
don't know what he's talking about,'' said the 27-year-old
Eldredge, who grew up in Chatham, Mass. and has been coached by
Callaghan since he was 10. ``Richard has been like a father to me,
especially with me living away from home for so long. I've been
pretty much a part of the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Maurizi, who is leaving the Detroit club to become skating
director at the New England Sports Center in Marlborough, Mass. in
June, began training with Callaghan in Buffalo when he was 13 and
followed him to Philadelphia and Colorado Springs.
</P>
<P>
   He said Callaghan began a sexual relationship with him two years
later and that they had hundreds of intimate encounters in hotels,
in rink offices, and at Callaghan's house. Maurizi said he ``never
had the guts'' to break with his mentor until recently.
</P>
<P>
   Maurizi told the Detroit Free Press that he met with Callaghan
for five hours in February before he decided to speak publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I confronted him, I asked him point-blank why he did to
me what he did . . . and he said, `To tell you the truth, I felt
that it was something that you wanted to do. That's why I did it,'
'' Maurizi said. Callaghan has denied discussing the issue with
him.
</P>
<P>
   After Maurizi retired from competitive skating in 1987, he was
Callaghan's assistant for several years in San Diego and joined him
again four years ago in Detroit. The two parted ways last year
after Lipinski switched from Callaghan to Maurizi. Callaghan has
said professional rivalry is the motive behind Maurizi's charges.

<TEXT>
<P>
   There was no question that Bill Rue wanted the toy car, a
childhood object that set off memories of 1969, when the Mets won
the World Series and his parents bought their first color TV. But
it wasn't until he found himself bidding against an anonymous foe
in an Internet auction one evening that he knew he must have it.
</P>
<P>
   Rue, a Brooklyn realtor who has no regrets about paying $101 for
a used toy that opened at $9, is hardly alone in his embrace of the
online auction. It is an Internet phenomenon that in a matter of
months has captivated the nation's bargain hunters and spawned a
market for nostalgia. Millions of Americans are sweating silently
at their computers, bidding electronically on things they have
never seen, tendered by people they have never met.
</P>
<P>
   While retailers continue to spend furiously to draw more
customers on line, the Internet is suddenly teeming with buyers and
sellers making their own markets. Items range from a 50-gallon fish
tank (four goldfish included) to painted plaster hula girls to the
1987 Mercedes 300 turbo diesel that Bill Steinhour of northern
Virginia landed with a $5,800 bid.
</P>
<P>
   Economists say the blossoming of online bidding is no surprise.
Auctions are theoretically a very efficient form of commerce, the
perfect nexus of the supply-and-demand curves. But they have
traditionally been expensive to hold and limited in reach. The
Internet solves both of those problems: on line, bidders in Florida
and California can view the same Civil War-era glass perfume
bottle. They are also relieved of the social awkwardness and
time-consuming nature of haggling face to face. Many simply
automate their bidding, letting the computer take care of
negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   It is not all about market efficiency, however. Buyers and
sellers might find themselves exchanging e-mail about the former
teen-age idol Bobby Sherman, long after the transaction was over.
On Ebay, the most popular auction site, etiquette dictates that
buyers and sellers post feedback about each other as a guide to
others.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the adrenaline rush of winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get the fun of outbidding someone; you get something
glorious in the mail, and on top of that someone publicly praises
you for doing it,'' said Robrt Pela, 37, a writer in Phoenix, who
has acquired several Partridge Family albums via online auction in
recent weeks. ``It's become my favorite form of procrastination.''
</P>
<P>
   If Americans become hooked on cyberspace bargaining, the
implications for the retail economy could be as wide reaching as
the introduction of fixed pricing enabled by standardized
production a century ago. While 1998 online auction sales were a
relatively small $1.4 billion, some analysts see a future where
everything is a negotiation, from heating oil to the chopped meat
at the Internet grocery store. ``There is a building mind-set of,
`Hey, I can bid for things,''' said Kate Delhagen, a senior analyst
at Forrester Research. ``All this has the net effect that people
start thinking that they can name their price. This is going to
cause a real change in how we do business.''
</P>
<P>
   In a report released last week, Forrester predicted that
business-to-consumer interactions would account for 66 percent of a
$19 billion online auction market by 2003. Already, several sites
like Onsale and First Auction have created a hybrid format of
auction retailer. They buy excess merchandise cheaply, particularly
computer equipment, and resell it to the highest bidder. Tickets
for air travel are also widely up for bid through auction-like
vendors like Priceline.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, most Web transactions are person-to-person through
third-party auction houses that connect interested parties. And the
Web's central bazaar is Ebay, a San Jose, Calif., venture started
in 1995, whose audience has recently surged to 6.5 million visitors
a month and has a market capitalization of $23 billion (roughly
three times that of Kmart). Ebay keeps no inventory and takes no
responsibility for authenticity of the wares being showcased on its
screens. It does take a variable percentage of each final bid,
making it one of the few Internet ventures to be profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Ebay's hands-off formula has raised concerns about fraud. There
have been numerous instances where genuinely naive sellers have
misrepresented their wares _ advertising an 18th-century British
sea chest, for example, when they have a 19th-century traveling
trunk. Instances of outright theft, where buyers send off their
checks and never receive their booty, although far rarer, have also
occurred. While the company insists that 99.9 percent of the
transactions on its site go off without a complaint, the federal
government is investigating individual allegations of fraud. And
Ebay reached a settlement last month with the New York City
Department of Consumer Affairs in which it agreed to take steps to
weed out fraudulent sellers. The company also recently signed a
deal with Collector's Universe, an authentication service to which
sellers can pay a fee if they want their items evaluated and
vouched for.
</P>
<P>
   Still, consumers are voting with their modems, and as they
continue to click on Ebay, competitors are trying to cut in. Last
month, the online bookseller Amazon.com opened its own auction
house. Sotheby's and Christie's, the gold standard of traditional
practitioners, have said they will soon deign to peddle by modem.
And a plethora of niche sites like gunbroker.com, planet bike and
mobilia.com, for car buffs, are proliferating.

VOLUNTEERS TRAIN, MOVE OUT IN SUPPORT OF KLA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOLSCH, Albania _ Gunfire crackled in the hills of this village
Monday, as dozens of volunteers to the Kosovo Liberation Army
arrived for a brief training session before venturing north to the
border, where fighting intensified with Serb troops.
</P>
<P>
   The new soldiers, dressed in the red-speckled camouflage uniform
of the KLA, ran from field to field clutching Kalashnikov rifles
against their chests. In formation, they dropped to the ground,
aiming their weapons into the valley below.
</P>
<P>
   And although their open-air exercises appeared rudimentary _
with soldiers running back and forth across a two-lane highway,
twirling their rifes in the air _ several recent arrivals said they
are just days away from joining a convoy mission into southern
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Such missions appear to have increased in recent days, provoking
a sustained firefight at the Kosovo-Albanian border, which Albanian
officials fear may spill farther south to the country.
</P>
<P>
   Serb shelling has already begun to penetrate deep into the
region. Civilians in the northern town of Tropolje were killed on
Sunday. Two hundred rounds of mortar fire reportedly fell on Sunday
in the town of Padesh as well. And Monday, an outside monitor said
he witnessed a burning house in the town of Kamenica, just south of
the Kosovo border.
</P>
<P>
   ``The firefight is continuing and it is escalating,'' said Leo
Dobbs, a field monitor for the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, from a station in Bayram Curri. ``The Serbs
are firing mortar and more artillery into Albania. ... It is
getting worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Albanian officials responded by asking NATO for ground support,
saying the integrity of its borders is being violated by Serb
troops. NATO and US officials have repeatedly said they have no
intention of sending in ground forces. Although 6,000 NATO soldiers
will help with the humanitarian effort here and some 2,000 US
troops are expected to arrive in Albania in the coming days to
accompany 24 Apache helicopters, there was no indication of new
troop dispatches.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of the KLA repeated their pleas for outside help
and arms to supply the guerrilla force, whose aim is to create an
indepedent Kosovo outside of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview early Monday, three soldiers, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said they had arrived at the training camp
here less than two weeks and had been fitted with KLA uniforms and
rifles.
</P>
<P>
   They said their KLA counterparts in two strongholds within
Kosovo were running desperately low on supplies and had no more
than a few days of artillery left.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the men said they had fled Kosovo within the last year,
one to Germany, the other to Switzerland. The third said he was not
from Kosovo, but was instead a former member of the Albanian
military who had joined the KLA to provide training support.
</P>
<P>
   The third man said numberous other Albanians had joined the
force, in official and unofficial capacities, accompanying the
estimated 1,200 members of the Kosovo diaspora who are returning to
fight the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the new members have traveled from abroad to help defend
family members who are trapped inside Kosovo, according to the KLA
members interviewed and Dobbs, the Western monitor, who said he
spoken to KLA members who had come from as far as New York City.
</P>
<P>
   A KLA recruit from Germany said he still had two children and a
wife inside Malashava, although he had no way of knowing whether
they had fled or were even alive.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the Kosovars interviewed said they were planning to
cross the border as soon as possible. ``I'm going in three days,''
the soldier from Switzerland said. ``Our families in there, so we
are going to protect them.''
</P>
<P>
   Four KLA members have been killed and two injured in the border
skirmishes in the last two days, Dobbs said. Several Albanian
border police have been injured, as Serb troops have begun aiming
shells and sniper fire at the local military posts.
</P>
<P>
   The shelling at Kamenica grew so severe Monday that border
police were spending ``most of their time hiding in the bunkers,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The violence reignited last week, presumably as a result of KLA
forays into Kosovo, where they have secured two towns, Koshare and
Batusha, Dobbs said. Since then, however, Serb troops have becom
increasingly aggressive across the border, ``quite possibly to
escalate the conflict and provoke Albania,'' Dobbs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it was the original aim of the KLA to cause a
clash,'' he said. ``It seems they wanted to do reconnaissance and
to defend the refugees inside Kosovo.''

   If Ebay's diverse population is any indication, the new sites
may well find customers. A considerable part of the online auction
crowd is made up of longtime collectors who buy and sell off line
as well. But the Web seems to be igniting the collecting impulse
among those who might otherwise have been content to buy retail or
not at all.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Cannode, 23, a nurse in Kenton, Ohio, for instance,
recently began collecting My Little Ponies, which she remembers
fondly from her not-so-distant youth. After showing off her online
finds, Ms. Cannode must now contend for computer time with her
father, who scours the auction boards for Zippo lighters; her
mother, whose passion is Beanie Babies. and her brother, who
recently went to a Nascar race with tickets he bought on Ebay.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most seductive aspect of the auction is the scent of
a good bargain. Frequent bidders tend to develop elaborate
strategies to outwit the competition, from listing a top bid at the
outset and letting the computer take care of the rest, to swooping
in during the final minutes after competing bidders have shown
their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Darren Jer of Manhattan, who bought a digital camera
at a Cyberian Outpost auction last week for $620 plus $6 shipping,
come away crowing. ``When it comes to buying consumer electronics
equipment on the Web, I'm pretty assiduous about finding the best
price,'' said Jer, 25, who said he had never tried an auction
before. ``And I got this for $100 below market value. I'm a happy
customer.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are more familiar with the notorious ``winner's curse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got to have something, that will definitely push you
over the edge,'' said Tony Porzio, 38, of Albuquerque, N.M., who
concedes he may have overpaid just a tad for a 1964 World's Fair
subway map. ``But if you've got to have something, you'll pay what
you have to pay. That's really the beauty of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The other half of the equation is a country full of
entrepreneurs tickled to make a buck as they clean out their
basements. Mark Siegel, a computer programmer in Miami, has taken
to ransacking his closets for items to offer on Ebay. No wonder. So
far he has sold a Tori Amos CD, the import version of ``Upside
Down,'' for $142, and a copy of the first American issue of Maxim,
a men's magazine, that he describes as ``basically worthless'' for
$71. ``I personally get a thrill out of selling junk that I would
have probably thrown out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lavallie, 28, of the Bronx started out as a buyer but
quickly became a seller after hearing a friend's sheepish account
of having paid $325 for some ``Planet of the Apes'' action figures
that he could have bought at a toy store for $75.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a seller I just saw that people were insane enough to pay
ridiculous prices for some items,'' Lavallie said. ``It's not like
you actually have your cash in your hand, so you don't realize what
you're doing. You lose track of logic and reason.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact the barriers to selling on the Web through auction are
so minimal that a small but significant group of people have quit
their jobs to become full-time merchants. A much larger number sell
as a hobby or to make petty cash.
</P>
<P>
   Take Danny Friedman, a 12-year-old Manhattanite, who has
discovered that he can make up to $125 a month buying Beanie Babies
cheaply in New York City and reselling them to collectors in rural
areas. Just recently, he bought Spooky the ghost for $5 and
auctioned it off for $38.
</P>
<P>
   While hobbyists rushed in, more established retailers (even pure
Internet merchants) resisted the auction format, worried that a bad
customer experience could damage their name brand credibility. But
that's changing. Deva Hazarika, founder of MOAI, a firm that
designs auction software, has seen a surge of interest from
professionals looking for tools to differentiate their sites from
the crowd. ``Companies selling directly to consumer see it as a way
to create excitement,'' he said. It will not be long, he predicts,
before retailers routinely offer online auctions as an alternative
format for holding sales.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Van Kleeck, spokesman for the National Retail Federation,
also sees a future where traditional retailers use net auctions as
a possible way to dump excess inventory. ``Why not have a factory
outlet on line where people bid for goods?'' he asks. ``Ultimately,
it makes logical sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, sellers of fixed-price goods face pitfalls in
entering the auction venue. They must avoid, for example, the
potentially ire-inspiring situation where consumers end up bidding
more for merchandise than they would have paid in the store. The
Web site for Lands' End has been experimenting with reverse
auctions for almost two years. On Saturday it puts a limited
quantity of some clothing item, like a denim dress, on sale for 25
percent off, but alerts customers that as the week progresses it
will continue to mark down the goods. Customers then have to weigh
the extent of the discount against the likelihood of the item
selling out when deciding whether to bid, but they never risk being
burned by paying more than an item's original listed worth.
</P>
<P>
   But for some the spread of such clever efficiency could defeat
the whole purpose. ``It's spread the knowledge of what the market
price is to every tiny little town in the world,'' said William
Gibson, the science fiction author who coined the term
``cyberspace,'' and who wrote about his Ebay addiction in a recent
issue of Wired magazine. ``Sometimes I worry there will be such a
severe rationalization of the market that the fun will go out of
the hunt.''

COACH DENIES CHARGE LEVELED BY FORMER PUPIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard Callaghan, one of the world's most distinguished figure
skating coaches, has strongly denied charges that he engaged in
sexual misconduct with a former pupil who later became his coaching
assistant.
</P>
<P>
   In a story in Sunday's New York Times, Craig Maurizi said that
Callaghan, who directed Tara Lipinski to an Olympic gold medal and
Todd Eldredge to a world title at the Detroit Skating Club, had
initiated a sexual relationship with him when Maurizi was 15.
Maurizi, now a 36-year-old husband and father, said the
relationship continued sporadically until two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Times also reported that two other male skaters said
Callaghan had made sexual overtures to them and that a former
coaching colleague said three male skaters told her that Callaghan
had made sexual advances to them or others. Callaghan said the
reports were untrue.
</P>
<P>
   The 53-year-old Callaghan, who is married with a grown daughter,
did not return a phone call Monday but ``fervently denied''
Maurizi's charges through his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Callaghan and his family are shocked and deeply dismayed
that Mr. Maurizi has made these unsubstantiated allegations,''
Michigan attorney Dean Groulx said in a statement. ``They have
always viewed Mr. Maurizi as an invaluable member of their extended
family and hope he will be able to resolve his emotional
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Maurizi, who was traveling Monday and did not return a phone
call, has said he will file a formal grievance against Callaghan
with the US Figure Skating Association. The USFSA's top officials
were also traveling Monday and unavailable for comment. But a
spokesman said the association, which was aware of Maurizi's
allegations before the Times story, would wait until receiving the
grievance before proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Maurizi, who trained with and coached alongside Callaghan for
more than two decades and asked him to be best man at his wedding,
has been seeing a therapist to deal with what he later concluded
was an exploitative relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, I thought the sex was consensual,'' Maurizi told
the Times. ``Now, when I look back, I don't think it was
consensual. I don't care how old a student is, whether it's a boy
or a girl, a coach should never have sex with a student.''
</P>
<P>
   Callaghan, who announced last month that he would leave the
Detroit Skating Club at the end of the spring and retire from
active coaching after 27 years, has the most accomplished record of
any American coach in the last quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
   Besides coaching Lipinski to her Olympic victory at Nagano last
year, Callaghan has directed Eldredge to five world medals and five
US titles and was Nicole Bobek's coach when she won the 1995 US
crown and world bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
   Eldredge said Monday he was ``shocked'' by Maurizi's charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never experienced anything like that with Richard, so I
don't know what he's talking about,'' said the 27-year-old
Eldredge, who grew up in Chatham, Mass. and has been coached by
Callaghan since he was 10. ``Richard has been like a father to me,
especially with me living away from home for so long. I've been
pretty much a part of the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Maurizi, who is leaving the Detroit club to become skating
director at the New England Sports Center in Marlborough, Mass. in
June, began training with Callaghan in Buffalo when he was 13 and
followed him to Philadelphia and Colorado Springs.
</P>
<P>
   He said Callaghan began a sexual relationship with him two years
later and that they had hundreds of intimate encounters in hotels,
in rink offices, and at Callaghan's house. Maurizi said he ``never
had the guts'' to break with his mentor until recently.
</P>
<P>
   Maurizi told the Detroit Free Press that he met with Callaghan
for five hours in February before he decided to speak publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I confronted him, I asked him point-blank why he did to
me what he did . . . and he said, `To tell you the truth, I felt
that it was something that you wanted to do. That's why I did it,'
'' Maurizi said. Callaghan has denied discussing the issue with
him.
</P>
<P>
   After Maurizi retired from competitive skating in 1987, he was
Callaghan's assistant for several years in San Diego and joined him
again four years ago in Detroit. The two parted ways last year
after Lipinski switched from Callaghan to Maurizi. Callaghan has
said professional rivalry is the motive behind Maurizi's charges.

<P>
   ON THE GRAND TRUNK ROAD, India _ The buses, like this shiny
white one, run back and forth between New Delhi, India, and Lahore,
Pakistan, four days a week now, each a fragile thread suturing the
wound inflicted 51 years ago when these two nations were hacked
from Britain's Indian empire at independence.
</P>
<P>
   Emblazoned with the logo of Pakistan's Tourism Development
Corp., and loaded with ordinary Indians and Pakistanis, the bus
jounced through the potentially hostile territory of India, past
fields of cut hay and the humming factories of the Punjab. Indian
police vehicles escorted it for the eight-hour drive to the
Pakistani border.
</P>
<P>
   The bus carried Amna Khartoum, a toothless 65-year-old woman
from Bombay, to what will probably be a last reunion with her
youngest brother, who lives in Pakistan. A troupe of Pakistani
musicians fresh from a tour of India, an Indian scholar on his way
to do research in Islamabad, and bearded Muslim holy men going to a
wedding in Rawalpindi were also aboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only time will tell whether this bus will bring people
together, but it is a good thing that it has started,'' said Rafiq
Sutarrya, an Indian plywood salesman whose sentiments echoed those
of his fellow travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two months ago, the prime minister of India, Atal
Behari Vajpayee, made the inaugural ride on this new bus service.
It links two countries that have fought three wars since 1947 and
whose people have been largely cut off from each other for the
decades since, with only trickles allowed to travel into each
other's territory.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee emerged from the bus at the border and embraced his
Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz Sharif. Since then, the buses that
followed have become icons of the hope for peace and friendship
between two countries born in a paroxysm of religious hatred in
which an estimated million Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs perished.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif, leader of the Muslim nation of Pakistan, and Vajpayee,
head of predominantly Hindu India, promised in February that they
would seek to build closer ties and to overcome their bitter
history.
</P>
<P>
   Whether their bus diplomacy leads to something bigger or turns
into just another symbol of disappointment is now more uncertain
than ever. A nuclear competition between the two countries
continues. And the coalition government Vajpayee heads may lose its
majority in Parliament, possibly within the next week, and Sharif
could find himself without his dance partner.
</P>
<P>
   But high-level politics seemed to be the last thing on the minds
of passengers, who had each paid $38 for a round-trip ticket. The
Indians and Pakistanis on this Pakistani bus _ India has buses
making the trip too _ spent a couple of hours mesmerized by a
megahit Hindi movie from India _ a sugary romantic musical called
``Kuch Kuch Hota Hai'' (``Something Is Happening''), which played
on a screen suspended at the front of the bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Pakistan and India, the music is the same, the languages
are similar,'' said Fakhar Zaman, who plays the harmonium in a
well-known Qawwal, or traditional Sufi, musical group from Pakistan
that had just finished performing to packed houses in India.
``There are no barriers.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When the movie ended, the passengers dozed or sat staring
wordlessly out the windows. Most were either going to or coming
from family visits.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Khartoum, her stooped shoulders wrapped in a shawl of black
lace, was lost in thoughts of a past she had been unable to share
with the much younger brother she was on her way to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my mother was dying,'' she said, recalling a day when she
was a young woman and her brother but a boy, ``she put him on my
lap and said: `Look after him. He's yours.'''
</P>
<P>
   But that was 45 years ago. After her mother died, her father
moved with his young son to Pakistan to live with family there.
Mrs. Khartoum, who had just married, remained in India. On opposite
sides of the border, Mrs. Khartoum and her brother, a ship worker,
have seen each other only a few times in the intervening decades.
</P>
<P>
   On two earlier trips to Pakistan, she had taken an Indian train
to the border. There it had taken a grueling 12 hours to get
through customs. Once on the other side of the border, she had
boarded a Pakistani train.
</P>
<P>
   Her grown sons agreed to let their spindly, ailing mother go
this time, accompanied by her daughter and grandchildren, only
because she could take a comfortable, air-conditioned bus straight
through from New Delhi to Lahore, with a stop of only an hour or
two to clear customs at the border.
</P>
<P>
   Still haunted by the promise she made to her mother, Mrs.
Khartoum said she felt she had to see her brother one last time.
``I'm like his mother,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The bus has also opened a new route for cultural exchanges
between the countries. The Qawwali group, led by Badar Ali Khan,
has made two tours of India since Vajpayee's bus trip to Pakistan.
Their manager was able to get them visas in a day, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The young men, dressed in flowing white shalwar kameez, the
traditional dress of Pakistani men, said they wished the border
between Pakistan and India was as easy to cross as that between the
United States and Canada, where they have performed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we drove by car to Canada, the Americans just had to show
their drivers' licenses,'' said Fez Fareed Khan, who plays the
harmonium. ``If you could do that between India and Pakistan, life
would be easier for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Zaman, the group's pessimist, said, ``It can't happen here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Inshallah,'' replied the fatalistic chorus singer, Munawar
Hussein. ``God willing, it shall be done.''

PATRIOTS COULD BE LOOKING FOR OFFENSIVE LINEMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The Patriots didn't get much of a bang for the $37
million investment they made in veteran linemen Bruce Armstrong,
Todd Rucci, and Max Lane a year ago, and youngsters Ed Ellis, Damon
Denson, and Jason Andersen didn't grasp the opportunities dangled
in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, only Heath Irwin among the younger linemen will enter
the '99 season with a chance to be a starter _ at center, after
Dave Wohlabaugh left for Cleveland as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   All of which indicates that the Patriots could be big players in
the offensive line market in Saturday's draft. Some think the
Patriots will take as many as three linemen with their first five
picks, and many draft experts predict that they'll wind up with
Boston College center Damien Woody.
</P>
<P>
   Woody is projected as a first-rounder, which is not all that
common for centers. At 6 feet 3 inches, 328 pounds, he also could
play guard or even tackle in the NFL. Woody is very quick for a big
guy, running a 5.13 40-yard dash, and could definitely be an
effective run-blocker. Scouts say that the junior has not peaked
and that if he takes his talents even more seriously than he has,
he could be a dominating player in the league.
</P>
<P>
   The BC offensive linemen are considered to be well-coached and
strong on technique, which is why Doug Brzezinski is rated the top
guard in the nation by some scouts. At 6-4, 307, he's not as quick
as Woody, running a 5.4 40, but he has tremendous technique and
could be a second-rounder.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus top pick among offensive linemen is Brigham
Young's John Tait, who should be gone by the time the Patriots
pick. At 6-6, 310, Tait has great strength, quickness, and
toughness, and he does more than pass-block, which is usually the
strength of a BYU lineman.
</P>
<P>
   Right behind him is Wisconsin's Aaron Gibson, the most massive
tackle in the draft. Gibson is just under 6-7 and 390 pounds. He
can be a devastating run blocker, which is precisely what the
Patriots need, but he might give up something on the pass blocking
end, as his size makes him vulnerable to the outside rush.
</P>
<P>
   Eastern Michigan's L.J. Shelton, son of former Seattle Sonic
Lonnie Shelton, seems to be rising. At 6-5 1/2, 338, Shelton had a
big Senior Bowl and has tested well in front of scouts. He may be a
project, not someone to step in and play right away.
</P>
<P>
   Other possible first-rounders include Georgia's Matt Stinchcomb,
a talented tackle who may be the smartest of the available linemen;
Penn State's Floyd Wedderburn (6-5, 333), a converted defensive
tackle still trying to remove the stigma of a major knee injury in
1995; West Virginia's Solomon Page, who some believe should stay in
school another year; Michigan's Jon Jansen; and Baylor's Derrick
Fletcher (6-7, 374), who is pretty quick (5.25) for his size.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's Kris Farris, a 6-8, 315-pound tackle, gets a lot of
attention as the Outland Trophy winner and could go in the second
round. But scouts don't consider him as good as Tait, Shelton,
Gibson, or Woody.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's Zach Pillar, who broke combine records for bench
presses (225 pounds 40 times), could be an attractive guard to be
taken somewhere in the third round.
</P>
<P>
   If the Patriots don't take Woody, they could wait around for
other highly rated centers such as Arizona State's Grey Ruegamer or
Colorado State's Mike Newell.

CONVOY SQUABBLE WITH RUSSIANS POINTS UP HUNGARY'S DILEMMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUDAPEST _ It wasn't a scene Hungarians expected to see again,
so soon after joining as powerful a military force as NATO: five
Russian armored vehicles on Hungary's eastern border with Ukraine
demanding to get in Monday along with 68 trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Decades ago, it was Russian tanks that rolled into Hungary,
putting down a 1956 revolution attempt and cementing Russia's
then-Communist control over the Central European nation.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, Hungary held the military cards, and refused
entry to the truck convoy, which the Russians insisted held
humanitarian aid headed for Yugoslavia, a longtime ally of
Russia's.
</P>
<P>
   Russia warned that the episode could have ``grave
consequences,'' and deemed the detention of the trucks an
``unfriendly act.'' The dispute was resolved Monday afternoon, as
Hungary agreed to accept most of the trucks, turning back the
armor-plated vehicles and some trucks containing diesel fuel _ a
substance controlled by UN sanctions against Yugoslavia because it
could be used for the Yugoslav war effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We solved the question on a ministerial level in short
order,'' Interior Minister Sandor Pinter told reporters Monday.
``This humanitarian assistance will pass through Hungary.''
</P>
<P>
   The quibble with Russia defused, Hungary is still finding itself
in the middle _ caught between its new relationships with its
neighbors, and its even-newer commitment to NATO, which Hungary
lobbied so strongly to join.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pretty much the first case where Hungary was needed to
act in accord with international sanctions and stand up against the
Russians,'' Hungary's one-time mortal enemy, said political analyst
Attila Ledenyi. ``Of course, it would have been nice if we could
have celebrated the first month of NATO membership,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Hungary was officially admitted into NATO last month, and the
NATO assault on Yugoslavia, which lies right under Hungary's
southern border, began less than two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have our honeymoon,'' said Laszlo Poti, an analyst
with the Institute for Strategic and Defense Studies in Budapest.
``It is a paradox that we joined the `old' NATO, and instead found
ourselves in a `new' NATO, one with a ``much more activist role,''
Poti said.
</P>
<P>
   Geographically, Hungary is in a vulnerable position.
Land-locked, Hungary shares seven, porous international borders _
five of them with countries that until recently used to be part of
other countries. Hungary, a nation of just 10 million people, is
completely surrounded by non-NATO members.
</P>
<P>
   Hungary also has had to forge new relationships with nations
with whom it has had an uneasy past. Ukraine, on its eastern
border, used to be part of the hated Soviet Union; Hungary has had
squabbles with both Slovakia and Romania about the rights of ethnic
Hungarians living there.
</P>
<P>
   Hungary has been run over numerous times over the centuries, by
the Turks, the Mongols, the Germans, the Russians, the Austrians
and now, some nostalgic types here grumble _ by the American
capitalists. Hungary was on the losing side of both World Wars.
</P>
<P>
   The nation has had a reasonably friendly relationship with
Yugoslavia, where there is a substantial ethnic Hungarian
population in the northern Serbian province of Vojvodina.
</P>
<P>
   But the fight between NATO and Yugoslavia has forced Hungary to
the Western side, against some of its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Hungary will not send ground troops, should the war escalate to
that level. But Hungary has been a good metaphorical soldier for
NATO, allowing use of its air space and saying it is open to the
sending of Hungarian engineers and medical personnel as part of a
post-war peace-keeping mission.
</P>
<P>
   Gabor Horvath, spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, insists that
Hungary is not more vulnerable now that it has abandoned its Warsaw
Pact membership for NATO. Nor do the Hungarian people regret
joining the military alliance, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the Russian convoy, he said, ``First, the situation
could have happened as early as October,'' before Hungary was in
NATO. ``It is better to be in NATO when this is happening,'' so the
entire military alliance would protect Hungary if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   To the minority of NATO detractors, the Yugoslav war and the
Russian dispute are just two examples of why Hungary should have
stayed out of the military alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians are supposed to look ahead. But they didn't. They
looked West, where the money comes from,'' said Toma Sik of Alba
Kor, or Circle of Dawn, an anti-NATO group. ``We must replace a
Warsaw Pact with a capitalist NATO? What's the point?'' Sik said.
``A small country should be neutral.''

NATO WILL `STAY THE COURSE,' CLINTON SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BARKSDALE AIR FORCE BASE, La. _ With several B-52s arrayed on a
runway behind him, President Clinton vowed Monday to continue the
air war against Serbian forces until Slobodan Milosevic ends his
campaign of ``racial atrocities'' in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton condemned Milosevic for persecuting ethnic Albanians
``to erase the presence of these people in their own land
forever,'' and declared, ``We must not let that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the United States and its NATO allies remained
united and intended to keep pressure on Milosevic until he
withdraws his troops from Kosovo, permits the refugees to return
home, and allows an international peacekeeping force in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Declaring that NATO has ``the patience to deal with all the
questions and stay the course,'' Clinton said, ``There are a lot of
people who didn't think this alliance of 19 countries could do what
we have done and could stay together as we have stayed together.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hammered Milosevic for creating a situation in Kosovo
with ``thousands of innocent people uprooted, many of them killed,
some of them dying from disease in refugee camps, some families
divided forever, not because of anything they did, but because they
happen to be Albanian instead of Serbian, Muslim instead of
Orthodox Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   Under clear early-morning skies, Clinton flew to this base of
the Air Force's Second Bomb Wing to deliver thanks to personnel who
have been carrying out raids over the past three weeks and to
pledge his undiminished commitment to complete the mission.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting privately with crew members, Clinton made a public
address before several thousand Air Force personnel and hundreds of
civilian visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Though the president, who avoided the draft during the Vietnam
War, experienced unease when dealing with the armed forces early in
his administration, the reception here was warm. The crowd
punctuated Clinton's remarks with applause and cheers.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of demonstrators protesting the bombing campaign was
kept outside the base's gate.
</P>
<P>
   A poll conducted before his arrival by The Times, a newspaper
covering this region, found that 59 percent of respondents in the
area supported the NATO action. It also found that 45 percent
approved of Clinton's job performance compared to 38 percent who
disapproved.
</P>
<P>
   To underscore national solidarity, Clinton was accompanied by
members of his national security team, including the chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, and Defense
Secretary William S. Cohen, who hailed Clinton for placing ``our
nation on the right side of history'' in the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana's Democratic senators, John Breaux and Mary Landrieu,
were also on hand to praise the president. Breaux said Clinton
would be remembered for his ``leadership and understanding of the
history of the Balkans.'' Landrieu, a member of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, said: ``Mr. President, we're in it. Let's win
it!''
</P>
<P>
   After the program, several members of crews taking part in the
European operations were made available to reporters with the
understanding that they would not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   A major said he was satisfied Clinton was ``100 percent behind
us.'' Asked if servicemen were troubled by Clinton's lack of a
military background, the officer said, ``I don't think so. We've
seen Iraq and now we're seeing Kosovo. He's behind us, the
country's behind us, and that's a good feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale Air Force base was chosen as the site for the
commander in chief to voice his support for the American role in
the NATO operation because the B-52 base has a history of allied
engagements dating from the time French fighter pilots trained here
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   During his private meeting with Air Force personnel, Clinton
asked about the longevity of the B-52s and was assured that the
fleet would be good for another 40 years, according to a briefing
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that it had become ``much harder to get and keep
good people'' in the military, Clinton told the crowd he had
``listened carefully'' to the expressions of concern by crew
members during his personal talks, and he promised to take steps to
ensure better pay and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   As one measure, the president announced an executive order which
would extend tax deadlines and offer some income tax exemptions for
military personnel serving in the combat zone.

 &HT;    Atlanta teacher wins drama award
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Margaret Edson, an Atlanta kindergarten teacher who
wrote ``Wit,'' the off-Broadway drama about a woman with cancer,
won the 1999 Pulitzer Prize for drama Monday and said pizza was
next on her plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consolation prize, if I hadn't won it, was also a pizza,
though perhaps with not quite as much garlic on it,'' quipped the
playwright, sounding pleased but perfectly collected, her usual
witty self.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old Edson, who was unknown before ``Wit,'' her first
play, opened six months ago to rave reviews off-Broadway, received
the news from the play's New York press agent by phone at
Centennial Place School, where she was just finishing her teaching
day. She was to be joined at the late dinner by partner Linda
Merrill, a curator at the High Museum of Art. When asked to explain
the subdued celebration, Edson said with joking primness, ``It is a
school night, after all.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill, who offered to pick up the pizza tab, said, ``I'm
thrilled but not terribly surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wit'' was indeed a favorite for the Pulitzer Prize in drama,
but only after a long saga of proving itself against many doubters.
The starkly unsentimental but deeply moving portrait of an ovarian
cancer patient, based on Edson's experience as a volunteer social
worker and hospital clerk in her native Washington, was written in
1991. Only one theater (in Southern California) was willing to
produce it before 1997. Then a Connecticut theater mounted it, then
an off-off-Broadway company, which in January moved it into the
off-Broadway Union Square Theatre, where it's still selling out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that (the prize) affirms all of the people who took a
chance on the play,'' Edson said Monday. ``I've made many friends
among the many wonderful artists who've brought it to life.''
</P>
<P>
   The cast and crew reportedly plan to gather on the Union Square
stage to offer a champagne toast to Edson before tonight's
performance.
</P>
<P>
   The playwright, meanwhile, plans to be in her downtown classroom
bright and early today, as usual, and won't visit New York until
mid-May, when she's due to take part in an after-performance
symposium.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably Edson will also be on hand when the Alliance Theatre
mounts the play in its 1999-2000 season. By coincidence, the
Alliance is currently presenting the 1998 Pulitzer winner, Paula
Vogel's ``How I Learned to Drive''; Edson's Pulitzer marks the
first time that two women have won the prize in consecutive years.
Only 10 women have won or shared the Pulitzer for drama since it
was established in 1917.
</P>
<P>
   While many well-known playwrights won Pulitzers early in their
careers, at a younger age than Edson, no one in memory emerged so
suddenly from a nonwriting career. In fact, Edson is dedicated to
teaching as a lifelong calling and has written only one other play,
unproduced, which she describes as ``hokey'' celebration of country
gospel music. She will write another play ``if and when a
compelling idea strikes me.'' Even lucrative screenwriting offers
(a film version of ``Wit'' is being discussed) will not budge her
from the classroom, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Edson moved to Atlanta last summer when her partner, Merrill,
got her High Museum job. Edson soon signed on at Centennial Place,
where she quickly became known as an inventive teacher, setting
lessons to the tunes of Cole Porter and George Gershwin. Even while
being interviewed about the Pulitzer, she kept turning the subject
back to her teaching. She excitedly described her newest project,
``Six Legs Over Georgia,'' a lesson about insects set to the tune
of Buddy Holly' ``Peggy Sue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wit'' has generated some controversy with its unsparing view
of a medical establishment that's more interested in the heroine _
Vivian Bearing, a professor of 17th-century poetry _ as a test
specimen than a human being. Nor is the Bearing presented a noble
martyr, but rather as a haughty, aloof intellectual who earned her
own isolation. Though Bearing's sharp wit in the face of medical
indignities and certain death keeps audiences laughing even to the
point of tears, ``Wit'' is among the least commercial, least
``audience-friendly'' plays ever to win the Pulitzer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a play about kindness, the human touch,'' Edson said in
January, ``and one way to show that is through its opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   Edson was asked how she felt joining a pantheon of Pulitzer
winners that includes Vogel, Eugene O'Neill and Tennessee Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrific,'' said the teacher , ``I'm only sorry that
Sophocles couldn't be with us.''

   ON THE GRAND TRUNK ROAD, India _ The buses, like this shiny
white one, run back and forth between New Delhi, India, and Lahore,
Pakistan, four days a week now, each a fragile thread suturing the
wound inflicted 51 years ago when these two nations were hacked
from Britain's Indian empire at independence.
</P>
<P>
   Emblazoned with the logo of Pakistan's Tourism Development
Corp., and loaded with ordinary Indians and Pakistanis, the bus
jounced through the potentially hostile territory of India, past
fields of cut hay and the humming factories of the Punjab. Indian
police vehicles escorted it for the eight-hour drive to the
Pakistani border.
</P>
<P>
   The bus carried Amna Khartoum, a toothless 65-year-old woman
from Bombay, to what will probably be a last reunion with her
youngest brother, who lives in Pakistan. A troupe of Pakistani
musicians fresh from a tour of India, an Indian scholar on his way
to do research in Islamabad, and bearded Muslim holy men going to a
wedding in Rawalpindi were also aboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only time will tell whether this bus will bring people
together, but it is a good thing that it has started,'' said Rafiq
Sutarrya, an Indian plywood salesman whose sentiments echoed those
of his fellow travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two months ago, the prime minister of India, Atal
Behari Vajpayee, made the inaugural ride on this new bus service.
It links two countries that have fought three wars since 1947 and
whose people have been largely cut off from each other for the
decades since, with only trickles allowed to travel into each
other's territory.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee emerged from the bus at the border and embraced his
Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz Sharif. Since then, the buses that
followed have become icons of the hope for peace and friendship
between two countries born in a paroxysm of religious hatred in
which an estimated million Muslims, Hindus and Sikhs perished.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif, leader of the Muslim nation of Pakistan, and Vajpayee,
head of predominantly Hindu India, promised in February that they
would seek to build closer ties and to overcome their bitter
history.
</P>
<P>
   Whether their bus diplomacy leads to something bigger or turns
into just another symbol of disappointment is now more uncertain
than ever. A nuclear competition between the two countries
continues. And the coalition government Vajpayee heads may lose its
majority in Parliament, possibly within the next week, and Sharif
could find himself without his dance partner.
</P>
<P>
   But high-level politics seemed to be the last thing on the minds
of passengers, who had each paid $38 for a round-trip ticket. The
Indians and Pakistanis on this Pakistani bus _ India has buses
making the trip too _ spent a couple of hours mesmerized by a
megahit Hindi movie from India _ a sugary romantic musical called
``Kuch Kuch Hota Hai'' (``Something Is Happening''), which played
on a screen suspended at the front of the bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Pakistan and India, the music is the same, the languages
are similar,'' said Fakhar Zaman, who plays the harmonium in a
well-known Qawwal, or traditional Sufi, musical group from Pakistan
that had just finished performing to packed houses in India.
``There are no barriers.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When the movie ended, the passengers dozed or sat staring
wordlessly out the windows. Most were either going to or coming
from family visits.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Khartoum, her stooped shoulders wrapped in a shawl of black
lace, was lost in thoughts of a past she had been unable to share
with the much younger brother she was on her way to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my mother was dying,'' she said, recalling a day when she
was a young woman and her brother but a boy, ``she put him on my
lap and said: `Look after him. He's yours.'''
</P>
<P>
   But that was 45 years ago. After her mother died, her father
moved with his young son to Pakistan to live with family there.
Mrs. Khartoum, who had just married, remained in India. On opposite
sides of the border, Mrs. Khartoum and her brother, a ship worker,
have seen each other only a few times in the intervening decades.
</P>
<P>
   On two earlier trips to Pakistan, she had taken an Indian train
to the border. There it had taken a grueling 12 hours to get
through customs. Once on the other side of the border, she had
boarded a Pakistani train.
</P>
<P>
   Her grown sons agreed to let their spindly, ailing mother go
this time, accompanied by her daughter and grandchildren, only
because she could take a comfortable, air-conditioned bus straight
through from New Delhi to Lahore, with a stop of only an hour or
two to clear customs at the border.
</P>
<P>
   Still haunted by the promise she made to her mother, Mrs.
Khartoum said she felt she had to see her brother one last time.
``I'm like his mother,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The bus has also opened a new route for cultural exchanges
between the countries. The Qawwali group, led by Badar Ali Khan,
has made two tours of India since Vajpayee's bus trip to Pakistan.
Their manager was able to get them visas in a day, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The young men, dressed in flowing white shalwar kameez, the
traditional dress of Pakistani men, said they wished the border
between Pakistan and India was as easy to cross as that between the
United States and Canada, where they have performed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we drove by car to Canada, the Americans just had to show
their drivers' licenses,'' said Fez Fareed Khan, who plays the
harmonium. ``If you could do that between India and Pakistan, life
would be easier for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Zaman, the group's pessimist, said, ``It can't happen here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Inshallah,'' replied the fatalistic chorus singer, Munawar
Hussein. ``God willing, it shall be done.''

 &HT;    Kind words about Wohlers fill Braves clubhouse
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ If there were hard feelings that Mark Wohlers
refused his minor league assignment and thereby effectively ended
his Braves career, they were hard to find around the Braves
clubhouse on Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he feels he needs a different change of scenery,'' Ryan
Klesko said. ``We're going to definitely miss him. We're all
pulling for him, especially with the way he threw in the spring. I
figured he'd go down (to the minor leagues) and get right again.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Cox called Wohlers in Atlanta on Monday afternoon
to wish him well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's smart on his part,'' Cox said. ``There will be 29
clubs clamoring to get him. I think a fresh start will be good for
him. I'm pulling for him. I hope he goes to the American League and
shoots lights out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves have until 2 p.m. Friday to trade or release Wohlers.
If they release him, they owe him his $5.2 million salary, plus the
$800,000 buyout for his option year. If they trade him, they will
likely only get compensated for a small fraction of Wohlers'
salary. Either way, the business relationship is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess he's my ex-teammate now, but he's still my friend,''
Greg Maddux said. ``Obviously he feels going to a different
organization is in his own best interest and I support him 100
percent. I totally understand. Am I surprised? Yeah, but I think
you're always surprised the first time something like this
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Chipper Jones: ``I would have liked to see him work his
problems out in Atlanta. But a guy's got to do what a guy's got to
do. Maybe a change of scenery will help him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullpen health update
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Mike Remlinger has played catch each of the last two
days and has his eye on returning to action when he's eligible to
come off the disabled list on Sunday when the Braves are in Denver.
Remlinger has been on the DL since April 3 with a pulled lat muscle
in his back. He's been treating it with heat and taking
anti-inflammatory medicine. He plans to test it by throwing a
little harder on Wednesday....
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Kevin McGlinchy had to leave Monday's game after taking
a hard hit ball in the right hand off the bat Mike Lieberthal in
the eighth inning. McGlinchy's hand was bruised around the base of
his right thumb. He'll re-evaluate it on Thursday after taking
today off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sore,'' McGlinchy said. ``But no bone, just flesh. I'll
see (Thursday) if the grip bothers me.''...
</P>
<P>
   John Rocker had back spasms on Monday and was unavailable to
pitch, Cox said. So Rudy Seanez pitched the final two outs of the
eighth and the entire ninth and picked up his first save of the
season along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Boyz II Men, the singing group from Philadelphia, was scheduled
to perform the national anthem before Monday's game but cancelled
when only two of the four singers were late. Group spokesman
Quadree El-Amin sent along their apologies, saying they got stuck
in traffic.

COMMENTARY: RUSSIAN ROULETTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talk about strange bedfellows ...
</P>
<P>
   The game of footsie that Israel's prime minister, Benjamin
Netanyahu, and his foreign minister, Ariel Sharon, have been
playing lately with Yevgeny Primakov, Russia's prime minister,
surely takes the cake.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing wrong with Israel's trying to foster better
ties with Moscow in hopes of eliciting Russian cooperation in the
Middle East. In fact, if done in a sophisticated, strategic
fashion, it could really make sense. But to launch such an
initiative, primarily in order to gain Russian votes in Israel's
upcoming election _ after years of hammering on the White House,
Congress and U.S. Jewish groups to impose sanctions on Russia _ and
then to do it without any prior coordination with Israel's closest
ally, America, is reckless.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's recent visit to Moscow _ and Sharon's decision to
tone down any criticism of the Serbs and to be restrained in his
support for NATO's operation in Kosovo _ appear driven by poll
numbers: Russian Jews now make up 15 percent of the Israeli
electorate. Netanyahu understands from his polling that he is in
trouble with his traditional supporters among both Sephardic Jews
and nationalist settlers. The Sharon-Netanyahu strategy is to
compensate for that weakness by winning over the vast majority of
Israel's new Russian immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   But these are not your grandmother's Russian Jews _ those who
left Russia as ``refuseniks'' in the 1970s, with bitter memories of
Cossacks and commissars. This recent huge influx of Russian Jews to
Israel left the former Soviet Union freely, after the collapse of
Communism, and they still have some warm feelings about Mother
Russia, and many business dealings. So the Netanyahu-Sharon
strategy has been to cultivate the Russian vote by cultivating the
Russian government. During Netanyahu's recent trip to Moscow, word
was ``leaked'' to Israeli reporters that Primakov said that if he
were an Israeli he would vote for Bibi.
</P>
<P>
   Says the Haaretz diplomatic writer David Makovsky: ``When you
think of everything that Primakov represents for Israelis _ we're
talking about a guy who boasts that he has good chemistry with
Saddam Hussein _ it boggles the mind that someone would want his
endorsement.''
</P>
<P>
   Primakov leaked his endorsement of Netanyahu the same day he
departed for Washington to win U.S. backing for a new IMF loan.
Shortly after, Netanyahu personally asked the IMF to give the
Russians the $4.8 billion loan they were seeking. This after months
of Israel asking the United States to suspend emergency aid to
Moscow until Russia stopped selling nuclear materials to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't get much more cynical than this _ just
coincidentally a month before Israeli elections, Bibi suddenly
starts chasing after the Russians,'' says one senior U.S. official.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish lobbying organizations on Capitol Hill refuse to comment
on Israel's Russia adventures. But at a time when these lobbyists
have been trying to persuade Congress to squeeze Moscow to curtail
Russian business deals with Israel's enemies, the Jewish lobbying
groups are clearly upset and feeling that Israel's out-of-the-blue
overture to Moscow is compromising their effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``A high proportion of Israel's international strength derives
from its close relationship with Washington,'' said Itamar
Rabinovich, the former Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. and the
author of a smart new book on Israeli-Arab relations called
``Waging Peace.'' ``But if that Israeli influence in Washington is
abused, and relations are undermined, Israel will find itself with
empty pockets in dealing with other parts of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder that Israel's top military analyst, Ze'ev Schiff,
wrote that ``Sharon's Russia strategy, in which the U.S. decidedly
plays second fiddle, infuriates [Defense Minister Moshe) Arens. ...
The initiative, maintains Arens, hobbles Israel's struggle against
the immediate Iranian threat to our survival, a threat that Russia
is promoting. Principally, however, argues Arens, the issue could
undermine Israeli-American relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the same old story with Bibi. His defense minister
is pulling one way, his foreign minister another, and he shuttles
between the two depending on which position will advance his
political interests today. The only strategy is political and the
only sacred principles are what will get him re-elected.

IT'S NOT JUST IN YOUR BEDROOM: WOMEN IN 20S AND 30S TURNING AWAY
FROM SEX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It used to be that she never stopped thinking about it,
anticipating yet another romantic encounter with her husband. She
bought sexy lingerie, painted her toenails and shaved her legs.
</P>
<P>
   And then the children came. First a son and then another one 18
months ago. As responsibilities soared at her home, at her private
law practice, in the community, her libido sagged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now when I crawl into bed at night, all I want is to read a
little bit,'' the 40-year-old attorney says. ``The last thing on my
mind is sex, and unfortunately that's night after night after
night.''
</P>
<P>
   If this seems like a singular existence or one limited to the
baby-boomer crowd, that is hardly the case. Contrary to popular
belief, everyone is not having more and better sex than you.
</P>
<P>
   In fact there is so little going on _ for lack of female libido
_ in the nation's bedrooms, it has inspired a book by former model
and television talk-show host Cristina Ferrare.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled to be in bookstores nationwide next month, ``Okay So I
Don't Have a Headache: What I Learned (And What All Women Need to
Know) About Hormones, PMS, Stress, Diet, Menopause _ And Sex'' is
the 49-year-old Ferrare's first-person account of her sleeping
libido and what she did to restore the passion in her marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrare says she had been struggling with limited libido for
three years, when she suddenly blurted out on national television
that she had lost interest in sex and feared for her marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Then ``The Oprah Winfrey Show'' and ``Dateline'' called to
interview her about her public revelation. After those shows, she
heard from thousands of other women suffering from the same
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judging from the responses I received, women who want it are
in the minority,'' says Ferrare, who is scheduled to appear on
``Oprah'' again in May. ``Most of the women I talk to are having a
real problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But what surprised her most, Ferrare says, is that the majority
of women who wrote to her are ages 24 to 38.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I was ready to help my fellow baby boomers get through
this transition,'' she writes in ``Okay,'' ``when I realized that
this was a larger, more serious problem than I thought, involving
women of all ages.''
</P>
<P>
   According to research published this year in the Journal of the
American Medical Association, more than 40 percent of American
women ages 18 to 59 report some sort of sexual dysfunction, such as
lacking interest in or enjoyment of sex, performance anxiety, or
inability to achieve or hold off orgasm. In addition, it said that
women ages 18 to 39 were slightly more likely than older women to
report a lack of interest in sex or performance anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much more common than reaches the ear of physicians
because problems with sexuality are among the most difficult to
discuss,'' says Dr. Marianne Legato, founder-director of the
Partnership for Women's Health at Columbia University. ``I think
it's time we pulled up the shade and let some light in on what is
obviously a very difficult subject to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ferrare went to her doctor, she found that a lack of
testosterone in her body was key to her loss of sexual interest.
The doctor prescribed a testosterone cream, she says, that put her
back in the mood and thrilled her husband.
</P>
<P>
   But because she was facing menopause, Ferrare says she wanted to
find out more about how hormone levels affect the body and how
``everything we do and eat affects our hormone levels.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Okay, So I Don't Have a Headache,'' which includes excerpts
from some of the letters she received and 50 pages of recipes that
helped to improve her diet and overall well-being, is a candid and
often witty account of what she went through and what she learned
along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times when I was writing the book, my husband asked,
`Do you have to leave that in?''' she recalls, laughing. ``But he's
really proud of what I've done, because if this can help one
husband understand what a woman goes through, I've done a great
service.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   TWO WOMEN'S STORIES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Annette is a 38-year-old Fort Worth librarian and mother of four
children. Her sex life with her husband of five years comes down to
this: once or twice a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be every day,'' she says. ``Now I don't even think
about it. I don't want to touch. I don't want to kiss.''
</P>
<P>
   But not unlike the 40-year-old attorney, who asked not to be
identified, she only makes love with her husband when she starts to
feel guilty.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney says: ``He wants to know what's wrong with me. I
tell him I'm still attracted to him. I don't fully understand it
myself so it's hard to explain to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Both women say they have sought help from their physicians, and
both doctors attributed the problem to stress.
</P>
<P>
   But other experts say that, in all likelihood, it is probably
more than that.
</P>
<P>
   Legato and Dr. Joseph McWherter, a Fort Worth obstetrician and
gynecologist who specializes in hormone replacement, say that a
loss of libido may signal any range of physical impairments,
including hormonal imbalance, poor nutrition, depression and
fatigue from chronic sleep deprivation. It can also be caused by
negative emotions like anger or anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many times women will come to me and say, `My sex life with my
husband is nonexistent,'' says Legato. ``And I say, `What about on
vacation?' and they say, `It's fine.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen many women responsible for small children abandon
all need for a personal life because the needs of the children are
so compelling. Somebody once said, for example, that it's hard to
play an active game of tennis and feel depressed at the same
moment. I think that when we are in situations of intense demand,
luxury functions like introspection, meditation, and libido are
suspended.''
</P>
<P>
   McWherter says that 40 percent to 50 percent of women he sees
each week are complaining of some problem with libido, often
related to job stress and marriage difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this, McWherter recently decided to add a question
about libido on his patient questionnaire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them are not going to talk about it unless it's
asked,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of suffering in silence, doctors say women should be
proactive when it comes to their sexual health.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every woman who feels her sexual desire has changed
should have a complete physical exam to make sure there is no
condition that would make it difficult for her,'' says Legato.
``That's easier than going on and not having any possibility of
knowing what is wrong. I have never met a patient who didn't feel
better after at least inquiring about it.''
</P>
<P>
   McWherter says that in his practice, low testosterone levels in
women have been a common problem.
</P>
<P>
   The male hormone does three basic things, he says. ``It gives a
woman a sense of well-being, provides an energy boost and is linked
with improved libido and also is responsible for the sensitivity of
the clitoris, so it enhances orgasm.''
</P>
<P>
   Estrogen also plays an important role in libido, McWherter says,
because in many cases it relieves such symptoms as depression,
anxiety, fatigue and insomnia, all things that suppress the sex
drive.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrare admits she was skeptical when her doctor prescribed the
testosterone cream for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I walked out of the office, I said to myself `This cannot
be this easy,''' she recalls. ``But it worked. I'm not back to
where I was when I was 19 or 20, but at least when my husband
reaches for me, I respond.''

   CLINTON-CONTEMPT (Washington) _ Judge Webber Wright finds
President Clinton in civil contempt for his lies in the Paula Jones
civil deposition. She wrote: ``It is difficult to construe the
president's sworn statements ... as anything other than a willful
refusal to obey this court's discovery orders.'' The judge said,
``The record demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the
president responded to plaintiffs' questions by giving false,
misleading and evasive answers that were designed to obstruct the
judicial process.'' By John M. Broder.

   MCDOUGAL-TRIAL (Little Rock, Ark.) _ A federal jury today
acquitted Susan H. McDougal of obstructing justice for her refusal
to testify before a grand jury about the Arkansas financial
dealings of President Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
But the jury, in its third day of deliberations, deadlocked on two
other counts of criminal contempt and the judge, George Howard Jr.,
declared a mistrial. Although the jury's action was a mixed result,
it amounted to a setback for Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel
for Whitewater matters who Ms. McDougal claimed was out to get

the natural flow of water that once stretched in a continuous sheet

PULITZERS AWARDED FOR 83RD TIME

staff, with Jeff Gerth singled out, won in national reporting for
articles on the sale of American techonology to China, pushing its
total number of Pulitzers to 79. (The Boston Globe is owned by The
New York Times Co.)
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal garnered the international reporting
prize for its coverage of the Russian financial crisis, and the
Journal's Angelo B. Henderson took the feature writing Pulitzer for
his portrait of a man driven to violence after being a crime victim
himself. The Associated Press captured Pulitzers in the spot news
and feature photography categories for its photographs of the
embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania and for a collection of
pictures capturing the yearlong White House impeachment scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Pulitzer winners in the letters and drama categories included
Michael Cunningham's ``The Hours'' in the fiction category;
Margaret Edson's play ``Wit'' _ performed last summer at the
Shakespeare and Company in Lenox _ in the drama category; and A.
Scott Berg's ``Lindbergh'' in the biography category. A special
citation was awarded to the late jazz great Edward Kennedy ``Duke''
Ellington, commemorating the centennial year of his birth.
</P>
<P>
   The Courant's breaking news stories on the Connecticut Lottery
massacre in March 1998 in which a gunman killed four coworkers and
then himself, earned the paper its second ever Pulitzer. The story
broke only a month after new editor Brian Toolan took over the
reigns in the newsroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good on behalf of the pros who made it happen,'' said
a celebratory Toolan Monday. ``We at least attempted to to put
answers'' to the lottery tragedy. ``Our narrative approach on how
it happened was exceptional.''
</P>
<P>
   A victorious Dowd _ who helped transform Beltway and New York
Times journalism with her character-based dissections of the
nation's leading politicians _ told the Associated Press Monday,
``My reaction is I'm just so grateful to President Clinton that he
never spoke the words, `Young lady, pull down that jacket and get
back to the typing pool.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Several other leading newspapers also took home Pulitzers
Monday. The Washington Post won in the public service category
(which earns the winner a gold medal instead of the usual $5,000
prize) for a series that examined careless gunplay by municipal
police officers. Chuck Philips and Michael A. Hiltzik of the Los
Angeles Times took beat reporting honors for stories on corruption
in the entertainment industry. And Blair Kamin of the Chicago
Tribune won for criticism for his coverage of Chicago's
architecture, with particular emphasis on the city's famous
lakefront.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Herald earned the Pulitzer in investigative reporting
for unearthing the pervasive voter fraud in a city mayoral election
that was eventually overturned. The (Portland) Oregonian's Richard
Read won a Pulitzer in explanatory reporting for his profile of a
local french fry exporter that illustrated the domestic impact of
the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The editorial board of the (N.Y.) Daily News won in the
editorial writing category for its campaign to rescue the
threatened Apollo Theatre landmark. And the editorial cartooning
winner was David Horsey of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
</P>
<P>
   Although The Hartford Courant was the only New England winner,
four Boston entries also made it to the finals of the journalistic
Pulitzer competition. The Boston Globe earned three finalist spots.
Delores Kong's and Robert Whitaker's work disclosing how
psychiatric researchers callously performed drug experiments on
mentally ill patients was a finalist in public service. Globe book
critic Gail Caldwell was a finalist in criticism. And Globe
photographer Bill Greene's images reflecting the work of Donald
Anderson, who helps the residents of poor Southern communities
improve their lives, earned him a finalist designation in feature
photography. Clay Bennett, of The Christian Science Monitor, was a
finalist in editorial cartooning.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the letters and drama competition, Edwin G. Burrows
and Mike Wallace won the history award for ``Gotham: A History of
New York City to 1898'' while the general nonfiction prize was
given to John McPhee for his book ``Annals of the Former World.''
Mark Strand's ``Blizzard of One'' took top honors in the poetry
competition, and the Pulitzer for music was awarded to Melinda
Wagner for ``Concerto for Flute, Strings and Percussion'' which was
premiered last May by the Westchester Philharmonic in Purchase,
N.Y.

   RADUSA, Macedonia _ After fleeing Kosovo with hundreds of
thousands of other ethnic Albanians, Florije Havolli watched in
horror last week as an abscess on her 18-month-old daughter's
throat steadily grew larger. Three separate times, she asked the
Macedonian police ringing the refugee camp here to allow her
daughter, Arietta, to go to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was having problems breathing,'' Ms. Havolli said. ``She
couldn't drink. She couldn't get milk out of the bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   But Macedonian officials, who run this squalid tent city of
3,000 on a barren hillside in northeastern Macedonia, refused to
allow her to leave or let international aid groups enter. After a
meeting between the Macedonian government and relief agencies on
Saturday, aid agencies were finally allowed to enter the camp.
</P>
<P>
   Relief workers rushed Ms. Havolli's daughter to an Israeli army
field hospital. Dr. Jacob Adler, the pediatrician who treated
Arietta, said she could have died if the abscess had become
infected. ``We escaped from there to save our lives,'' Ms. Havolli
said bitterly. ``Now these people here almost killed my daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Conditions in the camp, international aid workers said, are far
below those of the half-dozen camps erected by NATO soldiers and
run by international aid organizations. The Radusa camp is the
latest example, they said, of the Macedonian government's callous
treatment of 130,000 ethnic Albanian refugees who have poured over
the border from Kosovo in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers accuse the government of mistreating refugees as
part of an effort to get them to resettle in camps in neighboring
Albania. Ethnic Macedonians, who make up a majority of the
population here, fear that they could be reduced to a minority in
their own country if ethnic Albanians from Kosovo resettle here.
Before the crisis began, 22 percent of Macedonia's 2 million people
were ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   During the first week refugees poured in from Kosovo, heavily
armed Macedonian policemen corralled a seething mass of 40,000
Albanians in a makeshift refugee camp in the border town of Blace.
</P>
<P>
   With no warning, the Macedonian police then bused and flew the
refugees en masse on Wednesday night to Greece, Turkey, Albania and
a half-dozen smaller camps around the country, including Radusa.
Refugees were beaten by the police and families were separated
during the frenzied process.
</P>
<P>
   Emilija Geleva, an adviser to the Macedonian prime minister,
Ljubco Georgievski, said Macedonia had done its best with limited
resources to care for the refugees. She said aid agencies were
allowed access to the Radusa camp if they were properly registered
with the government.
</P>
<P>
   But aid groups say that they were blocked from entering the camp
and that facilities there must improve. ``Some of the conditions
are unacceptable,'' said Paula Ghedini, a spokeswoman for the U.N.
high commissioner for refugees. ``We are currently negotiating with
the government of Macedonia to take it over.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Radusa, families live in burlap tents on a rock-strewn
hillside with swirling winds that create bitterly cold nights,
refugees said. With no drainage system, a rainstorm on Friday night
sent water coursing down the hillside, flooding tents laid out on
bare ground.
</P>
<P>
   Six latrines serve 3,000 people, a single trash container
overflows with putrid refuse, and there is no running water.
Cardboard boxes lined with plastic bags function as makeshift sinks
where women wash clothes. Dr. Ferko Ory, who is working in the camp
for the group Doctors Without Borders, said he feared the spread of
disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``The water and sanitary facilities are absolutely
unacceptable,'' he said. ``Thirty babies I treated yesterday had
diarrhea.''
</P>
<P>
   In many of the NATO-built camps, by comparison, the health-care
situation has stabilized, septic systems and showers are being
installed, and communal sinks provide running water. Foreign aid
agencies provide services ranging from toys for children to
satellite phones with which refugees tell anxious relatives they
have survived.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees shipped here by the Macedonian police were stunned
to hear of the better conditions in other camps. ``We didn't know
anything _ they just brought us here,'' said Idriz Rexhepi, a
52-year-old farmer living in a tent with his wife. ``I haven't
taken a shower in three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the alienation, aid workers said, is tight security.
Policemen armed with Kalashnikov assault rifles patrol the camp's
perimeter. Refugees, even if they have money of their own, are not
allowed to venture down the hill into the town to buy food.
Visitors to the camp are not allowed inside, and reunions occur
only through a 6-foot-tall wire mesh fence as a policeman looks on.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Geleva, the Macedonian government official, said the police
were present to halt smuggling. But Astrit Bajrinovci, a
32-year-old refugee whose family lives beside an overflowing trash
container in the camp, said he felt like a prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a concentration camp,'' he said. ``We want to call
our families and tell them we are alive, but we can't.''

BOSTON TO HOST OLYMPIC CONGRESS IN 2002

<P>
   Boston has been awarded the rights to host the United States
Olympic Congress in 2002, the Massachusetts Sports Partnership and
the Greater Boston Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 of the most powerful sports leaders in the
country are scheduled to attend the meeting, including heads of the
national governing bodies of individual Olympic sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fairly small event in terms of the revenue the event
itself will produce, locally,'' said Lou Kovacs, the marketing
coordinator of the sports partnership. ``But, with all of the
various officials of all of the individual sports coming in, it is
going to be a real chance to show off Boston as a potential venue
for their championships and other events in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time the US Olympic Congress will meet in New
England, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The annual meeting consists of workshops and educational
sessions designed to encourage participation in the Olympics and to
instruct those representing the individual sports about how to
foster sponsorship and licensing relationships, officials said. It
includes an extensive exhibition in which companies display the
goods and services they offer to the Olympics and the sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably going to generate about $1.8 million locally,
considering we need space in three hotels and the fact that the
different groups and organizations will be in town for four or five
days,'' said Patrick B. Moscaritolo, president of the Boston
Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau. ``But, if in the process of showing a
lot of these people our town and the services we can offer for the
various events within their sports it leads to other events, it
could yield tens of millions of dollars, eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic Congress includes a youth program called Champions
In Life in which dozens of Olympians from New England will visit
local middle and high schools to promote sports, education and
Olympic ideals.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting will be among a series of Olympic-related events in
Boston over the next several years, said Soosie L. Lazenby,
president of the sports partnership, a private, nonprofit
corporation established in 1993 to further the development and
growth of sports in the area. Those events include the meeting of
the board of directors of the US Olympic Committee in 2000, the
2000 US Olympic Gymnastics Trials and the 2001 US Figure Skating
Championships.

 &HT;    Financial burden the latest storm to hit weary Ohioans

<P>
   WARREN COUNTY, Ohio _ After the roar of Friday morning's tornado
faded into the distance, Bill and Joy Pace looked out the window
into the predawn darkness, hoping to see what had just happened.
</P>
<P>
   Darkness prevented the Warren County couple from seeing the
carnage that surrounded their 1834 farmhouse. But the Hamilton Twp.
couple saw something missing _ the trees.
</P>
<P>
   When dawn finally broke, they got a clearer picture: the tornado
had uprooted or snapped 29 beech, white pine and ash trees from
decades-old moorings, tossing them around the couple's property
like toothpicks.
</P>
<P>
   While their insurance will cover structural damage, such as lost
shingles, to their home and barn, they question how they can afford
to remove the downed trees from their property.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how we can do it on our budget,'' Joy Pace said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The couple hopes someone will take the trees for firewood or
lumber.
</P>
<P>
   Residents and officials continued Monday to grapple with the
post-tornado cleanup of Warren, Hamilton and Clinton counties. In
Deerfield Twp. south of Lebanon, for example, state road crews
moved and mulched trees while technicians from Time Warner Cable
and Cinergy worked on downed lines.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents like Patricia Maynes, whose Deerfield Twp. home
was damaged when a tree hit her roof, postponed full-scale cleanup
until her insurance adjustor could assess the damage later this
week. The Paces also awaited a meeting with their insurance agent
before they begin cleaning up the damage.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Young, director of emergency services for Warren County
Emergency Management, said that Federal Emergency Management Agency
officials will visit Warren County today as part of a larger
inspection of southwestern Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Gov. Bob Taft's said Lt. Gov. Maureen O'Conner
will accompany FEMA officials today as they survey the devastation.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Small Business Administration estimates the tornado
damaged 630 homes throughout southwestern Ohio, leaving 130
uninhabitable. SBA officials tallied the damage at $5.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Warren County officials estimate the county sustained about $2.2
million damage.
</P>
<P>
   The SBA hasn't finished assessing the damage to businesses and
the agency postponed a decision on whether to provide disaster
loans until the White House determines whether the region qualifies
for FEMA grants.
</P>
<P>
   In Warren County, Young said state, county and township crews
continue to pick up downed trees in Hamilton and Deerfield
townships, a process he expects to last through the end of the
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seem to be making pretty good progress,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   In Sycamore Twp., workers from the Ohio Department of
Transportation as well as Columbia and Delhi townships used
front-loaders, wood chippers and trucks to remove debris. Countless
volunteers handed out food, carried debris and helped bury pets.
</P>
<P>
   Against a backdrop of piled bricks, scattered clothes and
abandoned children's toys, Sycamore Twp. Administrator Lori
Thompson said township officials look for cleanup to take another
six weeks. On Monday, sheriff's deputies continued to block
affected neighborhoods and township officials limited the number of
volunteers so heavy equipment could remove debris.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson didn't rule out asking the Ohio National Guard for help
in clearing the neighborhood, but said the township first must max
out state transportation crews before seeking help from the guard,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other northern Cincinnati suburbs affected by the storm also
were continuing cleanup efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect by the end of this coming week, the reconstruction
will be ready to start,'' said Marvin Thompson, city manager of
Blue Ash.
</P>
<P>
   Demolition began over the weekend in Blue Ash. Montgomery
residents have been asked to clear their belongings from severely
damaged homes so demolition can begin Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sycamore Twp. is making contractors register with the township
to cut down on con-men who might prey upon distraught residents
needing home repairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern, obviously, is fraud,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Classes were canceled today in the Sycamore school district,
which encompasses the area. Sycamore High School suffered $1
million in damage and many streets remained closed or clogged with
repair trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot keep kids out of harm's way with so many
construction vehicles on the roads,'' Superintendent Bruce
Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   Red Cross counselors were available to talk to residents
traumatized by the tornado, which touched down during the predawn
hours. Two motorists and a couple swept from their home were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like a war. It'll change you,'' said Dr. Edward
Otten, who was at the tornado scene with Hamilton County's Urban
Search and Rescue Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   Lee and Jacque Cook died when the tornado hit their home. Daryl
Coffey of Kings Mills found Cook's gasoline credit card over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm seven or eight miles away from their house,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Lasiewski found a magazine belonging to Cook on top of his
roof in Maineville, in Warren County about five miles away from the
couple's home.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio National Guard will provide relief this week for weary
police departments watching over the ravaged neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the 324th Military Police Co. from Middletown will
help provide security, control traffic and offer other assistance
in Blue Ash and Montgomery beginning today.
</P>
<P>
   The suburbs asked Taft's office for National Guard help on
Sunday, spokesman Scott Milburn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it looks like they're going to basically (help) the
local police, who are obviously in need of some relief. They've
been going strong for the past few days,'' Milburn said.
</P>
<P>
   The unit from Middletown will staff eight one-person posts 24
hours a day in Blue Ash and a couple of two-person posts during
daylight hours.
</P>
<P>
   Staff Sgt. Jim Desrosiers said his troops were guarding damaged
businesses in an industrial park hit hard by the tornado.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the buildings are falling down so we're keeping people
away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Tresslar writes for the Dayton Daily News, Dayton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Staff Writer Scott Montgomery of the Washington Bureau and The
Associated Press contributed to this report.
</P>
<P>
   How you can help
</P>
<P>
   Area Kroger stores are accepting donations of non-perishable
foods, such as canned and boxed foods and cleaning supplies, such
as bleach and mops.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart stores accepting cleaning supplies and money, which
they will forward to the Salvation Army. Tax break for victims
</P>
<P>
   Families affected by the tornado will get a reprieve from filing
state taxes, with the deadline pushed back from Thursday to Aug.
16, Gov. Bob Taft announced.
</P>
<P>
   Affected families should call (800) 282-4310 to become eligible
for an extension.

BIN LADEN'S MESSAGE MORE POWERFUL THAN HIS MEANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   American commandos are poised near the Afghan border, hoping to
capture Osama bin Laden, the man charged with blowing up two
American embassies in Africa eight months ago, senior American
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   But they still do not know how to find him. They are depending
on his protectors in Afghanistan to betray him _ a slim reed of
hope for one of the biggest and most complicated international
criminal investigations in American history.
</P>
<P>
   Capturing bin Laden alive could deepen the complications.
American officials say that so far, firsthand evidence that could
be used in court to prove that he commanded the bombings has proven
difficult to obtain.
</P>
<P>
   For now, federal prosecutors in New York are building a case
that his violent words and ideas, broadcast from an Afghan cave,
incited terrorist acts thousands of miles away.
</P>
<P>
   In their self-declared war with bin Laden, American officials
portray him as the world's most dangerous terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   But reporters for The New York Times and the PBS program
``Frontline,'' working in cooperation, have found him to be less a
commander of terrorists than an inspiration for them.
</P>
<P>
   Enemies and supporters, from members of the Saudi opposition to
present and former American intelligence officials, say he may not
be as globally powerful as some American officials have publicly
asserted. But his message and aims have more resonance among
Muslims around the world than has been understood here.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can kill Osama bin Laden today or tomorrow; you can arrest
him and put him on trial in New York or in Washington,'' said Ahmed
Sattar, an aide to Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the blind Egyptian
cleric convicted of inspiring the bombing of the World Trade Center
in 1993. ``If this will end the problem _ no. Tomorrow you will get
somebody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with senior American officials and knowledgeable
observers of bin Laden in Pakistan, Sudan and elsewhere, suggest
that there is widespread support among ordinary people in the
Muslim world for his central political argument: that American
troops should get out of Saudi Arabia. The embassy bombings, they
note, took place eight years to the day after the GI's were ordered
onto Saudi soil.
</P>
<P>
   The interviews also raise questions about key assertions that
have been made by the government about bin Laden. Senior
intelligence officials concede that their knowledge of him is
sketchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't say for sure what was going on'' with him from 1991
to 1996 _ most of the years covered in the indictment _ one senior
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Present and former American officials and former business
associates of bin Laden say he appears to control only a fraction
of the $250 million fortune that the American government says he
possesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, his money's running out,'' said Frank Anderson, a
former senior CIA official who maintains close Middle Eastern
contacts.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Johnson, the State Department deputy counterterrorism
director from 1988 to 1993, said administration officials had
``tended to make Osama bin Laden sort of a Superman in Muslim garb
_ he's 10 feet tall, he's everywhere, he knows everything, he's got
lots of money and he can't be challenged.''
</P>
<P>
   Milton Bearden, a retired senior CIA official who ran the
agency's war in Afghanistan and retired in 1995, said the
government had ``created a North Star'' in bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is public enemy No. 1,'' Bearden said. ``We've got a $5
million reward out for his head. And now we have, with I'm not sure
what evidence, linked him to all of the terrorist acts of this year
_ of this decade, perhaps.''
</P>
<P>
   Political leaders in Sudan and Pakistan who have met bin Laden
describe him as intelligent, soft-spoken, polite. They also say he
is deadly serious about his violent brand of radical politics and
capable of killing in God's name.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden was born into the ruling class of Saudi Arabia. His
father was the favorite construction magnate of the Saudi royal
family, who gave bin Laden's family huge contracts to renovate the
holy cities of Mecca and Medina and build palaces for Saudi
princes.
</P>
<P>
   American officials calculated bin Laden's fortune by estimating
the family fortune at $5 billion and dividing by 20 _ the number of
male heirs. But business associates of bin Laden who spoke on the
condition of anonymity said his family cut him off years ago, and
are managing his share of his inheritance for him as long as he is
disowned. Business associates say bin Laden has been living on a
generous allowance from his eldest brother and that his assets in
Saudi Arabia are now frozen.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, at 22, bin Laden left Saudi Arabia and moved to the
Afghan frontier. In Peshawar, Pakistan, bin Laden _ working
alongside, but never directly allied with, the CIA _ used his money
and his machines to help the Afghan rebels fight the Soviet Army
invaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Afghan war shaped bin Laden, those who know him say. ``He is
an ordinary person who is very religious,'' said President Omar
Bashir of Sudan, who met bin Laden often between 1992 and 1996.
``He believes in the rule of Islam and where possible the
establishment of an Islamic state. The time that he spent in
Afghanistan led him to believe that this might be achieved through
military means.''
</P>
<P>
   Legend has it that bin Laden fought bravely against Soviet
troops. But former CIA officers say he was a financier, not a
warrior _ ``a philanthropist supporting a number of health care,
widows-and-orphans charity operations in Peshawar for Afghan
refugees,'' as Anderson put it.
</P>
<P>
   He also helped create a headquarters called Al Qaeda, the Base.
It was a way station in Peshawar where Egyptian and Saudi
volunteers rested before setting off for battle in Afghanistan. Its
name became a kind of flag uniting bin Laden's followers. American
officials call it a global terrorist network.
</P>
<P>
   When the Soviet forces left Afghanistan in 1989, bin Laden went
home to Saudi Arabia. He soon set his sights on the last remaining
superpower.
</P>
<P>
   ``He himself was very much wary about America,'' said Saad
al-Faqih, a Saudi exile living in London, who worked as a surgeon
for wounded Afghan fighters, ``very skeptical about America and the
Saudi regime.''
</P>
<P>
   He found a new enemy on Aug. 7, 1990, when the United States
began sending half a million soldiers to Saudi Arabia, preparing
for war against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the stories put out by bin Laden is that he went to
King Fahd and promised that he would raise holy warriors who would
protect Saudi Arabia,'' said Anderson, who was the chief of the
CIA's Near East operations in the mid-1990s. ``His violent
opposition to the Saudi royal family began when King Fahd denied or
rejected that offer.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To bin Laden, the deployment of Americans in the land of Mecca
and Medina smacked of the Crusades, the Christian religious wars
against Islam that began nine centuries ago. His rage transformed
him into a stateless outlaw.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1991, Saudi intelligence officers caught bin Laden
smuggling weapons from Yemen, his father's homeland. They withdrew
his passport. Soon afterward he made his way to Sudan, which had
decreed its borders open to all Muslims, with or without passports
or visas.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans of the Afghan jihad, or Holy War, against Moscow
followed bin Laden, under Al Qaeda's banner. But ``when Al Qaeda
was moved to Sudan, it lost around 70 percent of its members,''
Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, accused of being an associate of bin Laden,
said during an interrogation by German police after his arrest in
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``This group didn't have a purpose except to carry out the
jihad, and since nobody carried out the jihad, it lost a lot of its
members,'' Salim said.
</P>
<P>
   There were three kinds of men in Al Qaeda, he said. First,
``people who had no success in life, had nothing in their heads and
wanted to join just to keep from falling on their noses.'' Second,
``people who loved their religion but had no idea what their
religion really meant.'' And third, ``people who have nothing in
their heads but to fight and solve all the problems in the world
with battles.''
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden lived in Khartoum, the Sudanese capital, ``as an
investor,'' said Bashir. ``With his money, he was adventurous, and
probably he gained this mentality by his experiences as a
fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   The indictment against bin Laden says he provided training camps
in Sudan where Afghan war veterans prepared for terrorist missions.
But a senior American intelligence official flatly contradicted
that, saying, ``There was never a bin Laden-financed training camp
in Sudan.''
</P>
<P>
   The official added: ``In 1993, '94, '95, he's managing and
building up his legitimate business presence there in Sudan. I
won't pretend we've got a good intelligence base on this period,
but we think he was laying the groundwork for Al Qaeda.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 two CIA officers were stalked by teen-age followers of
bin Laden in the streets of Khartoum. ``Bin Laden was approached by
us and was told that this would not be tolerated,'' said Ghazi
Salaheldin, Sudanese information minister. Sudan expelled the
teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of such perceived threats _ though some were
mirages, based on a slew of false CIA reports _ the United States
withdrew from Sudan in late 1995. The absence of American diplomats
and spies in the country diminished Washington's ability to know
what bin Laden was doing at the very moment he stepped up his
political war.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, after the Saudi government rescinded his citizenship,
he began sending scathing attacks on the royal family from
Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bin Laden took a chance and started doing some political
activities,'' Bashir siad, ``not terrorist activities, but he
started issuing political bulletins and communiques and faxes,''
denouncing the Saudi government as corrupt and repressive.
</P>
<P>
   The United States took notice. ``There had been confusion''
after the World Trade Center bombing in 1993 about the nature of
radical Islamic threats to the United States, said Johnson, the
former senior counterterrorism official.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were lots of theories, not very good intelligence, and
so the intelligence community actually started generating a picture
that Osama bin Laden was, if you will, the new face of terrorism,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   On May 31, 1996, four Saudis were beheaded after confessing to
bombing a Saudi National Guard post in Riyadh and killing five
Americans. All told their interrogators that they had received bin
Laden's communiques. Only 25 days later, a truck bomb tore through
a military post in Dhahran, killing 19 American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden was blamed by American officials for instigating the
attacks. But no known evidence implicates him and the Saudi
interior minister, Prince Nayef ibn Abdel Aziz, has absolved him.
``Maybe there are people who adopt his ideas,'' he said. ``He does
not constitute any security problem to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the Dharhan attack, bin Laden and members of his
entourage left the Sudan in aC-130 military transport. The Sudanese
had asked him to leave _ at the request of the United States. Bin
Laden landed at an American-built airport in Kandahar, Afghanistan.
Three months later, on August 23, 1996, he declared war on the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation in Saudi Arabia is like a great volcano about to
erupt,'' his declaration stated. ``Everyone talks openly about
economic recession, high prices, debt'' and ``the filling up of the
prisons.''
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden's criticisms of Saudi repression and corruption
closely corresponded with State Department reports and CIA
analyses. They diverged by blaming the United States. ``The root of
the problem is the occupying American enemy, and all efforts should
focus on killing, fighting and destroying it,'' bin Laden
proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   A second, more ominous warning came on Feb. 23, 1998: ``To kill
Americans and their allies, both civil and military, is an
individual duty of every Muslim who is able, in any country where
this is possible,'' until American armies, ``shattered and
broken-winged, depart from all the lands of Islam.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came August's embassy bombings. American authorities say
the men who attacked the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were
controlled by bin Laden. But they still have no clear idea how.
</P>
<P>
   Despite efforts at the highest levels of the U.S. government,
bin Laden and his closest associates remain isolated in
Afghanistan, the nation he helped fight Soviet occupation in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to say precisely where the criminal case against
bin Laden stands. Prosecutors have obtained unusually restrictive
court orders that bar the defendants and their lawyers from
communicating with virtually anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, at least, the case has lost momentum. While two
suspected bombers were quickly apprehended, many other suspects are
still at large. The last arrest was more than six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now the hunt for bin Laden depends on whether the Taliban, his
radical hosts in Afghanistan, will betray him. The United States
has little leverage with the Taliban, and little fresh intelligence
on how to capture bin Laden. It has no spies in Afghanistan, and
little new information on precisely how he might have instigated
the deadly bombings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not have a clear picture yet of what happened when,''
said Prudence Bushnell, the U.S. ambassador to Kenya, who was
injured in the bomb blast, which killed 12 of her colleagues. ``I
may not ever have a clear picture of what happened when. None of us
may.''

MCDOUGAL ACQUITTED ON CHARGES OF OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE
</HEADLINE>
   (ac) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ A federal jury Monday acquitted Susan
McDougal of obstructing justice when she refused to testify before
a grand jury about the Arkansas financial dealings of President
Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton. But the jury, in its
third day of deliberations, deadlocked on two counts of criminal
contempt and the judge, George Howard Jr., declared a mistrial on
those charges.
</P>
<P>
   Although the jury's action was a mixed result, it amounted to a
setback for Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel for Whitewater
matters, who Mrs. McDougal argued was out to get the president.
Starr brought the criminal case against her after she had served 18
months in jail for civil contempt for resolutely refusing to
cooperate with his investigators and not answering questions put to
her on two occasions by a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors did not immediately say whether they would seek to
retry her on the two contempt counts, although Mark Barrett, the
principal trial prosecutor, said, ``That's definitely an option.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDougal exulted when the partial verdict was read and told
reporters later that she was especially elated because the trial
had given her an opportunity ``to tell the world what kind of man
Ken Starr is.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr issued a statement saying his office was ``obviously
taking this very seriously.'' Barrett, who said he had consulted
with Starr about a retrial, said the prosecutors would speak with
the jurors and that would weigh heavily in their decision.
</P>
<P>
   Two jurors interviewed after the trial said that the vote had
been 7 to 5 in favor of acquittal on the two contempt counts before
the jury told Howard that they were deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Geragos, Mrs. McDougal's lawyer, said the trial result
``put a stake through the heart of Ken Starr.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDougal's case is almost certainly the end of the Arkansas
phase of the Whitewater investigation, which began with a local
real estate venture involving the Clintons and spread to a range of
other issues, including the president's affair with Monica
Lewinsky, which led to a months-long impeachment battle.
</P>
<P>
   Like several of the cases brought by the independent counsel,
the trial of Mrs. McDougal was less about any wrongdoing uncovered
in the investigations than about a lack of cooperation with the
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDougal declared that she would not cooperate with any
grand jury associated with Starr because she did not trust him, and
that assertion apparently played a significant role in her
acquittal on the obstruction charge. Of the three counts she faced,
that was the only charge in which Howard instructed the jurors that
they could consider her state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Nance, a juror and Little Rock truck driver, told
reporters after the trial that ``everybody in America'' knows Mrs.
McDougal did not answer questions before the grand jury. ``The
issue was the state of her mind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDougal testified at the trial that she believed that
Starr and his associates had been bent on getting her to lie to
damage Clinton's chances for re-election in 1996. She said that her
former husband, James McDougal, who was then negotiating with
prosecutors, told her she could escape prosecution herself if she
concocted a story that she had once had a sexual affair with
Clinton. Prosecutors vigorously denied the charge, contending it
demonstrated Mrs. McDougal's flair for dramatic fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   The McDougals had been partners with the Clintons in the failed
Whitewater real estate development, and both McDougals were
convicted of fraud in May 1996 in connection with an illegally
obtained $300,000 loan to their ailing savings association, part of
which prosecutors thought had paid for Whitewater expenses. Clinton
testified he knew nothing of the loan. At her trial, Mrs. McDougal
answered the very same questions she had declined to answer before
the grand jury, saying that she knew of no wrongdoing by either
Bill or Hillary Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors, Barrett and Julie Myers, sought to present a
straightforward version of the case against Mrs. McDougal, arguing
that she had been given immunity from prosecution and was ordered
by a federal judge to answer the grand jury's questions.
</P>
<P>
   But Geragos mounted a vigorous attack on Starr and his
prosecutorial tactics. Over strong objections from prosecutors,
Howard allowed Geragos to call as witnesses several figures who
complained about how they had been treated by Starr and his fellow
prosecutors. One of those who testified, Julie Hiatt Steele, is
being prosecuted in Virginia for offering conflicting versions of
what she had been told by a friend, Kathleen Willey, who alleged
she was groped without her consent by the president in the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   But the jury was split on whether Starr and his prosecutors were
excessive or too zealous. ``The Office of the Independent Counsel
was not on trial here,'' said Nance, the juror, who wanted to
acquit Mrs. McDougal. His views were shared by the jury foreman,
Donald R. Thomas. Thomas, a factory supervisor, told reporters that
he did not believe the prosecution's tactics were an issue.
</P>
<P>
   But another juror, Charles Adams, a retired worker from Little
Rock, said in an interview that some of his fellow jurors ``just
hated the independent counsel.'' Adams, who thought Mrs. McDougal
guilty on all counts, said that at times it appeared that Starr was
on trial and that some jurors ``were just not going to give any
ammunition to them to help get the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Nance, who almost caused a mistrial Friday when he brought an
unauthorized law book into the jury room, said the deliberations
were often angry. When the judge questioned the jurors in open
court on Monday, nine of the 12 said they did not believe further
deliberations would produce a verdict on the two remaining counts.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee said Monday they were
considering asking Mrs. McDougal to come testify about the
independent counsel law, which is set to expire soon.
</P>
<P>
   Although Barrett, the prosecutor, left open the possibility of a
retrial, there are some factors that make it unlikely. The Starr
investigation is winding up and many of the lawyers like Barrett
have made plans to return to their former jobs. In addition to Ms.
Steele, the only other person scheduled to go on trial is Webster
Hubbell, a former associate attorney general and longtime Arkansas
friend of the Clintons who faces tax and fraud charges in two
separate trials.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDougal, who seemed to enjoy the trial even though she
faced a possible sentence of up to 27 months on each of the
charges, had a coterie of family and friends present during the
last five weeks and became a bit of a celebrity as she walked
around Little Rock, receiving good wishes, even from strangers who
regularly came up to her and almost always said they were tired of
Starr's investigation.

BOSTON TO HOST OLYMPIC CONGRESS IN 2002 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Boston has been awarded the rights to host the United States
Olympic Congress in 2002, the Massachusetts Sports Partnership and
the Greater Boston Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 of the most powerful sports leaders in the
country are scheduled to attend the meeting, including heads of the
national governing bodies of individual Olympic sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fairly small event in terms of the revenue the event
itself will produce, locally,'' said Lou Kovacs, the marketing
coordinator of the sports partnership. ``But, with all of the
various officials of all of the individual sports coming in, it is
going to be a real chance to show off Boston as a potential venue
for their championships and other events in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time the US Olympic Congress will meet in New
England, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The annual meeting consists of workshops and educational
sessions designed to encourage participation in the Olympics and to
instruct those representing the individual sports about how to
foster sponsorship and licensing relationships, officials said. It
includes an extensive exhibition in which companies display the
goods and services they offer to the Olympics and the sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably going to generate about $1.8 million locally,
considering we need space in three hotels and the fact that the
different groups and organizations will be in town for four or five
days,'' said Patrick B. Moscaritolo, president of the Boston
Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau. ``But, if in the process of showing a
lot of these people our town and the services we can offer for the
various events within their sports it leads to other events, it
could yield tens of millions of dollars, eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic Congress includes a youth program called Champions
In Life in which dozens of Olympians from New England will visit
local middle and high schools to promote sports, education and
Olympic ideals.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting will be among a series of Olympic-related events in
Boston over the next several years, said Soosie L. Lazenby,
president of the sports partnership, a private, nonprofit
corporation established in 1993 to further the development and
growth of sports in the area. Those events include the meeting of
the board of directors of the US Olympic Committee in 2000, the
2000 US Olympic Gymnastics Trials and the 2001 US Figure Skating
Championships.

YUGOSLAVS SEEK `UNION OF SLAVS,' INCLUDING RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Bombing Yugoslavia is one thing. But would NATO dare
take on an alliance armed to the teeth with nuclear weapons and the
latest in anti-aircraft missiles? Say, for example, one that
included Russia?
</P>
<P>
   That is the question Yugoslav lawmakers hoped to raise Monday as
they overwhelmingly voted to include their land in a loose ``Union
of Slavs'' with the former Soviet republics of Belarus and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians in Belarus, a mainly Slavic nation of 10 million
people with strongly anti-Western leaders, applauded the idea. The
same for Russia, a mainly Slavic nation with 6,600 nuclear warheads
and state-of-the-art S-300 anti-aircraft missiles. Neither nation,
however, has formally voted for union.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav supporters of the Slav alliance, proposed by President
Slobodan Milosevic last week, made no secret of the idea that
joining Russia and Belarus' loose confederation had one goal: to
stop the NATO airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our future is in the east, in the embrace of Mother Russia. We
are making this decision under the burden of bombs which has only
speeded it up,'' said Deputy Prime Minister Vojislav Seselj.
Seslelj has been stumping to ally Orthodox Christian Slavs for
years, an idea that used to mark him as a radical nationalist.
</P>
<P>
   In wartime, the idea appeals to other Serbs as well. Outside
parliament in Belgrade, a crowd of about 2,000 greeted Monday's
vote with cries of ``Serbia!'' ``Russia!'' ``Belarus!'' as the
country's leaders cheered what they sought to portray as the end of
Yugoslavia's isolation.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO, the United States and their satellites thought that
Yugoslavia would surrender and remain alone,'' Yugoslav Prime
Minister Momir Bulatovic told parliament after the vote. ``It
neither surrendered nor remained alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Dragan Tomic, the speaker of the parliament of Serbia:
``Yugoslavia has done its part of the job. Russia and Belarus are
now expected to do the same. We hope that will happen soon.''
</P>
<P>
   How soon a Slav union will happen depends partly on Russian
President Boris N. Yeltsin. The volatile Russian leader has given
contradictory signals, but Monday, Yeltsin's foreign minister, Igor
Ivanov, said Moscow ``looked favorably'' on the idea of a Slav
alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin and his government have strongly condemned NATO's
bombardment but have tried to avoid a total break with the West _
such as violating international sanctions against arms shipments to
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the domestic pressure on Yeltsin to take a tough stand
on Yugoslavia may have eased Monday, when the State Duma, the lower
house of parliament, postponed planned impeachment hearings that
had been due to start Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov said last week that a Slav union
would serve as a deterrent against NATO attacks because the US-led
alliance ``would never bomb our allies.''
</P>
<P>
   But for a threat to work, the other side has to perceive it that
way. NATO foreign ministers attending a meeting in Brussels Monday
barely flinched at the Slav union proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Air strikes will be pursued until President Milosevic accedes
to the demands of the international community,'' NATO responded in
a statement. Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright will likely
deliver that message Tuesday to Ivanov in Norway in the first
face-to-face US-Russian talks on Yugoslavia since Moscow suspended
ties with NATO to protest the airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice if the US believed in the westward expansion
of Moscow and Minsk,'' state Russian TV commented, almost
wistfully. ``That would end the war quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   But a Slav union is a tough sell to the outside world. Calls for
Slavic unity ignore NATO's support by Slav nations such as Poland,
Slovakia and the Czech Republic. Cries of Orthodox Christian
solidarity fail to account for Greece, an Orthodox Christian member
of NATO. Appeals to aid the ``brotherly Serbs'' forget that from
1948, when Yugoslav leader Jozip Broz Tito broke ties with Soviet
dictator Josef Stalin, until the mid-1980s, the Kremlin regarded
socialist Yugoslavia with the same suspicion as the democracies of
Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the idea of a union with Yugoslavia has many proponents
here in Russia, already disillusioned by the failure of market
reforms. NATO bombing has sparked anti-Western protests nationwide
here.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian parliament is dominated by people who view
Milosevic's iron rule and anti-Western defiance with nostalgia for
the days when the Soviet Union was like that. Both houses of the
Russian parliament have voted to ask the Kremlin to send arms to
Yugoslavia; both support a Slav union.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to help our Slavic brothers not only in word, but if
necessary with military equipment,'' said Communist Duma member
Sergei Reshulsky, a supporter of union with Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Critics wonder how even a loose confederation with Yugoslavia,
which has no common border with either Russia or Belarus and was
never part of the Soviet Union, would work. Thus far the
Russian-Belarus union has brought few tangible fruits, other than
giving Belarus' authoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenko, a
broad forum in Russia for his calls for the restoration of the
Soviet Union. Lukashenko Monday accepted Milosevic's invitation to
visit Belgrade soon.
</P>
<P>
   Some Russian commentators asked if it made sense to go along
with a deal that seems to force Russia closer to open confrontation
with the West at a time when Moscow is asking for the International
Monetary Fund to help restructure billions in foreign debts. ``If
we form a Union, that means that tomorrow we will have to wage war
against the US and the West, and that would be something Russia can
ill afford to do,'' said Vladimir Lysenko, a centrist Duma
lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   One recent survey of Russians said that although most Russians
condemn NATO attacks against Yugoslavia, only 24 percent want to
send Belgrade military aid. Nor was everyone in Yugoslavia happy
with the idea of a union with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Predrag Popovic, deputy speaker of legislator in the Yugoslav
republic of Montenegro, described the proposed union as Milosevic's
``last and desperate effort to save his power and the ideology of
which he is a slave.''

COMPAQ WILL FACE SALES QUESTIONS AT TRADE SHOW 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Compaq Computer Corp.'s Innovate trade show, which
starts Tuesday, was supposed to be a celebration of its new status
as fully grown computer company.
</P>
<P>
   But instead, its executives will face questions about depressed
sales and profits that sent Compaq's share price crashing Monday,
pulling other personal-computing stocks down with it.
</P>
<P>
   A warning issued Friday that its first-quarter profits would be
half what analysts were expecting is going to be an issue at the
biennial show expected to draw 4,500 high-level customers and 250
journalists to the George R. Brown Convention Center in downtown
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq's announcement was blamed for the Dow Jones Industrial
Average index plunging more than 77 points when the market opened
Monday, though it rebounded aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq's stock on Monday closed down 6 ~ _ or more than 22
percent _ to 24 1/16. The Dow rebounded, however, closing at at
10,330.51, up 165.67.
</P>
<P>
   During a pair of conference calls with analysts on Monday,
Compaq chief executive Eckhard Pfeiffer reiterated the reasons why
his company expects a less-than-stellar performance when final
earnings numbers are released on April 21.
</P>
<P>
   He said a combination of decreased demand for business PCs,
falling prices and customers opting for less-profitable products
will result in profits of about 15 cents a share on sales of $9.4
billion. Analysts had been expecting 32 cents a share on sales of
$9.7 billion to $9.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our preliminary results clearly did not meet our
expectations,'' Pfeiffer said.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer said during the call that Compaq is not the only
PC-maker being buffeted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been significant changes in the technology
marketplace, and all major PC suppliers have experienced them,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts disagreed, saying the issues appear to be confined
to Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone else is having a bad quarter,'' said
Michael Kwatinetz, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston in
New York. ``I follow Dell, Gateway, Apple, Hewlett-Packard and
Micron Electronics. All five are having decent quarters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a little surprised (at Pfeiffer's assertions) because
we are not seeing broad signs of a slowdown,'' said Andrew Neff, an
analyst with Bear, Stearns in New York.
</P>
<P>
   A large part of Compaq's problem is that the business PC market
is beginning to resemble the consumer arena. Businesses are
beginning to snap up lower-priced PCs that can easily handle the
same tasks as more expensive, state-of-the-art systems.
</P>
<P>
   But these lower-priced systems carry smaller profits. Even if
Compaq sells more of the cheaper products, it is not enough to make
up the difference in profits.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer said sales ``across the commercial sector'' have been
soft in North America; Europe has been slightly stronger. In
addition, intense competition has forced Compaq to keep prices low.
</P>
<P>
   Add to this the fact that first-quarter business PC sales are
traditionally slow.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeiffer also sought to kill speculation that recent moves by
Compaq to sell more computers directly to the public have hurt the
company's relationship with resellers, the middlemen who
traditionally have peddled Compaq's PCs to businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our relationship with the channel is excellent, let me say
that very loud and clear,'' Pfeiffer said.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq created an entire line of PCs just to be sold via the Web
and over the phone. The company sought to assuage resellers by
offering a bounty for each customer they sold.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Compaq expanded its direct-sales Prosignia line,
allowing customers to buy the machines in retail stores as well.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Hill with First Call, which monitors analyst ratings on
companies, said nine of 27 analysts contacted had cut their ratings
and earnings expectations on Compaq the year as well as the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are viewing this as a more-than-one-quarter problem,''
Hill said.``

KOSOVO NOT HIGH ON CONGRESS' AGENDA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nearly three weeks after NATO bombing of Yugoslavia
began, Congress is returnsing to work this week with no clear
agenda on how to deal with the conflict. Proposed resolutions are
being circulated that variously call for sending in ground troops
or withdrawing all funding for the operation, but no consensus has
emerged.
</P>
<P>
   And no votes are likely this week, both leaders of the House and
Senate signaled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not expect to have any votes regarding Kosovo this
week,'' House Speaker Dennis Hastert said in a statement Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott told GOP officials he did not
plan to open a floor debate on Kosovo this week.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, Hastert and two other congressional leaders from each
party met Monday night with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Before the meeting, a number of Democrats and Republicans urged
Clinton not to rule out the use of ground troops in Kosovo, which
some believe will be necessary to expel Serbian forces. Some
senators, including Democrats Edward M. Kennedy and John F. Kerry
of Massachusetts, said Monday that the option of ground troops
should be kept open in order to keep pressure on Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exit strategy is victory, which to me means the capacity
to have an autonomous and safe Kosovo,'' Kerry said. ``I am very
clear that it should never have been taken off the table as an
option. Hopefully it is something you should never have to use.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said from the start of the Kosovo conflict that it
would not be necessary to send ground troops to the region. Monday,
Defense Secretary William S. Cohen reiterated that position, saying
there was ``no need'' for ground troops, and that ``we would not
even consider it'' unless conditions change.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's actions in Kosovo may be increasing support in
Congress for ground troops. Senator Christopher Dodd, the
Connecticut Democrat, who just returned from a visit to refugee
camps over the border from Kosovo in Macedonia, said any doubts
about the operation were erased by his trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the message that we send in the next 48, 72 hours out
of this Congress on this issue, I think, could have a huge effect
on the outcome of this conflict,'' Dodd said. If Congress sends a
divided message, ``I think you extend this conflict a lot longer
than necessarily need be the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodd and others who support the possibility of ground troops
said they are concerned that ruling out such an option would tell
Milosevic he can remain in Kosovo as long as he is willing to
sustain the air attacks.
</P>
<P>
   But Senator Byron Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, said the
introduction of ground troops ``could be a very, very significant
mistake.'' He said, ``NATO allies have a special responsibility
especially in their neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo conflict has put many members of Congress in unusual
positions. For example, Kennedy and Kerry, who both initially
opposed the Persian Gulf War, are among a majority of senators who
last month backed airstrikes in Kosovo and now are urging that the
option of ground troops be kept open.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many Republicans who normally would be
considered hawks, including Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
voted last month to oppose airstrikes. Lott has since stayed mostly
quiet on the matter, not wanting to speak against the Kosovo action
while US troops are engaged in a battle overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate this week could begin debates over Kosovo, but the
format has not been set. The Senate, for example, could do
everything from voting on a ``sense of the Senate'' resolution to
approving a declaration of war, which hasn't been done since World
II.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is an appetite and desire to have some kind of
discussion about this,'' said Lott's spokesman, John Czwartacki.
``The question is what the vehicle is for that discussion to take
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, in his statement, said congressional committees will
hold hearings on Kosovo in the coming days. Furthermore, he said,
``at the end of this week, a senior delegation from the House will
fly to the region and further investigate the situation in Kosovo.
I have instructed this delegation to make report about the latest
situation in the Balkans upon their return.''

HANCOCK MAY MOVE UP DEMUTUALIZATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Encouraged by strong 1998 earnings and a stock market
that regularly hits record highs, John Hancock Mutual Life
Insurance Co. said Monday it would seek to speed up plans to
convert to a publicly traded company and sell shares to investors
in the first quarter of 2000, three months earlier than originally
targeted.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock, like other mutual insurers, is owned by its
policyholders, not stockholders. A host of other mutual insurers,
including giants Prudential Insurance Co. of America and
Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., are seeking to convert to publicly
traded companies _ a process known as demutualization _ to gain
access to capital and expand their business.
</P>
<P>
   Providing 1998 figures Monday at its annual shareholders meeting
in Boston, Hancock reported a 19.2 percent rise in net gain from
operations last year, to $627 million. Net gain from operations is
the statutory measure of operating profit for a mutual life
insurance company, and excludes realized capital gains and losses.
</P>
<P>
   Management surplus, or capital, rose 8.2 percent to a healthy
$4.7 billion, reflecting the firm's increasingly conservative
approach to its core insurance business. Capital is the amount of
extra funds available after all obligations to policyholders,
employees, and creditors have been met, and is a measure of a
firm's financial strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Hancock continues to experience excellent growth and
profitability,'' chief executive Stephen L. Brown said in a
statement. ``We had superior financial results, solid growth in
assets, and our ratings of financial quality continue to be among
the highest in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown told shareholders that the company tentatively planned to
go public in the first three months of next year, Hancock spokesman
Brian Carmichael said. The state Division of Insurance, which
regulates mutual insurance companies, must approve the company's
demutualization plan.
</P>
<P>
   An insurance industry analyst who requested anonymity speculated
that Hancock might be speeding up its plans as a result of the
strong stock market and a favorable environment for initial public
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock, the state's largest insurer, saw assets under
management rise 10.2 percent last year to $124.4 billion. Retail
sales of life and long-term insurance, mutual funds, and annuities
_ accounting for over half of Hancock's business _ rose 9 percent
to $680 million.

<P>
   TIRANA, Albania _ As the debate about committing ground troops
to Yugoslavia continues, the American military already has a
sizable presence here, backed by a fleet of Sea Dragon helicopters
and tons of equipment with more on the way.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly 500 American military personnel here are, for the
time being, dedicated primarily to delivering aid to refugees.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday morning, American soldiers manned the gates to Rinas
Airport, Albania's most important airfield. U.S. Air Force
personnel have also taken almost complete charge of the airport's
air-traffic control tower following last week's vote by the
Albanian Parliament to effectively surrender control of Albanian
airspace and military bases to the allied forces.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, Belgium, NATO officials said there was no intention
of introducing ground troops into Yugoslavia, but they warned
Yugoslavia against attempting to widen the conflict by provoking
other countries.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Albania's president, Rexhep Meidani, accused the
Yugoslavs of trying to widen the scope of the fighting by attacking
a northern Albanian village over the weekend. Two Albanian
civilians were killed and eight others wounded; a man identified as
a French reporter was also wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Meidani vowed to ``resist all types of provocation'' and to
continue supporting the NATO allies in every way possible.
</P>
<P>
   That includes allowing the U.S. Air Force to install
sophisticated navigational and guidance systems and to station
troops at the Rinas Airport, which handles both commercial and
military operations.
</P>
<P>
   The equipment allowed the airstrip to be used in the dark for
the first time overnight Sunday. Big C-17s and other cargo planes
are landing on average every hour throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   American military officials say their primary mission is to
provide relief supplies to the hundreds of thousands of Kosovo
refugees in remote camps in Albania. But advance teams from the
U.S. Army were beginning to work on preparations to receive 24
Apache helicopters. They are expected to fly missions against
Yugoslav forces, either from a portion of the airport, or from a
nearby location, officers said.
</P>
<P>
   Deployment of the Apaches has been delayed by the primitive
conditions of the Albanian airstrips. Establishing fueling,
maintenance and security services for the Apaches and their support
crews are the Army advance team's immediate focus, said Air Force
Maj. Thomas Dolney, a military spokesman at Rinas Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The airport, on the outskirts of Tirana, is so badly rundown and
ill equipped that when the first relief supplies and military
equipment arrived here more than two weeks ago, there was not one
working forklift available to help unload the aircraft that brought
them. The airstrip was built between the First and Second World
Wars, and was extended by Italian occupation forces.
</P>
<P>
   During the long period of Albania's isolation after World War
II, when most Albanians were not allowed to leave the country and
few outsiders were permitted to enter, the airport was used
primarily by the longtime dictator, Enver Hoxha, to greet communist
dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the American troops, 150 French military personnel,
and troops from Greece, Turkey and Italy, appear to be working
together at Rinas Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot more multinational cooperation than I've seen on
other missions,'' said Chief Warrant Officer Steven Weagle, a
25-year veteran now with the Sea Dragon team from the minesweeper
USS Inchon, anchored in the Adriatic Sea. ``Everybody's fired up
about being involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gregory Geisen of the Navy's 6th Fleet headquarters said the
addition Monday of 10 heavy-duty MH-53E Sea Dragon helicopters had
significantly increased the ability to lift food, blankets and
other relief supplies to hard-pressed refugee camps like those at
Kukes, in northern Albania.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The helicopters can carry up to 16 tons of equipment and can
make several trips daily.
</P>
<P>
   That will relieve some of the pressure on the French forces,
which have been providing the bulk of the transportation of relief
supplies until now. In all, the relief supplies are being
transported by 11 different organizations, including the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   While American troops tried to erect their tents near muddy
fields Monday, the dusty Rinas airstrip was covered with pallets of
blankets, high nutrition drinks and sacks of wheat. The deliveries
are being coordinated by the U.N. high commissioner for refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian Parliament voted last week to offer the NATO allies
control of the airspace over the nation to coordinate relief and
military efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the widest possible expression of support,'' said
Mentor Nazarko, an assistant to Meidani.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian troops remain at Rinas Airport, but mostly are involved
in controlling traffic at the entrance gate and assisting in
handling security.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working in cooperation with the Albanians,'' said
Dolney, of the Air Force, ``but the U.S. controls the airspace.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, a French commando team on a rescue mission landed
two Puma helicopters in a remote area of northern Albania where
members of the Kosovo Liberation Army are believed to have set up
camp. The commandos were responding to the reports about the French
reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Guillaume de Saint-Bon said the helicopters, carrying
three doctors and 10 commandos, landed near a soccer stadium in
Bajram Curri, the provincial capital of the Tropoja region in
northern Albania, near the border with Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian officials said that Yugoslav forces fired mortar rounds
and used automatic weapons against a group of border policemen and
Albanian civilians at a remote border crossing, the latest in a
series of such incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Two Albanians died when their car was hit with a mortar shell,
an Albanian official said. Eight others were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian government said it had evacuated civilians from the
area where the skirmish took place. Albania will respond to further
aggression by the Yugoslavs, said Nazarko, of the Albanian
president's office, but will not cross the border into Yugoslav
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. de Saint-Bon did not know the identity of the man who was
said to be a French reporter, but said the man's thigh bone had
been shattered by a bullet. The man was flown back to Rinas Airport
Monday morning, where he was transferred to an ambulance and taken
to a local hospital.

PULITZERS AWARDED FOR 83RD TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Hartford Courant took top honors for its coverage of a
deadly shooting spree at lottery headquarters, and The New York
Times' Maureen Dowd won for her sharp-elbowed commentary on
``Monica-gate'' when the 83d annual Pulitzer Prizes were announced
at Columbia University in New York Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Three news organizations each captured two of the 14 Pulitzers
awarded in the journalism categories. Also at the Times, the news
staff, with Jeff Gerth singled out, won in national reporting for
articles on the sale of American techonology to China, pushing its
total number of Pulitzers to 79. (The Boston Globe is owned by The
New York Times Co.)
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street Journal garnered the international reporting
prize for its coverage of the Russian financial crisis, and the
Journal's Angelo B. Henderson took the feature writing Pulitzer for
his portrait of a man driven to violence after being a crime victim
himself. The Associated Press captured Pulitzers in the spot news
and feature photography categories for its photographs of the
embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania and for a collection of
pictures capturing the yearlong White House impeachment scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Pulitzer winners in the letters and drama categories included
Michael Cunningham's ``The Hours'' in the fiction category;
Margaret Edson's play ``Wit'' _ performed last summer at the
Shakespeare and Company in Lenox _ in the drama category; and A.
Scott Berg's ``Lindbergh'' in the biography category. A special
citation was awarded to the late jazz great Edward Kennedy ``Duke''
Ellington, commemorating the centennial year of his birth.
</P>
<P>
   The Courant's breaking news stories on the Connecticut Lottery
massacre in March 1998 in which a gunman killed four coworkers and
then himself, earned the paper its second ever Pulitzer. The story
broke only a month after new editor Brian Toolan took over the
reigns in the newsroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good on behalf of the pros who made it happen,'' said
a celebratory Toolan Monday. ``We at least attempted to to put
answers'' to the lottery tragedy. ``Our narrative approach on how
it happened was exceptional.''
</P>
<P>
   A victorious Dowd _ who helped transform Beltway and New York
Times journalism with her character-based dissections of the
nation's leading politicians _ told the Associated Press Monday,
``My reaction is I'm just so grateful to President Clinton that he
never spoke the words, `Young lady, pull down that jacket and get
back to the typing pool.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Several other leading newspapers also took home Pulitzers
Monday. The Washington Post won in the public service category
(which earns the winner a gold medal instead of the usual $5,000
prize) for a series that examined careless gunplay by municipal
police officers. Chuck Philips and Michael A. Hiltzik of the Los
Angeles Times took beat reporting honors for stories on corruption
in the entertainment industry. And Blair Kamin of the Chicago
Tribune won for criticism for his coverage of Chicago's
architecture, with particular emphasis on the city's famous
lakefront.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Herald earned the Pulitzer in investigative reporting
for unearthing the pervasive voter fraud in a city mayoral election
that was eventually overturned. The (Portland) Oregonian's Richard
Read won a Pulitzer in explanatory reporting for his profile of a
local french fry exporter that illustrated the domestic impact of
the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The editorial board of the (N.Y.) Daily News won in the
editorial writing category for its campaign to rescue the
threatened Apollo Theatre landmark. And the editorial cartooning
winner was David Horsey of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
</P>
<P>
   Although The Hartford Courant was the only New England winner,
four Boston entries also made it to the finals of the journalistic
Pulitzer competition. The Boston Globe earned three finalist spots.
Delores Kong's and Robert Whitaker's work disclosing how
psychiatric researchers callously performed drug experiments on
mentally ill patients was a finalist in public service. Globe book
critic Gail Caldwell was a finalist in criticism. And Globe
photographer Bill Greene's images reflecting the work of Donald
Anderson, who helps the residents of poor Southern communities
improve their lives, earned him a finalist designation in feature
photography. Clay Bennett, of The Christian Science Monitor, was a
finalist in editorial cartooning.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the letters and drama competition, Edwin G. Burrows
and Mike Wallace won the history award for ``Gotham: A History of
New York City to 1898'' while the general nonfiction prize was
given to John McPhee for his book ``Annals of the Former World.''
Mark Strand's ``Blizzard of One'' took top honors in the poetry
competition, and the Pulitzer for music was awarded to Melinda
Wagner for ``Concerto for Flute, Strings and Percussion'' which was
premiered last May by the Westchester Philharmonic in Purchase,
N.Y.

   GRDELICA, Yugoslavia _ No one knew the names of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   They were not locals, just strangers passing through on the
Belgrade to Skopje train, No. 393, at about 11:45 Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   They were unlucky, it seems, to be in this particularly
spectacular gorge, on this particular bridge, in this particular
train, at this particular time, when death dropped down unseen from
a cloudy sky.
</P>
<P>
   In its expanding air war, NATO planes Monday morning bombed two
bridges _ one highway, one railway _ over the Juzna Morava River.
The train, five cars pulled by a bright red, white and blue engine,
was on the railway bridge, a narrow structure of steel girders
painted a dull gray. The missile cut the train in half.
</P>
<P>
   At least nine people were killed, said police at the scene, and
at least 16 others, badly wounded, were brought to a hospital in
nearby Leskovac. At least two planes were heard, according to a
police sergeant who would not give his name, but they could not be
seen above the clouds. He said that the bridge was hit and then the
train itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now go away,'' he said through a translator. ``I don't want to
hear English anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said in Brussels Monday that the alliance had
targeted the bridges here, some 190 miles south of Belgrade, on
what it considers an important supply route into Kosovo. But the
deaths they put down to another accident of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no intent to hit the train,'' said NATO spokesman
Jamie P. Shea. ``Regrettably, we cannot exclude the possibility of
casualties in this instance.''
</P>
<P>
   The casualties were not hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   Three railway cars were incinerated, still hot and smoking three
hours later, when the first journalists arrived.
</P>
<P>
   On the grassy verge next to the tracks, close to a small plowed
field turning green and a street of damaged houses, nine charred
and broken corpses lay heaped by a small tree. Their clothes had
been blown or burned away.
</P>
<P>
   Police and army officers had begun to arrive in groups to direct
traffic, get the earthmovers working on a makeshift detour around
the holed highway bridge and to keep the curious away.
</P>
<P>
   Three men wearing transparent plastic gloves walked up to the
grassy verge with a cheap coffin, pale knotty wood on the inside,
the outside stained a not very convincing darker brown.
</P>
<P>
   One man, in blue overalls, picked up a female torso, from the
neck to the buttocks, and placed it into the coffin. He then bent
down and lightly tossed a blackened arm into the coffin, picking up
his head to stare at the smoldering cars, the rushing river below
and the steep hills, dotted with spring greenery and flowering
fruit trees.
</P>
<P>
   The smell of spring was strong, lush and damp, quickly overtaken
by that of burning oil, rubber and electrical wire. Then, like the
top note of a perfume, the melancholy, sweet, cloying smell of
burned human flesh.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our life now _ spring and death,'' said Nenad Pezo, the
Yugoslav Army minder who had allowed a car of journalists to make a
detour and come here.
</P>
<P>
   A man watching from the narrow road at first refused to talk.
Then he began to throw words like stones. ``Another atrocity,'' he
said. ``Or do the NATO criminals think atrocities are not
atrocities from the air?'' Asked his name, he spit on the ground.
Goran, he said, then turned away.
</P>
<P>
   The journalists had come from the scene of another NATO
accident, in the little Kosovo village of Merdare, near Mirovace,
about 1.5 miles northwest of Podujevo, near the provincial border
with Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   This is Kosovo, but no official here would discuss the military
situation. Any brief discussion of the condition of the ethnic
Albanians here or the tactics of the Serbian military toward them
was either bland or tendentious.
</P>
<P>
   On the road south there were numerous checkpoints, guards on
bridges and a heavy troop presence on a cloudy day, both on foot
and in trucks. But there was little armor visible. Sometimes one
could hear planes, but not see them.
</P>
<P>
   Deeper in Kosovo, where journalists are not allowed to wander,
there are continuing, consistent reports of Serb atrocities against
ethnic Albanian supporters of the Kosovo Liberation Army. But we
were brought here by the Yugoslav authorities to witness Serb
suffering.
</P>
<P>
   In Merdare, NATO bombs and anti-personnel bombs demolished four
houses in the early hours of Sunday morning, killing five people,
including Bozina Tosovic, 30 years old, and his 11-month-old
daughter, Bojana. His wife, Marija, six months pregnant, is in the
hospital, along with the four members of the Markovic family:
Dragan and his wife Natalija and their two children, daughter
Andelija and son Milos.
</P>
<P>
   Markovic's brother, Ljubomir, 42, had just arrived an hour
before from Belgrade, where he lives, and walked in shock around
the blasted houses and stables. He had heard about the attack on
television, and then the local police phoned him.
</P>
<P>
   In the collapsed remains of his brother's house, of mud brick
and wood, with what had been a red tile roof, he found the family
dog, Snoopy, a yellow mongrel, with half his snout blown away.
</P>
<P>
   Ljubomir began to sob, kneeling by the quivering dog, petting
his head, as sunlight poured through a huge hole in the roof. ``Are
you scared my doll?'' he asked. ``Are you scared, sweetheart?''
</P>
<P>
   He looked up, tears streaming. ``Should I shoot him? I can't.''
He then stood to gather some family photos blown through the rubble
of the children's bedroom, the mud and wood roof and exterior wall
collapsed on their beds. ``Can you imagine passing through this?''
he asked. A broken mirror had a row of stamps pasted on it
featuring soccer stars, sponsored by Sony.
</P>
<P>
   He turned back to the dog, then said: ``Ten years. For 10 years
it was impossible to find two socks and two shoes together because
of that Snoopy.''

 GRDELICA: that Snoopy.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the fields, there were hundreds of small holes in the earth
from detonations, and small green nylon parachutes from what
appeared to be NATO anti-personnel bombs, covering an area of about
300 square yards. Large pieces of green painted metal, with yellow
stripes, perfectly broken open as if on a seam, lay about the yard.
There were also large pieces of formed yellow styrofoam and light
aluminium containers, with fans like whirligigs, that appeared to
have held the small parachutes, with explosives attached.
</P>
<P>
   There was one dead pig and another wounded, and shrapnel
everywhere. Trees were broken off and flung 20 yards. A child's
pillow with cartoon characters, mice and cats, lay in the mud.
</P>
<P>
   Markovic pulled at an elbow. ``The cow is dead but the calf is
alive, but he's wounded,'' he said, staring. ``Should I shoot the
calf?''
</P>
<P>
   In the ruined stable, a massive black and white cow lay dead
across the door. Markovic stepped on it to reach the brown calf,
its tail nearly severed and its breath labored. ``It won't move
from its mother,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He came out and appealed to a policeman, who talked softly to
him but only shrugged. ``I don't believe there is any comment on
this,'' Markovic said. ``I care more about this cow and calf and
dog than Clinton and Albright care about anyone in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Miloje Smiljkovic, described as a local detective, in plain
clothes and two days' growth of beard, pointed out the sights.
``There is no military objective here that anyone can think of,''
he said. ``Maybe they're trying to cut off Kosovo from Serbia.''
The attacks came just after midnight on Orthodox Easter Sunday, and
again at 2 a.m. and 4:25 a.m., he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also possible that the planes were going after
Yugoslav army troops or a column of vehicles on the nearby road,
which might explain the use of the anti-personnel munitions.
</P>
<P>
   Dragan Bubalo was another of the dead, killed in his Ford
Sierra, which was blasted off the paved road. The dark blue car,
shot through with holes from shrapnel and its hood blown 60 yards
away, had run into an earth embankment. The metal road sign marking
the village of Merdare was also full of shrapnel holes.
</P>
<P>
   On a second hill, three large craters, about 10 yards deep, had
destroyed the house, barn, car and tractor of Milutin Veskovic, an
actor at a local theater called Zajecar, who was not home when the
bombs hit. The plastic tray of a box of chocolates landed 150 yards
away. Socks hung weirdly from the branches of the broken trees.
</P>
<P>
   His neighbor, Ognjen Bercovic, came along, an old man leaning on
a stick. ``We heard the planes, then the bombs,'' he said. ``There
was a huge light, a flash.'' Asked how his family is, he began to
cry. ``The kids are so terrified,'' he said, describing his
grandson, 2 years old, and his 15-day-old grandaughter, Marina.
``They're still shaking,'' he said, then attacked the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their bombs will not scare us,'' he shouted, still weeping.
``No man will frighten us.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Tosovic house, neighbors and some soldiers were trying to
salvage what they could: a ripped couch, a television set, plates
and glasses. A thin man, a neighbor, was asked about the family. He
became incensed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't talk to Americans or Brits,'' he said tightly. ``I
won't talk to them. I don't want to look at them. I'm sorry,'' he
said, ``but please just go away.''

 &HT;    Home Depot builds e-commerce presence
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Home Depot is nearly ready to test two new business
ventures, including a long-anticipated shot at electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based retailer is revamping its Web site to handle
online sales as early as this summer, said Marshall Day, senior
vice president of finance and accounting. A new version of Home
Depot's Web page, which will feature more interactive elements,
will launch next month, Day said Monday at Robinson-Humphrey Co.'s
28th Institutional Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The conference, which continues today and half-day Wednesday,
features executives of more than 170 companies who discuss the
challenges and strategies of their businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot won't say what products it will sell online.
Maintenance Warehouse, the company's mail-order subsidiary that
sells plumbing, lighting and hardware to owners of office buildings
and apartments, will process orders. Day indicated that the company
is still working out pricing issues.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Villager's Hardware, the company's smaller
convenience concept, will open its first store in June in East
Brunswick, N.J. Aiming at the small-project customer who wants to
avoid the sprawling warehouse stores, the new format is less than
half the size of a Home Depot. Two more stores will open in the
next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Villager's Hardware will overlap less with Home Depot than
originally planned, Day said. For example, the stores will carry
small appliances, as well as more cleaning and storage products
than Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   New stores are driving most of Home Depot's sales and earning
growth. Home Depot expects to continue to increase its store count
by at least 21 percent annually. By the end of 2002, the company
will have 1,600 stores, more than double its current size.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot's recent expansion of proprietary brands is helping
to drive sales at existing stores. The Ridgid tool brand, launched
last year, has been a success, Day said, and six new products will
hit stores later this year. A new line of General Electric water
heaters is also being rolled out. The company is betting on
continued growth by courting the contractor market.

AT NATO MEETING, FOREIGN MINISTERS VOW TO KEEP THE PRESSURE UP
</HEADLINE>
   (ac) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO's foreign ministers pledged Monday to
keep up the air attacks against Yugoslavia but at the same time
searched for the shape of a political settlement in Kosovo and
urged Russia to be part of it.
</P>
<P>
   At the first gathering of the 19 ministers since the bombing
began, the allies joined in reaffirming their basic demands of
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, stating that he must
withdraw his forces from Kosovo, allow Albanian refugees back and
permit the stationing of an international military presence.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the show of solidarity, there did not appear to be
any concrete plan or method to achieve those ends, save an effort
to bring Moscow in to serve as a bridge between the alliance and
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who
is attending the gathering, said that there was no agreement among
the allies on the form Kosovo would take but that ``some kind of an
international protective status'' was the most common thread in all
of the ideas.
</P>
<P>
   On the fighting front, as NATO maintained the military pressure
against Yugoslavia, Serbian authorities said that a NATO missile
hit a passenger train on Monday in southeastern Serbia, killing at
least nine people and badly injuring 16 others. At NATO
headquarters, a spokesman said ``we cannot dismiss the reports of
casualties,'' but that they could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   As for the refugees, a NATO spokesman said allied military
planners have been asked to come up with ways of air-dropping
supplies to an estimated 260,000 ethnic Albanians believed to be
stranded in Kosovo after being evicted from their homes by Serb
forces. So far, air drops have been ruled out because of the danger
of Serb ground fire aimed at pilots flying at low altitudes, and
the chance of supplies falling into Serb hands.
</P>
<P>
   Washington officials said last week that a total of up to
700,000 Albanians were believed to be displaced inside Kosovo and
that their lack of food was of growing concern.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these people, still at great risk from Serbian forces,
were believed to have found temporary accommodation with relatives.
But even for those with some shelter, food shortages were alarming,
the administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In northern Albania and in Macedonia, officials said that the
dismal physical conditions for the estimated 500,000 Albanians
expelled from Kosovo were beginning to improve as more tents, food
and other supplies were flown in from Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the effort to draw the Russians into the NATO
diplomatic effort, Albright is scheduled to meet with Russian
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov in Oslo on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   French President Jacques Chirac spoke by telephone on Monday to
the Russian president, Boris Yeltsin, and said afterwards he was
encouraged by the Yeltsin's ``positive'' attitude.
</P>
<P>
   In another diplomatic effort, the U.N. secretary-general, Kofi
Annan, who backed NATO's demands against Milosevic last week, was
expected to join European Union leaders on Wednesday for a meeting
about Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said in New York on Monday that he was prepared to meet
with Milosevic if it would help resolve the conflict. At a press
conference at U.N. headquarters, Annan said he had written to the
Yugoslav leader on Saturday to underscore the five-point appeal he
issued the day earlier, which, among other things, calls on
Yugoslavia to stop at once its ``campaign of intimidation and
expulsion of the civilian population'' from Kosovo and to permit
``refugees to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My good offices are available in any situation,'' Annan said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said they welcomed the entrance
of Annan onto the Kosovo stage. A third party in addition to the
United States and NATO would almost certainly be needed when the
time came to deal with Milosevic, they said.
</P>
<P>
   In talks with Albright on Monday, the Greek foreign minister,
George Papandreou, offered to try and arrange with the Belgrade
authorities for food to be shipped across the borders of Macedonia,
Albania and Montenegro into Kosovo, a Greek government official
said. A non-governmental Greek agency was still operating inside
Kosovo and could be a conduit for the supplies, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing some kind of ``international protective'' status
for Kosovo, the foreign ministers had clearly moved beyond that
peace proposal fashioned in Rambouillet. It called for an
autonomous Kosovo within Serbia, a NATO-led force of 28,000
soldiers and the disarming of the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overtaken by events,'' was how Albright referred to elements
of the agreement that she spent days crafting in the French town of
Rambouillet.
</P>
<P>
   That accord, signed by the ethnic Albanians but not the Serbs,
called for about 5000 Serb police and Yugoslav soldiers to be
stationed in and around Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, Albright said that for the 500,000 ethnic
Albanian refugees to return to Kosovo as the allies demanded, all
Serb and Yugoslav forces would have to leave.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees would not return to Kosovo if they were vulnerable
to being ``terrorized'' by the very forces that had expelled them,
she said.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   France and Germany stressed on Monday that they wanted U.N.
involvement, or at least endorsement, of any plan for post-conflict
Kosovo. On this point, the French foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine,
was unambiguous.
</P>
<P>
   For a political settlement in Kosovo to be acceptable, the U.N.
Security Council would have to be involved, Vedrine said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because this is a matter of the principles that govern
international relations, the whole of the international community
should be involved and first of all the United Nations Security
Council,'' he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, was less adamant
about the Security Council's involvement but said that a mandate
from the United Nations for any security force that entered Kosovo
was ``desirable.''
</P>
<P>
   One question that remained unresolved centered around under what
conditions would prevail in Kosovo for the international security
force to enter the province.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has talked of a ``permissive environment'' for the
security force, which NATO officials repeated on Monday would be
NATO-led.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials have said that the security
force, which would be responsible for ensuring the return of the
refugees, would not fight its way in against Serb troops. These
officials have also said that ``permissive'' meant the consent of
the government in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   When asked at a news conference what ``permissive'' meant, the
secretary-general of NATO, Javier Solana, said, ``Why don't you
help me a little and not ask me to define the word permissive.''
</P>
<P>
   While the foreign ministers appeared impressed with themselves
for the unity they had maintained behind the bombing campaign, they
did not rule out more unpleasant surprises from Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   In the communique issued after their meeting, the 19 ministers
warned that they were concerned that Milosevic may try to unseat
the government of Montenegro, which after Serbia is the smaller of
the two republics in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The president of Montenegro, Milo Djukanovic, an opponent of
Milosevic, is supported by the West although NATO has bombed
targets in Montenegro in its efforts to break up the Yugoslav Army.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Milosevic sacked high ranking generals in
Montenegro and replaced them with his loyalists, a prelude to a
possible coup d'etat attempt against Djukanovic. Monday's
communique said that Milosevic ``should be in no doubt that any
move against President Djukanovic and his government will have
grave consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   A leader of the Kosovo Liberation Army, Jakup Krasniqi, who was
a member of the ethnic Albanian delegation at the peace talks at
Rambouillet, was present at NATO headquarters Monday and met with
foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
   He had a private meeting with Albright where he thanked the
secretary for the NATO campaign, a State Department official said.
He also asked that the ethnic Albanian refugees now in Albania,
Macedonia and Montenegro be kept as close as possible to Kosovo
rather than being flown to Europe or the United States, as
originally proposed.
</P>
<P>
   A Clinton administration official said that Washington still
stood behind the proposal in the Rambouillet accord that the Kosovo
Liberation Army had to be disarmed once an international security
force established itself in Kosovo.

 &HT;    Braves ruin Phillies home opener, win 8-6
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Ah, Opening Day in Philly.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies home opener at Veterans Stadium came complete with
the ``Rocket Man'' shooting around the outfield with a jet pack on
his back before the game, a hang-glider sweeping down to home
plate, and a fourth inning slug fest in the center field stands.
</P>
<P>
   It caught on.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the Braves 8-6 win, it was a slug fest on the
field too.
</P>
<P>
   After the Braves and Phillies exchanged three-run innings, they
brought out the big sticks. Bret Boone went first with a two-run
home run in the seventh, his first as an Atlanta Brave to put the
Braves up 6-4. Then came Alex Arias and Scott Rolen for the
Phillies who each belted solo home runs to left field off Mike
Cather to tie it 6-6 in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Javy Lopez was the last man deep, driving a line drive home run
to center field for his first home run of the season, a two-run
job, for an 8-6 lead in the eighth inning and the eventual winning
runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the right time for me to do something,'' said Lopez,
who drove a 2-1 fastball to center for his first hit of the day.
``We're tied in the eighth inning. I was 0 for 3. I found the pitch
I was looking for and I didn't waste it.''
</P>
<P>
   Buried under the pile of runs were starters John Smoltz and
Carlton Loewer, the same two guys who five days ago dueled to a 4-0
Braves win. Smoltz didn't feel that far off but made a couple bad
pitches in the second inning. That was enough to leave him holding
four earned runs, the most he's allowed since last August 21
against San Diego, eight regular season starts ago.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Smoltz was extremely nasty. He struck out eight,
matching his total from his first start of the season.
</P>
<P>
   After coasting through the first inning, Smoltz loaded up the
bases without recording an out to start the second. A strikeout of
Mike Lieberthal and a 2-2 count on Desi Relaford made it look like
Smoltz was on his way out of the woods. Right about that time
Relaford connected for a triple to the right field corner, scoring
all three base runners to give the Phillies a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned a pretty good lesson today about pitch selection
with the bases loaded and the pitcher on deck,'' said Smoltz, who
hung a changeup to Relaford. ``You don't want to get beat with your
fourth pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz started a three-run rally of his own with his first hit
of the year on a line drive to right field. He was followed by
back-to-back run scoring doubles to the gap in left center by Otis
Nixon and Boone. Brian Jordan completed the rally with an RBI
single past second baseman Marlon Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones had another frustrating outing on Monday. He went
0 for 5, lowering his season average to .206. But he had a good
time watching the multiple fights that broke out in the center
field seats during the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will say this,'' Jones declared. ``They made more contact
than I did.''

CHINESE OFFICIALS FRUSTRATED BY ADMINISTRATION'S WAVERING ON TRADE
DEAL
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ When President Clinton visited China last summer, he
and China's top leader, Jiang Zemin, held a press conference
broadcast live around China in which they discussed every sensitive
issue in U.S.-China relations, from Tibet to allegations of illegal
Chinese donations to American political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, some fellow Chinese leaders considered it perhaps
the biggest risk Jiang had taken in the decade since he assumed
Chinas top political titles, an unprecedented concession to demands
for more political openness. The Chinese public had never before
seen live broadcasts of a U.S. president, much less one debating
head-to-head with his media-shy Chinese counterpart. The
risk-taking paid off when Clinton's visit was judged a success by
both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Just 10 months later, Prime Minister Zhu Rongji has complained
at every stop on his six-city tour of the United States that
Clinton ``does not dare'' to take what he considers to be a much
smaller political risk: allowing China to join the World Trade
Organization under terms that even Clinton's own trade negotiators
considered a slam dunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know our American counterparts very well. We have been
negotiating this agreement for 13 years,'' said senior Chinese
official traveling with Zhu who had close involvement in the talks.
``When you are doing these things for so long, you know when you
have a deal. We had a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials accompanying Zhu on his visit pointed to this
asymmetry _ Jiang taking the gamble of his political life, Clinton
overruling his own staff _ as an illustration of what they see as
endless frustration in their dealings with the United States. Yes,
they say, democracies work differently from dictatorships, but that
does not justify what they perceive as Clinton's intolerable
fickleness.
</P>
<P>
   The frustration has built even as officials gush about Zhu's
visit to America. The prime minister has shown that he can stand
face to face with the best American politicians and argue
persuasively for his views, they say. He might even succeeded in
rallying public support for China's entry into the trade
organization, though some Chinese officials have been known to
overestimate the political influence that business leaders have.
</P>
<P>
   That confidence was in evidence on Monday when 1,500
businessmen, including chief executives of Motorola, United
Airlines, Bank One and a dozen other companies based in the
Midwest, gathered at a Chicago banquet for Zhu. With the prime
minister seated at the podium, several chief executives vowed their
support for China's entry as Zhu nodded in appreciation. Commerce
Secretary William Daley, in town for the occasion, also assured Zhu
that China's admission ``is not a question of if, but when.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials also reacted favorably to word that some 100
businessmen showed up for a White House briefing on China trade
talks on Monday. Several executives who attended complained that
the Clinton administration misread both public and congressional
sentiment when it scuttled the deal with China, according to
participants.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Galvin, Motorola's chief executive, said that
support for China's entry into the WTO has gelled enough during
Zhu's visit that he wishes the prime minister had visited
Washington at the end of his nine-day stay instead of at the
beginning. ``Then we might have a deal,'' Galvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such optimism, the damage from Clinton's wavering may
run deep. One of Zhu's top aides, likely reflecting the views of
other pro-Western officials in China's political hierarchy, said
Clinton's role in the trade talks was not unlike his decision in
1995 to allow Lee Teng-Hui, the president of Taiwan, to visit the
United States. Lee attended a graduation ceremony at Cornell
University, his alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as now, Congress appeared to make China policy instead of
the White House, said this aide, who declined to be identified
further. Then, as now, Clinton intervened at the last moment and
overturned an approach that had the firm backing of his China
experts.
</P>
<P>
   China considers Taiwan a rebellious province, not a sovereign
country, and Clinton's decision to authorize Lee's visit set off
the worst confrontation between the United States and China since
relations were normalized in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton's memory is short,'' this Chinese official said. ``Our
memory is longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that while China's foreign policy puts
relations with the United States at the top of the agenda, the
United States juggles many international priorities. It is no
coincidence, one Chinese official said, that Clinton rejected a
trade deal as the United States led the NATO assault on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration insists that China is a high
priority. But Chinese officials doubt that. The administration, for
example, has so far failed to find a suitable replacement from its
ambassador to China, James Sasser, who has made his intention of
leaving that post known for months.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The war in Yugoslavia is also a direct affront to the two major
pillars of China's foreign policy, peace and noninterference in the
internal affairs of sovereign countries. Where the United States
sees a severe humanitarian crisis, China sees the threat of foreign
intervention in Taiwan and Tibet, its own restive regions.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the biggest worry, at least among Zhu's aides, is
their fear that the Clinton administration did not appreciate the
delicate nature of the process that produced China's revised bid to
join the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   China has sought entry to the trade body for 13 years, but it
has really made only two strong pushes for membership. The first
came in 1994, when the WTO was born of its predecessor, known as
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The application then
came amid a rush of economic reforms. Chinese officials made GATT
the symbol of its modernization drive, only to have the United
States block entry.
</P>
<P>
   China's interest in joining the trade body, which requires
demolition of tariffs and trade barriers that shield many
inefficient sectors of its economy from outside competition, faded
in the intervening years. It was fully revived only late last year.
Then, Zhu, newly appointed prime minister, made entry into the
trade organization his personal mission.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese trade officials said that never before had a senior
Chinese leader taken an interest in the details of negotiations the
way Zhu did.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you don't have a senior leader involved in the details,
then the negotiators cannot get instructions,'' said a trade
official. ``Without Zhu, it would never have been smooth.''
</P>
<P>
   Crucially, the push to join the trade body became the symbol of
a new stage in China's reform program. Economic reforms previously
focused on agriculture and manufacturing industries. But the new
drive aimed at opening the country's undeveloped service sector _
telecommunications, banking, consulting, accounting, entertainment
and many other areas _ to both domestic and foreign competition.
</P>
<P>
   With the Asian financial crisis dragging down growth in China
and the country flooded with over-investment in unproductive
industries, the opening of services was seen as one of the few ways
to promote quality economic growth. The trade organization offered
a framework to change myriad internal Chinese rules and regulations
that keep services off limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Service sector reform and the WTO are the same thing for
China,'' said this trade official. ``We won't get one without the
other.''
</P>
<P>
   China could still get both if negotiations pick up where they
left off before Clinton pulled the plug. But the Chinese side,
while publicly indicating continued support for a deal, privately
frets that restoring momentum will be tricky.
</P>
<P>
   There are no more scheduled visits of Chinese or American senior
leaders. The Clinton administration, which the Chinese already view
as weak, may see its remaining clout to push a trade deal through
Congress only diminish as Clinton approaches the end of his term.
And, perhaps most worrying for the Chinese, trade was supposed to
be the unbreakable bond between the two countries that keeps them
talking even when military, diplomatic and human rights concerns
strain ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trade is the one area where our two interests are really in
line,'' the Chinese trade negotiator said. ``So if we don't even
agree on trade, the outlook is not so good.''

 &HT;    Courage in Cabbagetown
 &HT;    (EDS: Corrects spelling of Sims and Moseley.)
 &HT;    By Jay Bookman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It must be solitary work _ sitting in a crane all day
hundreds of feet above a construction site, your only contact with
your fellow man coming from disembodied voices carried into your
cab by radio. But that day-to-day routine could not have prepared
Ivers Sims for what happened to him Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Because for many long minutes yesterday, Simms looked more alone
than any man alive.
</P>
<P>
   A massive fire had broken out at one of the buildings in the
19th-century Fulton Bag and Cotton Mill, where Simms was running a
construction crane. The other workers had fled, but Simms could not
escape his 250-foot tower. Below him, a blood-red inferno belched
black, poisonous smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to escape the heat and the smoke, Simms scrambled as far
from the fire as possible, until he ran out of crane and could go
no farther. Hundreds of people watched helplessly from the ground
below; many thousands more watched in horror on television. The
flames would die down briefly, then erupt skyward as if trying to
snatch Simms from his lonely perch.
</P>
<P>
   And below, the fire was blackening the white steel crane.
</P>
<P>
   Already, however, hundreds of people were scrambling to help. A
small police helicopter flew close enough to offer him the only aid
it could give at the moment, which was reassurance that he had not
been abandoned. A larger helicopter from the state Department of
Natural Resources arrived at the scene prepared for a rescue
attempt. Its pilot, a DNR veteran, was Boyd Clines, and he was
assisted by Larry Rogers. Matt Moseley, a firefighter from the city
of Atlanta, volunteered to dangle from the chopper in a rope
harness, land on the crane and then strap in the beleaguered Simms
for rescue.
</P>
<P>
   The heat and smoke were not the only dangers. A fire that hot
creates its own wind _ strong updrafts that can easily slap a
helicopter around. The DNR crew had prepared for work in forest
fires and for extracting hikers injured in narrow mountain gorges,
but this would be something new.
</P>
<P>
   And they pulled it off perfectly. What had seemed to be a
heart-rending tragedy in the making, with a human life almost
literally hanging in the balance, was transformed by the courage of
well-trained men and women willing to risk their lives for others.
</P>
<P>
   The fire will be a terrible setback for Cabbagetown, a
long-neglected part of Atlanta that had only recently begun a
revival. The cotton mill was on the National Register of Historic
Places, and the nine-building complex was in the midst of a
renovation into more than 500,000 square feet of loft apartments,
offices and other space.
</P>
<P>
   However, more than half of the renovation project has been
completed and is already occupied, and those buildings survived the
fire unscathed. The neighborhood itself _ a mix of urban pioneers
and hardy longtime residents _ is too tough to accept this setback.
For inspiration in their rebuilding, they need only look back at
Monday's events.
</P>
<P>
   Because as lonely as he looked out there on that crane, Ivers
Simms wasn't alone at all.

ORGANS-AZ (Phoenix) - A bill going through the Arizona Legislature
would require all Arizona organs to remain in Arizona. It's
considered a pre-emptive strike against the Clinton
administration's plan to donate organs to those who need them the
most. The bill is setting off a battle among doctors, ethicists and
patients on how to ration the nation's scarcest medical resources.

MONTINI-COLUMN (Phoenix) - The many people who've rallied around
cancer survivor Cameron Schmidt _ his family, his friends, his
classmates, thousands of strangers _ are wrong. There's only one
way to describe a brave, determined 18-year-old who's being
discriminated against by idiot pencil-pushers: Lucky. There's only
one word to characterize the parents of a young man who beat back

CAR-FREE IN SANTA BARBARA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Note use of italics throughout) 
 
  
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The tension crawls up the back of your neck like a
reptile.
</P>
<P>
   Why was the freeway so crowded at (ITALICS begin)this(ITALICS
END) hour of the day? And now, on this surface street, what was
that guy thinking when he shot across two lanes of traffic and
turned right, smack in front of me, without signaling? And why are
we crawling now? If we don't pick it up, that light's going to ch
... argh, too late.
</P>
<P>
   Time spent in a vehicle in Los Angeles can be a progressively
debilitating experience. The aggravation seems to mount in direct
proportion to the number of minutes spent behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, run the risk of compounding the condition during
precious time off, when the need to unwind on an out-of-town escape
is deemed acute?
</P>
<P>
   Thus, an objective was defined recently. A day trip would be
undertaken to Santa Barbara ... and the car would be left behind.
Transport would be conducted almost entirely by rail, trolley and
foot.
</P>
<P>
   It proved to be an unqualified success.
</P>
<P>
   The trip up and down the coast was pleasantly restful, almost
conducive to snoozing, and getting around Santa Barbara was a snap.
A trolley tour took the bite out of the relentless, uphill climb to
the mission, and the walk back down yielded unexpected delights.
(Isn't it remarkable how much more detail and nuance you can
experience when you're on foot?) Dining was an unhurried pleasure _
whether at an outdoor patio on a Santa Barbara side street or in
the dining car of the Coast Starlight just after sunset.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, the rejuvenation achieved from a day in one of
California's most charming coastal towns was intact upon returning
home. It wasn't sapped away in a sea of brake lights on a crawl
down the 101.
</P>
<P>
   Divine intervention probably had a great deal to do with the
success of the getaway, however. There's no other way to account
for a 12-hour period in which not one but two Amtrak trains ran
fairly close to schedule.
</P>
<P>
   This rail operation is propped up by the federal government, and
at times the experience of riding it is akin to awaiting an
important document sent by the DMV through the post office. Horror
stories abound _ trains that run hours late, conflicting
information from rail officials, a great number of blank
expressions and apathetic shrugs, and a preponderance of sentences
that include the words ``appreciate'' and ``patience.''
</P>
<P>
   All was rail-smooth on this recent weekday, though, and the
experience restored hope for future car-free escapes.
</P>
<P>
   The northbound San Diegan features a midmorning departure (8:50
a.m. on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, 9 a.m. on weekdays) from
Union Station with arrival in Santa Barbara around 11:30 a.m. A
second option is the Coast Starlight, bound for Seattle, which
leaves L.A. at 9:30 a.m. daily and pulls into Santa Barbara just
after noon.
</P>
<P>
   The northbound San Diegans also stop in Glendale, Burbank, Van
Nuys and Simi Valley, but a departure from Union Station is worth
the visit just to experience the historic structure, which stands
on the eastern edge of downtown Los Angeles, presiding over the 800
North block of Alameda Street. It was built in 1939, and whenever a
filmmaker is trying to reach back in time (``The Way We Were,''
``Bugsy''), you can count on a scene being shot here. The soaring
ceilings and ornate design recall an era when judicious use of
space wasn't such a pressing priority.
</P>
<P>
   The train rolled out of the station only 10 minutes late _ an
encouraging development _ and began its intriguing tour of L.A.'s
back yard.
</P>
<P>
   For those accustomed to air travel, the initial experience on a
train is always a bit startling. The amount of leg room is
phenomenal; it would be the envy of even a first-class air
passenger. The windows are enormous. There are no seat belts. And
after taking on passengers at a stop, the train resumes its journey
even with people roaming the aisles _ oblivious to whether tray
tables are stowed or seats are in their full, upright and locked
position.
</P>
<P>
   Most people bring along something to read on a train, only to
find themselves mesmerized by the passing scene. The train bounces
and jaunts along reassuringly, sounding its whistle at crossings.
</P>
<P>
   Rail travel also affords a perverse pleasure for those escaping
the car-bound existence of L.A.: At all those crossings along the
north edge of the San Fernando Valley, the cars are forced to wait
as (ITALICS BEGIN)we(ITALICS END) go sailing past.
</P>
<P>
   In the cafe car on this day, Steve Patterson and Lew Garber were
hunched at a table over a yellow legal pad, a laptop and the
contents of their briefcases. Businessmen from San Diego and Orange
counties, they said they were on their way to meet with clients
over lunch in Santa Barbara, and they were using the rail ride to
go over their notes _ something that wouldn't have been possible in
an automobile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's four hours from Santa Barbara to Oceanside (by train) if
we take the 3:49 home,'' said Patterson. ``At that time of the day,
it's going to take me four hours to drive it anyway. We drove it
when we were up here a month ago, and I got home drowsy, tired,
irritable. My wife said, `Hi, honey.' I said (grumpily), `What's
for dinner.'''
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy to keep your mind on your work when the train gets
just north of Ventura, however. That's when the tracks hug the
beach, affording sweeping views of the ocean and the Channel
Islands.
</P>
<P>
   But this is also where one of those uniquely Amtrakian
experiences occurred. The train rolled to a stop in the middle of
nowhere. No station in sight. Nothing on the schedule. No
explanation over the public-address system. It just sat there
motionless for several minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Conductor Peter McNamara later gave an explanation that came as
no surprise to veteran train travelers: We had sat on a side track
to make room for a southbound train. But it would have been nice if
that information could have been provided unsolicited via
public-address announcement.
</P>
<P>
   As the train resumed its pace, it offered views of surfers
shivering in the waves off Carpinteria, then passed the
lottery-dream homes of Montecito. If you looked out the windows on
the right, you might be demoralized by the sight of cars on the 101
traveling twice the speed of this diesel locomotive. But why fret?
Those people behind the wheel, while making better time, had to pay
attention to what they were doing. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Seeing the sights
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Barbara train station couldn't be positioned more
strategically for a day trip. It sits at the base of Santa
Barbara's picturesque main drag, State Street, and just four short
blocks from Stearns Wharf and the ocean. It's also just steps from
the Enterprise Fish Co. restaurant at 225 State, an ideal spot to
begin a Santa Barbara visit with a satisfying lunch.
</P>
<P>
   The cavernous building is a former laundry, and it presents a
Cannery Row-like ambience, with bare red-brick walls and sunlight
streaming through the clerestory windows high overhead. This place
embodies California casual: wood floor, no tablecloths, servers
clad in T-shirts, shorts and tennis shoes. A giant mesquite grill
commands the room, and it is kept busy _ six fresh-fish entrees are
available on this day, all priced under $11. The menu also features
nine varieties of draft beer and eight wines by the glass (Santa
Barbara County offerings abound).
</P>
<P>
   Outside, little electric trolleys periodically roll by. Their
destination is downtown; the fare is 25 cents for any ride of any
duration. But the objective on this day is to get to the Santa
Barbara Mission high in the foothills of the Santa Ynez Mountains,
then wander back through the city's picturesque neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   To get there without walking, the best bet is to stroll to
Stearns Wharf and catch a Santa Barbara Trolley Co. tour, a bargain
at $5 per person. It leaves here every 90 minutes starting at 10
a.m. (the 1 p.m. trolley is the best after-lunch option for train
travelers). You'll get a guided tour that swings down the coast
through Montecito's tony village, loops around the stately
Biltmore, returns to State and climbs to the mission.
</P>
<P>
   The ride is open-air and pleasant. About the only drawback on
this trip was the diction of the driver. He mumbled through his
familiar spiel, often at breakneck speed, in the manner of Jeff
Spicoli on a megadose of caffeine. Pity any foreign travelers with
halting English skills.

Los Angeles: with halting English skills. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Also, the choice of attractions was at times dubious. The
trolley slowed to a crawl by a beachfront estate in Montecito.
``Cheryl Tiegs lives here,'' came the tour commentary. (My, I'll
bet she appreciates that.) And on a side street in downtown, the
guide pointed out a grassy area on the right. ``See that pile of
wood there? That's where they filmed a movie last week. I can't
remember the name of it.'' Unbeknownst to the passengers gazing to
the right, Santa Barbara's historic Casa de la Guerra _ built in
the early 19th century by the settlement's presidio commandante _
was passing by on the left. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Spanish charm
</P>
<P>
   At the Santa Barbara Mission, the trolley stops for 15 minutes.
If you want to spend more time at this venerable edifice, simply
wait 90 minutes for the next one to come along. The plan on this
day, however, was to walk the 3{ miles back to the waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   It's a rewarding course. Santa Barbara adopted strict building
codes in the wake of a 1925 earthquake that reduced much of the
community to rubble, and its residential neighborhoods feature a
preponderance of Spanish, mission revival and craftsman
architecture. You don't have to worry about a lot of postwar stucco
boxes blighting the area. And you won't find any of the overbuilt
monstrosities found on postage-stamp lots in so many of L.A.'s
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Yards and gardens are often bordered by tall, thick hedges or
whitewashed walls with cascading bursts of bougainvillea. Palm
trees line the streets, and citrus trees, birds of paradise,
geraniums and hibiscus flourish in this coastal climate. The route
is pedestrian-friendly; nearly every street is bordered by a
sidewalk and parkway.One suggested stop on the way back is Alice
Keck Park Memorial Gardens, which take up a city block bound by
Arrellaga, Micheltorena, Santa Barbara and Garden. Here, you'll
find a tranquil spot to rest on a bench along a winding walkway. A
substantial lily pond at the center of the park is gorged with
enormous koi fish, while the rocks at the water's edge are often
crowded with turtles sunning themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Another must stop on the return walk is the Court House
observation deck (corner of Anapamu and Anacapa). An elevator takes
you most of the way up before dumping you off at a Quasimodo-like
stairwell. The reward at the top will threaten to take your breath
away.
</P>
<P>
   Here, there is a 360-degree view of the city and its setting:
the ocean, the mountains, the tree-shaded neighborhoods, the sea of
red-tile roofs downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Upon returning to the center of town, there are plenty of places
to rest the legs and slake a thirst. Santa Barbara's preoccupation
with the Spanish motif has seen to that _ there are patios, plazas,
fountains, courts and sidewalk sitting areas everywhere. For an
option off State Street's well-worn path, however, try the Paradise
Cafe, one block away at the corner of Anacapa and Ortega. It has a
comfortable patio area screened by greenery and plenty of
refreshment and snacking options.
</P>
<P>
   On this Tuesday, there was a further reward in Santa Barbara: a
bustling farmers market. Two blocks of State Street were closed to
vehicles to accommodate it, and numerous merchants _ most of whom
employ organic farming methods _ offered everything from white
asparagas to brown eggs to local wildflower honey to something
labeled pea sprout pesto. (The market is held 8:30 a.m. to 12:30
p.m. Saturdays, 4 to 7:30 p.m. Tuesdays.)
</P>
<P>
   At last, it was time to return to the train station _ or at
least the cluster of trailers next to it. The station is being
restored to its original 1905 form (which, remarkably, won't
conflict with Santa Barbara's design standards) and is targeted for
completion in July.
</P>
<P>
   But something was terribly amiss here. At 6 p.m., the Coast
Starlight came chugging into the station from the north. It was
(ITALICS BEGIN)early(ITALICS END).
</P>
<P>
   Even the conductor on the morning train had agreed that this
southbound train had gained great notoriety for its chronic
tardiness. It is one variable on this trip that can quickly
substitute for any car-related stress that you've managed to shed.
</P>
<P>
   When a passenger train falls behind schedule, for whatever
reason, it loses its track priority, and often must move onto side
tracks and sit idle for interminable periods to make way for
slow-moving freights.
</P>
<P>
   On a visit to Santa Barbara a year or so ago, the Coast
Starlight was running more than three hours late, such that Amtrak
had to arrange for a bus to carry the 6:17 passengers back to
points south. One problem, though: A station loudspeaker
announcement said the bus would be leaving shortly from the parking
lot. Passengers waited. And waited. They went inside and inquired
about the bus, only to be told, ``Oh. It already left. When I made
that announcement, I didn't know that my co-worker had already
released the bus.''
</P>
<P>
   Two travelers that day, unwilling to wait until 10 p.m. or so
for a train ride home, wound up taking a taxi to the Santa Barbara
Airport, renting a car, driving to the Glendale station to collect
their own car, then caravaning to Burbank Airport to drop off the
rental. This added considerable aggravation _ and expense _ to the
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, at 11:45, curiosity prompted the travelers to
call Amtrak's automated train-update service. The Coast Starlight
was in Oxnard. At 12:15 a.m., a subsequent call was placed. The
Coast Starlight was in Klamath Falls, Ore. Huh? Ah, of course: New
day, new train, and the previous day's passengers had vanished into
some nether region of Amtrak's computer.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, you don't have to cast your
fate with the Coast Starlight. A San Diegan train travels the
route, leaving Santa Barbara at 6:39 p.m. with a scheduled return
to Union Station at 9:30.
</P>
<P>
   On weekdays, one way to reduce the risk of aggravation is to
book on the day's last scheduled southbound San Diegan, at 3:49
p.m., but this does not allow for much of a day in Santa Barbara.
</P>
<P>
   On this particular day, however, everything was working smoothly
for the Coast Starlight. The train left on schedule (unfortunately,
that meant we missed seeing the sun set into the ocean by about 10
minutes), and soon last call was given for the dining car.
</P>
<P>
   On its long-range trains, Amtrak has a reputation for serving
food that can best be characterized as microwave medley, so it was
natural to brace for the worst. But this dinner on rails was a
pleasant surprise. Two of the entrees, a cheese tortellini in pesto
cream sauce and a baked chicken breast stuffed with mozzarella,
both served with snow peas and a green salad, were very good. And
with the Pacific Ocean whizzing by the window, the setting was
tough to beat.
</P>
<P>
   Seating at dining car tables is communal, a jarring diversion
from our insular urban lives, but it's a nice way to make
acquaintances with other train travelers. Across the table was an
eighth-grade science teacher from Hawaii who is kind of a glutton
for this mode of transport. Last year, she traveled the rails from
San Francisco to Washington, D.C., then north along the Eastern
Seaboard to Maine, before returning through the northern plains.
</P>
<P>
   Across the aisle, meanwhile, were three codgers discussing other
rail journeys past. Long past. One recalled the days when
professional baseball teams traveled by train, and was recounting
the nonstop high jinks and hazing of rookies in the Pullman
sleeping cars.
</P>
<P>
   Following dinner, one of the dining car stewards, Henry Ford,
cheerfully led two passengers on a tour of the first-class lounge _
normally off-limits to all but sleeping-car clientele. If you've
elected to be sequestered on a train for days on end, assigned to
one of the closetlike sleeping compartments, this might take the
edge off the claustrophobia: plush chairs for reading or gazing out
the window, and a downstairs theater for video movies on a large
screen.
</P>
<P>
   The train glided on through the night. It passed over the same
stretch of track in Glendale on which Fred MacMurray can be seen
disposing of Barbara Stanwyck's husband in the 1944 classic
``Double Indemnity.'' Wonder if they show that one in the
first-class theater.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled arrival time back in Los Angeles: 9:15 p.m. Actual
arrival: 8:52 p.m. Remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   After fetching the car (parking: $6 maximum per day), it was
assumed the drive home would be a breeze, but what's this? The
Harbor Freeway clogged solid? At (ITALICS BEGIN)this(ITALICS END)
hour. Time to opt for a surface street. This ought to do it, if
that light just stays gree... argh!
</P>
<P>
   Oh, to be back on the train _ or on a trolley or on foot _ in
Santa Barbara. &QL;

SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER'S DAVID HORSEY WINS CARTOONING
PULITZER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELLIS E. CONKLIN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Seattle Post-Intelligencer's David Horsey won the 1999
Pulitzer Prize for Distinguished Editorial Cartoons Monday in the
nation's most prestigious journalism contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I had a very strong year _ thanks largely to Bill
Clinton and Monica Lewinsky,'' the 47-year-old Horsey said with a
smile. ``There have been a group of very talented cartoonists who
have been doing this for years. Others were extremely deserving,
but I'm glad it's me.''
</P>
<P>
   The P-I newsroom erupted into cheers and applause as a beaming
Horsey came in to share the celebration with his colleagues. There
were handshakes and hugs all around. Bottles of California
champagne were uncorked in preparation for the congratulatory
toasts. Some of the bubbly found its way onto Horsey's mane of red
hair.
</P>
<P>
   The award marked the P-I's first Pulitzer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is tremendous news for David and the
Post-Intelligencer,'' said P-I Publisher and Editor J.D. Alexander.
``He deserves it. In a year when it was a great time to draw, he
knocked out everyone in the country. David had a hell of a year.
</P>
<P>
   Said P-I Managing Editor Ken Bunting: ``I am enormously proud
for the Post-Intelligencer, and extremely proud and happy for
David, who is a tremendous talent and deserving of this
recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   Editorial page editor Joann Byrd joked that Horsey, after
winning the Pulitzer, came to her to demand a raise and asked that
his cartoons from now on always run full page in size.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I didn't mind a bit,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Horsey left his vacationing family in Barra de Navidad, a small
Mexican city south of Puerta Vallarta, to fly back to Seattle on
Sunday to await word from the Pulitzer committee. The weeklong
getaway had been planned months ago, long before Horsey became
aware that he was one of three finalists for the prize.
</P>
<P>
   Since there was no phone at the home he was renting, Horsey made
sure to carry a cell phone so he could share the news with his wife
of 22 years, Nole Ann.
</P>
<P>
   Horsey plans to return to Mexico today to complete his vacation
with his wife and two children, Darielle and Daniel.
</P>
<P>
   A nationally syndicated editorial cartoonist and columnist,
Horsey's work appears in more than 450 newspapers. Earlier this
year, the National Press Foundation named Horsey Cartoonist of the
Year for 1998, honoring him with the prestigious Berryman Award for
Editorial Cartooning.
</P>
<P>
   The regional Society of Professional Journalists recently picked
Horsey to receive the 1999 Susan Hutchison Bosch Award for
outstanding achievement in journalism.
</P>
<P>
   George B. Irish, president of Hearst Newspapers and vice
president of The Hearst Corp., which owns the P-I, said the honor
``calls attention to Hearst Newspapers' long-standing commitment to
producing `journalism of distinction.'''
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, Seattle Mayor Paul Schell said he was thrilled
to hear the news. ``Not only is Horsey a great cartoonist, he's an
excellent writer as well in his occasional published pieces,''
Schell said. ``I've been a big fan of his for years. He's
terrific.''
</P>
<P>
   Horsey, the only full-time editorial cartoonist working for a
Seattle daily newspaper, is well regarded for his quick wit,
effervescent personality and his penchant for skewering the
powerful.
</P>
<P>
   As P-I reporter Scott Sunde put it, ``David goes after more
sacred cows than a love-sick bull.''
</P>
<P>
   A Pulitzer finalist in the the late 1980s, Horsey submitted 20
of his editorial cartoons for this year's judging. Many of them
lampooned the Clinton sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Horsey's favorite, and the one he believes might have drawn the
most critical acclaim from the judges, was titled ``Beltway
Apocalypse.'' The full-page cartoon that Horsey inked in the style
of a Renaissance painting ran on the cover of the Feb. 22, 1998,
Sunday P-I Focus section and portrayed the full montage of
characters involved in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Horsey said it's difficult to describe how he goes about
crafting a stand out editorial cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It starts with what's in the news,'' he said. ``And I do a lot
of reading so I can respond to some event with some intelligence.
But how it all comes together, I can't really explain it. I just
hope it keeps happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Horsey said his passion for drawing began as a child. But it was
at the University of Washington, where he earned his bachelor's
degree in communications in 1976, that he realized he might have
some real talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in a weight training class and I drew this rude
caricature of the instructor,'' Horsey recalled. ``He didn't get
mad like I expected him too. Instead, he said that I ought to work
for the UW Daily.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Evansville, Ind., Horsey has lived in Seattle since
1954. He was an honor student at Ingraham High School. Before
joining the P-I in 1979, he worked briefly at the weekly Sammamish
Valley News before joining the Journal American in Bellevue, where
he covered the state legislature as a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Horsey's work for the P-I has taken him to national political
party conventions, on the campaign trail during presidential
primaries, the Olympics, Japan and Europe. In 1993, Horsey was one
of only 25 Americans chosen to take part in the European Community
Visitorship Program in Brussels. More recently, he completed a year
at Hearst Newspapers' Washington Bureau where he took a closer look
at Congress and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   He has published four collections of his cartoons, the most
recent titled ``The Fall of Man'' in 1994. Horsey is now putting
the finishing touches on his first novel, ``Beyond the Border,'' a
story set in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   About a half-hour before the Pulitzer announcements were made,
Horsey remained at his desk in the third-floor graphics department
in the P-I building. He admitted he was nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to keep him loose,'' said Horsey's colleague
Duane Hoffmann.
</P>
<P>
   Just after noon, Horsey and a swarm of P-I editors gathered
around Alexander's desk waiting for The Associated Press to file
the story. The atmosphere was quiet and tense. Then the phone rang.
It was for Horsey. The caller was Laura Parker, a former P-I
reporter, now at USA Today in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean?'' Horsey replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won. You know that,'' Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   A minute later, the report came over the wire. Everyone cheered.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters and editors in the newsroom, Horsey said:
``I'm a nice guy, but I'm no more talented than anyone of you. It
takes all of us to put out a good newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Said P-I senior correspondent Andrew Schneider, a two-time
Pulitzer Prize winner: ``David graciously acknowledged the truth _
that Pultizer's are not won by a single person, but from a team
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander echoed that sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This award for David's work gives further recognition to the
Post-Intelligencer's enormously creative staff,'' he said. ``His
colleagues and I are proud of David's Pulitzer Prize, and I am very
proud of all of them as well for the splendid journalism they
provide each day to our readers.''

   CLINTON-CONTEMPT (Washington) _ Judge Webber Wright finds
President Clinton in civil contempt for his lies in the Paula Jones
civil deposition. She wrote: ``It is difficult to construe the
president's sworn statements ... as anything other than a willful
refusal to obey this court's discovery orders.'' The judge said,
``The record demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the
president responded to plaintiffs' questions by giving false,
misleading and evasive answers that were designed to obstruct the
judicial process.'' By John M. Broder.

   MCDOUGAL-TRIAL (Little Rock, Ark.) _ A federal jury today
acquitted Susan H. McDougal of obstructing justice for her refusal
to testify before a grand jury about the Arkansas financial
dealings of President Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
But the jury, in its third day of deliberations, deadlocked on two
other counts of criminal contempt and the judge, George Howard Jr.,
declared a mistrial. Although the jury's action was a mixed result,
it amounted to a setback for Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel
for Whitewater matters who Ms. McDougal claimed was out to get

in cooperation with the PBS program Frontline, has found him to be

CLINTON VISITS AIR CREWS INVOLVED IN KOSOVO CAMPAIGN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHREVEPORT, La. _ President Clinton on Monday praised the work
of air crews and support personnel involved in the NATO air
campaign against Yugoslavia as he stressed the alliance's
determination to end the violence in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are determined to continue the mission and we will prevail
because of you and people like you,'' Clinton told crews of B-52
bombers and A-10 attack planes as he visited Barksdale Air Force
Base. They have flown missions over Bosnia and will be headed back
to the Balkans in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   He said NATO ``would like to nip this conflict in the bud before
it destabilizes Europe'' and he warned Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic that he ``should be under no illusions that we will end
it from weariness.''
</P>
<P>
   Relating what he called the ``horrifying'' stories of atrocities
committed by Serb forces in Kosovo, Clinton said American and
allied personnel involved in the air campaign are ``trying to get
people to live in human terms so that people will not be called
upon to fight a wider war caused by someone else's madness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The stories we're hearing now are truly horrifying,'' Clinton
said of Milosevic's effort to rid Kosovo of its predominantly
ethnic Albanian population.
</P>
<P>
   Reciting accounts of mass killings, villages burned and looted,
Clinton accused the Yugoslav dictator of ``seeking literally to
erase the presence of these people in their own land.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We must not let that happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the 20th day of the bombing, Clinton flew to the home base of
some of the B-52s and A-10s involved in the allied operation to
show his support for the crews and families attached to the 8th Air
Force's 2nd Bomb Wing and 917th Air Reserve Wing, both of which
have deployed planes and personnel in Europe to participate in
Operation Allied Force.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton was meeting privately with some crews just
returned from flying missions over Yugoslavia, Defense Secretary
William Cohen was playing down the possibility of deploying ground
troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no consensus for ground troops in the NATO alliance.
There's no consensus for it in Congress or in the country at this
point. And there's no need for it,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen also said that NATO airstrikes against Yugoslav military
targets ``will accelerate'' in the coming days. ``We are now
determined to grind his military forces down.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen added that there will be no negotiations with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Citing intelligence sources, Cohen pointed to growing evidence
that Milosevic's forces are beginning to fall apart under the
steady and intense bombing campaign waged by the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   He said many of the Yugoslav military and police units operating
in Kosovo have been cut off from their command structures. He cited
instances of declining morale among Yugoslav troops and some
desertions, although he offered no details.
</P>
<P>
   Upon his return to Washington on Monday, Clinton met with
congressional leaders to make his case for continuing the air
campaign and once again to stress that he does not believe ground
troops will be necessary to help drive Milosevic's forces from
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has committed about 500 planes to the NATO
operation as part of an allied force of about 700 planes. The
undertaking is a costly one, and Clinton also planned to ask the
lawmakers in his meeting Monday and in another scheduled for today
for at least $2.5 billion to help pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was accompanied by a number of lawmakers, including
Reps. Max Sandlin, D-Texas, and Mac Thornberry, R-Texas. Thornberry
said Congress, which reconvenes Tuesday following a two-week Easter
recess, would undertake ``serious discussions'' over whether to
vote on an authorizing resolution for ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   Thornberry had been opposed to the NATO intervention in Kosovo.
But he said with the air campaign well under way, ``We are where we
are.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the use of ground forces should be part of the
overall NATO planning for resolving the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned that we have no good options to ground forces
now. But I think we have to be careful. I think it will take
something other than air power. I'm not saying it's ground troops,
but it's going to take something else to ... end it.``
</P>
<P>
   The comments reflected a growing mood in Congress for ending the
fight with Milosevic as soon as possible, even it takes committing
U.S. soldiers to battle.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to delivering remarks to 2,000 base personnel,
Clinton also met privately with the families of seven people who
died in the tornadoes that struck nearby Bossier Parish last week.
The president used the meeting to announce the availability of
federal aid programs to help uninsured people who were displaced by
the tornadoes repair or rebuild their homes.

   He said NATO ``would like to nip this conflict in the bud before
it destabilizes Europe'' and he warned Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic that he ``should be under no illusions that we will end
it from weariness.''
</P>
<P>
   Relating what he called the ``horrifying'' stories of atrocities
committed by Serb forces in Kosovo, Clinton said American and
allied personnel involved in the air campaign are ``trying to get
people to live in human terms so that people will not be called
upon to fight a wider war caused by someone else's madness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The stories we're hearing now are truly horrifying,'' Clinton
said of Milosevic's effort to rid Kosovo of its predominantly
ethnic Albanian population.
</P>
<P>
   Reciting accounts of mass killings, villages burned and looted,
Clinton accused the Yugoslav dictator of ``seeking literally to
erase the presence of these people in their own land.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We must not let that happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the 20th day of the bombing, Clinton flew to the home base of
some of the B-52s and A-10s involved in the allied operation to
show his support for the crews and families attached to the 8th Air
Force's 2nd Bomb Wing and 917th Air Reserve Wing, both of which
have deployed planes and personnel in Europe to participate in
Operation Allied Force.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton was meeting privately with some crews just
returned from flying missions over Yugoslavia, Defense Secretary
William Cohen was playing down the possibility of deploying ground
troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no consensus for ground troops in the NATO alliance.
There's no consensus for it in Congress or in the country at this
point. And there's no need for it,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen also said that NATO airstrikes against Yugoslav military
targets ``will accelerate'' in the coming days. ``We are now
determined to grind his military forces down.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen added that there will be no negotiations with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Citing intelligence sources, Cohen pointed to growing evidence
that Milosevic's forces are beginning to fall apart under the
steady and intense bombing campaign waged by the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   He said many of the Yugoslav military and police units operating
in Kosovo have been cut off from their command structures. He cited
instances of declining morale among Yugoslav troops and some
desertions, although he offered no details.
</P>
<P>
   Upon his return to Washington on Monday, Clinton met with
congressional leaders to make his case for continuing the air
campaign and once again to stress that he does not believe ground
troops will be necessary to help drive Milosevic's forces from
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has committed about 500 planes to the NATO
operation as part of an allied force of about 700 planes. The
undertaking is a costly one, and Clinton also planned to ask the
lawmakers in his meeting Monday and in another scheduled for today
for at least $2.5 billion to help pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was accompanied by a number of lawmakers, including
Reps. Max Sandlin, D-Texas, and Mac Thornberry, R-Texas. Thornberry
said Congress, which reconvenes Tuesday following a two-week Easter
recess, would undertake ``serious discussions'' over whether to
vote on an authorizing resolution for ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   Thornberry had been opposed to the NATO intervention in Kosovo.
But he said with the air campaign well under way, ``We are where we
are.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the use of ground forces should be part of the
overall NATO planning for resolving the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned that we have no good options to ground forces
now. But I think we have to be careful. I think it will take
something other than air power. I'm not saying it's ground troops,
but it's going to take something else to ... end it.``
</P>
<P>
   The comments reflected a growing mood in Congress for ending the
fight with Milosevic as soon as possible, even it takes committing
U.S. soldiers to battle.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to delivering remarks to 2,000 base personnel,
Clinton also met privately with the families of seven people who
died in the tornadoes that struck nearby Bossier Parish last week.
The president used the meeting to announce the availability of
federal aid programs to help uninsured people who were displaced by
the tornadoes repair or rebuild their homes.

<TEXT>
<P>
   EKATI MINE, Northwest Territories _ To dig rough diamonds out of
the Canadian tundra, operators of the first major diamond mine in
North America face some of the most hostile conditions on earth _
blinding snow, bitter temperatures and a desolation so complete
that for all but two months of the year, when roads cross frozen
lakes, no truck can get within 150 miles of the mine.
</P>
<P>
   Formidable, but all that may be the easier part of working the
Ekati mine. To sell the more than 4 million carats of diamonds they
expect to painstakingly pick out of the ground each year, the
Canadian miners have to deal with one of the most potent market
forces in the world: the legendary De Beers diamond cartel.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, the Canadians need De Beers, a subsidiary of Anglo
American Corp. of South Africa. Without it, they risk disrupting
the cartel's tight grip on the market _ a grip that keeps gem
prices high for all.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, in fact, the mine's owners agreed to sell part of
its production to De Beers. But that deal carries its own risks,
for antitrust regulators in Washington take a dim view of De Beers,
and if the owners get too cozy with the cartel, their American
businesses could feel the heat.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 65 years, De Beers has had a near monopoly on the
world's supply of rough diamonds, in some years handling upward of
80 percent of the uncut stones sold to dealers and polishers around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Formed during the Depression, the cartel _ sometimes called the
world's most successful monopoly _ controls or influences nearly
every step of diamond production, from the pace of extraction in
its own mines and those run by companies with which it contracts,
to the distribution of rough diamonds. It routinely stockpiles
supplies when prices drop, and then restricts their release to help
prices recover.
</P>
<P>
   De Beers argues that this is a benign monopoly benefiting almost
everyone, an argument similar to the one being made now by
Microsoft. But the United States sees it differently. More than
five decades ago, in 1945, the Justice Department initiated
antitrust proceedings in New York against diamond cartel members.
De Beers pulled up stakes, never to return.
</P>
<P>
   The closest it came to an actual run-in with the Justice
Department was in 1994, when General Electric, one of the largest
producers of industrial diamonds, was charged with colluding with
De Beers to raise prices. GE was acquitted. But to this day, De
Beers has no business interests in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Broken Hill Proprietary Co., the huge Australian mining
company that owns 51 percent of the Ekati mine, does have
businesses in the United States _ lots of them, in copper, coal and
other minerals. And BHP, as it is known, does not want to
jeopardize those operations.
</P>
<P>
   BHP, with annual revenues of $22 billion, is new to the diamond
industry, and is not used to dealing with anything like the De
Beers marketing system. After spending years getting approvals from
the government and local Indian communities, and 18 months of
hectic construction, BHP finally began production in October and is
eager to earn back its $700 million investment.
</P>
<P>
   But even BHP acknowledged that the cartel system had kept
diamond demand growing and prices continually rising even as most
other commodities, like gold and silver, have been plagued by
fluctuating conditions that undercut prices and forced mines to
close.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is that they want to market the stones in
an orderly fashion,'' said John Lydall, a mining analyst at First
Marathon Securities Ltd. in Toronto. ``In the diamond industry,
everybody benefits from prices being high.''
</P>
<P>
   De Beers says that includes the 70 percent of American women who
own at least one piece of diamond jewelry and want to be assured of
its value. The De Beers control of the market, and its relentless
advertising _ through its 52-year-old ``A Diamond Is Forever''
campaign _ enhance the desirability of diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   De Beers does not like to lose control over any source,
especially one with the potential of the Canadian find. In 1997,
Tim Capon, a De Beers director and head of the Central Selling
Organization, which since 1930 has been the De Beers diamond buying
and selling arm, told miners in Toronto that if there were too many
independent producers, it would ruin the system that has helped the
global diamond market grow from $20 billion in 1985 to $50 billion
last year.
</P>
<P>
   It all reached a crucial point early last month. BHP, and its
Canadian partner Dia Met Minerals Inc., based in Kelowna, British
Columbia, agreed to sell 35 percent of Ekati production for the
next three years to De Beers, while marketing the rest itself.
Significantly, De Beers will have no control over Ekati's
production.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise seems to have satisfied almost everyone. The
Ekati miners hope that if they sell less than 50 percent of
production to De Beers, the Justice Department will ignore the
joint venture. So far, Washington has been silent.
</P>
<P>
   De Beers now has a foot in the door of what could in a few years
be one of the world's top five diamond-producing regions.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, the global diamond industry seems pleased. Pleased
to see mighty De Beers taken down a peg or two by BHP's independent
stance. Yet pleased also to see the system that has protected
prices for so long remain strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that the Canadians were able to rattle De Beers'
cage a bit, that's a healthy thing,'' said Martin Rapaport,
publisher of the Rapaport Diamond Report, a New York industry
newsletter and price service. ``But De Beers is still pretty much
the only game in town.''
</P>
<P>
   De Beers executives appear unconcerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we're keen to encourage producers to use the
centralized system we have,'' said George Burne, managing director
of De Beers Canada Corp., which has opened an office in Vancouver.
But he said that even though Ekati could produce up to 4 million
carats a year, that would be just a small portion of the
120-million-carat global production.
</P>
<P>
   ``With that volume,'' he said of Ekati, ``it's not going to
bring the house down.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The existence of diamonds in Canada's rugged north had long been
suspected but was hard to pin down. De Beers first prospected in
Alberta 25 years ago, but did not find deposits rich enough to make
mining feasible. Finally, a dogged Canadian geologist, Charles
Fipke, in 1985 came upon telltale signs of diamonds in the Lac de
Gras region of the Northwest Territories, 125 miles below the
Arctic Circle.
</P>
<P>
   Fipke's discoveries set off a diamond rush. What he found was
that many small, shallow lakes in the area were actually the
worn-down remnants of ancient volcanoes from more than 35 million
years ago, when the area was a steamy tropic.
</P>
<P>
   Deposits _ called pipes _ were widespread in Canada's north, but
the secret was finding those likely to contain enough diamonds to
make mining worthwhile. Over the 25-year life of the Ekati project,
annual revenues are expected to average $400 million to $500
million, but that is just a small part of BHP's business.
</P>
<P>
   The area may also soon get a second mine. Diavik, 60 percent
owned by the mining giant Rio Tinto PLC of Britain, could receive
final government approval by the end of the year. And De Beers
itself, through its wholly owned subsidiary Monopros, is in a joint
venture with Mountain Province Mining Inc. that is doing bulk
sampling on what could be Canada's third diamond mine at Kennady
Lake, not far from the other two operations.
</P>
<P>
   Limited diamond mining and prospecting are done in the United
States, primarily in Colorado, Wyoming and Arkansas. Little of the
output is gem quality, so nearly all the production goes for
industrial uses.
</P>
<P>
   Ekati is now basically an open-pit operation, but first the lake
above the pipe had to be fished out and drained. What used to be
Panda Lake is now Panda Pit, said Brad Skeeles, mining manager at
Ekati.
</P>
<P>
   For 24 hours a day, seven days a week, through everything except
blinding whiteout conditions, the surrounding granite rock is
removed in layers to get at the diamond-bearing material called
kimberlite. Once the kimberlite is out of the ground, the process
is comparatively simple, said Michael Rylatt, manager of the
processing plant, though made more complicated by the arctic
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the relentless cold, processing takes place inside
one huge building, three football fields long and more than six
stories high. Outside temperatures can drop to 50 degrees below.
Inside, Rylatt often works in short sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, Rylatt said, Ekati uses a process developed by De
Beers. The ore rock is crushed into smaller and smaller pieces, and
then _ using natural properties of diamonds that make them heavier
than other elements _ the ore is mixed into a slurry and the
diamonds and other heavy minerals are separated from the rock by
centrifugal force.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining material is exposed to X-rays, which makes the
diamonds luminescent. A light-detecting mechanism touches off
powerful jets that eject the suspected diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   Only then does a small group of sorters actually pick out the
diamonds. For security reasons, this is the only part of the
process when human hands touch the diamonds. The plant processes
9,000 tons of ore a day. The yield: roughly one coffee can full of
rough diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental review of the project was controversial and
extensive, with the final agreement alone filling eight 4-inch
binders. The local government required that a high percentage of
BHP's 500 employees come from northern Canada, including Indians
and Inuits. These jobs pay $40,000 to $50,000, on average.
</P>
<P>
   And Ekati agreed to cover the costs of flying the 160 natives
who work at the mine to and from their home communities at the
beginning and end of every two-week shift.
</P>
<P>
   The first Ekati diamonds offered for sale in Antwerp, Belgium,
early this year brought about $125 to $130 a carat, excluding the
largest stones, which will be sold later. The total came to $8.5
million, which Lydall, the First Marathon analyst, considered
encouraging. But the world diamond industry is still recovering
from the economic turmoil in Japan and the Far East; De Beers'
earnings dropped 40 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid the enormous expense of building three processing
plants so close to one another, Ekati and the other two prospective
mines are expected to consolidate some work, said Vahid Fathi, a
mining analyst with ABN Amro Inc., in Chicago. ``There are a lot of
economic and synergistic forces that are going to force a major
consolidation sooner rather than later,'' Fathi said.
</P>
<P>
   Burne of De Beers said the company had had no discussions with
the other Canadian players. Even so, De Beers will not be content
with its small percentage of the Canadian mines for long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows what sort of relationship we can have with them in
the future?'' Burne said. ``I can tell you, we're not going to go
to sleep on it.''

JOURNALIST GIVES ACCOUNT OF TIME WITH KOSOVAR ALBANIAN LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ What happened to Ibrahim Rugova, the leading
ethnic Albanian advocate of nonviolence in Kosovo, during the
Yugoslav offensive against ethnic Albanian civilians there has
preoccupied NATO since the allied bombing campaign against the
Yugoslavs began on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia announced a
unilateral cease-fire last week and said Rugova was negotiating a
peace settlement with him that would allow refugees to return.
Earlier, Yugoslav state-run television showed the Kosovar Albanian
leader smiling and chatting easily with Milosevic, and NATO said
the images were a montage aimed at creating a false propaganda
image of Rugova as a collaborator.
</P>
<P>
   This week's issue of the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel,
published Monday, included a diary by Renate Flottau, its
correspondent in the Balkans. The German reporter wrote that she
was in Rugova's house in Pristina, the provincial capital of
Kosovo, when Yugoslav forces put him under house arrest on March
31.
</P>
<P>
   She stayed with him until last Monday, according to her diary,
which reports that, far from being a willing collaborator of
Milosevic's repression, Rugova was forced by police to do their
bidding.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, March 31, as armed Yugoslav thugs and uniformed
police were systematically driving Albanians from their homes, she
wrote that she arrived at Rugova's house shortly before 11 a.m. and
found him alive and defiant.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I was about to leave,'' she wrote, ``Rugova's
brother-in-law burst into the room with a warning finger on his
lips. We crept carefully down the stairs from the second floor and
saw police cars and armored vehicles approaching the house and then
stopping in front of it. Two dozen men from the Yugoslav special
police jumped out.''
</P>
<P>
   Police broke down the doors and pushed the 17 adults and
children in the house into a single room on the second floor of the
three-story building. Rugova and the reporter agreed that it would
be too dangerous for her to declare that she was a journalist, so
she pretended to be a family friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside, we can hear the shattering of windows, the smashing
of doors,'' she wrote. ``The police are apparently occupying all
the surrounding houses.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Radovan Urosevic, from the Serbian Media Center, a
propaganda center in Pristina, arrived. ``Rugova is told he has to
go on camera and say he is in good health and a free man,'' her
account continues. ``Anything other than that will not be broadcast
over state television and radio. And it will also be dangerous for
all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, April 1, Rugova was driven to Belgrade, the
Yugoslav capital, for a meeting with Milosevic. ``When Rugova comes
back at 6:30 p.m., he is visibly upset,'' Mrs. Flottau writes.
``The puzzled world public is shown pictures of a relaxed, smiling
Rugova talking with Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Rugova told her, the meeting was tense and President
Milosevic was furious. ```Not a hair on your head will be harmed,
our people are making sure of that,''' Milosevic told Rugova, who
signed a communique prepared for him.
</P>
<P>
   ```It was just `a sentence,' he explains later over a glass of
whisky,'' she writes. ``Besides, he says he is convinced that
western leaders will read no significance into his signature.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, April 2, still a prisoner in his own home, Rugova had
an assistant call the U.S. ambassador, Christopher Hill, in Skopje,
the capital of Macedonia, and later Milosevic's office in Belgrade.
Rugova asked for safe passage to Skopje. But he was refused.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, April 3, Yugoslavia's deputy prime minister, Nikola
Sainovic, arrived at the house at 9 p.m. ``Rugova, he says in a
mocking tone, is a free man. He can go to Macedonia if he wants.
But he should be aware that on the way, angry Serbs could `stage'
all manner of incidents. An unmistakable warning.''
</P>
<P>
   On Easter Sunday, April 4, ``Rugova waits for a reassuring call
from Belgrade. It comes around noon, but with the news that he is
to receive the Russian ambassador in the evening together with
Sainovic.''
</P>
<P>
   For security reasons, Ambassador Yuri Kotov postponed the visit
until Monday, April 5. After a night of NATO bombing that shook the
house to its foundation, he arrived in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rugova sees an opportunity for me to get away,'' Mrs. Flottau
concluded, and she melted into the crowd of Yugoslav and other
journalists the police allowed into the house to cover the meeting.
She returned to her hotel on April 6, Mrs. Flottau wrote, but after
being interrogated and searched by Yugoslav police, she was warned
by friends on the hotel staff to flee, and she arrived by bus in
Belgrade last Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials consider her account vindication of their concern
for Rugova's safety and well-being. The magazine has been sharply
critical of the allied bombing campaign.

 &HT;    Ohio seniors win scholarships for proficiency
 &HT;    By Mark Fisher
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ More than 40,000 Ohio high school seniors earned
$500 scholarships by acing all five sections of the 12th-grade
proficiency test they took in February.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, 41 percent of the 99,515 Ohio seniors who took the
tests in writing, reading, mathematics, citizenship and science
passed all five sections and earned the scholarships, which can be
used to meet any educational expense in any public or private
college in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The scholarships, offered for the first time for the class of
1999, are designed to provide an incentive for students to excel on
a test that is not a requirement for graduation, as is the Ohio
Ninth Grade Proficiency Test.
</P>
<P>
   All 12th-grade students who have passed the ninth-grade exam _
and who are not excused from having to take the test because of
disabilities _ are required to take the 12th-grade proficiency
tests. Students must take both the ninth- and 12th-grade tests, but
they are not required to pass the 12th-grade test.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio Department of Education released results of the
12th-grade test on its web site (http://www.ode.ohio.gov) Monday,
though its district-by-district results do not include figures on
the number of students in each district who took and passed all
five sections of the test. A department spokeswoman said the scores
of a small number of makeup tests have not been tabulated and
included in the school district statistics, so state officials
decided not to release incomplete data.
</P>
<P>
   This year's senior class improved math, science and writing
scores compared to last year's class, education department
officials said. Citizenship scores fell slightly, while reading
scores remained about the same as last year.
</P>
<P>
   Students also can earn honors-level scores on the 12th-grade
exams. Those who achieved an honors score in at least one test area
and those who meet proficient-level standards in all five test
areas will be awarded a Certificate of Recognition by the state
board of education. About 51 percent of seniors tested this year
were recognized for their performance, compared to 46 percent of
last year's seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Herbert Franklin, superintendent of the Jefferson Twp. school
district, where 36 of 37 seniors passed the writing portion of the
proficiency exam, said it appeared extra efforts in writing
appeared to be paying off. The 97-percent passage rate for the
writing section placed Jefferson Twp. among the region's
highest-scoring districts in that section. But on the citizenship
and math portions of the test, only about one-third of seniors met
the state standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to give up. We're going to keep trying and
keep looking for answers and keep trying new things,'' Franklin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton school administrators were not available for comment
Monday, but a testing official said the district's overall passage
rate on the 12th-grade test rose from 18 percent in 1998 to 24
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   The 12th-grade scores are among the criteria the state uses to
assess the performance of school districts in the state ``report
cards.'' The trial run for the cards was released last week.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Tave Zelman, Ohio's superintendent of public instruction,
said of the test results: ``More and more, our students are meeting
the challenges put forth by higher education and the workplace.

   ATLANTA _ In an awesome burst of friskiness, the trees of
northern Georgia have coated Atlanta with a thick yellow veil of
fertility, and the city is beginning to wheeze under the weight.
</P>
<P>
   Pollen, the male reproductive agent of plants, is everywhere. In
the mornings it is heaped in sticky mounds and swirls on the
sidewalks, the windshields, the patio furniture, the dogs. Sweep it
up _ wearing, of course, one of the white surgical masks on half
the faces of the city _ and it is back again, drifting through the
window screens and electrifying once-proper dark shoes.
</P>
<P>
   No one is paying attention to the Dow anymore; instead, the city
has awakened for the last week to watch the pollen count reach
ever-more-absurd heights. One radio station had a pollen-count
guessing game on Friday, and no one even came close. On Monday
morning the count for the Atlanta area reached an all-time high of
6,013 grains per cubic meter, which is virtually unimaginable
considering that the national scale says a count of 120 is
considered ``very high.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's count is 33 percent higher than in any previously
recorded spring in Atlanta, and far higher than any other city in
the country, except for Tulsa, Okla., which reported a count of
6,299 over the weekend. Michael Muilenberg, a Harvard University
public health instructor who keeps the records for the National
Pollen Bureau, said the highest count ever recorded was about
14,000 two years ago in Tulsa, which has a high concentration of
extremely prolific mountain cedars. But he said the Atlanta count
was quite impressive.
</P>
<P>
   The sneeze count, naturally, is also off the charts. Margaret
Higgins, a nurse at the Atlanta Allergy and Asthma Clinic, which
has kept the city's pollen counts for the last decade, estimated
that she sneezed 30 times in five minutes at one point during the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the mistake of eating outside on the patio,'' Ms.
Higgins said. ``An allergy sufferer cannot do that. I usually wear
a mask and goggles when I go out, but it was so nice that I
couldn't resist. Now I'm paying for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of patients at her clinic and others scattered around
the area are also experiencing one of the worst weeks of their
respiratory lives.
</P>
<P>
   Allergy clinics are booked up three weeks in advance. Some
pharmacies have experienced shortages of Claritin, Allegra or
Benadryl, and regular users have been known to panic and plead with
their druggists for refills.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists say it may be another product of the recent global
weather phenomenon known as La Nina: a warm, dry winter, followed
by an early spring and an unusual confluence of the germination
cycles of several species of trees. The lack of rain recently and a
wind strong enough to whip up a spectacular fire just outside
downtown on Sunday have also been blamed, but for most residents
there are no satisfactory explanations. There is only the
chartreuse torrent of spring, and it is in every lung in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Though the most visible pollen _ the fertility agent of pine
trees _ is said to be relatively harmless to breathers, it has its
own form of pathology. Last week, a combination of pollen and a
light coating of drizzle was blamed for slickening the pavement of
Interstate 285, causing a chain-reaction pileup that damaged or
destroyed 18 vehicles in DeKalb County, northeast of town.
</P>
<P>
   Many people will not even venture into their back yards.
Electrostatic air filters have become popular, and the television
meteorologists are advising everyone to take frequent showers, wash
their hands constantly, stay away from pets and avoid drying
clothes outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate it, but there's nothing else to do,'' said Lee R.
Woodall, a designer with Kitchens of Atlanta whose eyes water and
chest contracts the moment she walks outside. ``When they go to the
bio-hazard suits, we could wear those. I look good in silver.''
</P>
<P>
   A good rain would rinse the air, but there has not been a good
rain in a few weeks. Many sufferers say they are ready to seed the
clouds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just one good, solid rain _ that's all we need,'' said Marc S.
Komisarow, a financial planner whose wife spent the weekend in bed
inhaling steroids and ingesting Zertac, an anti-allergen. ``And
also, if people would just stop planting trees in their yards.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even for Atlanta, one of the most heavily forested cities in the
country with an abundance of southern pine and oak trees, the
numbers seemed a bit impossible. Several national experts said the
count seemed unlikely, and questioned whether the Atlanta counting
machine might be a little too close to a libidinous conifer.
</P>
<P>
   But at the Atlanta Allergy and Asthma Clinic, Dr. Kathleen
Sheerin said there was little doubt that the numbers were correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in Dallas over the weekend, and they were all excited
because they had a count of 1,000,'' Dr. Sheerin said. ``To me, it
was like a breath of clean, crisp air.''

 &HT;    Tribe win on Fryman's extra-inning homer
 &HT;    By Sean McClelland
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The more Dave Burba thought about it, his
late-inning vantage point couldn't have been better.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the competitor in him would have preferred to have the
ball in his hands a little longer Monday, but what difference did
it make in the end? The Cleveland Indians, for whom he had gotten
the first 19 outs of a new Jacobs Field season, beat the Kansas
City Royals, 5-2, on Travis Fryman's three-run homer in the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Said Burba, a Dayton native who grew up in Springfield, ``It was
just a lot of fun to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Burba was in the clubhouse with ice on his right arm in the
eighth inning. He was watching on television when center fielder
Kenny Lofton threw out Joe Randa at home plate to complete a double
play, and in the home half, when Enrique Wilson, filling in at
shortstop for the injured Omar Vizquel, drove a game-tying, two-run
homer to right field off Scott Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just sat in here and screamed myself hoarse,'' said Burba,
who was able to leave 15 tickets for family members after obtaining
six from backup catcher Einar Diaz. ``I knew somewhere down the
line someone would get the big hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Fryman's first home run of the season came off Jose Santiago
after Jim Thome had walked and Wil Cordero had singled.
</P>
<P>
   It sent a crowd of 42,798 into hysterics and made the afternoon
worthwhile for Burba, who never before as a major leaguer had
started any kind of opener. This made up for last season, he
figured, when the Cincinnati Reds pulled the Opening Day assignment
out from under him, dealing him to Cleveland at the last minute for
first baseman Sean Casey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a special day, a real thrill for me,'' Burba said. ``I
tried not to think about it, because the more you think about it,
the more pressure you put on yourself. I was a little nervous, but
I got through it. You can't let outside influences determine how
you pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   The Royals took a 1-0 lead in the third on Johnny Damon's RBI
single, then made it 2-0 in the fourth when Jermaine Dye sliced an
opposite-field homer to right that barely found its way into the
seats.
</P>
<P>
   When Burba faltered in the seventh, allowing a double to Chad
Krueter and a one-out single to Carlos Febles, manager Mike
Hargrove summoned lefty Mark Langston, who got Carlos Beltran to
ground into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland (6-1) has won six in a row, and this was just another
example of how things have been breaking right for the team.
Langston joined the Indians on Monday, replacing Ricky Rincon, who
was placed on the 15-day disabled list with soreness and swelling
in his elbow.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, Randa's leadoff triple against Langston seemed to
spell trouble, especially when Damon, the next batter, drove one to
left-center. But Lofton, who caught the ball running toward left
field, unleashed a perfect throw and Sandy Alomar withstood the
collision. It would be Kansas City's final threat as Paul Shuey
then retired the next seven batters, striking out four.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton also made an amazing over-the-head catch to rob Mike
Sweeney leading off the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do you start?'' Burba wondered. ``There were too many
turning points, too many heroes. It just goes to show you how much
talent we have here.

 &HT;    Reds use four home runs to ruin Cubs opener 7-2
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The men of muscle always are affixed with a
frightening nickname _ Murderer's Row, The Pittsburgh Lumber
Company, The Big Blue Brew Crew, The Bronx Bombers, The Bash
Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   So, is it too early to find something powerful and catchy to
supply headline writers for the 1999 Cincinnati Reds?
</P>
<P>
   Probably, it is. Even utility infielder Mark Lewis made the
point Monday afternoon in the postgame Wrigley Field clubhouse
after the Reds pounded four home runs to spoil the home opener for
the Chicago Cubs, 7-2.
</P>
<P>
   With the four home runs, the Reds have 16 in seven games _ the
first Cincinnati team since 1986 to hit homers in its first seven
games. The 1986 Reds homered in its first 12 games, but only hit 17
in that 12-game span.
</P>
<P>
   In the joyous clubhouse, the players hooted and hollered when
ESPN flashed a graphic about Monday's explosion _ two homers by
Mike Cameron, one by Barry Larkin, one by Eddie Taubensee.
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, in down-in-the-gutter terms, Lewis advised his
teammates not to submerge themselves in self-congratulatory
postures so early in the season.
</P>
<P>
   But, indeed it is fun right now for a team that appeared to have
little power coming out of spring training, except for maybe Greg
Vaughn, who has only two of those 16 homers.
</P>
<P>
   Well, today, April 13, 1999, the Cincinnati Reds lead the
baseball world in home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe pitching coach Don Gullett was being prophetic before the
game when he bounced a new baseball off the carpeted clubhouse
floor and when it ricocheted to his chin he said, ``Tell me the
baseballs aren't hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Cameron was the day's happiest man, returning to Chicago for the
first time after the team on the other side of town, the White Sox,
traded him in the off-season. His two home runs not only stabbed
the Cubs, they tore the guts out of the Bleacher Bums, who cascaded
insults onto the Reds' center fielder.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were on me all day, telling me how bad I am,'' Cameron
said. ``I just laughed inside and said nothing because we have two
more games here.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, though, put it best for Cameron. As Cameron walked into
the post-game clubhouse, Vaughn welcomed him with, ``Welcome back
to Chi-town.''
</P>
<P>
   Cameron broke open a close game with a home run in the eighth
against Matt Karchner that made it 4-1 and a two-run blast over the
bleachers and onto Waveland Avenue in the ninth off Rod Beck that
made it 7-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some fun today, doing it in Chicago, and it was some of
the best fun I've had since I started playing baseball,'' Cameron
said. ``Today was a great showing of me. . .doing the type of
things I can do. I had a tough time in Chicago last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Jack McKeon says a swirl of talent is bubbling just
beneath the surface of the 26-year-old leadoff hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential is there,'' McKeon said. ``He hit 14 home runs
two years ago for the White Sox and he has five-tool talent. The
question is when all that talent comes through. This has to lift
his confidence up. We think he has a chance to be a hell of a
ballplayer who can hit. . .and hit with power.''
</P>
<P>
   Larkin started the barrage with a two-run blast off starter
Kevin Tapani in the third, then Tapani departed with a stiff back.
Taubensee led the seventh with a homer, then Cameron's double
explosion finished it off.
</P>
<P>
   The beneficiary was pitcher Steve Avery, who breezed through
seven innings and held the Cubs to one run and three hits. . .and
it could have been no runs and two hits if Cameron hadn't lost
Mickey Morandini's fly ball in the sun in the third. It fell for a
double and Morandini scored on Lance Johnson's single.
</P>
<P>
   Avery was the fifth straight Reds starter to pitch into at least
the seventh inning and a Cincinnati staff hasn't done that six
straight times since June 25-July 1, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Although he walked five, Avery spread them out and kept the Cubs
lunging by throwing 40 changeups among his 108 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitching the way I did last year, without a fastball, paid off
today,'' Avery said. ``My changeup was working and I threw some
good fastballs on certain counts. When I get my fastball working,
I'll be more effective. I needed 108 pitches for seven innings.
When I cut down the walks, I'll be able to go nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I stayed with the changeup . . . they weren't looking good
on changeups, so I stayed with it,'' Avery added.

NATO FOREIGN MINISTERS SHOW RESOLVE AGAINST MILOSEVIC 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO foreign ministers expressed strong resolve
Monday to force Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to give up
his campaign against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and allow an
international force to police a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's air campaign ``will continue until our terms are
met,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said after her first
meeting with NATO colleagues since the airstrikes began three weeks
ago today.
</P>
<P>
   Despite scattered cloudiness over the Balkans, NATO struck
throughout the day, including what appeared to be a missile attack
on a bridge in southern Serbia just as a passenger train bound for
Greece, was crossing. Serb officials said nine people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the four-hour foreign ministers' meeting, Albright
praised ``a really very strong and remarkable unity among 19
members of this alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly Milosevic is trying to divide NATO,'' Albright said.
``But we will not be divided.''
</P>
<P>
   The foreign ministers issued a communique restating the aims of
getting Serb forces out of Kosovo and sending in an international
force that would give confidence to the hundreds of thousands of
ethnic Kosovars Albanians who have fled that they can return home.
</P>
<P>
   Signaling the costs that lie ahead after the fighting is over,
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said alliance countries and
other developed nations would need to help rebuild war-ravaged
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike earlier alliance statements, the communique did not
emphasize the central role NATO would play in a cease-fire force,
perhaps with a thought to making participation more palatable to
Russia, which has strongly condemned the airstrikes on a fellow
Slav nation.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said, however, that ``it would be a mistake for people
to think that there's any attempt not to make it quite clear that
NATO is the core aspect of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright flew from alliance headquarters in Brussels to a
meeting Tuesday in Oslo, Norway, with Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, the Yugoslav parliament took the symbolic step of
voting to join an alliance with Russia and Belarus, apparently
looking to get Moscow's military involved against NATO _ a step
that Ivanov, in the Russian capital, said is not in the offing.
</P>
<P>
   In the day's military action, the train was struck while
crossing a bridge near Grdelicka, 180 miles south of Belgrade. NATO
described the bridge as ``an important resupply route'' for
Yugoslav forces in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO also struck for the second time one of Yugoslavia's oil
refineries in the industrial town of Pancevo across the Danube
River from Belgrade and a Yugo car factory in a complex at
Kragujevac southwest of Belgrade that also makes military vehicles
and weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Away from the NATO foreign ministers' meeting, German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder rejected calls by left-wing members of his Social
Democratic Party to end the alliance's air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``An end to airstrikes would not bring us one millimeter
closer'' to peace in Yugoslavia, Schroeder said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a responsibility toward our allies in NATO,''
Schroeder said. ``We also have a responsibility toward the people
of Kosovo, who have become victims of the most gruesome human
rights violations.''
</P>
<P>
   In London, Defense Minister George Robertson said that ``if
President Milosevic assumed that NATO would drop a few bombs and
just leave, he has now been proved conclusively wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The outcome of this campaign is not in doubt, it is only a
question of how long it takes NATO to reverse Milosevic's ethnic
cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Albright said that under any settlement, ``the people
of Kosovo must be given the democratic self-government which they
have too long been denied,'' she denied that partition of the
province was not the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no discussion of that, or that is not an option that
is being considered, certainly not an option that I favor,''
Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   Solana said that NATO's ``operations are taking a heavy toll of
President Milosevic's army and security forces. We are tightening
the screw on those forces in Kosovo, which are responsible for
repressing civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the political and the resources to maintain our
military pressure until Milosevic backs down.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen, in Louisiana with President
Clinton to visit B-52 pilots, renewed the administration opposition
to using ground troops in Kosovo before a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there is no need, according to our commanding officers,''
Cohen said. ``So until such time as that changes ... we would not
even consider it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said NATO's airstrikes ``are systematically choking off
the Yugoslav army and security forces in Kosovo by cutting their
supply lines. As we isolate and weaken the Serb forces in Kosovo,
we are launching aggressive attacks against troops on the ground by
hitting staging areas, headquarters and forces in the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Detailing the damage, Maj. Gen. Charles Wald, vice director of
strategic planning for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the Yugoslav
coordinated air defense system ``has been impacted, I would say in
a big way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of their TV reception from a military standpoint, from
their command and control standpoint, has been degraded,'' Wald
said. ``The sustainability for petroleum oil and lubricants and
ammo has been reduced significantly. The military production has
been moderately damaged in the industry and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Wald said that although all of Milosevic's ability to produce
petroleum oil and lubricants has been destroyed, ``he still has
quite a bit of reserve.''

 &HT;    Schott entertains offers for Reds
 &HT;    By Marc Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Between rushing from and to their luxury
automobiles, members of the Cincinnati Reds ownership group spent a
long time in the Queen City Club Monday afternoon discussing Marge
Schott's sale of her majority interest in the team.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it was not something any of the group would
discuss as they left.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Lindner, a local business icon, was the last to arrive for
the meeting, called for 2 p.m. (he pulled his Rolls Royce into the
lot at 2:15) and the first to leave at 4:50.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had any comment, Lindner _ shy with the media _
said, ``No, not one thing.''
</P>
<P>
   About five minutes later, Schott had her Buick Riviera driven by
a valet close to a back door and did not acknowledge the presence
of a half dozen reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was held because Schott, who owns 6 1/2 of the Reds
15 shares _ or 42 percent _ was recently offered $65 million for 5
1/2 of those shares by Cleveland attorney Larry Dolan.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds limited partners _ including Lindner, George Strike,
Bill Reik and Louise Nippert _ have the option of matching that
offer, and speculation was they did Monday.
</P>
<P>
   However, apparently no action was taken as the sides dickered
through their lawyers over what constituted a legitimate purchase
offer. Schott wants more for her shares, and a printed report
Monday suggested she had an even higher offer from Steve Schott,
former director of business operations for the Reds and the cousin
of Schott's late husband.
</P>
<P>
   By 6 p.m., Strike, Reik, Nippert and several lawyers were still
inside the building arguing (according to a witness) merits of the
sale. They would not comment on what they decided or whether they
decided anything.

THOSE ROLLICKING STATES OF THE NATION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: This story also moved in the ``l'' lifestyle file)  
 By LEAH GARCHIK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ Here's why  &UR; Garrison Keillor &LR; , host of the St. Paul-based
radio show ``A Prairie Home Companion,'' is at war with Minnesota
Governor  &UR; Jesse Ventura &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   First, Keillor told Time magazine he thought the governor was
``a great big honking bullet-headed shovel-faced `mutha' who talks
in a steroid growl.'' Then he wrote a satiric novel, ``Me, by Jimmy
(Big Boy) Valente,'' which he published in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura wasn't going to take that lying down, especially as he
was about to publish his own book _ ``I Ain't Got Time to Bleed'' _
about his rise to greatness. Ventura announced that he would kill
state funding for Minnesota Public Radio, which produces Keillor's
show.
</P>
<P>
   Keillor has responded with weekly criticism of Ventura, whom he
said has ``the IQ of a salad bar.'' He told the Los Angeles Times
that ``the governor owns Jet Skis and loves to get on them on a
quiet Sunday afternoon and ride the hell out of them. I'm the
person sitting on the porch of a cabin on shore, quietly wishing
the person making that infernal buzzing noise would hit a dock and
break a leg.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   _ Here's why  &UR; Garrison Keillor &LR; , host of the St. Paul-based
radio show ``A Prairie Home Companion,'' is at war with Minnesota
Governor  &UR; Jesse Ventura &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   First, Keillor told Time magazine he thought the governor was
``a great big honking bullet-headed shovel-faced `mutha' who talks
in a steroid growl.'' Then he wrote a satiric novel, ``Me, by Jimmy
(Big Boy) Valente,'' which he published in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura wasn't going to take that lying down, especially as he
was about to publish his own book _ ``I Ain't Got Time to Bleed'' _
about his rise to greatness. Ventura announced that he would kill
state funding for Minnesota Public Radio, which produces Keillor's
show.
</P>
<P>
   Keillor has responded with weekly criticism of Ventura, whom he
said has ``the IQ of a salad bar.'' He told the Los Angeles Times
that ``the governor owns Jet Skis and loves to get on them on a
quiet Sunday afternoon and ride the hell out of them. I'm the
person sitting on the porch of a cabin on shore, quietly wishing
the person making that infernal buzzing noise would hit a dock and
break a leg.''

 Netcasters Who Run With the Bulls 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
``Digital extremist'' Chris Courtney briefly debated whether he
should mount a tiny camera on the horns of a raging bull for his
online company's latest excellent adventure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought about it, but decided that the bulls are sacred and
we didn't want to piss anyone off,'' said Courtney, 30, founder of
1stbyte.com ( &LR; www.1stbyte.com &LR; ), a San Francisco company that &UR;  &LR; is
earning a reputation for Webcasting off-the-wall events.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he and his GenX online cohorts will be wearing cameras
on their heads and other body parts when they participate in the
running of the bulls in Pamplona, Spain, in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other camera person is a paramedic, so if either of us is
gored we'll be OK,'' he said. ``It should make for a pretty
interesting cybercast.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, 1stbyte's roving digital cameras have gone to the Webby
Awards in San Francisco last month and on some wild club dates at
SoMa nightspots. The gigs are paid for by event organizers who want
their shows broadcast on the Internet. Three to 12 people work on
each broadcast. &UR;  &LR; Courtney said his crew takes about six weeks to
prepare for a show.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, covering an event can be painful. During a
mountain-climbing competition in February, one of the company's
daredevil crew members sprained an ankle after falling off a cliff.
</P>
<P>
   On tap: coverage of the X Games in San Francisco this summer
(``We're going skydiving with the athletes if they let us,''
Courtney said) and a series of Hawaiian surfing contests in the
fall. 1stbyte.com is also considering an offer from a professional
wrestling organization in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to broadcast static sports; we want to show
extreme events,'' Courtney said. ``My dream is to Netcast sumo
wrestling in Japan or a foreign war with a handheld camera.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ONE LAST BARK &QL; 
To the end, former Netscape Communications CEO Jim Barksdale was
the quintessential Southern gentleman.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a brutal online turf war with Microsoft and stinging
criticism from the press over Netscape's strategy, Barksdale
maintained a cool demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   But mention that America Online's $10 billion acquisition of
Netscape effectively marks the end of Netscape, and his drawl turns
to a growl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not the dearly departed,'' he said last week. ``Most
people in business would like to be in the position (Netscape) is
in. Look, the company (has) one of the most well-known brands in
the world. It was and will continue to be a trendsetter.''
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that Netscape's hyperkinetic history took its toll
on Barksdale, who is bowing out as CEO at the relatively young age
of 56.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going into active management ever again,'' vowed
Barksdale. Instead, he will spend his time pushing for better
education and housing in his home state of Mississippi, lobbying on
behalf of AOL and raising campaign funds for presidential hopeful
George W. Bush. Barksdale is a member of AOL's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale and wife Sally are moving from Palo Alto to Colorado
this summer, and will also build a part-time residence in
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MORE THAN ZERO &QL; 
NetZero, based in the Los Angeles County hamlet of Westlake Village
(until now, best known as the headquarters for Jafra Cosmetics),
overnight has bolted into the Top 10 Internet service providers in
the country, with 740,000 customers. It ranks far behind America
Online, with 16 million members, but ahead of Prodigy, which has
638,000.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, NetZero had 500,000 users.
</P>
<P>
   If it continues growing at the same pace, CEO Ronald Burr
predicts that by next spring it will hit 6 million subscribers and
turn a profit. NetZero is planning an initial public offering by
year-end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Word-of-mouth reaction has been phenomenal,'' said Janet Daly,
NetZero's vice president of marketing. ``Where we are today has far
exceeded all of our internal forecasts.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it's hard not to grow rapidly when you're giving
away your service for free. Most ISPs charge users about $20 a
month. NetZero relies solely on ad revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The only ``price'' users have to pay is to endure a barrage of
one-by-three-inch  &LR; 1-by-3-inch banner ads, which NetZero displays
on computer screens whenever its users are online. If you close an
ad, the service shuts down. NetZero's advertisers include eBay,
Macy's and Disney.
</P>
<P>
   Subscribers are stampeding the 2-year-old company's site
( &LR; www.netzero.com &LR; ) to download software for free Net access. They
get also get free e-mail and a choice of browsers _ Netscape
Communicator or Microsoft Internet Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   NetZero is not the first to offer free Net access. Atbigger.net
of San Jose promised customers free Net access for life, before it
folded last year.
</P>
<P>
   NetZero says it can avoid a similar fate because it has deeper
pockets. It is backed by Pasadena's Idealab, the same venture
capital firm that financed Free-PC.com, a Pasadena company that
gives away personal computers to people who agree to watch ads on
them.
</P>
<P>
   But some industry observers question whether NetZero can
maintain its lightning-fast growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not entirely convinced the free movement isn't a passing
gimmick,'' said Greg Tally, associate editor at BoardWatch magazine
in Golden, Colo. ``Banner ads aren't as effective as advertisers
hoped. The click-through rates are dropping; the novelty of this
new form has worn off.'' Plus, NetZero will probably face the same
problems that other ISPs encountered as their subscriber base
swelled: bottlenecks, long waits for technical support and a higher
churn rate as customers get frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Cautions aside, most Internet sages are high on NetZero. In
fact, they're convinced the company won't get a chance to go public
because a larger ISP (read America Online) will swoop in and
acquire NetZero with its bulging customer list.

 &HT;    Dramatic rescue unfolds as firefighters battle blaze
 &HT;    By Sandra Eckstein
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The first call came in at 2:35 p.m. Monday, a fire at
the Old Cotton Mill. But arriving firefighters quickly realized
this was not a routine fire. Huge orange balls billowed from
windows, and thick black smoke, stoked by strong winds, quickly
filled the afternoon air.
</P>
<P>
   At 3:10 p.m. Ivers Sims was discovered clinging to the top of a
massive crane next to the burning building, and a clock begins
running as rescuers scrambled to beat the heat and fire that
threaten Sims life. Here's how the rescue unfolded:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  3:14 p.m. Sims climbs from the gondola that housed the
controls for the crane and moves to the far end of the crane to
escape the heat and smoke.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  3:15 p.m. The roof of the burning build collapses, causing
nearby buildings to catch fire as the flames, now fanned by a 30
mph wind, begin to spread.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  3:16 p.m. Sims reaches the far end of the crane. He hugs a
rail and looks downward at the flames licking the base of his
crane.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  3:20 p.m. Connie Smith, a spokeswoman for the Atlanta Fire
Department, puts out a call for help. Smith says the department
needs a chopper ``that can withstand this intense heat.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  3:25 p.m. The Department of Natural Resources and the Georgia
Department of Transportation call and offer helicopters for the
rescue.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  3:33 p.m. Sims, perched 220 feet in the air, carefully climbs
onto the counterweights to escape the heat and smoke.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  3:34 p.m. Pilot Boyd Clines of the DNR takes off from Charlie
Brown Airport in a Bell Long Ranger L-4 helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  3:37 p.m. Sims lays down on the weights in the strong winds,
stretching out on his stomach.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  3:42 p.m. A local news traffic helicopter lands in a nearby
field and firefighters rush to outfit it for the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  3:49 p.m. The DNR helicopter arrives, and the decision is made
that it is better suited for the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  3:51 p.m. The gondola of the crane bursts into flames from the
intense heat below.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  3:55 p.m. A Life Flight helicopter goes by, checking the heat
in the area.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  3:56 p.m. The DNR helicopter lifts off, with firefighter Matt
Moseley dangling below from a 50-foot line. &QR;  4:01 p.m. Moseley
touches down on the crane as Sims sits up on top of the
counterweights. Moseley secures a harness to Sims.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  4:03 p.m. Moseley gives the sign and Clines lifts off with
both men dangling from the line below.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  4:04 p.m. The two men are flown in a circular fashion to avoid
sudden winds, taking them over the railroad and MARTA tracks,
buildings, billboards and Oakland Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  4:05 p.m. Clines gently lowers the men down on a grassy area
between two roads. The men's feet touch the ground, and they drop
to their knees and begin unfastening the harnesses. Seven firemen
run to assist them. Two men bring in a gurney. Sims stands, then is
helped onto the gurney.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  4:07 p.m. Sims is loaded into the ambulance and raced to
Atlanta Medical Center.

 Going, Going, Gone _ `Bay Traders' Sold on Auctions

   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
You want to make it big as an Internet entrepreneur? You could
start up a company, search for financing, hire staff and go public.
Or you could just clean out your garage.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Gina Ward of Columbus, Ohio, got started. Ward, 47,
fretted about her future after she got ``downsized'' out of her
executive secretary job at Borden Inc. last year. Then a friend
prodded her to put some of the junk she had acquired at yard sales
up for sale on eBay, the giant Internet auction house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had this sugar bowl I'd bought for 50 cents. I put it on
eBay for $7.99, and I started getting letters from people saying,
`Do you know what you have there?'''
</P>
<P>
   The sugar bowl turned out to be a rare Noritake humidor for
sugar cubes. Ward's 50-cent investment netted her nearly $400 _ and
she was hooked.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Ralph, 57, retired in June, and the two have made
trading on eBay their business ever since, buying up pottery,
dishes, sheet music, thimbles, Depression glass and fishing lures
at yard sales and auctions in Ohio and selling them for a profit on
eBay. They now post 25 to 100 items a week for sale and, some
months, bring in as much as $5,000 in gross revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The Wards are part of a new breed of ``Bay traders,'' people who
make a living selling stuff on the Internet. Most of them prefer
eBay, which has 85 percent of the online auction market.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``day traders,'' who work full-time buying and selling
stock online, Bay traders spend endless hours at their computers,
checking the latest bids on their auctions.
</P>
<P>
   Bay traders say they get higher prices at auctions than at swap
meets or collectibles shows because bidding generates excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you need is two people who want the same thing, and the
price goes up,'' Gina Ward said. And the Internet's worldwide reach
makes multiple bids more likely.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``If someone wants to sit down and work, they can make a small
fortune on eBay. You just have to find something other people want
and sell it,'' said Ray Geeck, who with his wife, Anne, works seven
days a week auctioning off antique dolls.
</P>
<P>
   The couple used to sell at doll shows or at their store in Lake
Panasoffkee, Fla. But in the fall of 1997, they ventured online.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were getting $300 and $400 on eBay for things we couldn't
sell for $125 at the shows,'' said Ray Geeck. They gave up the doll
shows and stuck to their computer _ which eventually became several
computers and a staff of 10. Last year, the business grossed about
$1 million, and a few weeks ago, the Geecks paid cash for a
three-bedroom house with a perfect view of the lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``EBay isn't about auctions. It's about connecting buyers and
sellers. It's enabled people to do something they couldn't do
before _ faster, better and cheaper,'' said Meg Whitman, chief
executive officer of the San Jose company and herself a new
stock-option billionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Maron spent a dozen years selling animation cels _
individual hand-painted pictures used to make cartoons _ to some 30
or 40 galleries from his offices in suburban Chicago. A little more
than a year ago, he shifted all of his business to eBay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am satisfied beyond anything I could have imagined,'' said
Maron, who has twice outgrown his office space since making the
shift.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows how many people are full-time eBay sellers. Late
last year, the company singled out 10,000 people and crowned them
PowerSellers, signifying sales of more than $2,000 a month. But not
everyone has quit their day jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Drum, who sells antique stock certificates from his home in
Toledo, Ohio, has made enough from eBay and from his own Web site
to buy a new computer desk, fax machine, printer, scanner and a new
Mercedes Benz. But, newly married and 34, he's not ready to give up
his job as a supervisor at a plant that manufactures Hunt's
snack-pack pudding. There's no telling, he said, how long the
auction business will hold out.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Sperber, a longtime coin dealer in Lincroft, N.J., said
she uses eBay because it saves her money. She pays $1,500 for an ad
in a coin magazine with 75,000 readers. A listing on eBay costs her
$2 or less and has a potential reach of 2.1 million people.
Although not all 2.1 million are interested in old coins, Sperber
said some of her auctions have had as many as 10,000 hits.
</P>
<P>
   If the item sells on eBay, sellers must pay a commission of 1.25
to 5 percent. Sperber expects her business, Legend Numismatics, to
do about $1 million in sales on eBay this year.
</P>
<P>
   Online auctions also let people operate from anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 500 miles from the nearest city, Detroit, and we don't
get much traffic in the winter months _ and winter is most of what
we're about up here,'' said Judy Owen, an antique-furniture dealer
in remote Traverse City, Mich. About a year ago, she put a few
pieces up for sale on eBay, and in three weeks, she'd made $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Like any small business, Bay traders still have to worry about
things like shipping, billing and bad debts.
</P>
<P>
   The Wards have filled their basement with boxes, bubble wrap,
plastic peanuts and other packaging materials, mostly salvaged from
other people's trash. Their family room is full of computer
equipment for posting merchandise and keeping track of sales.
</P>
<P>
   Many have invested in digital cameras, so they can show their
wares on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Some sellers have set up credit-card accounts and daily United
Parcel Service pickup. But the Wards like to keep things simple.
Ralph Ward makes a few runs to the post office and the UPS office
each week. And they still take checks, though they always wait for
the check to clear before shipping. Out of 1,000 sales, they've had
just two bounced checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, you know what kinds of people will give you
trouble, what the red flags are,'' said Ralph Ward. Buyers who want
to wriggle out of a deal often appear to be looking for faults in
the merchandise, or they may become overly particular about how and
when an item can be shipped, he said.

ANOTHER DELAY IN RUSSIAN COMPONENT OF SPACE STATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The crucial, Russian-fabricated third component of the
U.S.-led international space station faces another two-month delay,
a NASA spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The 43-foot-long service module, which will serve as the living
quarters for the first crews of astronauts and cosmonauts, has been
re-scheduled for a late November launching by the United States,
following a week of meetings in Moscow between top managers for the
project from the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   The new U.S. assessment is at odds with the more optimistic
Russian view. In statements to the ITAR-Tass news agency late last
week, Russian space agency chief Yuri Koptev predicted a September
liftoff for the module.
</P>
<P>
   The service module, for which NASA has no replacement, has been
chronically tardy because of financial difficulties in Russia
dating back to the 1993 U.S. invitation to the former Cold War
rival to join Europe, Japan and Canada in the massive undertaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask the Russians, `Can you meet a September launch
date? They would say, `Yes, with the proper funding,' '' said Kyle
Herring, a NASA spokesman for the station program. ``But the
reality is they have not been getting the proper funding.''
</P>
<P>
   Following Russia's addition to the station project, the
launching of the service module was targeted for April 1998. In
January, even with $60 million in payments for the United States
last fall, the Russians acknowledged a third slip in fabrication
and testing of the service module, placing the launch on Sept. 20,
1999.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the service module now appears by U.S. estimates to be
19 months late, a setback that has caused station costs to rise.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the disparity in launch date estimates, the Americans
and Russians have agreed to host a ``roll out'' ceremony for the
service module on April 26 as it leaves its testing laboratory at
the RSC-Energia plant in Moscow. The large module will then be
shipped by rail to the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, the
launch complex used by the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Following its arrival, a final round of components will be
installed, and the service module will undergo a last round of
pre-launch tests. It is the length of this phase of preparation
that NASA and the Russians are in disagreement over, Herring said.
</P>
<P>
   The first major components of the new station were launched late
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The series of meetings in Moscow has not changed previously
scheduled plans to launch the first crew to the outpost in late
January of next year. The team, led by American Bill Shepherd and
including cosmonauts Yuri Gidzenko and Sergei Krikalev, plans to
remain aboard for about six months.

CONGRESS RETURNS, LOOKING TO DEFINE 2000 CAMPAIGN WITH 1999
LEGISLATION
</HEADLINE>
   (ac) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Congress returned Monday, House Democrats
prepared an offensive against the House Republican leadership
intended to force a vote to overhaul campaign finance laws. At the
same time, House Republicans contemplated embracing an issue
traditionally championed by Democrats _ an increase in the minimum
wage.
</P>
<P>
   The jostling for position indicated that after the impeachment
trial of President Clinton, followed by weeks of relative silence
in Congress, the battle is about to intensify over which party
controls the political agenda, particularly in the narrowly divided
House. And as they struggle over a wide range of domestic concerns
from health-care policy, to tax cuts, to spending, to the shape of
the Social Security system, both parties face calculations about
which issues they want to promote, which they want to neutralize
and which they want to campaign on in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are trying to keep attention on four primary
themes this spring: Social Security, tax cuts, education and
national defense. Monday they reconciled minor differences in House
and Senate budget blueprints, and they planned to push through both
houses this week a budget that they say will wall off Social
Security payroll tax receipts so that they could not be diverted to
other uses. The budget plan for the 2000 fiscal year would also
make room for at least $15 billion in tax cuts next year, growing
to as much as $800 billion in tax cuts across the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   The budget is a policy blueprint that sets the guidelines for an
array of spending bills and tax-cutting legislation and a
monthslong struggle is expected with Clinton over the size of tax
cuts and the shape of domestic spending programs. Anticipating that
battle, congressional Republican leaders on Monday sought to rally
the public behind tax cuts at a town hall meeting in
Fredericksburg, Va., alongside Gov. James Gilmore, a Republican who
won election in 1997 by pledging to eliminate the state's unpopular
personal property tax on cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often in government there's competing philosophies,'' said
Rep. Thomas Davis, R-Va., who heads the House Republicans'
re-election effort. In a swipe at the Democrats, Davis said,
``There's one group in government that seems to believe that if it
moves tax it, if it keeps moving regulate it and if it stops moving
subsidize it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Republican plan to cut taxes, though walling off Social
Security money, would require stiff spending cuts that many of the
Republicans charged with writing the spending bills have complained
would prove too difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are pushing their own agenda including an increase in
the minimum wage, an array of education programs and an overhaul of
the campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   They also want to pass a measure that would put stricter
controls on health maintenance organizations and they are hoping to
be able to draw moderate Republicans to their side on some of these
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we're going to spend a lot of time getting a budget
done,'' said Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass. ``But we've had nothing on
health care, nothing on HMO reform. Really if the speaker wanted to
send a message he was going to work in a bipartisan way, the first
bill he would have considered is campaign finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year a coalition of House Republicans and Democrats managed
to overcome an array of obstacles put before them by the Republican
leadership and pass by a 252-179 vote a bipartisan campaign finance
bill sponsored by Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., and Meehan. The
measure, which died in the Senate, would ban the unregulated and
unlimited donations to political parties that were at the heart of
the campaign finance abuses in the 1996 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The new speaker, J. Dennis Hastert has indicated that while he
will allow a campaign finance debate this Congress, he does not
plan to take up the measure until all of the year's spending bills
are passed. But proponents of the Shays-Meehan bill want it passed
quickly so that there will be pressure on the Senate to act.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to force the issue to the House floor, Rep. Jim
Turner, D-Texas, said that a group of Democrats on Wednesday will
begin to collect signatures on a petition demanding a vote. It
takes the signatures of 218 House members to succeed. A key
question will be how many Republicans join the Democrats. ``I don't
know that I anticipate Republican members joining us immediately,''
said Turner. ``But I think the pressure will increase as the days
pass.''
</P>
<P>
   The House Republican leadership is showing more flexibility on
another measure usually associated with Democrats _ an increase in
the minimum wage. The Republicans' traditional allies in business
oppose the bill. But it is popular with the public and a number of
Republican moderates such as Rep. Jack Quinn, from upstate New
York, favor the measure, which means that it is likely to have the
votes to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Republican strategists say they are now considering
moving a minimum wage hike bill to the floor in the summer to
deprive Democrats of the potent issue. ``You get it on the floor
and get it off the floor as quickly possible,'' said a Republican
House strategist. ``Why drag it out and let them make a huge issue
out of it given the vote margin we have?''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats want to raise the minimum wage _ which is now
$5.15 an hour _ to $6.15 across two years. Quinn would raise it to
$6.15 over three years and index it for inflation in future years.
It was not clear what kind of increase the Republican leadership
would allow to the floor.

 Gene Therapy May Hold Hope for Hemophiliacs
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Tom Abate &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
Mark Ross was born without the gene his blood needs to clot.
Although he's never suffered a gushing wound, almost 40 years of
living with hemophilia have hobbled him.
</P>
<P>
   With every step, the weight of his torso has caused tiny leaks
in the blood vessels where his bones meet, and escaping blood has
gummed up his joints and destroyed their protective cartilage.
</P>
<P>
   ``My knees don't bend,'' said Ross, describing one of the
common, crippling side-effects of hemophilia. ``I walk with a cane,
sort of stiff-legged, like Frankenstein.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, this Palo Alto man could be among the first human
volunteers to test a genetic treatment for hemophilia, created by
Avigen Inc., a biotech startup in Alameda.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration soon could approve human
clinical trials of the drug. Provided it gets that OK, Avigen will
ask researchers at Stanford University Medical Center and
Children's Hospital of Philadelphia to inject nine hemophiliacs
with a harmless virus that has been altered to deliver the
blood-clotting gene they lack.
</P>
<P>
   Avigen's drug is based on gene therapy _ a promising technology
that has stubbornly refused to live up to its potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past decade, I've tracked more than 200 human gene
therapy trials, costing over a billion dollars, and I've yet to see
a single one cure a human disease,'' said Charles Engelberg, a
stock analyst with AmeriCal Securities in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   But Engelberg, an oncologist, believes that Avigen could break
the 10-year gene therapy jinx. ``I'm confident it's going to work
and be the first successful human gene therapy protocol,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  In theory, gene therapy is simple. Genes produce proteins,
the chemicals that perform every task in the body. If a person has
a disease caused by a missing or defective gene, giving the patient
the correct gene should enable the body to produce the protein
needed to cure the problem.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, however, gene therapy has flopped. The reasons have
varied. Some researchers tackled diseases like cancer that may have
several genetic causes. Other experiments failed when the immune
systems of patient volunteers attacked the viruses carrying the
gene therapies.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm Brenner, gene therapy research chief at Baylor College
of Medicine in Houston, said scientists think that Avigen could
succeed because it's aiming at a simple target.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what it takes to make blood clot, and we know
hemophiliacs don't have it,'' Brenner said. ``If Avigen's gene
therapy produces the clotting factor, it would be the sort of
unequivocal success that would boost the morale of the whole
field.''
</P>
<P>
   Blood clotting is a straightforward process, explained Mark Kay,
the Stanford researcher working with Avigen on the project.
</P>
<P>
   Most people have two proteins floating in their blood _ Factor 8
and Factor 9. When the body detects a leak in a blood vessel, &UR;  &LR; Kay
said, these two proteins rush to the scene and join forces to help
form a clot.
</P>
<P>
   But more than 15,000 living Americans were born without the gene
that produces either Factor 8 or Factor 9, which means their blood
won't clot.
</P>
<P>
   Kay said doctors have long been able to stop hemophiliacs from
bleeding by giving them infusions of blood or blood concentrates
that contain the missing clotting factors. Unfortunately, during
the past two decades, many hemophiliacs contracted HIV or Hepatitis
from contaminated blood.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, the biotech industry gave hemophiliacs their
first big break &UR;  &LR; when Baxter Healthcare Corp. won FDA approval for
a Factor 8 protein called Recombinate, made through recombinant DNA
technology.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the protein was ``brewed'' in huge metal vats in a
process akin to fermentation. This pure medicine could be injected
safely into hemophiliacs once or twice a week, without fear of
infection from tainted blood.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Genetics Institute won FDA approval for recombinant
Factor 9 protein called Refacto.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Avigen chief executive John Monahan said those factory-made
proteins were a great advance but fell short of a cure.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you take periodic injections, there are times when you
have plenty of clotting factor in your blood and other times when
you haven't enough,'' he said. Between injections, hemophiliacs can
suffer minor internal bleeding that, over time, can be crippling.
</P>
<P>
   Monahan said gene therapy puts the ``factory'' where nature
intended, inside cells.
</P>
<P>
   Cells essentially are protein production lines. Genes are the
factory bosses, telling the cells which proteins to produce. Put
the right gene into a hemophiliac's body, and their cells should
produce a steady supply of Factor 9 _ preventing not just
catastrophic gushers, but the intermittent bleeds between
injections.
</P>
<P>
   Like other gene therapy firms, Avigen proposes to deliver its
gene to the target cells by using a modified virus.
</P>
<P>
   Using a virus to treat a disease seems counterproductive. But
viruses do one thing well _ worm their way into cells. Most viruses
are made of two parts. Their outer shell, which does the burrowing,
is generally benign. It is only the inner core of the virus _ when
it contains harmful DNA _ that makes us sick.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; During the past decade, gene therapists have learned how to
scoop out that harmful DNA and replace it with a beneficial gene _
while preserving the outer shell that delivers the genetic payload
into cells.
</P>
<P>
   Avigen is using a relatively novel, harmless virus called
adeno-associated virus, or AAV, as its delivery vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   In lab and animal tests, AAV hasn't provoked the immune system
reactions that have caused the body to destroy other viral delivery
agents. The reason it hasn't been widely used in experiments until
now is that it is extraordinarily small, and scientists at firms
like Avigen and Cell Genesys in Foster City are only now learning
how to insert useful genes into this tiny package.
</P>
<P>
   Nadine Wong, editor of the BioTech Navigator, an Oregon
newsletter, called AAV ``probably the most popular (delivery)
system currently being developed.'' She named Avigen as ``a
leader'' in AAV work.
</P>
<P>
   Of course gene therapists have spent the past decade touting one
new virus after another. But Avigen convinced some skeptics that
AAV could succeed when it published the results of an animal
experiment in the January edition of the journal Nature Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Five hemophiliac beagles, deficient in Factor 9, received a
single injection of Avigen's gene therapy. Within two weeks, the
dogs's blood started to clot. Katherine High of Children's Hospital
of Philadelphia, who led the experiment, measured Factor 9 in their
blood. More than 17 months after that one injection, the dogs still
showed clotting ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made a career of insisting positive results in animals
don't always mean positive results in humans,'' said Engelberg, the
stock analyst. But Avigen's results wowed him because the dog
disease is so much like human hemophilia. ``What works in dogs
should work in humans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with that dog data, Avigen asked the FDA for permission to
give nine human hemophiliacs three different doses of its gene
therapy. It would inject the altered AAV into the rumps of
volunteers. If they respond like the dogs, the AAV would be
absorbed by a dime-sized swath of muscle cells around the
injection. Once in the cells, AAV's shell would dissolve and the
new gene should order those cells to pump out Factor 9.
</P>
<P>
   The tight-lipped FDA hasn't signalled whether it will approve
this human trial, but Avigen recently received the blessing of
another scientific body, which the FDA relies upon to review
cutting-edge gene therapy experiments.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The FDA asked the &UR;  &LR; Recombinant Advisory Committee of the
National Institutes of Health to consider whether one of Avigen's
altered AAV particles might ignore the muscle cells and migrate to
the patient's sperm cells, possibly causing a mutation that would
be passed on to any offspring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public and scientific community have been adamant that we
not alter cells that are passed from one generation to the next,''
said genetic scientist Estuardo Aguilar, a member of the NIH
committee. ``We decided this was an almost nonexistent probability
in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Avigen awaits FDA OK to test AAV in humans. Founded in
1992, and taken public in 1996, all the company's hopes ride on
making AAV the first gene therapy drug _ a risky process that will
take years. Avigen traded between $2 and $4 dollars in 1998. It
peaked at $8 in January on publication of the dog data. It since
has slipped, losing 19 cents Friday to close at $6.25.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ross, who is in a pool of potential test subjects, is
doing some soul-searching. He would like to volunteer for the
trials that Kay will conduct at Stanford, but he fears the
experiment could leave him worse off. Like many hemophiliacs who
contracted hepatitis from contaminated blood in the 1970s and
1980s, he's leery of scientific safety claims.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In the final analysis, he says he'll probably take the
experimental shot if given the chance _ not for himself, but for
his 13-year-old nephew Julian, who also has inherited the genetic
flaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too late to do me much good; I'm already bent over,''
Ross said. ``But if somebody like me doesn't take the test, we'll
never know if it works for the young people.''

IN NEW ROLE, VENEZUELA ARMY RUNS CLINICS AND SHOPS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ After decades in the background, the
Venezuelan military has begun playing a more active and prominent
role under a new president who is himself a former army colonel and
paratrooper. But it nevertheless came as a shock to Judith Gonzalez
to find soldiers selling meat and cheese out of the back of a truck
at a weekend market in her working-class neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles away, a team of military doctors was running a
medical clinic, delivering pediatric, gynecological and dental care
to residents of a slum neighborhood too poor to afford medical
care. Out in the countryside, meanwhile, other units of Venezuela's
120,000-strong military were building or repairing roads, sewers,
schools and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I would ever see the army doing this, but it
is welcome,'' Mrs. Gonzalez, a schoolteacher, said as she stood in
line at the market on a recent Saturday morning. ``Just the
presence of the military here inspires order and discipline, and
that is exactly what this country needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Venezuelans, however, view the military's newly enhanced
mission with alarm. President Hugo Chavez, who took office on Feb.
2 after winning 57 percent of the popular vote, led a failed coup
attempt in 1992, and his critics fear that he is now trying to
achieve by stealth what he could not accomplish by force of arms:
the militarization of a government that for more than 40 years has
been under civilian control.
</P>
<P>
   The news magazine Primicia, for instance, recently warned of a
surge of what it called ``military nationalism'' in a cover article
that also compared Chavez to the late Panamanian strongman Omar
Torrijos Herrera and Gen. Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt. Chavez, the
magazine wrote, ``is a proponent of linking the armed forces to
social tasks for the purpose of advancing `a revolution,''' that,
the magazine cautioned, comes ``with its ration of authoritarianism
included.''
</P>
<P>
   Since assuming office, Chavez has indeed appointed several
officers who joined him in the coup attempt to important government
posts. Colleagues from the military now serve as the minister of
transportation, governor of the Federal District, chief of the
federal Bureau of Taxation and director of the secret police.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, two other former coup plotters were elected
president of the Senate and governor of the important oil-producing
state of Zulia. Chavez has also appointed a pair of colonels still
on active duty to the board of directors of Petroleos de Venezuela,
the powerful government-owned oil company that the president has
criticized as ``a state within the state.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in his office at the same presidential palace
that he and fellow rebels tried to storm, Chavez, 44, played down
his reliance on his former colleagues, saying, ``The military
presence is minimal, not even reaching 1 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Technical capacity and leadership skills are what
have oriented the placement of some military officers in important
posts, so as to lead and to struggle against corruption and
incompetence.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez acknowledged that one purpose of the social works
program, called the Plan Bolivar 2000, is to improve the armed
forces' standing in the eyes of the people. The image of the
military was damaged a decade ago when, as he put it, ``a genocidal
government used the army against the people, to massacre the
people'' in quelling a popular uprising.
</P>
<P>
   But the main objective of the military's expanded role, Chavez
said, ``is to attend to the country's most urgent needs, the
necessities of housing, work, food, health, education and combating
corruption, since poverty is so exaggeratedly high.'' The army has
the manpower, equipment and other resources required for such an
effort, he said, and it would be wasteful not to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the strategy seems to be popular. In neighborhoods
where troops are now deployed and working with assistants hired
from the local civilian population, residents refer to them
affectionately as ``soldaditos,'' or ``little soldiers,'' and do
not hesitate to seek their advice when problems, ranging from
bureaucracy to crime, arise in their communities.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Eloy Vivas, for example, was looking forward to having the
military rebuild and recondition the school of which he is
principal. But, he said, he received a written directive from the
Ministry of Education ordering him ``not to allow any expansion or
improvements'' of his school, which has 650 pupils.
</P>
<P>
   So, Vivas said, he took the document to the chief of the army
battalion that is stationed in his slum neighborhood, Tacagua.
After conferring, they decided to ignore the Ministry's order and
plunge ahead with the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a miracle for us that they are even here,'' Vivas said
of the soldiers. ``We were without water here for three years, our
pleas completely ignored, so for somebody to tell me to turn help
away is completely absurd, ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have said that they plan to spend $12
million in public money on the social works program, which they
hope will be supplemented by donations from private enterprise. In
addition, members of civic groups and, to the suspicion of those
wary of the president's intentions, leaders of Chavez's Fifth
Republic Movement are working as volunteers on the more than 400
projects that are under way across this country of 23 million.
</P>
<P>
   The health and construction programs have been almost
universally welcomed, especially by the poor who are their main
beneficiary and the backbone of the president's support. But the
military-run ``people's markets'' have been more controversial,
despite the bargains they offer consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're damaging our livelihood and hurting our image,'' said
a butcher in the working-class neighborhood La Vega, where the army
has set up a weekend market that sells chicken, vegetables, cheese
and pasta at rock-bottom prices. ``We're not speculators, we're
just trying to make a living, and of course the army, with all its
resources, can sell products at prices cheaper than ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez said he was aware of the concerns stirred by the
military's more active role, and has taken steps to calm fears that
he plans to rule as a military strongman. Since being criticized
for wearing combat fatigues to one event, he has worn civilian
clothes, usually a business suit, at all his public appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, military jargon and habits continue to permeate
his daily routine. In speeches designed to rally the people to his
side, he often refers to ``battlefronts'' and ``taking to the
trenches'' to achieve his goals, which he and his supporters
maintain are being blocked by a corrupt Congress and a judiciary
beholden to traditional political parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the only resource that he can depend on,'' said a
general who works closely with the president. ``Some of us went to
the academy with him, others were his students, and still others
were his commanders or his subalterns. But we know him, and he
knows us, and that counts for a lot right now.''

   BAKU, Azerbaijan _ The new nations of the Caucasus and Central
Asia will take a giant step away from their former masters in
Moscow this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Several presidents and a host of other political and business
leaders are expected to gather on Saturday at the Georgian port of
Supsa for a ceremony opening a 515-mile pipeline that will carry
oil from the Caspian Sea. By opening the pipeline, they will
symbolically cut an old umbilical cord that has bound this region
to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in the region believe that oil is the key to their
prosperity, but until now all pipeline routes have led through
Russia. That has given Russia the power to control and even choke
the region's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   The new pipeline breaks this monopoly. It gives a profoundly
important new option to countries that are beginning to exploit the
vast oil reserves under and around the Caspian.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means the world to us,'' said Vafa Guluzade, chief
foreign-policy adviser to President Heydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan,
the center of the Caspian oil boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``This pipeline gives Caspian countries a reliable way to export
our oil without going through Russia. It is hugely important in an
economic sense, but it is even more important politically. Now, for
the first time, we have direct access to the West. We are freeing
ourselves from Russia after 200 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The new pipeline begins at Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, and
will carry 115,000 barrels of crude oil each day. After the oil
reaches Supsa, it will be loaded onto tankers that will carry it
across the Black Sea to the Mediterranean and to Western markets.
</P>
<P>
   Oil for the pipeline is being produced by a consortium of 11
companies from eight nations, including the United States. With the
addition of new pumping stations, and lubricants to make it flow
faster, the capacity of the line can be more than doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, oil from the consortium's undersea field has been
shipped out by rail and through an unreliable pipeline that snakes
north from Baku through the turbulent Russian republics of Chechnya
and Dagestan to Russia's Black Sea port of Novorossisk.
</P>
<P>
   The pipeline is intermittently closed by the separatist regime
in Chechnya, and shivering Russians who live along the way often
drill holes in it to divert oil for their needs.
</P>
<P>
   The new line has taken the consortium more than two years to
build and cost about $1.5 billion. At the peak of activity, more
than 3,000 people worked on it.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the oil companies, the most immediate beneficiaries of
the project will be Azerbaijan and Georgia, the two countries
through which it runs. Leaders of both countries complain that
Russia is trying to destabilize their fragile governments, and they
are eager to find new friends in the West.
</P>
<P>
   The Baku-Supsa pipeline will not be able to carry the large
amounts of oil that are expected to be produced by Caspian nations
in the coming years, though. Production is expected to exceed 1
million barrels a day by the end of the next decade. The United
States wants that oil to be exported through a pipeline that would
run from Azerbaijan across Georgia and Turkey to the Mediterranean,
but no contract has been signed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although most of the new Baku-Supsa pipeline runs underground,
there are security concerns. It runs near areas of Georgia where
separatists could pose a threat. Nonetheless, Georgian leaders are
as enthusiastic about it as their Azerbaijani counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a vitally important project for the entire region,
defining the region in the broadest sense as stretching from
Ukraine all the way to Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan,'' said Zurab
Zhvania, speaker of the Georgian Parliament. ``It gives us a chance
to connect ourselves to each other and to the world in a way that
keeps us free from political pressure or influence or manipulation
of any kind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a great deal to us,'' he continued, ``which is why
not everyone around us likes the idea. I'm talking about Russia,
but also about Iran. They are not happy, and I can understand why.
Actually, I think our enemies understand the importance of this
project better than our friends.''

   STANKOVIC, Macedonia _ Two hundred more Albanian refugees from
Kosovo crossed into Macedonia Monday, bringing with them fresh
accounts of an apparent Yugoslav effort to force Albanians out of
an area near Kosovo's border with Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav military forces have also been seen recently taking
defensive positions in the area, a Western diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   Such attacks and troop movements could be occurring throughout
Kosovo, the diplomat said, but the border area has major military
significance both for NATO and for the Kosovo Liberation Army, the
ethnic-Albanian separatist rebels.
</P>
<P>
   If NATO were to decide to use ground forces, an invasion of
Kosovo might include a thrust from Macedonia, across the border to
the southeast. And this border area is one possible route for the
rebels to smuggle weapons into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last week, Yugoslav forces have been expelling Kosovar
Albanians and taking up defensive positions on a far larger scale
along the border with Albania, to the southwest. The rebels have in
the past smuggled many of their supplies over the Albanian border.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees arriving Monday reported seeing Yugoslav army
convoys moving inside Kosovo. The convoys of tanks, jeeps and
trucks appeared to be rotating their positions to avoid NATO air
attacks, they said. Yugoslav soldiers are also sleeping in
residential areas, parking their vehicles there to avoid
bombardment, they said.
</P>
<P>
   All of the newly arrived refugees came here from the town of
Urosevac in southeastern Kosovo, about 30 miles from the border,
and they described a Yugoslav campaign to sweep Albanians out of
villages in the area over the last ten days. Their stories
dovetailed with accounts from the several hundred refugees who have
arrived here in sporadic groups since the Yugoslav forces
effectively sealed Kosovo's borders last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bislim Bebihu, a 32-year-old former traffic policeman, said
soldiers burned his village, Sojeve, which is near Urosevac, on
April 6 and killed his mother and father. He said he and his wife
and their son and three daughters fled to his aunt's house in the
town. Hiding indoors for the next ten days, he watched houses
burned and looted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really dangerous situation,'' he said. ``They are
shooting and harassing people, entering houses and taking whatever
they like.''
</P>
<P>
   Idriz Pergadini, a 47-year-old farmer who said his village,
Mirashe, was shelled a week ago, believed that only two villages
around Urosevac had not been burned by Yugoslav forces. Residents
of those gutted villages are hiding in the woods or in the town
itself, he said, and both groups are desperately short of food.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have anything to buy,'' he said. ``There was no
food, nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Pergadini and the other refugees who recently arrived said they
were not forced to leave the town. They said fear that they would
be killed and a lack of food drove them to take a 7:30 a.m. train
from Urosevac to the Macedonian border.
</P>
<P>
   There, instead of being robbed, threatened or turned back at the
border crossing as other refugees were last week, they were allowed
by Yugoslav border guards to walk into Macedonia, they said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bebihu estimated that 300 ethnic Albanians remain trapped in
the town of Urosevac.

 &HT;    Rescue effort critical for pilot, navigator
 &HT;    By Stacy Shelton and Milo Ippolito
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Boyd Clines steadied his helicopter less than 100
feet above a burning crane Monday to pull a stranded construction
worker to safety, it wasn't his first daring rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I joined the Army at 18 and I've been flying ever since,''
Clines, 52, of Douglasville, Ga., said.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Clines used the same techniques to pluck a
rafter stranded on an island in Sweetwater Creek floodwaters. But
probably the most harrowing flights the Arkansas native has made
were decades ago as a combat assault pilot in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of my rescues have been up in mountains or in jungles,
swamps and rivers,'' Clines said. ``In the army, I did a lot of
rescues of Special Forces teams in Laos and Cambodia.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cabbagetown fire was his ``first urban rescue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Downtown buildings are sort of like mountains. When the wind
comes through, it causes turbulence,'' Clines said.
</P>
<P>
   State officials gave equal credit to Clines' navigator on the
mission, Larry Rogers. It was Rogers who leaned out of the
helicopter, looking down to judge distances and guide Clines.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I did was look straight ahead,'' Clines said.
</P>
<P>
   Clines joined the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in
1979. He now regularly fights forest fires, and performs search and
rescue missions.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Clines had to do a particularly tricky piece of
flying. The winds were strong, and flames and smoke billowed up
from the five-story cotton mill. He had to fly within about 100
feet of the burning crane and keep the craft steady as a
firefighter was lowered by cable to the trapped worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we actually got (the firefighter) on the crane, I
thought, 'Well, this is going to work,' '' Clines said.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said he was not worried during the mission.
</P>
<P>
   Watching from another helicopter nearby, DNR Chief Pilot Michael
Thompson said it was ``good, good, good flying. . . I've been
flying 30 years and I was impressed. It was some piece of flying,
it really was.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those congratulating Clines Monday were Gov. Roy Barnes
and Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell. Both called to congratulate him.
</P>
<P>
   DNR Chief Pilot Michael Thompson,. who watched from another
helicopter, said it was ``good, good, good flying. I've been flying
30 years and I was impressed. It was some piece of flying, it
really was.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulton County Deputy Police Chief Steve Hogan, a friend of
Clines' watched the rescue on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I recognized his touch,'' Hogan said. ``I could tell
by watching that wasn't a rookie up there. Boyd and whoever that
fireman was hanging on that rope, yeah buddy, they earned their
money today.''

THESE WCC STARS CATCH THE EYE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pepperdine sophomore Dane Sardinha is one of the nation's top
catchers, but he might not be the best catcher in his own
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Loyola Marymount's Scott Walter, also a sophomore, was the West
Coast Conference's Player of the Year in 1998. Walter sets the
standard, Pepperdine coach Frank Sanchez said, because he has
already proved himself as an elite college player.
</P>
<P>
   They will be on the same field this weekend, when third-ranked
Pepperdine plays at LMU in an important three-game series. The
Waves (31-4) are 11-3 and in first place in the Coast Division. The
Lions (20-16) are 9-5 and leading the West Division, one game ahead
of St. Mary's.
</P>
<P>
   Sardinha, one of the most sought-after prospects in the nation
as a senior in high school, made two unexpected decisions before he
even played a game at Pepperdine.
</P>
<P>
   First, he surprisingly chose the Waves over perennial powerhouse
Miami. He said he made his decision based on ``location and
coaching.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I also like being with the underdog team,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sardinha, who went to high school in Hawaii, also spurned the
Kansas City Royals after they made him a second-round pick in the
'97 amateur draft. He wanted a signing bonus of more than $1
million, but the Royals wouldn't go over $750,000 and the
negotiations broke down.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals, like every team, loved Sardinha's defense. He has a
strong arm _ he once picked off a runner from his knees _ and
Pepperdine pitcher Brad Tucker admires the way Sardinha ``frames''
pitches to get a strike call on a pitch that is out of the strike
zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``(He) is just a natural, gifted catcher,'' Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, Sardinha has improved from last year, when he hit
13 home runs but only batted .263. He's batting .382 with seven
homers and his total of 36 RBI is just two behind all of last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was widely publicized that he potentially was one of the
elite catchers in the country as a high school guy,'' Sanchez said.
``We typically try to stay away from guys that are going to turn
pro. With Dane, we knew it was a gamble. We came out smelling like
a rose.''
</P>
<P>
   LMU head coach Frank Cruz, Sanchez's former staff-mate at USC,
had a similar situation with Walter. The Dodgers drafted Walter in
the 16th round out of Loyola High and then offered him $375,000 to
sign. Walter held firm to his commitment to Cruz and the Lions, who
hadn't finished above .500 since 1991 and were coming off a 21-39
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been a dream of mine to play college baseball,''
Walter said. ``I thought that it would be a worthwhile experience.
I wouldn't have made a different decision, looking back on it. Not
at all. I'm having a great time.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's having his second straight outstanding season. He leads
the Lions with a .383 average and has seven homers and 33 RBI. Last
year, he batted .383 with eight homers and 67 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Staying the course: Cal State Northridge freshman shortstop
J.T. Stotts was given the option to redshirt the season a month ago
when his broken left foot was in a cast.
</P>
<P>
   Stotts and his parents decided against it.
</P>
<P>
   That judgment proved to be wise. Stotts, who batted .395 in 13
games with the Matadors before the injury, returned to action
Sunday at UCLA and singled in his first at-bat before the game was
rained out.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he expects to be rusty when CSUN plays a three-game
series at Washington this weekend, being hurt wasn't a total loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've learned a lot just by watching,'' he said. ``I've
also been in the weight room, getting stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Stotts was turning into one of the Matadors' best players before
he got hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Stotts' injury) was a real big thing that hurt us,'' senior
right-hander Jim DeBiase said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Another loss: When USC All-American catcher Eric Munson
went down with a broken hand on March 27, freshman Beau Craig
returned to the position where he was an all-state player in high
school.
</P>
<P>
   Craig, one of the nation's top recruits and an outstanding
defensive catcher, was more than a capable replacement; he was in
the lineup every game as the starting third baseman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good one,'' USC coach Mike Gillespie said of Craig.
``He's a very good throwing catcher. I don't think he's overmatched
or overwhelmed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Craig is also hurt. He strained a muscle on his right side
lifting weights. Gillespie calls it a ``very unusual injury.''

   CLINTON-CONTEMPT (Washington) _ Judge Webber Wright finds
President Clinton in civil contempt for his lies in the Paula Jones
civil deposition. She wrote: ``It is difficult to construe the
president's sworn statements ... as anything other than a willful
refusal to obey this court's discovery orders.'' The judge said,
``The record demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the
president responded to plaintiffs' questions by giving false,
misleading and evasive answers that were designed to obstruct the
judicial process.'' By John M. Broder.

   MCDOUGAL-TRIAL (Little Rock, Ark.) _ A federal jury today
acquitted Susan H. McDougal of obstructing justice for her refusal
to testify before a grand jury about the Arkansas financial
dealings of President Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
But the jury, in its third day of deliberations, deadlocked on two
other counts of criminal contempt and the judge, George Howard Jr.,
declared a mistrial. Although the jury's action was a mixed result,
it amounted to a setback for Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel
for Whitewater matters who Ms. McDougal claimed was out to get

in cooperation with the PBS program Frontline, has found him to be

the natural flow of water that once stretched in a continuous sheet
from Lake Okeechobee to Florida Bay. Now, in the nation's most
ambitious attempt at ecological restoration, the Federal and state
governments are about to try to put things right. The idea is to
spend some $8 billion over the next 20 years to re-plumb the

TO EXPAND NATO ATTACKS, U.S. TO SEND 300 MORE WARPLANES TO
YUGOSLAVIA
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: 2nd take will move within 30 minutes.)  
(ac) 
 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO's senior commander, Gen. Wesley K. Clark,
Monday asked the Pentagon to contribute about 300 more warplanes to
the fight against Yugoslavia, in what would make possible a rapid
and strident expansion of NATO's attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The request, which officials said would be approved, will
increase the number of American and NATO aircraft committed to the
campaign to nearly 1,000, more than double the number _ 430 _ the
alliance had on hand when it began the the first strikes on March
24.
</P>
<P>
   For the United States, the latest increase _ a 60 percent jump
in warplanes _ significantly deepens the nation's involvement in
the war. The addition almost certainly means that the Air Force
will have to call up a number of reservists to provide crews for
all the aircraft, particularly the aerial refuelers, a senior
defense official said.
</P>
<P>
   While Pentagon and NATO officials have portrayed the raids on
Yugoslavia as successful, despite foul weather, the rapid buildup
underscores the limits of their impact on Yugoslavia's forces. With
the Clinton administration and NATO still adamantly ruling out the
use of ground forces, Clark's only option is an intensification of
air power.
</P>
<P>
   And as the air campaign moves into its third week, NATO
commanders have expressed their frustration at the Serbian military
force's entrenched, elusive positions. In recent days, NATO and
Pentagon officials have tried to prepare the public for several
weeks more of air strikes, a campaign that military officials
insist can cripple Serbian's military over a sustained period of
time.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels Monday, at the first gathering of NATO foreign
ministers since the bombing began, they pledged to keep up the air
attacks but at the same time searched for the shape of a political
settlement in Kosovo and urged Russia to be part of it.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's request came only two days after the Pentagon announced
that it had approved an earlier request for 82 more planes,
including F-16's designed to destroyed air-defenses and refuelers.
The officials declined to specify the exact number and type of
aircraft in his latest request but said they included both combat
and support planes, including F-15's and A-10's designed to go
after targets on the ground and still more refuelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to focus more heavily on the Yugoslav Army and
special police forces on a 24-hour basis,'' the senior defense
official said, speaking on  &UR; the  &LR; condition of anonymity.

TECHNOLOGY SHARES ASIDE, STOCKS RALLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks rebounded from a decline in big technology
shares early Monday and ended the session soaring to new records,
as investors began to shift their attention to market sectors that
have underperformed.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp rise in prices came as a surprise to many analysts and
traders. Most market professionals had expected a rocky session
following Compaq Computer Corp.'s announcement after the market
closed on Friday that its first-quarter profits would be less than
half of what analysts had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Market averages did drop sharply at the opening, and computer
and other big technology companies remained under pressure
throughout the day. But buyers outside the technology sector soon
asserted themselves, setting the stage for what became a broad
rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today surprised everybody,'' said Richard Bernstein, chief
quantitative strategist at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. ``Anyone who says
they expected this to happen is a fibber.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up a robust 165.67 points,
or 1.63 percent, to 10,339.51, its first close above 10,300.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index gained 10.29 points, or
nearly 0.8 percent, to 1,358.64, a new closing high. The Nasdaq
composite index, which contains many technology issues, even
managed to eke out a gain, rising 5.76 points, to a closing high of
2,598.81.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks, which has
trailed other market indicators for nearly a year, rose 6.46
points, or 1.6 percent, to 412.32.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that money can come out of what has been the
strongest group and have it flow into other areas shows that the
game is still intact,'' said Michael Clark, head of U.S. stock
trading at Credit Suisse First Boston. ``And the market's improved
breadth is a healthy sign.''
</P>
<P>
   For a day at least, investors who have ridden technology stocks
to their current lofty heights seemed to conclude that the Compaq
announcement cast a cloud over first-quarter results for other
companies that make either personal computers or their components.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq was severely punished. The stock fell 6 7/8 a share, or
more than 22 percent, to 24 1/16. It was by far the most heavily
traded issue on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday, with more
than 111.3 million shares changing hands.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq's announcement was not seen as good news for other big
technology companies, either. IBM fell 2 7/8 a share, to 183 7/16,
and Hewlett Packard lost 1\, to 68 3/8.
</P>
<P>
   Intel, which is expected to report its first-quarter results
after the market closes Tuesday, fell 4 1/8 a share, to 61\. Lucent
Technologies dropped 4 3/16, to 59 7/16. Microsoft was down 1\, to
93. EMC lost 4 5/16, to 130 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology is going to have problems, but I am not sure those
problems will last long,'' said John Manley, equity strategist at
Salomon Smith Barney. ``I think we are late in the game for
technology, but it is such a high-quality group that the risk of
writing its epitaph prematurely exists.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as worries about earnings were pushing investors out of big
technology stocks, they were snapping up shares of Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought a key indicator of what would happen in the wake of
the Compaq announcement would be the behavior of Internet stocks,''
said William Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald.
``That is a group where you don't have to worry about earnings
announcements.''
</P>
<P>
   After slumping at the opening, Internet stocks surged. By the
close Thestreet.com's Internet index had gained 58.44 points, or 8
percent, to a new record of 790.37.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, optimism about first-quarter earnings helped to
increase prices of shares in finance, drug and heavy-equipment
companies.
</P>
<P>
   American Express led the Dow index higher, rising 7, to 135 3/8.
General Electric gained 4 5/16, to 116{, a new 52-week high.
Caterpillar gained 2 5/8, to 51 3/8, after an analyst at Merrill
Lynch raised his long-term rating on the company.
</P>
<P>
   Among drug stocks, Merck gained 1} a share, to 85, and Pfizer
rose 4 1/8, to 150 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   Among financial-service companies, Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette
jumped 8 a share, to 94. Merrill Lynch gained 1 13/16, to 99 15/16.
And Charles Schwab rose 9, to 135; since the start of the year, the
stock has gained more than 140 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with recent Mondays, the trading activity on Monday was
quite brisk. Volume on the Big Board was 810.8 million shares. On
the Nasdaq, 1.1 billion shares changed hands.

 &HT;    Neighbors hope for 'speedy' recovery in Cabbagetown
 &HT;    By S.A. Reid and Kim Byrd
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Cabbagetown was a melting pot of emotions Monday as
residents watched the spectacular fire gut the historic Fulton Bag
and Cotton Mill lofts , the biggest symbol of their Southeast
Atlanta neighborhood's quiet rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   The smoke and fire fanned feelings ranging from disbelief that
such an important project would suffer a setback of this magnitude,
to anger by some who say the blaze was a tragedy waiting to happen.
</P>
<P>
   A common thread, however, is concern about the fire's cause,
whether it could have been prevented or has any possible connection
to long-smoldering complaints about the project by community and
mill residents.
</P>
<P>
   These hot button issues most likely will dominate today's
Cabbagetown Neighborhood Improvement Association meeting scheduled
for 7 p.m. at the Salvation Army's Boy's and Girl's Club, where the
fire forced the evacuation of 20 children Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, no one would have wished this to happen. We hope
recovery will be speedy and damage minimal,'' said Gerry Weber,
CNIA president. ``What we expect is that there will be a thorough
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   One community concern is the perception of some that mill and
its residents have been slow to integrate into the neighborhood.
Mills residents themselves have their own set of complaints about
shoddy construction and missing amenities that prompted them to
petition for a management change.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the complaints, city officials, neighborhood leaders and
residents credit the mill as a positive addition but say the
marquee project isn't the only thing Cabbagetown has going for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been real neat to watch it (the mill) being built,'' said
Lisa Shinault who rushed from her job at downtown's Apparel Mart to
rescue her cat ``chickey.'' A lot of neat people have moved into
the neighborhood. There are a lot of cool things that are suppose
to happen, and I think they will still happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But Peggy Williams, director of the Cabbagetown Revitalization
and Future Trust, sees the picture as a little less rosy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're real fortunate we didn't lose any more houses,'' said
Williams whose community land trust organization has renovated 50
homes during the past decade on Carroll and Savannah streets.
</P>
<P>
   `` What can you say. It's devastating. I just feel for the
people I saw walking up and seeing their houses burn.''

NATO HITS REFINERY, CAR FACTORY, AIRPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES AND LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite bad weather, NATO unleashed a flurry of
attacks Monday on Yugoslavia, targeting its biggest oil refinery,
the factory that makes Yugo cars, and Pristina's Slatina airport.
An allied missile intended for a railroad bridge in southeast
Serbia hit a passenger train, killing at least 10 people and
injuring 16.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, fighting on the Kosovo-Albania border between Serb
forces and Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas entered its fourth
day. Albania said it would accept the deployment of extra NATO
troops to augment the 8,000 soldiers due to arrive soon to help
provide aid for refugees fleeing Kosovo and to secure Albanian's
borders.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, NATO foreign ministers, meeting for the first time
since the nearly three-week-old air campaign began, presented a
united front against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, saying
the airstrikes had taken a toll on the Serb army and security
forces and vowing to press ahead until he accepts the alliance's
terms for ending the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials reported scores of casualties and injuries
from the 20th day of NATO attacks, including the train deaths and
three others who died in an attack on a car near the Kosovo capital
of Pristina. And as darkness fell Monday, air raid sirens went off
in Belgrade, Nis, Kragujevac and Podgorica, heralding another night
of air strikes. A few hours later, Yugoslav anti-aircraft defense
systems fired at NATO planes flying over Belgrade, state news
reported.
</P>
<P>
   In other developments Monday:
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX) The Yugoslav parliament voted to join an alliance with
Russia and Belarus _ a move apparently designed to try to get a
reluctant Russia to stop the NATO airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX) Pentagon officials said the first of 24 Apache
helicopters could arrive in Albania later this week to join the
NATO strike force, increasing substantially the alliance's ability
to destroy Serb tanks and troops.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX) Defense Secretary William S. Cohen said there was no
consensus in the United States or in NATO for the introduction of
ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force Major General Charles Wald said cloudy and rainy skies
once again compromised NATO strikes over the weekend, a situation
likely to remain for several days. But, he added, bombs rained down
on at least two dozen targets anyway, as the allies pulled out
their all-weather weaponry and hit sites across Kosovo and Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, allied warplanes struck Yugoslavia's biggest oil
refineries, the airport in Pristina, and again hit the Yugo car
factory, which is housed in a complex that also makes weapons.
Serbia's second-largest city, Novi Sad, where two major bridges
were damaged early in the air campaign, also was hit again.
</P>
<P>
   In the train incident, a missile hit the second coach, and three
other cars caught fire and derailed, according to Yugoslavia's
state-run Tanjug news agency. The report said the train was bound
from Belgrade to Salonika, Greece.
</P>
<P>
   NATO issued a statement saying it had hit a rail bridge that was
an important military supply line and had taken ``extraordinary
measures to avoid collateral casualties'' during the airstrikes.
But ``regrettably, we cannot exclude the possiblity of casualties
in this instance.''
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, Cohen said the United States had learned of Serbs
deserting from combat units in Kosovo and of a growing effort by
young Yugoslavs to evade being called up by the reserves.
</P>
<P>
   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said, ``Our operations are
taking a heavy toll of President Milosevic's army and security
forces. We are tightening the screw on those forces in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Along Yugoslavia's border with Albania, fighting between Serb
forces and Kosovo rebels was reportedly intensifying. The Tanjug
news agency claimed at least 150 rebels were killed in a border
clash.
</P>
<P>
   Albania, struggling to cope with an influx of some 300,000
Kosovar Albanian refugees forced to flee their homes by Serb
soldiers and police, asked for NATO assistance to help prevent
further attacks against its territory.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to speed up the humanitarian relief effort, the US
Navy for the first time began using helicopters to deliver food,
water, tents and other supplies from Tirana, the Albanian capital,
to an area near the Kosovo border.
</P>
<P>
   Using the helicopters will allow relief workers to deliver
supplies four times as fast to 260,000 refugees in 11 Albanian
camps.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, Yugoslavia's parliament voted to join an
alliance with Russia and Belarus _ an effort regarded as an attempt
to draw Russia into the military conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Russia favors the idea of incorporating Yugoslavia into its
alliance but said membership wouldn't be granted immediately, and
military aid would not be automatic.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, who is scheduled to
meet Tuesday with Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov in Oslo,
Norway, said she would seek ``common ground'' on the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Two New England Air National Guard refueling tankers have been
sent to Europe to support NATO forces. The two KC-135 tankers,
three air crews and a small group of maintenance workers from the
101st Refueling Wing left Bangor, Maine, over the weekend to take
part in Operation Allied Force, Col. William I. Smith, the wing
commander, said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   And, after a much-criticized delay, the Pentagon announced
Monday that the first of 24 low-flying, high-performing Apache
helicopters could arrive in Albania this week to enhance NATO's
airpower and ability to strike tank columns and troops loyal to
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have accused the Pentagon of moving too slowly to deploy
the Apaches, considered one of the most lethal aircraft in the
world and one of the most effective at destroying targets such as
the Yugoslavian army units.
</P>
<P>
   However, NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said: ``Let me not give the
impression _ which I think would be erroneous _ that the Apaches
are somehow the 7th Cavalry arriving on the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   The US Army is shifting 2,500 support troops equipped with radar
detectors and missile launchers to protect and cover the Apaches
that will be based in Tirana. Many observers say this move
represents the closest involvement of US ground forces in the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Senators John McCain, a Republican from Arizona who is on the
Armed Services Committee, and Joseph Biden, a Democrat from
Delaware who is on the Foreign Relations Committee, Monday
circulated nearly identical resolutions that would give President
Clinton ``the authority to use all necessary force'' to meet NATO's
goals in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But Cohen sought to quell any clamor in Congress for ground
troops. He said NATO's military brass ``has indicated they do not
believe it is necessary... and have not requested it. And so any
consideration for ground troops is something for the future, and we
do not believe is necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   With an estimated 700,000 refugees inside Kosovo and at risk of
starvation and death, the NATO ministers meeting in Brussels
considered for the first time establishing the province as a
protectorate as a way to shield it from the Yugoslav military.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was discussed during a closed session of the North
Atlantic Council as part of plan to support autonomy for Kosovar
Albanians after the conflict is settled and the refugees returned.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said that although NATO was not considering cutting
Kosovo out of the Yugoslavian federation, the foreign ministers
considered ``some kind of international protective status'' for the
region.
</P>
<P>
   Such a protectorate would allow the 1.8 million Kosovar
Albanians living in the province before the airstrikes to have ``a
high degree of self-government without the threats and terror that
they have been living under,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, however, ruled out arming the rebel Kosovo Liberation
Army. NATO also announced that Milosevic would not be allowed to
maintain any military presence in Kosovo as a condition for peace.

JUDGE SAYS CLINTON LIED, FINDS CONTEMPT

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge Monday found President Clinton in
civil contempt of court for lying in a deposition about the nature
of his sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica S.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a January 1998 deposition in the Paula Jones sexual
harassment case, swore that he did not have a sexual relationship
with Lewinsky. Clinton later explained that he did not believe he
had lied in the case because the type of sex he had with Lewinsky
did not fall under the definition of sexual relations used in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   But US District Judge Susan Webber Wright, who presided over the
deposition, said in her ruling Monday that Clinton lied to her and
to Jones's attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The record demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that
the president responded to plaintiffs' questions by giving false,
misleading and evasive answers that were designed to obstruct the
judicial process,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   Wright ordered Clinton to pay Jones's legal expenses, which
could be hundreds of thousands of dollars, and she sent her finding
to the Arkansas bar, which could disbar Clinton. Clinton does not
face possible jail time because the contempt citation was issued in
a civil, not criminal, case.
</P>
<P>
   The contempt finding provided a measure of victory for House
Republicans who voted to impeach the president partly on grounds
that he committed perjury in the case. After the House voted for
impeachment, the Senate could not come up with the necessary 67
votes to convict Clinton and oust him from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly now have a federal judge putting the president of
the United States in contempt for lying under oath, for committing
perjury,'' Senator Bob Smith, a New Hampshire Republican who is
running for president, said in an interview. ``That further
justifies the right vote to remove.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Wright's decision is a long-overdue victory for the rule
of law,'' said Republican National Committee chairman Jim
Nicholson. ``It is a vindication of those who have known all along
that President Clinton committed perjury and obstruction of
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Bob Barr, the Georgia Republican who first called
for Clinton's impeachment, said on CNN that the ruling was
``vindication'' of his effort but was not grounds for reopening the
impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Senior presidential aides, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Clinton lawyers regarded the penalty as minimal since the
judge had the option of citing the president for criminal contempt.
But the lawyers were keeping options open until they learn how
large a monetary penalty Jones might seek, the aides said.
</P>
<P>
   During his deposition in the Jones case, Clinton was surprised
when Jones's lawyers asked him whether he had sex with Lewinsky.
``I have never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky,'' Clinton
responded. He also said that he couldn't recall being alone with
her in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Clinton's aides said that the president had oral sex with
Lewinsky, and they contended that this did not fall within the
definition of sexual relations used in the Jones case. The
definition, for example, said that sexual relations includes ``an
intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person'' and
contact with body areas such as breasts.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, who originally signed an affidavit saying she did not
have sexual relations with Clinton, eventually testified before the
grand jury that he did touch her body in areas that fell within the
definition of sexual relations.
</P>
<P>
   After prosecutors obtained a dress from Lewinsky that contained
Clinton's DNA material, the president testified before the grand
jury that he had an ``inappropriate relationship'' with Lewinsky,
but he declined to describe the sexual nature of the relationship.
Clinton's lawyers later said during the impeachment hearings that
the president had come close to the line of lying, but had not
stepped over it.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, who had indicated in a footnote to a September ruling
that she had doubts about the truth of Clinton's testimony, said
Monday: ``It is difficult to construe the president's sworn
statements . . . as anything other than a willful refusal to obey
this court's discovery orders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply put, the president's deposition testimony regarding
whether he had ever been alone with Ms. Lewinsky was intentionally
false and his statements regarding whether he had ever engaged in
sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky likewise were intentionally
false,'' Wright wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Little Rock, Ark.-based judge, who gave Clinton 30 days to
appeal the ruling, ordered that Clinton pay $1,202 to cover her
travel expenses for the Washington deposition on Jan. 17, 1998. She
gave Jones's attorney 20 days to submit legal expenses in the case,
which Clinton would be required to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Wright dismissed Jones's sexual harassment complaint last year.
Clinton, rather than risk a successful appeal by Jones, paid the
former Akransas state worker $850,000 to drop the case. It is
likely that Clinton's legal defense fund, which is collecting money
to pay for the president's defense in his impeachment case, would
pay the costs associated with Monday's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph diGenova, a Republican and former federal prosecutor,
said Monday that Wright's action underscored the depth of Clinton's
untruthful testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an extremely serious penalty,'' diGenova said. ``It
reflects the degree to which the judge was personally offended by
the president's mendacity and manipulative behavior. For the
president of the United States, who is a lawyer, to be held in
contempt and have that referred to his state bar association for
possible additional sanction, that is a very serious matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Wright, in her ruling, referred to the historic nature of her
decision, but added: ``The court takes no pleasure whatsoever in
holding this nation's president in contempt of court.''

FLEET FIRST BANK TO SPONSOR MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL

<P>
   BOSTON -- Fleet Financial Group Monday became a national sponsor
of Major League Baseball, announcing an agreement said to be worth
$4 million to $6 million over three years.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first such national marketing deal between a bank and
any of the four major sports leagues, officials and observers said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their cousins in the more nationally based financial
services and insurance industries, banks _ traditionally regional
or local entities _ have not pursued national sports sponsorships.
But Fleet's recently announced intention to merge with BankBoston
made sponsoring the Major Leagues more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes even more sense now, having announced our intentions
with BankBoston,'' said Terrence Murray, Fleet's chairman and chief
operating officer. ``We are even more of a national bank with
national customers. Sponsoring Major League Baseball is more
evidence of how willing we are to play at that level.''
</P>
<P>
   But to create exclusivity, Fleet and Major League Baseball had
to squeeze into a niche adjacent to another Boston institution, the
John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. Hancock is the exclusive
sponsor of Major League Baseball in the financial services
category.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of this deal, Fleet will either be seen as the brave
pioneer among banks in national sports sponsorships, or it will be
seen as having paid too much for a category that is now too
narrow,'' said Lance Helgeson, editor of the IEG Marketing Report,
in Chicago. ``But my sense is that they did well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like Fleet, more and more banks are expanding and that
means their marketing areas are growing, too,'' Helgeson said. ``So
there's a sense out there that other banks may well follow Fleet
into this area.''
</P>
<P>
   The positioning of the banking and financial services categories
in Major League Baseball may be especially crucial for Hancock. Its
president and chief operating officer, David D'Alessandro, has said
that, given his much-publicized displeasure with the International
Olympic Committee, he is reviewing whether to pull the Olympic
sponsorship dollars _ and he may decide to put them on baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Major League Baseball is my ace in the hole,'' D'Alessandro
said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet officials said Hancock's sponsorship was part of the
consideration between the negotiators for the bank and Major League
Baseball. Observers said it likely lowered, at least somewhat, the
value and cost of the Fleet sponsorship.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Finucane, Fleet's senior vice president and director of
corporate marketing and communications, said the bank will not
adverstise any of its investment services, through the baseball
sponsorship, because that is deemed part of Hancock's category.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did what we could to accommodate Fleet, while not taking
away from Hancock,'' said Derrick Johnson, a spokesman for Major
League Baseball. ``We think there is plenty of room for both the
financial services category and a bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball and bank officials declined to release the terms of the
deal, which were provided by sports industry observers like
Helgeson.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet officials say they will leverage the new sponsorship with
a major marketing campaign, including television, radio, print,
outdoor, in-stadium, and public-transit advertising. The campaign
theme will be: ``Fleet Keeps Baseball Going.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleet last year arranged a $425 million credit deal with Major
League Baseball, among the largest ever in sports-related
financing. It is used by participating teams, in part, to refinance
existing debt. Fleet does banking with 12 of the 30 Major League
franchises, and is a sponsor of both the Boston Red Sox and the New
York Yankees. It also has relationships with sports-related vendors
who manufacture equipment, build stadiums, and provide concessions,
bank officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet used the announcement at Fenway Park Monday to show off
its new advertising sign on the right field wall and to also
announce that it will sponsor the 1999 Major League All-Star Game,
to be played at Fenway in July.
</P>
<P>
   The bank also announced a new endorsement agreement with Red Sox
shortstop Nomar Garciaparra. Garciaparra will work with a variety
of community service groups catering to youth on behalf of the
bank.
</P>
<P>
   When Garciaparra asked Murray to play catch with him, as a way
of welcoming the bank to Major League Baseball, Murray smiled,
blushed, and seemed every bit as happy as any kid given the same
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember being a boy and catching the train from Woonsocket,
R.I., to come up to Fenway with my friends,'' said Murray, who once
played left field for Harvard, as he adjusted his glove. ``So this
is a real treat.''

   BOGOTA, Colombia _ A passenger plane with 46 people aboard was
hijacked Monday by suspected leftist rebels and forced to land at a
clandestine airstrip in northern Colombia, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers and crew disappeared after armed men herded them
into boats on a nearby river, said air force Gen. Hector Fabio
Velasco. Among the passengers was a Colombian congressman.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were people in civilian clothes and some in uniform
directing the passengers down to the river,'' Velasco said.
</P>
<P>
   The twin-engine Fokker-50 aircraft was operated by Avianca,
Colombia's largest airline. Flight 9463, with 41 passengers and
five crew members aboard, was scheduled to make the short hop from
the northern city of Bucaramanga to the Colombian capital of
Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   The plane took off at 10:32 a.m. and disappeared shortly
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   At first, officials feared an accident. But the aircraft was
spotted about three hours later at an airstrip near the town of
Simiti, 225 miles north of Bogota in Bolivar state. Private pilots
flying over the area reported seeing a large group of people
boarding boats.
</P>
<P>
   Ernesto Huertas, director of Colombia's civil aviation
authority, said police visited the scene and ``found the plane, but
there were no passengers or crew.''
</P>
<P>
   The remote jungle area is infested with leftist rebels as well
as right-wing paramilitary death squads. Army Gen. Rafael Hernandez
Lopez said that police and army troops were combing the region.  &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Radionet of Bogota reported that police intelligence agents
believed the crime may have been a joint operation of Colombia's
two main rebel groups _ the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia,
known as the FARC, and the smaller National Liberation Army, or the
ELN.
</P>
<P>
   The FARC and the ELN have funded their 35-year war against the
government, in part, by kidnapping prominent Colombians and
foreigners and by demanding huge ransom payments. They usually
carry out their kidnappings at highway roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia has the highest rate of kidnappings in the world. Last
year, the guerrillas were blamed for 1,385 of the 2,216 kidnappings
reported in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The abductions have continued even though the FARC and the
Colombian government opened peace talks in January. Last month,
FARC commandos kidnapped and executed three Americans who were
working with one of Colombia's indigenous groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that the guerrillas reflect'' on their behavior, said
Sabas Pretelt, a member of the National Peace Commission, which is
advising the government on negotiations with the rebels. ``Grabbing
50 or 60 people cannot be pardoned, even by God.''
</P>
<P>
   A new round of peace talks between the FARC and the government
is scheduled to begin next week.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's hijacking was the first of a Colombian commercial
aircraft in 12 years. Many Colombians rely on air travel, even for
short distances, because guerrilla roadblocks are so common.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers on the Avianca flight included Juan Manuel Corzo,
a Conservative Party congressman, as well as the major of the town
of Zulia and the president of a state-run natural gas company.
Several women, children and elderly people were also on board.
</P>
<P>
   Marta Flores, the sister of one passenger, said her brother
suffers from pulmonary problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in very delicate shape,'' Flores said. ``It's impossible
for him to endure something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   In January, a top FARC commander threatened to kidnap Colombian
lawmakers unless they passed a prisoner-exchange law. The FARC is
holding about 300 police and army troops and wants to exchange them
for 450 jailed rebels.

 &HT;    Cotton mill fire: The moment that stopped Atlanta's heart
 &HT;    By Craig Schneider
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As five-story flames roared through a massive piece of
Atlanta history, it was the human drama _ one man risking his life
to save another; a swooping, dangling rescue on the crest of an
inferno _ that enthralled people Monday.
</P>
<P>
   All Atlanta watched in stunned amazement for 90 minutes as
trapped construction worker Ivers Sims, perched on a wind-blown
crane 250 above the ground, waited as the flames grew higher and
higher, closer and closer.
</P>
<P>
   And then in soared firefighter Matt Moseley, clamped
precariously to a 50-foot rope below a helicopter, looking like
some superhero thrust from comic book into real life.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 3 p.m. on a balmy day, people in offices and homes
seemed to stop everything as two men's lives hung in the balance of
a heart-stopping drama. Hung by the thread of narrow cord.
</P>
<P>
   With flames from the Fulton Bag and Cotton Mill licking at their
heels, Moseley landed on the crane's arm and maneuvered to the far
end, where, through the intense heat, he cracked a joke. He told
Sims he had been sent to tell him he could knock off early.
</P>
<P>
   With that, the firefighter strapped the man into a harness and
they held onto each other as the helicopter swept away from the
conflagration, over treetops and cars and people watching amazed
from byways, bridges and buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The Cabbagetown community of southeast Atlanta may have lost a
treasured bit of its past, but the perfectly executed courage of a
firefighter reminded people that some things transcend buildings
and history, that in an age when real-life heros seem as elusive as
smoke, ordinary men can sometimes work magic.
</P>
<P>
   They landed out of harm's way, on the green grass. Sims walked
to a stretcher. People applauded as he was wheeled to an ambulance.

JUDGE HOLDS CLINTON IN CONTEMPT FOR HIS TESTIMONY IN PAULA JONES
CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER and NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge on Monday held President Clinton in
contempt of court for willfully providing false testimony under
oath about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky in the sexual
misconduct lawsuit filed by Paula Jones.
</P>
<P>
   In a scathing 34-page ruling, U.S. District Court Judge Susan
Webber Wright of Little Rock, Ark., said that Clinton had
deliberately refused to obey her orders to provide truthful
testimony during a Jan. 17, 1998, deposition before her and Mrs.
Jones' attorneys. She said the president's actions had subverted
the rule of law and violated Mrs. Jones' right to information
relevant to her case.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's order was the first time a president has been held in
contempt of court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court takes no pleasure whatsoever in holding this
nation's President in contempt of court,'' wrote the judge, a
onetime law student of Clinton's who was appointed to the bench by
President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   However, she said, ``The record demonstrates by clear and
convincing evidence that the President responded to plaintiffs'
questions by giving false, misleading and evasive answers that were
designed to obstruct the judicial process.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Wright cited the president for civil contempt and ordered
him to pay ``any reasonable expenses'' _ including legal fees _
incurred by Mrs. Jones as a result of Clinton's false testimony.
She gave Mrs. Jones' lawyers 20 days to submit an estimate of their
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   She also ordered Clinton to reimburse her court $1,202, the cost
of her travel to Washington in January 1998 to preside over the
deposition in the Jones suit, which was taken in the office of
Clinton's attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   And she referred the matter to the Professional Conduct
Committee of the Arkansas Supreme Court, which has the power to
revoke Clinton's license to practice law or impose other sanctions
on him. The panel hears all types of complaints against lawyers,
but is likely to take a referral from a federal judge particularly
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Wright said she attempted to treat Clinton as he would any
other defendant in a civil proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that regard,'' she wrote, ``there simply is no escaping the
fact that the President deliberately violated this court's
discovery orders and thereby undermined the integrity of the
judicial system. Sanctions must be imposed, not only to redress the
President's misconduct, but to deter others who might themselves
consider emulating the President of the United States by engaging
in misconduct that undermines the integrity of the judicial
system.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House referred all questions about the ruling to
Robert S. Bennett, one of Clinton's private attorneys. Bennett's
office said he would have no comment until he had a chance to
review the judge's order.
</P>
<P>
   But a member of the president's legal team, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said that it may not be in Clinton's legal,
political or financial interest to challenge the contempt citation.
To do so would involve several months of motions and hearings that
would keep the matter alive in the media and cost thousands of
dollars in additional legal fees. However, the president and his
advisers have not yet decided what to do, this lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   John W. Whitehead, one of several lawyers who represented Mrs.
Jones last year, said he could not give an accurate estimate of the
cost of Clinton's false testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to do an accounting,'' he said. ``We have to look at
everything that occurred after Jan. 17 and see if it can be
attributed to the president's answers that day.'' He said the
figure would likely be in the ``tens of thousands of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jones sued Clinton in 1994, alleging that he had made a
crude sexual advance to her in a Little Rock hotel room when he was
governor of Arkansas and she was a low-level state employee.
Clinton denied the allegations and sought to have the case quashed,
but the Supreme Court in 1997 unanimously ruled that the president
was subject to civil litigation even during his tenure in office.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Wright dismissed Mrs. Jones' lawsuit last April, saying
that the president's behavior, while boorish if proven, did not
meet the standard of sexual harassment under federal law. Mrs.
Jones appealed, and last November, Clinton settled her claim with
an out-of-court settlement and a payment of $850,000.
</P>
<P>
   As the Jones case was winding down, the criminal investigation
of the president was moving forward. On Aug. 17, Clinton appeared
by videotape before a federal grand jury and admitted that he had
had a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky over a 21-month period
from late 1995 through early 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The President directly contradicted his deposition testimony
by acknowledging `inappropriate intimate contact' with Ms. Lewinsky
on numerous occasions,'' Judge Wright said in Monday's order,
referring to his grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The judge said that she first learned that Clinton had given
false testimony in the Jones suit when Clinton went on television
that night to admit to having given ``misleading'' answers to Mrs.
Jones' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was during the President's televised address that the Court
first learned the President may be in contempt,'' Judge Wright
said.
</P>
<P>
   She revealed that she was considering citing Clinton for
contempt in a footnote to an order last September. She waited until
now to act, she said on Monday, because she did not want to
interfere with the ongoing criminal investigation and the
congressional impeachment inquiry and trial.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Wright ruled on Monday that Clinton testified falsely in
January of last year when he said that he did not recall being
alone with Ms. Lewinsky and denied having had a sexual relationship
with her. The judge said those statements were demonstrably false
and had denied Mrs. Jones the right to information that might have
supported her sexual harassment claim.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Representatives in December impeached Clinton on
two counts, perjury before the federal grand jury in August and
obstruction of justice. Members voted not to cite him for false
statements in the Jones lawsuit, in part because the case had been
dismissed by Judge Wright eight months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate acquitted Clinton on both charges in February.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's ruling, Judge Wright made several references to
other ``contumacious'' conduct by the president, which she said she
chose not to address in the interest of bringing the matter to a
reasonably swift conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   She specifically cited Clinton's violation of her order not to
discuss his deposition testimony with anyone outside his legal
team. She noted that a day after giving testimony, Clinton summoned
his private secretary, Betty Currie, to the White House to review
his testimony with her. Judge Wright noted that others had violated
her confidentiality order as well.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also said that she had not addressed other conduct by
the president because it was under investigation by Kenneth Starr,
the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Wright said she found the president in contempt without
holding extensive hearings because she limited her order to factual
matters that were not in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The President has essentially admitted that he intended to
mislead plaintiff in her efforts at gaining information deemed by
this Court to be relevant,'' the judge wrote, ``and hearings would
not assist the Court in addressing the President's misconduct
regarding his failure to obey this Court's discovery orders.''

 &HT;    Massive blaze engulfs historic neighborhood; 1 man trapped,
rescued
 &HT;    By Jay Croft, Gita Smith and Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The fire that consumed a Cabbagetown mill and the
resources of the entire Atlanta Fire Department began in a trash
can and was somehow caused by a construction torch, officials said
Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Within moments, it had become Atlanta's biggest blaze in 15
years, leading to the dramatic, televised rescue of a construction
worker as nearby homes and businesses were charred and more were
threatened.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze started about 2:35 p.m. at 170 Boulevard S.E., between
the fourth and fifth floors of the five-story Mill No. 1 at the
Fulton Bag and Cotton Mill, which was being renovated into a $45
million loft apartment complex.
</P>
<P>
   Winds gusted through large open windows, swirling the fire and
heat around the inside of the building, with each floor flaming
down to ignite the one below it.
</P>
<P>
   The fire department devoted virtually all its personnel and
equipment, with 110 firefighters, 35 engines and 10 ladder-trucks.
Atlanta Police and the Fulton County Sheriff's Department sent
dozens of officers, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind just made it horrendous,'' said Terry Wilson of
Forest Park, Ga., who was back visiting his old neighborhood in
southeast Atlanta when the fire started. ``This is sad to see. It's
like `Gone with the Wind.' Here goes Cabbagetown.''
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen houses and three or four apartment buildings were
substantially damaged by windswept flames, and other small fires
started on roofs.
</P>
<P>
   Several fire engines were assigned to look for flying debris on
the streets of Cabbagetown, an old part of town undergoing patch
urban renewal to emerge as something of a Bohemian quarter. Other
old mills have been renovated into businesses and residences; yards
are full of sculptures and tended gardens. The destroyed mill sat
in the center of a wheel, with streets extending like spokes.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors grabbed hoses to put out burning embers and rescue
dogs, since many people were not home during the middle of the
workday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty intense, a lot of people working together,''
said Lorrie Hulston, 31, as she sat against a wire fence. ``We
saved a lot of houses, I think, with garden hoses.''
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters arrived quickly, Hulston said. ``When they (the
homes) started collapsing, they asked us to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Embers burned through the roof and into a back closet of the
home of John Buck, 85. He was painting his home at the time because
he recently put it on the market and now said he has lost
everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a lot of things in my life, but I never expected
this,'' he said, unsure if he had insurance. ``I was going to sell
my house and move back to Minnesota where I was born. I figured I'd
end up there. Now, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood and much of metro Atlanta were riveted by the
cinematic rescue of construction worker Ivers Sims, who was
stranded on top of a 220-foot crane above the fire for more than an
hour. Firefighter Matt Moseley was lowered from a helicopter rope
and strapped Sims into a harness. Both were then carried to safety
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an intense fire, and we were really just praying for
the guys' safety,'' said Byron Harris, 37, who was working at A &AMP; R
Welding, across from the mill.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be up there and something like that, not knowing what the
outcome's going to be, seeing buildings crumble around you _ you
can't help but be scared. I know I would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something you had to see to know how dramatic it was,
and then to see the rescue.''
</P>
<P>
   Sims, 49, was taken to Atlanta Medical Center, where his first
request was for a Coca-Cola, said the doctor who treated him,
Howard Zaleznak.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing very well, as well as can be expected for someone
who was rescued from 220 feet in the air,'' Zaleznak said. ``Our
concern for him was gas from the fire and the heat, but we've found
no injuries. He's very quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   Sims of Woodland, Ala., a Birmingham suburb, was discharged from
the hospital's emergency room but was expected to spend the night
in visitors' section.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell said he will give a ``hero's
reception'' for Moseley, his squad and the helicopter pilot and his
assistant at noon Wednesday in the City Hall Atrium.
</P>
<P>
   The Campbell administration and fire department have been at
odds for years over issues like pay and staffing.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters union president David Rhodes said firefighters'
efforts were hindered Monday because each of 10 ladder-trucks was a
man short. Rhodes said he will plead with the city's Public Safety
Committee today to support the department.
</P>
<P>
   The department was also hindered by the dryness of the Atlanta
climate lately and powerful winds, Perhaps contributing to
tinderbox conditions, a cold front passed through the area,
dropping the relative humidity even lower, to 29 percent around the
time of the fire, said Jim Blair of the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been dry for almost two weeks,'' Blair said. ``It
doesn't take long for things to dry out in this Georgia sun.''

DUQUETTE WITH VAUGHN-LESS SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hey, he told you so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our communication with our fans during the offseason was that
we would have pitching depth, good defense, and still an exciting
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Duquette resisted the urge to say, ``Mo Who?'' as he made
that assessment Monday at Fenway Park on the eve of the Red Sox'
home opener. In fact, the general manager waged a heroic campaign
against indulging in any approximation of gloating.
</P>
<P>
   But even his best deadpan could not hide the immense pleasure he
is taking in the fact that his ball club _ the one he decided over
the winter could live without Mo Vaughn or a facsimile of a power
replacement _ is making him look good after months of maligning.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox' 5-1 start was a virtual blueprint of the GM's grand
design. Granted, it was against the Kansas City Royals and Tampa
Bay Devil Rays, the American League's soft underbelly. But it came
on the road, which can be treacherous terrain regardless of the
opponent, and it showcased superb starting pitching, an almost
flawless bullpen, trusty defense, and enough hitting to get by. Oh
yes, and a substantial portion of that hitting was provided by Jose
Offerman, the anti-Mo whom Duquette procured as his major winter
offensive acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   It all added up to five straight wins out of the gate, the first
such achievement by Boston since the 1946 pennant winner. And when
they finally faltered Sunday in Tampa, the Sox gave the Devil Rays
apoplexy by erasing a four-run deficit before falling, 5-4, as they
just missed duplicating the 1918 world champions' 6-0 start. ``So
we're in good company,'' said Duquette.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, on the eve of the home opener, Boston's record was
almost as spotless as Fenway. The nagging question: Like the
ballpark's appearance, is the team's performance an aberration?
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Duquette thinks not. And he offers 12 good
reasons to support his confidence _ starting pitchers Pedro
Martinez, Bret Saberhagen, Tim Wakefield, Mark Portugal, and Pat
Rapp, plus a bullpen anchored by Tom Gordon. Rapp was the only
starter who failed to win, and despite his troubles Sunday, the
game wasn't a lost cause because of the work of retread Rheal
Cormier and newcomers Kip Gross and Mark Guthrie. They kept the
Rays at bay until the Sox drew even, 4-4. And even though Derek
Lowe gave up the decisive homer to Danny Clyburn in the eighth, it
was only the second run surrendered by the bullpen, a large reason
the staff ERA is 1.40.
</P>
<P>
   ``With pitching like that,'' said Duquette, ``we're going to be
in a lot of games. And we're certainly going to be in a lot more
games than we were last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, of course, the Sox made the playoffs, which no one
expected of that crew and fewer do of this one. Still, while the
home team always is embraced by the local populace before its
Fenway debut, there should be a touch of euphoria in Tuesday's
forecast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning always helps,'' said Duquette of the fan perception.
``There's more interest and excitement in the team when you win
ballgames. That's true any time.''
</P>
<P>
   It may prove irrelevant this time, considering that a mere 156
games remain. Duquette is well aware that the season is barely a
heartbeat old, but he's also a student of history, and he knows
that a fast getaway beats the alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1984, Detroit got off to a good start (35-5) and ran away
with it,'' he said. ``In 1995, we had a good start (14-5) and made
the playoffs. In '96, we dug such a hole for ourselves (3-15) that
even though we had the best record in the second half, we came up a
couple of games shy.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 Sox are making Duquette's vision reality. For a week,
anyway. It remains to be seen whether it proves a mirage once the
weather and the competition heat up.

   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. _ Directors of the nation's nuclear bomb
laboratories should put a ``tourniquet'' on visits by foreign
scientists, the leader of a Senate delegation said Monday after two
days of security briefings at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Denouncing the ``hemorrhaging'' of bomb secrets to foreigners,
Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., stood in front of the 10-foot-high
metal fence at the laboratory's main gate and said, ``I would put a
tourniquet on it.''

   ``We are very concerned about the faxes, e-mails, people walking
through,'' said Shelby, chairman of the Select Committee on
Intelligence. ``It is a question of a very few people, who have _
in the past and I am sure will in the future _ tried to damage our
national security.''
</P>
<P>
   In the laboratory, the classified computers remained shut down
for the second week in a row as scientists attended security
seminars and laboratory directors worked on improving systems to
protect the nation's bomb secrets from outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We submitted plans on Friday to Secretary Richardson on what
we would do to improve security, to make it extremely difficult to
transfer information out of classified files,'' Sylvia Brucchi, the
laboratory spokeswoman, said Monday. She was referring to concerns
of Energy Secretary Bill Richardson that file diskettes containing
classified information could be inserted into nonclassified
computers to be sent by e-mail to outside computers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite senators' concerns about foreigners, it was accusations
about spying by an American citizen employed here that caused
concerns about laboratory security to mushroom last month. In early
March, the FBI identified that citizen, Wen Ho Lee, a Taiwan-born
computer scientist, as the prime suspect in the transfer of
advanced nuclear bomb plans to the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   On March 8, Lee was fired from his job at the laboratory for
security violations. But he has not been arrested or charged with
any crime.

ENERGY OFFICIAL SAYS ADMINISTRATION DISMISSED NUCLEAR SECRETS
THEFT
</HEADLINE>
   (ac) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A senior intelligence official at the Energy
Department said Monday that his superiors and other Clinton
administration officials repeatedly downplayed or dismissed
evidence that China had stolen nuclear weapons secrets from a
government weapons laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Notra Trulock, who was in charge of analyzing the
case for the Energy Department, told the Senate Armed Services
Committee that in some cases, senior officials made it clear to him
that information about the suspected espionage would harm the
credibility of the laboratories, hurt their efforts to work with
scientists in China and Russia, or might be used by Congress to
attack President Clinton's China policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must tell you,'' Trulock said in his first public statement
on the case, ``that our warnings were ignored, they were minimized
and occasionally even ridiculed, especially by laboratory
officials.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's session was the first public congressional hearing on
the mounting furor over the administration's handling of evidence
of China's theft of nuclear secrets. Several Democratic senators
objected, arguing that the matter was so sensitive that it should
be dealt with only in classified hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Trulock testified that in 1997, two senior Energy Department
officials tried to prevent him from briefing the new energy
secretary, Frederico Pena, about the investigation into China's
suspected theft of the design of America's most advanced nuclear
warhead, the W-88, from Los Alamos National Laboratory. Trulock
said that Victor Reis, the assistant energy secretary for defense
programs, and Kenneth Baker, the acting director of
non-proliferation at the department, prevented him from briefing
Pena for several months in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I was given on more than one occasion was that this
information could potentially hurt the credibility of the
laboratories,'' Trulock said. He added that Reis told him that the
information might also harm the laboratories' efforts to win
congressional financing for new initiatives for maintaining nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Trulock also said that in July 1998, Elizabeth A. Moler, then
acting energy secretary, blocked him from briefing Rep. Porter
Goss, R-Fla., chairman of the House Select Committee on
Intelligence, who had requested a briefing on the Los Alamos
espionage case. He said that Ms. Moler told him that the Congress
would only use the matter as ammunition with which to attack
Clinton's China policies.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moler, now a Washington lawyer in private practice,
testified Monday that she could not recall ever being told about
Goss' request for the July 1998 briefing on the espionage case. But
she adamantly denied that she actually told Trulock not to brief
Goss.
</P>
<P>
   She could not explain, however, how a memo from Trulock
concerning the briefing request, which was made public Monday, was
later found in her safe in her office.
</P>
<P>
   The July 21, 1998, memo, from Trulock to Ms. Moler and Ernest
Moniz, the energy undersecretary, states that Trulock had received
a request from the House intelligence committee staff the day
before requesting the briefing for Goss, along with Rep. Norman
Dicks, D-Wash., the ranking minority member, and members of their
staffs.
</P>
<P>
   The memorandum was retrieved from her safe when she left the
department and returned to the Energy Department's intelligence
office without any notations on whether she concurred with his
request to brief the committee or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deal with large volumes of information,'' Ms. Moler said.
``But I don't have any rational explanation for this incident.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moler stressed, however, that she had taken the issue of
possible Chinese espionage seriously, and that she and Pena worked
hard to improve counter-intelligence and security programs at the
labs.
</P>
<P>
   With lawmakers focusing on the conflicting testimony of Trulock
and Ms. Moler, she attacked Trulock's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have respect for Mr. Trulock as an analyst,'' Ms. Moler
said. ``I don't believe he is always careful with the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Trulock also told the committee that Gary Samore, the National
Security Council's senior director for non-proliferation, told him
in 1997 that the Los Alamos spy case would not interfere with the
Clinton administration's policy of using the laboratories as ``a
tool to further its engagement policy with China.''
</P>
<P>
   Samore's comments came when Trulock was briefing him on the spy
case, in August 1997, at a time when Samore was also helping the
White House prepare for an October 1997 summit with China.
</P>
<P>
   Samore said in an earlier interview that if he did make such a
comment in the midst of a briefing on the spy case, he was joking.
</P>
<P>
   Trulock did add, however, that Samore did ``encourage us to go
forward with our counter-intelligence efforts in order to protect
sensitive information at the laboratories.''

PHIL LESH'S NEW ZONE: GRATEFUL DEAD BASSIST CELEBRATES
LIVER  TRANSPLANT WITH RETURN TO STAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES SULLIVAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO &LR;   &LR; _ When Phil Lesh went in for a liver transplant
in December, old friend and transplant survivor David Crosby kidded
him about his hospital gown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted a picture of me with my a_ hanging out,'' Lesh says
with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, it was no laughing matter. Last September the
Grateful Dead bassist, 59, was rushed to the hospital with an acute
case of internal bleeding. After he had lived for years with the
symptoms of liver disease, diagnosed in 1991 as hepatitis C, the
infection finally caught up with him.
</P>
<P>
   This week Lesh celebrates his successful surgery, returning to
the concert stage with three Phil Lesh &AMP; Friends shows at the
Warfield in San Francisco. Proceeds from Thursday's opening night
will benefit Lesh's Unbroken Chain foundation, which he plans to
use to increase awareness about liver disease.
</P>
<P>
   He feels good. ``The doctors are extremely pleased,'' Lesh says
in his first interview since the operation. ``The first weeks after
the transplant they were using words like `beautiful' and
`perfect.' There've been a couple of little bumps, but they've been
minor ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Helping himself to a piece of lemon cake, he's sitting alongside
his wife, Jill, at the dining room table of their new home in Marin
County, north of San Francisco. Through tall plate-glass windows
they share a view of the morning dew on the property's lush
greenery.
</P>
<P>
   Having experienced a hepatitis ``flareup'' as far back as the
early 1970s, Lesh cleaned up more than a decade ago, around the
birth of his first of two sons, Grahame and Brian. He quit
drinking, started exercising and became a vegetarian.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the disease began to affect his energy and appearance.
Lesh struggled last summer through the first tour of the Other
Ones, the eight-piece post-Dead group he established with band
mates Bob Weir and Mickey Hart. He was 30 pounds underweight. But
the performances drew raves from fans and critics around the
country and kept him going.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be in bad shape, and if the music is happening you
don't even notice,'' Lesh says. ``When I was playing with those
guys, I was in heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   But when he got home, he knew it was time to deal with his
illness. ``People were saying, `Wow, you don't look good, man,'''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see he was gray,'' says his wife, who lost her
father to liver cancer several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As word spread of Lesh's illness, the Deadhead community rallied
via the Internet. ``One Sunday just before we went out of town (to
the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Fla.), they all agreed to send me
good vibes at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sat out here'' _ he waves a hand at the porch _ ``and you
could feel it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Such serenity, he says, isn't always the norm within the Dead
camp. ``After Jerry (Garcia) died there was a lot of stress in the
organization. We had to consolidate our operations, and there was
resistance to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lesh's wife now goes to the Dead's board meetings. ``While Jerry
was alive, let me say, it wasn't as difficult as it is now,'' he
says. ``Now I feel I'm in the minority most of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   After Garcia's death in 1995, Lesh fought against bringing
investors into the Dead fold, which was reeling from the loss of
its touring income. ``Phil was kind of the lone cowboy,'' says his
wife. ``It seemed like a quick fix at the time, but then you'd be
hearing `Truckin' ' for Chevy trucks and stuff like that.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Other Ones formed a year ago, there was much
speculation over who would take Garcia's place. The band
compromised, hitting the road with two guitarists, Steve Kimock and
Mark Karan. (Kimock and Other Ones drummer John Molo will play in
Lesh's band this week, along with guitarist Trey Anastasio and
keyboardist Page McConnell of the band Phish.)
</P>
<P>
   Lesh fought to keep the Other Ones lineup compact. ``I know that
it could be even more successful musically if there wasn't quite so
much clutter _ not so much solo after solo after solo, but more of
a conversation. Which was what the Grateful Dead were all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally intended as a one-time reunion, the Other Ones were
preparing to tour again this summer. Lesh declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not so much a question of my health as the issues that
are still unresolved,'' he says. Among other things, the band needs
new material, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise it's just going to be the best Grateful Dead cover
band in the world,'' he chuckles, folding his hands.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he is returning to his early training as a
classical composer, working on a ``symphonic tapestry'' of Dead
riffs and themes tentatively titled ``Keys to the Rain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have sketches for all seven movements and a little bit of
the introduction composed, and I'm hoping to get down to it
seriously this year,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The Phil Lesh &AMP; Friends shows are an opportunity for him to
collaborate with musicians outside the Dead's immediate circle.
``What I'm interested in doing now is pursuing my own path. That
certainly doesn't preclude playing with those guys,'' including
``Open Nature,'' an April 27 benefit in Santa Rosa, Calif., billed
to Lesh, Weir and Hart individually.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just that the Grateful Dead was my band for 30 years. I
never went out and played with other musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The neat thing is there are as many people interested in
playing with me as I am interested in playing with them.''

RAMBIS THRIVES ON COMPETING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Kurt Rambis was wearing those familiar
thick, black-framed specs and had to sit down to catch his breath
after a physically demanding workout. He looked like a guy ready
for the big game.
</P>
<P>
   Ready to PLAY in the big game. He sounded like it too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love playing against (top) competition. I would rather play
82 games against the best teams in the league than have to do
anything else. . . . I like competition, I like good players, I
like great teams. To me, that's what makes basketball fun,'' the
Lakers' coach said Monday, on the eve of his team's first showdown
with the Portland Trail Blazers, owners of the NBA's best record.
</P>
<P>
   In this most unusual of seasons, the schedule has kept apart the
Pacific Division's top two teams until today, game 40 of the
Lakers' 50-game slate. They'll make up for it by playing four times
in the next three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps still pumped from practicing with his players, Rambis
almost had to be reminded he wasn't playing in this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was a player, I'd love to be in this game,'' he said.
``I'm a coach and I'd love to watch a game like this, I'd love to
coach a game like this.''
</P>
<P>
   At 25-14, the Lakers are 4{ games behind the Trail Blazers
(28-8), and there's time to wrest away the division title that L.A.
was favored to win.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say, the Lakers have eagerly anticipated this
meeting, though they will be shorthanded tonight _ Glen Rice is ill
and did not make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody's a little curious to see what kind of game
it's gonna be,'' Kobe Bryant said. ``We know they're gonna come out
with everything they've got, play with a lot of emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   The sixth seed in the playoffs a year ago, the always-talented
but formerly underachieving Blazers have blossomed into one of the
top teams in the league and hold the No. 1 seeding in the Western
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   It's partially a product of growth, partially an infusion of
talent that has made Portland deep enough to play two unique
starting units. Five players average double figures in scoring, and
seven average at least 8.5 points and 20 minutes per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep team. Deep team,'' Bryant said. ``They can come at you in
waves. It doesn't stop. Nonstop energy.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Hold the Rice: Without Rice (sore throat, fever), the Lakers
aren't sure what lineup they'll throw at Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Ruben Patterson got the start Sunday but played only 11
minutes. Rambis might opt for Rick Fox or Robert Horry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still weighing our options,'' he said. ``We not only
have to worry about starters, we have to worry about (how it
affects) our bench punch as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Travis Knight, on the injured list with Achilles tendinitis,
also caught a fever and sore throat and did not practice Monday.

 &HT;    Hero firefighter, 30, 'felt completely at home' dangling in air
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Sharon Hembree found at work about the raging
inferno at the Fulton Bag and Cotton Mill lofts Monday afternoon,
she knew her only child , an Atlanta firefighter, was right in the
thick of it. But little did she know then, that her son Matt
Moseley, was the hero who dangled under a helicopter hundreds of
feet in the air to save another man's life.
</P>
<P>
   Hembree found when she walked into the apartment she shares with
her mother Lottie Hembree.
</P>
<P>
   The older woman, frightened but calm, pointed to the TV:
''That's your son up there,' `` Lottie Hembree told her daughter.
``I was overwhelmed. My mom just knew it was him even though she
couldn't see from what they showed on TV. She just had a feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Hembree ran to another room and flipped on the set. She also had
a feeling that the man in the yellow firefighter's suit, sailing
over hundreds of cheering people who lined up along DeKalb Avenue
and other streets, was her 30-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   There was no question among Moseley's workmates from Squad Four
on Ellis Street downtown who would take the ride to save Ivers'
life, said Atlanta Capt. Tom Doyle.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just told Matt you're getting in the harness and you're
going up,'' Doyle said. ``He never questioned me, he was ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Moseley came to Atlanta in 1996 from the Fayette County (Ga.)
Fire Department, where he was firefighter of the year in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Moseley was anxious to get in the air. ''I felt completely at
home when I was in the air, because I knew I was on my way to
saving this man,'' Moseley said. ''I wasn't doing anything on the
ground. I had trained long and hard for this moment. I knew I was
going to get him.''
</P>
<P>
   Moseley's confidence comes from the hours of training he and the
other firefighters in Squad Four on Ellis Street downtown must go
through. The courses, called High Altitude Rope Rescue, are
required of all firefighters who work the Squad Four station
because of the skyscrapers downtown.
</P>
<P>
   When he finally reached Sims as he lay silent and motionless
across the steel crane, Moseley said he carefully swung towards the
man and cracked a joke: ``Your boss told to come up here so you
could knock off work early,'' Moseley said. ``He didn't say a word
to me. I told him not to touch me. I told him I would get him out
of there. I knew I would.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Hembree said Moseley called her as soon as he could,
shortly after taking a call from Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I answered the phone he said, 'Hi mom. What are you
doing? Turn on the TV,'' 'Hembree said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told him, 'I'm already watching TV. What are you doing.
</P>
<P>
   '' By then, I knew he was all right. We were so proud of him.''

 &HT;    Construction worker stable in hospital
 &HT;    ATTENTION: Alabama editors.
 &HT;    By David Pendered and Rhonda Cook
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The world was burning beneath Ivers Sims Monday so he
found safety perched precariously 220 feet above the ground.
</P>
<P>
   About an hour later, an angel dressed as a firefighter swooped
down to rescue the 49-year-old Alabama man.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's resting, but he still has a lot of monitors hooked up to
him,'' the Rev. Benford Stellmacher said after praying with Sims in
his hospital room. ``God was with him, and angels of God were with
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sims was resting in stable condition after being treated for
smoke inhalation and exposure to heat at Atlanta Medical Center
Monday evening. With him was his wife, Marilyn; his two sons and
daughter; a brother and his sister-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   ```Reverend, the Lord sure was with me,' '' Stellmacher said
Sims told him.
</P>
<P>
   Stellmacher, an associate minister of Antioch East Baptist
Church in Atlanta, said he reminded Sims to ``keep cool and calm
down. You didn't panic and that firefighter risked his life to come
save you.''
</P>
<P>
   Stellmacher, who hadn't met Sims before Monday, said if Sims is
not a Christian, ``he's a believer now.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49-year-old Woodland, Ala., man had been working
construction 20 years when he found himself holding on for dear
life above a Gay Construction Co. worksite Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   He had been working atop the crane _ as he had many times before
_ when a fire started in the 124-year-old mill that was being
converted into loft apartments in an area of east Atlanta known as
Cabbagetown.
</P>
<P>
   Sims crawled to the top of a concrete counterweight at the end
of the crane's horizontal arm, waiting on his stomach about 20 feet
from the black smoke and flames that appeared to climb up the
center of the structure. He seemed calm even as the crane swayed in
wind gusts over 30 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Until firefighter Matt Moseley swooped down from a rope and
quipped that Sims' boss had sent him up to fetch him so he could
knock off work early.
</P>
<P>
   After dangling hundreds of feet above the ground, Sims, a
humble, quiet man, was greeted with applause and cameras when he
was dropped on a grassy spot far from the burning mill.
</P>
<P>
   He was not seen again after he was put into an ambulance and
taken to Atlanta Medical Center (formerly Georgia Baptist
Hospital), where he was reported to be in good shape.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials described Sims as being in ``good spirits''
despite his experience and a little reluctant to talk to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Medical Center emergency room physician Dr. Howard
Zaleznak said Sims was ``very quiet'' after his ordeal. ``I can
imagine he's thinking about his experience and how lucky he is.''
</P>
<P>
   While Sims was discharged by doctors from Atlanta Medical
Center, he was expected to stay the night in a guest room there,
hospital officials said. His family was to stay with a relative
living in Atlanta.

punishing newspaper stocks, and should dead-tree publishers respond
by spinning off pieces of their Web sites to the public?
</P>
<P>
   Just a couple of questions for newspaper executives to ponder as
the American Society of Newspaper Editors' annual convention gets
under way this week at San Francisco's Fairmont Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   It's with a twist of irony that the Old World newspaper
establishment is holding its yearly confab in a city delirious with
Internet fever. And if the editors take a quick glance at local
real estate classifieds in between noshes of jumbo shrimp, they'll
get a taste of the dramatic impact that dot-com mania is having on
the economies of San Francisco and Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Residential real estate values in the Bay Area have rocketed to
insane levels as digital barons plunk down cash for million-dollar
homes in what is now, arguably, the most expensive place to live in
the country. (Apologies to New Yorkers who beg to differ.)
</P>
<P>
   Flush with pre-offering stock options, warrants and shares, the
media executives of tomorrow find themselves richer on paper than
most of today's top newspaper publishing brass.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they aren't alone. Programmers, designers and other
techies are also grabbing their pieces of the pie. As are the
bankers, analysts and lawyers who encourage Internet companies to
go public _ often before earning their first dime _ and tend to
advise them to merge before holding their first shareholders
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what do frothy share valuations for Internet stocks have to
do with newspaper companies?
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, investors' infatuation with Net stocks is hurting
the share prices of traditional newspaper publishers, such as the
New York Times, the (Chicago) Tribune and Knight Ridder (publisher
of the San Jose Mercury News and the Contra Costa Times), says
financial analyst John Morton of Silver Spring, Md. (Chronicle
Publishing, by the way, is privately held.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite a relatively strong economy and flat newsprint costs,
the average stock price of the top publicly held newspaper
companies slipped 5.4 percent during the first two months of this
year, according to Morton, who tracks 16 companies in that group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall Street is in the throes of ecstasy with Internet
companies, which are perceived as threats to newspapers,'' says
Morton, who was a journalist before making the transition to
financial analyst.
</P>
<P>
   (First-quarter financial results for newspaper companies have
been mixed. But yesterday, Dow Jones, Gannett and E.W. Scripps
reported robust profits that, on average, jumped 14.6 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   Concerns over whether the U.S economy could continue to hum in
1999 prompted many investors to hold back on buying newspaper
stocks during the first quarter of this year, Morton says.
</P>
<P>
   But the perception that Web-based media could eventually begin
to erode the advertising bases of newspaper publishers has been the
primary anchor weighing down their share prices, he says.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest threats to traditional newspaper revenues is
the meteoric success of Internet companies that compete for
classified advertising business, such as online auctioneer eBay and
job placement concerns, such as TMP Worldwide, owner of Monster.com
_ an Internet job-finding site.
</P>
<P>
   Classified advertising, which is mostly local, accounts for
roughly 50 percent of an average newspapers' revenues, Morton says.
So far, the online auction operations haven't established regional
sites, which would allow people to sell goods to each other in the
same city.
</P>
<P>
   But Internet analysts say that day is not far off. And once
regional sites are launched, newspapers will face serious threats
to their bread-and-butter classified ads.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, many major newspaper companies, such as Tribune and
Gannett, are diversified beyond just newspapers. They also own
broadcasting and other media operations. However, each of the
publishing companies tracked by Morton relies on newspaper proceeds
for the majority of its revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the newspaper companies Morton follows have established
formidable Internet properties built on the credibility and
news-gathering capabilities of their flagship papers.
</P>
<P>
   So, why don't newspaper companies unlock the value of their
Internet properties by spinning off minority stakes of their Web
operations to the public? Why fight the tape?
</P>
<P>
   Major broadcasting, cable and entertainment conglomerates, such
as Time Warner and CBS, are mulling strategies to sell stakes in
their Web sites. (Of course, Time Warner is also a magazine
publisher.) And now, another media giant, Walt Disney is reportedly
considering different strategies that would allow its Internet
investments to fetch sky-high Net valuations.
</P>
<P>
   Disney, whose stock has been lagging during the past 12 months,
controls various Web sites through its many divisions, including
ESPN and ABC. It also has a 43 percent stake in Infoseek, a public
company that operates a search engine.
</P>
<P>
   And according to at least one financial analyst, Laura Martin of
CS First Boston, entertainment giants like Disney have little
choice but to take their Web sites public. Martin says, despite the
legal and brand-control complications of breaking off pieces of
Disney, it is imperative because Disney sorely needs an
Internet-like stock valuation to compete with Web superstars such
as America Online, Yahoo and Amazon.com
</P>
<P>
   In order to attract top talent and remain competitive with new
media upstarts, entertainment conglomerates must pay employees in
stock options of Internet concerns. What's more, the parent
companies need the currency of inflated Internet shares in order to
afford acquisitions, Martin says. ``It's simply too expensive to
buy an Internet company using Disney stock or Time Warner stock,''
Martin says.
</P>
<P>
   The same may hold true for newspaper companies, if they hope to
grow and compete with new media juggernauts during the next
century. Instead of waiting for the Internet to fully develop,
newspaper publishers may need to act now and sell minority stakes
of their online divisions in order to keep up with the new kids on
the information block. ``But there is some danger in that,'' Morton
warns. If newspaper companies try to spin off their Web sites to
fetch higher stock valuations, they will probably hurt the shares
of the parent company, he says.
</P>
<P>
   He contends that newspaper bulls who believe in the future of
dead-tree publishing stocks are banking on the potential profits
generated by their fledgling online operations. If newspaper
stalwarts spin those operations off, Morton feels that shares of
the parent companies would go down because the Internet is
considered a key to their futures.
</P>
<P>
   More important, if and when the Internet bubble bursts, the
newspapers' Internet operations might eventually be valued less
than they are today as part of their larger, old-guard parent,
Morton says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because, who knows how long the (Internet frenzy) will last?''
Morton says.

CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS MEET WITH CLINTON ON KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Ill., Okla., S.C., Va.)  (lb) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On their first day back after a two-week recess,
congressional leaders told President Clinton on Monday night that
they are prepared to support his actions in Yugoslavia but that he
must make a better case, to them and to the public, particularly if
the United States decides it is necessary to send ground forces to
the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   At their meeting Monday evening at the White House, the
president reviewed the NATO air campaign and discussed an emergency
appropriation to finance the Kosovo mission. Monday night's
hourlong meeting served as a high-level briefing and gave the
president an idea of what to expect on Tuesday morning when he
meets with a bigger group of several dozen lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Several top administration officials have spent the past few
days anticipating growing support for ground troops among some
returning members of Congress, and debates on varying resolutions
regarding Kosovo are to take place in Congress later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional representatives and some senators have been
critical of the administration's lack of a plan for ending the
action in Yugoslavia, and of what they say is its refusal to
seriously evaluate the use of ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   During the congressional recess, a subtle policy shift has
occurred as the air campaign continued with lackluster results, in
part because of bad weather and the refugee crisis. Pentagon
officials have stopped ruling out completely the use of ground
forces, although they insist no plans are currently on the table.
</P>
<P>
   As late as Monday, Defense Secretary William Cohen said there
was no consensus among NATO allies for the use of ground troops. He
acknowledged that military planners had considered the option
months ago, and said plans could be quickly updated should the need
arise.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, Sen. Trent Lott, the Republican leader from
Mississippi, told reporters that he expected the president to have
more specific information Tuesday, such as how much the mission
will cost and how the military commanders are judging the success
rate of the bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Lott also said that after a two-week recess in which he talked
with voters in four states, he believes most Americans still do not
understand the mission against the Yugoslav president, Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would describe it in one word _ quizzical,'' he said of the
general reaction. ``Like, why? And what? They're not certain
exactly what our national security interests are.''
</P>
<P>
   The leaders met the president Monday night after he returned
from a quick day-trip to Louisiana, where he spoke to bomber crews
at Barksdale Air Force Base. He said the allied forces would
continue the air assault on Serbian troops until Milosevic
withdraws from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   He made no new policy, but used the trip as he did a similar
visit to the Norfolk Naval Station 10 days ago to thank the troops
involved in the Balkan conflict and to project an image of an
active commander-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is America at its best,'' he told the troops. ``We seek
no territorial gain; we seek no political advantage. This is
America trying to get the world to live on human terms, so we can
have peace and freedom in Europe and our people will not be called
to fight a wider war for someone else's madness.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's 20-minute address was somber and the tarmac crowd was
subdued. But the president did win an ovation when he announced
that all servicemen and women in the Balkan conflict would be
exempt from income taxes while they are deployed. All will also
receive an automatic extension of the April 15 tax-filing deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The tax break, which is customary for extended service in combat
zones, applies to what the Pentagon calls the Kosovo area of
operations: Yugoslavia, Albania, the Adriatic Sea and the northern
Ionian Sea. The tax break will also apply to personnel serving in
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia and Croatia under earlier
deployments.
</P>
<P>
   All American members of the military serving in the region also
will receive $150 a month in hazardous-duty pay.
</P>
<P>
   As members of Congress returned from their spring break, it was
clear that Kosovo would quickly rise to the top of their agenda.
Some are urging the use of ground forces, some are urging caution,
and some are reflecting a growing anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message that we send in the next 48, 72 hours out of this
Congress,'' said Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., ``could have a
huge effect on the outcome of this conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Many members of Congress are questioning how the military effort
should be paid for, others whether it should continue at all,
especially in the absence of a formal declaration of war. Senate
Democrats are promoting a resolution to express Senate support for
the use of ground troops if that becomes necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Dennis Hastert said that Congress intends to spend the
next few days gathering information from the Clinton administration
and the next few weeks holding hearings. He also said a senior
delegation from the House would fly to the Balkans at the end of
this week to investigate.

</P>
<P>
   ``The American people have several questions about our efforts
in Kosovo,'' the speaker, R-Ill., said. ``Does continued American
involvement in the region further our national interests? Do we
have a long-term strategy? What are the costs of this action? What
are the costs of inaction? Do we have an exit strategy?''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., the majority whip, criticized the
president for making a ``mess'' of things by using only airstrikes
and ruling out the use of ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, he said, ``probably made a mistake and said, `We're
going to do half a war, we're just going to bomb, we're not going
to do ground troops.' I don't know that you can do it halfway. He's
got us into this mess, and I'm very troubled by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Floyd Spence, chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, said he found ``the absence of clearly defined
objectives'' for NATO's war plans ``deeply troubling.''
</P>
<P>
   ```Not losing' does not constitute a viable strategy,'' Spence,
R-S.C., said in a written statement. He said he was worried about
the ``uncertainty over the extent of the U.S. military commitment
in the months and years ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of a congressional delegation, Dodd spent most of the
two-week recess at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, and in
the Balkans, and visited a refugee camp in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Of Milosevic, Dodd said, ``I think it's extremely important, to
the extent possible, that he understand that there is a common
purpose and common resolve in this country, among Democrats and
Republicans, to prevail in this contest of wills.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other Democrats, Dodd supports using ground troops if the
military leaders deem it necessary. ``Everything should be left on
the table, including the option of using ground forces in Kosovo,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Sen. John Warner, chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, urged a cautious approach. ``I want my
colleagues in the Senate, if they vote, to understand the
ramifications'' of authorizing Clinton to send ground troops to
fight in the Balkans, said Warner, R-Va., in an interview. He said
there was no way to assess the support in the Senate for deploying
soldiers until members grasped those risks and costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress needs, right now, to get a complete understanding of
all the options'' for ground forces, he said, adding that that
``the sizes, composition, risks and likelihood of success'' of some
of those options would be sobering to senators, given ``the
terrain, the weather, the tremendous hostility.''

 &HT;    Governmental staff briefings should be public, House says
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ City councils, school boards and other
government bodies would no longer be allowed to conduct secret
staff briefings under a bill the Texas House approved Monday.
</P>
<P>
   House members passed the bill on second reading, and may amend
it when they weigh final passage today.
</P>
<P>
   Bill sponsor Rep. Steven Wolens, D-Dallas, said the Austin
school board's actions during the ongoing controversy over doctored
Texas Assessment of Academic Skills test results fueled his
determination to eliminate the staff briefings loophole. ``There
was some cheating on the TAAS scores, and they went into executive
session to discuss that _ and that kind of got my goat,'' Wolens
said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the state's open meetings law, a government body must
announce its meetings in advance and open them to the public. But
the law doesn't apply to staff briefings, even when a quorum _ the
minimum number of members required to conduct official business _
is present.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, board members gather information, rather than
debate, when government employees brief them on an issue. But
supporters of House Bill 156 say questions posed by board members
and the answers given by staff constitute deliberations that should
be conducted publicly. Opponents say the exemption allows officials
to discuss sensitive issues more candidly.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which still must be approved by the Senate, would
eliminate the exemption for staff briefings where a quorum is
present. It would preserve existing exemptions for discussions
about litigation, personnel matters, real estate and other
sensitive subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information that these elected officials are receiving is
information paid for by the taxpayers,'' said Suzy Woodford of
Common Cause Texas, a government watchdog group. ``We think the
public should be able to get the same information so that the
public will know whether or not the decisions these government
officials are making are being made in the public interest or in a
vested interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar bills have failed in recent sessions, but several groups
and government entities that were against eliminating the exemption
in previous years dropped their opposition this time around.
Woodford said a drumbeat of media criticism may have spurred the
turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   William Cunningham, chancellor of the University of Texas Board
of Regents, said his board simply found that it could live without
the staff briefings exemption.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an easy vehicle for discussing some controversial
issues for the Board of Regents,'' Cunningham said. ``But we have
learned we can have candid discussions in the open and that the
public is well-served by open and frank discussions of
controversial matters.''

DOUBTS RISE ON TAKEOVER OF MILITARY SHIPBUILDER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., La.)  (lb) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the Pentagon saying it is only days away from deciding
whether to permit a hostile $1.4 billion takeover of Newport News
Shipbuilding Inc. by General Dynamics Corp., speculation over the
fate of the deal increased Monday after the chairman of the Senate
Armed Services Committee said it was ``less likely'' that the
government would approve the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., who has criticized the deal, which
would put 80 percent of the Navy's shipbuilding capacity in the
merged company, said over the weekend that the ``case against it is
growing stronger every day.'' Warner declined to comment further
Monday, although the stock of Newport News fell $3.0625 a share, or
almost 10 percent, to $27.6875, a sign that Wall Street had lowered
its expectation that the takeover would be approved.
</P>
<P>
   Warner's weekend statement was taken seriously in a community
that was already skeptical of a proposal that would leave the
United States with only one supplier of nuclear-powered submarines
and put four of the six military shipyards in the ownership of one
company.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Warner chairman of the committee that reviews all
Pentagon spending, but he is also considered to be close to the
Defense Secretary William Cohen, formerly a Republican senator from
Maine, from the days when they served on the Senate committee
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal may still have some life in it,'' said Charles
Gabriel Jr., a Washington analyst for Prudential Securities. ``But
certainly there's a lot less room for optimism, because Warner is
the committee's chairman, and the fact that this emanated from his
office shows he is still resistant to the marriage. Moreover, his
pipeline to Cohen should be good. When Cohen was a senator, he and
Warner dominated the location of shipbuilding resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Flood, a Pentagon spokesman, said Monday, ``We're getting
close, we're talking days away'' to a Pentagon announcement on the
merger. ``We haven't made a final decision; the review and analysis
continues,'' Flood added. A spokeswoman for Newport News said the
company had not received any indication from the Pentagon of the
deal's fate, and a spokeswoman for General Dynamics said the same
thing.
</P>
<P>
   When it was announced in February, the General Dynamics bid
stunned the military industry because of an evolving Pentagon
policy discouraging such massive consolidations and because it
complicated an existing friendly merger that had been announced
between Newport News and Avondale Industries of New Orleans, a
maker of amphibious transport, assault ships and cargo vessels for
the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of General Dynamics' hostile bid, the Pentagon
approved Newport News' $519 million takeover of Avondale.
</P>
<P>
   But the Newport News-Avondale deal, which would have created a
merged company that could compete better with General Dynamics than
either shipbuilder alone, has been put on hold while the Pentagon
reviews the General Dynamics offer. If the General Dynamics deal is
approved, Avondale would be left operating on its own. Avondale's
stock rose $2.125 a share Monday, to $31.375.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Kitchen, Avondale's chief financial officer, said Monday
that his company had not heard anything yet from the Pentagon, but
if the Newport News-Avondale deal cleared Washington hurdles, it
could close sometime this quarter.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Virginia, the home state of Newport News, members of the
congressional delegation have lined up against the General Dynamics
takeover. Warner and Sen. Charles Robb, a Democrat, wrote a joint
letter to Cohen saying that ``the proposed merger is a matter of
great concern to us,'' citing national security issues.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Herbert Bateman, R-Va., sent a similar letter to Cohen
expressing ``staunch opposition'' to General Dynamics' bid, and
similar letters were written by three other Virginia
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   There has been much speculation about why General Dynamics would
make such a long-shot hostile offer in an industry in which most
mergers are transacted on a friendly basis. But one military
industry consultant said that General Dynamics had little choice in
the timing, because it had to make its move before the Newport
News-Avondale deal was completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think General Dynamics ever thought this was an easy
thing to do,'' the consultant said. ``They just were not able to
pick their timing.''

 How to Keep Track Of Splits
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Arthur M. Louis &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I want to take advantage of the stock-split calendar
provided on the Yahoo Web site. Would you please explain the
footnote indicating ``optional'' next to a company's name? Does
that mean the stock probably will split but not definitely?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  This might be a good time to pay your annual visit to
the optometrist. Take a closer look at the footnote and you will
find that the word is ``optionable.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if you had read it correctly, I can see where you might
be puzzled. ``Optionable'' is Wall Street jargon meaning that it is
possible to buy options on the stock in question. If you are
speculating that a split will cause a sharp increase in the stock
price, Yahoo is hinting that you might want to buy call options,
rather than the stock itself, to get extra leverage.
</P>
<P>
   This new fad of buying stock in companies simply because they
plan to (or might conceivably) split their shares has me perplexed.
The purpose of a split is to keep the share price at a reasonably
low level, so it will be affordable by virtually all investors. It
produces no change whatever in the underlying asset. Earnings
aren't going to rise because a company suddenly has twice as many
shares outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, as advocates of this investment technique
observe, a stock split may signify that a company's management is
rousingly optimistic about future prospects. If management thought
the stock was too high and likely to decline, it wouldn't bother
splitting the stock.
</P>
<P>
   There is logic in that view _ provided the optimism isn't
overdone or faked. And it certainly is true that stocks often make
big, short-term leaps when stock splits are announced, or when the
split takes effect. If you can make money at it, more power to you.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone else interested in taking the plunge, the Yahoo split

   BofA Stock
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the recent merger of Bank of America with NationsBank, I
exchanged my old BofA stock for new BofA stock. As part of the
transaction, I received $35 in cash in lieu of a fractional share.
How do I handle this on my tax return? Is this considered a cash
dividend, or is there a capital gain? If a capital gain, how do I
compute the amount? I had been buying BofA shares from time to time
during the past 20 years, so which share would represent the cost
basis in figuring my gain?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: According to the bank, the Internal Revenue Service said
the transaction must be treated as a capital gain. You received
$35, so part of that is a capital gain, while the rest represents
your purchase price and is not taxable.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how to figure your gain, as explained by a BofA
spokesman:
</P>
<P>
   The value of one share at the time of the merger was calculated
by the company at $56.3625. Divide $35 by $56.3625 and you get
0.62. So your cash payment represented 0.62 share.
</P>
<P>
   Your next step is to determine how much you paid for that 0.62
share. The IRS normally requires you to report share sales on a
first-in, first-out basis. So look up the price you paid for the
first share you bought.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know what that price is. But let's say you paid $3 per
share _ adjusted for subsequent splits. Then your cost basis would
be $3 times 0.62, or $1.86. Subtract that from the $35 you received
for the fractional share and you get $33.14 _ the amount to report
as a capital gain.
</P>
<P>
   Check your purchase price, substitute it in the example above,
and you will have the amount of your actual capital gain, which you
should report on Schedule D of federal Form 1040.
</P>
<P>
   Zero-Coupon Investing
</P>
<P>
   Q: How does one calculate the current yield and the yield to
maturity of a zero-coupon bond? I am considering an investment in
the American Century Target Maturities Trust, Series 2025, which
invests in zero-coupon U.S. Treasury securities maturing in 2025.
The price recently was quoted at $28.53 per $100 face value.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Since your question gives the American Century trust some
free publicity, I asked David Schroeder, the trust manager, to do
the hard work for you.
</P>
<P>
   He points out that there is no such thing as a current yield on
a zero-coupon bond, because you receive no interest payments
between the time you buy it and the time it matures. Your profit
from a zero is the difference between the price you receive when
the bond matures and the amount you paid originally.
</P>
<P>
   You can find yields to maturity of individual zero-coupon bonds
listed in some publications, such as Barron's. Or, in the case of a
trust, you can always call the manager.
</P>
<P>
   But if you are intent on doing it yourself, try this formula,
which you should be able to solve quickly enough with a scientific
calculator:
</P>
<P>
   First, divide the current price of the bond into its value at
maturity. In the example you give, you would divide 100 by 28.53,
which equals 3.505.
</P>
<P>
   Second, determine the number of years to maturity, double that
figure _ to simulate the twice-a-year interest payments you get
with ordinary Treasury bonds _ and divide it into 1. Since there
are 26 years remaining until 2025, the result, in your example,
would be 1/52, or 0.0192.
</P>
<P>
   Take the figure in step one _ 3.505, in your case _ and raise it
to a power of 0.0192, the figure you got in step two. (This is
where the scientific calculator becomes essential.) The answer is
1.0244.
</P>
<P>
   Now, multiply that result by 200 _ don't ask why, just do it _
which in this example gives you 204.88. Then subtract 200 (again,
don't ask), which in your example leaves 4.88. That figure _ 4.88
percent _ is the average annual yield to maturity.
</P>
<P>
   With other maturity dates and other prices, the annual yield may
differ.
</P>

 Corporations Fight Internet `Cybersmear'
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Jon Swartz &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Corporations are declaring war in court to clear their names from
``cybersmear'' accusations.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest legal action, Liviakis Financial Communications of
Sacramento late yesterday filed a lawsuit in Marin Superior Court
to curb damaging statements on the Internet about the firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cybersmear'' is a practice in which individuals post malicious
messages about businesses in online forums, to manipulate the stock
or to hurt a company they have a grievance against. The
perpetrators often are disgruntled ex-workers or short sellers
attempting to manipulate stock.
</P>
<P>
   The Liviakis suit accuses 100 unnamed defendants _ who used such
online handles as ``ChiliBob,'' ``Kiddollars,'' ``Mr.Pink'' and
``Harvly'' _ of defamation and unfair business practices. In one
posting, John Liviakis, CEO of the $47 million public-relations
firm, is called a ``pedophile'' and ``swindler.'' In another, the
suit says, Liviakis is accused of ``unlawful short selling of
stock, unethical `dumping' of stock and market manipulation.''
</P>
<P>
   The 16-page complaint seeks unspecified compensatory and
punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Lizbeth Hasse, a San Francisco attorney representing Liviakis,
said several of the company's clients _ including Data Race, a
communications company in San Antonio, Texas _ also have ``been
hurt by incredibly damaging stuff'' on Yahoo and the Silicon
Investor site in March and April.
</P>
<P>
   The messages erroneously said Data Race executives were selling
off stock in Data Race or had resigned, according to Hasse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know if there's one person behind it or 10,'' said
Hasse, who is preparing to subpoena Yahoo and Silicon Investor, a
financial chat site, for the e-mail addresses of the people who
posted statements on the message boards. ``This is nasty, prurient
material.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Skalla, Data Race chief financial officer, said the company
is ``frustrated and irritated'' by the messages.
</P>
<P>
   The Marin case highlights the awkward position of Yahoo and
other Web sites with bulletin boards. While the boards allow for
anonymous free speech, they can be a source of misleading
information that can affect company stock prices or harm
reputations. It also underscores how the Net has become a powerful
medium for anyone _ sometimes anonymously _ to spread misleading
information and gossip to millions of people.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's suit comes on the heels on the most elaborate cyber
hoax yet. Last week, an unidentified person manipulated the stock
of PairGain Technologies Ltd., a Southern Californian
communications gear maker, by creating a Web site that looked like
a Bloomberg news wire article saying the company was about to be
acquired. (Yesterday, Bloomberg LP, which denied it posted such a
story, filed a lawsuit against the unidentified people who posted
the bogus report.)
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission confirmed last week that
it is investigating the PairGain case.
</P>
<P>
   And, in many cases, companies are suing unnamed individuals to
put a lid on rumors. Lawyers said it is the only way to track down
and stop the e-mail users. In each case, Yahoo Finance _ a popular
chat area where consumers exchange tips and gossip _ was accused of
serving as a breeding ground for malicious rumors and speculation
about companies.
</P>
<P>
   For example:
</P>
<P>
   _On Friday, the Shoney Corp. restaurant chain sued ``John Does
1-3'' over inflammatory messages posted on Yahoo Finance.
Fraudulently signed with the names of Shoney's founder, CEO and
chairman, the messages claimed the Nashville company may file for
bankruptcy and close restaurants, according to the suit. Shoney's
has asked Davidson County Chancery Court in Tennessee to subpoena
Yahoo to turn over the names of the e-mail authors.
</P>
<P>
   _Wade Cook Financial Corp. last month filed a slander suit
against 10 as-yet unidentified users, who in January allegedly
claimed on Yahoo Finance that Wade Cook, who runs the Seattle
investment advice firm, had been arrested for accepting kickbacks
from companies he touted online.
</P>
<P>
   _ITEX, a Portland, Ore., online financial services company, is
suing two former employees for $1.5 million for purportedly
claiming on Yahoo that ITEX is in deep financial trouble and that
its management is ``corrupt.''
</P>
<P>
   ITEX obtained a subpoena forcing Yahoo to track down the
message-board users' e-mail addresses. After Yahoo complied, ITEX
gained a court order to force Internet service providers to divulge
the names of the individuals who posted the messages.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo does not monitor its approximately 1,000 bulletin boards
and chat rooms that post tens of thousands of messages daily and
``doesn't intend to,'' said Mike Riley, senior producer of Yahoo
Finance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're unmoderated public forums,'' Riley said. ``To take an
anonymous post and then trade on it isn't smart. Take these message
boards for what they are _ not a reputable source of information.
You don't know who the other person is or their motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo's only warning to consumers is a disclaimer that says all
of the information on its bulletin boards may not be correct.
Individuals found guilty of spreading false statements face
eviction from Yahoo's service, according to company rules.
</P>
<P>
   The Communications Decency Act protects Yahoo and other Web
sites from being sued for libel for false statements that appear on
their bulletin boards and chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  When such statements affect stock prices, the SEC is
responsible for policing them. But state and federal authorities
have been slow to investigate cybersmear cases, industry observers
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called the SEC earlier this month, and they treated it like
an isolated instance,'' said Hasse, the San Francisco attorney
representing Liviakis. ``I guess PairGain changed that.''
</P>
<P>
   The posting online of a bogus Bloomberg ``article,'' which
claimed PairGain was being acquired by Israeli-owned ECI Telecom
Ltd. for $1.35 billion, sent PairGain stock on a wild ride.
</P>
<P>
   Over just a few hours on Wednesday, its shares soared 32 percent
to $11.13, before slumping to $9.38 after the story was exposed as
a fake.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel violated and terribly irritated,'' said Charles
McBrayer, chief financial officer of PairGain. ``Maybe this has
finally awakened the feds about what goes on in chat rooms and on
the Net.''
</P>
<P>
   However, PairGain doesn't plan to sue the unknown cyber
perpetrators. ``We're plenty pissed off, but it would be difficult
to prove our stock was damaged,'' McBrayer said.

 Compaq Stock Tumbles on Profit Warning
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By David Einstein &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Houston, you have a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Compaq Computer, the world leader in personal
computers, plummeted more than 20 percent yesterday as investors
reacted to the announcement that first-quarter profits will be half
of analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   No fewer than 10 brokerages downgraded Compaq's stock amid
grumbling that the Houston company had pulled a fast one by waiting
until after the close of trading on Friday to sound its earnings
warning _ even though the quarter ended more than a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq fell $6.81 to $24.13 yesterday on volume of nearly 100
million shares, making it the most heavily traded U.S. stock. The
shares have lost more than half of their value since late January,
when they hit a 52-week high of $49.25.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful that Compaq's misfortune could portend a slowdown for
the PC industry, investors also knocked down the stocks of other
top companies. Dell slid $1.74 to $41.81, despite predictions it
will meet quarterly expectations. Hewlett-Packard fell $1.38 to
$68.25, Gateway lost $2.88 to $69.88, and Intel, which makes the
chips for most PCs, fell $4.25 to $61.25.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts insisted that the PC business as a whole is
healthy and that Compaq's problems are mostly its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see a lot of problem with the other companies,'' said
Tim Ghriskey, a senior portfolio manager at Dreyfus.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq on Friday warned that its first-quarter revenues will be
about $9.4 billion _ 6 percent less than the $10 billion Wall
Street had expected. Earnings will be around 15 cents a share,
compared to 31 cents a share expected by Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with analysts yesterday, Compaq chief
executive Eckhard Pfeiffer attributed the company's troubles to
weak demand in the PC industry, competitive pricing and the shift
toward lower-margin products.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq appears to have contributed to its own dilemma by slicing
PC prices in an effort to fend off Dell, HP and other companies
that have been gaining market share. Despite its price cuts, Compaq
has lost business to other companies that offer entry-level PCs for
less than $500.
</P>
<P>
   On other fronts, as well, Compaq has run into difficulty:
</P>
<P>
   _It has yet to reap the benefits of its $8.4 billion takeover of
Digital Equipment _ a deal that Compaq hoped would enable it to
compete head-to-head with IBM for big corporate accounts by
offering extensive service along with computing equipment.
</P>
<P>
   _It seems to have gotten itself into a no-win situation by
trying to emulate the direct-sales approach of Dell while also
continuing to sell through distributors and retailers. The strategy
may have confused customers while irking channel partners who don't
like the idea of working with a PC-maker that's also competing for
their business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compaq's hybrid model of part direct and part indirect is not
working well,'' said analyst Steven Milunovich of Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   _The company has yet to define its Internet strategy. Compaq
owns AltaVista, a major search engine, and recently purchased
Shopping.com, an e-commerce site, for $220 million. But industry
observers are unimpressed with Shopping.com's volatile history and
lack of profits, and so far Compaq has yet to leverage the Internet
components into its overall business strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Kimball Brown of Dataquest figures it could take Compaq
two more quarters to get things straightened out. ``It's really
hard to execute on all these things at once, and their message is
blurred because they're feeling their way,'' he said. ``But I think
this is the low point.''
</P>
<P>
   Compaq's poor quarter seems certain to cast a pall over the
company's annual sales and marketing conference, Innovate Forum
'99, which begins today in Houston. The event was to serve as an
opportunity for Pfeiffer to expound on Compaq's plans for
Web-enabled corporate computing.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he may find himself answering questions about how
earnings could drop 50 percent.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ An Atlanta kindergarten teacher, a biographer of
Charles Lindbergh and a writer who spent 20 years researching the
geologic history of North America were awarded Pulitzer Prizes on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher, Margaret Edson, was awarded the prize for drama,
for her intricately layered play, ``Wit,'' which chronicles a
college professor's death from cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The Pulitzer Board gave the award for biography to A. Scott
Berg's ``Lindbergh,'' a book that examined the aviator's complex
life, from his 1927 one-man flight from New York to Paris to his
Nazi sympathies, a transformation one onlooker at the time
described with the phrase ``from Jesus to Judas.''
</P>
<P>
   John McPhee, a staff writer at The New Yorker for 34 years and a
professor at Princeton University, won the general nonfiction award
for ``Annals of the Former World,'' a 696-page examination of the
geologic life of North America.
</P>
<P>
   Two prizes were awarded to The New York Times. Maureen Dowd, an
Op-Ed page columnist, won the award for commentary for a series of
columns on the national impact of President Clinton's affair with
Monica Lewinsky and his pursuit by the independent prosecutor. The
award for national reporting was given to the staff, with a special
mention for Jeff Gerth, for a series of articles that reported that
despite national security risks, two aerospace companies had
improperly shared expertise with China with the approval of the
U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   The prize for editorial writing was awarded to the editorial
board of The New York Daily News, for its campaign to rescue the
Apollo Theater in Harlem from financial mismanagement. It was the
newspaper's third Pulitzer in the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press won the prize in feature photography for
its collection of photographs of the major figures and events
stemming from Clinton's affair with Ms. Lewinsky. And for the first
time, a single news organization won both prizes for photography:
The AP was also awarded the prize for spot news photography for its
portfolio of images following the embassy bombings in Kenya and
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   The prize for investigative reporting went to the staff of The
Miami Herald for revealing pervasive voter fraud in a city mayoral
election. The results of the election were later overturned.
</P>
<P>
   The award for beat reporting was given to Chuck Philips and
Michael Hiltzik of The Los Angeles Times for their stories on
corruption in the entertainment industry, including articles about
a sham sponsored by the National Academy of Recording Arts and
Sciences and the resurgence of payola in the radio industry.
</P>
<P>
   The award for international reporting was given to the staff of
The Wall Street Journal for the newspaper's coverage of the Russian
financial crisis. The Hartford (Conn.) Courant staff was given the
award for breaking news reporting, for its coverage of a shooting
rampage in which a state lottery worker killed four supervisors and
then committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The staff of The Washington Post won the award for public
service, for a series that identified and analyzed patterns of
reckless gunplay by city police officers who were inadequately
trained or supervised.
</P>
<P>
   The prizes are administered by the Columbia University Graduate
School of Journalism.
</P>
<P>
   The Pulitzer administrator, Seymour Topping, said the singling
out of Gerth from among six reporters was rare for a staff award,
which is given to work produced by more than three reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we see an instance where a reporter has done very
outstanding work and carried a great deal of the burden of the
story, we adjust the citation to take note of that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two decades, Gerth has been at the forefront of
the nation's investigative reporting. In 1992, he wrote the
original story on the financial dealings of the president and Mrs.
Clinton in the failed Arkansas real estate venture known as
Whitewater.
</P>
<P>
   The award for feature writing was given to Angelo Henderson of
The Wall Street Journal. Richard Read of The Oregonian in Portland,
Ore., was awarded the prize for explanatory reporting.
</P>
<P>
   In a year that was notable for long novels introduced with great
public-relations fanfare _ like Tom Wolfe's ``Man in Full'' _
Michael Cunningham's book ``The Hours,'' a slim novel that arrived
quietly, won the fiction award for its retelling of Virginia
Woolf's ``Mrs. Dalloway'' from three perspectives.
</P>
<P>
   The prize for history was awarded to ``Gotham: A History of New
York City to 1898'' by Edwin Burrows and Mike Wallace. Mark Strand
won the award for poetry, for his volume titled ``Blizzard of
One.''
</P>
<P>
   And a special posthumous citation was bestowed on Edward Kennedy
Ellington, the jazz legend better known as Duke.
</P>
<P>
   The citation states: ``Bestowed posthumously on Edward Kennedy
(Duke) Ellington, commemorating the centennial year of his birth,
in recognition of his musical genius, which evoked aesthetically
the principles of democracy through the medium of jazz and thus
made an indelible contribution to art and culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edson, speaking from the office of the assistant principal
at Centennial Place Elementary School in Atlanta, said she was told
of the award as she was cleaning up after a class project about
insects. She said she would tell her kindergarten class about the
prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, as much as they get the idea of the Pulitzers, they
will be very pleased,'' she said, adding that she had no plans to
quit her job as a kindergarten teacher.

 WASHINGTON:   of anonymity. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although clouds have once again hampered strikes, NATO carried
out more air raids Monday night, striking refineries in the city of
Novi Sad in northeast Serbia and at Pancevo, not far from the
capital, Belgrade, according to the Yugolsav news agency. There
were also reports of explosions in Pristina, the provincial capital
of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Although Yugoslavia's air defenses have been mounting an
intensified challenge to aircraft, NATO has not lost a warplane
since an F-117 stealth fighter was shot down more than two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Secretary of Defense William Cohen said Monday that
NATO aircraft had achieved ``tactical maneuverability'' over
Yugoslavia. ``This allows us to fly where we want and when we want
with acceptable risk,'' Cohen said, speaking at Barksdale Air Force
Base in Louisiana during a visit with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The weakening of Yugoslav air defenses is what has enabled Clark
to envision widening the strikes, the officials said. Clark
signaled his plans last week in an interview at NATO's military
headquarters in Mons, Belgium, saying Yugoslavia remained a potent
enemy with ``many, many targets'' still to be hit.
</P>
<P>
   The increase is clearly intended to have a psychological effect,
as well as a military one, signaling NATO's resolve to inflict
still more damage as efforts to find a diplomatic solution get
underway in Brussels and other capitals.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the warplanes, the United States and other NATO
powers are increasing other forces on the ground around Yugoslavia.
Pentagon officials said Monday that 4,800 Army soldiers are now
expected to accompany the two dozen Apache helicopter gunships
being sent to Albania.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon had initially said the Apaches would be accompanied
by only 2,000 troops. A senior Army official said the growing
number of troops reflected concerns about security in northern
Albania, close to the Yugoslav border, as well as the difficulty of
creating a base for the helicopters in Albania, which is Europe's
least developed country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going into Albania, the middle of nowhere, with no
infrastructure,'' the official said, adding that the exact number
of soldiers headed to Albania was still being worked out.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid growth in the force that will accompany the Apache
helicopters has also contributed to their slow deployment. A week
after NATO approved their use, officials have said it could take a
month before the full force is ready to strike inside Yugoslavia,
though Monday they said at least some helicopters could be ready
within the next seven to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Britain is also expected to announce that it plans to send
another 2,000 to 3,000 troops _ along with 20 tanks and 50 armored
personnel carriers _ to the NATO force it leads in Macedonia, a
NATO diplomat said. That force, originally the vanguard of a
planned peacekeeping force in Kosovo, now totals about 12,000
troops. Most of them are involved in providing aid to the thousands
of Albanians driven from their villages in Kosovo by the campaign
of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's armed forces have heavily fortified their positions
throughout Kosovo, according to NATO and Pentagon officials, and
this is complicating efforts to destroy tanks and other armored
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Aerial photographs have confirmed reports from refugees fleeing
Kosovo that Yugoslav forces are laying mines along Kosovo's
borders, digging trenches and building bunkers, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States and NATO continue to rule out the use
of ground forces against Yugoslavia, the fortification suggested
that the military and armed police forces in Kosovo have shifted
their tactics from a campaign to drive Kosovo Albanians from their
homes to a consolidation of their gains as NATO has pressed its air
and missile strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen various signs of hunkering down,'' a Defense
official said. ``There's been new mining. There are new bunkers.''
</P>
<P>
   Another American official with access to intelligence reports
said the Yugoslav Army had dug in along both major routes into the
country from Macedonia, apparently in preparation for an invasion
from NATO troops. The entrenchment of forces was reported on the
road from the Macedonian capital, Skopje, into Kosovo and on the
road from Macedonia to Nis, which is in Serbia proper.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav tactics have made it more difficult to strike. ``To
the extent they go underground,'' one official said of the evidence
that new bunkers are being constructed, ``it doesn't make it any
easier.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon also released aerial photographs showing armored
vehicles parked in the middle of two villages, Malisevo and
Volujak, a tactic that the Yugoslav Army appears to have been using
to shield its forces from attacks by NATO forces wary of causing
large numbers of civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ``So they are actually parking their vehicles in among the
villages in some places, which is bad because it is hard to find
them and you have to really watch for collateral damage,'' said
Maj. Gen. Charles F. Wald, the deputy director of strategic plans
and policy for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. ``But it's also good
because it means he is hunkered down and not moving around very
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Although NATO jets have begun to strike some ground forces,
including columns of armored vehicles, NATO's strategy is to
whittle away at the Yugoslav supply lines, which are easier to find
and hit, while letting the forces in the field wither. Wald said
Monday that the strikes had destroyed ``100 percent'' of the Serb's
ability to produce petrolium products for the military.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing has also hurt the Yugoslav air defenses, he said,
especially their ability to use and replace their surface-to-air
missiles. He said that despite the poor weather over the Balkans,
allied war planes were flying ``quite a few'' bombing missions and
using all the weapons in their arsenal. He said NATO had struck 24
targets over the previous two days, far less than the number
attacked when the skies over the Balkans were clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The army and police have been reduced,'' he said. ``Their
coordinated air defense has been impacted, I would say, in a big
way. Some of their TV reception, from a military standpoint, from
their command and control standpoint, has been degraded. The losses
are continuing.''

 &HT;    CONGRESS PUTS OFF DEBATE ON KOSOVO
 &HT;    380&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional leaders, meeting with President
Clinton on Monday after their spring recess, postponed for at least
a week a debate over authorizing ground troops in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Leadership of both parties emerged from the 90-minute White
House session saying they were determined to give President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia no comfort by showing cracks in
support for the U.S. troops and the NATO action on behalf of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., who weeks
ago voted against the bombing campaign, offered hints that he is
far from persuaded on the U.S. role in the conflict. He said he
found the public ``quizzical'' as he traveled during the two-week
recess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that they're not certain exactly what our national
security interests are,'' Lott said. He said Americans feel
sympathy for the suffering refugees, ``but I think they're still
not certain why we're there.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid calls from some members of both parties to authorize an
immediate insertion of ground troops into the region, Lott said he
expected Congress to take a formal vote before any forces were sent
to fight their way into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think we're at that point yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis J. Hastert, R-Ill., said he too expected to
have a formal debate, including one over whether the administration
was conforming to the War Powers Act _ but not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It think we need to see how this thing progresses,'' the
speaker said. His own party is divided among those who want to give
the president more authority to ``win'' the war, those who want no
expansion beyond the current bombing campaign, and those who want
to halt the fighting altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leaders, by contrast, stood rock-solid behind the
president's handling of the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to give up,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom
Daschle of South Dakota. ``We're going to hang in there until this
job is done.''
</P>
<P>
   Without mentioning the potential for ground troops, House
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri restated the president's
demands that Milosevic clear his troops out of Kosovo and allow the
refugees to return home under the protection of an international
force.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt asserted, ``That's what we want, and we're united in
sticking with that policy until we accomplish it.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   For all of the solidarity, however, some of the leaders were
clearly picking their words carefully. House Majority Leader Dick
Armey, R-Texas, repeatedly praised the troops for their ``high
morale'' and for the ``size of their hearts'' in the effort to
assist Kosovo's refugees. He avoided saying anything in support of
the military operation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton continues his consultations with Congress on Tuesday,
when he is scheduled to meet with members of military and foreign
affairs committees.
</P>
<P>
   At Monday's White House session, the leaders were given a
briefing on the air war, but no cost estimate for the operation.
Unofficial estimates go as high as $40 million a day, which would
soon put the total near $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said he expected the administration to seek the funding
soon as part of an emergency supplemental bill that includes aid to
Central American victims of Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   Less certain is how the Congress and the White House would find
budget savings to offset the added military costs. The choices, all
of them unpopular, include trimming other military spending, making
cuts in other programs, reducing Republican plans for tax cuts, or
slicing off some of the Social Security surplus that all parties
have vowed not to touch.

MARKET PLACE: AT GM, SPECULATION ON CHAIRMAN'S SUCCESSOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Harry Pearce, the vice chairman of General Motors
Corp., has largely recovered from leukemia and is again a leading
candidate to succeed John F. Smith Jr., GM's chairman and chief
executive, who turned 61 last Tuesday, auto industry executives
said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith had been delegating considerable responsibility this year
to Pearce, 56, and to Richard Wagoner Jr., 46, who became GM's
president and chief operating officer in October. Wagoner is likely
to play a prominent but slightly more junior role in combination
with Pearce after Smith retires, said industry officials, all of
whom insisted on anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's increasing delegation of responsibility and often
visible weariness have prompted considerable speculation here that
he might retire, possibly within the next year. He has avoided
giving any clear, public indication of whether he would like to
stay until he turns 65. Steven Harris, GM's vice president for
worldwide communications, said Monday that Smith had ``no plans at
this point'' to retire.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing discussions of Smith's eventual successor come as GM
is profiting handsomely from a vigorous economy. But the world's
largest automaker is also losing market share at home, partly
because it failed to foresee the strength of demand for full-sized
pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles. The company's stock has
risen sharply since the end of a crippling, two-month strike last
summer but has generally trailed shares of GM's archrival, Ford
Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   GM's shares rose $2.50, to $88.125 on Monday as the company
announced that next month it would spin off its 82.3 percent stake
in its auto-parts division, Delphi Automotive Systems Corp. The
United Automobile Workers union has opposed the spinoff but
declined to comment Monday afternoon on GM's action.
</P>
<P>
   J.T. Battenberg III, Delphi's chairman and chief executive, said
that Pearce ``has been an active participant'' in the spinoff.
</P>
<P>
   Pearce, a lawyer who rose through the general counsel's office
at GM, is again playing a central role in setting GM's strategy,
officials said. He is guiding policy on a wide range of issues,
including the spin-off of Delphi, while overseeing subsidiaries
like Hughes Electronics and tackling strategic problems that are
not part of the daily management of the auto business, which
Wagoner handles.
</P>
<P>
   Pearce was diagnosed early last summer with leukemia, but
continued doing considerable work from home so as to remain
involved with the company. He said in a brief telephone
conversation last week that he was feeling fine and on the path to
recovery; he has begun giving interviews again this month as the
company presents him as once more a physically fit executive able
to carry broad responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Steven J. Harris, GM's vice president for worldwide
communications, said Monday that that no decision had been made on
who would become GM's next chairman. He said that Pearce was
working at least four days a week now, characterizing that schedule
as ``full time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is back full time and fully engaged _ as far as what he'll
be doing longer term, that is for the board,'' he said. ``The board
routinely and regularly discusses succession issues, but there's
nothing new to report.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearce was treated at the Mayo Clinic. Dr. Esperanza
Papadopoulos, a bone-marrow specialist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center in New York, said that many leukemia patients fully
recover from their illnesses these days, particularly those who
receive early treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Papadopoulos said that while she had not treated Pearce, it
was ``certainly possible'' that he was well on the way to a full
recovery, although it might take one to five years to be completely
certain, with the period depending on the type of leukemia and the
treatments used.
</P>
<P>
   After Pearce began bone-marrow treatments for his illness,
Smith's successor had appeared to be Wagoner, who had been GM's
executive vice president for North American automotive operations
before becoming GM's president and chief operating officer last
October. But Pearce is much better known among board members than
Wagoner and a decade older; Wagoner is the youngest member of GM's
board by three years.
</P>
<P>
   Wagoner is also relatively little known to the board. He became
a member last autumn and attended meetings infrequently in previous
years. By contrast, Pearce has been a favorite with many board
members since becoming general counsel in 1987, frequently
attending board meetings thereafter because of the numerous legal
issues the automaker faced, a former GM board member said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry did an outstanding job and he came to the attention of
the board,'' the former board member said. Pearce joined the board
in January 1996, when he became vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely scenario is that Pearce will play the senior
role in some sort of partnership with Wagoner, with Pearce serving
as chairman and possibly as chief executive for a while too,
several auto-industry officials said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The result would be the latest in a series of two-person
leadership teams at big automakers, an approach that Ford and
DaimlerChrysler AG are using now and that GM itself tried from 1992
through 1995, when Smith was GM's chief executive but John Smale, a
powerful outside director, was GM's non-executive chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Bennis, a business professor at the University of
Southern California and the author of a recent book on dual leaders
at large corporations, said that automakers were particularly
suited to such leadership because of their sheer size. GM is the
world's largest company in terms of sales and Ford is the
second-largest.
</P>
<P>
   Always reluctant to be in the spotlight, Smith has cut back his
public appearances even more than usual this year. Wagoner gave
most of the company's semiannual presentation to Wall Street
analysts in January, with Smith making only a few, brief remarks.
Wagoner also gave the keynote speech at the New York International
Auto Show earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Conspicuously absent from auto-industry officials' discussions
of who might succeed Smith is Louis Hughes, GM's executive vice
president for new business strategies. The new title, which does
not include operational responsibilities, was created for Hughes in
October when his previous job, overseeing GM's international
automotive operations, was added to Wagoner's responsibilities.
Hughes was a finalist for the post of chairman of United Airlines
earlier this spring.

 &HT;    Bills target women's medical rights
 &HT;    By Marcia Gelbart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Four years ago, when she was still in the
Florida House, Mandy Dawson-White helped create a law allowing
women insured by health maintenance organizations to select a
gynecologist as their primary care physician. Now the Fort
Lauderdale Democrat is at it again.
</P>
<P>
   Elected to the Senate in March, Dawson-White is pushing a bill
that would guarantee women direct access to a gynecologist
regardless of whom they choose as a primary doctor.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was one of two bills passed Monday by the Senate
Banking and Insurance Committee that seeks to broaden women's
medical rights.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jim Sebesta, R-St. Petersburg, cited his wife's own
protracted battle with breast cancer in urging the 12-member panel
_ which includes two women _ to support Dawson-White's bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a dickens of a time getting by the gatekeepers,'' he
said about referrals required by primary care physicians before a
woman can see a gynecologist.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Sens. Jim King, R-Jacksonville and Pat Thomas,
D-Tallahassee voted against the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Noting their dissension after the hearing, Dawson-White blamed
their stance on their gender. ``They would probably vote `yes' if
they had boobs and ovaries,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The second bill, sponsored by Sen. Patsy Kurth, D-Palm Bay,
would require health insurers to provide coverage for birth control
pills, which cost $20 to $30 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Both measures drew opposition from insurance companies, who said
the bills would drive up their costs and possibly force small
businesses to drop their health plans.
</P>
<P>
   Sebesta, one of four opponents of Kurth's bill, compared birth
control pills to sunglasses, saying, ``They're a matter of choice;
they're not drugs, they're not medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the vote, Kurth said Sebesta's remark ``showed an
insensitivity to what women go through.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurth said she introduced the bill after learning that 49
percent of insurance companies that pay for prescriptions exclude
oral contraceptives.

   Also voting against the bill: Sen. Tom Rossin, D-West Palm

Rossin later said he wanted more details about the impact on small

 &HT;    Hillary Clinton to dine in Wexler's honor
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ U.S. Rep. Robert Wexler, who traveled the
national talk show circuit defending President Clinton during his
impeachment hearing and trial, is raising money for his reelection
campaign tonight with a dinner featuring first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The $1,000 per person dinner is at the Boca Raton Resort and
Club.
</P>
<P>
   Wexler, a Boca Raton Democrat seeking a third term, was one of
the president's loudest supporters, although he said he was
bitterly disappointed about Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the dinner, Wexler and Mrs. Clinton will participate in
a Holocaust memorial program at the Jewish Federation of South Palm
Beach County.
</P>
<P>
   The Yom Hashoah ceremony, which began at sundown Monday and ends
at sundown today, remembers the millions of Jews killed during the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner is a purely political event. Wexler has said that
instead of running for a third term he might run for the seat held
by U.S. Sen. Connie Mack, who is retiring. Wexler has indicated
that such a run is a long shot, but he wants to take a careful look
at the race. The front-runner for the Democratic nomination is
state Insurance Commissioner Bill Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton should find a receptive audience here, particularly
among former New Yorkers who are wondering whether she will run for
the U.S. Senate there.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton has said she is seriously considering a race for
the seat held by Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan who is retiring
after 24 years in the Senate.

GOING, GOING ... BIDDING FOR BARGAINS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 18) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By L.R. SHANNON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On-line auctions are a growing segment of the Web. A pioneer,
Ebay, started in 1995 and now lists a couple of hundred thousand
items every day; Amazon.com, which began life as a bookseller,
recently cobbled on an auction subsection.
</P>
<P>
   With these merchandise auctions, the Web site acts as a
go-between for individuals selling and individuals buying. Sites
that offer travel include Onsale; Adventurebid, which, as its name
implies, specializes in such excursions as white-water rafting,
ballooning and climbing; Bid4vacations, with cruises, skiing and
ranches that take guests; Luxurylink, with high-priced hotels and
other destinations; Goinggoinggone, a potpourri, and others.
</P>
<P>
   The better-known Priceline is not a true auction site; you offer
a price for an airline ticket or hotel room, and if a company
accepts it, it lets Priceline know. By and large, in travel sites
you are dealing with established companies, not individuals, which
can increase confidence. Still, flexible travel plans are usually
essential.
</P>
<P>
   Most of my auction experience comes from comic strips, where an
unconscious twitch or sniffle raises your bid for an antique
whatzit by thousands of dollars. But a two-night stay for two
people at a five-star European hotel seemed too good not to try
for, at least at first glance. And since the auction was on the
Web, I could scratch an itch without inadvertently bidding. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The site holding out this temptation was Onsale, www.onsale.com,
which sells thousands of things outright, computer products in
particular, as well as sports and fitness gear and home and office
stuff, and has added auctions to the mix. The At Auction travel
section offers many deals. Cruises are a major ingredient, and 10
were listed _ Scandinavian, Aegean and Tahitian among them _ and
five other travel offers were highlighted. I clicked on one that
said ``2-Night Stay for Two/Five-Star Hotels/Europe/Bids Start at
$9.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I found that there were a total of four five-star hotels
available in four different cities; that the ostensible list price
for the accommodations was $650, and that the current bids were in
the $49 to $109 range (bidding starts at $9, but goes up only in
$10 increments). Five high bidders were listed by initials and
hometowns: A.G. of Newport Beach, Calif., had offered $109. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The four hotels were in Ankara, Turkey; Goteborg, Sweden;
Luxembourg and Stockholm, cities not at the top of most people's
choice of destinations, and the rooms were ``based on
availability.'' Onsale went on: ``The Five-Star Hotels are part of
a well-known international chain, but since Onsale is offering such
an incredible deal to its customers, we can't use the name!''
</P>
<P>
   Well, OK, I guess. In the detailed rundowns on each of the
otherwise unidentified hotels, it turned out that the hotel in
Goteborg is less than 13 miles from the airport and the one in
Stockholm is 22 miles from the airport, but the place in Ankara is
``just minutes'' from the airport and the one in Luxembourg is in
the airport. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Flexibility is essential: the trip must be made before July 31.
``You will receive an e-mail within four business days requesting
your top three date choices and your destination,'' Onsale says.
``Confirmation will be given within four days.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even though you don't know the name or location of the hotel you
are bidding for a room in, you can't do it anonymously yourself.
You must register with Onsale, giving your name and address, day
and evening phone numbers, fax number, e-mail address and
credit-card information, concocting a user name and password. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Trying to be a little less ambitious, I also dipped into a
two-night cruise from New York to nowhere in an outside stateroom,
the ``best available at time of booking,'' aboard Premier Cruise's
Seabreeze, with an official price of $1,156. Bids ranged from $359
to $369. Down in the fine print it was noted that a ``port charge
of $89.50 per person will be charged in addition to the winning bid
price,'' a substantial fraction if the $369 bid wins.

CAMBODIA, NOW AT PEACE, HOPES FOR TOURISTS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 18) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ From time to time these days, an
unfamiliar sight appears on the streets of this threadbare,
battle-weary city: a tour bus.
</P>
<P>
   There is really not that much to see here: small temples, small
marketplaces, reminders of the Khmer Rouge ``killing fields'' of
the 1970s. But Cambodia is a country of warmth and rural beauty, a
glimpse back into the Indochina of the past that so attracted
outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   And now, for the first time in nearly 30 years, it is a country
at peace. The Khmer Rouge insurgency is dead, and the last
upheavals of the civil war that followed it seem finally to have
sputtered out.
</P>
<P>
   It is a question now of convincing tourists and tour operators
abroad that Cambodia is no longer a danger spot _ although rural
banditry, urban crime and occasional flare-ups of political
violence will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that tourism is going to increase,'' said
Jacques Guichandut, managing director of Diethelm Travel in
Cambodia. ``A lot of things have changed since 1997.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that travel to Cambodia through Diethelm had increased
by 48 percent over the past year as the country began to stabilize
after a coup and a violent, disputed election. Though no reliable
figures are available for travel to Siem Reap, the site of the
temples of Angkor, tour groups also began to return to Angkor Wat,
which had for a time been almost deserted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have just come back from promoting Cambodia in Europe,'' he
said. ``Still, we get the same questions: Is Cambodia safe or not?
So definitely, confidence is not back. They definitely ask about
mines. Before, tourists used to ask about the general political
situation. Today, the main concerns are about mines.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, land mines pose little danger to tourists. Though
millions of mines remain scattered through the country, they are in
remote and well-defined areas, unlikely to affect travelers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to worries about safety, tourism to Cambodia is
still hampered by poor infrastructure. Apart from Phnom Penh, the
capital, and Siem Reap, there are no first-class hotels. Roads are
poor, and air connections can be uncertain. Local food is often
excellent, but cleanliness is a concern.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Cambodia offers just one major tourist draw: the
magnificent 12th-century temple of Angkor Wat and the scores of
temple ruins that surround it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to strengthen infrastructure, we must diversify the
market more,'' said Cambodia's tourism minister, Veng Sereyvuth.
``It is not just Angkor Wat which is interesting. We need to
develop things like eco-tourism, the Tonle Sap. I am not saying we
can do it in 24 hours, but these things definitely need to be
upgraded.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke enthusiastically about developing part of the vast
Tonle Sap lake (the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia) as a
wildlife sanctuary, of building a road network to link Cambodia
with its neighbors, Thailand and Vietnam, and even of installing
trolleys to take visitors among the temples at Angkor.
</P>
<P>
   But at the moment, as with so many of its endeavors, Cambodia
seems to be focused on immediate gain rather than long-term
planning. It has permitted a Thai airline, Bangkok Air, to begin
direct flights from Bangkok to Siem Reap that allow tourists to fly
in for a day, see the temples and fly out again. This quick
money-earner for the entrepreneurs who put it in place is leading
growing numbers of visitors to bypass Phnom Penh and the rest of
the country entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the centuries-old battle between Thailand and
Cambodia for control of Angkor, some Cambodians see the direct
flights as a first step by the Thais to recolonize the temples _ in
this case as part of the package tours of the ``Amazing Thailand''
promotional campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some visitors may even think Angkor Wat is a part of
Thailand,'' said Jean-Pierre Kaspar, general manager of the Hotel
Sofitel Cambodiana in Phnom Penh. ``When they advertise the flights
in Thailand, they don't say much about Cambodia. Knowing how
aggressive the Thai tourism industry is, they may just take over
Angkor Wat.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bangkok Air has its way, one more direct route to Siem Reap
will begin this year, from the island resort of Phuket in southern
Thailand. For the Thais, who have tourists to spare, this will
relieve a problem with overbooking at the popular beach resort. For
the Cambodians, whose tourist industry hovers just above zero,
every dollar will count.

BRITISH SUMMER, CAMP INCLUDED  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 18) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By EMILY LAURENCE BAKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's sad but true: a lot of teen-agers would rather stay at home
with their friends than go on vacation with their parents _ even if
offered a trip to Europe. Unless you're prepared to leave the kids
at home with grandparents or cousins or send them to summer camp, a
European venture could be marred by gloomy faces and a perpetual
chorus of ``Oh, do we have to go there?'' One solution is to take
the kids to Europe _ and then pack them off on a mini-holiday of
their own. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Britain has a number of vacation packages for children ages 6 to
19. The mix of English and European children who attend British
summer programs could give an American child a window on foreign
cultures. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   British camps are likely to be housed in dormitories of vacant
colleges or school campuses. Activities tend to be outdoors, which
seems a bit odd in a rainy climate. But all programs offer
foul-weather alternatives. Nighttime activities are more likely to
be discos and drama than singing around the campfire. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because the British school term doesn't finish until early July,
most summer programs begin at the end of July and run through the
last week of August. The earlier weeks of the summer will have more
European children, while British children predominate in August.
Programs are structured by the week, but it's possible to stay
longer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is no one organization that regulates all aspects of
children's summer programs. But the Adventure Activities Licensing
Authority is a government body that issues licenses for most
outdoor pursuits, including water sports, climbing, caving, and
trekking.
</P>
<P>
   It monitors only adventure activities, so it's wise to make sure
that a summer program is registered with the British Activity
Holiday Association, which monitors general safety, cleanliness and
staffing of association members. Except for Marlborough College,
all the programs listed below meet the standards of one of these
two groups. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The largest children's adventure vacation company in Britain is
PGL, which runs programs at 23 sites in England, Wales, Scotland
and France. Children are divided into four age groups: 6 to 9, 8 to
13, 12 to 15 and 14 to 19, with about 12 children to a group
leader, although younger groups are smaller. Staff members are
trained by PGL under the guidance of national sports associations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Children can choose from standard multi-activity camps or study
one sport, such as golf, motorized karts or horseback riding. Beam
House, near Bideford on the Devon coast, is popular for water
sports, said Louise Freyer, a PGL spokeswoman. Children who visit
Tregoyd House in Wales can hike in the Black Mountains, while those
who attend Court Farm in Herefordshire can canoe on the River Wye
and sleep in converted brick farm buildings.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Themed weeks are popular, Mrs. Freyer said. On the Indiana Jones
holiday, children unravel clues to solve the pyramid puzzle while
using canoes, rappelling equipment and a zip line, or aerial wire.
Other theme weeks include Robin Hood, Down on the Farm and Action
Man. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The company's Double Decker trip to France for ages 12 to 18
includes three days of canoeing in the Ardeche Gorge followed by
three days of water sports on a Mediterranean beach near
Languedoc. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Club Correze, a tiny village on the Correze-Dordogne border,
children sleep in sandstone cottages. Activities include pony
trekking, climbing, sailing and windsurfing. In the southern French
Alps, 12- to 18-year-olds (in separate groups) camp in tents at
night and by day pursue vigorous sports, including white-water
rafting. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A PGL French-language holiday combines intense French lessons
with sports. Overseas holidays range from $495 to $688 a week,
including overnight bus and ferry transport from London. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Programs run from July 3 to Sept. 4. United Kingdom programs
start at $350 for one week up to $575. At some centers, weekends
are available from $135, three nights from $180 and four nights
from $220. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A more intimate experience can be found at Mill on the Brue, a
family-run activity center in rural Somerset. For 18 years, Tony
and Tricia Rawlingson Plant have sponsored programs to ``develop
the whole person'' through outdoor activities.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the year, the Rawlingson Plants are host to corporate
and independent groups, but in summer their 20 acres of land are
turned over to a maximum of 44 children. Activities include grass
skiing and tobogganing, kayaking, hiking, rafting and video
making. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Children 8 to 14 are divided into groups of 10 to 12 with a
staff member for every five. Each week there is a day trip to a
nearby town such as Bath or Bristol. Older children are taken on an
overnight hiking trip. Children usually stay for a week but can
come for a few days or two weeks. Boys and girls sleep in separate
buildings in rooms with 8 to 10 children.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Bailey, spokeswoman for the camp, said that about 70
percent of the children are British and the remaining 30 percent
Europeans, with a few Americans. Programs run from July 18 through
Sept. 4 and cost $516 a week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Camp Beaumont, a 19-year-old program, is similar to an American
summer camp. There are four camps in England, one of them on the
Isle of Wight, for children 6 to 16. Activities include water
sports, archery, motorized karts and other standard camp fare. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For young children who have never been away from home, Jane
Dumble, a camp spokeswoman, recommends Kingswood, in Staffordshire.
The program features numerous activities and it's possible to go
for three or four days. The London Country College campus in Surrey
features a soccer camp with professional players as visiting
instructors. In Norfolk, at Runton Sands, children attend circus
school in a big top with circus performers as instructors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Camp Beaumont owns a chateau in southern Normandy, where it
operates a program for children 9 to 16. The weekly price is $558,
including bus fare from London. Beaumont also has eight day camps
in the London area. There are separate programs for children 3 to
15, which include crafts, fencing and drama.
</P>
<P>
   The Wimbledon location is popular with Americans, Miss Dumble
said, because of its pickups in Knightsbridge and Kensington _
popular tourist areas. Day programs run from about 8:30 a.m. to
5:30 p.m., including bus travel. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Opening dates vary among campuses, but programs run from mid-
July to the end of August. Whitecliff Bay in the Isle of Wight
opens on June 19. Prices start at $478 a week for residential camps
and $253 for day camps. Some centers offer three- or four-day
packages that start at $215 and $285. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Experience UK (XUK) also runs day and half-day camps in north
London for children 3 to 14. Activities include singing, magic
shows, arts and crafts, drama, tennis and swimming. Children are
grouped by age with a staff-to-children ratio of 1 to 5. XUK also
has an overnight camp in a country mansion in Suffolk, about 120
miles northeast of London, for $415 a week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For a slightly more intellectual approach to summer, Marlborough
College Summer School in Wiltshire offers 200 courses for all ages
from July 18 to Aug. 7. Children 10 and over can go on their own
and stay for one to three weeks to study a single activity, like
golf or cooking, or pursue a variety in the general children's
programs. These are divided into five age groups: 3 to 6, 6 to 10,
10 to 12, 13 to 15 and 14 to 17.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many children attend with their parents; families can stay
together or in different dormitories so that they are ``independent
together,'' according to Marek Kwiatkowski, the director. Adults
might take a wine workshop or study history while the little ones
take Meddle With Magic or practice Art for Aliens.
</P>
<P>
   Dormitory accommodation for unaccompanied children is $184 a
week with a $96 weekend charge for those staying two weeks. Course
prices vary but most children's courses are about $135 a week. Two
courses fill the day. Round-trip bus transport is available from
London for $48. &QL;

 &HT;    Voluntary plan to limit air pollution advances
 &HT;    By Osler McCarthy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Countering one, two, three punches, the Senate
knocked out efforts Monday to limit a proposal that would allow
industrial air polluters to agree on their own to restrict their
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   After beating back three amendments, the Senate by 21-9 gave
preliminary approval to voluntary air-pollution permit procedures
for plants in operation before the state adopted air-quality
standards in 1971. The so-called grandfathered plants have not been
subject to the Clean Air Act.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush's support for the measure was framed as a
test of his environmental policy by environmental lobbies opposed
to the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of Senate Bill 766, sponsored by state Sen. J.E.
``Buster'' Brown, R-Lake Jackson, contend the legislation allows
some of the state's worst air polluters to decide whether to clean
up their emissions. Opponents say it also continues a fee schedule
that lets the worst polluters pay state fees at the same rate as
lesser-polluting companies.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's bill would allow the plants that were not covered by the
1971 law voluntarily to seek an air-quality permit within two
years. The legislation would allow them to buy emissions-reducing
equipment that meets 10-year-old technology guidelines, instead of
the more recently designed equipment now required.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Royce West, D-Dallas, in one of the three failed
amendments, advocated requiring grandfathered plants that operate
near schools, nursing homes or parks to comply with strict
air-quality standards after two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't want to do it for the entire industry, . . . then
do it for our children,'' West urged.
</P>
<P>
   But senators rejected West's amendment, as well as one by state
Sen. Carlos Truan, D-Corpus Christi, and another by state Sen.
Rodney Ellis, D-Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Truan proposed eliminating a fee cap that allows polluters to be
assessed for no more than 4,000 tons of emissions spewed into the
air. ``This fee arrangement is giving the dirtiest companies in the
state incentive to pollute more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis' amendment would have forced compliance by plants that did
not seek a permit during the two-year voluntary period. Without a
``hammer'' for Texas' air-quality enforcement, Ellis said, the
state could lose federal highway construction money because of smog
problems in Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to make a bad bill better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown said his bill struck a balance that Ellis' amendment
would upset and Truan's proposal on a new fee structure should be
left to the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission to
devise. He offered to help West work on separate legislation to
accomplish the fee goals.
</P>
<P>
   Under Brown's bill, plants in operation before 1971 would have
to meet the air-quality standards that were in place 10 years
before they voluntarily apply for a permit. The plants, which would
have until Sept. 1, 2001, to sign up for the voluntary program,
would not be required by legislation to enter the program; however,
Brown said, they could face even stricter regulations if they did
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a shame that the Senate voted today for a policy
of letting the polluters decide whether or not to comply with our
clean air laws,'' said Peter Altman, Texas director of the
environmental group Sustainable Energy and Economic Development,
``especially at a time when more Texans than ever live in counties
that fail or are about to fail national air quality standards.''
</P>
<P>
   As many as 50 plants have pledged to apply for the permits.
About 1,000 of the state's 2,500 industrial plants are
grandfathered.
</P>
<P>
   Osler McCarthy writes for the Austin American-Statesman, Austin,
Texas.

Masters turns back on Love once more
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to Augusta National, Davis Love III can't get any
love.
</P>
<P>
   He's a Georgia native, loves the golf course, lives a couple
hours away by car and basically is the adopted son of the Masters.
Yet he may never win there.
</P>
<P>
   Love was one hooked tee shot from having a serious chance to win
at Augusta on Sunday. He smashed his drive at the par-5 13th into
the little tributary that trickles into Rae's Creek. There was only
a driplet or two of water in the gully that meanders down the left
side of the 13th, then crosses in front of the green. But it might
as well have been the mighty Mississippi when Love saw his ball
submerged in two inches of water.
</P>
<P>
   He still managed a par at that hole, but with his length, it was
a sure-fire birdie, if not an eagle, if he plays a good shot off
the tee.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the things that happen at Augusta, particularly to
Love. He lost the 1995 tournament to Ben Crenshaw by a stroke. That
was an emotional loss in which Love said that if he couldn't win,
he was glad it was Crenshaw who did.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Jose Maria Olazabal has won another green jacket in a
heartfelt story of returning from painful foot problems. Again,
Love said that if he couldn't win, he's glad it was Olazabal on the
victory platform.
</P>
<P>
   But enough is enough. Love is getting a little tired of being
the nice guy finishing second. It gets no easier with experience.
In fact, it probably is tougher.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't come to the Masters to finish second,'' Love said.
``You don't make as many birdies as I did (18 over four rounds) and
expect to finish second. But it's another step in the right
direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are four or five guys who can say, `I could have won
very easily.' And I'm one of them. It's disappointing. But I'll
build on it.''
</P>
<P>
   There's not that much left to build on for Love, who now has
four consecutive top-10 finishes at Augusta. He was seventh in '96
and '97.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy for Jose Maria to come back from what he came
back from to win the Masters,'' Love said. ``I know he loves this
place. And after the start he had, to go all the way down to
4-under par and come back, I'm very happy for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, anything I would say is sour grapes.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is not Love's style. He'll just keep plugging away like he
has the past few years, rolling up one of the biggest bankrolls in
PGA Tour history. He's currently fifth on the all-time money list.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he ever wins a Masters or not, though, Love is
guaranteed a spot in Augusta lore after what he did Sunday. Making
his 12-yard chip shot from the left side of the 16th green was
probably the single most memorable shot from the '99 Masters. Love
bumped the ball out of medium-length grass onto the green about 15
feet beyond the hole. It came to rest on the incline that separates
the two plateaus of the green.
</P>
<P>
   Then it began it's slow, tantalizing drift back toward the lower
tier. As Greg Norman said: ``I saw that shot on replay and the ball
was moving so slow, you could count the dimples.''
</P>
<P>
   The ball made just enough revolutions to drop into the side door
of the cup for a most improbable birdie.
</P>
<P>
   But, as always with Love, it wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Love will head to Hilton Head, S.C., for the MCI
Classic at the Harbour Town Golf Links. He is returning to the
scene of his last victory, having won last year _ the week after
the Masters. He has 13 wins in the last dozen years and has won at
least once every year since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, he's come up empty, thanks again to the lack
of love from Augusta National.

Astros not starting to worry
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SAN FRANCISCO _ In 1986, the Astros began the season 3-3. They
finished with 96 victories, went to the playoffs and came up two
victories shy of a trip to the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, they broke out of the gate with a 6-0 start _ and
finished 10 games below .500.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the Astros opened with victories in five of their first
six games _ and finished 82-80, 12{ games out of first place.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Astros started 3-3 and stayed around .500 the
first three weeks of the season. They occupied sole possession of
first place the final 150 days of the regular season, won a
franchise-record 102 games and earned a second straight National
League Central Division championship.
</P>
<P>
   After starting with a less-than-impressive 3-3 homestand in
1999, the Astros open the road portion of their schedule against
the San Francisco Giants tonight at 3Com Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no sense in pressing or even worrying,'' center
fielder Carl Everett said.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it's not where you stand in April that matters. Check
back Oct. 3.
</P>
<P>
   If the season were based on one week, the Astros, Atlanta Braves
and Texas Rangers, division winners a year ago, wouldn't be among
the eight playoff qualifiers. Struggling, yes. Out of the race,
hardly.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the Astros could draw few, if any, conclusions
to losing two of three games to Chicago and barely slipping past
projected division doormat Milwaukee with two wins in three games.
</P>
<P>
   Their motto: ``Six of 162.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to win every game. That's the idea,'' first
baseman Jeff Bagwell said. ``You're not going to play well all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell pointed out that the New York Yankees began last season
0-3 and finished with a major-league record 125 victories (playoffs
included) and their 24th World Series championship.
</P>
<P>
   By the time of the Yankees' victory parade down the streets of
Manhattan in late October, few remembered where the Bronx Bombers
stood in the AL East standings on April 4 _ in last place.
</P>
<P>
   The source of the Astros' early-season woes can be attributed to
one eye-catching statistic _ 2.8 runs per game. They are batting
.246. Before they posted season highs of five runs and 13 hits on
Sunday, the average was .213 _ last in the NL.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't hitting. That's not us,'' said Everett, who leads
the team with a .364 average. ``We thrive off hitting. Teams come
in worrying how many hits the Astros are going to get today. We
hadn't done that the first five games.''
</P>
<P>
   The top of the Astros' order is where the hitting sag is most
obvious. Three of the top hitters _ Craig Biggio, Jeff Bagwell and
Ken Caminiti _ are batting a composite .175 (10-for-57) with one
home run and three RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we hit, I'll take it (a 3-3 start),'' Bagwell said.
``I think we hit as bad as we could hit in the first six games.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggio, who started the season 0-for-13 before hitting a home
run Saturday, said it's easy to assume something is wrong when the
bats are slow to heat up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a crazy homestand,'' said Biggio, who has hit .300 or
better in four of the past five seasons. ``It's not that we're flat
going out there. It might appear like we're not focused, but we
are. When you're not swinging the bats well it looks that way.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not unprecedented for the Astros to get off to a slow
start. Since 1980, the Astros have started at .500 or under 13
times. Eight of those teams ended with a winning record.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, the Astros opened 0-6. They rebounded to finish 85-77,
six games out of the lead in third place.
</P>
<P>
   During the club's NL West-winning 1986 season, the Astros were
14-6 after the first month despite two of their best hitters _
Glenn Davis (.227) and Jose Cruz (.121) _ struggling at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   After winning consecutive division titles the past two seasons,
lofty expectations have been placed on the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expectations are high in this clubhouse in the way we feel
about ourselves,'' Biggio said. ``I think they are also high in the
community and around the league. When you win the division the last
two years straight, everybody is shooting for you and everybody
wants to kick your butt. Everybody gets fired up to play us.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the price of winning. And while the wins have been slow in
coming, the Astros aren't ready to concede anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fine,'' closer Billy Wagner said. ``It's not a sprint
but a marathon.''

 &HT;    Ousted Hydron CEO wants to give company a face lift
 &HT;    By Marguerite M. Plunkett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ Hydron Technologies' board fired Harvey
Tauman. He's looking to return the favor.
</P>
<P>
   Tauman, the founder and former chief executive of the Boca
Raton-based skin care products company, and his wife now control
6.9 percent of Hydron's shares after their latest stock buy _
137,000 shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plan is to change the board,'' Tauman said Monday. ``Our
plan is to take over.''
</P>
<P>
   Countered Thomas Burns, Hydron's vice president of finance:
``Anybody's entitled to buy shares. If he accumulates more than 5
percent, he has a right to attempt to do whatever he wants to.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns deferred further comment to interim President Richard
Banakus, who was not available Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Tauman, known as ``Hydron Harvey'' when he pitched the company's
products on the QVC cable channel, said he and his wife, Jennifer
Canon Tauman, are ``going to make our move as soon as we can.'' But
he declined to provide additional details.
</P>
<P>
   Tauman pointed to Hydron's sagging sales as the reason he should
be returned to the top of the company that ``illegally and
wrongfully terminated'' him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've been watching the financial results, it's been
catastrophic,'' he said. ``It's gone straight down. Sales were half
from the year before.''
</P>
<P>
   Hydron, which employs 12 people, reported $4 million in sales
last year, down 45 percent from $7.3 million in 1997. The company
lost $1.9 million last year, an improvement over the $2.6 million
in red ink in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Hydron blamed the sales decrease on declining sales via QVC.
Tauman, when he was the company's CEO and president, said he once
used the shopping channel to move $2.7 million in Hydron products
in one day, including $1.2 million during one show.
</P>
<P>
   Hydron's board, including Tauman's son, Richard, fired him in
September 1997 after a disagreement over the company's direction.
Harvey Tauman sued the company a month later. Hydron countersued
and accused Tauman of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Tauman has since started a new line of skin care products under
the name Greyson International. As the ``Greyson Guy,'' he pitches
the stuff on QVC's cable rival, the Home Shopping Network.
</P>
<P>
   Tauman challenged the Hydron board Monday: ``Give the
shareholders a chance and don't waste any more company assets. To
fight us would be futile.''
</P>
<P>
   Hydron stock (Nasdaq: HTECC) closed down 19 cents Monday at
$1.06 a share.

<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ Skimming the headlines last month, more than
a few Rhode Islanders must have felt a tug of confusion. One day,
the big news was that ``Chafee'' would retire from the U.S. Senate.
The very next day, the story was that ``Chafee'' would run for the
seat.
</P>
<P>
   But the seeming contradiction was really the latest example of
the blood relativity of American politics, where yet another family
tree had taken root.
</P>
<P>
   John Chafee, 76, a Republican who had represented Rhode Island
in the Senate for more than two decades, was taking himself out of
the running in 2000, when his term ends. A son, Lincoln Chafee, 46,
the Republican mayor of Warwick, R.I., was putting himself into the
race.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in Warwick last Thursday, the younger Chafee
emphasized his experience leading the state's second-most-populous
city for the last six years, not his pedigree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Warwick is the best-run city in the state, and I'm
prepared to defend that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his surname helped make him an instant front-runner for
the Republican nomination, and it drew attention to the enduring
prominence of political progeny in a country whose next
presidential race could pit Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the son
and namesake of a former president, against Vice President Albert
Gore Jr., the son and namesake of a former U.S. senator.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the concern that Americans often profess when insiders
hold the reins of government, the sons, daughters, brothers,
sisters, nephews and nieces of prominent lawmakers continue to
thrive in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln Chafee, like several other second-generation politicians
interviewed for this article, said it was largely a matter of
exposure and rearing. Relatives of politicians, he said, were
simply more likely than others to enter the political arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's woven into our daily lives,'' he said, then drew an
analogy to the blood ties prominent in another profession. ``We're
always criticized for nepotism in the Fire Department here. But
it's natural. You see your Uncle Don running out to catch the
alarm, and it's contagious.''
</P>
<P>
   The children of politicians enjoy tactical advantages. John
Chafee demonstrated that as he and two aides hustled from his
office in Providence to a news conference in nearby Barrington last
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to the governor,'' the elder Chafee said, reporting
on a telephone conversation he had recently with Gov. Lincoln
Almond, a fellow Republican. ``He was very solicitous about Linc
and will help him. I asked him point blank.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in his office later that day, Chafee said his
contacts could play a large part in helping his son raise the $2.5
million estimated to be necessary for a successful Senate campaign
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it would be people who gave to me,'' Chafee said.
``They probably thought, `Oh, boy, we're spared,' when they read
that I was going to retire. But there's another Chafee running!''
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts and historians said dynasties have waxed and
waned. They said one reason for all the familiar surnames these
days could be the escalating price tag of running, a situation that
favors anyone with ready access to donors.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 elections not only returned George W. Bush to the
governor's office in Texas for a second term, but also installed
his brother, Jeb, in the governor's office in Florida for a first.
</P>
<P>
   In the Midwest, Bob Taft, the son and grandson of U.S. senators
and the great-grandson of a president, was elected governor of
Ohio, while Evan Bayh, the son of a U.S. senator, was elected to
the Indiana Senate seat that his father once held. In Texas, Rep.
Charlie Gonzalez, the son of Henry Gonzalez, succeeded his father.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in Colorado elected Mark Udall to the House; he is the
son of Morris Udall, who represented Arizona in the House for three
decades. Meanwhile, voters in New Mexico elected Mark's cousin Tom
Udall to the House; he is the son of Morris' brother Stewart Udall,
also a former Arizona congressman and Interior secretary in the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedys, of course, are the best example of dynasty, with
two family members now in Congress, Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,
and his son, Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I. And New England may be
the most fertile soil for the tradition.
</P>
<P>
   One of Connecticut's two senators, Christopher Dodd, a Democrat,
is the son of Thomas Dodd, who also represented Connecticut in the
Senate after losing his first bid for that office to Prescott Bush,
grandfather of the governors Bush. One of New Hampshire's two
representatives in the House, John Sununu Jr., a Republican,
inherited the name and interests of his father, a former New
Hampshire governor and presidential chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   But a blood line is no guarantee, and last fall's elections also
provided a compelling example of that. In the Minnesota governor's
race, the Democratic nominee, Hubert Humphrey III, son of a former
U.S. senator and vice president, lost to the ultimate outsider, a
former professional wrestler, Jesse Ventura.

   ``There's a continuing tension in American politics between
professionals and amateurs,'' noted Darrell West, a political
science professor at Brown University in Providence. ``People who
support term limits believe fervently in the citizen politician,
whereas others value political experience, which plays directly to
dynasties.''
</P>
<P>
   What plays just as directly to dynasties is the limited
attention of voters. It makes winning name recognition a tall
hurdle and favors any candidate with a well-known father or other
relative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half the voters are going to get confused and think it is the
dad running,'' said Christine Matthews, a Republican pollster. ``If
I were to do a poll in September of next year for Linc Chafee,
people would be saying, `Well, I think he's done a good job in the
Senate.'''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a number of pollsters have suggested that some of George
W. Bush's support comes from such confusion. But political progeny
arguably are propelled into office just as strongly by internal
factors.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez of Texas said he wanted to honor his father's career by
perpetuating it and that, unlike many people contemplating a run
for public office, he had not been daunted by the public scrutiny
or demands on his time that such a decision would bring.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've seen someone else handle it up close and personal, so
you know you can survive it,'' he said. ``It's not so foreign to
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln Chafee, one of six children, also grew up amid the
trappings of elective office. Before his father became senator in
1976, he was governor from 1963 to 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Stevens, one of Lincoln Chafee's boyhood friends,
recalled that Gov. Chafee ``would come in after a long day in
Providence, dealing with all these statewide issues, and say, `OK,
you're the governor of Rhode Island, this crisis is happening, what
do you do?'''
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln Chafee was not the most vociferous respondent, not the
one who would have seemed destined, alone among the Chafee
children, to end up in politics. He took a circuitous route,
choosing classics as his major at Brown and then working for the
better part of a decade as a farrier, shoeing race horses.
</P>
<P>
   His first election was to the Warwick City Council in 1986. In
1990, he tried and failed to become mayor, but won four subsequent
elections to two-year terms, even though there are many more
Democrats than Republicans among the city's roughly 85,000
residents.
</P>
<P>
   His father said the family name was indeed an asset, but only if
used the right way. He cited, as an example, the balance struck by
former Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum, a Kansas Republican, whose
campaign slogan had been ``a fresh face, a trusted name,'' the
latter phrase referring to her father, Alf Landon, a former
governor of Kansas and presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Chafee pushed the same slogan on Lincoln for one of his first
local races. The senator recalled that when he subsequently showed
his son's campaign literature to some of his colleagues and
friends, ``They said, `Oh, yeah, a trusted name. Lincoln.'''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZARETH, Israel _ In modern history, this sleepy Israeli Arab
town, the traditional childhood home of Jesus, has been a stranger
to the tensions roiling the Mideast. Christian and Muslim Arabs
lived together here in harmony. Together they depended on the
Christian pilgrims who sustained their feeble tourist economy, and
together they took pride in their sweets, exported as delicacies
throughout the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   Starting on Easter Sunday, however, the sleepy town awakened to
violent conflict. Stones, bricks and firebombs were thrown; the
town _ including the churches _ was effectively shuttered, and the
seemingly sturdy balance between Christians and Muslims was upset.
</P>
<P>
   Against the backdrop of the Christian-Muslim conflict in Kosovo,
it could seem a piddling controversy: a battle over a half-acre of
land, a few injuries and some broken windowpanes. But it threatens
to grow into an international diplomatic incident, pitting the
Muslim world against the Vatican _ with Israel, an interested
party, in the unlikely role of gendarme.
</P>
<P>
   This is the problem: In the heart of this scruffy town, on the
land in question, Mayor Ramez Jerayseh, who is Christian, plans to
build a plaza for the millennium next to the Basilica of the
Annunciation, an elegant modern building atop the ruined walls of a
12th-century Crusader church. It is a major Christian holy site,
the place where tradition says that the angel Gabriel told Mary she
was pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   The town's Muslim leadership, however, has other plans for the
land, which Muslims consider sacrosanct, too. Right next to the
church, they want to erect a twin symbol for their town _ a $20
million megamosque, to be financed by donors in the Persian Gulf
nations. It would be a multispired edifice topped by a soaring
325-foot-tall minaret with a laser crescent at its peak.
</P>
<P>
   Gazing at the site, Ahmed Zoubi, an engineer who helped design
the mosque and who is also a City Council member from the Islamic
Movement, stood between piles of nougat in the Center Sweets Shop
across the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is not to overshadow the church,'' he said calmly.
``We are willing to build a bridge connecting the mosque and the
church. The point is that Nazareth, which may be known to the world
as Christian, is a Muslim-majority city. It has two identities.''
</P>
<P>
   Anan Hayek emerged from a wedding at the church wearing a
pin-striped suit and soft leather loafers. A tourist bus driver who
is Christian, he sees the matter very differently, and in outrage
he shook a bag of the covered almonds that are used to shower the
bride and groom.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the city of Jesus,'' he said. ``They want to connect
our church to a mosque with a bridge! That is unthinkable. What is
happening here now is planting enmity in our hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also bad public relations for the tourism industry here.
It has high hopes for the year 2000, even if its development
projects are a bit behind schedule _ leading some officials to
declare that the year 2000 does not have to start in January for
everybody.
</P>
<P>
   In March 2000, Pope John Paul II is scheduled to visit, a
supremely important event for Nazareth. And Roman Catholic
authorities, who have expressed concern over the issue, are
cautioning the Israelis that a failure to resolve fairly the
delicate matter over the mosque could jeopardize their
participation in the millennial celebration in Israel, said Avi
Blushtein, the director general of the Israeli Ministry of
Religious Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Israelis and the Palestinians are trying to mediate the
conflict, although the Israelis, whose Land Authority owns the
property, are the official government authority here. But the
Israeli intervention is perceived as so manipulative _ the Likud
government is seen as wanting to end the conflict in a way that
will bring it Arab votes _ that it could be the catalyst to reunite
Nazareth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Israeli Arabs should be fighting them, not each other,''
said Mahmoud Nassar, a Muslim who owns the Peace Restaurant
downtown. But then he added, ominously, ``This city will burn if
the big mosque doesn't get built.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The conflict here underscores how varied and finely nuanced are
the internal divisions within Israel. Outsiders find it difficult
to understand the many ways in which Jews here are divided, much
less to fathom sectarian rifts among Israeli Arabs, who account for
one-sixth of the population.
</P>
<P>
   In Nazareth, Muslims outnumber Christians about 42,000 to
18,000, although the Christians _ both Roman Catholics and Greek
Orthodox _ tend to be more affluent and better educated. Through
the Communist Party, which they dominate, Christians have
controlled the town's affairs for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Three months ago, however, the Islamic Movement swept to a
majority in the City Council, even though Jerayseh held onto the
mayoralty. And the issue that carried the Islamic Movement to power
was the disputed half-acre.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen months ago, Jerayseh, with permission from the
government of Israel, had bulldozed the site. He cleared it of an
old school but left a tiny mosque that Muslims believe contains the
tomb of a holy figure from the 12th century.
</P>
<P>
   Outraged, Muslims erected a huge protest tent, a shabby
structure in the shadow of the basilica that Christian tourists
found repellent. Construction on the plaza never began, even as the
Nazareth 2000 project raced against the clock to renovate the city
for the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   The Christians and Muslims were in a static tug of war over the
land. The Israeli government left them alone, although in recent
weeks it stepped up its mediation efforts and seemed to back the
construction of the mosque, to the outrage of the Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few months, although there were outbursts of
violence, tension over the land did not permeate the general
population of the city, which is well integrated.
</P>
<P>
   But on Easter Sunday, the town erupted. It is hard to know what
really happened. The Muslims say Christian youths began throwing
rocks at the tiny mosque, chanting that Mohammed would fall just as
Jesus ascended. The Christians say that Islamic activists
surrounded an Easter procession and picked a fight.
</P>
<P>
   There were brawls, a dozen people were injured and a few dozen
cars were smashed as scores of police officers in riot gear
apparently chose not to intervene. In subsequent days, firebombs
were hurled at both Christian and Muslim businesses and homes.
</P>
<P>
   While thousands of Muslims crowded the tiny protest site for
Friday prayers, the church had taken the unusual step of closing
the basilica for two days. Christians shut themselves in their
homes; the mayor, who received death threats, was forced to
disconnect his phone.
</P>
<P>
   The basilica reopened Sunday for Mass, for tourists, and for
several local weddings. Cars outside were festooned with roses,
individual red ones taped to the windows. But the celebrations were
quieter than usual and anxiety-ridden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been locked inside our houses,'' Nadira Hayek said,
holding her little son's hand tightly after a wedding. ``When we go
outside, we've been hassled because we wear crosses around our
neck. Racism is coming to the surface here, and it is very sad.
We're afraid for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Zoubi, the council member, said the fear was unfounded. The
Muslims are willing to delay construction of the mosque until after
the millennium celebration is held, he said. Such is their spirit
of compromise, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact,'' he said, ``we are ready to invite the pope to lay
the cornerstone himself.''

CHASING A WAVE  
 VISITING BILBAO  
 THE TOP OF AUSTRALIA  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 18)

<P>
   Q. (italics)A group of friends would like to attend a surfing
camp for beginners this summer in Southern California or Hawaii.
Are there such camps? _ Jeff Rhodes, Cambridge, Mass.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. There has been a proliferation of surfing camps and schools,
especially in California, in recent years. In fact, the
International Surfing Association in La Jolla, Calif., (619)
551-5292, has set up a committee to monitor and set criteria for
such camps, according to Pierre Camoin, the association's
spokesman. The committee has just begun its work, though, and no
offical recommendations are available.
</P>
<P>
   But Camoin said prospective students should ask about
accommodations and safety _ in particular whether the staff is CPR
certified and whether lifeguards are always on duty.
</P>
<P>
   Among his personal recommendations was the granddaddy of them
all, the Paskowitz Surfing Camp, Post Office Box 522, San Clemente,
Calif. 92674. Started in 1972 by Dr. Dorian Paskowitz, it offers
five-day sessions from May 31 to Oct. 1, including seven
adults-only weeks. The $900 fee includes three meals a day, camping
in tents provided by the camp at San Mateo State Park, two lessons
a day and the use of boards and wet suits.
</P>
<P>
   Izzy Paskowitz, the director and one of the founder's sons, said
all the instructors are former or current professional surfers with
at least 10 years' experience. They have training in first aid and
CPR, he said. Eight instructors are assigned to a group of 15 to 20
students. And at age 79, Doc Paskowitz still demonstrates.
</P>
<P>
   Information: (949) 361-9283, fax (949) 361-9211,
members.aol.com/SURFCAMP/.
</P>
<P>
   One of the newer schools is Groundswell Surf Camp, Post Office
Box 5313, San Clemente, Calif. 92674, established three years ago
by Terry Senate. Senate said all his instructors are certified
lifeguards with CPR training.
</P>
<P>
   Classes are held at either Cardiff Reef or Silver Strand
beaches, near San Diego, and students camp in San Elijo State Park,
just off the beach. There is a large common tent with carpeting,
television and VCR.
</P>
<P>
   Sessions start every Monday from June 14 to Sept. 5 and cost
$650 for lodging, three meals a day, equipment and about two and a
half hours of instruction each morning. Adult-only sessions will
start June 14 and July 26. Phone and fax (949) 364-2262;
www.surfcamp.com.
</P>
<P>
   A possibility in Hawaii is the four-year-old Hans Hedemann Surf
School, 2947 Kalakaua Avenue No. 105, Honolulu, Hawaii 96815. It
offers two sites, at the Diamond Head Hotel near Honolulu and on
the North Shore at Pupukea. The fee of $150 a day includes four
hours of lessons, equipment, lodging at the hotel or in a
six-bedroom house in Pupukea that sleeps 10, and daily breakfast
($185 a day for three meals). Kayaking, snorkeling and biking are
offered.
</P>
<P>
   The school runs all year, said Howard Hart, the manager. All 15
instructors are certified lifeguards and most are professional
surfers; (808) 924-7778; www.hsurf.com.
</P>
<P>
   Other camps are listed on the Web at this address:
www.surfvideo.com/portal/instruc.htm. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)We plan to visit Spain, arriving and departing
Barcelona. Are there tours to the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao from
there? _ Elaine Skoler, Hyannis, Mass.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. It's not difficult to make a day trip to Bilbao by air from
Barcelona. An agency that can book such a trip for you is Tecnic
Viajes, 78 Gran Via de Hortaleza, 28043 Madrid, telephone (34-91)
388-1636, fax (34-91) 759-7879. It has a Barcelona office, but
bookings should be made through its Madrid office.
</P>
<P>
   Tecnic offers a day excursion of a flight to Bilbao (about an
hour) from either city in the morning, a bus or car tour of the
city, a tour of the Guggenheim with an English-speaking guide and a
return flight in the evening for about $190 a person in a group of
two to four (about $235 for a single), at the rate of 155 pesetas
to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   You could also book such a trip on your own. There are four
flights daily from Barcelona to Bilbao, most on Iberia, (800)
772-4642, with round-trip fares of about $190 to $240. (Figure on
frequent airport delays in Spain, which could slice an hour or two
from your time in Bilbao.)
</P>
<P>
   By train, the trip is about six and half hours ($83), so you'd
probably want to stay over. Information: (34-91) 328-9020. If you
drive, Barcelona is 385 miles from Bilbao. (Madrid is 245 miles
from Bilbao, so rail and air fares from there are a little less.)
</P>
<P>
   Admission to the Guggenheim _ which is open 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.
daily except Monday _ is about $5, and a 90-minute guided tour in
English would cost about $77 total for a group of 2 to 20. Tours
must be reserved at least two weeks in advance by contacting the
museum at (34-94) 435-9090, fax (34-94) 435-9039 (but call between
3 and 8 a.m. Eastern time to speak to someone in English). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)I would like to hike up Mount Kosciusko, Australia's
highest peak. Are there companies that can plan a trip there? _
Robert Yentel, Dix Hills, N.Y.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. At 7,310 feet, Mount Kosciusko, in New South Wales about 90
miles southwest of Canberra, is indeed the highest you can go Down
Under. But for those adventurers who try to climb the highest peak
on every continent, it is the least challenging _ you can even
drive a good ways up.
</P>
<P>
   Kosciusko National Park, in the Snowy Mountains, has become a
prime recreational and tourist area in the last couple of decades,
with its caves, glacial lakes, forests and ski resorts. In summer,
it is a fine place for bushwalks and wildfowers. From Charlotte
Pass, the peak is about a five-mile hike, though there are longer
trails, too.
</P>
<P>
   Two West Coast companies offer a seven-day hiking package from
Dec. 1 to March 31 (the Southern Hemisphere summer) with five days
of hiking in the area, including the fairly comfortable trek to the
peak. Accommodations are in alpine chalets in doubles or shared
rooms, and most meals and a guide are included.
</P>
<P>
   Australia-New Zealand Down Under Travel, 1328 El Camino Real,
Los Altos, Calif. 94022, (800) 886-2153, fax (650) 969-3215,
anztravel.com, said the package would be about $725, not including
air fare. At Down Under Answers, 12727 N.E. 20th Street, Bellevue,
Wash. 98005, (800) 788-6685, fax (425) 895-8929, www.adventour.com,
the estimate was $930. Mary Lou Serr, president of Down Under
Travel, suggested waiting till after the millennium for better air
fares.

 &HT;    Big Entertainment, CBS make `robust' promotion deal
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving to (f) Financial and (E) Entertainment categories.)
 &HT;    By Stephen Pounds
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ Shares in Big Entertainment more than doubled
Monday to $32.38 after the company announced a deal that gives CBS
35 percent ownership of the Boca Raton firm's Hollywood.com Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   To get its stake, CBS agreed to provide $100 million in
promotion for the Web site during the next seven years. CBS will
tout Hollywood.com on television, radio and syndicated programming.
</P>
<P>
   Big Entertainment will own 65 percent of the Hollywood.com
venture, which has one of the Web's largest collections of
movie-related multimedia offerings, plus movie listings and show
times as well as Hollywood news and celebrity interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Big Entertainment (Nasdaq: BIGE) closed up $16.63 a
share Monday, an increase of 105.56 percent.
</P>
<P>
   All this comes even though Big Entertainment has yet to complete
its $31 million stock deal with Los Angeles-based Times-Mirror Co.
to buy Hollywood Online, Times-Mirror's Hollywood.com subsidiary.
But Big E Chief Executive Officer Mitchell Rubenstein said the
company's major shareholders have pledged to support the deal,
making approval a certainty.
</P>
<P>
   For Big E, which has 97 employees in Boca Raton, the CBS deal
offers more than just promotion. CBS also intends to sell
advertising on Hollywood.com, which would benefit both companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a valuable addition to their ad sales. We give another
thing to sell,'' Rubenstein said. ``This is really robust.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal is structured in much the same way as CBS' agreements
with Sportsline USA, the Fort Lauderdale Web site that develops
sports content, and MarketWatch, a California-based Web site that
offers business and financial news. The two now are public
companies, and CBS' stake in them has grown to more than a
half-billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In both instances, CBS took an equity position in exchange for
promotion on its TV shows and radio stations. Then, when the
companies made initial stock offerings, CBS, without investing
cash, became a large shareholder in growing Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   In this instance, Rubenstein would have to spin off
Hollywood.com as a separate public company from its parent, Big E,
which already is a public company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying that that's what is going to happen, but
Sportsline and MarketWatch went public, and their value was created
through their public offerings,'' Rubenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Big E was founded by Rubenstein and his wife, Laurie Silvers,
founders of the Sci-Fi Channel, a cable channel that was sold in
1992 to USA Networks. They took Big E public in 1993, planning to
develop comic book characters that could be adapted to books,
movies and TV. That effort struggled, along with their next
strategy for Big E, to open entertainment-related retail kiosks.
</P>
<P>
   The company has had only two profitable quarters in about five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Big E's fortunes began to change in November, with the launch of
its bige.com Web site to sell entertainment and movie merchandise.
The site found a following, and some deft deals since have lifted
the company's position on the Internet as well as its stock price.
</P>
<P>
   In another deal Monday, CBS said it will get a 50 percent
ownership stake in storeRunner.com, a San Diego-based Web site that
scans Internet locations for good deals for shoppers. CBS will lend
its name to the site.

its $31 million stock deal with Los Angeles-based Times-Mirror Co.
to buy Hollywood Online, Times-Mirror's Hollywood.com subsidiary.
But Big E Chief Executive Officer Mitchell Rubenstein said the
company's major shareholders have pledged to support the deal,
making approval a certainty.
</P>
<P>
   For Big E, which has 97 employees in Boca Raton, the CBS deal
offers more than just promotion. CBS also intends to sell
advertising on Hollywood.com, which would benefit both companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a valuable addition to their ad sales. We give another
thing to sell,'' Rubenstein said. ``This is really robust.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal is structured in much the same way as CBS' agreements
with Sportsline USA, the Fort Lauderdale Web site that develops
sports content, and MarketWatch, a California-based Web site that
offers business and financial news. The two now are public
companies, and CBS' stake in them has grown to more than a
half-billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   In both instances, CBS took an equity position in exchange for
promotion on its TV shows and radio stations. Then, when the
companies made initial stock offerings, CBS, without investing
cash, became a large shareholder in growing Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   In this instance, Rubenstein would have to spin off
Hollywood.com as a separate public company from its parent, Big E,
which already is a public company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying that that's what is going to happen, but
Sportsline and MarketWatch went public, and their value was created
through their public offerings,'' Rubenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Big E was founded by Rubenstein and his wife, Laurie Silvers,
founders of the Sci-Fi Channel, a cable channel that was sold in
1992 to USA Networks. They took Big E public in 1993, planning to
develop comic book characters that could be adapted to books,
movies and TV. That effort struggled, along with their next
strategy for Big E, to open entertainment-related retail kiosks.
</P>
<P>
   The company has had only two profitable quarters in about five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Big E's fortunes began to change in November, with the launch of
its bige.com Web site to sell entertainment and movie merchandise.
The site found a following, and some deft deals since have lifted
the company's position on the Internet as well as its stock price.
</P>
<P>
   In another deal Monday, CBS said it will get a 50 percent
ownership stake in storeRunner.com, a San Diego-based Web site that
scans Internet locations for good deals for shoppers. CBS will lend
its name to the site.

EXCERPTS FROM JUDGE WRIGHT'S RULING
</HEADLINE>
  (With CLINTON-CONTEMPT) 
 (nk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Following are excerpts from the ruling Monday by federal
District Judge Susan Webber Wright in Little Rock, Ark., finding
President Clinton in contempt of court:
</P>
<P>
   What began as a civil lawsuit against the President of the
United States for alleged sexual harassment eventually resulted in
an impeachment trial of the President in the United States Senate
on two articles of impeachment for his actions during the course of
this lawsuit and a related criminal investigation being conducted
by the Office of the Independent Counsel (O.I.C.). The civil
lawsuit was settled while on appeal from this court's decision
granting summary judgment to defendants and the Senate acquitted
the President of both articles of impeachment. Those proceedings
having concluded, the court now addresses the issue of contempt on
the part of the President. ...
</P>
<P>
   For the reasons that follow, the court hereby adjudges the
President to be in contempt of court for his willful failure to
obey this court's discovery orders. ...
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 17, 1998, the President appeared before a grand jury in
Washington, D.C., as part of O.I.C.'s criminal investigation and
testified about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and his actions
during this civil lawsuit. That evening, the President discussed
the matter in a televised address to the nation. In his address,
the President stated that although his answers at his Jan. 17
deposition were ``legally accurate,'' he did not volunteer
information and that he did indeed have a relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky that was inappropriate and wrong. The President
acknowledged misleading people, in part because the questions posed
to him ``were being asked in a politically inspired lawsuit which
has since been dismissed,'' and because he ``had real and serious
concerns about an independent counsel investigation that began with
private business dealings 20 years ago. ...''
</P>
<P>
   It was during the President's televised address that the court
first learned the President may be in contempt. ...
</P>
<P>
   Following the acquittal of the President, this court held a
telephone conference on Feb. 16, 1999, to address the remaining
issues before this court, including the issue of attorney's fees
and the issue of whether the President should be subject to
contempt proceedings. The court explained to the parties that it
had previously declined to address the issue of the President's
contempt due to the fact that this case was on appeal at the time
and Congress was conducting impeachment proceedings against the
President.
</P>
<P>
   The court explained that had this court's grant of summary
judgment to defendants been reversed and the case remanded, there
would have been available certain sanctions that are unavailable
otherwise. The court further explained that even though this
litigation begat the controversy that was the subject of the
President's impeachment trial in the Senate, the interests
protected by the contempt authority of the court are significantly
different from the interests protected by the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, stated the court, the contempt authority protects
the integrity of a court's proceedings and provides a means of
enforcement of its orders, while impeachment is a constitutional
process in which the proper inquiry is the President's fitness to
serve in office. Given this distinction, the court determined that
it should defer to Congress and its constitutional duties prior to
this court addressing the President's conduct in this civil case.
</P>
<P>
   As the court explained to the parties, however, it is now time
to address the issue of the President's contempt as all other
proceedings that heretofore have precluded this court from
addressing the issue have concluded. Accordingly, it is that issue
to which the court now turns.
</P>
<P>
   The threshold question in this matter is whether a President of
the United States can be held in civil contempt of court and
thereby sanctioned. Although Federal courts possess the authority
to impose sanctions for civil contempt pursuant to the Federal
Rules of Civil Procedure and their inherent authority, no court has
ever held a President in contempt of court. Nevertheless, this
court has considered the matter and finds no constitutional barrier
to holding the President in civil contempt of court in this case
and imposing sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   This lawsuit involved private actions allegedly taken by the
President before his term of office began, and the contumacious
conduct on the part of the President was undertaken in his role as
a litigant in a civil case and did not relate to his duties as
President. Both the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit and the
Supreme Court held in this case that the Constitution does not
place the President's unofficial conduct beyond judicial scrutiny.
In so ruling, the Court of Appeals specifically rejected the
President's argument that ``because a Federal court will control
the litigation, the third branch necessarily will interfere with
the executive branch through the court's scheduling orders and its
powers to issue contempt citations and sanctions.'' (emphasis
added). Likewise, the Supreme Court explained that ``[it) is
settled law that the separation-of-powers doctrine does not bar
every exercise of jurisdiction over the President of the United
States.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Although not expressly addressed by the Supreme Court, a
necessary incident of the power to determine the legality of the
President's unofficial conduct includes the power to address
unofficial conduct which threatens the integrity of the proceedings
before the court. The sanctioning provisions in the Federal Rules
of Civil Procedure vest Federal courts with the power to address
conduct which threatens the integrity of the judicial process, and
the existence in the Federal courts of an inherent power
``necessary to the exercise of all others'' is likewise firmly
established and include[s) the ability to dismiss actions, assess
attorneys' fees, and to impose monetary or other sanctions
appropriate ``for conduct which abuses the judicial process.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the court recognizes that significant constitutional
issues would arise were this court to impose sanctions against the
President that impaired his decision making or otherwise impaired
him in the performance of his official duties. No such sanctions
will be imposed, however. Throughout the history of this case, this
court has attempted to apply the law to the President in the same
manner as it would apply the law to any other litigant, keeping in
mind the ``high respect that is owed to the office of the chief
executive.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, this court will not impose greater sanctions
against the President for his contumacious conduct in this case
than would be imposed against any other litigant and member of the
bar who engaged in similar misconduct. Moreover, this Court is
aware that it is obliged to use the least possible power adequate
to the end proposed in selecting contempt sanctions and will base
the imposition of sanctions on a principle of proportionality,
recognizing that the President's contumacious conduct occurred in a
case that was both dismissed on summary judgment as lacking in
merit and in which the plaintiff was made whole, having agreed to a
settlement in excess of that prayed for in her complaint.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, the Court finds that the power to determine the legality
of the President's unofficial conduct includes with it the power to
issue civil contempt citations and impose sanctions for his
unofficial conduct which abuses the judicial process. That
established, the Court now turns to the central issue of the
President's contempt. ...

 &HT;    Bush deals out lawsuit to stop Indian casinos
 &HT;    By Shirish Date
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Gov. Jeb Bush took his opposition to
gambling to court Monday, suing the federal government for writing
rules that could allow full-blown casinos on American Indian tribal
land in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Florida have really spoken, repeatedly, at the
ballot box,'' Bush said, referring to three statewide referendums
on casinos that have been rejected in the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Attorney General Bob Butterworth announced a joint
Florida-Alabama federal court lawsuit in response to the
long-expected publication of rules by the Department of Interior
that could let tribes operate slot machines, high-stakes card
tables and craps tables whether a state government approves or not.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, two tribes operate five casinos offering high-stakes
bingo, low-stakes poker and _ in the state's view: illegally _ slot
machines.
</P>
<P>
   The Miccosukee tribe operates a casino in Miami-Dade County.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminole tribe, which runs casinos in Hollywood, Tampa,
Immokalee and Glades County, has been trying for years to expand
its gambling operation, even accusing the state in a lawsuit of not
negotiating in good faith, as is required by a 1988 federal law.
</P>
<P>
   It was the result of that lawsuit _ a 1996 decision by the U.S.
Supreme Court saying tribes couldn't sue states _ that led the
Interior Department to draft a rule to resolve disputes between
states and tribes over gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Florida and other states objected, saying the Interior
Department has an inherent bias on the subject because it
administers tribal land.
</P>
<P>
   Department lawyers noted these objections in the Federal
Register on Monday, but essentially denied a conflict of interest
and said department Secretary Bruce Babbitt would consider
opposition from states when deciding whether and what sort of
gambling to allow.
</P>
<P>
   ``States will be invited to participate in mediation if they
wish,'' said the published explanation of the rules. ``They can
also submit comments on the proposed scope of gaming . . . and on
any other matter pertaining to an Indian tribe's proposed
procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not good enough, said Assistant Attorney General John
Glogau, Florida's lead lawyer on the issue. He said having a
back-door route to casinos usurps the authority of the state and
thwarts the will of the electorate, which in 1994 resoundingly
defeated a proposed constitutional amendment to allow casinos in
Florida. Similar efforts in 1978 and 1986 were defeated as well.
</P>
<P>
   The tribes, however, say the will of Florida voters is
irrelevant. ``Because the federal government is supreme in matters
regarding Indians,'' said Bruce Rogow, a Fort Lauderdale lawyer
representing the Seminole Tribe. ``The Seminoles should be allowed
casino gaming.''
</P>
<P>
   If full-blown casinos do come, they would come only to places
already owned by tribes prior to 1988, Glogau said. Attempts to
establish casinos on land acquired after 1988 would require
permission of the governor _ who Monday repeated his opposition to
gambling and its embedded ``something for nothing attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Glogau said he expects the whole question ultimately to go back
to the U.S. Supreme Court to decide once and for all. In the
meantime, casinos will not start appearing in Florida anytime soon,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Department built in comment and review periods of
several months in its new rule. Glogau said he believes Babbitt
will not move faster than the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've assured me they're not going to get out in front of us
on that,'' Glogau said.

 UNDATED: President's contempt. ...  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The record demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that
the President responded to plaintiff's questions by giving false,
misleading and evasive answers that were designed to obstruct the
judicial process. The President acknowledged as much in his public
admission that he ``misled people'' because, among other things,
the questions posed to him ``were being asked in a politically
inspired lawsuit, which has since been dismissed.'' Although there
are a number of aspects of the President's conduct in this case
that might be characterized as contemptuous, the court addresses at
this time only those matters which no reasonable person would
seriously dispute were in violation of this court's discovery
orders and which do not require a hearing, namely the President's
sworn statements concerning whether he and Ms. Lewinsky had ever
been alone together and whether he had ever engaged in sexual
relations with Ms. Lewinsky. ...
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to construe the President's sworn statements in
this civil lawsuit concerning his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky as
anything other than a willful refusal to obey this court's
discovery orders. Given the President's admission that he was
misleading with regard to the questions being posed to him and the
clarity with which his falsehoods are revealed by the record, there
is no need to engage in an extended analysis of the President's
sworn statements in this lawsuit. Simply put, the President's
deposition testimony regarding whether he had ever been alone with
Ms. Lewinsky was intentionally false, and his statements regarding
whether he had ever engaged in sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky
likewise were intentionally false, notwithstanding tortured
definitions and interpretations of the term ``sexual relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the President's aggravation with what he considered a
``politically inspired lawsuit'' may well have been justified,
although the court makes no findings in that regard. Even assuming
that to be so, however, his recourse for the filing of an improper
claim against him was to move for the imposition of sanctions
against plaintiff. The President could, for example, have moved for
sanctions pursuant to Federal Rule Civil Procedure 11 if, as he
intimated in his address to the Nation, he was convinced that
plaintiffs lawsuit was presented for an improper purpose and
included claims ``based on `allegations and other factual
contentions [lacking) evidentiary support' or unlikely to prove
well-grounded after reasonable investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The President never challenged the legitimacy of plaintiff's
lawsuit by filing a motion pursuant to Rule 11, however, and it
simply is not acceptable to employ deceptions and falsehoods in an
attempt to obstruct the judicial process, understandable as his
aggravation with plaintiffs lawsuit may have been. ``A lawsuit is
not a contest in concealment, and the discovery process was
established so that `either party may compel the other to disgorge
whatever facts he has in his possession.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In sum, the record leaves no doubt that the President violated
this court's discovery orders regarding disclosure of information
deemed by this court to be relevant to plaintiffs lawsuit. The
court therefore adjudges the President to be in civil contempt of
court pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(b)(2). ...
</P>
<P>
   The court will convene a hearing at the request of the President
should he desire an opportunity in which to demonstrate why he is
not in civil contempt of court, why sanctions should not be
imposed, or why the court is otherwise in error in proceeding in
the manner in which it has. In that regard, the court will stay
enforcement of this memorandum opinion and order for 30 days from
the date of its entry in which to give the President an opportunity
to request a hearing or file a notice of appeal. In addition, the
court will entertain any legitimate and reasonable requests from
the President for extensions of time in which to address the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Should the President fail to request a hearing or file a notice
of appeal within the time allowed, the court will enter an order
setting forth the time and manner by which the President is to
comply with the sanctions herein imposed. Should the President
succeed in obtaining a hearing, however, whether at his request or
by way of appeal, any interests in an expeditious resolution of
this matter and in sparing the President and this court the turmoil
of evidentiary hearings will no longer be a consideration.
Accordingly, the President is hereby put on notice that this court
will take evidence at any future hearings _ including, if
necessary, testimony from witnesses _ on all matters concerning the
President's conduct in this lawsuit which may warrant a finding of
civil contempt.
</P>
<P>
   The court takes no pleasure whatsoever in holding this nation's
President in contempt of court and is acutely aware, as was the
Supreme Court, that the President ``occupies a unique office with
powers and responsibilities so vast and important that the public
interest demands that he devote his undivided time and attention to
his public duties.''
</P>
<P>
   As noted earlier, however, this court has attempted throughout
this case to apply the law to the President in the same manner as
it would apply the law to any other litigant, keeping in mind the
duties and status of the Presidency and the ``high respect'' that
is to be accorded his office.
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, there simply is no escaping the fact that the
President deliberately violated this court's discovery orders and
thereby undermined the integrity of the judicial system. Sanctions
must be imposed, not only to redress the President's misconduct,
but to deter others who might themselves consider emulating the
President of the United States by engaging in misconduct that
undermines the integrity of the judicial system. Accordingly, the
court adjudges the President to be in civil contempt of court
pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37(b)(2) for his
willful failure to obey this court's discovery orders and hereby
orders the following:
</P>
<P>
   I. The President shall pay plaintiff any reasonable expenses,
including attorney's fees, caused by his willful failure to obey
this court's discovery orders. Plaintiffs former counsel are
directed to submit to this court a detailed statement of any
expenses and attorney's fees incurred in connection with this
matter within 20 days of the date of entry of this memorandum
opinion and order.
</P>
<P>
   2. The President shall deposit into the registry of this court
the sum of $1,202.00, the total expenses incurred by this court in
traveling to Washington, D.C. at the President's request to preside
over his Jan. 17 deposition.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Court will refer this matter to the Arkansas
Supreme Court's Committee on Professional Conduct for review and
any action it deems appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   The court will stay enforcement of this memorandum opinion and
order for 30 days from the date of its entry in order to allow the
President an opportunity to request a hearing or file a notice of
appeal. Should the President fail to timely request a hearing or
file a notice of appeal, the court will enter an order setting
forth the time and manner by which the President is to comply with
the sanctions herein imposed.

GOVERNMENT SAYS HMOS MISLEAD MEDICARE RECIPIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ind., Ohio)   (af)  
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Health maintenance organizations routinely
distribute inaccurate information on benefits and costs to Medicare
beneficiaries, and the government frequently approves such
misleading documents, federal investigators said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress,
said it had examined documents from 16 HMOs and found ``significant
errors and omissions'' in materials from all of them.
</P>
<P>
   Such documents, it said, are often the members' ``only source of
detailed information'' about health benefits and coverage, but they
are frequently ``not accurate, timely or complete.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate report, the GAO said HMOs often failed to inform
Medicare beneficiaries that they could appeal decisions to deny
care or payment for services. As a result, it said, many patients
``may be unnecessarily exposed to substantial health care costs.''
When an HMO refuses to pay for services, like nursing home care, it
is supposed to inform patients that they can challenge the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Special Committee on Aging will investigate these
problems at a hearing on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs cover 7 million people who are elderly or disabled _ 18
percent of the 39 million Medicare beneficiaries. The number of
beneficiaries in such managed care plans has nearly doubled in the
last three years. Total Medicare spending is expected to reach $216
billion this year, with HMOs expected to get $37 billion, or 17
percent, of that amount.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services agreed
with the report's conclusion that they should scrutinize HMO
marketing materials more closely.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO found that some Medicare HMOs provided benefits less
generous than what they had agreed to in their contracts with the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare officials review and approve all booklets, brochures
and marketing materials sent to Medicare beneficiaries by HMOs. But
errors often slip through because Medicare officials do not have
detailed standards to evaluate the format, terminology and content
of brochures, the accounting office said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said they were trying to
develop such standards.
</P>
<P>
   Even when federal officials find errors in HMO literature and
marketing materials, they do not follow up to make sure the
mistakes are corrected, the auditors said.
</P>
<P>
   The report said some HMOs told women that they needed a referral
from a doctor to get a mammogram, even though federal rules
explicitly prohibit such a requirement.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the accounting office found that some HMOs
misrepresented the prescription drug coverage they were supposed to
provide to Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it said, one big HMO told members that it would
cover $600 a year in prescription drug costs, even though the
company's contract with the government required at least $1,200 a
year in coverage, and Medicare was paying for the more extensive
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Karen M. Ignagni, president of the American Association of
Health Plans, which represents HMOs, vowed to take ``a very serious
look'' at the report. ``We have an obligation to provide Medicare
beneficiaries with accurate information in an understandable
form,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO said that one HMO continued to advertise and enroll new
customers in some Ohio counties throughout 1998, without telling
them that it intended to end its Medicare services in those
counties on Jan. 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting office did not name the health plan, but details
in the report suggested that it was Anthem Inc. of Indianapolis.
Lauren Green-Caldwell, a spokeswoman for Anthem, said federal rules
required it to continue selling its Medicare HMO until the end of
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO said that no one document fully describes the services
covered by a Medicare HMO. Typically, it said, patients must
examine four or five documents to answer basic questions, and the
documents sometimes contradict one another.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Medicare beneficiaries have been allowed to quit an
HMO on a month's notice. But in 2002, they will lose this privilege
and will be able to change their decisions only once each year
outside Medicare's annual open enrollment period.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, the GAO said, it is essential that HMOs provide
more accurate information about the scope of coverage,
beneficiaries' rights, copayments and other costs.

   WASHINGTON _ George Allen, a Republican known for his
congeniality and conservatism when he was governor of Virginia, is
expected to announce on Tuesday that he will run for the Senate
next year, challenging the two-term incumbent Democrat, Charles
Robb.
</P>
<P>
   Highly popular in the state from his years in the Virginia
Legislature, Allen became governor in 1993, winning 58 percent of
the vote. After his single four-year term, which is all Virginia
law allows for governors, he returned to private practice as a
lawyer and began planning for a Senate campaign by raising money
and speaking across the state.
</P>
<P>
   Terri Hauser, a campaign spokeswoman, said she did not want to
pre-empt Allen's announcement plans but added, ``He's been testing
the waters, and they're feeling mighty fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Allen indicated that he would run for the Senate,
forming an exploratory committee in December, Robb was viewed by
many political analysts as one of the most vulnerable of the 14
Democratic senators seeking re-election next year.
</P>
<P>
   While Republicans were winning control of Congress in 1994,
Virginia voters found Robb's admitted marital infidelities only
slightly less objectionable than the role his opponent, Oliver
North, the former Marine lieutenant colonel, played in the
Iran-contra affair.
</P>
<P>
   But Allen, 47, has no such baggage, and already statewide polls
have shown that he would defeat Robb, 59, by a comfortable margin.
Neither candidate is expected to face a major challenge before the
general election.
</P>
<P>
   ``He enters this race as an incumbent underdog,'' Robert
Holsworth, a professor of political science at Virginia
Commonwealth University, in Richmond, said of Robb. ``I think the
race is likely to be close, but the early polls show Allen beating
him in a head-to-head race.''
</P>
<P>
   As governor, Allen left a firm legacy, reflecting Republican
ideals that are popular among many Republican governors. He pushed
through one of the country's toughest welfare-to-work programs, and
he led an effort to eliminate parole for violent offenders.
</P>
<P>
   He also worked to establish standards of learning in Virginia's
public schools, setting them so high that only 2 percent of the
state schools passed them last year when they were measured for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   Allen would also seem to benefit from a state Republican Party
that is more unified now than it was six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   North won the party nomination after a bruising fight with James
Miller, a former budget director in the Reagan administration. Then
he failed to win the endorsement of the state's most popular
Republican, Sen. John Warner, or his commander in chief, President
Ronald Reagan, a setback that effectively split the party through
the fall campaign season.
</P>
<P>
   With Warner backing Marshall Coleman, a
Republican-turned-independent, Robb won in the general election
with 46 percent of the vote to 43 percent for North and 11 percent
for Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   State Democratic officials say they expect Robb to attack Allen
as a conservative who is out of step with most Virginia voters.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Craig Bieber, chairman of the state Democratic Party, says that
though Allen ``cultivates a moderate facade, he is really as
right-wing as North was.''
</P>
<P>
   Bieber also said Allen could prove vulnerable for taking credit
for state economic expansion that would have occurred anyway and
for policies that have made Virginia a leading importer of
prisoners and garbage from other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Robb will run on the fact he is a moderate voice of
reason in the United States Senate,'' Bieber said. ``It will be up
to us to point out that Allen is as extreme as Ollie North was.''

MUSIC AND LIFE IN HARMONY IN PBS' `GREAT COMPOSERS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time and channel.)  
 By JOSHUA KOSMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Television may not be the ideal vehicle for teaching people
about classical music, but in the right hands it can pack a
tremendous amount of material into a compact stretch of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great Composers,'' a splendid three-week, six-part series
co-produced by BBC and New York's WNET-TV that begins airing
Wednesday, offers thoughtful, fascinating introductions to the
lives and works of six titans of Western music, and does it with
both visual flair and seriousness of purpose. This is an
entertaining, educational feast not to be missed.
</P>
<P>
   This week's two hourlong episodes, on Mozart and Beethoven, are
by far the strongest, but there is plenty to savor in the coming
weeks _ segments on Wagner and Mahler are slated for April 21,
followed on April 28 by Tchaikovsky and Puccini.
</P>
<P>
   The first sign that the series has been done right is the list
of participants, a starry A-list drawn from the worlds of
performance and scholarship. Many of the artists _ including
Michael Tilson Thomas on Beethoven and Mahler, or Sir Colin Davis
on Mozart, or Sir Charles Mackerras on Puccini _ have cogent and
fascinating things to say, and even the less articulate musicians,
such as tenor Jose Cura or pianist Evgeny Kissin, are welcome
additions.
</P>
<P>
   The academic side is equally well represented, with some of the
most eminent and knowledgeable scholars brought in for each
composer. William Meredith, who heads the Beethoven Center at San
Jose State University, is just one among many big guns.
</P>
<P>
   Using a combination of location shots, talking heads and
performance footage, each episode traces the life story of its
subject, interpolated with wonderfully specific explanations of his
importance to music history. The result, at its best, is an
amazingly deft blend of biography and musicology.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt that's what any such project should aspire to, but in
practice the balance is devilishly hard to pull off. Too often, the
life and the music are kept separate, with the former falling prey
to romantic mythologizing and the latter to oversimplification.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great Composers'' doesn't entirely avoid these pitfalls, but
it does keep them at bay with remarkable thoroughness. The Mozart
segment, for instance, takes an unsentimental view of the
composer's popular success and subsequent decline, and relates it
with a few swift strokes to the cultural politics of imperial
Vienna. Salieri's name, thank God, is never mentioned, despite the
presence of ``Amadeus'' playwright Peter Shaffer.
</P>
<P>
   Beethoven and Mahler, too, are treated with the sympathy due
their respective plights, without lapsing into the grandiose hero
worship with which each man tended to view himself. Most enjoyable
is the Puccini segment, for which the producers have rounded up
some of the composer's long-ago neighbors, now garrulous old women
who are only too happy to spill the beans about his marital
peccadilloes.
</P>
<P>
   Even more rewarding, though, is the high level of musical
discussion to be found in most of these segments. Certainly, there
are the usual empty superlatives _ most of them from performers _
about how this one's music is extraordinary and that one's music is
unlike anything ever composed.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also plenty of concrete observations, backed up
with musical examples _ about the effect of Mozart's first
encounter with the music of Bach, or the nature of Beethoven's
early keyboard style, or Puccini's relationship to the Italian
opera tradition from which he grew.
</P>
<P>
   The exception is Tchaikovsky, about whom there is apparently
nothing of substance to be said. The producers deal skillfully with
the historical controversy surrounding his death _ was it cholera
or (as some implausibly claim) suicide? _ but other than that,
there is only vaporous yammering about how his music touches the
heart. Not even his life story is told with anything approaching
coherence.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to whine, as some commentators have already begun to
do, about all that's been left out in these sketches _ about the
rapid forced march through each life or the brevity of the musical
excerpts, not to mention the inevitable fact that six composers
were selected and countless more omitted.
</P>
<P>
   But we're dealing, after all, with one-hour television segments
that attempt to encapsulate some of Western music's most stunning
achievements. What's striking is not how much is left out but how
much the creators have managed to pack in.

   ON-LINE AUCTIONS TURNING MILLIONS INTO BIDDERS
</P>
<P>
   Millions of people have begun embracing the on-line auction, an
Internet phenomenon that in a matter of months has captivated the
nation's bargain hunters and spawned a market for nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   While retailers spend furiously to draw more customers on line,
the Internet is suddenly teeming with buyers and sellers making
their own markets. Testimonials about bargains abound in the chat
rooms where the auction aficionados gather, and some will admit
that the thrill of the game is worth it even when they lose or
overpay.
</P>
<P>
   GOLDMAN RAISES PRICE OF OFFERING
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, Sachs, Wall Street's last large, privately held
investment bank, said that it would raise the price range of its
highly anticipated initial public offering to $45 to $55 a share,
up from a range of $40 to $50. And that promises to create some fat
wallets on Wall Street. For example, the firm's co-chairman and
chief executive, Henry M. Paulson Jr., who owns the largest
individual stake in Goldman, would see his shares valued at about
$227 million.
</P>
<P>
   TYCO TO ELIMINATE 4,000 AMP JOBS
</P>
<P>
   Tyco International, the top maker of electrical connectors since
its purchase a week ago of AMP, said that it would cut 4,000 AMP
jobs and that it expected profit to rise by 25 percent in five to
six years. The reductions are on top of 4,200 already planned by
AMP.
</P>
<P>
   SAVINGS ASSOCIATIONS' SHARES FALL
</P>
<P>
   Golden State Bancorp shares fell, as did other securities tied
to lawsuits by savings and loan associations against the
government. On Friday, a judge awarded Golden State less than
investors had expected, although he agreed the Government had
broken a promise of special regulatory treatment.
</P>
<P>
   FORD TO BUY CAR-REPAIR CHAIN
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor agreed to buy the European car-repair chain Kwik-Fit
Holdings for $1.63 billion in cash. Analysts said the move would
allow Ford to compete with independent repair shops and to sell
more Ford parts.
</P>
<P>
   IBM AND REAL NETWORKS IN DEAL
</P>
<P>
   IBM said that it had enlisted Real Networks, the online
multimedia company, to help its effort to create a standard for
sending music over the Internet. The cooperation between the
computer industry giant and the Internet start-up is the latest
development in the race to market a consumer-friendly way of
distributing music on line while guarding against piracy. Shares of
Real Networks rose $39.50, to $247.
</P>
<P>
   CHINESE EXPORTS FELL IN QUARTER
</P>
<P>
   China's exports fell 7.9 percent in the first quarter, as sharp
declines in shipments to Europe more than offset increased exports
to the United States. The report was worrisome because economists
fear that China's economy, the largest in Asia after Japan's, may
stumble, as did other Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
   ADELPHIA EXPANDING IN CABLE
</P>
<P>
   Adelphia Communications, moving to become the fourth-largest
cable-television company, agreed to buy Harron Communications'
cable systems for $1.17 billion in cash to expand in New England
and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   PROFITS UP AT NEWSPAPER COMPANIES
</P>
<P>
   Gannett and two other newspaper publishers, Dow Jones and E.W.
Scripps, reaped better-than-expected quarterly profits as
advertising revenue grew and newsprint prices fell.

METS RIDE RISING TIDE OF GOOD PITCHING AND DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Not even a flood in his office could dampen Mets
Manager Bobby Valentine's mood Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Not after Bobby Jones hit his first career home run to break a
1-1 tie in the Mets' home opener, all while tossing seven dominant
innings to resemble the Bobby Jones who was named a National League
All-Star two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And certainly not while Robin Ventura did his best Brooks
Robinson imitation at third base while breaking open the game with
a two-run double in a very auspicious Shea Stadium debut, as the
Mets pulled away for an 8-1 victory over the Florida Marlins before
an announced sellout crowd of 52,052.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, it seems _ not even sewage from a pump failure _ can
sink Valentine's hopes for this season right now. Not as long as
the Mets, who have won four straight games and six of eight to open
the season, keep rolling through the early part of their schedule
the way they did again Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was a very, very good day,'' Valentine said in full
uniform in the Jets' old dressing room a full half-hour after the
game. It wasn't that Valentine did not want to take a shower, it
was that he and his players and coaches could not, because of the
flood waters swirling around part of the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll get all of that cleaned up,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   All last week, while the Mets were on the road, Valentine kept
speaking of how much he looked forward to going home so he could
see his team's revamped clubhouse. Imagine Valentine's surprise
then when he walked into his office late Sunday night and was
greeted by a desk as big as an ocean liner.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the concern that Valentine must have felt
when he raced into the clubhouse to grab a cup of coffee in the
sixth inning Monday only to find his office _ including that same
desk and boxes of his prized collection of World Series programs _
just beginning to submerge into a rising tide of waste water. The
problem, the Mets said, was a pump failure that flooded Valentine's
office, the showers and the coaches' room.
</P>
<P>
   After a weekend in which his team lost its most productive
hitter, Mike Piazza, and one of its most reliable starting
pitchers, Rick Reed, to injuries, Valentine could have been
forgiven if he felt as if he were trapped in some sort of disaster
movie.
</P>
<P>
   But after the Mets had dismantled the low-budget Marlins for the
third time in a week since an embarrassing opening day loss in
Miami, Valentine and his players chose to laugh the whole mess off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like Little League,'' said Bobby Bonilla, who
went 3 for 3 with two runs scored and his first run batted in of
the season after opening the year 1 for 17 on the road. ``You play
the game and shower at home.''
</P>
<P>
   But first, Ventura had to find his way to his new home, near
Bonilla's in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt real strange,'' said Ventura, who spent his first 10
seasons in the major leagues with the Chicago White Sox before
signing a four-year, $32 million deal in the off season with the
Mets. ``Even when we flew in yesterday, it was just different. Not
knowing how to get here, where to park, where the clubhouse is, my
locker, the field.''
</P>
<P>
   But from the very first pitch Monday, Ventura looked as if he
felt at home. The five-time American League Gold Glove winner
robbed the fleet Luis Castillo of a bunt single up the third-base
line with a magnificent charge, barehand grab and throw in the
first inning. Ventura pulled off almost the same combination on
Castillo _ Valentine said it was harder because Castillo's bunt was
perfect _ in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bunted two times, give me one _ one for him, one for me,''
said Castillo, who seemed in awe. ``He's the best third baseman in
the National League.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, however, Ventura insisted he was not flashy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not flashy,'' Valentine said. ``He's just good. Brooks
Robinson wasn't flashy either.''
</P>
<P>
   To torment the Marlins' second baseman even further, Ventura
reached into the stands to grab a Castillo foul pop in the eighth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura also broke up a double play in the second inning that
resulted in a wild relay to first and the first run of the game.
After the Marlins tied the score, Jones gave himself the lead back
with a solo shot off Livan Hernandez in the bottom of the fifth
that landed just inside the left-field foul pole.
</P>
<P>
   What the Mets really need from Jones is for him to be more
consistent on the mound. ``I've always had my good games and my bad
games,'' Jones said after allowing one run on four hits. Still,
Monday was the 29-year-old right-hander's second strong
seven-inning performance in a row against the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take those two starts any time,'' said Jones, who had
tossed seven shutout innings in a 6-0 victory in Miami five days
before. ``It's as close to as good as I could have done.''

HARROWING IMAGES OF JUNKIES IN HBO'S `BLACK TAR' 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEVA CHONIN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ While her toddler plays in another room,
Michelle has a friend inject heroin into a vein in her neck _ one
of the few that's still functioning after years of needles and
impure dope.
</P>
<P>
   Later, she admits that her little son suggested she try
methadone instead. ``I've just realized that he knows more than I
thought he did,'' Michelle says miserably.
</P>
<P>
   This is just one among many disturbing moments in Steven
Okazaki's ``Black Tar Heroin: The Dark End of the Street.'' The
television documentary, which premieres Wednesday as part of HBO's
``America Undercover'' series, follows the lives of five bruised
and ailing San Francisco junkies ages 18 to 25 as they alternately
try to support their habits and kick them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arguably, right now San Francisco is the heroin capital of the
nation,'' says Okazaki, 47. ``It has the highest hospital
admissions for heroin-related problems, and it's up there with New
Jersey in overdose deaths _ about 100 a year. In January alone,
when Boz Scaggs' son Oscar died, there were about 15.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oscar-winning director, who lives in Berkeley, Calif., found
his subjects by volunteering at a youth-oriented needle exchange
off Polk Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to win their respect,'' he says. ``A lot of them had
contacts with media where somebody comes in for a Thanksgiving Day
story to show how miserable people in the street are. I've heard
firsthand stories about film crews offering the kids 40 bucks to
shoot up in front of the camera.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot of shooting up in ``Black Tar,'' but the footage
is far too harrowing for a human-interest holiday special. Alice, a
Seattle transplant, spatters the walls of her hotel room with blood
from syringes; Jake, an HIV-positive addict with a blood infection,
sneaks out of the hospital to inject heroin into his IV tube.
</P>
<P>
   Okazaki acknowledges that following his protagonists through
their daily lives was difficult. ``The streets are much more
dangerous when you're stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Using digital video equipment small enough to be concealed under
a jacket, he and sound engineer Jason Cohen gained access to hotel
rooms, toilets and shooting galleries where a regular camera would
have been barred.
</P>
<P>
   A soundtrack that includes Bay Area bands Ovarian Trolley and
the Mr. T Experience provides a ragged musical backdrop as Okazaki
captures heroin culture in graphic close-ups of ruined veins and
open sores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black tar destroys veins at a much faster pace than powder, so
finding a vein is more of an issue for people who have been doing
it for a couple of years,'' Okazaki says. ``They amputated a couple
of Jake's fingers; they said they might have to amputate his hand.
Black tar is to white powder heroin what crack is to white powder
cocaine. It's quickly and cheaply refined; it's impure but really
potent.''
</P>
<P>
   After three years of following five young people in and out of
San Francisco's judicial system, the director says he's frustrated
by its lack of counseling and rehab programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The addict population has gotten much younger: The average age
10 years ago was 27; now it's 19 to 20,'' he says. ``It's
ridiculous to jail these kids and then just kick them back out on
the streets. It's so hard to kick heroin, and almost everybody gets
busted fairly regularly and has to (go through withdrawal) in jail.
It's such a prime opportunity. But the prison system just says,
`Oh, screw 'em.' The mayor and the city government people should be
ashamed. They're part of the problem.''

Multitalented family to play visible roles as Boston starts NFL
career
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN McCLAIN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NFL historians can look long and hard and never find a football
family as unique as the Bostons.
</P>
<P>
   David Boston left Humble for Ohio State, where he became one of
the best receivers in the country. On Saturday, an NFL team will
draft him in the top half of the first round and eventually make
him a multimillionaire.
</P>
<P>
   If Boston has a problem with his agent during contract
negotiations, he can call his mother to complain. Why? Because his
sister, Dallas attorney Alicia Boston, is the agent who is
representing her younger brother.
</P>
<P>
   If Alicia Boston has a problem with her client, she may be the
only agent in the country who can punch him and not get fired.
</P>
<P>
   Even if she gets him one of the best contracts in history, the
Bostons won't be popping a bottle of champagne to celebrate. David
is only 20, which means he's too young to drink and has to get his
mother or father to co-sign his contract to make it legal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carolyn and I advised David to stay in school for his senior
year for two reasons,'' says Byron Boston, the patriarch of the
family. ``We felt he was too young to come out early, and if he
stayed another year, he'd be closer to getting his degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we've always told David to follow his heart, and this is
what he wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Byron Boston, a tax consultant, is an NFL line judge who has a
chance to make history in the preseason. Jerry Seeman, the league's
senior director of officiating, is thinking about assigning Boston
to one of his son's preseason games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something we'd ever do in regular season, but we
might in preseason because it's something that's never occurred,''
Seeman says.
</P>
<P>
   Once the league sees which team Boston will play for, they will
give him and his father a chance to make history in preseason.
Before that game, they will be in the national spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't usually put much emphasis on that kind of thing, but
I'd like to have a couple of pictures of it because it would be
unique,'' Byron Boston says.
</P>
<P>
   Byron has played a major role in his son's development into a
high No. 1 draft choice. At Humble High School, Boston was an
outstanding football and basketball player. In football, he was
actually a better defensive back than receiver.
</P>
<P>
   When he made the decision to attend Ohio State, he elected to
give up basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once David made that decision and turned that page of his
career, that's when he really began to develop,'' Byron says.
``He's always had a great work ethic, and we've always thought he
would be successful no matter what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Alicia Boston is an attorney in the Dallas firm of Worsham,
Forsythe and Wooldridge. She doesn't plan to be an agent, but when
her brother told her he'd like to keep it all in the family, she
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My firm's been great about it,'' she says. ``They're excited
about it, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to get David the best deal possible. He's a
talented player who's smart and has good character. He deserves to
be paid what he's worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Alicia Boston has been doing her homework. The NFL Players
Association has been providing help and information. She has hired
two experienced agents as consultants, but she is the only one who
will negotiate the contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure David's heard something like, `Your sister's going to
mess up your deal,' but he hasn't told me about it,'' she says.
``He knows I have his best interests at heart. One advantage of
being brother and sister is that I can be brutally honest with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not nervous about it. I'm very excited, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Boston signs his first contract, he plans to start a
corporation. He already knows who will be his CEO _ his mother. If
he decides to pay big bucks for a director of security, he can hire
his older brother, Byron Boston Jr., a policeman in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family means so much to me,'' Boston says. ``I know they'll
always have my best interests at heart. I wouldn't be in this
position without my family. I wanted to keep as much as I could in
the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alicia's a lawyer, and she's smart. I started to seriously
consider her (to negotiate the contract) in the middle of last
season when I began to think about coming out early. That was a
very difficult decision, especially since my parents wanted me to
stay in school, but I'm comfortable with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston was an extraordinary athlete growing up in Humble.
Success came naturally to him at an early age, but his parents
provided him with an outstanding work ethic that helped him star as
a freshman at Ohio State and made him one of the best NFL prospects
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a kid, I was catching passes all the time,'' Boston
says. ``I didn't want to be the quarterback. I just wanted to catch
the ball. I always liked to run deep routes. My dad could throw it
deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad has been a big influence on my life and my football
career. He taught me how to handle different situations, how to
deal with people. I'm very protective of myself, and I don't let
people take advantage of me.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom did everything for me when I was growing up. She cooked
three meals, ironed my clothes. She taught me how to act. She just
made my life a lot easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston has been paying a lot of attention to his father, who
sees NFL players up close and personal every Sunday during the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's talked to me about how fast and physical the NFL is,''
Boston says. ``I don't know where I'll go, but I think I bring
size, speed, strength and determination to the NFL. I have no fear.
A lot of people think I'm cocky, but I think I'm just a tough
competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about the draft, but I'm getting a little
impatient. I'm anxious to find out where I'm going to be playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Boston has more sympathy for officials than most
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, guys don't think about what referees go through, how fast
things happen, and it doesn't matter what sport it is,'' Boston
says. ``Things happen in an instant. Sometimes, they can't see
everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they miss one, it's going to be all over television, but if
they get 5,000 right, no one says anything. There's a lot of
pressure on them. They can't go to Las Vegas, can't be around any
gambling. They have to stay squeaky clean.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless a good team trades up in the first round to get him,
there's a chance David will watch his father reach the Super Bowl
before he does.
</P>
<P>
   A former Southwest Conference official, Byron Boston has been in
the NFL for four years. He already has officiated in conference
championship games the last two years. There's only one more step
to go, and Seeman says Boston is already one of the league's better
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, if I get drafted high, that means I'm probably going to
a team that didn't do too well last season,'' David Boston says.
``That means my dad will probably get to a Super Bowl before I do.
But you know what? I'll be real happy for him.''

GOLDMAN RAISES PRICE RANGE FOR ITS STOCK OFFERING 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., taking advantage of financial
markets that have rebounded from last fall's doldrums, said Monday
that it would raise the price range of its highly anticipated
initial public offering by as much as 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And that promises to create some very fat wallets on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Documents filed Monday with the Securities and Exchange
Commission as part of the revised offering provide a glimpse of the
riches that would be harvested by Goldman's partners if the shares
sold at the high end of the expected range.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's co-chairman and chief executive, Henry M. Paulson
Jr., who owns the largest individual stake in Goldman, would see
his 4.132 million shares valued at about $227 million. Two men
considered to be vying to succeed Paulson one day, the co-chief
operating officers John A. Thain and John L. Thornton, would hold
stakes valued at $171 million and $166 million, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman's directors and executive officers as a group, 13 people
in all, would hold a stake in the firm valued as high as $1.43
billion. Goldman's two largest outside shareholders, Sumitomo Bank
and an educational concern controlled by Hawaii's Bishop Estate
trust, would have stakes worth as much as $1.15 billion and $1.2
billion, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The holdings of Jon Corzine, Goldman's former co-chief executive
who was ousted in a January coup led by Paulson, were not
disclosed, though some analysts said his stake would be roughly
equivalent to that of Paulson. Corzine has said he plans to leave
Goldman after the offering, which is scheduled for May 3.
</P>
<P>
   Other Goldman executives with big holdings include the vice
chairman, Robert J. Hurst, with a $211 million stake, and the chief
financial officer, David A. Viniar, with a $94 million stake. John
L. Weinberg, the former co-chief executive and a current director,
owns shares that would be worth about $24 million.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes have been built up over the years, and the partners
who hold them must hold onto their shares for five years before
selling.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman canceled an initial public offering last September
because of financial volatility at home and abroad that left the
firm with tens of millions of dollars in trading losses.
</P>
<P>
   The offering of a 14.8 percent stake in Wall Street's last
large, privately held investment bank will be priced at between $45
and $55 a share, up from a range of $40 to $50 expected last month.
As detailed in the revised filing, the offering, which would raise
$3.1 billion to $3.8 billion, values all of Goldman at as much as
$25.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Valued at the high end of that trading range, Goldman would rank
as the third-largest investment bank in the country behind Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, which has a market value of about $63.4
billion, and Merrill Lynch, which is valued at about $36 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that the revised offering price is entirely
reasonable and even expected,'' said John Keefe, president of Keefe
Worldwide, a financial-services consulting firm in New York.
``Market conditions make that almost mechanical.''
</P>
<P>
   The revised offering price was first disclosed in The Wall
Street Journal Monday and coincides with an international sales
push this week by Goldman aimed at wooing investors worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   In a nod to the rich valuations investors are placing on any
stock even remotely connected to the Internet, Goldman _ although
still a neophyte when it comes to cyberspace _ emphasized a nascent
Internet strategy in the offering document. Goldman noted its
investments in electronic commerce concerns and the development of
its online capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The offering also disclosed more about Goldman's finances and
reveals just how dependent the firm is on highly unpredictable _
and often risky _ trading revenue.
</P>
<P>
   For its first quarter, which ended in February, Goldman earned
$1 billion on revenue of $3 billion, compared with $884 million on
revenue of $2.5 billion in the quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Trading remains Goldman's dominant line of business, making up
$1.36 billion of the revenue in the quarter, while investment
banking contributed $902 million. Revenue from asset management was
$736 million in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Within the trading operation, bond trading brought in $876
million in revenue and equity trading brought about $455 million.
Within the investment banking unit, Goldman's vaunted
mergers-and-acquisitions business had revenue of $522 million,
while underwriting had revenue of $380 million.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman earned $1.3 billion on revenue of $8.5 billion for the
fiscal year that ended Nov. 30. Trading losses caused Goldman's
fourth-quarter pretax profit to fall 81 percent, to $107 million,
its worst quarter in four years, down from $567 million in the
quarter a year earlier. Those losses helped undermine Corzine's
standing at the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman also named two new directors to its board, increasing
its size to 13. The new members are Sir John Browne, chief
executive of BP Amoco PLC, and James A. Johnson, chairman of Fannie
Mae, the mortgage-financing giant.
</P>
<P>
   Signaling that the firm has faith that South Korea's economy
will strengthen, Goldman also confirmed Monday that it had agreed
to buy a 17 percent stake in Kookmin Bank, a South Korean consumer
bank once owned by the government, for about $500 million.

CHINA'S EXPORTS FALL 7.9 PERCENT IN QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ China's exports fell 7.9 percent in the first
quarter, the government said Monday in a report that illustrated a
weakness in one of the most important growth engines in the Chinese
economy. Sharp declines in exports to Europe more than offset
increased exports to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Economists are anxiously watching for signs that China's
economy, the largest in Asia behind Japan's, may stumble into the
same downward spiral that has hurt several Asian nations. A fall in
exports, in particular, could increase the pressure on China to
devalue its currency, the yuan, to help make those exports cheaper
and more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   But economists said that even with falling exports, it was
unlikely that China would devalue any time this year. A devaluation
could also force other developing countries to devalue their
currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Economists also point to other signs of economic strength in
China, notably an 11.6 percent increase in first-quarter imports
and an 8.3 percent overall economic growth rate in the
January-March period.
</P>
<P>
   The trade figures were released as business executives in China
expressed disappointment at China's failure to win entry into the
World Trade Organization, the group that makes the rules for global
commerce, during a trip to the United States by Prime Minister Zhu
Rongji. That setback was apparently caused more by politics in
Washington than by serious differences among trade negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu, Beijing's strongest advocate of dismantling China's trade
barriers, may now be vulnerable to critics in Beijing who oppose
making significant concessions that open China's markets to greater
international competition.
</P>
<P>
   But China's politics are so secretive that any diminishing of
Zhu's standing would only become evident slowly. On Monday, China's
media reported positively on the WTO negotiations, stressing
secondary agreements that were made and the commitment by
Washington and Beijing to reach agreement on China's membership in
the trade organization by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   China's fall in exports came principally from weaker demand from
Europe, Chinese officials said, citing a 9.1 percent drop in
exports to Europe in the first two months of the year. In contrast,
China's exports to the United States grew by 8.4 percent in the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``China's exports to the European Union do not look promising in
the first half of this year,'' Sun Zhenyu, deputy foreign trade
minister, said at a weekend seminar on the euro, Europe's single
currency. ``The launch of the euro has created more competition to
Chinese exports.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun said that the euro's decline against the dollar of roughly 9
percent this year depressed demand for Chinese goods in the
European Union. Southern members of the European Union that produce
goods at relatively low costs gained some price advantages over
Chinese goods.
</P>
<P>
   China's exports to neighboring countries in Asia have fallen
sharply over the last year as the Asian economic crisis has
diminished demand in countries like South Korea, Indonesia and
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   The New China News Agency reported that exports to those
countries rose in the first quarter, though the agency gave no
figures.
</P>
<P>
   For all of 1998, exports grew by just 0.5 percent, compared with
20.9 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Positive signs also lurked in the mixed economic data coming out
of China on Monday. The most notable was a 21 percent rise in March
imports, which suggested an increase in domestic demand _ evidence
of economic strength.
</P>
<P>
   Rising imports are also seen as another reason that a
devaluation of the yuan is unlikely for the time being. Those
imports include many materials for assembly into products that are
exported, so a devaluation would make those materials more
expensive for Chinese exporters to buy.

CHINESE OFFICIALS FRUSTRATED BY ADMINISTRATION'S WAVERING ON TRADE
DEAL
</HEADLINE>
  (Subs 10th graf for rewriting; subs to kill 12th graf to delete
redundancies.) 
 (sw) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ When President Clinton visited China last summer, he
and China's top leader, Jiang Zemin, held a press conference
broadcast live around China in which they discussed every sensitive
issue in U.S.-China relations, from Tibet to allegations of illegal
Chinese donations to American political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, some fellow Chinese leaders considered it perhaps
the biggest risk Jiang had taken in the decade since he assumed
Chinas top political titles, an unprecedented concession to demands
for more political openness. The Chinese public had never before
seen live broadcasts of a U.S. president, much less one debating
head-to-head with his media-shy Chinese counterpart. The
risk-taking paid off when Clinton's visit was judged a success by
both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Just 10 months later, Prime Minister Zhu Rongji has complained
at every stop on his six-city tour of the United States that
Clinton ``does not dare'' to take what he considers to be a much
smaller political risk: allowing China to join the World Trade
Organization under terms that even Clinton's own trade negotiators
considered a slam dunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know our American counterparts very well. We have been
negotiating this agreement for 13 years,'' said senior Chinese
official traveling with Zhu who had close involvement in the talks.
``When you are doing these things for so long, you know when you
have a deal. We had a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials accompanying Zhu on his visit pointed to this
asymmetry _ Jiang taking the gamble of his political life, Clinton
overruling his own staff _ as an illustration of what they see as
endless frustration in their dealings with the United States. Yes,
they say, democracies work differently from dictatorships, but that
does not justify what they perceive as Clinton's intolerable
fickleness.
</P>
<P>
   The frustration has built even as officials gush about Zhu's
visit to America. The prime minister has shown that he can stand
face to face with he best American politicians and argue
persuasively for his views, they say. He might even succeeded in
rallying public support for China's entry into the trade
organization, though some Chinese officials have been known to
overestimate the political influence that business leaders have.
</P>
<P>
   That confidence was in evidence on Monday when 1,500
businessmen, including chief executives of Motorola, United
Airlines, Bank One and a dozen other companies based in the
Midwest, gathered at a Chicago banquet for Zhu. With the prime
minister seated at the podium, several chief executives vowed their
support for China's entry as Zhu nodded in appreciation. Commerce
Secretary William Daley, in town for the occasion, also assured Zhu
that China's admission ``is not a question of if, but when.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials also reacted favorably to word that some 100
businessmen showed up for a White House briefing on China trade
talks on Monday. Several executives who attended complained that
the Clinton administration misread both public and congressional
sentiment when it scuttled the deal with China, according to
participants.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Galvin, Motorola's chief executive, said that
support for China's entry into the WTO has gelled enough during
Zhu's visit that he wishes the prime minister had visited
Washington at the end of his nine-day stay instead of at the
beginning. ``Then we might have a deal,'' Galvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such optimism, the damage from Clinton's wavering may
run deep. One of Zhu's top aides, likely reflecting the views of
other pro-Western officials in China's political hierarchy, said
Clinton's role in the trade talks was not unlike his decision in
1995 to bow to congressional pressure and allow President Lee
Teng-Hui of Taiwan to visit the United States. Although Lee's visit
to Cornell University, his alma mater, was billed as private,
Beijing, which views Taiwan as a renegade province, saw it as an
attempt to bolster the island's official status.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as now, Congress appeared to make China policy instead of
the White House, said this aide, who declined to be identified
further. Then, as now, Clinton intervened at the last moment and
overturned an approach that had the firm backing of his China
experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton's memory is short,'' this Chinese official said. ``Our
memory is longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that while China's foreign policy puts
relations with the United States at the top of the agenda, the
United States juggles many international priorities. It is no
coincidence, one Chinese official said, that Clinton rejected a
trade deal as the United States led the NATO assault on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration insists that China is a high
priority. But Chinese officials doubt that. The administration, for
example, has so far failed to find a suitable replacement from its
ambassador to China, James Sasser, who has made his intention of
leaving that post known for months.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The war in Yugoslavia is also a direct affront to the two major
pillars of China's foreign policy, peace and noninterference in the
internal affairs of sovereign countries. Where the United States
sees a severe humanitarian crisis, China sees the threat of foreign
intervention in Taiwan and Tibet, its own restive regions.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the biggest worry, at least among Zhu's aides, is
their fear that the Clinton administration did not appreciate the
delicate nature of the process that produced China's revised bid to
join the WTO.
</P>
<P>
   China has sought entry to the trade body for 13 years, but it
has really made only two strong pushes for membership. The first
came in 1994, when the WTO was born of its predecessor, known as
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The application then
came amid a rush of economic reforms. Chinese officials made GATT
the symbol of its modernization drive, only to have the United
States block entry.
</P>
<P>
   China's interest in joining the trade body, which requires
demolition of tariffs and trade barriers that shield many
inefficient sectors of its economy from outside competition, faded
in the intervening years. It was fully revived only late last year.
Then, Zhu, newly appointed prime minister, made entry into the
trade organization his personal mission.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese trade officials said that never before had a senior
Chinese leader taken an interest in the details of negotiations the
way Zhu did.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you don't have a senior leader involved in the details,
then the negotiators cannot get instructions,'' said a trade
official. ``Without Zhu, it would never have been smooth.''
</P>
<P>
   Crucially, the push to join the trade body became the symbol of
a new stage in China's reform program. Economic reforms previously
focused on agriculture and manufacturing industries. But the new
drive aimed at opening the country's undeveloped service sector _
telecommunications, banking, consulting, accounting, entertainment
and many other areas _ to both domestic and foreign competition.
</P>
<P>
   With the Asian financial crisis dragging down growth in China
and the country flooded with over-investment in unproductive
industries, the opening of services was seen as one of the few ways
to promote quality economic growth. The trade organization offered
a framework to change myriad internal Chinese rules and regulations
that keep services off limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Service sector reform and the WTO are the same thing for
China,'' said this trade official. ``We won't get one without the
other.''
</P>
<P>
   China could still get both if negotiations pick up where they
left off before Clinton pulled the plug. But the Chinese side,
while publicly indicating continued support for a deal, privately
frets that restoring momentum will be tricky.
</P>
<P>
   There are no more scheduled visits of Chinese or American senior
leaders. The Clinton administration, which the Chinese already view
as weak, may see its remaining clout to push a trade deal through
Congress only diminish as Clinton approaches the end of his term.
And, perhaps most worrying for the Chinese, trade was supposed to
be the unbreakable bond between the two countries that keeps them
talking even when military, diplomatic and human rights concerns
strain ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trade is the one area where our two interests are really in
line,'' the Chinese trade negotiator said. ``So if we don't even
agree on trade, the outlook is not so good.''

POLICE DEFEND WORK IN ABORTION-CLINIC DOCTOR'S SLAYING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Responding to questions about why it took almost six
months to find a rifle that may have been used to kill a Buffalo,
N.Y.,-area doctor who performed abortions, law enforcement
officials defended the thoroughness of their investigation on
Monday and said metal detectors had been used soon after the
killing to scan the area around the doctor's home, though with no
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``All agencies are pursuing this case aggressively,'' said Major
Michael McManus, the troop commander of the New York State Police
in western New York and one of the few officials willing to comment
on the inquiry into the death of Dr. Barnett Slepian.
</P>
<P>
   The rifle was found on Thursday buried about a foot below the
surface in piney woods roughly 200 feet behind Slepian's residence,
where he was killed by a sniper on Oct. 23. A short statement by
law enforcement officials said that ``weather and ground
conditions'' in the days after the slaying delayed the kind of
refined search that turned up the rifle.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and neighbors of the family have asked why the rifle was
not found sooner, pointing out that last autumn was fairly warm and
dry and that heavy snowfall did not start until January. Some
independent investigators also wondered why the gun had not been
found sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're looking for a gun, it's one of the easiest things to
use a metal detector to find,'' said Michael G. Cherkasky, a former
prosecutor who is chief operating officer of Kroll Associates, a
private investigative firm.
</P>
<P>
   Replying to such comments, a federal and a state law enforcement
official, both of whom refused to be identified, said Monday that
the grounds behind the doctor's home in Amherst, N.Y., had been
thoroughly searched in the weeks after the slaying. Some of the
searches were conducted by hand, but a metal detector was also
used, they said. One of the officials said using a detector could
be a ``hit or miss'' proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have not said how the rifle was found, nor have they
described it other than to say it resembled the weapon that would
have fired the caliber of bullet that killed Slepian. It has been
taken to Washington for ballistics tests.
</P>
<P>
   The contention that the authorities were diligent was partly
bolstered by the account of two of the Slepian family's neighbors,
Sandy Arno and Mary Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   They recalled that in the days after the slaying, they saw a
line of at least a dozen investigators working shoulder to
shoulder, sometimes on their hands and knees, searching the four
acres of backyards and woods behind the Slepians' house.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Arno and Mrs. Wilson do not recall seeing anyone using a
metal detector. ``It struck me as so amazing that they found
strands of hair but not a rifle because they seemed to be doing
such a thorough job,'' Mrs. Arno said. ``It seemed extremely
well-organized.''
</P>
<P>
   Slepian, the mainstay of Buffalo's only clinic still performing
abortions, was shot to death at 10 p.m. as he stood in his kitchen
talking with his wife and sons. The sniper hid in a stand of trees
about 100 feet behind the house, which is surrounded by a fenced-in
yard that encloses a swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   The rifle found on Thursday, which has not yet been positively
identified as the murder weapon, was unearthed 100 feet deeper in
the woods near one of several paths the Arnos have carved out for
walking dogs and for children to caper. Monday, the water-filled
trench created by the digging was marked by mustard-colored spray.
</P>
<P>
   An expert in metal detectors said they can be unfailingly
accurate if they are properly adjusted to seek a specific metal.
Sean Rabbani, owner of A&AMP;S Co. in Santa Clara, Calif., a large
distributor of the devices, said a detector of conventional quality
could sense metals as deep as a foot and a half below the surface,
and some can detect metal as deep as 20 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The iron or steel in a gun, he said, would require settings for
``lower discrimination'' than the quarters a beachcomber might look
for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they didn't know how to use it,'' Rabbani said. ``If I
was there I would find it in a couple of acres in eight hours.''
</P>
<P>
   The police have not yet named a suspect in the slaying, but they
have issued a warrant for the arrest of James C. Kopp as a material
witness. Kopp, who has made a practice of joining abortion protests
across the country, was seen jogging in the neighborhood in the
days before Slepian was killed.
</P>
<P>
   A federal law enforcement official said Monday that the
authorities did not know where Kopp was, and he indicated that he
did not believe reports that Kopp may have fled to Mexico.

 &HT;    High court considers 'wrongful birth' suit
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Parents should be able to sue their obstetricians for
medical malpractice if doctors fail to properly diagnose birth
defects in a fetus, the Georgia Supreme Court was told Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Without proper genetic testing and counseling, a mother's right
to an abortion is infringed because she was denied the chance to be
fully informed about the health of the fetus, Atlanta lawyer Myles
Eastwood told the court during oral arguments. If obstetricians
fail to provide the standard care, they should be liable in
``wrongful birth'' lawsuits, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The high court considered a medical malpractice lawsuit filed by
Andrew and Jennifer Etkind against their obstetrician, Ramon
Suarez, who practices at Piedmont Hospital. According to the
lawsuit, Suarez did not conduct all the customary prenatal tests on
the Etkinds' fetus, born in September 1995 with Down syndrome,
brain defects and other deformities.
</P>
<P>
   The Etkinds said they would have aborted their fetus had they
known of the birth defects, and the couple wants Suarez to pay for
the extraordinary costs of raising their son. Suarez has strongly
denied allegations that his prenatal care was below standard.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years ago, the seven-member Supreme Court addressed the
wrongful birth issue, but prohibited these kinds of lawsuits,
saying the matter should be left to the Legislature. But five new
justices have since joined the court.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice Robert Benham, who was on the court in 1990 and
said at the time that wrongful birth lawsuits should be allowed,
expressed uneasiness about overturning precedent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Precedent is the court's stock and trade, allowing
predictability and certainty in the law,'' he said. ``Under what
circumstances should the court abandon that?''
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood agreed it would be ``unusual'' for the court to abandon
its precedent, but noted that 28 states now allow wrongful birth
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta lawyer Judson Graves, who represents Suarez, urged the
court not to overturn its 1990 precedent, and he said that allowing
wrongful birth suits ``denigrates people who are genetically
inferior.''
</P>
<P>
   If the court allows wrongful birth lawsuits, obstetricians will
be more willing to perform amniocentesis on mothers who express
even the slightest concerns about the condition of a fetus, Graves
said, noting this invasive procedure can cause a miscarriage.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Norman Fletcher, who wrote the 1990 decision, said that
genetic testing is becoming so refined that in the ``not too
distant future'' doctors may be able to determine all sorts of
characteristics about the fetus.
</P>
<P>
   He asked where the courts draw the line.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood replied that obstetricians set their own standards for
genetic counseling and care.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they violate their own standards, they should be held
actionable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The court has until early December before it has to issue a
ruling.

ANALYSIS: FOR CLINTON, A JARRING LEGAL AFTERSHOCK 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CLINTON-CONTEMPT) 
(mk) 
 By JILL ABRAMSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Having survived impeachment, President Clinton and his defenders
had hoped that the legal repercussions from the Monica Lewinsky
imbroglio were over. By holding Clinton in contempt on Monday,
Judge Susan Webber Wright dashed those hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Where the president has denounced congressional charges of legal
wrongdoing in the Lewinsky matter as partisan, he will have a more
difficult time dismissing Wright's ruling, which noted, in her
dispassionate and lawyerly 32-page order, that she ``takes no
pleasure whatsoever in holding this nation's president in contempt
of court.''
</P>
<P>
   In a rare show of restraint, White House lawyers and the
president's personal lawyer said they would not comment on the
ruling until they had a chance to read it.
</P>
<P>
   Because the president is the highest law-enforcement official in
the land and the nation's highest court officer, the contempt of
court finding is another embarrassing mark on Clinton's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Although Wright said she would delay enforcement for 30 days to
give the president and his lawyers a chance to ask for a hearing or
file a notice of appeal, her ruling is more than symbolic. Clinton
has already settled the Paula Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit in
which Wright cited him for contempt, but her ruling could have
important legal and practical effects on him.
</P>
<P>
   One is monetary. Wright ordered the president to pay $1,202 to
cover her expenses for traveling to Washington for the president's
deposition in the Jones case on January 17, 1998. Ms. Jones'
lawyers may also submit their expenses connected to the deposition
for reimbursement because Wright has found that Clinton's false
testimony ``tainted'' the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling could also effect the president's future earnings, if
he ever intends to practice law in Arkansas after he leaves office.
Having found that he gave ``intentionally false'' testimony in the
Jones case and found him in contempt of court, Wright said she
would refer the matter to the Arkansas Supreme Court's Committee on
Professional Conduct. The disciplinary panel could sanction
Clinton, including moving to disbar him. The American Bar
Association's Model Rules of Professional Responsibility make it
clear that giving false testimony is misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   No other president has ever been held in civil contempt, and it
is rare for high government officials to be faced with such
charges. Last February, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin were cited for civil contempt by
U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth in Washington for failure to
comply with the judge's orders in a case involving Indian trusts.
</P>
<P>
   But the charges against these officials involved their
government duties, not the kind of private misconduct for which the
president was cited for giving false testimony in the Jones case.
In other lawsuits, judges have used civil contempt citations, some
with jail terms, to enforce their rulings.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's ruling came on the same day as the verdict in the
criminal contempt trial of Susan MacDougal, a former Arkansas
business partner of the Clintons. She served 18 months in jail for
civil contempt because she would not answer questions from the
office of the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, in a high-profile family court case, an
investment banker was jailed for three years and cited for civil
contempt for refusing to comply with a judge's order to pay child
support.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Saltzburg, a professor of criminal law and procedure at
George Washington University Law School in Washington, said parties
to lawsuits were seldom held in civil contempt for false testimony.
More commonly, people are fined for violations of court discovery
rules.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Wright formally cited the president for contempt,
Saltzburg said, ``suggests that the violation is probably clearer
and more reprehensible than some.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she wanted to make it clear that the president flouted
the dignity of the court and insulted the court,'' Saltzburg added.

BRAZIL'S STEEP RATES SQUEEZE CONSUMERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Eliana Nascimento's trip to the beaches of
Australia was her first vacation abroad. The interest rate her bank
is charging could make it her last.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other Brazilian travelers, Ms. Nascimento, a
25-year-old advertising executive, was shocked upon her return home
in mid-January. The government had just devalued the currency, the
real, so her purchases on credit in Australia almost doubled when
translated into reals.
</P>
<P>
   Her savings exhausted by the trip, she used the overdraft
privilege offered by Banco Bradesco to write a check for the
credit-card bill. That's when she got her second rude shock. The
bank had raised the interest rate on overdrafts, already high at
104 percent a year, to 140 percent, after its borrowing costs got
higher.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few weeks she got her third rude shock. Interest
rates charged to banks have declined to pre-devaluation levels. But
the banks have not passed on the lower borrowing rates to their
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They give no truce to their small clients, like me, who are
struggling right now,'' said Ms. Nascimento, whose office is a
short stroll from Avenida Paulista, a mile-long thoroughfare of
skyscrapers and futuristic billboards that symbolize Brazil's
powerful banks.
</P>
<P>
   Many Brazilians are repeating Ms. Nascimento's complaint. The
banks were quick to raise rates for customers but have been slow to
lower them.
</P>
<P>
   As gloomy prospects for the economy have subsided, the central
bank has responded by cutting its main lending rate to banks twice
in the last two weeks, from 45 percent to 39 percent, the
pre-devaluation rate. Another cut could come as soon as Tuesday or
Wednesday, with analysts expecting the rate to decline to below 35
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although still high when compared with borrowing costs in many
other countries, this decline in interest rates here has
strengthened investor confidence in the economy and has benefited
financial institutions probably more than any other economic
sector.
</P>
<P>
   Already two of Brazil's biggest banks, Banco Bradesco and Banco
Itau, have successfully tapped borrowing markets abroad through the
sale of dollar-denominated notes, the first such transactions since
the currency was devalued in mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   The improved outlook for the economy as a whole, though, and for
banks in particular, has yet to trickle down from the boardrooms of
Sao Paulo and the bureaucratic corridors of Brasilia to many
hard-pressed people.
</P>
<P>
   Although Brazilians have lived with at least double-digit
interest rates since the beginning of an economic stabilization
program begun by President Fernando Henrique Cardoso in 1994, their
patience is waning.
</P>
<P>
   ``After taking a loan out last year, I told myself, `Never
again,''' said Ana Cecilia Ribas de Aguiar, 40, the owner of a
language school, who paid a monthly interest of 4.75 percent on her
small-business loan _ an annual rate that exceeds 60 percent. ``I
was shown how greedy banks can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ribas de Aguiar reacted by attempting to switch banks, to
see if competition would reduce her costs. But, she said,
``switching banks is like switching husbands; it's such a hassle.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The resentment expressed by Ms. Ribas de Aguiar has been
heightened because banks are one of the main fixtures of
middle-class life here. In this city, Brazil's largest and richest,
a customer's bank is often a signal of social standing.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, exclusive institutions, including foreign banks
such as Citibank and BankBoston, require a high minimum salary from
prospective customers. Other banks with more extensive branch
networks and less flashy exteriors, such as the state-owned Banco
do Brasil, have a more plebeian reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilians also have to spend a large amount of their time each
month at their banks since almost all bills must be paid directly
in branches, because the postal system is not trusted for sending
personal checks. And the millions of Brazilians too poor to open a
bank account have to go to branches to cash their paychecks,
however meager they may be.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Internet is changing things somewhat, through the
introduction of online payment methods, it is still common to see
lines at banks stretch out onto the street with people waiting to
pay their rent or utility bills.
</P>
<P>
   Banks, for their part, respond to customer anger over interest
rates by suggesting that their hands are largely tied. Even if the
cost of borrowing has come down for the banks themselves since the
turmoil following the devaluation, many banks say they must
continue to charge higher rates because the economy has been
weakened and more customers could default.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the rates we charge can be punitive,'' said Antonio
Bornia, the vice chairman of Banco Bradesco, the largest bank in
Brazil that is not government-owned. ``But we're going through a
recession in which employment levels are not favorable and the risk
levels of many potential borrowers remain quite high.''
</P>
<P>
   Another banker, Rogerio Estevao, the director of products at
Unibanco, a large Sao Paulo-based bank, said: ``We have to wait and
see if this current scenario of optimism will continue. I see some
space for small declines in rates but not that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the growing resentment against banks, together with
reports of fattened profits at some institutions so far this year,
has been transformed into an issue by some legislators in Brasilia.
Following the currency devaluation, one legislator, Aloizio
Mercadante of Sao Paulo, contended that several banks used inside
information to profit from the shift in exchange-rate policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're dealing with now is a society with violence and
unemployment on the rise, while the government seems to go out of
its way to help financial institutions,'' Mercadante said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Mercadante, a member of the left-wing opposition Workers'
Party, and some of his colleagues in the Chamber of Deputies and
the Senate are pressing forward with plans for a congressional
inquiry into his charges, in addition to allegations of an
unethical, and perhaps, illegal, bailout by the central bank of two
small Rio de Janeiro investment banks. The central bank is
conducting its own investigation of the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiries into bank misbehavior are not lost on Ms.
Nascimento, the advertising executive. Now, as she struggles to pay
expenses as basic as her telephone bill, she does not know when she
will get the chance to travel outside Brazil again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I could have planned something modest, like a
weekend in Buenos Aires,'' she said. ``Now, I'm not sure if I'll
take any vacation at all.''

IN JUDGMENT OF A TEACHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (See related CLINTON-CONTEMPT)  
 (af)  
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Judge Susan Webber Wright found Bill Clinton
in contempt of court, she was ruling not just against the president
of the United States but against one of her former teachers.
</P>
<P>
   More than two decades ago, Susan Webber studied navigation law
under Professor Bill Clinton at the University of Arkansas School
of Law, where she was editor of the Arkansas Law Review and
graduated in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's student was also his political adversary: a
conservative Republican, she campaigned on behalf of Rep. John Paul
Hammerschmidt, whom Clinton tried to unseat in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   She was a clerk for Judge J. Smith Henley of the 8th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, covering much of the Middle West, then
taught law at her alma mater and two other universities before
being named to the federal district court by President George Bush
in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Married to Robert R. Wright III, a prominent legal scholar,
Judge Wright, 50, has won praise in Arkansas legal circles for her
intellectual acumen and sense of fair play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think a judge should be a personality,'' she said in
an interview several years ago. ``My focus is to be fair to all
sides.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Gov. Bill Clinton appointed the judge's husband to be
the special chief justice on the Arkansas Supreme Court to review
the appeal of a conviction of a former state official.
</P>
<P>
   In previous rulings in the sexual-misconduct suit brought by
Paula Jones, Judge Wright has sided with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In a decision overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court, she ruled in
late 1994 that the trial of Ms. Jones' lawsuit should wait until
the president left office.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, she dismissed part of the suit, and on April 1, 1998,
she threw it out altogether. (Ms. Jones and the president later
reached a settlement.)
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, she handed down a decision that, if it caused
discomfort for the president, seemed to sadden the judge, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court takes no pleasure whatsoever in holding this
nation's president in contempt of court,'' she wrote.

BIN LADEN'S MESSAGE MORE POWERFUL THAN HIS MEANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS 3rd graf to add 2nd sentence on informants having no
direct knowledge of bin Laden's involvement in embassy bombings. 
 (nk) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   American commandos are poised near the Afghan border, hoping to
capture Osama bin Laden, the man charged with blowing up two
American embassies in Africa eight months ago, senior American
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   But they still do not know how to find him. They are depending
on his protectors in Afghanistan to betray him _ a slim reed of
hope for one of the biggest and most complicated international
criminal investigations in American history.
</P>
<P>
   Capturing bin Laden alive could deepen the complications.
American officials say that so far, firsthand evidence that could
be used in court to prove that he commanded the bombings has proven
difficult to obtain. &UR;  &LR; According to the public record, none of the
informants involved in the case have direct knowledge of bin
Laden's involvement.
</P>
<P>
   For now, federal prosecutors appear to be building a case that
his violent words and ideas, broadcast from an Afghan cave, incited
terrorist acts thousands of miles away.
</P>
<P>
   In their self-declared war with bin Laden, American officials
portray him as the world's most dangerous terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   But reporters for The New York Times and the PBS program
``Frontline,'' working in cooperation, have found him to be less a
commander of terrorists than an inspiration for them.
</P>
<P>
   Enemies and supporters, from members of the Saudi opposition to
present and former American intelligence officials, say he may not
be as globally powerful as some American officials have asserted.
But his message and aims have more resonance among Muslims around
the world than has been understood here.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can kill Osama bin Laden today or tomorrow; you can arrest
him and put him on trial in New York or in Washington,'' said Ahmed
Sattar, an aide to Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, the blind Egyptian
cleric convicted of inspiring the bombing of the World Trade Center
in 1993. ``If this will end the problem _ no. Tomorrow you will get
somebody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with senior American officials and knowledgeable
observers of bin Laden in Pakistan, Sudan and elsewhere suggest
that there is widespread support among ordinary people in the
Muslim world for his central political argument: that American
troops should get out of Saudi Arabia. The embassy bombings, they
note, took place eight years to the day after the GI's were ordered
onto Saudi soil.
</P>
<P>
   The interviews also raise questions about key assertions that
have been made by the government about bin Laden. Senior
intelligence officials concede that their knowledge of him is
sketchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't say for sure what was going on'' with him from 1991
to 1996 _ most of the years covered in the indictment _ one senior
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Present and former American officials and former business
associates of bin Laden say he appears to control only a fraction
of the $250 million fortune that the American government says he
possesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, his money's running out,'' said Frank Anderson, a
former senior CIA official who maintains close Middle Eastern
contacts.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Johnson, the State Department deputy counterterrorism
director from 1988 to 1993, said administration officials had
``tended to make Osama bin Laden sort of a Superman in Muslim garb
_ he's 10 feet tall, he's everywhere, he knows everything, he's got
lots of money and he can't be challenged.''
</P>
<P>
   Milton Bearden, a retired senior CIA official who ran the
agency's war in Afghanistan and retired in 1995, said the
government had ``created a North Star'' in bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is public enemy No. 1,'' Bearden said. ``We've got a $5
million reward out for his head. And now we have, with I'm not sure
what evidence, linked him to all of the terrorist acts of this year
_ of this decade, perhaps.''
</P>
<P>
   Political leaders in Sudan and Pakistan who have met bin Laden
describe him as intelligent, soft-spoken, polite. They also say he
is deadly serious about his violent brand of radical politics and
capable of killing in God's name.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden was born into the ruling class of Saudi Arabia. His
father was the favorite construction magnate of the Saudi royal
family, who gave bin Laden's family huge contracts to renovate the
holy cities of Mecca and Medina and build palaces for Saudi
princes.
</P>
<P>
   American officials calculated bin Laden's fortune by estimating
the family fortune at $5 billion and dividing by 20 _ the number of
male heirs. But business associates of bin Laden said his family
cut him off years ago, and are managing his share of his
inheritance for him as long as he is disowned. Business associates
say bin Laden has been living on a generous allowance from his
eldest brother and that his assets in Saudi Arabia are now frozen.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, at 22, bin Laden left Saudi Arabia and moved to the
Afghan frontier. In Peshawar, Pakistan, bin Laden _ working
alongside, but never directly allied with, the CIA _ used his money
and his machines to help the Afghan rebels fight the Soviet Army
invaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Afghan war shaped bin Laden, those who know him say. ``He is
an ordinary person who is very religious,'' said President Omar
Bashir of Sudan, who met bin Laden often between 1992 and 1996.
``He believes in the rule of Islam and where possible the
establishment of an Islamic state. The time that he spent in
Afghanistan led him to believe that this might be achieved through
military means.''
</P>
<P>
   Legend has it that bin Laden fought bravely against Soviet
troops. But former CIA officers say he was a financier, not a
warrior _ ``a philanthropist supporting a number of health care,
widows-and-orphans charity operations in Peshawar for Afghan
refugees,'' as Anderson put it.
</P>
<P>
   He also helped create a headquarters called Al Qaeda, the Base.
It was a way station in Peshawar where Egyptian and Saudi
volunteers rested before setting off for battle in Afghanistan. Its
name became a kind of flag uniting bin Laden's followers. American
officials call it a global terrorist network.
</P>
<P>
   When the Soviet forces left Afghanistan in 1989, bin Laden went
home to Saudi Arabia. He soon set his sights on the last remaining
superpower.
</P>
<P>
   ``He himself was very much wary about America,'' said Saad
al-Faqih, a Saudi exile living in London, who worked as a surgeon
for wounded Afghan fighters, ``very skeptical about America and the
Saudi regime.''
</P>
<P>
   He found a new enemy on Aug. 7, 1990, when the United States
began sending half a million soldiers to Saudi Arabia, preparing
for war against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the stories put out by bin Laden is that he went to
King Fahd and promised that he would raise holy warriors who would
protect Saudi Arabia,'' said Anderson, who was the chief of the
CIA's Near East operations in the mid-1990s. ``His violent
opposition to the Saudi royal family began when King Fahd denied or
rejected that offer.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To bin Laden, the deployment of Americans in the land of Mecca
and Medina smacked of the Crusades, the Christian religious wars
against Islam that began nine centuries ago. His rage transformed
him into a stateless outlaw.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1991, Saudi intelligence officers caught bin Laden
smuggling weapons from Yemen, his father's homeland. They withdrew
his passport. Soon afterward he made his way to Sudan, which had
decreed its borders open to all Muslims, with or without passports
or visas.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans of the Afghan jihad, or Holy War, against Moscow
followed bin Laden, under Al Qaeda's banner. But ``when Al Qaeda
was moved to Sudan, it lost around 70 percent of its members,''
Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, accused of being an associate of bin Laden,
said during an interrogation by German police after his arrest in
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``This group didn't have a purpose except to carry out the
jihad, and since nobody carried out the jihad, it lost a lot of its
members,'' Salim said.
</P>
<P>
   There were three kinds of men in Al Qaeda, he said. First,
``people who had no success in life, had nothing in their heads and
wanted to join just to keep from falling on their noses.'' Second,
``people who loved their religion but had no idea what their
religion really meant.'' And third, ``people who have nothing in
their heads but to fight and solve all the problems in the world
with battles.''
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden lived in Khartoum, the Sudanese capital, ``as an
investor,'' said Bashir. ``With his money, he was adventurous, and
probably he gained this mentality by his experiences as a
fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   The indictment against bin Laden says he provided training camps
in Sudan where Afghan war veterans prepared for terrorist missions.
But a senior American intelligence official contradicted that,
saying, ``There was never a bin Laden-financed training camp in
Sudan.''
</P>
<P>
   The official added: ``In 1993, '94, '95, he's managing and
building up his legitimate business presence there in Sudan. I
won't pretend we've got a good intelligence base on this period,
but we think he was laying the groundwork for Al Qaeda.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 two CIA officers were stalked by teen-age followers of
bin Laden in the streets of Khartoum. ``Bin Laden was approached by
us and was told that this would not be tolerated,'' said Ghazi
Salaheldin, Sudanese information minister. Sudan expelled the
teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of such perceived threats _ though some were
mirages, based on a slew of false CIA reports _ the United States
withdrew from Sudan in late 1995. The absence of American diplomats
and spies in the country diminished Washington's ability to know
what bin Laden was doing at the very moment he stepped up his
political war.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, after the Saudi government rescinded his citizenship,
he began sending scathing attacks on the royal family from
Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bin Laden took a chance and started doing some political
activities,'' Bashir siad, ``not terrorist activities, but he
started issuing political bulletins and communiques and faxes,''
denouncing the Saudi government as corrupt and repressive.
</P>
<P>
   The United States took notice. ``There had been confusion''
after the World Trade Center bombing in 1993 about the nature of
radical Islamic threats to the United States, said Johnson, the
former senior counterterrorism official.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were lots of theories, not very good intelligence, and
so the intelligence community actually started generating a picture
that Osama bin Laden was, if you will, the new face of terrorism,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   On May 31, 1996, four Saudis were beheaded after confessing to
bombing a Saudi National Guard post in Riyadh and killing five
Americans. All told their interrogators that they had received bin
Laden's communiques. Only 25 days later, a truck bomb tore through
a military post in Dhahran, killing 19 American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden was blamed by American officials for instigating the
attacks. But no known evidence implicates him and the Saudi
interior minister, Prince Nayef ibn Abdel Aziz, has absolved him.
``Maybe there are people who adopt his ideas,'' he said. ``He does
not constitute any security problem to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the Dharhan attack, bin Laden and members of his
entourage left the Sudan in aC-130 military transport. The Sudanese
had asked him to leave _ at the request of the United States. Bin
Laden landed at an American-built airport in Kandahar, Afghanistan.
Three months later, on August 23, 1996, he declared war on the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation in Saudi Arabia is like a great volcano about to
erupt,'' his declaration stated. ``Everyone talks openly about
economic recession, high prices, debt'' and ``the filling up of the
prisons.''
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden's criticisms of Saudi repression and corruption
closely corresponded with State Department reports and CIA
analyses. They diverged by blaming the United States. ``The root of
the problem is the occupying American enemy, and all efforts should
focus on killing, fighting and destroying it,'' bin Laden
proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   A second, more ominous warning came on Feb. 23, 1998: ``To kill
Americans and their allies, both civil and military, is an
individual duty of every Muslim who is able, in any country where
this is possible,'' until American armies, ``shattered and
broken-winged, depart from all the lands of Islam.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came August's embassy bombings. American authorities say
the men who attacked the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania were
controlled by bin Laden. But they still have no clear idea how.
</P>
<P>
   Despite efforts at the highest levels of the U.S. government,
bin Laden and his closest associates remain isolated in
Afghanistan, the nation he helped fight Soviet occupation in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to say precisely where the criminal case against
bin Laden stands. Prosecutors have obtained unusually restrictive
court orders that bar the defendants and their lawyers from
communicating with virtually anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, at least, the case has lost momentum. While two
suspected bombers were quickly apprehended, many other suspects are
still at large. The last arrest was more than six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now the hunt for bin Laden depends on whether the Taliban, his
radical hosts in Afghanistan, will betray him. The United States
has little leverage with the Taliban, and little fresh intelligence
on how to capture bin Laden. It has no spies in Afghanistan, and
little new information on precisely how he might have instigated
the deadly bombings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not have a clear picture yet of what happened when,''
said Prudence Bushnell, the U.S. ambassador to Kenya, who was
injured in the bomb blast, which killed 12 of her colleagues. ``I
may not ever have a clear picture of what happened when. None of us
may.''

   MARGARET EDSON
</P>
<P>
   ``Wit''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed somewhat unlikely dramatic fodder, but by weaving
together the sonnets of John Donne with a literature professor's
battle with ovarian cancer, Ms. Edson wrought a play which, Peter
Marks' wrote in his New York Times review, ``finds poetry in the
reading of a sonogram and science in the deconstruction of a
sonnet.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edson, 37, is a first-time playwright and full-time
kindergarten teacher in Atlanta. (She was called out of her
classroom to the principal's office when the award was announced.)
She said that the play, which played Off Off Broadway before moving
to an Off Broadway theater, was inspired by her experiences working
in a cancer and AIDS ward in a hospital in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really about the relationship between love and
knowledge,'' she said Monday. ``And in the end, about grace.''

<P>
   ``Annals of the Former World''
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1978, McPhee crisscrossed the United States to
gather information about the country's formation over billions of
years. The book combines his four previously published volumes on
American geology, including ``Assembling California,'' and adds a
fifth section on the American Midwest. It tells not only geological
history but the history of geology and the stories of the
scientists who have worked out the histories of rock and mountain
from the plains of Brooklyn to the San Andreas fault.

   POETRY
</P>
<P>
   MARK STRAND
</P>
<P>
   ``Blizzard of One''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Strand, who was born in Canada, is the author of nine books
of poetry. He teaches in the Committee on Social Thought at the
University of Chicago. Strand, 65, has been called a ``Platonic''
poet. His verse is spare, magisterial, his themes universal rather
than particular. Thus, in the poem that provides the title for his
prize-winning collection, a snowflake is not simply itself, but
rather a focal point for Strand's meditation on absence and death:
</P>
<P>
   From the shadow of domes in the city of domes,
</P>
<P>
   A snowflake, a blizzard of one, weightless, entered your room
</P>
<P>
   And made its way to the arm of the chair where you, looking up
</P>
<P>
   From your book, saw it the moment it landed. That's all
</P>
<P>
   There was to it. No more than a solemn waking
</P>
<P>
   To brevity, to the lifting and falling away of attention,
swiftly,
</P>
<P>
   A time between times, a flowerless funeral. No more than that
</P>
<P>
   Except for the feeling that this piece of the storm,
</P>
<P>
   Which turned into nothing before your eyes, would come back,
</P>
<P>
   That someone years hence, sitting as you are now, might say:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time. The air is ready. The sky has an opening.''

   BIOGRAPHY
</P>
<P>
   A. SCOTT BERG
</P>
<P>
   ``Lindbergh''
</P>
<P>
   Berg has written three exhaustive biographies. The first two
were of editor Maxwell Perkins and film producer Samuel Goldwyn.
For ``Lindbergh'' (G.P. Putnam's Sons), Berg spent nine years
researching the life of the pioneer aviator whose flight across the
Atlantic in 1927 made him what Berg calls ``the first modern media
superstar.'' Berg, 49, who lives in Los Angeles, found Lindbergh an
immensely complicated figure, cold and distant to his family and
tainted by words of support for Adolf Hitler, but nonetheless a
``solid-gold hero.''

</P>
<P>
   For two decades, Wallace and Burrows labored in the shadows with
``Gotham: A History of New York to 1898'' (Oxford University

   FICTION
</P>
<P>
   MICHAEL CUNNINGHAM
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hours''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Hours'' (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux), Cunningham conjures
a parallel between Virginia Woolf's ``Mrs. Dalloway'' and his own
novel, moving from a fictionalized portrait of Woolf herself in
London in the 1920s to Los Angeles in 1949 and New York in the
1990s. The theme of ``The Hours,'' a reviewer wrote in The New York
Times Book Review, is ``the haunting of present lives by memories
and books, by distant pasts and missed futures, by novels and poems
to be read and written.''
</P>
<P>
   An excerpt from ``The Hours'':
</P>
<P>
   ``It had seemed like the beginning of happiness, and Clarissa is
still sometimes shocked, more than 30 years later, to realize that
it was happiness. ... There is still that singular perfection, and
it's perfect in part because it seemed, at the time, so clearly to
promise more. Now she knows: That was the moment, right then. There
has been no other.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, who was born in Cincinnati in 1952, graduated from
Stanford University and the University of Iowa. He teaches writing
at Columbia University.

   MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   MELINDA WAGNER
</P>
<P>
   Concerto for Flute, Strings and Percussion
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wagner, a 42-year-old composer who was born in Philadelphia
and lives in Ridgewood, N.J., is an imaginative musical fantasist
who once described her accessible, inviting music as ``not really
about anything that could happen in the world, but about the
exploration and potential of ideas concerning sound.'' In her
three-movement concerto, considerable expressive variety is
demanded of the solo flute line, which is set against a sparkling,
tactile orchestral texture. The work was given its premiere by Paul
Dunkel, the flutist, with the Westchester Philharmonic on May 31,
1998.
</P>
<P>
   SPECIAL CITATION
</P>
<P>
   DUKE ELLINGTON
</P>
<P>
   On the centennial of his birth, the Pulitzer Prize Board cited
Edward Kennedy (Duke) Ellington for his indelible contribution to
art and culture through the medium of jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Duke Ellington's protean career, lasting over 50 years,
connected jazz's beginnings before the 1920s with its most modern
aspects in the 1970s. From his earliest recordings until his death
in 1974, he strengthened his command of jazz composition and
arrangement. By the 1940s, at the helm of an 18-piece band, he was
one of the most innovative and popular composers in America,
bridging the realms of dance music and sophisticated art song.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1943, Ellington composed a string of tone poems,
suites and sacred music, including ``Black, Brown and Beige'' and
``Such Sweet Thunder.'' His final extended pieces were the
liturgical ``Sacred Concerts.''

</P>
<P>
   In its series ``Deadly Force,'' The Post concluded that District
of Columbia officers shot and killed more people per resident than
any other large city police force.
</P>
<P>
   A Post reporter suspected that the FBI collected but did not
disclose police-shooting data. Through repeated requests under the
Freedom of Information Act, the Post's computer-assisted reporting
team got the data and then analyzed it. Then reporters reviewed
previous homicides, talked to the police and prosecutors and at one
point test-fired police handguns.
</P>
<P>
   The Post concluded that shootings were so numerous because of
poor police training, hair-trigger handguns and questionable
tactics, like shooting at moving cars.

   The Apollo Theater on 125th Street in Harlem may once have been
``where stars are born and legends are made,'' as its motto avers.
But more recently, the historic theater has been in decay, as
editorial writers from The Daily News discovered during a visit in
March 1998, said Michael Goodwin, editor of the editorial page.
</P>
<P>
   The News' editorial board began a campaign to rescue the
theater, which is now owned by the state and run by a foundation. A
series of editorials exposing financial mismanagement at the
foundation prompted the attorney general to file a civil suit to
try to remove the board of directors, and led state officials to
take a more active role in revitalizing the landmark theater.

A CRUCIAL DEBATE ON KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, April 13: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the air war over Yugoslavia heads toward its fourth week,
pressure is building on President Clinton to send ground forces
into battle. Sen. John McCain and other critics of the NATO
campaign are right to open a national debate about military and
diplomatic options, and the planning for all contingencies should
begin. But there should be no illusions about the difficulties and
potential costs of a land war. A great deal more bombing and
diplomacy should be employed before Clinton and the nation make any
fateful decisions about the use of ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   Though the air war has progressed slowly, and has done little to
impede the Serbian march across Kosovo, it is inflicting heavy
damage on Serbia's military and industrial base. Given time, the
attacks can wear down Slobodan Milosevic's resistance and make his
people impatient to end the bombing. It is certainly premature to
conclude that air strikes are not enough and only an invasion can
secure NATO's political and military goals. Milosevic well knows
that the steady destruction of oil refineries, weapons factories,
ammunition supplies and communication networks will eventually
cripple his military forces, and possibly undermine his political
power. Even McCain, who is pushing hard for the use of ground
troops, acknowledges that bombing ought to be given more time.
</P>
<P>
   As painful as the air war may sometimes be in Serbia _ Monday a
NATO missile severed a rail bridge, killing at least eight people
as a passing train was knocked into a river _ NATO must sustain the
attacks. Unlike the Serbian assault on Kosovo, the alliance is not
deliberately targeting civilians. NATO's 19 members agreed Monday
to continue the aerial bombardment, a sign of unity and
determination that Milosevic should consider carefully as he tries
to sow division within the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomacy also needs time to work. Kofi Annan, the Secretary
General of the United Nations, is getting involved, a step the
Clinton administration properly welcomed Monday. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright plans to meet Tuesday in Oslo with Russia's
foreign minister, Igor Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
   Russia remains the best hope for mediating the conflict. Though
the war has provoked anti-Western sentiment in Russia, Moscow has
grown impatient with Milosevic's truculence in recent years and
recognizes that Russian and Serbian interests do not always
coincide. The challenge for Washington is to give the Kremlin some
diplomatic maneuvering room without undercutting NATO's aims in
Kosovo. One approach, already tacitly endorsed by NATO, would be to
include a significant contingent of Russian troops in any
international peacekeeping force sent to Kosovo as part of a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   It would take at least six weeks, probably longer, to assemble a
ground force of 70,000 troops in the region, along with the tanks,
artillery, ammunition and other supplies needed to support an
invasion of Kosovo. A much larger force would be needed to invade
Serbia itself. Even then, an invading force might encounter fierce
resistance from Serbian forces. McCain's prediction of a quick
victory is appealing but unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   Though the use of ground troops should be the option of last
resort, planning for an invasion may give Milosevic reason to plot
a diplomatic course. To strengthen the hands of diplomats, and to
give NATO a full range of options, Clinton and his European allies
should begin to draw up the plans for a ground assault. Meanwhile,
the bombing should proceed and the nation can engage in a vigorous
debate about whether this country's vital interests will be served
by sending troops into Yugoslavia.

 SPORTS COLUMN: NOT A CHANCE OF CONFUSING THESE TEAMS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The first ball was thrown out by a man who, unlike
last week's returning hero, buried his hatchet years ago. Tom
Seaver captured the poignancy of his Shea Stadium moment when he
turned to Bobby Jones, the Mets' starting pitcher, and said, ``Who
would have thought that two guys from Fresno would have been
standing out on the mound on opening day?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I laughed,'' Jones said dryly, obviously overcome by Seaver's
cosmic disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   From one home opener to another, the Mets' was windblown family
entertainment to the Yankees' quixotic, theatrical drama. In the
Bronx last Friday, George Steinbrenner's team had Yogi Berra to
assume his rightful role as the greatest living Yankee, Joe Torre
to receive prayers and Joe DiMaggio to be mourned. The Mets of Fred
Wilpon and Nelson Doubleday had Seaver to bounce his first pitch to
the injured Mike Piazza, Buddy Harrelson to stop by the press box
and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to fake being their fan.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees raised another championship flag. The Mets put Rick
Reed, their No. 2 starter, on the disabled list. The Yankees played
under an appropriately somber sky, in a persistent, divine rain. On
an otherwise cheerful afternoon, the Mets were sent fleeing from
their clubhouse by a burst water pipe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they didn't spend too much on the renovation,'' said
Bobby Bonilla, who had three breakout hits in his return to New
York and still had to deal with a postgame stink.
</P>
<P>
   ``They,'' meaning ownership, didn't spend as much as was
sacrificed on the lineup's redecoration. The Mets did beat the
five-and-dime Florida Marlins, but you could argue that the day's
most compelling human interest was the appearance of a Yankee,
Orlando Hernandez. El Duque sat in a box behind home plate, where
he watched Livan _ his half-brother, who preceded him out of Cuba
and into the World Series by a full season _ inspire no notions of
perfection in the four and two-thirds innings it took for him to
help the Mets to a 5-1 lead on the way to an 8-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   This potential tear-jerker of a tale died when Livan was run
from the mound and El Duque quickly departed the park. For the
record, Mets manager Bobby Valentine said he was deeply moved when
his pinch-hitter, the rookie Mike Kinkade, doubled in the eighth
inning for his two first major league runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   By then, everyone was smiling in the Mets' dugout, if not in the
clubhouse, because other than the news of Reed's slight tear to his
calf muscle and a couple of balls that blew over Rickey Henderson's
head, opening day was a showcase for the Mets, those old (Bonilla),
new (Robin Ventura, who had a two-run double and excelled
defensively at third), borrowed (Henderson, who stole his first
Shea base as a Met and even caught a ball in left) and blue
(Valentine, whose office took the brunt of the sixth-inning flood).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all so nice and new and pristine,'' Valentine sighed.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it. The Mets were just not going to open like the
Yankees, and it's doubtful they have the capability to close like
the defending World Series champions, either. On a more optimistic
note, if New York is going to be treated to a competitive baseball
summer, it is far more likely to occur in Queens, where the Mets
could finally make a run at the Braves for their division and
should be no worse off than right in the middle of the wild-card
chase.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza is already on the disabled list for a couple of weeks,
but, no problem, the early competition has been the Marlins and
Montreal Expos, teams whose combined payrolls (roughly $36 million)
are slightly more than half of the Mets' $63.5 million. Then there
is Bonilla, purporting to be the wise old hand who has endured
through the capriciousness of four New York summers, who has
returned to advise those who have not so endured to block out the
noise (though not by literally plugging up their ears).
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're going pretty good, they'll cheer you on,'' Bonilla
said. ``When you're going pretty bad, they'll get all over you. I
understand it. I'm trying to convince the other guys of that.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first tour in town, Bonilla began with a smile that soon
turned sour. He tried to carry a load that he could not. He once
threatened a reporter by telling him, ``I'll show you the Bronx,''
his home borough. The Bronx may have tough neighborhoods, but it
also happens to be where baseball begins with pathos and panache.
Shea is where tender moments are few and they are drowned out by
ascending jets and bursting pipes. At least it's not Fresno.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Outside the Puck Building in SoHo last week, a couple
of photographers were lolling around when one, an old guy with the
alert expression of a trauma nurse, spied a young woman coming
through the downtown crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly he was alive, crouching low to snap her leather sandals
and then rising to capture the full bohemian length of her: the
long gray dress made of sweatshirt fabric, the old Levi's jacket
with its sleeves hacked off, the blond hair wound around a piece of
wood _ a twig _ with a clump of knotted leather streaming down her
back like a jungle vine.
</P>
<P>
   She looked utterly oblivious of the man. But he was in heaven.
At last! Something novel to photograph.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Puck Building, it was a different story. South of
Seventh, the alternative fashion camp that sprang up last year to
promote budding talent, was showing the fall collections of 30
designers.
</P>
<P>
   That the presentation came six weeks after the major New York
shows ended was only part of the problem. With the exception of
Geoffrey Beene and Joan Vass, Seventh Avenue veterans who had
chosen not to show in February, and Russell Simmons' Phat Farm
label, the names during the three days of shows, which ended
Friday, were scarcely recognizable.
</P>
<P>
   Who were Joseph Israel, Elena Bajo, Eduardo Lucero and Ann
Hitchcock? Who was anybody?
</P>
<P>
   The South of Seventh organizers had obviously gone to a great
deal of trouble to create a hip atmosphere in which to coax
interest, and ultimately sales, out of store buyers and editors.
There was a lounge area with modern sofas, and a couple of bars
selling sandwiches and cappuccino.
</P>
<P>
   But by late Wednesday _ after Israel's ``She Blinded Me With
Science'' collection, with its uninspired nylon cutout skirts, and
Carla Westcott's rhinestone cowboy revue, in which she handed out
sacks of Southern snack food, including Big Mama pickled sausages _
it seemed clear the organizers had overestimated the audience's
good will.
</P>
<P>
   After all, many in this crowd had just come off nearly a month
of European shows. They had seen some wildly inventive clothes from
designers in weird places, showing without sponsorship, and
certainly without cappuccino. And with New York crawling with young
talent, the fashion pros would hardly feel benevolent just because
the designers were earnestly struggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point in the game they have to be extraordinary,''
said Julie Gilhart, the vice president for fashion merchandising at
Barneys New York, as she waited between shows. ``Because, by now,
we've seen everything.''
</P>
<P>
   With a handful of exceptions, the clothes were much less
individual than what was going on in the streets. Outside, the
young women looked serenely unencumbered by fashion. They had on
T-shirts, sexy little trousers, things that looked homemade.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, Fiona Walker showed some delightful hand-knit sweaters,
with loopy fringe, and Margie Tsai casually mixed structured
clothes, like a pony jacket over jersey separates. Yet one couldn't
help feeling that they were designing in a vacuum and that these
clothes had more in common with a design school exercise than with
what flesh-and-blood women were wearing.
</P>
<P>
   Once Gabriella Zanzani's show settled down, there were signs of
strong tailoring _ and good eye for detail _ but her attempts to
manipulate her silhouette by bunching and crimping the fabrics
looked pointless.
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo Lucero is one who obviously does know his customers. His
clothes display a hard, sexy drive, with just a dash of vulgarity,
which has brought him a following in Los Angeles. (Drew Barrymore
wore one of his dresses to the Oscars last month.) Working in a
subdued palette of olive, burgundy, brown and black, Lucero uses
sharp tailoring to convey his modern message. Pantsuits, some in
shimmering pinstripes, snuggle over loose, asymmetrical tops or
shells. Lucero's clothes don't immediately suggest an identifiable
style, leaving his customers room to inject their own.
</P>
<P>
   Elena Bajo opened her show with a couple of nude dancers and a
pair of artists nonchalantly painting their canvases in the
background. Predictably, the naked dancers _ ``nekkid,'' as Big
Mama the sausage queen might say _ produced snickers.
</P>
<P>
   While the artists dabbed away at their paintings (one of them
looked like an abstract shark), models cavorted in Ms. Bajo's airy
knits, which wrapped and draped around the body. And though it was
distracting to look at so many unclothed bodies _ at one point four
men and women, all naked, were doing a kind of maypole dance around
a guy holding a candle _ Ms. Bajo's clothes artfully evoked a
similar freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, after Ms. Bajo's show, one of the young models appeared
in a black halter top with strands of leather across the back and a
cotton wrap skirt. When asked who designed her skirt, the girl
looked bored and replied snippily, ``I made it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ann Hitchcock made her clothes, too, using an old Singer sewing
machine, four ancient dress forms and a razor blade. Ms. Hitchcock,
30 and exuberant, with deep red hair, who describes her life until
recently as that of a quintessential slacker from Austin, Texas,
has almost no design training. Yet her clothes, with free-form
draping, minimal stitching and fraying edges, were the most
imaginative at the shows.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hitchcock readily admits she was influenced by
deconstruction. ``Martin Margiela, Yohji Yamamoto, Ann
Demeulemeester,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hitchcock buys remnants (``I'm a 99-cent-table girl,'' she
said) and drapes and sews them directly on a form, often leaving
the loose threads hanging. As she spoke, a buyer from Patricia
Field, the downtown boutique, approached and said she wanted to
place an order. Ms. Hitchcock's eyes popped open like Texas stars.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it would be a mistake to assume that this young creator sees
herself as anything other than a round peg in a square world. The
next day, while she slashed a piece of cotton jersey and
transformed it in minutes into a T-shirt for a model, Ms. Hitchcock
said she had no desire to ``be the next Calvin Klein.'' When it was
suggested that she might apprentice herself to one of her muses,
she vehemently shook her head.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would inhibit my style,'' she said.

ICE WON'T CHILL RACIAL COMMENTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NHL has received well-justified negative publicity on
several occasions the last couple of years for slurs by white
players against the league's few black players.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, San Jose's Bryan Marchment called Vancouver's
Donald Brashear, who is black, ``a big monkey.'' Marchment admitted
making the remark, apologized, said he calls all large opponents
``big monkeys'' regardless of race, and served a one-game
suspension.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of this episode of epic ignorance, there was a
broadcast report last week that the NHL was concerned about another
form of on-ice ethnocentrism: English Canadians making derogatory
remarks to their French-Canadian countrymen.
</P>
<P>
   An NHL spokesman denied that the league was concerned, and based
on a small sampling of French-Canadian Kings, it appears
anti-French comments on the ice are fairly infrequent, though no
more defensible than slurs against any other minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have been (slurred this season), I didn't hear it,'' Luc
Robitaille said. ``But I did call a few French guys `frogs.' They
look at me like, `What the hell?' You've got to find the limit of
what you say. There's no place for racial comments. But I'd rather
have a guy yell comments at me than hit me with a stick over the
head.''
</P>
<P>
   Ian Laperriere said, ``Once in awhile, you're going to hear
`frog.' Until I know what it means, I won't get upset. I'm still
trying to figure out what it means. I know it's a green animal, a
reptile. I laugh at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Winger Donald Audette said the number of anti-French comments on
the ice has decreased in recent seasons, perhaps because of greater
overall sensitivity resulting from the presence of a growing number
of blacks and other minorities in the game the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   When he hears a derisive comment, Audette said, ``It comes
through one ear and goes out the other one. They're the ones who
look stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the players downplay the impact the remarks have on them,
the French-English issue has long been a serious one in Canada.
When he played in the NHL from 1966-67 to 1981-82, Kings vice
president Rogie Vachon said comments were fairly frequent.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he dealt with it, Vachon said, ``You'd concentrate on
the game, and besides, I played with a lot of big French-Canadian
players. I just had to tell one of my French-Canadian defensemen
what was said, and they took care of business. . . . There's no
room for that. We're going into the 2000th century. Everybody
should be above that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   __ World Wide Web: Obviously not realizing the comments could
come back to haunt him, Pittsburgh's Jaromir Jagr criticized coach
Kevin Constantine in a recent interview with the Czech newspaper MF
Dnes. Jagr's quotes subsequently popped up, translated into
English, on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the way (Constantine) prepares the team and I'm
not the only one among the players,'' Jagr told the Prague-based
daily. ``His communication with us is just awful. Either he yells
at us or he just hides somewhere. Right now, it's just impossible
to talk to him.''
</P>
<P>
   When a Pittsburgh writer told Jagr he'd seen the quote, the
NHL's leading scorer reacted with surprise and embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Constantine's reaction?
</P>
<P>
   ``Those (comments) are water under the bridge as far as I'm
concerned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Angry Oilers:The Edmonton Oilers were fuming when Colorado
goalie Patrick Roy twice tried to shoot the puck into an empty net
in the final minute of a recent victory by the Avalanche. What
upset them was that Roy skated far out of his net into the corner
to chase a loose puck with a two-goal lead, all so he could bid for
the first goal of his 14-year career.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wants to be a forward,'' coach Ron Low asked, ``why
shouldn't we be able to hit him?''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant coach Ted Green added, ``He's got an ego bigger than
the Goodyear blimp.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Cutting Edge: Calgary defenseman Steve Smith probably wonders
why he came out of retirement this year.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 35, was injured last week when the skate blade of Toronto
forward Ladislav Kohn sliced open the side of his throat, narrowly
missing his jugular vein. Kohn's skate severed a nerve in Smith's
neck, causing him to lose all feeling on the right side of his
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a plastic surgeon do some microsurgery on the
nerves,'' Smith said calmly. ``The whole side of my head, I can't
feel. They said it would be a year before the feeling would return.
I can't feel my ear. I can't feel anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith wanted to play six nights later but was told he'd risk
permanent loss of feeling if he was re-injured. &QL;

   __ MR. ZERO: Former King Byron Dafoe last week became the first
Boston Bruins goalie with 10 or more shutouts in a season when he
blanked the Montreal Canadiens. Since the NHL began its era of

<P>
   GRDELICA, Yugoslavia _ No one knew the names of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   They were not locals, just strangers passing through on the
Belgrade to Skopje train, No. 393, at about 11:45 Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   They were unlucky, it seems, to be in this particularly
spectacular gorge, on this particular bridge, in this particular
train, at this particular time, when death dropped down unseen from
a cloudy sky.
</P>
<P>
   In its expanding air war, NATO planes Monday morning bombed two
bridges _ one highway, one railway _ over the Juzna Morava River.
The train, five cars pulled by a bright red, white and blue engine,
was on the railway bridge, a narrow structure of steel girders
painted a dull gray. The missile cut the train in half.
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 people were killed, said police at the scene, and at
least 16 others, badly injured, were brought to a hospital in
nearby Leskovac. At least two planes were heard, according to a
police sergeant who would not give his name, but they could not be
seen. He said that the bridge was hit and then the train itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bastards attacked the train,'' he said through an
interpreter. ``Now go away. I don't want to hear English anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said in Brussels Monday that the alliance had
targeted the bridges here, some 190 miles south of Belgrade, on
what it considers an important supply route into Kosovo. But the
deaths they put down to another accident of war.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no intent to hit the train,'' said NATO spokesman
Jamie Shea. ``Regrettably, we cannot exclude the possibility of
casualties in this instance.''
</P>
<P>
   The casualties were not hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   Three railway cars were incinerated, still hot and smoking three
hours later, when the first journalists arrived.
</P>
<P>
   On the grassy verge next to the tracks, close to a small plowed
field turning green and a street of damaged houses, nine charred
and broken corpses lay heaped by a small tree. Their clothes had
been blown or burned away.
</P>
<P>
   Police and army officers had begun to arrive in groups to direct
traffic, get the earthmovers working on a makeshift detour around
the holed highway bridge and to keep the curious away.
</P>
<P>
   Three men wearing transparent plastic gloves walked up to the
grassy verge with a cheap coffin, pale knotty wood on the inside,
the outside stained a not very convincing darker brown.
</P>
<P>
   One man, in blue overalls, picked up a female torso, from the
neck to the buttocks, and placed it into the coffin. He then bent
down and lightly tossed a blackened arm into the coffin, picking up
his head to stare at the smoldering cars, the rushing river below
and the steep hills, dotted with spring greenery and flowering
fruit trees.
</P>
<P>
   The smell of spring was strong, lush and damp, quickly overtaken
by that of burning oil, rubber and electrical wire. Then, like the
top note of a perfume, the melancholy, sweet, cloying smell of
burned human flesh.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our life now _ spring and death,'' said Nenad Pezo, the
Yugoslav army minder who had allowed a car of journalists to make a
detour and come here.
</P>
<P>
   A man watching from the road at first refused to talk. Then he
began to throw words like stones. ``Another atrocity,'' he said.
``Or do the NATO criminals think atrocities are not atrocities from
the air?'' Asked his name, he spit on the ground. Goran, he said,
then turned away.
</P>
<P>
   The journalists had come from the scene of another NATO
accident, in the little Kosovo village of Merdare, near Mirovace,
about 1.5 miles northwest of Podujevo, near the provincial border
with Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   It was Kosovo, but no official here would discuss the military
situation. Any brief discussion of the condition of the ethnic
Albanians here or the tactics of the Serbian military toward them
was either bland or tendentious.
</P>
<P>
   On the road south there were numerous checkpoints, guards on
bridges and a heavy troop presence on a cloudy day, both on foot
and in trucks. But there was little armor visible. Sometimes one
could hear planes, but not see them.
</P>
<P>
   Deeper in Kosovo, where journalists are not allowed to wander,
there are continuing, consistent reports of Serb atrocities against
ethnic Albanian supporters of the Kosovo Liberation Army. But we
were brought here by the Yugoslav authorities to witness Serb
suffering.
</P>
<P>
   In Merdare, NATO bombs and anti-personnel bombs demolished four
houses early Sunday, killing five people, including Bozina Tosovic,
30, and his 11-month-old daughter, Bojana. His wife, Marija, six
months pregnant, is in the hospital, along with the four members of
the Markovic family: Dragan and his wife Natalija and their two
children, daughter Andelija and son Milos.
</P>
<P>
   Markovic's brother, Ljubomir, 42, had just arrived an hour
before from Belgrade, where he lives, and walked in shock around
the blasted houses and stables. He had heard about the attack on
television, and then the local police phoned him.
</P>
<P>
   In the collapsed remains of his brother's house, of mud brick
and wood, with what had been a red tile roof, he found the family
dog, Snoopy, a yellow mongrel, with half his snout blown away.
</P>
<P>
   Ljubomir began to sob, kneeling by the quivering dog, petting
his head, as sunlight poured through a huge hole in the roof. ``Are
you scared my doll?'' he asked. ``Are you scared, sweetheart?''
</P>
<P>
   He looked up, tears streaming. ``Should I shoot him? I can't.''
He then stood to gather some family photos blown through the rubble
of the children's bedroom, the mud and wood roof and exterior wall
collapsed on their beds. ``Can you imagine passing through this?''
he asked. A broken mirror had stamps pasted on it featuring soccer
stars, sponsored by Sony.
</P>
<P>
   He turned back to the dog, then said: ``Ten years. For 10 years
it was impossible to find two socks and two shoes together because
of that Snoopy.''

 GRDELICA: that Snoopy.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the fields, there were hundreds of small holes in the earth
from detonations, and small green nylon parachutes from what
appeared to be NATO anti-personnel bombs, covering an area of about
300 square yards. Large pieces of green painted metal, with yellow
stripes, perfectly broken open as if on a seam, lay about the yard.
There were also large pieces of formed yellow styrofoam and light
aluminium containers, with fans like whirligigs, that appeared to
have held the small parachutes, with explosives attached.
</P>
<P>
   There was one dead pig and another wounded, and shrapnel
everywhere. Trees were broken off and flung 20 yards. A child's
pillow with cartoon characters, mice and cats, lay in the mud.
</P>
<P>
   Markovic pulled at an elbow. ``The cow is dead but the calf is
alive, but he's wounded,'' he said, staring. ``Should I shoot the
calf?''
</P>
<P>
   In the ruined stable, a black and white cow lay dead across the
door. Markovic stepped on it to reach the brown calf, its tail
nearly severed and its breath labored. ``It won't move from its
mother,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He came out and appealed to a policeman, who talked softly to
him but only shrugged. ``I don't believe there is any comment on
this,'' Markovic said. ``I care more about this cow and calf and
dog than Clinton and Albright care about anyone in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Miloje Smiljkovic, described as a local detective, in plain
clothes and two days' growth of beard, pointed out the sights.
``There is no military objective here that anyone can think of,''
he said. ``Maybe they're trying to cut off Kosovo from Serbia.''
The attacks came just after midnight on Orthodox Easter Sunday, and
again at 2 a.m. and 4:25 a.m., he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also possible that the planes were going after
Yugoslav troops or a column of vehicles on the nearby road, which
might explain the use of anti-personnel munitions.
</P>
<P>
   Dragan Bubalo was another of the dead, killed in his Ford
Sierra, which was blasted off the paved road. The dark blue car,
shot through with holes from shrapnel and its hood blown 60 yards
away, had run into an earth embankment. The metal road sign marking
the village of Merdare was also full of shrapnel holes.
</P>
<P>
   On a second hill, there were three large craters, about 10 yards
deep, where there had been the house, barn, car and tractor of
Milutin Veskovic, an actor at a local theater called Zajecar, who
was not home when the bombs hit. The plastic tray of a box of
chocolates landed 150 yards away. Socks hung weirdly from the
branches of broken trees.
</P>
<P>
   His neighbor, Ognjen Bercovic, came along, an old man leaning on
a stick. ``We heard the planes, then the bombs,'' he said. ``There
was a huge light, a flash.'' Asked how his family is, he began to
cry. ``The kids are so terrified,'' he said, describing his
grandson, 2 years old, and his 15-day-old grandaughter, Marina.
``They're still shaking,'' he said, then attacked the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their bombs will not scare us,'' he shouted, still weeping.
``No man will frighten us.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Tosovic house, neighbors and some soldiers were trying to
salvage what they could: a ripped couch, a television set, plates
and glasses. A thin man, a neighbor, was asked about the family. He
became incensed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't talk to Americans or Brits,'' he said tightly. ``I
won't talk to them. I don't want to look at them. I'm sorry,'' he
said, ``but please just go away.''

ADVERTISING: AURORA AIMS TO TAKE THE HO-HUM OUT OF ITS BRANDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mo., Ohio)  (lb) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is Aurora the dawn of a new day for some venerable brands?
</P>
<P>
   The brands are the subjects of an ambitious reclamation project
by Aurora Foods Inc. of San Francisco, which was formed to
rejuvenate familiar though fading products that were pantry
mainstays when the big star named Marilyn was Monroe not Manson.
</P>
<P>
   The brands, acquired by Aurora when they were sold off, spun off
or cast off by larger marketers like Procter &AMP; Gamble, Quaker Oats
and Unilever, include Duncan Hines baking mixes, Log Cabin and Mrs.
Butterworth's syrups, Aunt Jemima and Celeste frozen foods, and
frozen-fish products under the Mrs. Paul's and Van de Kamp's names.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy is to stimulate sales by significantly increasing
the duration and budgets of advertising and promotional campaigns,
particularly through such highly visible steps as returning the
brands to television, while expanding product offerings by adding
flavors, varieties and packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are great American icon brands, like old friends,'' said
Tom Hall, chairman and chief executive officer at Ogilvy &AMP; Mather
Chicago, the agency for the Aurora syrups. ``It's amazing how
quickly they can come back to life.''
</P>
<P>
   Aurora's plans are emblematic of marketers' willingness to try
awakening tired old brands, especially in an economic boom, when
consumers will spend freely for products priced higher than store
brands or generics.
</P>
<P>
   Others embarked on similar efforts include Pepsico Inc., for the
Cracker Jack snack brand; Keebler Co., for the Sunshine and Famous
Amos lines of cookies and crackers, and Vlasic Foods International,
for grocery brands like Vlasic pickles and Swanson frozen meals.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the recession of the early 1990s has left shoppers more
skeptical than ever, determined to embrace only the brands they
deem to deliver value. Products they decide are played out or no
longer relevant will be consigned to a Madison Avenue branch of
Valhalla.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Favorite Brands International, which markets
products including marshmallows and caramels once sold under the
Kraft name, is reorganizing under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brands have life cycles,'' said Hall, whose agency is part of
the Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide unit of WPP Group PLC, ``and there
are brands whose cycles have run out.''
</P>
<P>
   In those cases, he added, a revival ``doesn't work at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Aurora executives believe their brands are ripe for
restoration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an elegantly simple formula,'' said Tony Bevilacqua,
executive vice president for sales and marketing for the VDK Frozen
Foods division of Aurora in St. Louis. ``We revitalize brands by
investing in advertising and improvements, putting products in
front of people that better meet their needs.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Mrs. Paul's and Van de Kamp's frozen seafood
brands are being broadened with baked and flavored varieties and
are being promoted with TV commercials, print ads and cents-off
coupons. There are also larger portions and larger packages of
products like Mrs. Paul's Select Cuts and Van de Kamp's Tenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to see the brands sparking to what consumers
consider value added,'' said Stacey Goldman, group account director
at Louis London Advertising and Sales Promotion in St. Louis, which
recently added advertising duties to its sales promotion
assignments for Aurora.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did a couple of store stops the other day to see the new
packaging,'' she added, ``and it was nice to see we had been
shopped.''
</P>
<P>
   The division of Aurora overseeing nonfrozen foods is working on
similar projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are products that are still very well known, just not
marketed,'' said Gary Willett, executive vice president at the
Columbus, Ohio, office of Aurora that is responsible for dry
groceries.
</P>
<P>
   ``They became noncore brands for their parents, which started to
pull advertising and stopped product initiatives,'' he added. ``Our
job is to reverse all that.''
</P>
<P>
   So for the syrups there are new flavors and new packages,
including premium-priced glass bottles for Log Cabin, aimed at
adults, and plastic squeeze bottles with drip-proof caps for Mrs.
Butterworth's, aimed at children. And ad budgets that dwindled to
virtually nothing have been increased to $5 million for 1998 and
$10 million for 1999, enabling the brands to come back onto TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tremendous legitimization through prime-time
television,'' Hall of Ogilvy Chicago said. ``It's a potent,
powerful weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   N.W. Ayer &AMP; Partners in New York, part of MacManus Group, is
using that same weapon for Duncan Hines, creating a campaign
carrying the theme ``You're why I bake.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads have shifted from a previous product-driven focus to
``connecting with the emotional feelings of baking for family,
friends and neighbors,'' said Mary Beth Casey, chief executive at
Ayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned from research that we can convince people to bake
more often,'' she added, ``and invite in people who haven't made
baking a part of their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If Aurora sees the opportunity in brands it believes had or
have strong equity that could be parlayed into stronger
presences,'' Ms. Casey said, ``we'd like to participate.''
</P>
<P>
   Aurora executives have a shopping list of ``well-established
brands that could be nurtured a little bit better,'' Willett said,
citing as an example the Cream of Wheat cereal line sold by a unit
of RJR Nabisco Holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Next on a very special episode of ``Supermarket Sweep'': nature
vs. nurture.

FROM STEINBRENNER, A TRIPLE PLAY FOR FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After 13 years of agitating about a move to Manhattan
or New Jersey, George Steinbrenner III, the principal owner of the
New York Yankees, has now publicly expressed interest in keeping
the team in the Bronx but has also extended his requests for
government investment in a new stadium to include not only the
state and the city but the federal government as well.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief comment in this week's issue of Crain's New York
Business that was expanded upon Monday by his spokesman,
Steinbrenner suggested that city, state and federal officials
develop a comprehensive plan for revitalizing the area surrounding
Yankee Stadium in the South Bronx, including improvements to
schools and transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who had strongly advocated building a
stadium for the Yankees on the West Side of Manhattan, hailed
Steinbrenner's willingness to remain in the Bronx. ``If the end
result is that the Yankees want to stay in the Bronx, that is the
best possible result for me and for the city and for everyone
else,'' Giuliani said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, who was at Shea Stadium for the New York Mets' home
opener against the Florida Marlins, portrayed Steinbrenner's change
of heart as a renewed interest in a plan by the administration to
build a new stadium and baseball ``village'' in the South Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``The model that we are talking about is a model that we
presented to him,'' said Giuliani, explaining that the city, the
state and the Yankees had contributed equally to the model's costs.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor did not mention the political opposition that had
grown around a West Side stadium from Republicans like Gov. George
Pataki and Democrats like the City Council speaker, Peter Vallone.
</P>
<P>
   Elaborating on Steinbrenner's comments, his spokesman, Howard
Rubenstein, said: ``George Steinbrenner most recently said if the
federal, state and city governments will come to him and the
Yankees with a plan to revitalize that area in the Bronx and not
just a new Yankee Stadium, he would seriously consider it. And when
he talks about revitalization, he is talking about possible retail
outlets, entertainment center, transportation, highway access, a
vast variety of things that will impact favorably on that
borough.''
</P>
<P>
   Such developments would most closely resemble a plan proposed by
the Bronx borough president, Fernando Ferrer, who has long
maintained that the Yankees should remain in their historic home.
But meeting Steinbrenner's current requests would require
substantially more planning, including the involvement of federal
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that planning has already begun. Since the fall,
Steinbrenner has been involved in discussions with Rep. Charles
Rangel, a Harlem Democrat, about the possibility of using federal
empowerment-zone statutes to transform the area around 161st
Street, where the stadium is located.
</P>
<P>
   Rubenstein said Steinbrenner was seeking not just government
money but assurances that the project could be completed. ``It has
to be a plan that demonstrates where the financing would come from
and who would be in charge of doing it,'' Rubenstein said. ``He
wants the government to be very specific on a wide-ranging basis
about the Bronx. He wants to see not only what a plan would be but
how it could and would be executed. He is concerned that if an
election comes and goes, suddenly the plan doesn't materialize.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Monday, Ferrer praised Steinbrenner's remarks.
``I think it's a very positive first step,'' he said. ``We are
getting there. It is an acknowledgment, I think, that there isn't
an economic rationale for being in New Jersey and there isn't any
political support for a West Side stadium. The mayor found that out
very dramatically last year.''
</P>
<P>
   The team's lease at Yankee Stadium, which is owned by the city,
expires in 2002. While Steinbrenner had long kept city and state
officials guessing by threatening to move the team to New Jersey,
that possibility was essentially squelched by a recent business
agreement linking the Yankees to the New Jersey Nets basketball
franchise, which is seeking money from New Jersey to build a new
arena in Newark and would not want the Yankees lobbying for state
money for a new stadium at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said Monday that a stadium project in the Bronx could
end up costing more than a stadium on the West Side. ``It makes the
most sense for the Yankees to stay in the Bronx from an emotional
standpoint, and because that's the house that Ruth built and it has
tremendous history and that alone has tremendous value,'' he said.
``It may end up costing more but it will end up having lots of
benefits.''

JUDGE HOLDS CLINTON IN CONTEMPT FOR FALSE TESTIMONY IN PAULA JONES
CASE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for inserts, rewriting throughout)  (sw) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER with NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge held President Clinton in contempt
of court on Monday, saying he had willfully provided false
testimony under oath about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky in
the sexual misconduct lawsuit filed by Paula Jones.
</P>
<P>
   In a scathing 32-page ruling, Judge Susan Webber Wright said
Clinton testified falsely in a Jan. 17, 1998, deposition that he
had not had sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky. Judge Wright, of
Federal District Court in Little Rock, Ark., said the president's
actions had subverted the rule of law and violated Mrs. Jones'
right to information relevant to her case.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has contended that his denial of a sexual relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky was ``legally accurate'' under a definition that
Judge Wright had approved. But Judge Wright said on Monday that
Clinton's admission last August of ``inappropriate'' conduct with
Ms. Lewinsky had left it beyond dispute that he gave false
testimony in his January deposition.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Wright noted that no president had ever been held in
contempt of court, but she said she found ``no constitutional
barrier'' to doing so in this case and in imposing sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court takes no pleasure whatsoever in holding this
nation's President in contempt of court,'' wrote the judge, a
onetime law student of Clinton's who was appointed to the bench by
President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   However, she said, ``The record demonstrates by clear and
convincing evidence that the President responded to plaintiffs'
questions by giving false, misleading and evasive answers that were
designed to obstruct the judicial process.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's decision came two months after Clinton was acquitted of
perjury and obstruction of justice by the Senate, but it could
still have significant effects for Clinton, costing him further
financial penalties and possibly any chance to practice law when he
leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Wright cited the president for civil contempt and ordered
him to pay ``any reasonable expenses,'' including legal fees,
incurred by Mrs. Jones as a result of Clinton's false testimony.
She gave Mrs. Jones' lawyers 20 days to submit an estimate of their
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Wright also ordered Clinton to reimburse her court $1,202,
the cost of her travel to Washington in January 1998 to preside
over the deposition in the Jones suit, which was taken in the
office of Clinton's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   And she referred the matter to the Professional Conduct
Committee of the Arkansas Supreme Court, which has the power to
revoke Clinton's license to practice law or impose other sanctions
on him. The panel hears all types of complaints against lawyers,
but is likely to take a referral from a federal judge particularly
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Wright said she tried to treat Clinton as she would any
other defendant in a civil proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that regard,'' she wrote, ``there simply is no escaping the
fact that the President deliberately violated this court's
discovery orders and thereby undermined the integrity of the
judicial system. Sanctions must be imposed, not only to redress the
President's misconduct, but to deter others who might themselves
consider emulating the President of the United States by engaging
in misconduct that undermines the integrity of the judicial
system.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House referred all questions about the ruling to
Robert S. Bennett, one of Clinton's private lawyers. Bennett's
office said he would have no comment until he had a chance to
review the judge's order.
</P>
<P>
   But a member of the president's legal team said it might not be
in the president's legal, political or financial interest to
challenge the contempt citation. To do so would involve several
months of motions and hearings that would keep the matter alive in
the news media and cost thousands of dollars in additional legal
fees. But the president and his advisers have not yet decided what
to do, the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   John W. Whitehead, one of several lawyers who represented Mrs.
Jones last year, said he could not give an accurate estimate of the
cost of Clinton's false testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to do an accounting,'' Whitehead said. ``We have to
look at everything that occurred after Jan. 17 and see if it can be
attributed to the president's answers that day.'' He said the
figure would likely be in the ``tens of thousands of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jones sued Clinton in 1994, claiming that he had made a
crude sexual advance in a Little Rock hotel room when he was
governor of Arkansas and she was a low-level state employee.
Clinton denied the accusations and sought to have the case quashed,
but the Supreme Court in 1997 unanimously ruled that the president
was subject to civil litigation even in office.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Wright dismissed Mrs. Jones's lawsuit last April, saying
that the President's behavior, while boorish if proven, did not
meet the standard of sexual harassment under federal law. Mrs.
Jones appealed; in November, Clinton resolved her claim with an
out-of-court settlement and a payment of $850,000.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As the Jones case was winding down, the criminal investigation
of the president was moving forward. On Aug. 17, Clinton appeared
by videotape before a federal grand jury and admitted that he had
had a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky over a 21-month period
from late 1995 through early 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president directly contradicted his deposition testimony
by acknowledging `inappropriate intimate contact' with Ms. Lewinsky
on numerous occasions,'' Judge Wright said in Monday's order,
referring to his grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said that she first learned that Clinton had given
false testimony in the Jones suit when Clinton went on television
that night to admit to having given ``misleading'' answers to Ms.
Jones' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was during the president's televised address that the Court
first learned the President may be in contempt,'' Judge Wright
said.
</P>
<P>
   She revealed that she was considering citing Clinton for
contempt in a footnote to an order last September. She waited until
now to act, she said on Monday, because she did not want to
interfere with the continuing criminal investigation and the
congressional impeachment inquiry and trial.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Wright ruled on Monday that Clinton testified falsely in
January of last year when he said that he did not recall being
alone with Ms. Lewinsky and denied having had a sexual relationship
with her. The judge said those statements were demonstrably false
and had denied Mrs. Jones the right to information that might have
supported her sexual harassment claim.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton countered that he had not touched Ms. Lewinsky in ways
that amounted to sex under the definition used in the case, and
therefore his testimony was ``legally accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   The House of Representatives in December impeached Clinton on
two counts, perjury before the federal grand jury in August and
obstruction of justice. Members voted not to cite him for false
statements in the Jones lawsuit, in part because the case had been
dismissed by Judge Wright eight months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate acquitted Clinton on both charges in February.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's ruling, Judge Wright made several references to
other ``contumacious'' conduct by the president, which she said she
chose not to address in the interest of bringing the matter to a
reasonably swift conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   She specifically cited Clinton's violation of her order not to
discuss his deposition testimony with anyone outside his legal
team. She noted that a day after giving testimony, Clinton summoned
his private secretary, Betty Currie, to the White House to review
his testimony with her. Judge Wright noted that others had violated
her confidentiality order as well.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also said that she had not addressed other conduct by
the president because it was under investigation by Kenneth Starr,
the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Wright said she found the president in contempt without
holding extensive hearings because she limited her order to facts
that were not in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has essentially admitted that he intended to
mislead plaintiff in her efforts at gaining information deemed by
this Court to be relevant,'' the judge wrote, ``and hearings would
not assist the Court in addressing the President's misconduct
regarding his failure to obey this Court's discovery orders.''

<P>
   PHOENIX _ Arizona's Randy Johnson vs. the Dodgers' Kevin Brown
was an intriguing opening-day matchup, but rain KO'd Thursday's
proposed rematch.
</P>
<P>
   However, Dodgers manager Davey Johnson's decision to push back
his starters a day _ thanks to Sunday's rainout against Colorado _
presented a pair of equally interesting matchups.
</P>
<P>
   Chan Ho Park, accused by Arizona players of throwing at Matt
Williams last week, got to pitch against the Diamondbacks on Monday
at Bank One Ballpark. This means Dodgers right-hander Kevin Brown's
next start will come Friday in San Diego, against the team he led
to the World Series six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, Brown didn't seem to care either way. He said he'll
discard the emotion of facing the Padres and returning to the city
in which he helped rejuvenate baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just another game,'' said Brown, who was asked whether
he'll be jeered or cheered in San Diego. ``I have no idea. It can't
affect me one way or the other. I can't worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Davey Johnson pushed his starters back a day,
right-hander Darren Dreifort will oppose Randy Johnson in
Thursday's series finale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally there would be somebody you want to bump, but this
isn't a normal rotation,'' Davey Johnson said . ``I'm going to do
everything I can to keep things in a normal rotation.''
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson did say he would most likely bump pitchers when the
Dodgers are off April 22 and 26.
</P>
<P>
   __ Cadaret free: Time lapsed and no one called the Dodgers for
pitcher Greg Cadaret, meaning the left-hander is a free agent. The
club gave Cadaret his unconditional release Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he will be paid for it. The Dodgers, who designated
Cadaret for assignment last Sunday, signed the veteran to a
guaranteed $375,000 contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called that an early-winter insurance policy to make sure
we had plenty of left-handers for Davey to chose from,'' general
manager Kevin Malone said. ``Who would have thought (Onan) Masaoka
would have earned a spot?''
</P>
<P>
   Cadaret thinks he can pitch in the big leagues so he refused the
Dodgers' minor-league assignment. But Cadaret's agent, Barry
Meister, said there haven't been any takers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really just started reviewing his options,'' Meister said.
``We're just trying to get a sense of who's interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Dodgers unconditionally released minor-league pitcher
Arnold Gooch, who was acquired in the Todd Hundley trade.
</P>
<P>
   __ Mondesi honored: Dodgers right fielder Raul Mondesi was named
the National League Player of the Week for the period April 4-11.
Mondesi hit four homers and drove in 10 runs while batting .381 and
having a .500 on-base percentage. Each of Mondesi's homers either
tied the game or gave the Dodgers the lead.
</P>
<P>
   __ Quick hitters . . . and pitchers: Former Milwaukee Brewer and
Hall of Famer-to-be Robin Yount threw out the first pitch for the
Diamondbacks' home opener, and he threw it right over the backstop
_ albeit on purpose. Nobody came out to catch the ceremonial pitch.
. . . Arizona activated right fielder Tony Womack (broken wrist)
before the game and he made an immediate impact. He robbed Devon
White of a homer in the top of the first inning. . . . In their
second season, the Diamondbacks didn't sell out the opener until
Monday morning. . . . The Dodgers' sported ``Los Angeles'' across
their uniforms for the first time since 1970.

   In its series ``Deadly Force,'' The Post concluded that District
of Columbia officers shot and killed more people per resident than
any other large city police force.
</P>
<P>
   A Post reporter suspected that the FBI collected but did not
disclose police-shooting data. Through repeated requests under the
Freedom of Information Act, the Post's computer-assisted reporting
team got the data and then analyzed it. Then reporters reviewed
previous homicides, talked to the police and prosecutors and at one
point test-fired police handguns.
</P>
<P>
   The Post concluded that shootings were so numerous because of
poor police training, hair-trigger handguns and questionable
tactics, like shooting at moving cars.

   The Apollo Theater on 125th Street in Harlem may once have been
``where stars are born and legends are made,'' as its motto avers.
But more recently, the historic theater has been in decay, as
editorial writers from The Daily News discovered during a visit in
March 1998, said Michael Goodwin, editor of the editorial page.
</P>
<P>
   The News' editorial board began a campaign to rescue the
theater, which is now owned by the state and run by a foundation. A
series of editorials exposing financial mismanagement at the
foundation prompted the attorney general to file a civil suit to
try to remove the board of directors, and led state officials to
take a more active role in revitalizing the landmark theater.

EDITORIAL: THE MESSAGES FROM LITTLE ROCK

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, April 13:
</P>
<P>
   Monday's decision by U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright
holding President Clinton in contempt of court was a fitting
judicial response to what she termed his ``false, misleading and
evasive'' testimony about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky in
the Paula Jones sexual harassment case. The 32-page ruling puts
into the legal and historical record that Clinton was untruthful
and deliberately misleading, and assigns a legal sanction to uphold
the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   But the financial penalties _ calling for the president to
reimburse the court $1,202 to cover the expenses incurred by the
judge in traveling to Washington to preside over ``his tainted
deposition'' and to pay Mrs. Jones any expenses incurred because of
Clinton's untruthful behavior _ are appropriately symbolic. The
president would be wise not to challenge them. The judge has
signaled her desire to bring this matter to a close.
</P>
<P>
   If the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, is smart, he will
follow Judge Wright's impulse and draw the same lesson from the
jury verdict in Little Rock on Monday. The jury acquitted Susan
McDougal on charges that she obstructed Starr's Whitewater
investigation even though there was no question she had refused to
testify before a grand jury and had disobeyed a court order to do
so. Mrs. McDougal won her case by putting the tactics of Starr and
his deputies on trial.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict should send a message to Starr that it is time to
bring his inquiries to a close. He should renounce any plans to
pursue a retrial of Mrs. McDougal on two criminal contempt charges
on which the jury deadlocked, and should expedite his final reports
to the court. His investigation has reached a point of diminishing
returns.

A MOUNTAIN OF TROUBLE FOR HILL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Ken Hill is a confused pitcher right now.
</P>
<P>
   Hill had his second consecutive poor start Monday, giving up
five runs and five hits. But most telling was his seven walks in
only four-plus innings.
</P>
<P>
   That the Angels offense came up big in a 13-5 win didn't make
Hill forget that he's got some work to do. He was so confused on
the mound Monday that in the fourth and fifth innings, he tried
going back to his old windup, something he abandoned last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was searching, trying to find something, find some rhythm,''
he said. ``Right now I'm (messed) up in terms of mechanics. I'm
worried about doing this, doing that. Until I get comfortable, I've
got to find a way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had taken an 8-3 lead in the top of the fifth, and in
the bottom of the inning Hill faced Rafael Palmeiro, who walked on
four pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to let him hit the ball,'' Hill said. ``Basically
I was trying to lay it right in there and I couldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ A no-show: The visiting clubhouse had a cubicle set up for
center fielder Jim Edmonds. His uniform was there, his shoes, cap
and batting gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Only there was no Jim Edmonds.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he expected Edmonds to show up sometime during the
four-game series against the Rangers to take batting practice and
be ready to join the lineup Wednesday in Oakland when he's eligible
to come off the disabled list. Now, Collins doesn't know what to
think.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's coming,'' Collins said, ``because I haven't
been told. I have no idea (when Edmonds will be activated).''
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds is on the DL with a strained groin and a cyst in his
right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   __ Behind the plate: Todd Greene got his first start at catcher
in a major-league game since Aug. 20, 1997. Shoulder problems had
kept him out, but he got a chance to test it early in Monday's
game.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' Tom Goodwin, one of the best basestealers in the
game, led off the first inning with a walk and tried to steal
second. Greene's throw sailed into center field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball just slipped,'' Greene said. ``I did that two or
three times in spring training because I was trying to be too quick
and I didn't get a good grip on the ball. I was laughing. Maybe
I'll make one of those blooper videos.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene said he threw the ball despite not having a good grip on
it because he didn't want anyone to think he was afraid to throw it
and test his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Greene caught six innings and was replaced by Charlie O'Brien to
start the seventh. No other Rangers baserunner tried to steal.

PENTAGON PLANS TO ADD 300 PLANES TO BATTLE YUGOSLAVIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: LEADS with 4 grafs to refocus on probability of Pentagon
approving more planes, reserves being called up; ADDS details on
deployment of added planes, background throughout; trims material
from bottom; story now in two takes.) 
 (ac) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon plans to approve the deployment of 300
additional warplanes in the fight against Yugoslavia, deepening
American involvement so significantly that President Clinton will
almost certainly have to call up reserves for the first time,
senior officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The added planes, which were requested by NATO's supreme
commander, Gen. Wesley K. Clark, would increase the number of
American and NATO aircraft committed to the campaign to nearly
1,000. That is more than double the number _430 _ that the alliance
had on hand when it began the strikes on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's request would increase the American contribution by 60
percent, from nearly 500 to 800.
</P>
<P>
   With the expansion, the Air Force would need to rely on
reservists to provide crews for the aircraft, particularly the
aerial refuelers, a senior defense official said. Until now, the
only reservists involved in the campaign are those who volunteered.
</P>
<P>
   Although Pentagon and NATO officials have portrayed the raids on
Yugoslavia as successful, despite foul weather, the rapid buildup
underscores the limits of their effects on Yugoslavia's forces.
With the Clinton administration and NATO still adamantly ruling out
the use of ground forces, Clark's sole option is to intensify air
power.
</P>
<P>
   And as the air campaign moves into its third week, NATO
commanders have expressed their frustration at the Serbian military
force's entrenched, elusive positions. In recent days, NATO and
Pentagon officials have tried to prepare the public for several
weeks more of air strikes, a campaign that military officials
insist can cripple the Serb military over a sustained period of
time. In Brussels Monday, at the first gathering of NATO foreign
ministers since the bombing began, they pledged to keep up the air
attacks but at the same time searched for the shape of a political
settlement in Kosovo and urged Russia to be part of it.
</P>
<P>
   Clark made his request two days after the Pentagon announced
that it had approved an earlier request for 82 more planes,
including F-16's, which are designed to destroyed air-defenses, and
refuelers. The officials declined to provide a full breakdown of
the numbers and types of aircraft in his latest request but said
they included both combat and support planes, including F-15's and
A-10's designed to go after targets on the ground and still more
refuelers. The United States had already committed about 10 percent
of its fighter force to the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to focus more heavily on the Yugoslav army and
special police forces on a 24-hour basis,'' the senior defense
official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon needs to work out many details about the added
planes, including where to base them. Bases in Italy, from which
most of the strikes are being carried out, are increasingly
overcrowded. NATO is considering bases in other countries,
including the Czech Republic, France, Germany and Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   The planes requested last week are just starting to be moved
overseas. If approved, the roughly 300 aircraft could be under
Clark's command in a week.
</P>
<P>
   Although clouds have again hampered strikes, NATO carried out
new air raids Monday night, striking refineries in the city of Novi
Sad in northeast Serbia and at Pancevo, not far from the capital,
Belgrade, according to the Yugoslav news agency. There were also
reports of explosions in Pristina, the provincial capital of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As they have in response to recent strikes, Yugoslav air
defenses mounted an intensifying challenge to aircraft, although
NATO has not lost a warplane since an F-117 stealth fighter was
shot down more than two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen said Monday that NATO
aircraft had achieved ``tactical maneuverability'' over Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This allows us to fly where we want and when we want with
acceptable risk,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   The weakening of Yugoslav air defenses is what has enabled Clark
to envision widening the strikes, the officials said. Clark
signaled his plans last week in an interview at NATO's military
headquarters in Mons, Belgium, saying Yugoslavia remained a potent
enemy with ``many, many targets'' still to be hit.
</P>
<P>
   A third of the additional aircraft are aerial tankers, KC-10's
and KC-135's. During the strikes, the tankers have flown in loops
over the Adriatic Sea, allowing the fighter and attack jets to dart
into Yugoslavia, return to refuel and then return for more strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some recent days of foul weather, the number of combat
missions flown each night _ or what military officials call
``strike packages'' _ has steadily increased over the last week.
There are now as many as nine a night, from an average of four or
five, the senior defense official said.
</P>
<P>
   The increase is clearly intended to have a psychological effect,
as well as a military one, signaling NATO's resolve to inflict
still more damage even as efforts to find a diplomatic solution
begin.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and other NATO powers are increasing other
forces on the ground around Yugoslavia. Pentagon officials said
Monday that 4,800 Army soldiers are now expected to accompany the
two dozen Apache helicopter gunships to Albania.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon had initially said the Apaches would be accompanied
by only 2,000 troops. A senior Army official said the growing
number of troops reflected concerns about security in northern
Albania, which is close to the Yugoslav border, as well as the
difficulty of creating a base for the helicopters in Albania, which
is Europe's least developed country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going into Albania, the middle of nowhere, with no
infrastructure,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid growth in the force that will accompany the Apache
helicopters has also contributed to their slow deployment. A week
after NATO approved their use, officials have said it could take a
month before the full force is ready to strike, though Monday they
said at least some helicopters could be ready within the next seven
to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Britain is also expected to announce that it plans to send
another 2,000 to 3,000 troops _ along with 20 tanks and 50 armored
personnel carriers _ to the NATO force it leads in Macedonia, a
NATO diplomat said. That force, originally the vanguard of a
planned peacekeeping force in Kosovo, now totals about 12,000
troops. Most of them are involved in providing aid to the thousands
of Albanians driven from their villages in Kosovo by the campaign
of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's armed forces have heavily fortified their positions
throughout Kosovo, according to NATO and Pentagon officials, and
this is complicating efforts to destroy tanks and other armored
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Aerial photographs have confirmed reports from refugees fleeing
Kosovo that Yugoslav forces are laying mines along Kosovo's
borders, digging trenches and building bunkers, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States and NATO continue to rule out the use
of ground forces against Yugoslavia, the fortification suggested
that the military and armed police forces in Kosovo have shifted
their tactics from a campaign to drive Kosovo Albanians from their
homes to a consolidation of their gains as NATO has pressed its air
and missile strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen various signs of hunkering down,'' a Defense
official said. ``There's been new mining. There are new bunkers.''
</P>
<P>
   Another American official with access to intelligence reports
said the Yugoslav Army had dug in along both major routes into the
country from Macedonia, apparently in preparation for an invasion
from NATO troops. The entrenchment of forces was reported on the
road from the Macedonian capital, Skopje, into Kosovo and on the
road from Macedonia to Nis, which is in Serbia proper.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon also released aerial photographs showing armored
vehicles parked in the middle of two villages, Malisevo and
Volujak, a tactic that the Yugoslav Army appears to have been using
to shield its forces from attacks by NATO forces wary of causing
large numbers of civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The deputy director of strategic plans and policy for the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, Maj. Gen. Charles F. Wald, said NATO had struck 24
targets over the previous two days, far less than the number
attacked when the skies over the Balkans were clear.

GIULIANI TAKES ANOTHER STEP TOWARD A RACE FOR THE SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani set up a committee Monday to
finance a possible run for the Senate next year, as aides to
Hillary Rodham Clinton, also a potential candidate for the seat,
announced that she would spend three days traveling New York next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's decision to register a reconfigured Friends of
Giuliani Committee with the Federal Elections Commission, with the
express purpose of raising money for a Senate race, was the latest
indication that the Republican mayor is now close to a decision on
his next political move. He is barred from seeking re-election
after his term expires in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Mrs. Clinton's visit to New York was presented by
her aides as the routine business of a first lady, rather than a
concerted effort to stoke interest in her potential candidacy.
``It's all the kinds of things that she's been doing all along as
first lady,'' said the first lady's press secretary, Marsha Berry.
``She's not a candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mrs. Clinton's trip has all the hallmarks of a New York
campaign swing. Her schedule is packed with appearances before
environmental groups, teachers, Jewish leaders and women, and
includes stops on Long Island and in Niagara Falls, on New York's
western edge. Its scope seems likely to inspire another round of
attention to the first lady's potential ambition to succeed Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the Democrat who is retiring in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has until now left open the possibility that he might
be interested in being considered for vice president, or in running
for governor. But his filing with the FEC offered the clearest sign
to date of which way he is leaning.
</P>
<P>
   From a technical point of view, said Bruce Teitelbaum, who is
overseeing Giuliani's political efforts, the change allows him to
collect $2,000 per person, rather than $1,000. From a political
point of view, it allowed the mayor to clarify his intentions
further.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a formal statement by the mayor that should he run for
federal office, he has now identified the office he would seek,''
Teitelbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican who has said he may be interested in seeking
the Republican nomination, Rep. Rick Lazio of Long Island, signaled
that he intended to stay in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the third time since December, I spent a week traveling
through upstate New York,'' he said. ``The feedback was
overwhelmingly positive, and leads me to believe that I'm the best
person to serve the state of New York in the U.S. Senate.''

BLASS AND BEENE: TWAIN THAT DON'T MEET 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CATHY HORYN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bill Blass and Geoffrey Beene are in a league by
themselves, but that doesn't mean they think alike, or even get
along.
</P>
<P>
   The day before his show last Wednesday at Le Cirque 2000, Blass
was in his Seventh Avenue office. He was in a jovial mood and, at
77, he appears to have lost none of his charm. When a reporter
suggested that something looked ``cool,'' he growled: ```Cool' is
out, babe. Didn't you read that in The New Yorker? `Round' is in.''
(Earlier that day, he had told Blaine Trump she ought to get with
it and buy a sweater that showed her navel.)
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``You can write anything you want about the collection,
I don't care. You can be as candid as you want.'' Blass broke into
a grin, which was followed by a huge laugh. ``And if you want to be
candid about Geoffrey Beene, I won't care about that, either.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a reference to an old feud, best left unstoked. Suffice
it to say that Blass was in top form with his fall collection,
which he said was based on ``client clothes.'' That meant drop-dead
simple luxury: a loden suit with a jacket trimmed at one corner in
velvet; a waffle-knit cardigan in creamy cashmere with smoke velvet
trousers; an all-American peacoat, but now in black corduroy and
worn for evening with beaded silk pants, and a perfectly snooty
suit in pale satin embroidered with noisy flowers.
</P>
<P>
   The colors were autumnal, but nothing like an Indiana pumpkin
patch: brown mixed with pale blue, reds with dusky orange. There
was even a mustard-yellow leather coat _ this from a man who hates
yellow so much he has the daffodils at his place in Connecticut
mowed down.
</P>
<P>
   There has been talk of Blass retiring, but that doesn't seem
imminent _ and his clients don't like the prospect. When asked, Nan
Kempner, the Park Avenue hostess and couture stalwart (she was
wearing a tan Saint Laurent suit), uttered a vulgar word that
teen-age girls use with reference to bands they don't like. Mrs.
Kempner shrugged, ``He's going to have to clone himself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been talking about retiring for 20 years,'' Pat Buckley
said, rolling her eyes. ``He never will. Besides, what are we going
to do for frocks?''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Blass treated his ladies to lunch. This week, he
plans to see Nancy Reagan in New York.
</P>
<P>
   People often think of Beene as a cerebral designer, but that
makes him sound dreary, and he isn't that. Before his show at the
Puck Building on Thursday (he liked the idea of showing with the
young South of Seventh designers), Beene said his collection was
about order and protection _ think armor.
</P>
<P>
   And he added that his muses were Joan of Arc and Helen of Troy.
Given that Joan was burned at the stake, Beene was asked to comment
about Helen's fate. He laughed impishly. ``I don't know what
happened once she got off the horse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Beene's show, in fact, was filled with order but also held
surprises. There were simple jersey dresses in black and taupe with
raised seams suggesting armored plates, and some heathery tweeds
with a solid sense of propriety. But there were also curvaceous
black gowns with rhinestone zippers that brought to mind the glam
era of Gianni Versace (funny, that) and a ruby-red gown with a
breastplate of sequins. There was also a sweet bolero that could be
unzipped around the shoulders to make the collar into a saucy
muffler.
</P>
<P>
   Beene, who has the prestige of dressing some of the smartest
women around, ended his show with a nod to his newer compatriots.
He played Petula Clark's ``Downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   Being in SoHo seemed to work for Joan Vass, too. Her collection,
called ``Anything Goes!'' opened with a model sauntering out in
black wool trousers, a sweater with ``carpe diem'' knitted into it,
and a silver-fox stolelike something called a ``fribble'' nestled
around her shoulders. The collection was strong on youthful
shearling and fur coats, and Ms. Vass' wonderful hand-knits.

COURT REPORT SEEKS TO LIMIT SEQUESTRATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By VIVIAN S. TOY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jurors in trials involving violent crimes, except for
the handful of death penalty cases that arise each year, should no
longer be required to be sequestered during deliberations,
according to a report released Monday by New York state court
officials.
</P>
<P>
   New York is the only state that requires the sequestration of
jurors in trials involving violent crimes. But a study done by the
Office of Court Administration found that a statewide experiment
allowing jurors in nonviolent criminal trials to go home during
deliberations has saved the state $3.5 million in the last four
years and has not caused any increase in allegations of jury
tampering or in mistrials, as some prosecutors and defense lawyers
had feared.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen that separating juries works in the interest of the
public on all levels,'' said Jonathan Lippman, the state's chief
administrative judge. ``We're able to take better care of jurors,
save money and continue the administration of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Lippman said he hoped that legislation enacting the study's
recommendations would be passed by the state Legislature and signed
by Gov. George Pataki this year.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders in both houses of the Legislature said they were
amenable to the idea. State Sen. James Lack, the chairman of the
Senate Judiciary Committee, said that committee would review the
study and act on it quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly have no built-in bias in favor of a court system
that is costly and not necessary for the administration of
justice,'' said Lack, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Helene Weinstein, a Democrat from Brooklyn who is the chairwoman
of the Assembly Judiciary Committee, said she would reserve
judgment until she could study the report, but she said, ``The
Assembly would definitely be open to looking at this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also want to talk to affected parties such as defense
attorneys, district attorneys, judges and court officers before I
really go further,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1995, juries in all criminal trials were required to be
sequestered during deliberations. But Pataki signed a temporary law
that year allowing judges to send juries home except in cases of
violent felonies, like murder, rape and assault. Jurors in those
cases could avoid being sequestered only with the agreement of the
judge and all parties to the case.
</P>
<P>
   The temporary law expires in June, and the report recommends
that it be made permanent and expanded to lift required
sequestration from all criminal trials, except for death penalty
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the law have argued that mandatory sequestration
discouraged people from wanting to be on juries and that juries
often speeded up their deliberations not on the merits of the case
but simply to avoid being held overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that there was only one mistrial out of 935
criminal trials in which juries were not required to be sequestered
in the last two years. In that case, which involved a drug-dealing
charge, the judge declared a mistrial when one of the jurors did
not show up on the second day of deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were concerns that by separating juries you run the risk
of jury tampering, but there virtually were no problems
whatsoever,'' Lippman said. ``So we feel there's no logical reason
or public purpose for continuing to sequester juries.''
</P>
<P>
   Lack said that he had not received any complaints from judges or
lawyers since the temporary law was enacted.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that since 1995, about 15,000 jurors have
avoided overnight sequestration because of the temporary law,
saving the state nearly $3.5 million in security, hotel and meal
costs. The report estimated that it costs the state $2,800 per
night to sequester a jury.
</P>
<P>
   Lippman said that broadening the law to violent crime trials
would affect about 1,000 cases each year and would save the state
an additional $2 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Lefcourt, a Manhattan lawyer who is a former president of
the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, said he
agreed with the study's recommendations, noting that the policy has
long been routine in all federal criminal trials. He called
mandatory sequestration ``an antiquated law which is a waste of
costly resources.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good thing not to have jurors locked up if
there's no threat to their ability to be impartial,'' he said.
``There is very little downside to this that anyone has ever
suggested.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Compton, the president of the New York State Supreme
Court Officers Association, which represents 1,400 of the state's
3,700 court officers, said Monday night that his group opposes
lifting mandatory sequestration.
</P>
<P>
   He said any money that the state might save in court officers'
overtime would be offset because judges might be inclined to keep
juries in session beyond normal court hours. ``Court salaries are
probably $3,000 a day,'' he said, ``and when that jury stays out
another five, six, seven days, they're blowing that $3 million they
think they're saving.''
</P>
<P>
   Calls to the governor's press office were not returned Monday.

EDITOR'S EYE IS ON A PRIZE: THE TRUST OF HIS READERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The only good part of knowing in advance that you
have not won your craft's most prestigious award (take it from an
old hand at this) is that you get to sleep well the night before.
No anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   So Bernard Stein was well rested when he awoke Monday, the day
they handed out the latest batch of Pulitzer Prizes. You can hardly
win a contest you have not entered. Stein figured why even bother
this time, since he had won the prize only a year ago for his
hard-nosed editorials in The Riverdale Press, the weekly community
newspaper in the northwest Bronx that his family has run for nearly
half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he confessed to a vague sense of letdown. Not that there
is really any comparison, but he kind of understood how a Miss
America must feel on the last day of her reign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised I felt that way,'' he acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Oh well. Life goes on, and Stein does have his coveted Pulitzer
safely in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important, he also has his newspaper (circulation
14,000), with its articles about his neighborhood and its notices
of future local meetings that are not destined to find their way
into larger newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Those items are the very oxygen of a community newspaper, said
Stein, 57, who is the editor and co-publisher, with his brother,
Richard. For him, the message of all publications like his comes
close to a holy invocation: ``to persuade people that their lives
are important.''
</P>
<P>
   He was sitting Monday in a coffee shop near the Bronx County
Courthouse, where a school board corruption case that he had long
been following was about to go to trial. There was time to talk for
a little while about what happens when it is your turn for the
proverbial 15 minutes of fame that is supposedly due all of us.
After all, it isn't every year that a newspaper as small as his
grabs the brass ring.
</P>
<P>
   Does life suddenly change?
</P>
<P>
   No, it would seem. And yes.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of his work is the same, Stein said, and so, sad to
say, is the newspaper's circulation. He doesn't find it any easier
``getting a table in a restaurant other than the one my
sister-in-law's family runs.''
</P>
<P>
   But he quickly learned that winning a big-deal award can mean
that your opinion, on everything from the Bronx to Bosnia, is
sought by people who might never have heard of you before. He even
had the American Journalism Review on the phone asking for his
favorite words. (Try ``nugatory,'' which he missed on his SATs
years ago. It has nothing to do with a box of candy. It means
``trifling'' or ``worthless.'')
</P>
<P>
   What he finds most gratifying about his Pulitzer, Stein said, is
that many Riverdale neighbors and readers feel that it belongs to
them, too, in a way. Sure, critics of his editorials can put him
down with a new flourish: ``And you call yourself a Pulitzer Prize
winner!''
</P>
<P>
   But more typical is a man he bumped into at the doctor's office.
``It's like the home team hit one over the fence,'' the fellow
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The home team.'' That notion is what community newspapering
boils down to, whether in the Bronx or in Podunk.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being ``journalism's minor league,'' Stein said, his
type of paper can give readers a sense of their worth, while the
``big media help to make people feel powerless.''
</P>
<P>
   This last Year of Monica has been far from American journalism's
best, many critics would say. Small newspapers, Stein said, have
found themselves caught up in the breast-beating over the press'
failings. But only up to a point. By definition, what he writes can
affect readers in very real and immediate ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're accurate about something they know about on a
consistent basis, they do come to trust you,'' he said, adding:
``When I use `we' in an editorial, it's not the editorial `we.'
It's we, the residents of our area.''
</P>
<P>
   And then he had to go. There was a court case to cover.

NFL TEAMS MAY BE FLUNKING THEIR OWN TESTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a time when all that mattered about Texas running back
Ricky Williams was his performance on the field. Then came the hair
issue. Some teams did not like his braids. Then there was the agent
issue. Some teams thought his manager, the rapper Master P, would
be a hindrance in contract negotiations. Then the weight issue. He
was supposedly 20 pounds too heavy.
</P>
<P>
   The truth? Williams, the Heisman Trophy winner, did not show up
to the Indianapolis scouting combine two months ago with 20
rappers, just several friends and business partners. The person who
will negotiate his contracts is not a rapper but the agent Leland
Hardy, a graduate of the Wharton School of business. The weight?
Not 20 pounds over but 7 or 8.
</P>
<P>
   Williams (5 feet 10 inches, 224 pounds) recently completed a
six-team, six-city tour that lasted three days and, contrary to
speculation, remains a serious possibility for the Cleveland
Browns, who select No. 1 overall in this weekend's National
Football League draft.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is not the only one who has undergone intense scrutiny.
Despite throwing for over 4,000 yards at Kentucky last season, Tim
Couch is facing questions about his arm strength. Akili Smith was
smart enough to step into Oregon's starting lineup last year and
complete 58 percent of his passes, but there are questions about
his smarts because he once scored poorly on the Wunderlich
intelligence test.
</P>
<P>
   What is going on here?
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more teams are paying attention to the things that
count the least, like the combine or workouts or other things,''
said Russell Lande, a former scout for the St. Louis Rams, who
publishes his own draft guide.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost as if the Browns and other teams are beginning to
outthink themselves. That is why the 1999 draft has an uncertain
feeling about it, one similar to that of the 1995 draft, in which
Terrell Davis was selected in the sixth round by Denver and Jamal
Anderson in the seventh by Atlanta. Both players were in the Super
Bowl last season.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland is deciding among Couch, Smith, Williams and even
trading the pick. At this point, the Browns are unsure what to do.
Many teams seem to be undecided, and the possibility of at least
two trades in the first round _ perhaps even within the first five
picks _ remains a strong one.
</P>
<P>
   Browns coach Chris Palmer said the three players are ``neck and
neck coming down the stretch.'' Browns President Carmen Policy said
a decision might not be made until draft day. This is more than
just talk; the Browns can't make up their mind.
</P>
<P>
   This draft is shaping up to be quite different from last
season's, when everyone with a football IQ over 10 knew the
Indianapolis Colts were going to take Peyton Manning with the first
pick and the San Diego Chargers, selecting second, were locked onto
Ryan Leaf. There was no confusion and, for the most part, the draft
fell into place with few surprises.
</P>
<P>
   This year there is plenty of guessing, in part because teams are
paying less attention to on-field performance and more to
postseason workouts. This is bound to lead to players slipping who
should be drafted higher, and the escalation of a player's stock
who should be drafted lower.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is a perfect example of a player who has been through
the analysis wringer. He was hot, then not, and is now hot again.
Still, scouts have tried to find something wrong, picking at him
like leftover turkey. During a workout in California, he was timed
by the Browns as running a 40-yard dash in around 4.5 seconds. This
was viewed by some league scouts as disappointing. Why? Almost
every team knew that what made Williams a great back at Texas was
not blazing speed, but toughness, elusiveness and durability.
</P>
<P>
   One team desperate to draft Williams is New Orleans, owners of
the 12th overall pick. General Manager Bill Kuharich began calling
the top five teams this week about a trade in which the Saints
would offer all seven of their draft picks plus at least two more
from the 2000 draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at the poker table, we have our cards, and so far no
one is at the table with us,'' Kuharich said. ``But that will
change once the draft gets here. We'll have some company.''

 &HT;    Texas hires Rutgers assistant
 &HT;    By Randy Riggs
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When he accepted an assistant's job at Rutgers
two years ago, Rob Lanier told himself his next professional move
would be to become a head basketball coach.
</P>
<P>
   He reconsidered, however, when Rick Barnes came calling.
Consequently, the 30-year-old Lanier on Monday became Barnes'
newest assistant at the University of Texas _ primarily because of
Barnes' track record of having his assistants get head coaching
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Lanier replaces Ricky Stokes, who became the fifth Barnes
assistant to land a head coaching job when he left UT for Virginia
Tech last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky's a really good friend of mine,'' Lanier said Monday.
``When I saw the picture of him at the podium at the Virginia Tech
press conference, I thought it would be a great opportunity to work
with Rick Barnes. I'm glad it's all worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Lanier, cousin of former NBA great Bob Lanier, is renowned as a
strong recruiter who helped reverse the fortunes at Rutgers in his
two years at the Big East school. The fact he left during the
current spring signing period and began working for Texas on Monday
did not please Scarlet Knights head coach Kevin Bannon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not great timing. It's a delicate time, actually,''
Bannon told the Newark (N. J.) Star-Ledger. ``But Rob has done a
great job for us. I wish him the best. It's a great opportunity for
him. We'll just have to keep the ship afloat in terms of
recruiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Lanier _ who has extensive recruiting contacts overseas,
especially in Africa _ acknowledged that his departure ``wasn't
very well received in the (Rutgers) basketball office, and I
understand that. There is no right time. But for me, the chance to
come to Texas and work for Rick is the opportunity of my career. It
was a big-picture decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Stokes had the title of associate head coach at UT, but Lanier
will be an assistant, along with current assistant Brian Cousins.
Both will be allowed to recruit off-campus.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes was unavailable for comment on Monday, but in a prepared
statement he called Lanier ``one of the top assistant coaches in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rob is a great recruiter with solid connections all over the
country . . . but he's more than just a great recruiter,'' Barnes
added. ``He is skilled in every area of the coaching profession,
and I know he'll be a fine head coach in the near future.''
</P>
<P>
   Lanier, a native of Buffalo, N.Y., spent five years as an
assistant at his alma mater, St. Bonaventure, before going to
Rutgers. He began his coaching career at Niagara University. He was
married this past summer to Dr. Dayo Wilson.

NOT GUILTY PLEA IN NEW JERSEY OFFICER'S KILLING
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ A 24-year-old man pleaded not guilty Monday to
the murder of a police officer in Orange, and his lawyer said
afterward that he would soon present evidence that the man was
elsewhere at the time of last Thursday's shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Terrance Everrett, stood motionless and silent
during his arraignment on murder, robbery and weapons charges. His
lawyer, Raymond Hamlin, entered not guilty pleas to each count, and
Judge Betty J. Lester ordered Everrett held on $1 million bail.
</P>
<P>
   The police say Everrett accosted people on the street at
gunpoint on Thursday evening, minutes before he was stopped by
Officer Joyce Anne Carnegie, 38, whom they say he shot to death.
</P>
<P>
   After a manhunt by scores of officers, Everrett was arrested on
Saturday night at the East Orange home he shares with his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters after Monday's arraignment, Hamlin said he
would show that his client was not at the scene of the shooting,
but he would not say when he would present the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready, willing and able to show that he didn't do the
things he is charged with,'' Hamlin said. ``We understand that
someone else was taken into custody, and the fact that my client
has been arraigned doesn't mean that this might not be resolved
favorably for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer was referring to raids at two Newark apartments on
Sunday night by investigators from Orange and Newark police and the
Essex County Prosecutor's office.
</P>
<P>
   In one raid, James Coker, 29, was arrested and charged with
possession of crack and with trying to swallow the drugs when the
police arrived at his apartment.
</P>
<P>
   A Newark police official said Monday that the raids were part of
the investigation into the shooting of Carnegie. But the official
did not say what led them to Coker, who has not been charged in
connection with Carnegie's death.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Weiss, a spokesman for the prosecutor, would not comment on
the raids or the arrest of Coker, except to say that the
investigation was continuing.

 &HT;    Senate bill to help prosecute 8-liner games passes hurdle
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Senate gave tentative approval Monday to a
bill it said strengthens anti-gambling laws by making it easier to
prosecute operators of eight-liner machines, but critics say the
measure actually expands some forms of gambling and puts corporate
profits above community fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texans shouldn't be fooled into believing this is
anti-gambling legislation,'' said Bob Young, president of the
Amusement and Music Operators of Texas. ``This bill is designed to
grab a few headlines and quietly eliminate the competition for
corporate gaming interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill sponsors bill discounted the criticism and said the bill
ensures that eight-liners won't continue to spread across the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers and Gov. George W. Bush have argued for years
that eight-liners are illegal. They add, however, that the law
needs to be clarified so that prosecutors can effectively go after
people who own and operate the machines.
</P>
<P>
   Eight-liner operators say their machines are legal but admit
that some people are pushing the limits of the law.
</P>
<P>
   Eight-liners often look and operate like slot machines. They
offer eight ways by which players can win. In some parts of the
state, owners and operators have set up ``casinos'' filled with
eight-liner machines.
</P>
<P>
   Current law makes most games of chance _ those that require
little or no skill to win _ illegal. The state lottery, charity
bingo and betting at dog and horse races are exceptions to the law.
</P>
<P>
   Another exception are ``Fuzzy Animal'' games. Those games, like
crane machines that are common in children's arcades, cannot give
prizes worth more than $5 and cannot give any cash prizes. They
often give novelty items and stuffed animals.
</P>
<P>
   Some eight-liner operators use the fuzzy animal exception to
give away gift certificates _ the paper itself not worth more than
$5 _ that can be traded for cash or prizes worth more than $5.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. David Sibley, R-Waco, wants to rid the state of
eight-liners and any other games that look like or operate like
slot machines and gambling devices.
</P>
<P>
   Sibley's Senate Bill 970, expected to go to the House today
would redefine ``Fuzzy Animal'' machines as ``bona fide amusement
devices.'' Skill would have to be the predominant factor to winning
the games, and prizes still could not be worth more than $5. If the
machines gave out certificates or vouchers, they would have to be
redeemed at the same place the game was played and couldn't be
redeemed for prizes worth more than $5 per play.
</P>
<P>
   A person still could play a game several times, collect several
certificates and receive a prize worth more than $5. The average
wholesale price of any prize couldn't be worth more than $10.
</P>
<P>
   Officials for the Veterans of Foreign Wars organizations, which
do charity and community fund-raising, want eight-liners to remain
legal. But they said requiring on-site redemption would severely
limit their charity work.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also allows owners and operators of race tracks, bingo
halls and lottery retailers that also sell liquor for on-site
consumption to offer games that give away certificates redeemable
for lottery tickets, free bingo games and pari-mutual bets. Young
and veterans' groups say that's putting corporations ahead of
nonprofit groups and mom and pop stores that use eight-liners.

 &HT;    Elie ignites Spurs to easy win over Suns
 &HT;    By Mark Rosner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ Mario Elie does more than talk tough. He
plays that way, too.
</P>
<P>
   Elie, the first-year San Antonio Spur who has sometimes
criticized his teammates' level of intensity, showed them how it's
done in the fourth quarter Monday, when it really counted. After
the Spurs allowed Phoenix to cut a 20-point lead to nine, Elie
scored seven straight points, recharging the Spurs, who pulled away
for a 94-77 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Elie, who did not start the second half, scored seven of his
eight points in the fourth quarter. Early in the period, neither
San Antonio's Avery Johnson nor Phoenix's Jason Kidd could control
a jump ball at midcourt. Elie outwrestled Chris Morris for the
loose ball and completed a three-point play, dribbling quickly to
the basket for a dunk while Morris fouled him. Elie then hit two
jump shots from just inside the three-point line.
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, San Antonio (25-11) split its four-game season
series with Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Duncan led the Spurs with 26 points. Johnson scored 20, and
David Robinson had 13 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix (18-20), trailing by 20 with 2:30 left in the third
quarter, finished the period with a 9-0 run, making the Spurs work
some more for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Robinson scored 25 for the Suns, and Kidd was effective
against the Spurs for the fourth straight game this season
o(accent) 22 points, nine rebounds and nine assists. Kidd arrived
in San Antonio averaging nearly a triple-double in three games
against the Spurs o(accent) 14 points, 13 assists and 9.7 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson scored 15 points in the first half, hitting seven of
eight shots. Left open when the Suns double-teamed Duncan inside,
Johnson hit three perimeter jumpers. He scored three times on
fastbreak layups. On one of them, Johnson froze Rex Chapman with a
hesitation move before blowing by for the easy basket that
completed a 20-3 run for the Spurs in the second quarter. They led
by 19 at the half.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan had a hard-earned 17 points in the half, working through
the double-teams to hit eight of 14 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd had 11 points, eight assists and five rebounds in the half
for Phoenix, the type of production the Spurs expect from him
against them. Phoenix played Monday without two starters, forward
Tom Gugliotta and center Luc Longley, both of whom have
hyperextended knees.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs have to play three games in three days this week. They
are at Dallas tonight and return to the Alamodome to play Minnesota
on Wednesday. San Antonio played three games in three days earlier
this season, sandwiching victories over Denver and Dallas around a
loss to Toronto.

GURNEY FOLLOWS FATHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ It was only natural that Alex Gurney would
want to pursue auto racing. After all, his father, Dan Gurney,
spent 15 years racing all over the world. It was also natural that
Alex's parents would want to protect their son from the dangerous
sport and steer him to another career.
</P>
<P>
   But Alex wouldn't have it any other way. He convinced his
parents that his passion was real and now they fully support their
son, who is preparing for the most important journey of his young
life.
</P>
<P>
   Alex embarks on his second year as a professional and first in
the Kool/Toyota Atlantic Championship when the series opens at the
Long Beach Toyota Grand Prix on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Newport Beach native has been a fan at the Long Beach race
for as long as he can remember. But instead of being in the
grandstands, he will be behind the wheel this time, in front of
family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something I've dreamed about,'' said the 24-year-old,
who is a member of Team Kool Green.
</P>
<P>
   What makes it better is that his father, his hero, is behind
him.
</P>
<P>
   Alex wasn't even born when his father retired from professional
racing and formed All American Racers, which designs and
manufactures race cars. Dan became the top road racer in America
and was very popular on the European Circuit from 1955 to 1970. By
the time young Alex saw his father compete, Dan was racing in the
Celebrity-Pro Race in Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dangerous, difficult way of making a living,'' said
Dan, who is the co-grand marshal for the Long Beach Toyota Grand
Prix. ``I felt that I didn't want to encourage him. But by the same
token, we said if sufficient passion is there, if you graduate from
college with a degree and then if the flame is still burning to be
a race-car driver, by then you have to say, `Well, maybe this is
real.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It was. Alex graduated with a business degree from the
University of Colorado and raced go-karts in his spare time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I started winning and started to show that this is really
what I wanted to do, they got a little more open to it,'' Alex
said.
</P>
<P>
   He made his professional debut last year in the Barber Dodge Pro
Series, where he finished 10th. He had 12 starts, four top-10
finishes, and won the pole at Homestead, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Although the cars are similar in form, the Atlantics are a step
up. And so are Alex's goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm shooting for Rookie of the Year,'' he said. ``I obviously
have a lot to learn. I hope to be in the Atlantics next year as
well, but we plan to be competitive at every race. We've done a lot
of testing.''
</P>
<P>
   Alex will be tested against an experienced field of top
returnees: Lee Bentham, who won the championship last year; Andrew
Bordin, who finished second in the series and second at Long Beach;
Buddy Rice, who won the pole here last year, and Anthony Lazzaro.
</P>
<P>
   But Alex won't feel out of place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long Beach is an interesting place for me to start out,'' he
said. ``I've been coming here, basically, since I was born. I've
been up in the stands every year. It will be a pretty special
feeling being out there in a real race car.'' &QL;
