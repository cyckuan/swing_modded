<HEADLINE> Astros' Howell Placed on DL Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) - The Houston Astros placed infielder Jack Howell  
on the 15-day disabled list retroactive to July 18 with a wrist 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	An MRI confirmed Tuesday that Howell ruptured the tendon sheath  
in his right wrist. He will be out at least three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the second time this year Howell, 37, will be on the  
disabled list. He missed 27 games from May 26-June 24 with a pulled 
groin. The Astros have nine players currently on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	To replace Howell, the Astros recalled first baseman Daryle Ward  
from Triple-A New Orleans of the Pacific Coast League. The 
24-year-old was hitting .353 with a league-leading 28 home runs and 
65 RBIs.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Continue Rise / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly  
higher today in early dealings on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say prices were buoyed, in part, by U.S. Department of  
Agriculture data showing declines in crop progress. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices were already on an upward trend Monday amid reports that  
continued hot, dry weather could damage crops in parts of the 
Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said today that the concern is particularly strong for  
corn -- though some parts of Illinois, Iowa and Minnesota got rain 
overnight, easing some of the dryness. 
</P>
<P>
	In early trading today, wheat for September delivery was up a  
cent to $2.46 1/4 a bushel; September corn rose 1 1/4 cents to $1.93 a 
bushel; September oats were up 1 1/4 to $1.07 1/4 a bushel; and August 
soybeans climbed a cent to $4.24 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, livestock and meat futures prices were mixed in early  
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle fell .38 cent to 63.72 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle were down .20 cent to 76.42 cents a pound; August 
lean hogs dropped 1.67 cents to 45.45 cents a pound; and August 
pork bellies rose .45 cent to 34.50 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Texas Instruments Sales, Earnings Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Second-quarter profits for Texas Instruments Inc.  
were up in part because of growth in semiconductor shipments and 
royalties, the company said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas-based chip company earned $325 million, or 80 cents  
per diluted share, in the quarter ended June 30, compared with a 
profit of $43 million, or 11 cents a diluted share, in the year-ago 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue increased 8 percent to $2.34 billion from $2.16 billion  
as growth in semiconductor sales more than offset the loss of 
revenue from the memory business TI divested in last year's third 
quarter, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	TI also said the quarter's revenues included $85 million for  
catch-up royalties due under a previously announced agreement with 
Hyundai Electronics Industries Co., which contributed about 12 
cents per share in earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen significant progress in our strategy and  
significant progress in our operating performance,'' said Tom 
Engibous, company chairman, president and chief executive. ``As the 
industry shifts to growth driven by communications, the 
proliferation of new markets will continue, powered by TI's DSP and 
analog technologies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On July 15, TI announced a two-for-one stock split in the form  
of a 100 percent stock dividend, payable on August 16. 
Second-quarter results were calculated on a pre-split basis. 
</P>
<P>
	TI said its results included a special charge of $52 million for  
research and development associated with the acquisition of Libit 
Signal Processing Ltd. The company also noted that in last year's 
second quarter, there was a special charge of $233 million for a 
worldwide restructuring of support functions and consolidation of 
manufacturing operations, as well as an $83 million gain on the 
sale of TI's shares in the TI-Acer joint venture to Acer 
Corporation. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the special charges, earnings would have been 92 cents  
per diluted share, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	TI said it anticipates continued growth in its semiconductor  
business in the second half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The company raised its estimate for industry sales of digital  
phones from 230 million to 245 million units this year. It said it 
expects continued strength in the mass market for both digital 
signal processor and analog catalog components, as these products 
continue to penetrate new applications and markets.

<HEADLINE> Public Broadcasters Regret List Swap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Corporation for Public Broadcasting said  
Tuesday that 26 member public television stations in major markets 
appear to have exchanged membership lists with political 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Testifying at a politically charged congressional hearing,  
Robert T. Coonrod, the corporation's president, said a recent 
survey found that 53 of 75 television stations in large markets 
used third-party brokers to exchange membership lists with other 
nonprofit organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Of those, he said, fewer than 30 television stations appear to  
have exchanged names with political organizations aligned with 
either the Democratic or Republican parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the corporation narrowed the number to 26. Officials did  
not identify the stations, saying that the survey information was 
largely anecdotal and needed further verification. A report from 
the corporation's inspector general is due later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Coonrod said all the contact between public broadcasters and  
political organizations appears to have been through brokers. He 
acknowledged, however, that investigations are under way, and ``it 
is possible there is information out there that we haven't 
collected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the stations that exchanged membership  
information, about 30 also received lists from political 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, stations in such major markets as Boston, New  
York and Washington have acknowledged making membership lists 
available to political organizations, including the Democratic 
National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The DNC has said that it always goes through brokers in order to  
obtain lists for fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the DNC and other Democratic organizations such  
as California Sen. Barbara Boxer's campaign, at least seven 
Republican entities have been involved in list-swapping, including 
Bob Dole's 1996 presidential campaign, said Coonrod. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy centers on whether public broadcasters violated  
federal tax law by providing their lists to political groups. The 
Internal Revenue Service typically imposes a three-year statute of 
limitations on such violations. 
</P>
<P>
	Although sharing membership lists is a legitimate business  
practice done daily by countless organizations, the corporation is 
a private, nonprofit entity that is considered a charity for tax 
purposes. As such, it is barred from direct or indirect 
interventions in political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	The corporation distributes federal money to public radio and  
television stations, National Public Radio and the Public 
Broadcasting Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Providing lists to a political group would not necessarily  
constitute an improper intervention as long as the lists were 
provided equally to all campaigns or parties, tax specialists say. 
</P>
<P>
	At the hearing, public broadcasting executives pledged to  
investigate and halt all political list-swapping, even as 
congressional Republicans continued to condemn the practice and 
demand a review of the industry's federal funding. 
</P>
<P>
	Ervin S. Duggan, the PBS president, said an advisory would go  
out this week urging member stations to ``establish policies 
strictly prohibiting the exchange or rental of lists to partisan 
political campaigns, committees or groups.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., chairman of the House Commerce  
subcommittee on telecommunications, suggested imposing sanctions on 
stations that have engaged in the practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Tauzin is also drafting a bill to authorize funding for the  
corporation at lower levels than initially proposed. Earlier, 
Tauzin recommended $300 million in 2000 and up to $475 million a 
year from 2002 to 2006. 
</P>
<P>
	The corporation now gets about $250 million a year, or about 15  
percent of its budget, from the federal government. The rest comes 
from businesses, foundations, state governments and viewers.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Taiwan's major stock market index surged nearly  
6 percent higher today in hopes tensions would ease between Beijing 
and Taipei. The rally helped lift shares in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, Asia's largest financial market was closed for a  
national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taiwan market's Weighted Stock Price Index rose 419.96  
points, or by 5.68 percent, to 7,806.85. 
</P>
<P>
	The index had shed almost 13 percent over the previous week  
after Taiwan's president, Lee Teng-hui, said China must deal with 
Taiwan ``on a state-to-state basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Markets were rattled by China's stern warnings against any  
attempt to break away and amid reports of Chinese military 
maneuvers. The market's slide had prompted the Taiwanese government 
to intervene and buy shares to prop up prices. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first public remarks since setting off an uproar in  
Beijing, Lee today called for public support of his bold new 
statehood claim, saying it was necessary to prepare Taiwan for 
political talks with China. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee said he made the point that Taiwan must deal with China ``on  
a state-to-state basis'' in order to stress the equal political 
status of the two, and not to champion the island's independence. 
</P>
<P>
	In expectation that Lee's speech could help ease tensions with  
China, the stock market rebounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong stocks rallied Tuesday after two straight sessions of  
declines, boosted by the sharp rally on the Taipei Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, rose 153.27 points, or 1.1 percent, to close at 
13,600.40. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said bargain-hunters jumped into the Hong Kong market  
following the sharp rise in Taiwan. Traders said the Hong Kong 
market will continue to take its cues from developments between 
China and Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, South Korea's main index fell 2.5 percent on worries  
that interest rates will rise further and amid uncertainty over the 
restructuring plans for Daewoo, the country's second-largest 
conglomerate.

<HEADLINE> Promissory Note Warning Issued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- State securities regulators are warning  
investors about promissory notes, investments promising high 
interest rates, that they say are very risky and often fraudulent. 
</P>
<P>
	Scam artists selling bogus promissory notes work to gain  
investors' trust, in some cases getting down on their knees and 
praying with the people they are ripping off, the North American 
Securities Administrators Association said Monday. The elderly are 
especially targeted. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities in at least 35 states have received complaints or  
taken enforcement actions involving promissory notes, according to 
NASAA, which is comprised of securities regulators from the 50 
states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Canada and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, 20 states have set up a task force on promissory  
notes led by Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The notes often are sold by life insurance agents, lured by high  
commissions, who may know nothing about the promoters of the 
investment or may not be aware that they must be licensed as 
securities brokers with the state to sell such investments, NASAA 
said. Some promissory notes have been issued on behalf of companies 
that don't exist. 
</P>
<P>
	While the record low interest rates now prevailing are great for  
the economy, ``it's been hard on people dependent on interest 
income -- and desperate people make tempting targets for crooks,'' 
said Bradley Skolnik, Indiana's securities commissioner and NASAA 
president-elect. 
</P>
<P>
	A typical scam works this way:  
</P>
<P>
	--A life insurance agent who previously sold you a policy phones  
you about an investment opportunity, saying a well-established 
company wants to expand its business and needs to raise capital. 
Instead of borrowing money from a bank, the agent tells you, the 
company is offering investors a chance to buy promissory notes -- 
typically with a nine-month maturity period and paying annual 
interest of 12 percent to 18 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--The agent pressures you to cash in your life insurance policy  
and ``roll'' it into the promissory notes. 
</P>
<P>
	--The fraudulent companies that issue the notes either abscond  
with the investors' money when the notes mature or use a classic 
Ponzi scheme to pay earlier investors with money from newer ones 
until the scam collapses. 
</P>
<P>
	The state regulators offer these tips for investors:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Before investing in any promissory note, always check with  
your state securities regulator (information available at 
www.nasaa.org) to confirm that the note is properly registered or 
legally exempt from registration. 
</P>
<P>
	--Look into the legitimacy of the company issuing the notes.  
</P>
<P>
	--Agents selling the notes usually must be licensed by both the  
state they work in and the National Association of Securities 
Dealers. To find out if the agent is registered or if he or she has 
a disciplinary history, contact your state securities regulator or 
call NASD's public disclosure hotline at 1-800-289-9999. 
</P>
<P>
	--Be suspicious if the notes have an above-market interest rate  
and a maturity of less than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20 states forming the new task force are California,  
Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, 
Mississippi, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, 
Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Virginia, 
Washington and Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> United Technologies Profits Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- United Technologies Corp. reported a 19  
percent increase in second-quarter profits on strong performances 
in its Carrier air-conditioning, Otis elevators and Pratt &AMP; Whitney 
jet engine segments. 
</P>
<P>
	UTC earned $427 million, or 85 cents per share, excluding a  
one-time gain of $650 million from the sale of the company's 
automotive business. That compares with net income of $360 million, 
or 72 cents per share in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Including the gain, net income was $1.07 billion, or $2.15 per  
share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues increased 4 percent to $6.04 billion, up from $5.83  
billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	UTC said all four of its business segments reported double-digit  
percentage increases in operating profit. 
</P>
<P>
	Carrier's operating profit jumped 20 percent on 8 percent  
revenue growth, fed by higher margins and revenues in North 
America, Europe and the commercial refrigeration business. 
</P>
<P>
	At Otis, operating profit increased 15 percent on a 3 percent  
revenue increase. 
</P>
<P>
	At Pratt &AMP; Whitney, operating profit increased 15 percent on 1  
percent revenue growth. The unit had improvements in large 
commercial engines, as well as its overhaul and repair business, 
but those were partially offset by an expected decline in 
commercial spare parts, higher research and development costs and a 
previously announced early retirement program. 
</P>
<P>
	In UTC's flight segment, which includes Sikorsky helicopters and  
Hamilton Sundstrand aerospace systems, operating profit increased 
11 percent on 1 percent revenue growth. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, UTC completed the sale of its automotive business to  
Lear Corp. for $2.3 billion and realized an after-tax gain of $650 
million. The company said it expects to use the automotive gain to 
take an after-tax charge of $650 million to further strengthen the 
competitive position of its businesses. UTC has classified the 
automotive segment as a discontinued operation in its financial 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of the year, profits increased 19  
percent to $735 million, or $1.47 per share, before the gain from 
the sale of automotive operations, compared with $620 million, or 
$1.24 per share, in the first six months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the first six months increased 3 percent to $11.48  
billion, up from $11.14 billion in the same period a year ago.

	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Hall of Fame quarterback Johnny Unitas was  
hospitalized Tuesday after complaining of chest pains.

	Unitas, 66, was listed in good condition at the University of  
Maryland Medical Center. A hospital spokeswoman said Unitas will

	The former Baltimore Colts star checked into the hospital Monday

<P>
	Sales rose 11 percent to $3.5 billion from $3.2 billion,

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Fight Against Racism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Drawing yet again from President Kennedy's  
legacy, President Clinton today challenged the nation's lawyers to 
diversify their ranks and devote more time to fighting racism 
through pro bono work. 
</P>
<P>
	The president was gathering leaders from various aspects of law,  
such as bar associations, corporation counsels, law firms and civil 
rights attorneys, to issue a ``call to action'' as part of his 
efforts to promote racial dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's event was patterned after a call Kennedy issued in the  
White House East Room on June 21, 1963, before 200 lawyers, urging 
them to condemn Gov. George Wallace's stand against allowing black 
students to enroll in Alabama's public universities. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy was joined by his brother, Attorney General Robert F.  
Kennedy and Vice President Lyndon Johnson, who succeeded Kennedy 
and implemented the ``Great Society'' programs that sought to 
address entrenched poverty, especially among minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Before convening that meeting, Kennedy cast his effort as an  
attempt to prod Americans to take up the battle for racial 
equality. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are confronted, primarily, with a moral issue. It is as old  
as the Scriptures and is as clear as the American Constitution,'' 
Kennedy said. ``The heart of the question is whether all Americans 
are to be afforded equal rights and equal opportunities, whether we 
are going to treat our fellow Americans as we want to be treated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton was  
commemorating the anniversary of Kennedy's call by standing in the 
same room, picking up on his predecessor's desire for the legal 
community ``to get involved with using their skills to eradicate 
racism in this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton planned to announce a series of commitments on promoting  
opportunities for minorities in the legal profession. The 
commitments were worked out among the White House, Justice 
Department, bar associations, law schools and private sector 
attorneys over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	Under those commitments:  
</P>
<P>
	--The American Bar Association will expand programs for  
corporations to hire more minority law firms, encourage more 
lawyers to provide free legal services to the poor and provide 
financial and mentoring assistance to minority law students. 
</P>
<P>
	--The American Corporate Counsel Association will promote  
corporate pro bono services and provide resources so that corporate 
counsels can implement diversity and pro bono services on the local 
level. 
</P>
<P>
	--Some leading law firms will agree to have their attorneys  
commit to spending 50 hours per year, or 3 percent of billable 
time, performing pro bono services for nonwhites or working in 
disadvantaged neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	--The American Association of Law Schools will promote lessons in  
racial justice and public service and encourage students to 
volunteer in minority communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the ABA and ACCA will join with the National Bar  
Association, Hispanic National Bar Association, Native American Bar 
Association, National Asian Pacific American Bar Association, 
Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights and the San Francisco and New 
York City bars to develop a national response to Clinton's call.

<HEADLINE> Rockwell Reports Earns Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COSTA MESA, Calif. (AP) -- Rockwell International Corp. on  
Tuesday reported third-quarter earnings of $150 million on stronger 
sales of its factory automation and airplane control equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockwell's earnings translated to 77 cents per share and  
compared to a loss of $420 million, or $2.60 per share, a year ago 
as the company underwent a costly restructuring that included 
layoffs and the spinoff of its semiconductor business. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings beat the 75-cents-per-share estimate of analysts  
surveyed by First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose to $1.13 billion from $1.12 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Rockwell's businesses include its Automation division, which  
makes motors and electronic equipment, and the Avionics &AMP; 
Communications divisions, which manufacture display and 
communications systems. The company also creates systems for 
companies involved in electronic commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings in Rockwell's automation business grew 14 percent  
during the quarter. Avionics and communications sales jumped 23 
percent, thanks in part to improved markets in the Asia-Pacific 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	For the nine-month period, Rockwell's earnings rose to $427  
million, or $2.21 per share, up from a loss of $238 million, or 
$2.85 per share for the first nine months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine-month sales came to $3.26 billion, down from $3.39 billion.

<HEADLINE> Same Old Argument for Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an old argument about new numbers,  
President Clinton and the Republicans are colliding on tax cuts 
again -- on party lines that were drawn long before there was a 
budget surplus to spend or refund. 
</P>
<P>
	Players and roles have changed, but essentially, Republicans  
want to be the party of the tax cut, arguing that Democrats are 
bent on spending money from Washington that ought to go back to the 
taxpayers. Democrats argue that GOP tax cuts would benefit the rich 
at the expense of programs the rest of America needs. 
</P>
<P>
	They were debating that when Republicans held the White House  
and the Democrats controlled Congress, when the outlook was for 
deficits, not surpluses, for as far as the budget projections could 
see. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1981, President Reagan won tax cuts in a Democratic House --  
the Senate was Republican then as now -- that went far deeper than 
the reductions now on the GOP agenda. The Reagan tax cut was 
projected at $750 billion over five years, on a smaller budget 
base, in a time of deficits, not surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican aim now is a cut of $792 billion over 10 years.  
That's not as much as House GOP leaders wanted, but it may be as 
much as they can get in the Senate. The House is taking up taxes 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has his own tax cut proposal, about $250 billion over 10  
years. Not enough, and not broad enough, Republicans argue. ``He 
says we want tax cuts but only a little bit,'' said Sen. Trent 
Lott, the Senate majority leader. ``Oh, and by the way, he proposes 
about $100 billion in tax increases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration doesn't call them that. They are adjustments  
and steps to close loopholes. Not that Clinton invented semantic 
sidesteps about taxes. The Reagan White House devised the 
description ``revenue enhancement'' to avoid calling an increase an 
increase, the president having said he would veto any bill to raise 
taxes. Enhancing them was OK. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Clinton is saying he will veto tax cuts in the range of  
those Republicans are pushing, saying they would cost money that 
should go into Social Security, Medicare and spending on such 
programs as defense and education. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tax cuts of that size are quite simply bad economic policy,''  
Clinton said in his radio talk on Saturday. He said the Republican 
tax cuts would balloon after 2010, just as the baby boom generation 
begins retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that would ``blow a $3 trillion hole in the federal  
budget, threatening our ability to secure Social Security and 
Medicare for the next generation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans say their plan locks away Social Security  
revenues, then puts one-third of the projected surplus into tax 
cuts. Clinton said his would go further, to strengthen Social 
Security and Medicare financing, and to pay down the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what he wants is typical of Democrats,'' Lott said on  
Fox TV Sunday. ``They want to keep it in Washington and spend it. 
... That's the way they always are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that's the way the argument always goes, like a broken  
record. That may be why the tax cut issue doesn't seem to be 
stirring the people both sides are trying to convince. The polls 
indicate that most Americans think they are overtaxed, but that few 
put tax cuts near the top of their Washington wish list. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, Clinton and the Republicans are going to have to  
settle on a budget, and that means dealing with taxes. The deadline 
is Oct. 1, although stopgap measures can delay that. 
</P>
<P>
	So there's ample time to argue. The word from the White House is  
that Clinton isn't interested in a deal to split the difference 
between his tax cut and the Republicans' plan. Nor is Lott. 
``Nope,'' he said to that idea. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now if he wants to get serious, join with us, great,'' Lott  
said. ``But I think maybe some of the demagoguery needs to be toned 
down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But neither the Clinton administration nor the Republican  
Congress can get what it wants without the other. They'll have to 
pass a version he will sign. So eventually, it will take a 
compromise to do anything.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Mirror Group Chief Wants the Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The ousted chief executive of Mirror Group PLC  
said Tuesday he is trying to arrange financial backing for a bid to 
buy the newspaper group. 
</P>
<P>
	David Montgomery's discussions with financial institutions  
raises the prospect of a three-way battle for ownership of the 
media group, whose flagship is the tabloid Daily Mirror. Montgomery 
was forced out of his job earlier this year by Mirror shareholders 
unhappy with his performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sunday Telegraph reported that Montgomery was preparing to  
launch a $2.1 billion bid to buy Mirror. The British private equity 
company Apax Partners &AMP; Co. is a possible backer for the bid, the 
paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomery would face challenges from regional newspaper group  
Trinity PLC and the privately backed Regional Independent Media 
PLC. Bids from those two companies are currently under 
investigation by the government's Competition Commission. The 
antitrust body is expected to announce a decision about them soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to Montgomery's resignation, some of Mirror's  
institutional shareholders blamed him for the company's poor 
results and its failure to agree to merge -- first with Germany's 
Axel Springer Verlag AG and later with Trinity. 
</P>
<P>
	New Mirror chief executive John Allwood is widely recognized as  
having made the company more financially viable. Since the sale of 
some nonessential operations, Allwood has trimmed Mirror Group's 
debt by 40 percent to $474 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomery's potential bid would value Mirror shares at around  
$4.27 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinity's mixed offer of cash and shares values each Mirror  
share at around $3.79. Regional Independent Media is preparing a 
cash bid worth $3.16 but would have to ask its largest shareholder, 
Candover Investments PLC, for more money if it wants to sweeten its 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock in Mirror Group finished trading Tuesday at $3.95 per  
share, up 1.2 percent from Monday's close.

<HEADLINE> Developers Tour Tiger Stadium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Developers who envision apartments, shops, and a  
fitness center replacing bleachers, concession stands and 
turnstiles at Tiger Stadium have gotten a behind-the-scenes look at 
the park. 
</P>
<P>
	About 50 people showed up for the city planning department's  
tour Monday, including developers from as far away as Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	They ducked into the stadium dugouts and explored the cramped,  
dank, 87-year-old catacomb tunnels beneath the stands. They played 
in the press box and broadcast booth and walked on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	The city hopes someone will invest $150 million to convert the  
stadium into residential and commercial space while preserving the 
historic playing field. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a feat many major league cities have failed to accomplish.  
Classic ballparks like Ebbetts in New York, Forbes in Pittsburgh, 
Crosley in Cincinnati, and Comiskey in Chicago all surrendered to 
the wrecking ball after their baseball teams opened new stadiums. 
The Tigers move into Comerica Park next season. 
</P>
<P>
	But developers said they are interested in reinventing Tiger  
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``The master plan is tremendous,'' developer Richard Kughn told  
The Detroit News. ``The re-use would be unique.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many developers left the tour with questions, however. The city  
didn't have updated environmental evaluations, structural analyses 
and details about the utilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Developers are going to have to distinguish from their hearts  
and saving the stadium and whether it's a good business decision,'' 
said Robert P. Washer, executive vice-president of Storen and Lewis 
in Detroit. ``Everybody is going through that right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Developers have until Aug. 20 to submit proposals to redevelop  
the park. City officials said a developer will be chosen by the 
Tigers' last home game Sept. 27.

<HEADLINE> Brit Cops Charged in Soccer Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEEDS, England (AP) -- Two retired police officers will stand  
trial next month on manslaughter charges over the death of 96 
soccer fans in the 1989 Hillsborough disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	After a hearing to determine the legality of a private  
prosecution brought against the former high-ranking officers by 
families of the dead, a Leeds magistrate on Tuesday ordered both 
men to stand trial on Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Chief Superintendent David Duckenfield, 54, and former  
Superintendent Bernard Murray, 57, are accused in the deaths of 
John Alfred Anderson and James Gary Aspinall on April 15, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Duckenfield and Murray, who were granted bail, are also accused  
of willful neglect of public duty. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson and Aspinall were among Liverpool fans who were crushed  
to death after being herded into an already crowded and fenced-in 
enclosure during the FA Cup semifinal against Nottingham Forest. 
</P>
<P>
	Two earlier attempts in 1990 and 1997 to prosecute the case have  
failed with the Department of Public Prosecution ruling sufficient 
evidence was lacking. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Duckenfield and Murray had attempted to block the  
case from reaching hearing stage. 
</P>
<P>
	But a support group for families involved in the tragedy, the  
Hillsborough Family Support Group, won the right to proceed with 
the prosecution.

<HEADLINE> Trade Deficit Swells to Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's trade deficit surged in May to  
another record as foreign oil prices jumped to their highest level 
since late 1997 and U.S. exporters were battered by the global 
economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported today that the trade deficit  
ballooned to $21.3 billion -- a 14.8 percent increase from the $18.6 
billion deficit in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports of goods and services climbed 2.2 percent to a record  
high of $98.9 billion in May, reflecting higher oil prices and a 
big jump in auto shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, U.S. exports fell 0.8 percent to $77.6 billion  
as demand dropped sharply for commercial aircraft, farm products 
and American-made autos. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, the U.S. trade deficit is running at an annual  
rate of $225 billion, more than one-third higher than last year's 
$164.3 billion, which had been a record high. 
</P>
<P>
	The swelling deficit presents a major political headache for the  
Clinton administration, which is having to fight off growing cries 
for protection from a number of U.S. industries, ranging from steel 
producers to sheep and apple growers. 
</P>
<P>
	American manufacturers and farmers have been battered by the  
global economic turmoil, which has pushed a number of Asian 
countries into steep recessions and forced American companies to 
compete with a flood of cheaper imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Since March 1998, manufacturers have cut 488,000 jobs and U.S.  
farmers are suffering their worst economic crisis in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall U.S. economy, however, has continued to post robust  
growth as consumer spending has remained strong, powered by the 
lowest unemployment rate in nearly three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade deficit in goods and service has set a record in four  
of the last five months, reflecting the fact that a strong U.S. 
economy has propelled demand for imports while American companies 
and farmers have seen their overseas sales shrink. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices of imported crude oil, which for most of last year were  
falling sharply as global demand shrank, have rebounded in recent 
months, sending America's oil bill sharply higher. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, the price of crude oil jumped to $14.54 a barrel, up  
from $12.71 in April and the highest price since December 1997. 
Rising crude prices offset a smaller volume of imported oil to 
boost the bill for foreign oil by 12.8 percent, to $5.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Imported autos and auto parts were up 6 percent in May to $14.5  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop in U.S. exports included a decline of $221 million in  
sales of commercial aircraft, a drop of $283 million in sales of 
consumer goods and a fall of $129 million in sales of U.S. autos. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm sales fell by $29 million with exports of meat, rice and  
corn all down. 
</P>
<P>
	America's deficit with China jumped by 9.7 percent in May to  
$5.3 billion and this year is running 16 percent above the same 
period in 1998. The United States has been pushing China to agree 
to a broad market-opening trade deal that would boost sales of U.S. 
exports in China. However, the Chinese are refusing to return to 
the bargaining table because of their anger over NATO's mistaken 
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.

<HEADLINE> Allied Domecq To Sell Pubs to Punch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Allied Domecq PLC has agreed to sell its pubs for  
$4.4 billion to Punch Taverns Ltd., which emerged as the winner 
after a furious bidding war against rival Whitbread PLC. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied said Tuesday it had agreed to improvements on the terms  
originally offered by Punch after four days of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am satisfied that this price, together with the  
substantially improved terms and conditions of the contract, is an 
excellent result for our shareholders,'' said Allied chairman Sir 
Christopher Hogg. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the total figure, $1.18 billion will be paid in shares of  
Bass PLC and $3.17 billion will be paid in cash. Punch will take on 
debts of $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied shares were up 2.4 percent in midday trading in London.  
</P>
<P>
	The agreement came the day after Allied acknowledged that it had  
initiated talks with at least two other companies that had 
expressed interest in its 3,600 pubs and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	Punch, which already has 2,200 pubs of its own, had been the  
sole remaining bidder on Friday, after Whitbread withdrew its $4.46 
billion offer when the Department of Trade and Industry referred it 
to competition regulators for review. 
</P>
<P>
	Punch, an upstart firm less than two years old, been engaged in  
a vitriolic bidding war against Whitbread, one of Britain's oldest 
brewers. Punch initially offered $4.57 billion in cash for the 
pubs, together with an option for shares in Bass PLC. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied favored Whitbread's bid, even though it was the smaller  
of the two, saying it believed Whitbread could complete the 
purchase more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	After Whitbread's case crumbled, Allied reluctantly agreed to  
negotiate a sale to Punch, and they began discussions Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	A Punch spokesman suggested at the time that it might reduce its  
bid in the wake of Whitbread's withdrawal, and the company 
reportedly revised its offer downward to $4.21 billion before 
finally raising it slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies said the deal did not require approval from  
British regulators and should be completed by mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
	Allied is selling its pubs to focus on its other businesses,  
which include Canadian Club whiskey, Beefeater gin and other 
well-known liquor brands. Allied also owns the Dunkin' Donut and 
Baskin-Robbins ice cream chains.

	Texas Instruments Sales, Earnings Up  
</P>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Second-quarter profits for Texas Instruments Inc.  
were up in part because of growth in semiconductor shipments and 
royalties, the company said today. The Dallas-based chip company 
earned $325 million, or 80 cents per diluted share, in the quarter 
ended June 30, compared with a profit of $43 million, or 11 cents a 
diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue increased 8 percent 
to $2.34 billion from $2.16 billion as growth in semiconductor 
sales more than offset the loss of revenue from the memory business 
TI divested in last year's third quarter, the company said. 

</P>
<P>
	United Technologies Profits Rise  
</P>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- United Technologies Corp. reported a 19  
percent increase in second-quarter profits on strong performances 
in its Carrier air-conditioning, Otis elevators and Pratt &AMP; Whitney 
jet engine segments. UTC earned $427 million, or 85 cents per 
share, excluding a one-time gain of $650 million from the sale of 
the company's automotive business. That compares with net income of 
$360 million, or 72 cents per share in the same period a year ago. 
Including the gain, net income was $1.07 billion, or $2.15 per 
share. Revenues increased 4 percent to $6.04 billion, up from $5.83 
billion a year ago. UTC said all four of its business segments 
reported double-digit percentage increases in operating profit.

	Airline Earnings Take Off  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Northwest Airlines reported its earnings more  
than doubled in the second quarter as it continued its recovery 
from labor problems, and Southwest Airlines and America West also 
reported earnings gains. Northwest Airlines reported earnings of 
$120 million, or $1.29 per share, compared with $49 million, or 51 
cents a share, in the same period last year. Southwest Airlines 
said it earned $157.8 million, or 29 cents per share, up from 
$133.4 million, or 25 cents per share, for the same period last 
year. The figures were a penny below analysts' expectations. 
America West Holdings Corp., the parent of America West, reported 
earnings of $42.3 million, or $1.06 per share, up from $41.4 
million, or 86 cents per share, in the same period a year ago, well 
ahead of analysts's expectations. Northwest stock was up 3/8 at 33 
15/16; Southwest shares were down 1 1/4 at 20 11/16, and America West 
Holdings B, parent of America West, was up 9/16 at 21 5/16.

	Trade Deficit Swells to Record High  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. monthly trade deficit surged in May  
to another record as foreign oil prices jumped to their highest 
level since late 1997 and U.S. exporters were battered by the 
global economic crisis. The Commerce Department reported today that 
the trade deficit ballooned to $21.3 billion -- a 14.8 percent 
increase from the $18.6 billion deficit in April. Imports of goods 
and services climbed 2.2 percent to a record high of $98.9 billion 
in May, reflecting higher oil prices and a big jump in auto 
shipments.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply today as investors who  
bought heavily on the promise of strong corporate earnings began 
trimming their portfolios to capture profits. Just before 3 p.m. 
EDT, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 161.79 at 11,025.89, 
adding to yesterday's drop of 22.16. Broader stock indicators were 
also lower, with the Nasdaq composite index, dominated by 
technology issues, down 92.31 at 2,737.98. Today, a trio of Dow 
components -- Johnson &AMP; Johnson, General Motors and United 
Technologies -- reported earnings that beat Wall Street estimates. 
But with major market indexes close to record levels, few big 
companies have managed any significant bounce from their strong 
earnings. Johnson &AMP; Johnson rose 1/4 to 96 3/16, GM slipped 15/16 to 
67 3/8 and United Technologies rose 3/4 to 69 9/16.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- SBC Communications and merger partner Ameritech  
topped Wall Street forecasts for the second quarter today, with 
both Baby Bell telephone companies showing double-digit profit 
growth. Second-quarter profits grew 15 percent at SBC as the 
regional phone company serving the Southwest and California enjoyed 
strong demand for wireless and high-speed data services. Ameritech, 
which serves the Midwest, had a 21 percent jump in operating 
profits, fueled by growth in high-speed connections and premium

<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Increased sales of light trucks in the hot North  
American market helped General Motors post a record $1.7 billion 
operating profit in the second quarter -- a more than five-fold 
increase over strike-depressed earnings a year ago. The world's No. 
1 automaker earned $2.66 a share, compared with $306 million, or 40 
cents a share, for the April-through-June period of 1998 after 
excluding earnings from GM's former parts unit, Delphi Automotive 
Systems. Delphi was made independent from GM in May. Sales totaled 
$45.1 billion, compared with adjusted revenue of $37.3 billion a 
year ago. GM's earnings exceeded Wall Street analysts' 
expectations.

contraceptive patch for women that is effective for a week, the

dollar, would be the newest type birth control to hit the U.S. 
market in several years. Women would wear it on their stomach, arms 
or buttocks. Early testing shows the patch, called Evra 
Contraceptive Patch, works as effectively as birth control pills. 
The company plans to file for U.S. approval early next year.

	LONDON (AP) -- The ousted chief executive of Mirror Group PLC  
said today he is trying to arrange financial backing for a bid to 
buy the newspaper group. David Montgomery's discussions with 
financial institutions raise the prospect of a three-way battle for 
ownership of the media group, whose flagship is the tabloid Daily 
Mirror. Montgomery was forced out of his job earlier this year by 
Mirror shareholders unhappy with his performance. In trying to 
acquire the company, Montgomery would face challenges from regional 
newspaper group Trinity PLC and the privately backed Regional 
Independent Media PLC. Bids from those two companies are currently 
under investigation by the government's Competition Commission.

million pounds ($474 million) during the first six months of the 
year, an increase of 2 percent over the same period last year. The 
news and financial information provider said today that profits 
increased despite a slowdown in orders due to slower activity in 
foreign exchange markets, delays associated with the millennium bug 
and a larger interest expense. Reuters' pretax profit for the first 
half of last year was 294 million pounds ($459 million).

<HEADLINE> Enron Plans Oil and Gas Subsidiary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Continuing a trend of its movement away from  
exploration and production, Enron Corp. plans to spin off its oil 
and gas subsidiary in exchange for $600 million and the unit's 
China and India operations. 
</P>
<P>
	In the deal set to close Aug. 31, Enron Corp. will reduce its  
stake in Enron Oil and Gas Co. from about 82.27 million shares, or 
54 percent, to 20 million shares, or less than 17 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	All Enron officers currently on the EOG board of directors will  
resign their positions as EOG Resources Inc., as it will be called, 
becomes a major stand-alone independent producer. 
</P>
<P>
	``While EOG's North American operations are among the best in  
the industry, they are no longer strategic to Enron's North 
American energy businesses, as we have ready access to gas supplies 
in this well-developed market,'' Enron chairman Kenneth L. Lay said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than the Asian operations, which will support Enron's  
large presence there, Enron will be out of the exploration and 
production business. The company is concentrating on energy and 
communications marketing and other pursuits, such as facilities 
management. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Smith, an analyst at Dain Rauscher Wessel, called the  
deal a ``symbolic confirmation'' of Enron's evolution out of 
exploration and production. 
</P>
<P>
	Enron long has been expected to sell EOG, but talks last spring  
with an unidentified suitor never materialized. 
</P>
<P>
	``The transaction also will remove the uncertainty of our  
ownership status and will provide EOG with greater access to both 
debt and equity capital with which to grow its businesses,'' EOG 
chairman Forrest E. Hoglund said.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though EOG's operations will be limited to North America and  
Trinidad after the sale, spokesman A.H. Davis said it will continue 
to explore business opportunities worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	EOG primarily produces natural gas, though Davis said the  
company does operate some oil wells. 
</P>
<P>
	For Enron, the deal provides cash that can be used to pay down  
debt or invest in more profitable enterprises, Merrill Lynch 
analyst Donato J. Eassey said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to providing cash for Enron, the transaction also  
allows it to reduce exposure to oft-volatile oil and gas prices, 
Eassey said. 
</P>
<P>
	EOG this month reported second-quarter income of $12.9 million,  
or 8 cents a share, a slight dip from the same period last year but 
met analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in EOG leapt 68 3/4 to $20.43 3/4 in trading Tuesday on the New  
York Stock Exchange, while Enron was up 25 cents to $85.56 1/4.

<HEADLINE> Minor League Umps Issue Complaints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball's major and minor league umpires are in  
a muddled mess. 
</P>
<P>
	While some American League umpires are trying to rescind their  
resignations, disgruntled minor league umps postponed a decision on 
a strike date until today at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
	Two high-ranking baseball officials, speaking on the condition  
they not be identified, said Monday they were told some AL umpires 
either attempted to rescind their resignations or discussed the 
possibility with the AL office. 
</P>
<P>
	AL president Gene Budig declined comment. Umpires union head  
Richie Phillips said: ``You'll have to talk to them about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips said last week that 57 of the 68 major league umpires  
had resigned, effective Sept. 2, and that he expected most of the 
remaining nine members of his union to do the same. Two umpires who 
were hired during the 1979 strike are not union members. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips hasn't released a list of the umpires who are quitting.  
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Bud Selig isn't expected to respond to the  
resignations until perhaps later this week. His advisers said he 
will accept the resignations and instruct his staff to hire new 
umpires to complete the season and officiate the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires think that by walking out at the season's most critical  
time, they will put pressure on baseball to negotiate a new labor 
contract to replace the deal that expires Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Minor league umpires who claim to have formed a union --  
management has refused to recognize it -- didn't set a strike date 
during their two-hour conference call. Phillips said they will hold 
another conference call Tuesday, but he didn't know if a strike 
date would be set then. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked over a lot of issues,'' he said. ``As far as  
decisions and strategies, they deferred any decision until sometime 
(today).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nineteen umpires from 16 minor leagues, a group headed by Mike  
Billings of the Triple-A International League, issued a statement 
calling conditions ``deplorable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Minor League Umpires Union supports the major league  
umpires, but certainly does not exist for that purpose,'' said the 
statement, released by Phillips' office. 
</P>
<P>
	Billings said issues included salary: $4,500 for first-year  
umpires in Rookie League and $12,500 for starting umps at Triple-A. 
He compared that to the American Hockey League, which pays starting 
linesmen $41,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Minor league umps get $15-$20 in meal money, he said, a $2  
decrease from last year. AHL officials get $62 in meal and tip 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said that while AHL officials get private rooms at  
Marriotts and Hiltons, minor league umpires are ``ordered to sleep 
two to a room in second-rate motor lodges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pat O'Conner, a vice president with the National Association of  
Professional Baseball Leagues, the governing body of the minors, 
refuted some of Billings' complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are inaccuracies in the numbers that are designed to  
mislead public opinion,'' O'Conner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Triple-A umpires received an 11 percent increase in meal money  
and Double-A umps received just over 6 percent, he said, and that 
per diem was not cut at any level. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said minor league umpires in full-season leagues get  
year-round medical benefits, and that Rookie League umpires worked 
just 2 1/2 months a year. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the hotel room complaints, he said:  
</P>
<P>
	``We take particular exception, as we are sure our host cities  
do, to the references to `second-rate motels' where our umpires 
stay. Minor league baseball is played in 160 cities and towns 
across the country, many of them in grass-roots communities that do 
not have the benefit of luxury hotels.''

<HEADLINE> Bank One Earnings Up 11 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Bank One Corp., the nation's fifth-largest bank,  
reported an 11 percent increase in its second-quarter profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago-based company said Tuesday earnings were $992  
million, or 83 cents a share, for the second quarter ended June 30, 
compared with $895 million, or 75 cents a share, for last year's 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's second-quarter results included a one-time charge of  
$179 million, or 10 cents a share, to cover the cost of the merger 
between Banc One and First Chicago NBD. Excluding the charge, the 
results for the quarter ended June 30 matched Wall Street's 
forecast of 93 cents a share, according to a survey of analysts by 
First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	John McCoy, the company's president and CEO, attributed the  
solid quarter to ``strong revenue generation and disciplined 
expense management.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He cited the launch of the company's Internet-only bank,  
WingspanBank, as one of the highlights of the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors, however, sent Bank One's stock down 87 1/2 cents to  
$59.65 1/4 a share in midafternoon trading on the New York Stock 
Exchange. All of the major stock indexes were off Tuesday as 
Microsoft's forecast of slower revenue growth in the coming year 
depressed technology shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank One's revenue from credit cards jumped 33 percent, from  
$630 million to $920 million, partly due to more transactions, the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company posted revenues of $4.56 billion, up slightly from  
$4.47 billion in the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first half of the year, Bank One earned $2.14 billion,  
or $1.79 a share, up from $1.83 billion, or $1.53 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues were $9.46 billion vs. $8.70 billion.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Fight Against Racism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Drawing yet again from President Kennedy's  
legacy, President Clinton today challenged the nation's lawyers to 
diversify their ranks and devote more time to fighting racism 
through pro bono work. 
</P>
<P>
	The president was gathering leaders from various aspects of law,  
such as bar associations, corporation counsels, law firms and civil 
rights attorneys, to issue a ``call to action'' as part of his 
efforts to promote racial dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's event was patterned after a call Kennedy issued in the  
White House East Room on June 21, 1963, before 200 lawyers, urging 
them to condemn Gov. George Wallace's stand against allowing black 
students to enroll in Alabama's public universities. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy was joined by his brother, Attorney General Robert F.  
Kennedy and Vice President Lyndon Johnson, who succeeded Kennedy 
and implemented the ``Great Society'' programs that sought to 
address entrenched poverty, especially among minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Before convening that meeting, Kennedy cast his effort as an  
attempt to prod Americans to take up the battle for racial 
equality. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are confronted, primarily, with a moral issue. It is as old  
as the Scriptures and is as clear as the American Constitution,'' 
Kennedy said. ``The heart of the question is whether all Americans 
are to be afforded equal rights and equal opportunities, whether we 
are going to treat our fellow Americans as we want to be treated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton was  
commemorating the anniversary of Kennedy's call by standing in the 
same room, picking up on his predecessor's desire for the legal 
community ``to get involved with using their skills to eradicate 
racism in this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton planned to announce a series of commitments on promoting  
opportunities for minorities in the legal profession. The 
commitments were worked out among the White House, Justice 
Department, bar associations, law schools and private sector 
attorneys over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	Under those commitments:  
</P>
<P>
	--The American Bar Association will expand programs for  
corporations to hire more minority law firms, encourage more 
lawyers to provide free legal services to the poor and provide 
financial and mentoring assistance to minority law students. 
</P>
<P>
	--The American Corporate Counsel Association will promote  
corporate pro bono services and provide resources so that corporate 
counsels can implement diversity and pro bono services on the local 
level. 
</P>
<P>
	--Some leading law firms will agree to have their attorneys  
commit to spending 50 hours per year, or 3 percent of billable 
time, performing pro bono services for nonwhites or working in 
disadvantaged neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	--The American Association of Law Schools will promote lessons in  
racial justice and public service and encourage students to 
volunteer in minority communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the ABA and ACCA will join with the National Bar  
Association, Hispanic National Bar Association, Native American Bar 
Association, National Asian Pacific American Bar Association, 
Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights and the San Francisco and New 
York City bars to develop a national response to Clinton's call.

<HEADLINE> Minnesota Resumes Search For Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The University of Minnesota, looking to replace  
former men's basketball coach Clem Haskins, has received permission 
to interview Rice coach Willis Wilson and Gonzaga coach Dan Monson. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not clear whether Wilson is even interested in leaving  
Rice, which finished 18-10 last season and has seen its 
once-stagnant program revived. The school's athletic director, 
Bobby May, said he was trying to reach the coach, who was 
traveling. 
</P>
<P>
	While May said he believes Wilson would be an excellent choice  
if he accepted the Minnesota job, he admits the timing would be bad 
for Rice. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be terrible to lose our coach at this time of year,''  
he said, alluding to the difficulty of finding a replacement with 
the upcoming season looming. 
</P>
<P>
	Monson, who was in California on a recruiting trip, is not  
actively looking at the Minnesota job, but will talk to Golden 
Gophers officials if he can fit them into his recruiting schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Haskins resigned after last season in the wake of an academic  
fraud scandal.

<HEADLINE> Cone Comes Back to Stadium As a Hero </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- David Letterman asked for him. So did Regis and  
Kathie Lee. The Hall of Fame called, and umpires sent over some 
balls to be signed. 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone wanted David Cone on Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was completely disoriented for a period of time,'' the New  
York Yankees ace said. ``I probably still am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cone took away just one memento from his perfect game Sunday  
against Montreal. He kept the final ball, and plans to give it to 
his dad. 
</P>
<P>
	Cone's jersey will end up in Cooperstown once it's presented to  
Hall of Fame representatives on Aug. 3 before a game against 
Toronto. Other souvenirs from his first no-hitter since a 
seven-inning job in Little League -- and the 14th perfect game in 
modern history -- will go to help charities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always been leery about signing autographs for money,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cone arrived at Yankee Stadium about 3 1/2 hours before Monday's  
game against the Expos and found his locker full of flowers, 
balloons and telegrams. Former Mets teammate John Franco sent a 
bottle of champagne. 
</P>
<P>
	After talking to fellow perfect-game pitcher David Wells in  
Toronto following his gem, Cone spent the night out toasting with 
Derek Jeter, Tino Martinez and Chuck Knoblauch. He talked with his 
family back in Kansas City -- his father listened to the final 
innings on the radio, via the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	All the activity on Yogi Berra Day -- Don Larsen, who pitched a  
perfect game at Yankee Stadium in the 1956 World Series, threw out 
the ceremonial first ball -- left Cone a bit ``frazzled,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He wanted to enjoy everything, up to a point.  
</P>
<P>
	``The last thing I want to do is go out and live it up and then  
get my butt kicked by Cleveland on Friday night,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cone pitched his first shutout since blanking Minnesota exactly  
four years earlier on July 18, 1995. He never went to a three-ball 
count. He struck out 10, featuring a nasty, sharp slider he said 
was aided by a ``cross-wind at home plate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At age 36 and having pitched nearly 3,200 innings in his pro  
career, he proved to himself and all others there was still plenty 
left in his right arm. The win made him 10-4 with a 2.65 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, it sort of symbolizes I've come full circle,'' Cone  
said. ``From being traded by the Mets, to the arterial bypass and 
aneurysm and people wondering when my arm would fall off. 
</P>
<P>
	``Going into every spring training, I'm wondering how much I  
have left, how many pitches do I have left?'' he said. ``I think 
all the questions are valid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His newly found reliance on acupuncture and deep-tissue massage  
has helped, as do other tricks -- he applied ``Red Hot'' balm to his 
arm to keep it warm before pitching the ninth inning Sunday. He 
also paced in the laundry room inside the clubhouse, just to keep 
loose. 
</P>
<P>
	``The radio was on and I heard `perfect game' about 100 times,''  
he said. ``Believe me, there's nothing to that jinx.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cone praised outstanding plays by right fielder Paul O'Neill and  
second baseman Chuck Knoblauch. He also complimented left fielder 
Ricky Ledee's ``juggling act'' on a fly ball in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never saw it,'' Ledee said. ``There was all that glare out  
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Third baseman Scott Brosius caught Orlando Cabrera's foul popup  
for the final out. One footnote: If Brosius had dropped the foul 
ball for an error, and then Cone had retired Cabrera, it would have 
counted as a perfect game. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as it went up, I was like, `He's got it!''' Brosius  
said. ``Then, I was like, `I better get it!''' 
</P>
<P>
	Kidded Cone: ``I was kind of dumbfounded, pointing at the ball  
like no one saw it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees owner George Steinbrenner called Cone the ``spirit  
leader'' of the team, adding ``maybe there's something to this 
Yankee mystique.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said manager Joe Torre: ``There's something about Yankee  
Old-Timers days or any time these things go on at the Stadium where 
it seems to shake the spirits loose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cone was well aware of that magic. It's part of the reason he  
signed a one-year contract and stayed with the Yankees, rather than 
seeking more lucrative deals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to leave,'' he said. ``I know there's always a  
chance to have a game like I did yesterday. I know if you do it 
here it's more significant. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pitched on Yogi Berra Day. I pitched on Joe DiMaggio Day.  
And I pitched on the day Mickey Mantle died,'' he said. ''That just 
doesn't happen anywhere else.''

<HEADLINE> United States 90, Brazil 73 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- According to Jason Kidd, Brazil is  
the They Must Be Dreaming Team. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil gave the United States its first scare of the Olympic  
qualifying tournament Tuesday night, pulling within three points 
early in the second half before losing 90-73. So well did the 
Brazilians play that they said afterward that the American team 
might actually be beatable. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a dream,'' Kidd said, ``so hopefully they'll sleep good  
tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rest assured that the Brazilians did sleep contentedly after  
giving the U.S. team its toughest test since the gold medal match 
against Yugoslavia in the 1996 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil, which came out more energized than the Americans and  
stayed that way into the second half, closed within seven points by 
opening the final 20 minutes with a 3-pointer by Rogerio Klafke. 
</P>
<P>
	After a jumper by Allan Houston, Klafke made a reverse layup to  
make it 48-41. 
</P>
<P>
	Michel Ferreira hit two foul shots with 17:13 left to make it a  
five-point game, and Ciao DeMello hit two free throws after a 
technical foul on Gary Payton to make it 48-45 with 16:41 left. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't even realize it was three points,'' Kidd said.  
``That's how closely I was paying attention to the scoreboard. Here 
you've just got to play through the bad times. You're not going to 
play perfect every night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Smith, Tim Duncan and Houston broke the United States out  
of its lethargy, combining for all but two points in a 30-11 run 
that gave the Americans a 78-56 lead with 7 minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan finished with 24 points, 12 rebounds and three blocks,  
Smith had four 3-pointers and 18 points and Houston scored 13 as 
the United States, playing before a sparse crowd that appeared to 
be less than 2,000, won its sixth game of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel we won the game,'' assistant coach Enio Vecchi said.  
``We're proud of the work we did, we were consistent, we hit shots, 
we played better. We have a history of playing well against teams 
like the United States and Yugoslavia, and in this game we did it 
again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Brazil trailing by just three points and the crowd sensing  
something special might be happening, the Americans started to bear 
down. Duncan hit two free throws, Houston dunked off a steal, 
Duncan hit two more from the line, Smith scored on a putback and 
Duncan hit a bank shot. 
</P>
<P>
	That 10-0 run took less than 2 minutes, making it 58-45, and  
Brazil got its deficit back into single digits on a foul shot by 
Klafke with 13:49 left. 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan followed with a putback, and Houston and Smith hit  
3-pointers for a 17-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the type of game that was good for us,'' Smith said.  
``We might have come in a little bit too confident that we can beat 
everybody by a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Kidd: ``We came out and felt we were going to blow Brazil  
away. But they shot the ball well. It seemed like they made all of 
them in the first half.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith later scored eight straight points for the Americans,  
including two more 3-pointers to bump the lead to 22. The United 
States eventually led by as many as 25. 
</P>
<P>
	``In order to beat the Dream Team, we'd have to be very lucky,  
and they would have to have a very, very bad day,'' Brazilian guard 
Demetrius Conrado said. 
</P>
<P>
	Told afterward that the Brazilians no longer feel it's  
impossible to beat the Americans, the U.S. players had a chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It still is,'' Houston said.  
</P>
<P>
	In other games, Argentina surprised Puerto Rico 101-96, handing  
the host team its first loss of the tournament and setting up a 
crucial game Wednesday for the Puerto Ricans against Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Rico needs to beat Canada by more than four points in  
order to avoid facing the United States in the semifinals, when two 
Olympic berths will be at stake. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada defeated the Dominican Republic 81-64 and Venezuela  
defeated Uruguay 87-84. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States plays Venezuela tonight and Puerto Rico on  
Thursday.

<HEADLINE>  Minor Leaguers at Pan Am Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- The U.S. Pan Am baseball team is hardly the  
juggernaut envisioned when international competition was opened to 
professionals for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	If they get a boost in the Pan American Games, it probably will  
come from players who resemble the Kevin Costner character in 
``Bull Durham'' -- veterans achingly close to getting back to the 
majors. 
</P>
<P>
	Former big leaguers like Craig Paquette, Shawn Gilbert, Charlie  
Greene and Jason Hardtke were selected for their leadership and 
experience, manager Buddy Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a necessity to have guys that play with a high sense of  
energy and guys that really understand what this is about,'' he 
said. ``I think that the older you become, the more you understand 
the importance of this type of tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the sports governing body decided to allow professionals  
at the top international level, major league owners decided only 
those players not on 40-man major league rosters could compete. 
That meant veterans, plus prospects with fewer than three 
professional seasons who didn't have to be protected on the 40-man 
roster for last December's major league draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans must finish first or second in the nine-nation Pan  
Am tournament to qualify for the Olympics. Competition starts 
Sunday and ends Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is reason for concern.  
</P>
<P>
	The Americans came out of a warmup tournament in Tucson with a  
2-2 record, losing to the Dominican Republic 10-3 Saturday and 5-1 
Monday. The Dominicans don't have the reputation of Cuba, which has 
won nine Pan Am Games championships in 12 competitions since 1951. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a sense of urgency for sure,'' said Arizona  
Diamondbacks Double-A pitcher John Patterson. ``Every night, you've 
got to go out and have your `A' game, and we're not wanting to just 
play. We don't want a medal; we want the gold medal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	College players earned the United States its only Pan Am gold in  
1967 and took silver medals by finishing second to Cuba in 1951, 
1963, 1971, 1975 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and Cuba are in the same division this year.  
The Americans begin play Monday against Canada, followed on 
successive days by Mexico, Cuba and Brazil. The Dominican Republic, 
Guatemala, Panama and Nicaragua are in the other division. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight teams advance from the first round and will be reseeded  
for the quarterfinals, which start July 31. Then, the format is 
single elimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell, the Detroit Tigers' manager from 1996-98 and Cincinnati's  
minor league coordinator, has been stressing the format of the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like the seventh game of the World Series,'' Gilbert  
said. ``How they explained it to us is that you have to get to the 
final game to be a part of the Olympics, and I think we realize 
that now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gilbert, a 34-year-old outfielder, signed with Los Angeles this  
year after playing in 36 major league games with the New York Mets 
and St. Louis Cardinals. Currently at the Triple-A level in the 
Dodgers' organization, he is the oldest player on the roster. 
</P>
<P>
	``The older guys, those are the guys who are going to step up  
for you and get the younger guys to step up too,'' said left-hander 
Mark Mulder, a Triple-A pitcher for Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene, a catcher, with 20 major league games under his belt  
with the New York Mets and Baltimore Orioles, concurred. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playing for your country and playing for the Olympics, it  
should bring out the best in us,'' he said. ``We've got some guys 
that have quality big league time, and that's playing at the 
highest level. There's no surprises for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange, Greene, who won an International Baseball  
Association gold medal at the 1989 World Junior Championships, 
hopes his current team, the Milwaukee Brewers, keeps its promise to 
keep an eye on his progress. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was part of the agreement -- that they would keep tabs on  
us and that the people here would send reports back on us, because 
we're still the property of them and they're still in charge of 
us,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Rape Trial Begins for Druckenmiller </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHRISTIANSBURG, Va. (AP) -- A woman who contends pro football  
player Jim Druckenmiller raped her while she was too drunk to stop 
him had consumed enough alcohol to render her unconscious that 
night, a witness testified Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3:10 p.m. on March 4, about 12 hours after the alleged  
attack, the woman had a blood-alcohol level of .07 percent, said 
Dr. James Valentour, the state's chief of forensic toxicology. 
Under state law, a person with a level of .08 percent is considered 
intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
	With a level so high that long after drinking, the woman's blood  
alcohol level would have ranged from .25 percent to .33 percent at 
the time of the alleged attack and could have caused her to pass 
out, Valentour said during testimony for the prosecution in 
Druckenmiller's rape trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Cris Whitaker, a forensic nurse, said the woman had bruises and  
abrasions that are typical of rough sex. Under cross-examination by 
defense lawyers, Whitaker acknowledged the victim could have been 
injured by the string of a tampon she was wearing during sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Druckenmiller, a backup quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers,  
is accused of forcing sex on a 21-year-old Virginia Tech student 
who passed out at a party in Blacksburg, where the school is 
located. The woman said she awoke to find the 6-foot-4, 240-pound 
football player on top of her. 
</P>
<P>
	Druckenmiller, a former star quarterback for the Hokies, faces  
five years to life in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Melanie D'Amico, a member of the same sorority as the alleged  
victim, said the woman already was sick from too much drinking and 
vomited when they got to the party. She said Druckenmiller helped 
her put the woman, who was fully clothed, into a bed, and they left 
the woman in the room alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Cindy Barnette, a hospital emergency room nurse who treated and  
examined the woman, said the woman told her she recalled nothing 
from the time she and several friends left a Blacksburg-area bar 
together until she awoke with Druckenmiller. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnette said she asked the woman, ``Did you scream or yell for  
help, and she said, `No, I just let him finish.''' 
</P>
<P>
	In opening statements Tuesday, Druckenmiller's lawyer, Deborah  
Caldwell-Bono, said the woman had consensual sex with 
Druckenmiller. ``The evidence will show that she yelled `get out' 
when her friends tried to get in the bedroom,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under cross-examination by Caldwell-Bono, Barnette said the  
woman chose to file charges after being told that rape examinations 
cost $1,800 for people who do not file charges but are free for 
women who take the case to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnette also said the woman was concerned about publicity that  
the case would get and because she had been seen dancing with and 
kissing Druckenmiller earlier that night. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast to Caldwell-Bono's opening statement, Barnette  
testified that the woman told her it was Druckenmiller, not her, 
who told someone attempting to enter the bedroom to go away. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial is expected to last the rest of the week.  
</P>
<P>
	Druckenmiller is due in the 49ers training camp Monday.

<HEADLINE> David Cone Gets Key to City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York Yankee David Cone, who pitched the 14th  
perfect game in modern baseball history, collected his third key to 
the city Tuesday. The mayor threw in a key chain to make sure they 
don't get lost. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani told Cone that New Yorkers are ``all  
living in the reflected glory'' of his 6-0 masterpiece against the 
Montreal Expos on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cone got his other keys after the Yankees won the World Series  
in 1996 and 1998. He told 250 people packed into City Hall that 
players appreciate Giuliani's exuberant support of the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Mayor, on behalf of all the Yankee players, how happy we  
are to have you as a fan, and how your sincerity as a Yankee fan 
really comes across,'' Cone said. ``There's a lot of politicians 
who say that they're true baseball fans.''

<HEADLINE> California Enacts Tough New Gun Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- As relatives of people slain by assault  
weapons watched, Gov. Gray Davis signed into law the nation's 
toughest ban on military-type guns and a measure to limit buyers to 
one handgun per month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guns have a place in the theater of war, they have no place  
out on the streets,'' Davis said Monday during a ceremony six years 
after eight people were killed in a rampage at a San Francisco 
office building. 
</P>
<P>
	The new law closes loopholes in the state's 1989 assault weapons  
law by spelling out the physical characteristics of banned weapons, 
such as fixed magazines that carry more than 10 rounds of 
ammunition and other features that allow rapid firing. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the old law, the sale, manufacture, import and often the  
possession of more than 50 military-style weapons was prohibited. 
But gun makers got around that by making slight modifications and 
selling ``copycat'' weapons under different names. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, while the TEC-9 semiautomatic pistol has been  
illegal, the similar TEC-DC9 remained legal in California. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm feeling a lot of happiness, but still a great deal of  
sadness for the lives that had to be taken to make this possible,'' 
said Carol Kingsley, whose husband, Jack Berman, was among those 
gunned down during the 1993 killing spree by a man armed with an 
assault weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	The new law goes into effect Jan. 1.  
</P>
<P>
	Marilyn Merrill, whose husband Mike was killed, attended the  
ceremony with her 10-year-old daughter Kristen. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be many lives saved by this law,'' she said. ``I  
don't want anyone to have to go through (a massacre) again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, three months after 13 people were gunned down at  
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., only a few states have 
put more control on guns. Most states did nothing. Some even 
loosened gun restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Rifle Association downplayed the potential effects  
of the California measure, saying all guns covered by the bill 
could simply have parts removed to make them legal. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is all about elections,'' NRA state liaison Steve Helsley  
said. ``This is all about political positioning. This is not a gun 
ban.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis campaigned extensively in support of gun control laws  
during his 1998 bid for the governorship after former Gov. Pete 
Wilson vetoed several gun control bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Monday, Davis signed another bill intended to stop gun  
traffickers by limiting gun buyers to no more than one handgun per 
month. The law provides penalties of up to one year in jail, a fine 
of $1,000 or both. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents said criminals could still get guns.

<HEADLINE> Reuters' 6-Mo. Earnings Up 2 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Reuters Group PLC's pretax profit rose to 300  
million pounds ($474 million) during the first six months of the 
year, an increase of 2 percent over the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The news and financial information provider said Tuesday that  
profits increased despite a slowdown in orders due to slower 
activity in foreign exchange markets, delays associated with the 
millennium bug and a larger interest expense. Reuters' pretax 
profit for the first half of last year was 294 million pounds ($459 
million). 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose over the same period to 1.56 billion pounds ($2.4  
billion) from 1.45 billion pounds ($2.2 billion). 
</P>
<P>
	More vigorous efforts to contain costs helped boost revenues and  
profits at the group's largest division, Reuters Information, the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, increased investment and the costs associated with the  
introduction of Europe's regional currency, the euro, are expected 
to continue depressing results for the group's second largest 
business, Reuters Trading Systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The Greenhouse Fund, part of the new Reuters Ventures division,  
earned a semiannual profit of 29 million pounds ($45 million) from 
its investments in mainly Internet-related ventures.

<HEADLINE> E. Timor's Future May Lie in Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Locked beneath the strip of sea  
separating Australia and the island of Timor is enough oil and gas 
to fuel a small nation. 
</P>
<P>
	If East Timor, the restive territory covering half of the  
island, breaks away from Indonesia and becomes a new nation, 
perhaps as soon as next year, its political leaders will be looking 
to do just that. 
</P>
<P>
	Securing peace in the territory -- wracked by violence between  
separatists and the Indonesian army for 23 years, and more recently 
by anti-independence militias -- is one essential element to 
establishing a new nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Another will be finding revenues to bolster what is now a small  
agrarian economy and to replace government funds that come from the 
faraway Indonesian capital of Jakarta. 
</P>
<P>
	First, the East Timorese must decide on an Indonesian offer of  
greater autonomy for their territory in a U.N.-sponsored referendum 
now planned for Aug. 21 or 22. President B.J. Habibie says 
Indonesia will let East Timor go if the offer is rejected. 
</P>
<P>
	``East Timor will have a heavy dependence on oil revenues and  
foreign aid'' if it chooses independence, said Michael van 
Langenberg of Sydney University's School of Southeast Asian 
Studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Portugal, the former colonial ruler, Australia, Brazil and other  
nations have pledged aid if East Timor does become independent. 
</P>
<P>
	Going it alone would mean wading into complicated commercial  
matters. Exploration and exploitation rights for the Timor Gap, an 
international zone that falls between the territorial waters of 
Australia and Timor, is governed by a complex treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	The pact was signed in 1989 after more than two decades of  
negotiations between Australia and Indonesia, made possible only by 
Australia's 1976 decision to recognize Indonesian sovereignty over 
East Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia invaded the former Portugese colony in 1975 and  
annexed it the following year. The United Nations and most 
countries still recognize Portugal as the administering power. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite covering only oil and not natural gas, which is  
increasingly being found in the region, the Timor Gap treaty was 
welcomed by resource companies and exploration has boomed. 
</P>
<P>
	Current production is small, but Australian officials say the  
region is one of the richest new hydrocarbon areas outside the 
Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated $2.1 billion has been spent to explore and tap the  
oil pools so far. Industry insiders estimate the region holds the 
potential for producing $11 billion in revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	The boundaries under the treaty form a coffin-shaped zone that  
divides administration and ownership among two national and two 
state governments. 
</P>
<P>
	The northern part is administered by Indonesia, with Australia  
holding rights to 10 percent of royalties on any oil found. The 
southern part is administered by two Australian state governments, 
with Indonesia having 10 percent royalty rights. 
</P>
<P>
	In between is a 23,552-square-mile ``zone of cooperation''  
administered jointly by Australia and Indonesia, where royalties on 
any oil found are split 50-50. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips Petroleum Co., based in Bartlesville, Okla., currently  
pumps 33,000 barrels of oil a day from its Elang, Kakatua and 
Kakatua North oil fields and has rights to exploit other fields in 
the Australian zone and the zone of cooperation, including the 
Bayu-Undan gas field, which is due to be in production by early 
2003. 
</P>
<P>
	The Australian company Woodside Petroleum Ltd. expects its $890  
million Laminaria-Corallina oil project to be producing by the end 
of this year, its corporate affairs manager, Geoff Wedgwood, said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least seven other finds have been made.  
</P>
<P>
	The foreign ministers of Indonesia and Australia have agreed  
that at least some aspects of the treaty will have to be 
renegotiated if East Timor becomes independent. 
</P>
<P>
	Jailed resistance leader Jose Alexandre Gusmao and Nobel Peace  
Prize laureate Jose Ramos Horta, expected to be key players in any 
new East Timorese government, want East Timor to replace Indonesia 
as signatory to the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	``If East Timor becomes independent, Indonesia ceases to be the  
other signatory. Timor would have to be signatory, without changing 
the content of the treaty,'' Ramos Horta said earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say it might be years before royalties are enough to  
contribute significantly to the economy of an independent East 
Timor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Timor Gap treaty will have no impact for probably a  
decade,'' said Scott Burchill, senior lecturer in international 
relations at Deakin University. ``But it will play a major role in 
East Timor's economic development when it comes on stream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The oil companies are most interested in stability and  
continuity. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue of independence for East Timor is a matter of  
international law and resolution between governments,'' said 
Wedgwood. ``But if there is no logical and consistent regime in 
place, people will be reluctant to spend large amounts of money in 
the region.''

<HEADLINE> Airline Earnings Take Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Northwest Airlines reported Tuesday its earnings more than  
doubled in the second quarter as it continued its recovery from 
labor problems, and Southwest Airlines and America West also 
reported earnings gains. 
</P>
<P>
	A look at the companies' results:  

</P>
<P>
                        *Northwest Airlines    	
</P>
<P>
	The nation's sixth-largest airline in terms of passengers  
carried reported earnings of $120 million, or $1.29 per share, 
compared with $49 million, or 51 cents a share, in the same period 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Results for the 1999 quarter included a one-time credit of $17  
million after taxes, while in the year-earlier period, Northwest 
had a one-time charge of $42 million after taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest's earnings exceeded the $1.01 per share expected by  
analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating revenues increased nearly 5 percent to $2.60 billion  
from $2.48 billion in the second quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor problems depressed Northwest's second-quarter earnings  
last year as some pilots and mechanics began work slowdowns to 
protest a lack of progress in contract talks. The slowdowns caused 
increased delays and flight cancellations. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots also struck for 15 days in September, during the third  
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	With most of its labor troubles over, Eagan, Minn.-based  
Northwest has significantly improved its operations, president and 
chief executive John Dasburg said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first half, Northwest's earnings dropped 24 percent to  
$91 million, or 98 cents a share, from $120 million, or $1.17 a 
share, last year. 
</P>
<P>
	First-half earnings were affected by the residual effects of the  
labor problems. Northwest earned $91 million, or 98 cents per 
share, down from $120 million, or $1.17 a share, in the first half 
of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	First-half revenue was down slightly to $4.88 billion, from  
$4.90 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest shares rose 31 1/4 cents to $33.87 1/2 in trading on the New  
York Stock Exchange. 

</P>
<P>
                        *Southwest Airlines    	
</P>
<P>
	The nation's fourth-largest airline said it earned $157.8  
million, or 29 cents per share, up from $133.4 million, or 25 cents 
per share, for the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues were $1.22 billion, up 13.1 percent from $1.08 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite the strong earnings gain, Southwest's results were a  
penny below the expectations of analysts surveyed by First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	An increase in passengers, drawn by the airline's low ticket  
prices, contributed to its gains. The company said its load factor, 
the industry term for the number of seats filled on its planes, 
rose 2.9 percent to 73.1 percent during the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months, Dallas-based Southwest reported  
earnings of $253.6 million, or 47 cents per share, up from $203.4 
million, or 38 cents per share, in the first six months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues came to $2.3 billion, up from $2.02 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Southwest shares fell $1.58 to $20.37 1/2 in trading on the New  
York Stock Exchange. 

</P>
<P>
                     *America West Holdings Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	The parent of America West, the nation's ninth-largest airline,  
reported earnings of $42.3 million, or $1.06 per share, up from 
$41.4 million, or 86 cents per share, in the same period a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues came to $ 569.5 million, up from $533.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	The results were well ahead of the 90 cents per share predicted  
by analysts surveyed by First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	America West's earnings reflected a $2.7 million pre-tax gain on  
the sale of its stock in Priceline.com, an online service that 
sells airline tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said its earnings rose despite an increase in  
expenses at America West Airline, including costs related to 
prevention of Year 2000 computer problems and higher fuel prices. 
The airline's revenue rose to $554.2 million from $519.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Leisure Co., a travel service also owned by the parent  
company, reported second-quarter revenues of $65.6 million, up from 
$50.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months, America West had earnings of $68.2  
million, or $1.68 per share, up from $66.6 million, or $1.38 per 
share, in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues came to $1.09 billion, up from $1.02 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	America West's shares rose 18 3/4 cents to $20.93 3/4 in trading on  
the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Lower; Dow Down 191.55 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks dropped sharply today as investors who  
pumped up their portfolios on the promise of strong corporate 
earnings began selling to capture profits. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was down 191.55 at 10,996.13. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Nasdaq composite  
index, dominated by technology issues, had its steepest point loss 
since April 19, when the index dropped 138.43 points. As of 
Monday's close, the Nasdaq had gained more than 28 percent so far 
in 1999, and analysts said the index was poised for a selloff. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 30.55 to 1,377.10, and the Nasdaq  
composite index dropped 98.04 to 2,732.25. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 11-to-5 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, with 2,050 down, 897 up and 584 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 752.02 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
636.70 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 11.30 to 647.27, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 11.76 to 805.90. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 7.82 to 453.55.  
</P>
<P>
	As the second-quarter earnings reporting season continues,  
companies are turning in impressive profit figures. Stocks that 
comprise the S&AMP;P 500 are on track for their strongest profit growth 
since the third quarter of 1997, according to First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, a trio of Dow components -- Johnson &AMP; Johnson, General  
Motors and United Technologies -- reported earnings that beat Wall 
Street estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	But with major market indexes close to record levels, few big  
companies have managed any significant bounce from their strong 
earnings. Johnson &AMP; Johnson and United Technologies rose modestly, 
and GM slipped. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a sparkling rally,'' said Joseph V. Battipaglia,  
chief investment strategist at Gruntal &AMP; Co. in New York. ``While 
there's been no disappointments, there has been some room for 
short-term selling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street's high expectations for corporate profits have  
created a punishing climate for any companies that offer even a 
hint of weakness. Microsoft fell sharply today, after announcing 
late Monday it expects revenue growth to slow in fiscal year 2000, 
which began July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft beat earnings estimates by 4 cents per share in its  
fiscal fourth quarter. But the company's chief financial officer 
warned its stellar rate of growth will be difficult to sustain as 
personal computer sales slow, Year 2000 computer problems linger 
and Microsoft makes hefty investments in new arenas. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts discounted the cautious revenue forecast, saying the  
selloff was due almost entirely to profit-taking. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, we believe that business conditions remain extremely  
solid for Microsoft,'' said Neil J. Herman, an analyst with Salomon 
Smith Barney. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM had a similar fate, plunging and contributing most heavily  
to the Dow's losses. Big Blue said after the market closed Monday 
that its second-quarter profits jumped 65 percent, beating 
analysts' expectations by 3 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts said that because shares of IBM have risen more  
than 40 percent so far this year, investors are reluctant to build 
up their positions in the stock. 
</P>
<P>
	``The embodiment of this latest rally has been the technology  
stocks,'' said Battipaglia. ``So it's not surprising that that's 
where the sharpest profit-taking is happening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the market's steep losses, some new issues thrived  
today. Genentech, a biotechnology company partially spun off by 
Swiss pharmaceutical Roche, was priced at 97 and rose to 128 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of technology-related stocks rose above the Nasdaq's  
weakness in strong initial public offerings. Gadzoox Networks Inc. 
was offered at 21, opened at 68 a share, and rose as high as 87.

<HEADLINE> J &AMP; J Developing New Contraceptive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The biggest maker of birth control pills is  
developing a patch that delivers contraceptives through the skin 
and lasts a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson &AMP; Johnson said Tuesday the patches include the same  
ingredients as the pill and work just as well. J&AMP;J plans to seek 
government approval early next year. A review by the Food and Drug 
Administration could take a year or more. 
</P>
<P>
	J &AMP; J, which controls 39 percent of the oral contraceptives  
market, is in the final stages of testing the patch in several 
hundred women. The adhesive patch, which J&AMP;J calls Evra, is the 
size of a half-dollar and can be worn on an arm -- or for those who 
want to keep it hidden, the abdomen or buttocks. It would be the 
newest type of birth control to hit the U.S. market since the 
injectible drug Depo-Provera in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our patients said they were very satisfied with it,'' said  
Sally Ward, clinical services director of Planned Parenthood of 
Minnesota and South Dakota, which took part in testing earlier this 
year. About 25 women used the patch for six months, ending earlier 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The patients all thought positively about it, and look forward  
to having the patch on the market,'' Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
	Family planning groups said women would welcome another option  
in trying to prevent wanted pregnancies. 
</P>
<P>
	``For women who have difficulty remembering to take birth  
control pills, this is an excellent method,'' said Gloria Feldt, 
president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. 
</P>
<P>
	One drawback is that the patch must adhere to the skin, which  
could be difficult for women who sweat a lot or take frequent 
showers. It also might cause some skin irritation. 
</P>
<P>
	Eileen Harris, 32, of New York, who has taken birth control  
pills for five years, said she wasn't interested. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why would I want to walk around with a patch all day, if I  
could take a pill in the morning and be done with it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Amy, another New Yorker who would only give her first name, was  
interested. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I could hide it, I would use it,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Patches are already used to deliver a variety of other drugs,  
from anti-smoking treatments to estrogen replacement for 
post-menopausal women. While the pill can cause nausea and vomiting 
in some women, the patch can reduce those side effects because the 
drugs don't pass through the digestive system. 
</P>
<P>
	By delivering a steady flow of drugs over an extended period of  
time, the patches can avoid the ``peak and valley'' effect of pills 
or injections, also reducing side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	Theoretically, the patch would be easier for women to use  
because they would not have to remember each day to take a pill. 
Birth control pills are nearly 99 percent effective at preventing 
pregnancy when taken appropriately, family planning experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	However, studies have shown up to 20 percent of teens using  
birth control pills forget to take them at least twice a month, 
said Dr. Elof Johansson, vice president of the Population Council, 
a New York-based reproductive health research group. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big advantage with the patch is it will increase  
compliance,'' said Johansson, whose group is also developing a 
contraceptive patch. That research, being done with Irish drug 
maker Elan Corp., is in early stages of human testing. 
</P>
<P>
	J&AMP;J is working on its patch with Redwood City, Calif.-based  
Cygnus, which specializes in developing drugs that are delivered 
through the skin. 
</P>
<P>
	About 10.4 million U.S. women currently use birth control pills  
and it is by far the most common form of birth control after 
sterilization, which is usually irreversible. 
</P>
<P>
	J&AMP;J, the New Brunswick, N.J.-based health care conglomerate most  
known for selling Band-Aids and Tylenol, revealed its work on the 
patch at a meeting of securities analysts in New York on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The contraceptive patch is expected to be among several new  
birth control options to become available in the United States in 
the next three years. One is a new intrauterine device that can 
prevent pregnancy for up to five years. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. corporations have generally been reluctant to market new  
types of birth control pills because of fears of lawsuits that have 
plagued previous products such as the Dalkon Shield and Norplant, 
which is made up of capsules inserted under the skin of the 
forearm, but has been linked to ovarian cysts and which has proven 
difficult for doctors to remove.

<HEADLINE> SBC, Ameritech Top Profit Forecasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SBC Communications and merger partner Ameritech topped Wall  
Street forecasts for the second quarter Tuesday, with both Baby 
Bell telephone companies showing double-digit profit growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Second-quarter profits grew 15 percent at SBC as the regional  
phone company serving the Southwest and California enjoyed strong 
demand for wireless and high-speed data services. 
</P>
<P>
	Ameritech, which serves the Midwest, had a 21 percent jump in  
operating profits, fueled by growth in high-speed connections and 
premium phone services such as caller ID and voice messaging. 

</P>
<P>
 *SBC Communications    	
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio-based SBC's earnings for the April-to-June quarter  
totaled $1.18 billion, or 59 cents per share, up from $1.02 
billion, or 51 cents per share, in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Second-quarter revenues grew to $7.40 billion, an increase of  
5.3 percent from $7.03 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from data services, including the high-speed Internet  
link known as digital subscriber line or DSL, increased 32 percent 
to $710 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Wireless revenues grew nearly 18 percent to $1.23 billion as  
SBC's subscriber tally grew by 305,000 to 7.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of SBC rose more than 2 percent after the report, which  
edged analyst forecasts for a per-share profit of 58 cents, 
according to a survey by First Call. In trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange, SBC was up $1.62 1/4 per share at $58.12 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward E. Whitacre Jr., chairman and chief executive, said SBC  
expects to complete its heavily contested acquisition of Ameritech 
during the current quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is still awaiting regulatory approvals from a variety  
of federal and state regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Ohio Public Utilities Commission approved the merger  
in April, regulators in Illinois, Indiana and Nevada are continuing 
to review the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the Federal Communications Commission gave a  
tentative nod after SBC and Ameritech agreed to specific conditions 
promoting competition in local phone service. Among other things, 
the companies agreed to start selling telecommunications services 
in 30 major markets or face $2.2 billion in fines. 

</P>
<P>
 *Ameritech    	
</P>
<P>
	Chicago-based Ameritech's operating profit rose nearly 21  
percent in the second quarter as revenues improved by 12 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The company earned $840 million, or 76 cents a share, excluding  
a one-time loss of $21 million related to the currency fluctuations 
in the purchase of a 20 percent stake in Bell Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	In last year's second quarter, Ameritech posted an operating  
profit of $695 million, or 63 cents a share. That excludes a 
one-time gain of $1.01 billion from the sale of Ameritech's stake 
in Telecom Corp. of New Zealand Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Including all one-time factors, Ameritech posted a net profit of  
$819 million, or 74 cents a share, in this year's second quarter, 
which compares with a net profit of $1.71 billion, or $1.54 a 
share, in the same period in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Second-quarter revenues totaled $4.80 billion, improving from  
$4.29 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Ameritech's shares rose nearly 3 percent following the report,  
which topped expectations the company would earn 72 cents per 
share, according to an analyst survey by First Call. In trading on 
the New York Stock Exchange, Ameritech was up $1.18 3/4 per share at 
$75. 
</P>
<P>
	The results exceeded Wall Street expectations by 4 cents,  
according to a survey of analysts by First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from data services advanced 71 percent, representing  
more than half of the quarter's total revenue growth, said Richard 
Notebaert, Ameritech's chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our international partnerships continue to deliver strong  
double-digit earnings growth,'' Notebaert said, referring to 
Ameritech's operations in 16 other countries.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Ship Sinks Chinese Boat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- A Philippine naval ship collided with  
and sank a Chinese fishing boat in a confrontation in disputed 
waters in the South China Sea, Philippine officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Government officials said they were investigating Monday's  
confrontation, in which a Philippine patrol ship chased two Chinese 
boats that were fishing in an area of the Spratly Islands claimed 
by both nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We express our regret at the incident,'' Foreign Affairs  
Secretary Domingo Siazon said. ``We are treating this incident very 
seriously.'' He insisted the sinking was not intentional. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, a Philippine ship chased three Chinese fishing boats in  
another disputed area. The ship hit one of the boats, which sank. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that this is another serious incident,'' Chinese  
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue said of the latest 
sinking. ``The Chinese fishermen were doing their normal fishing 
work in their traditional fishing ground and we express our shock 
and strong dissatisfaction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Siazon said he was told all the crew members aboard the Chinese  
boat were believed to have been rescued by the other Chinese boat. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philippines plans to bring up the issue of the Spratly  
Islands at this week's meeting of South East Asian foreign 
ministers in Singapore. Six countries claim the islands, which are 
believed to be rich in minerals and straddle vital sea routes in 
the South China Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Siazon said the incident showed the need for a code of conduct  
proposed by the Philippines to avoid future accidents. ``There is 
really an urgent need to deal with this issue as quickly as 
possible,'' Siazon said. ``Otherwise, these things will happen more 
frequently in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The People's Daily said 11 people were aboard the sunken boat  
and 14 on the other boat, which was seized by the Philippine ship. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese Embassy spokesman Chen Dehai said the Philippine vessel  
fired at the Chinese boats during the confrontation, which took 
place between the islands of Likas and Panata. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Chinese Embassy official, Ma Jie, said the Philippine  
ship chased the Chinese boats for three hours before ramming into 
them, sinking one. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado defended the navy ship's  
handling of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a matter of responsibility, (the navy) should challenge  
those who are fishing in the area,'' Mercado said. But he added 
that the incident should be reviewed carefully because ``these 
accidents may be misinterpreted.''

<HEADLINE> Canadians Talk With US Automakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Canadian Auto Workers opened contract talks  
with Detroit automakers Tuesday by calling on General Motors Corp. 
to improve pension plans and increase Canadian production. 
</P>
<P>
	CAW president Buzz Hargrove said he is optimistic about  
negotiations, but the automaker's poor labor relations and desire 
to outsource more work could be sticking points in negotiating a 
new three-year contract. The current agreement ends Sept. 21. 
</P>
<P>
	GM has met a lot of benchmarks, but ``the thing they've missed  
is labor management relations, which I think is the most crucial 
and is the place were they can save (money),'' Hargrove said after 
meeting with GM officials in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Union leaders will meet Wednesday with Ford Motor Co.  
representatives, followed Thursday by discussions with 
DaimlerChrysler AG. 
</P>
<P>
	The CAW struck GM's Oshawa, Ontario, assembly plant during 1996  
contract talks, idling some U.S. parts and assembly plants. 
Hargrove said the strike never would have happened had GM not tried 
to change its bargaining process. 
</P>
<P>
	Some recent tensions stem from issues during the company's  
reorganization, which dropped thousands of employees from the 
payroll worldwide, said Al Green, vice president and general 
director of personnel for GM of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove said a major concern is GM's moves to close plants,  
transfer work to outside parts suppliers and divest its Delphi 
Automotive Systems Corp. parts unit. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can define the company as General Motors, you can define  
the company as GM and Delphi,'' Hargrove said via a telephone news 
conference. ``You can define the company in any way you see fit in 
the future, but you can't change the commitment to the workers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said workers for those other companies should retain their  
rights under the union's agreements with GM. The Canadian auto 
union also wants Ford, GM and DaimlerChrysler to get commitments 
from their suppliers stating the companies will not interfere with 
union organizing drives at nonunion plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Green said that is largely out of the companies' hands.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's our place to tell our suppliers how to run  
their business,'' Green said. 
</P>
<P>
	The union also is determined to get GM to invest in its St.  
Therese, Quebec, assembly plant. Lowered demand for the Cameros and 
Firebirds produced there has raised speculation that it might be 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant, which now operates only on one shift, could be  
modified to produce a different product line, increase 
profitability and hire more workers, Hargrove said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wages are low on the CAW's priority list, but the union plans to  
press for better pensions and more time off. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides agreed they are optimistic about this year's talks,  
the first for Green since he became a vice president in Canada in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm optimistic we can do this without a strike. We have a good  
relationship with Ford Motor Co., we have a good relationship with 
Chrysler, and GM is starting to catch up,'' Hargrove said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Green ... we believe is a person committed to trying to  
improve the relationship and trying to get rid of some of issues 
that have put a strain on our relations, but we also caution GM not 
to underestimate our determination.''

<HEADLINE> Rams Confident of Signing Faulk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The St. Louis Rams traded for running back  
Marshall Faulk knowing they would have to re-do his contract, and 
they remain confident of reaching a deal by the start of training 
camp on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dick Vermeil said Faulk's agent, Rocky Arceneaux, and Rams  
contract negotiator Jay Zygmunt met Monday, but had no details. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how much progress was made,'' Vermeill said.  
``But I know if it can be done, it will be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams acquired Faulk, who was the best all-purpose back in  
the NFL last year with 1,319 yards rushing and 86 receptions, from 
Indianapolis two days before the draft. He has two years to go on a 
contract that pays him $2.2 million a year, and the sides have 
discussed a deal that would pay him about $5 million a year for 
either five or seven years with an $8 million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	It's believed the signing bonus is the holdup.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've been in the ballpark from a financial standpoint all  
along because Jay did such a tremendous amount of research in 
determining what the best running backs in the NFL make,'' Vermeil 
said. ``The negotiations did not start out in right field, they 
started on third base trying to get home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arceneaux was unavailable for comment. His phone number has been  
disconnected. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Rams report to camp for a team meeting at 5 p.m.  
Thursday at Western Illinois University in Macomb, Ill., they'll be 
shorthanded at running back even if Faulk signs. Amp Lee, a 
third-down specialist, will miss the entire camp after undergoing 
arthroscopic knee surgery less than two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee complained much of last season about tendinitis in the knee  
and it didn't improve with rest. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams have signed all but one of their draft picks, with  
quarterback Joe Germaine of Ohio State, a fourth-rounder, agreeing 
to terms Monday. The exception is seventh-rounder Rodney Williams, 
a punter from Georgia Tech, who was the next-to-last player chosen 
in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Vermeil said he didn't know what the holdup was, and was ready  
to wash his hands of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told Jay not to worry about it,'' Vermeil said. ``Those guys  
don't have a lot of power and they're not high on the totem pole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rams also released offensive lineman Ethan Brooks, a backup  
who played in 14 games mostly on special teams last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``His minicamps were not very good,'' Vermeil said. ``Let's just  
say it was a football decision.''

<HEADLINE> Tricon's Second Quarter Earnings Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Tricon Global Restaurants Inc. on Tuesday  
reported a 41 percent increase in second-quarter operating 
earnings, continuing steady growth as the company puts more of its 
Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and KFC restaurants to the hands of 
franchisees. 
</P>
<P>
	The Louisville-based company's earnings from continuing  
operations for the quarter ended June 12 were $97 million, or 60 
cents a share, compared to $69 million, or 45 cents a share, the 
same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's positive numbers came despite an ineffective  
tie-in with the Star Wars movie. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although the movie was a big success, my guess is the  
characters didn't resonate with customers the way they did the 
first time around,'' Chairman and CEO Andrall Pearson said. ``And 
there were so many people selling the figures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Doug Christopher of Crowell Weedon in Los Angeles said  
if the Star Wars promotion had been a success, Tricon could have 
had a blow-out quarter. Instead, he said, it relied on 
old-fashioned good business practices to meet Wall Street 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The company continued a pattern of slow, steady growth,'' he  
said. ``It's very good at reducing expenses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Part of Tricon's strategy includes increasing the number of its  
stores run by franchisees. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the quarter, franchisees and licensees owned 70  
percent of the system, up from 65 percent in the second quarter 
last year. Tricon sold more than 400 stores in the quarter and has 
sold more than 600 year-to-date. 
</P>
<P>
	Franchise fees grew by 16 percent, but refranchising efforts and  
closures of poor-performing stores drove revenues down 6 percent to 
$1.89 billion, compared with $2.01 billion in the same period last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Tricon said it expects franchisees and licensees to open more  
than 1,500 new units worldwide this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Pearson said the company's goal is for 80 percent of its stores  
to be in the hands of franchisees, and it thinks that can happen in 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Company same-store sales grew 9 percent at Pizza Hut driven by  
the continued success of the Big New Yorker pizza launched in the 
first quarter, the company said. KFC posted a 2 percent increase in 
company same-store sales, and Taco Bell grew 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	A continued turnaround in Tricon's Asia business helped  
international profits grow almost 60 percent. The international 
unit expects to open more than 650 stores in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income for the quarter rose 60 percent, to $179 million, or  
$1.10 per share, from $112 million, or 72 cents per share, largely 
due to a gain of 49 cents per share related to better-than expected 
proceeds from sales of stores. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of 1999, Tricon's net income is up 71  
percent, to $285 million, or $1.76 per share, compared with $166 
million or $1.07 cents per share for the same period a year ago. 
Sales were down 7 percent, to $3.39 billion compared with $3.66 
billion for the first half of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Tricon closed up $1.18 3/4, or 2 percent, at $52.93 3/4 on  
the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Pepsi Reports Profits Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- PepsiCo Inc. on Tuesday reported a 7 percent  
increase in second-quarter earnings from continuing operations, 
beating Wall Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	For the quarter ended June 12, Pepsi had operating profits of  
$467 million, or 31 cents a share, compared to $435 million, or 28 
cents a share in the year-ago quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call projected the company would earn  
29 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income for the quarter was up 50 percent, largely due to a  
one-time after-tax gain of $280 million from selling its 60 percent 
stake in Pepsi Bottling Group Inc., which went public in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income for the quarter was $743 million, or 49 cents a  
share, up 50 percent from $494 million, or 33 cents per share, in 
the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue shrank 5 percent, to $4.98 billion from $5.26 billion in  
the year-ago quarter, reflecting the loss of bottling revenue 
during the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales at the company's Tropicana juice division, which Pepsi  
acquired in August 1998, were up 12 percent to $533 million in the 
quarter, led by a 7 percent increase in Tropicana Pure Premium 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The Frito-Lay and Pepsi-Cola operations in North America also  
recorded increased sales, with Frito-Lay revenue rising 4 percent 
to $1.9 billion and Pepsi-Cola revenue rising 5 percent to $751 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first half of the year, sales were up 5 percent, to  
$10.1 billion from $9.6 billion for the same period in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six month of the year, Pepsi's operating profits  
were up 6 percent, to $849 million, or 56 cents a share, from $800 
million, or 52 cents a share, for the first half of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Pepsi shares rose 31 1/4 cents, to close at $38.87 1/2, on the New  
York Stock Exchange. The company released its earnings after the 
close of the market.

<HEADLINE> Helen Hunt, Hank Azaria Get Married </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES, Calif. (AP) -- Helen Hunt married longtime beau and  
fellow actor Hank Azaria, but the two won't slow down for a 
honeymoon any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are confirming that they were married over the weekend in a  
small private ceremony at their home in the greater Los Angeles 
area,'' publicist Stephen Huvane said Tuesday. ``Unfortunately, we 
can't release any more details. They're very private people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hunt, 36, who won an Oscar for ``As Good As It Gets,'' and  
Azaria, 35, who made frequent appearances on her show ``Mad About 
You'' as Nat the dog walker, dated for about five years, Huvane 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The honeymoon has been put on hold so they can finish work on  
movie projects.

<HEADLINE>  Hank Aaron Returns to Milwaukee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Hank Aaron returned Tuesday for an emotional  
visit to County Stadium, the scene of what he called the greatest 
of his record 755 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron was honored before the Milwaukee Brewers game with the  
Chicago White Sox. He said the home run he hit Sept. 30, 1957, to 
give the Milwaukee Braves their first National League pennant ranks 
ahead of his 715th on April 8, 1974, the one that broke Babe Ruth's 
career record. 
</P>
<P>
	``The greatest thrill I ever had, bar none, was the year we  
clinched the pennant here in 1957 when I hit the home run off Billy 
Muffett. That, to me, was probably the greatest thing that ever 
happened to me as a ballplayer,'' Aaron said. 
</P>
<P>
	His 11th inning homer gave the Braves a 7-5 victory, and they  
went on to beat the New York Yankees in the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron, who finished his career with the Brewers in 1976,  
returned on the 23rd anniversary of his final home run, a drive off 
the Angels' Dick Drago. 
</P>
<P>
	To honor Aaron's last home run, the seat where the ball landed --  
Section 28, Row 3, Seat 13 -- will become part of an exhibit after 
the Brewers move to Miller Park, probably after this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly a sad moment to know this stadium won't be here  
too much longer,'' Aaron said. ``It's touching. After all, you 
know, this ballpark and I have a love affair. And of course I've 
always had a love affair with Milwaukee and the people of 
Wisconsin. I want to thank all the people of Wisconsin because this 
is where it all got started.''

<HEADLINE> Tour de France Glance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PIAU-ENGALY, France (AP) -- A look at Tuesday's 15th stage of the  
Tour de France: 
</P>
<P>
	STAGE: A 108-mile stage between Saint-Gaudens and Piau-Engaly,  
high in the Pyrenees. 
</P>
<P>
	WINNER: Spain's Fernando Escartin, who had finished third on two  
stages this year, won in a time of five hours, 19 minutes, 49 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	HOW OTHERS FARED: Switzerland's Alex Zulle was second, and  
France's four-time King of the Mountains, Richard Virenque, was 
third. American Lance Armstrong came in fourth. 
</P>
<P>
	Virenque retained the dotted climbing jersey, and Erik Zabel of  
Germany kept the green sprinting jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	OVERALL STANDINGS: Escartin chopped more than a minute off  
Armstrong's lead of 7 minutes, 44 seconds. The Texan leads the 
Spaniard by 6 minutes, 19 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	TOUR TIDBITS: The Tour dipped into Spain for about 7 1/2 miles and  
Escartin got raucous support. He had never won a major stage 
before, and had marked a cross on a map at the point the race was 
to pass into Spain, just near his parents' home. 
</P>
<P>
	QUOTE OF THE DAY: ``I said: `It's now or never,''' Escartin  
recalled, referring to the day he marked the map. ``This is a very 
happy moment for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NEXT STAGE: Racing resumes Wednesday in the Pyrenees, a 120-mile  
stage from Lannemezan to Pau.

<HEADLINE> House Votes To Gut Teacher Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican-led House succeeded Tuesday in  
turning President Clinton's mandate last year to hire 100,000 new 
teachers into a block-grant program that will let states hire and 
train new teachers as they see fit. 
</P>
<P>
	The 100,000 new teachers survived during the year-end 1998  
budget negotiations but 24 Democrats joined Republicans Tuesday to 
convert the program into block grants. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, passed on a 239-185 vote, authorizes $2 billion in  
annual federal education programs over the next five years, 
including the administration's ``Goals 2000'' program to raise 
academic achievement and the new teacher program. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure drew a veto threat from the president, who said in a  
letter that it ``undermines a bipartisan commitment to reduce class 
size in the early grades.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would distribute 92 percent of the authorized spending  
directly to local school districts, which can spend it on hiring 
new teachers, training, expanding special education or other areas 
they regard as priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton recently released funds for the first 30,000 new  
teachers in his goal to add 100,000 with the aim of reducing the 
average class size from 22 pupils to 18. House Education and 
Workforce Committee Chairman Bill Goodling, R-Pa., complained there 
was ``no quality control whatsoever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't even know if they have to be able to add and  
substract,'' he added, arguing that a class of 25 with a quality 
teacher was better than a class of 17 with a poor teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Matthew Martinez, D-Calif., offered a Democratic substitute  
that would have increased spending to $3 billion, with $1.5 billion 
specifically set aside for class reduction activities. It also 
would have saved funding for a national board that issues 
credentials to teachers, which has been opposed by Republicans. It 
was defeated 217-207. 
</P>
<P>
	A companion plan in the Senate has not been acted upon. But the  
Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee said GOP 
leaders also are looking at giving states more flexibility in 
teacher hiring and training. 
</P>
<P>
	The House measure also specifically prohibits a national system  
of certifying teachers, a popular Democratic proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would be the second major education proposal taken  
up by Congress this session. After a compromise, Clinton signed an 
``ed-flex'' law allowing states more freedom in spending other 
federal education money.

<HEADLINE> Sheik Big Spender at Keeneland Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- The thoroughbred industry's biggest  
spenders swallowed hard and reached for their wallets Tuesday, as 
Keeneland's Select Yearling Sale wrapped up a record year, topped 
by the $3 million sale of a Storm Cat colt. 
</P>
<P>
	John Magnier and Michael Tabor's European-based Coolmore stable  
paid the sale-high price for the strapping chestnut colt out of 
Weekend Surprise, the dam to Belmont Stakes winner A.P. Indy and 
Preakness Stakes winner Summer Squall. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not very often that you get a chance to buy a  
half-brother to two classic winners,'' said Demi O'Byrne, 
bloodstock agent for Coolmore. ``He's the one that was at the top 
of our list. He's a beautful-looking individual, and has a world of 
potential, we think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's evening session saw yearling after yearling -- 10 in  
all -- go for $1 million or more. The 20 yearlings sold for $1 
million or more during the two-day sale were the most for a July 
sale since 1985. And the average price of $581,932 paid for 132 
yearlings was an all-time record. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, 149 yearlings sold for an average of $482,765, with  
15 going for $1 million or more. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's frenetic final session also saw a Gone West filly out  
of Miraloma go for $2.8 million to a partnership of Coolmore and 
Satish Sanan's Padua Stables. 
</P>
<P>
	The price was the second-highest ever paid for a filly at the  
July sale, trailing only the $3.75 million paid for Seattle Slew 
daughter Alchaasibiyeh in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	For Sanan, who made a big-spending splash in last year's  
Keeneland sale, the Gone West filly was his only 
million-dollar-plus purchase this year. Sanan said he went along 
with trainer D. Wayne Lukas' enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wayne loves the pedigree, and she is one of those fillies who  
could make your broodmare band,'' Sanan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The yearling was consigned by Bob and Beverly Lewis, for whom  
Lukas trained Miraloma. Bob Lewis said the $2.8 million made up for 
the disappointment he experienced Monday, when a daughter of Mr. 
Prospector and champion filly Serena's Song that he and his wife 
had consigned sold for just $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank goodness for Satish,'' Lewis said.  
</P>
<P>
	Moments later, agent Dan Kenny, who had been beaten in the  
bidding for the Gone West-Miraloma filly, spent $2 million of 
Eugene Melnyk's money on a Gone West colt out of Silken Cat. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the big spenders -- including Melnyk, Padua, Saudi Arabian  
Prince Ahmed Salman's Thoroughbred Corp. and Sheikh Mohammed al 
Maktoum, crown prince of Dubai, United Arab Emirates -- Coolmore was 
most active at the top of the market. Magnier and Tabor bought five 
million-dollar yearlings on their own, plus the one in partnership 
with Sanan. 
</P>
<P>
	Though competition was fierce at the pinnacle of the market,  
buyers were more selective about colts and fillies at the lower end 
of the scale. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 216 yearlings cataloged, 35 were taken out by  
veterinarians or their owners before reaching the ring, and 49 
failed to generate bids higher than the minimums set by their 
owners. The result was a record low number of yearlings sold at a 
Keeneland July sale. 
</P>
<P>
	With buyers seeking quality pedigrees, one thing that could be  
counted on were high prices for foals from standout sires like Gone 
West, Storm Cat and Mr. Prospector. 
</P>
<P>
	The latter, who was euthanized last month at age 29, fetched big  
money from bidders coveting foals from his penultimate crop. Kenny 
was one of those buyers, spending $1 million of Melnyk's money for 
a filly out of Fit For A Queen. And Coolmore's O'Byrne paid $1 
million for a Mr. Prospector-Angel Fever colt who is a full brother 
to last year's sale topper, which went for $4 million to Japanese 
horseman Fusao Sekiguchi. 
</P>
<P>
	Four Gone West foals sold for $1 million or more, as did four  
Storm Cat foals and two foals by Woodman. 
</P>
<P>
	Onetime Texas billionaire Nelson Bunker Hunt, whose thoroughbred  
racing operation collapsed along with his fortune in the 1980s, 
returned to the Keeneland sale for the first time in more than a 
decade, spending $335,000 on three yearlings.

<HEADLINE> TV Execs Grilled on Fall Series </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- None of the 27 new comedies and dramas  
debuting on the top four broadcast networks this fall has a 
minority character in a leading role. Few include minorities in 
supporting roles. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue dominated the annual Television Critics Association  
summer gathering this week. The NAACP and other groups have 
condemned broadcasters for putting up a virtually all-white slate 
of series this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, all the complaints are real,'' said producer Bruce  
Helford (``The Drew Carey Show''). He was on hand at WB's session 
Tuesday to promote a sitcom he is developing. 
</P>
<P>
	Although network executives would have preferred to keep the  
spotlight on their product, it was clear that questions about race 
-- and, to a lesser extent, violence -- would be unavoidable. 
</P>
<P>
	WB chief executive Jamie Kellner was asked if fledgling  
networks, which have targeted black audiences to gain a market 
foothold, will abandon those viewers when they become more 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
	WB in its early days relied heavily on black-oriented sitcoms,  
but its new fall series are stocked with young white characters -- 
as is the case with the big four networks, ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	Kellner, however, said the network is not abandoning ethnic  
series. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it's good business for us. We intend to stay in the  
business,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,  
at its annual convention last week, announced an initiative to 
monitor how well the entertainment industry reflects America's 
multiculturalism, and said lawsuits and advertiser boycotts could 
be summoned as weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Writer-producer Yvette Lee Bowser, who is developing a  
comedy-drama about a young black woman for the WB, said the 
exclusion of minority characters is an ongoing problem. 
</P>
<P>
	At the UPN session Monday, the network's president and chief  
executive, Dean Valentine, was asked if advertisers discount the 
value of black shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, we haven't found that to be the case,'' Valentine said,  
noting that UPN has stuck with black-oriented comedies in the fall 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's a lot of people who want to reach that  
audience, and I think it's a mistake to cut them out of the 
broadcast spectrum.''

<HEADLINE> Roche Selling Some Genentech Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BASEL, Switzerland (AP) -- Shares of Genentech soared 31 percent  
in their first day of trading since Swiss pharmaceutical giant 
Roche purchased the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Roche priced the initial public offering of 20 million shares in  
U.S. biotechnology firm Genentech Inc. at $97 per share. netting it 
$1.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The offering will leave Roche with about 84.3 percent of  
Genentech stock, the Swiss company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Genentech shares started trading Tuesday on the New York Stock  
Exchange, opening at $118 and closing at $127. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Roche said it would allow Genentech to remain an  
independent company, agreeing to buy outstanding shares of the U.S. 
firm and then make a public offering. It bought the outstanding 
shares on June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Roche had the option to essentially absorb the South San  
Francisco, Calif.-based pharmaceutical maker. Instead, it will 
retain control over the company as majority shareholder, but 
Genentech will remain a publicly traded, independent company.

<HEADLINE> O's Miller Ejected For Arguing Call </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Orioles manager Ray Miller was ejected from  
Tuesday night's game against the New York Mets after arguing a call 
at third base. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller was tossed by third-base umpire Rick Reed, who called  
Baltimore runner Rich Amaral out on the front end of a double 
steal. Although replays showed Amaral arrived at the bag before the 
tag, his path to the base was blocked by third baseman Robin 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
	Within seconds of the call, Miller ran from the Baltimore dugout  
and engaged in an heated argument with Reed. Their faces were 
within inches of each other before Reed pulled away and ejected 
Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	It was his second ejection of the season. He was also tossed  
July 2 at Yankee Stadium.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Bears Waive Erik Kramer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- The Chicago Bears today waived veteran  
quarterback Erik Kramer, who became the Bears' all-time leading 
passer in his five years with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer, 34, had last season cut short by knee and shoulder  
surgeries. He isn't fully recovered from rotator cuff surgery, 
which has limited his throwing in the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a football decision,'' said Bears spokesman Bryan Harlan.  
He declined to elaborate further. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the injuries that limited his playing to only eight  
games last season, Kramer led the team in passing for the third 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer was originally signed as a free agent in 1994 from  
Detroit. He threw for 10,582 yards of 1,557 attempts with 63 
touchdowns and 45 interceptions in his five seasons in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears now have four quarterbacks, including Jim Miller,  
Moses Moreno, Shane Matthews and unsigned first-round draft pick 
Cade McNown.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Cautions China on Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today the United States  
``would take very seriously'' any attempt by China to use force 
against Taiwan over Taiwan's hints at independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to reporters in the White House Rose Garden, the  
president recounted his Sunday conversation with Chinese President 
Jiang Zemin, in which he said the United States supports the 
``one-China'' policy and has been encouraging Taiwan to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``one-China'' policy has marked relations between Taiwan and  
China since they separated in 1949 amid civil war. 
</P>
<P>
	``China knows very well what our policy is, and we know quite  
well what their policy is,'' Clinton told reporters. ``I believe 
the action of the United States in affirming our support of the 
one-China policy ... will be helpful in easing some of the 
tensions, and that was the context in which our conversation 
occurred.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke with Jiang by phone for a half-hour Sunday, while  
still at the presidential retreat at Camp David, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made it clear our policy had not changed, including our view  
under the Taiwan Relations Act that we would take very seriously 
any abridgment of the peaceful dialogue'' between China and Taiwan, 
Clinton said. ``I thought it was a very positive conversation, far 
more positive than negative. That is the light in which I meant it 
to unfold, and I think that is the shape it is taking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui defended his  
comments that China must deal with Taiwan on a state-to-state 
basis, and declared, ``Only after we have democratic reunification 
shall there be the possibility of one China.''

<HEADLINE> Drug Firms Report Profit Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SmithKline Beecham reported Tuesday its second-quarter profits  
rose 16 percent, driven by strong sales of several new drugs, and 
Johnson &AMP; Johnson also reported a double-digit gain on strong sales 
of anemia and antipsychotic drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	But American Home Products' profits plunged by 24 percent  
because of lower sales of animal medicines and agricultural 
products and a one-time charge for the suspension of sales of its 
RotaShield virus. 
</P>
<P>
	A look at the companies' results:  

</P>
<P>
 *SmithKline Beecham PLC    	
</P>
<P>
	SmithKline earned $487 million, or 40 cents per share in the  
second quarter, compared to $433 million, or 36 cents per share, in 
the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Results for the company, based in London and with U.S.  
headquarters in Philadelphia, matched Wall Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 11 percent to $3.5 billion from $3.2 billion,  
including the effects of foreign currency exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief executive Jan Leschly attributed company growth to solid  
sales of its antibiotics and vaccines. Worldwide sales of the 
anti-depressant Paxil rose 27 percent to $527 million and 
Augmentin, an antibiotic, rose 19 percent to $383 million 
</P>
<P>
	SmithKline also makes Nicorette gum and NicoDerm CQ, a patch  
designed to help smokers quit, and LYMErix, the world's first Lyme 
vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
	For the six months ended June 30, profits rose 14 percent to  
$1.09 billion, or 89 cents per share, up from $959 million, or 78 
cents per share in the first half of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 11 percent to $6.88 billion from $6.31 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	SmithKline shares fell $1.62 1/2 to $61.37 1/2 in trading on the New  
York Stock Exchange. 

</P>
<P>
                         *Johnson &AMP; Johnson    	
</P>
<P>
	Johnson &AMP; Johnson's second-quarter profits rose a  
better-than-expected 14.9 percent, as the health care conglomerate 
gained from a strong sales of its anemia and antipsychotic drugs 
and orthopedic products. 
</P>
<P>
	J&AMP;J had second-quarter profits of $1.16 billion, or 84 cents per  
share, up from $1.01 billion or 74 cents per share a year ago. 
Results beat analysts' expectations by 2 cents, according to First 
Call. 
</P>
<P>
	Second-quarter sales jumped 18.5 percent to $6.9 billion from  
$5.78 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	New Brunswick, N.J.-based J&AMP;J saw sales growth across its line  
of diverse health businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Pharmaceutical sales rose 25.4 percent to $2.7 billion, driven  
largely by wholesalers stocking up on drugs in anticipation of a 
price increase later this year. Sales of Procrit/Eprex, drugs used 
to treat anemia in cancer patients, rose by 54 percent. Sales of 
Risperdol, an antipsychotic medication, rose by 37 percent. Procrit 
and Risperdol are J&AMP;J's two top selling drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	J&AMP;J's professional line of business had a 19.8 percent increase  
in sales, driven by demand for surgical products such as coronary 
stents that help prop open closed arteries. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales in J&AMP;J's consumer division rose 7.4 percent to $1.7  
billion, driven by sales of Neutrogena skin care products and 
Tylenol pain reliever. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of 1998, J&AMP;J's profit rose 16.9 percent  
to $2.28 billion, or $1.66 per share, from $2.02 billion, or $1.47 
per share, in the first half of 1998 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 16.7 percent to $13.49 billion from $11.57 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	J&AMP;J shares rose 50 cents to $96.43 3/4 in trading on the New York  
Stock Exchange. 

</P>
<P>
                    *American Home Products Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	American Home, maker of Robitussin cough syrup and Advil pain  
reliever, had a profit of $398.7 million, or 30 cents per share, 
compared to $523.5 million, or 39 cents per share, in the same 
period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results matched Wall Street expectations.  
</P>
<P>
	American Home said it took a $53 million charge against  
earnings, or 4 cents per share, for the costs associated with 
suspending sales of its rotavirus vaccine, RotaShield. The Madison, 
N.J.-based company agreed with federal regulators to suspend use of 
the vaccine, given to prevent intestinal infection, because of 
safety concerns. About 1 million infants have received the vaccine 
since it was approved a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldwide sales fell 1 percent after adjusting for the sale of  
American Home's medical devices business, sold in February 1998. 
Sales slipped to $3.32 billlion from $3.34 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug sales increased 8 percent in the second quarter to $2.24  
billion. But agricultural product sales fell 29 percent to $576.1 
million because of reduced demand for herbicides. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home's consumer sales, which include Centrum vitamins  
and Chapstick lip balm, rose 10 percent to $503.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of 1998, overall profits fell 1 percent  
to $1.05 billion, or 79 cents a share, from $1.51 billion, or $1.13 
per share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	First-half sales fell to $6.76 billion from $7.01 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	American Home said sales were hurt by an unfavorable foreign  
exchange of 2 percent for the 1999 second quarter and 1 percent for 
the first half of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of AHP fell $1.93 3/4 to $50.93 3/4 in trading on the New York  
Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Lockheed-Martin Loses $41 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- Lockheed Martin lost $41 million in the  
second quarter due to higher-than-expected costs in making cargo 
planes and satellite launch failures 
</P>
<P>
	The defense contractor reported Tuesday a loss of 11 cents per  
share in the three months ending June 30, compared to a profit of 
$289 million, or 76 cents per share for the comparable period in 
1998. Net sales were $6.2 billion, down 5 percent from $6.5 billion 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had predicted Lockheed  
would lose 13 cents a share. However, Lockheed warned analysts last 
month that it may lose between 10 and 15 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed has said it suffered four failed satellite launches in  
eight months and higher-than-expected costs in making the C-130J 
transport plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed is also considering divesting up to $1 billion worth of  
its businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	For the six-month period ended June 30, Lockheed lost $128  
million, or 34 cents a share, on revenue of $12.4 billion. In the 
year-ago period, Lockheed earned $558 million, or $1.47 cents a 
share, on revenue of $12.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The company received better news last week when Israel ordered  
50 F-16 fighter jets in a deal worth $2.5 billion. To land the 
deal, Lockheed pledged $1 billion in contracts with Israeli defense 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Lockheed fell 75 cents to $38 in trading on the New  
York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> McGwire, La Russa Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Mark McGwire was back in the St. Louis  
Cardinals' lineup Tuesday night after taking almost three days off 
for back spasms. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who was batting .268 with 31 homers and 79 RBIs, said  
he felt fine. He left Saturday night's game after striking out to 
end the first inning against James Baldwin of the Chicago White 
Sox, and then sat out Sunday and Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	He's missed five starts this season.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've been having back problems since 1989 and it's  
well-documented,'' McGwire said. ``I know my back like the back of 
my hand. Thank god it wasn't any disc, it was just muscle spasms 
and I just needed two days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire said back spasms were just part of the equation for a  
slugger. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your back's not meant to swing a baseball bat 100,000 times a  
year,'' he said. ``It's that simple. I don't know many guys that 
play baseball that don't have bad backs. It's a common thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire said he was trying to go a full year without having any  
disc problems 
</P>
<P>
	``So far, so good this year,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Cardinals manager Tony La Russa also was back in charge. La  
Russa spent much of Monday at the doctor's office with a stomach 
ailment, and watched the 8-4 victory over Minnesota from the 
clubhouse while under mild sedation.

<HEADLINE> Gold Funds: Bargain-Hunters' Dream? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In movies like ``Treasure of the Sierra Madre''  
and ``Goldfinger'' people would lie, cheat, steal, even kill for 
gold. These days it looks like no one wants to go near it, 
including mutual fund investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Funds that focus on gold mining stocks have dropped along with  
the price of gold itself, which went for $875 an ounce in 1980 but 
trades today in the $250 range. Through mid-July, gold funds turned 
in the worst year-to-date performance of all the fund categories 
tracked by Lipper Inc., with a return of minus 11.46 percent. By 
comparison, funds linked to the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index had a 
positive return of 15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Look back over the past five years, and the carnage continues,  
with gold funds suffering an average return of minus 15.35 percent 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact is, investors who have been in gold funds long-term  
have lost money, and they're understandably not happy. But for 
bargain-hunters looking for an undervalued investment, gold funds 
might be worth considering. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't mean it has lost any of usefulness. It's just out  
of favor,'' James Turk, strategic adviser to the Midas Fund, said 
of gold. ``When it becomes this extreme on the negative side as it 
is now, it's a sign that a price reversal is lurking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Foster, co-manager of the Van Eyck gold funds, has a  
similar view. 
</P>
<P>
	``The downside risk is extremely limited -- we can go down from  
here, but not much farther to have to be at or near the bottom,'' 
said Foster, who expects gold funds to rebound ``when conditions 
are right -- whether it's three months or 12 months, I don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gold's problem is that relatively few people believe they need  
to continue holding it as a hedge against inflation or political 
uncertainty. Central banks including the Bank of England have begun 
selling off some of their reserves, believing their money would be 
better invested in other assets, including stocks, and that has 
helped send gold prices down even more. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster says supply and demand and fundamental economic issues  
will help lift gold prices. Demand currently is running ahead of 
supply, but selling by central banks rather than gold-producing 
companies is helping to fill that demand. Foster predicted that as 
central bank sales slow, mining companies will have more 
opportunity to improve their sales, and their stocks should rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, fund managers try to be upbeat, although plenty of  
other people believe gold is no longer a worthwhile investment and 
have backed up that belief by selling gold mining stocks and funds. 
</P>
<P>
	But in making their case for gold, fund managers can point to  
other investments that have made dramatic comebacks recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, when Asian economies began to collapse, there was  
a similar negative sentiment about funds that focused on Pacific 
Rim stocks, and investors bailed out. But many others hung on, and 
today, they're being congratulated for their tenacity as net asset 
values climb back above their mid-1997 levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Funds specializing in Japanese stocks have returned 52.27  
percent so far this year, according to Lipper's calculations, and 
funds specializing in Pacific region stocks have returned 44.8 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's the example of another commodity, crude oil, which  
had slumped to the neighborhood of $10 a barrel late last year and 
is now trading at nearly twice that amount. Natural resource funds, 
which include oil stocks, have returned 30.55 percent so far this 
year, and in the past 13 weeks, 14.96 percent, more than double the 
6.73 percent returned by S&AMP;P funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil's comeback could indirectly help the gold funds. ``The  
doubling of crude oil prices in the last six months will be 
reflected in inflation numbers sooner or later,'' Turk said. He 
also noted continuing economic uncertainty in Argentina and Brazil 
may make gold -- which is a universal currency -- more attractive to 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	It's important to keep in mind that gold should be just one part  
of a diversified investment plan. Both Turk and Foster suggest 
devoting between 5 percent and 10 percent of a portfolio to gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold funds have made themselves less vulnerable by adding  
non-gold stocks to their portfolios. Oppenheimer Gold &AMP; Special 
Minerals Fund has outperformed other gold funds by placing 20 
percent of its assets in platinum and palladium producers, 
according to the Value Line Mutual Fund Survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Turk said the Midas Fund has approximately 10 percent of its  
holdings in platinum-related stocks, and another 10 percent in 
silver-related stocks.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Organizers Open Archives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Members of the media wanting to get a glimpse of  
Atlanta's Olympic history have to wait a little longer. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because the city's Olympic organizers say it will take  
two days to access the actual documents, meaning the few requests 
turned in Monday won't be available until Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't know what to expect, so this is the most streamlined  
process we could come up with,'' said Lee Echols, a spokesman for 
the defunct Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
	On the three-year anniversary of the 1996 Olympic opening  
ceremony, the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games allowed 
viewing of an index of about 6,500 boxes of documents and took 
requests to see the boxes themselves -- a process expected to take 
two days for each request. 
</P>
<P>
	The delay was attributed to the location of the records. They  
are stored in several places around the city, including the Atlanta 
History Center and archiving firm Pierce Leahey. 
</P>
<P>
	The furor over the records, including eight controversial boxes  
recently turned over to the House Commerce Committee, began soon 
after a congressional investigation was opened after last year's 
bribery scandal involving the International Olympic Committee and 
officials from Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC members received cash and gifts such as free medical care  
and college scholarships for family members by bid officials from 
Salt Lake City, which won the 2002 Winter Games. In the fallout, 
nine IOC members have resigned or been expelled. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight boxes were not made available and were not listed in  
the index, and Commerce Committee spokesman Pete Sheffield would 
not disclose what was in the eight boxes. 
</P>
<P>
	ACOG officials, including former president Billy Payne, insist  
they broke no rules in winning the 1996 Games, although they 
recently admitted to violating the IOC $200 gift limit 38 times. 
</P>
<P>
	No one from the public put in a request to view the boxes  
Monday. Three media outlets came to ACOG offices, including The 
Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper and state Attorney General Thurbert Baker sued  
ACOG and the Georgia Amateur Athletic Foundation in April for 
access to the records, including the eight boxes in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	They argue the records are covered by the Georgia Open Records  
Act. ACOG has sued to keep them private, arguing they contain 
personal information. Judge Bensonetta Tifton Lane has not 
indicated when she will rule. 
</P>
<P>
	The index made available Monday consists of five binders, each  
up to 5 inches thick. It lists such documents as unsolicited 
recommendations and designs for the Atlanta Olympic mascot, a file 
on terrorist ``nuts,'' T-shirts, videos of everything from 
competitions to art exhibits, and several files of correspondence 
from Payne and former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers don't know what's in about 75 percent of the boxes,  
according to Richard Stogner, who is overseeing the archiving and 
the dissolution of ACOG. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of them were taped up in August 1996, shoved in a closet  
and haven't been touched since,'' Stogner said.

<HEADLINE> Story Counts in `After the Fair' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The score almost seems to be an unnecessary  
addition to ``After the Fair,'' a somber little musical that 
derives much of its dramatic punch from its original source, a 
Thomas Hardy short story. 
</P>
<P>
	The adaptation of Hardy's ``On the Western Circuit'' by Stephen  
Cole skillfully condenses and dramatizes the tale of a forlorn 
marriage between a stuffy, ineffectual wine merchant and his 
unhappy wife. 
</P>
<P>
	What the off-Broadway musical at the Theater at St. Peter's  
Church can't quite do is put their tribulations into song. Cole's 
lyrics and Matthew Ward's music threaten every now and then to 
deliver more than mournful meanderings, but glumness triumphs in 
the end. 
</P>
<P>
	The cast tries very hard, particularly Michele Pawk who does the  
lion's share of the suffering -- and singing -- on stage. Pawk is a 
terrific performer as anyone knows who caught her Broadway turns in 
``Crazy for You'' and the 1998 revival of ``Cabaret.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Here, Pawk is forced to play pinched and quivering to the hilt.  
The plot is an English country variation on ``Cyrano de Bergerac.'' 
In it, a repressed upper-class housewife writes love letters for 
her illiterate maid, who gets pregnant during a fling with a 
handsome young lawyer -- after the fair. Of course, the older woman 
falls in love. 
</P>
<P>
	The authors have pretty much put Pawk and company in a musical  
straitjacket here. Everyone pines for someone else: neglected 
husband for wife. Wife and maid for young man. Young man for the 
woman he thought wrote the letters but didn't. 
</P>
<P>
	As the doomed younger couple, James Ludwig and Jennifer Piech  
have fine voices and attractive stage personalities but they can't 
overcome the sameness of the musical material. Poor David Staller 
is forced to simper ineffectually as the wimp of a husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Directed with restraint by Travis Stockley, ``After the Fair''  
proves genteel to a fault. Unfortunately, it is unable to do the 
one thing most required of a musical -- sing.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Vs. Yen, Down Vs. Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose Tuesday against the yen after  
the Federal Reserve intervened on behalf of the Bank of Japan, 
selling about $500 million worth of the Japanese currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Against a reinvigorated euro, however, the dollar retreated  
sharply for a second straight day. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 118.95 yen,  
up from 117.80 late Monday. The euro was quoted at $1.0413, up from 
$1.0294 late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen's decline came amid reports that the U.S. central bank  
was buying dollars at the request of the Bank of Japan, which later 
confirmed it had asked the Fed to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
	Because a strong yen makes Japanese exports more expensive in  
other currencies, Tokyo is worried that the yen's strength will 
stifle recent signs of recovery from Japan's recession. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading Tuesday, the dollar was quoted at 1.5415 Swiss  
francs, down from 1.5568 a day earlier; and 1.4913 Canadian 
dollars, up from 1.4892 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The British pound fell to $1.5689 from late Monday's quote of  
$1.5805. 
</P>
<P>
	The currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are  
no longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Tuesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8783  
German marks, down from 1.9001; and 6.3012 French francs, down from 
6.3735.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Fall Further; Dow Off 140.26 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply today as investors who  
bought heavily on the promise of strong corporate earnings began 
trimming their portfolios to capture profits. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 140.26 at 11,047.42, adding to yestrtday's drop of 22.16. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was off 26.65 at 1,381.00, and the Nasdaq composite 
index, dominated by technology issues, was down 91.93 at 2,738.36. 
</P>
<P>
	As the second-quarter earnings reporting season continues,  
companies are turning in impressive profit figures. Today, a trio 
of Dow components -- Johnson &AMP; Johnson, General Motors and United 
Technologies -- reported earnings that beat Wall Street estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	But with major market indexes close to record levels, few big  
companies have managed any significant bounce from their strong 
earnings. Johnson &AMP; Johnson rose 1/4 to 96 3/16, GM slipped 15/16 to 
67 3/8 and United Technologies rose 3/4 to 69 9/16. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a sparkling rally,'' said Joseph V. Battipaglia,  
chief investment strategist at Gruntal &AMP; Co. in New York. ``While 
there's been no disappointments, there has been some room for 
short-term selling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street's high expectations for corporate profits have  
created a punishing climate for any companies that offer even a 
hint of weakness. Microsoft fell 3 to 95 3/8 today, after announcing 
late Monday it expects revenue growth to slow in fiscal year 2000, 
which began July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft beat earnings estimates by 4 cents per share in its  
fiscal fourth quarter. But the company's chief financial officer 
warned its stellar rate of growth will be difficult to sustain as 
personal computer sales slow, Year 2000 computer problems linger 
and Microsoft makes hefty investments in new arenas. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft fell 5 5/8 to 92 3/4 today. Analysts discounted the cautious  
revenue forecast, saying the selloff was due almost entirely to 
profit-taking. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM had a similar fate, plunging 7 3/16 to 127 7/16 and  
contributing most heavily to the Dow's losses. Big Blue said after 
the market closed Monday that its second-quarter profits jumped 65 
percent, beating analysts' expectations by 3 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts said that because shares of IBM have risen more  
than 40 percent so far this year, investors are reluctant to build 
up their positions in the stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 11-to-5 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 501.6 million 
shares, ahead of Monday's quiet pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 9.38 at 649.19, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 11.86 at 805.80. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 7.97 to 453.40.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Women Appear on Letterman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mia Hamm, Brandi Chastain and the rest of the  
women's World Cup team continued their victory tour Tuesday, 
appearing on the Late Show with David Letterman. 
</P>
<P>
	The team postponed an appearance on Jay Leno's competing show  
because it felt obligated to appear on Letterman's program first. 
Letterman has given the women plenty of attention since the World 
Cup tournament began, constantly referring to them as ``soccer 
mamas'' and ``babe city''. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm and Chastain were the only two players to be interviewed by  
the New York host. They were asked a variety of questions ranging 
from why there is extra time in soccer to the reasons for their 
absence on a Wheaties box. 
</P>
<P>
	The segment, which was filmed at 5:30 p.m. EDT, lasted about 15  
minutes. It began with a standing ovation from the crowd and 
concluded with the rest of the team bringing out the World Cup 
trophy and joining their teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	Letterman gave each player and coach Tony DiCicco a voucher for  
a free dinner for two at the ``21'' restaurant in midtown 
Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamm and Chastain, wearing yellow World Cup T-shirts and blue  
shorts, appeared at ease in front of Letterman, who has a 
reputation for making guests act uneasy. 
</P>
<P>
	The host didn't pull many surprises during the segment, although  
an exchange about goalkeeper Briana Scurry did entertain the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``The spirit of the rule is that the goalkeeper can move  
laterally,'' Chastain said about Scurry moving before a penalty 
kick. 
</P>
<P>
	``And sometimes, I think in this case, our goalkeeper maybe  
indicated she maybe had a little too much spirit with that rule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the team's second appearance in New York since its  
shootout victory over China in the title match. There was a midtown 
parade last week in its honor.

<HEADLINE> All-Star Outing May Have Hurt Pedro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- An excited Pedro Martinez put on a dazzling  
All-Star game performance before his home fans, throwing hard and 
striking out five of the six batters he faced. 
</P>
<P>
	It may have been too much.  
</P>
<P>
	One day after the Boston Red Sox announced a sore right shoulder  
is forcing Martinez to miss a start for the first time in his 
career, pitching coach Joe Kerrigan said the 28 pitches he threw 
against the NL might be the reason. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just normal aches and pains you go through,'' Kerrigan  
said Tuesday night, a week after Martinez won the MVP award at the 
All-Star game in Fenway Park. ``He might have overextended himself 
in the All-Star game. He was sore the next three days to the point 
where he couldn't play catch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He finally was able to throw the ball the next day, last  
Saturday. On Sunday, he made his 19th start of the season. It was 
the worst of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez allowed a career-high nine runs in 3 2-3 innings, his  
shortest outing of the season. The Red Sox did come back to win 
11-9 and Martinez said nothing about the soreness to reporters 
after the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he won't throw a ball until Thursday and, after 172 starts,  
won't take the mound as scheduled Friday night in Detroit. Jin Ho 
Cho will take his place. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerrigan said he didn't know if Martinez would miss another  
start. Martinez said his shoulder has been sore for about a month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every pitcher has something he has to work through,'' Red Sox  
manager Jimy Williams said Tuesday. ``He tried to pitch through it. 
He kept pitching and the results were good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez felt fine in his last start before the All--Star game, a  
3-2 loss to Tampa Bay on July 7, Kerrigan said. And he was able to 
play long toss on July 11, two days before the All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerrigan said it was the right decision for Martinez, whose 15-3  
record is the best in the majors, to pitch against the NL. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the dream of every player,'' Kerrigan said.  
</P>
<P>
	Bret Saberhagen, Boston's No. 2 starter, missed the entire 1996  
season and most of 1997 after undergoing shoulder surgery. 
Martinez's condition isn't nearly as serious. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's better to take the time now and get it right,''  
Saberhagen said, ``because if you come back too soon, which I 
found, and you're not ready, it's going to cost you even more 
time.''

<HEADLINE> Bristol Technology Announces Layoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DANBURY, Conn. (AP) -- Bristol Technology Inc. may be shrinking  
after losing a federal court battle against Microsoft Corp., but 
the tiny software company isn't ready to give up its fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week's unfavorable verdict in U.S. District Court has  
forced the small software maker to cut 17 jobs, or 20 percent of 
its 70-person staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The Danbury-based company, with just 70 employees and $8.7  
million in revenues last year, sued Microsoft in August, claiming 
that the industry leader was trying to crush competition by 
preventing access to its source code -- software blueprints -- for 
Windows NT. Bristol spent more than $1 million to prepare its case 
for trial. 
</P>
<P>
	But the jury on Friday found that Microsoft did not violate  
antitrust laws in its dealings with Bristol. It did find that 
Microsoft committed a deceptive act that violated the Connecticut 
Unfair Trade Practices Act, but awarded Bristol just $1 on that 
claim. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're working hard here to keep the company going,'' said  
Bristol CEO Keith Blackwell. ``The culture here is people work hard 
anyway. That will continue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blackwell said Bristol intends to pursue Microsoft in the U.S.  
Court of Appeals. He said the first legal step will likely be to 
request a retrial. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still believe in the case, as much as the day we started,''  
Blackwell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol makes a software product called Wind/U, which allows  
programs written specifically for Windows to be converted to run on 
computers with different operating systems such as UNIX. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1994 to 1997, the two companies had a contract under which  
Microsoft provided Bristol access to source code for an earlier 
version of Windows NT. Bristol filed its lawsuit after they were 
unable to reach an agreement on a contract for the newest versions. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-week trial in U.S. District Court pitted Bristol, a  
little-known company, against the Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft 
with 27,000 employees and $14.48 billion in fiscal 1998 revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Blackwell said Bristol will continue to service existing Wind/U  
customers. But Wind/U, which provides Bristol with 80 percent to 90 
percent of its revenue, will become outdated without the new 
Windows source code, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is working to develop new products for software  
developers to make up for the anticipated loss in revenue, 
Blackwell said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's forcing us to back up and start over,'' Blackwell said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Helped Forbes Defect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton helped persuade Rep. Michael  
Forbes of New York to defect from the Republican Party but ``it was 
not a hard sell,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, a moderate who was elected to Congress in the 1994  
Republican landslide, announced his switch to the Democratic side 
Saturday, saying the GOP had become captives of extremists. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes said today that the nation's GOP governors were not the  
target of his criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have gone to great pains, frankly, to separate themselves  
form the extremists that are running the Republican Party in the 
House,'' Forbes told Albany's WROW-AM radio in an interview from 
his Washington office. ``It's not a coincidence that (Texas Gov.) 
George W. Bush coined the phrase `compassionate conservative,' 
because he wants to make sure America knows that he is not like 
those extremists who run the House of Representatives,'' Forbes 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes visited the White House before Congress' July 4 recess  
and met with chief of staff John Podesta. The congressman said he 
wanted to talk with the president, and Podesta took him to the Oval 
Office for a conversation that ran nearly an hour. The president 
also spoke with Forbes by telephone once more before his decision 
and then again after. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes told Clinton his switch was a difficult decision but ``he  
was just more comfortable with where the Democratic Party was'' on 
issues such as the patient's bill of rights and tax and budget 
issues, Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not a hard sell,'' the spokesman said. ``I don't think  
the president tried a hard sell. But he certainly made it known 
that the Democratic Party welcomed him, welcomed independent 
thinking, the big tent we've talked about.''

	Divers Search for Plane Wreckage  
</P>
<P>
	AQUINNAH, Mass. (AP) -- Divers returned to the ocean off Martha's  
Vineyard today in the search for John F. Kennedy Jr.'s plane. The 
Navy divers had been given a list of 15 submerged sites to examine 
by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, up from 
nine sites. A spokesman for NOAA said two sonar-equipped ships are 
scanning the ocean floor for signs of the plane's wreckage. Also 
today, a newspaper reported that the airplane's registration papers

	Former SLA Fugitive Free on Bail

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Former Symbionese Liberation Army member  
Kathleen Ann Soliah, accused of planting bombs under police cars 23 
years ago, was granted release from jail today after posting $1 
million bail. The bail was raised by about 250 people, some of whom 
took out lines of credit on their homes and borrowed against 
retirement funds. The court accepted an electronic monitoring plan 
that would allow her to return to her home in St. Paul, Minn., 
while waiting to go on trial in Los Angeles. Charged with 
conspiracy to commit murder and other crimes, she faces a maximum 
sentence of life in prison. The SLA was a radical group that made 
headlines in the 1970s when it kidnapped heiress Patricia Hearst.

Israel ``in the toughest moments in our history.'' Secretary of 
State Madeleine Albright announced she would travel to the Middle 
East ``around the middle of August'' to help restart dormant 
negotiations. House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., however, 
steered away from outright support for President Clinton's aid 
proposals for Israel, saying, ``That will have to go through the

last of four Superfund sites that became a symbol of environmental 
peril in the 1970s. Occidental Chemical and the Olin corporation 
will reimburse the federal government $6 million and New York state 
$610,000 for the cleanup. The companies also agreed to pay $500,000 
for natural resource damages. Some 900 families were uprooted from 
the neighborhood because of thousands of tons of dioxin, PCBs and 
other chemicals at the site.

contraceptive patch for women that is effective for a week. The 
patch, about the size of a half dollar, would be the newest type of 
birth control to hit the U.S. market in several years. Women would 
wear it on their stomachs, arms or buttocks. Once the drug is 
absorbed through the skin, the patch works similarly to birth 
control pills, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Special Loans Approved For Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve Board has approved a plan  
to make special loans to banks, thrifts and credit unions that 
might need emergency money because of consumers' fears about the 
Year 2000 date change. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank's governors on Tuesday voted, 5-0, to offer the  
special loans to financial institutions from Oct. 1 through next 
April 7. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to comments it recently received from the public on  
a proposal, the Fed decided to move up the program's starting date 
from Nov. 1 as first proposed to Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 93 comments received since late May, all but three  
favored the loan program, the Fed noted in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan should help banks, thrifts and credit unions ``more  
confidently commit'' to making loans to other financial 
institutions and to businesses through the transition to the new 
century, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second major step taken by the central bank designed  
to avert possible Year 2000 disruptions in the nation's banking 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year the Fed ordered an additional $50 billion of new  
currency to put into circulation in the event people make a run on 
banks and automated teller machines late in the year. By year's 
end, $200 billion in currency will be stored in government vaults, 
up from the $150 billion normally held in reserve. That's in 
addition to the $460 billion in notes circulating in the United 
States and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	For the special Year 2000 loans, the interest rate charged by  
the Fed will be slightly higher than the prevailing ``federal funds 
rate,'' currently at 4.97 percent, which banks charge each other 
for overnight loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Banking industry officials have said the special loans would  
provide an extra cushion of cash to the system as a backup if 
needed, although the industry anticipates that very few banks will 
have to use it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed has acknowledged that uncertainty surrounds potential  
developments during the transition period because of the millennial 
date change. But it has stressed that it does not expect widespread 
or prolonged computer disruptions from the technology problem, 
caused by the possibility that some computers originally programmed 
to recognize only the last two digits of a year could interpret 
2000 as 1900.

<HEADLINE> IBM's Profits Surge 65 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- IBM's profit beat Wall Street expectations for a  
13th quarter in a row, underscoring how its broad range of 
businesses, from personal computers to advisory services, helps it 
weather downturns in individual product lines. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM reported Monday its second-quarter profits jumped 65  
percent. Strength in PCs and computer services helped offset 
weakness in powerful business machines and computer storage 
devices. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's largest computer company said it earned $2.39  
billion, or $1.28 a share, in the three months ended June 30. That 
was up from a profit of $1.45 billion, or 75 cents a share, in the 
year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	The quarterly profit included an after-tax gain of $700 million  
from IBM's sale of its Global Network data networking business to 
AT&AMP;T Corp. and other one-time actions. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding that impact, IBM earned 91 cents per share, slightly  
beating the 88 cents per share forecast by analysts surveyed by 
First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM's revenue greatly exceeded expectations, as it surged 16  
percent to $21.91 billion from $18.82 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``On balance, I would say I was really pleased with the  
quarter,'' said George Elling, an analyst with Lehman Brothers Inc. 
``The 16 percent revenue growth was certainly excellent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, IBM shares were down 3 percent this morning amid a  
broader retreat in technology stocks. In early trading on the New 
York Stock Exchange, IBM was down $4.62 1/2 a share at $130. Its 
results were released at the close of markets Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Armonk, N.Y.-based IBM said revenue from hardware rose 22  
percent to $9.38 billion. The company partly credited a 50 percent 
rise in quarterly PC sales against the year-ago period, when 
desktops suffered a slowdown, and strength in mainframe sales. 
</P>
<P>
	John Jones, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney Inc., said he  
expects PC sales in the second half to grow further, though not at 
the rapid pace of the first six months. IBM currently sells 
computers directly to about 200 large businesses, expanding a more 
efficient sales method that cuts out the middleman. 
</P>
<P>
	However, sales were weak in IBM's AS 400 line of servers,  
business computers that run networks of smaller machines, due to 
slow demand in Europe. IBM also suffered from price wars in 
hard-disk drives, devices that store computer information, and 
memory chips. IBM is in the process of exiting the memory-chip 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Global services, in which IBM helps corporations set up and run  
their computer networks, continued a string of double-digit sales 
increases, increasing 15 percent to $8 billion from $7 billion. 
Demonstrating the strength, IBM hired 5,000 people in the services 
unit in the quarter, for a services work force totaling 130,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue from software rose 9 percent to $3.1 billion. IBM cited  
strength in sales of database software, Lotus Notes and its Tivoli 
business management software. 
</P>
<P>
	In the six months ended June 30, IBM said its profit rose 55  
percent to $3.86 billion, or $2.05 a share, from $2.49 billion, or 
$1.28 a share. Revenue grew 16 percent to $42.22 billion from 
$36.44 billion.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Bears Waive Erik Kramer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- Erik Kramer knew the day would come  
when he'd have to let rookie Cade McNown take over as the Chicago 
Bears' starting quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	He figured that day would be sometime next year, or later this  
season, at least. 
</P>
<P>
	He had no idea it would be two days before training camp.  
</P>
<P>
	``We all get tossed out like last year's lettuce at some point.  
I didn't think it would be this year,'' he said. ``Maybe it's just 
the nature of the business. If there was any doubt how cold-blooded 
this is, it's apparent now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After weeks of being told he'd be the No. 1 quarterback, Kramer  
was released Tuesday. It was a stunning move, especially since he 
worked out for the Bears on Sunday and was told Monday that he 
passed his physical. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like winning the lotto, but in reverse,'' he said. ``I  
had no idea. This came out of nowhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer missed the last eight games of last season with shoulder  
and knee injuries that required surgery, but that wasn't the reason 
for waiving him, said Mark Hatley, Chicago's vice president of 
player personnel. Neither was money, though Kramer had two years 
left on a three-year, $9 million deal that included a $2 million 
signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	This was simply about football, Hatley and new coach Dick Jauron  
said. McNown and the Bears' three other quarterbacks -- Shane 
Matthews, Jim Miller and Moses Moreno -- were impressive during the 
spring minicamps, making Kramer expendable. 
</P>
<P>
	``On paper, clearly, it's a big move. It's a big move for the  
organization,'' Jauron said. ``We like the way these guys are 
progressing. ... We made the decision to go this way because of 
what we think we have at this position, the potential.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer's departure does not mean McNown, the 12th pick in this  
year's draft, automatically gets the starter's job. He doesn't even 
have a contract yet, though agent Tom Condon -- Kramer's agent, too 
-- was at Halas Hall for more negotiations Tuesday, and Hatley said 
he expects McNown to sign before camp starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Jauron doesn't want to put too much pressure on McNown, so he  
and Matthews will split duty with the No. 1 unit to start training 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is our future. We want to make sure we handle him the right  
way,'' Jauron said. ``We want to make sure he is ready to play at 
this level. It's clearly very different from anything he's seen 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you it's going to be Cade's (job) at some time,''  
he added. ``I don't know when that will be. I don't think you'll be 
able to hold him off for long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he thought McNown was ready to start, Kramer shrugged.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know. But they've made a decision to go in his  
direction now,'' Kramer said. ``Hey, if you're a parent and your 
14-year-old comes home with a straight-A report card, that doesn't 
mean you give him the keys to the car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer, 34, is the Bears' career passing leader with an 80.7  
rating. He led the Bears in passing last year despite missing eight 
games, throwing for 1,823 yards and nine touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	In five years in Chicago, he threw for 10,582 yards and 63  
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing easy about this decision,'' Hatley said. ``We  
came up with a feeling this was best for the Chicago Bears.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But that explanation doesn't make much sense to Kramer.  
</P>
<P>
	``How do you go from No. 1 to No. 5?'' he asked. ``If they think  
I'm the fifth-best quarterback on this roster, they're crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer said he knew his past injuries -- he missed all but four  
games in 1996 with a neck injury -- might have worried the Bears. So 
he told them last winter that if they wanted to do something 
different at quarterback, just to let him know. 
</P>
<P>
	That never happened, Kramer said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to say I was lied to, but I don't know,'' he  
said. ``Obviously, I wasn't being treated honestly.''

<HEADLINE> Superdome To Get Grass Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- For New Orleans Saints linebacker Marc  
Lillibridge, pro football games on artificial turf inside domed 
stadiums are just too tidy. He'd rather play on grass and get 
dirty. 
</P>
<P>
	Lillibridge will get his chance next month when workers roll out  
a grass field in the Louisiana Superdome for the Aug. 28 exhibition 
game against the Green Bay Packers. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the first game test of a rug developed by an Alabama  
company, and thought to be the first use of a grass field for an 
NFL game in a domed stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	When the game is over, employees of Southern Turf Nurseries will  
roll up the turf and return it Robertsdale, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	The company hopes to prove the removable grass could be just as  
easily shipped to a field near New Orleans, rejuvenated by sun and 
water, and returned to the Superdome for every home game. 
</P>
<P>
	Lillibridge, who practiced briefly on the company's grass during  
a demonstration last December at the Saints' Metairie headquarters, 
is looking forward to playing on a soft field and getting grass 
stains on his jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it does hold up well, it could be the start of something  
big,'' he said. ``It's the way football is supposed to be played.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astrodome in Houston was the pioneer domed stadium and  
sported the world's first indoor grass field when it opened in 
1965. But most of that sod died by season's end after a section of 
skylights was painted to reduce glare. 
</P>
<P>
	Astroturf, the first artificial playing surface, debuted July  
19, 1966, and has lined the stadium's floor ever since. The Astros 
will return to grass next season when its new retractable-roof 
stadium opens. 
</P>
<P>
	Although artificial turf allows players to run faster, many say  
they prefer grass because it's easier on their ankles and knees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Grass tends to give a little more,'' Lillibridge said.  
</P>
<P>
	When the Packers decided that all their exhibition games will be  
played on grass, the Saints and the Superdome arranged a test of 
Southern Turf's product, Saints spokesmen Greg Bensel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bensel and Southern Turf spokeswoman Laurie Barnett declined to  
say how much the test will cost. Southern Turf is supplying the 
grass and the workers to roll it out. The Saints are picking up 
transportation costs, while the Superdome and the NFL are providing 
workers and paint to dress up the field for the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The field will be fashioned of 250 8-by-50 foot rolled sections  
of turf weighing up to 8,000 pounds apiece, Barnett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Southern Turf's idea is to remove the grass after games so  
stadiums can be used for concerts and other events requiring hard 
floors, Barnett said. 
</P>
<P>
	The grass would be trucked to fields up to 20 miles away from  
the stadiums, and rolled out to soak up sunshine and rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Superdome general manager Doug Thornton says the process would  
expensive. The time it takes to move the grass in and out could 
also cut into other events at the Superdome, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, the jury's still out,'' Thornton said. ``It has a  
definite application for a one-time special event like the Super 
Bowl. But when you're taking about using it week to week, it's a 
challenge.''

<HEADLINE> Brokerage Insurance Fund Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The insurance fund created by federal law to  
protect investors if their brokerage firm goes bust isn't doing its 
job and Congress should intervene, a group of lawyers who represent 
investors charged today. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization is accusing the fund -- the Securities Investor  
Protection Corp. or SIPC -- of hiring Wall Street attorneys with 
potential conflicts of interest to investigate investor fraud 
claims. The result is that SIPC pays out little to fraud victims, 
says the 375-member group, called the Public Investors Arbitration 
Bar Association. 
</P>
<P>
	SIPC is ``doing everything in its power to deny claims rather  
than protect investor assets,'' Mark Maddox, the group's president, 
said at a news conference. ``It's time for Congress to shake up 
SIPC and get it back where it's supposed to be: on the side of the 
small investor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Wall Street attorneys hand-picked by SIPC are paid millions of  
dollars while ... stock fraud victims only get insult added to 
injury,'' Maddox said. 
</P>
<P>
	The PIABA also contends that the insurance fund isn't helping  
many investors who have been hurt by recent cases of small-stock 
fraud because its legal charter doesn't cover them. 
</P>
<P>
	The group is asking for a study of SIPC by the General  
Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, or congressional 
hearings. The group also is pushing for federal legislation 
expanding SIPC's charter. 
</P>
<P>
	One investor, Fred Brown of Wyethville, Va., said brokers  
emptied his account of nearly $160,000 in the fall of 1996 while he 
was in Costa Rica on a business trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, SIPC rejected his claim for losses against the brokerage  
firm, Brown said, because he hadn't complained in writing to the 
firm within 10 days of the occurrence of unauthorized trades on his 
account. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of money disappeared in a short time,'' said Brown, 58,  
who owns a motorcycle dealership. 
</P>
<P>
	When he opened his brokerage account, he said, he had assumed  
that SIPC coverage was similar to that provided by the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corp. for bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	SIPC's general counsel defended its record Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've never failed to pay a documented claim,'' said Stephen  
Harbeck. That has amounted to $333 million in claims paid to 
investors in 278 brokerage firm failures since SIPC was created by 
law in 1970, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	SIPC is an independent corporation that is funded by the  
securities industry. Roughly 7,500 brokerage firms each currently 
pay $150 a year regardless of their size. 
</P>
<P>
	SIPC's role is similar to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,  
which insures bank deposits, but SIPC doesn't have regulatory 
powers exercised by the FDIC. 
</P>
<P>
	The Public Investors Arbitration Bar Association is made up of  
lawyers who represent investors in disputes with brokerage firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Under current law, investors who believe they've been defrauded  
by a brokerage firm can go to an arbitration panel administered by 
the National Association of Securities Dealers, the industry's 
self-regulatory group. 
</P>
<P>
	If the investor wins and the brokerage firm is bankrupt, SIPC  
takes responsibility for the claim. 
</P>
<P>
	But it only pays claims for fraud involving stolen money or  
unauthorized trading by brokers in customers' accounts, not other 
types of abuse such as making false claims about stocks or refusing 
to sell them for customers. 
</P>
<P>
	When a brokerage firm fails and is liquidated, the bankruptcy  
judge appoints a trustee -- often chosen by SIPC -- to oversee the 
process, including determining whether investors' claims of 
financial losses are legitimate. Because the trustees often are 
attorneys from big Wall Street firms with securities industry 
clients, PIABA contends they could be biased toward the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The association is proposing that trustees, who receive legal  
fees from SIPC if the failed brokerage's assets are depleted, be 
selected by someone other than SIPC. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the association's major complaints concerns the  
now-defunct Stratton Oakmont Inc., a brokerage firm based in Lake 
Success, N.Y., that specialized in low-cost ``penny'' stocks but 
was booted out of the industry in December 1996 for allegedly 
defrauding customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission won a $2.5 million  
settlement in 1994 after it sued Stratton Oakmont, charging 
fraudulent sales practices, which regulators said often included 
brokers failing to sell stocks as requested by customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 3,000 investors sought a total $130 million in damages, but  
SIPC rejected most of the claims. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge ruled last October that Stratton Oakmont  
investors making claims of fraudulent failure to sell wouldn't be 
allowed to collect money from SIPC because those abuses aren't 
covered under its charter. Harbeck, the SIPC general counsel, said 
many of the investors haven't submitted sufficient documentation 
showing unauthorized trading in their accounts.

<HEADLINE> Union Ratifies Pact With ABC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The union representing behind-the-scenes network  
employees at ABC announced Tuesday that five bargaining units that 
had rejected a contract proposal earlier this year have now 
ratified the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	After reaching a tentative agreement with the network last  
month, the National Association of Broadcast Employees and 
Technicians submitted the contract to a vote by 1,400 of its 
members in New York, Washington, Chicago, Los Angeles and San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The new contracts will now become part of the master agreement  
between ABC and NABET, which represents 2,400 camera operators, 
engineers, producers and other workers at the network. That 
agreement, which runs through March 31, 2003, covers those five 
units as well as the seven units already under contract after 
ratifying the package in February. 
</P>
<P>
	The affected NABET members had been working without a contract  
since March 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The lengthy dispute turned rancorous in November when a one-day  
strike over health benefits led to a lockout of the workers by ABC. 
During the 11-week lockout, ABC used temporary workers while NABET 
members walked picket lines. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for ABC did not immediately return a call for  
comment.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Action on Test Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton urged the Senate today to  
act on a long-stalled treaty to ban nuclear testing, saying the 
United States' failure to act jeopardizes an agreement signed by 
152 nations. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it would be ``a grave error'' for the treaty to be  
derailed because of a dispute with some senators over two unrelated 
treaties. ``Unfortunately, the test-ban treaty is now imperiled by 
the refusal of some senators even to consider it,'' the president 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, in an appearance in the Rose Garden, spoke up as part  
of a new drive by Democrats and Republicans alike to dislodge the 
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty from the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee. Clinton signed the treaty in 1996. Now the treaty has 
been signed by 152 countries, and 41 of them have ratified it. 
</P>
<P>
	``At a minimum,'' Clinton said, ``the Senate Foreign Relations  
Committee should hold hearings this fall. Hearings would allow each 
side to make its case for and against the treaty, and allow the 
Senate to decide this matter on the merits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a chance right now to end nuclear testing forever,''  
the president said. ``It would be a tragedy for our security and 
for our children's future to let this opportunity slip away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the treaty, all 44 states with some nuclear capacity must  
sign for it to take effect. Even one holdout could doom the treaty. 
So far, only 18 nations with nuclear capabilities have acted. 
</P>
<P>
	The treaty is bottled up in the Foreign Relations Committee by  
its chairman, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Before moving on the test-ban treaty, Helms wants the  
administration to first submit to the Senate modifications in the 
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty agreed to three years ago by Clinton 
and Yeltsin. The administration says it will submit the 
modifications, but only after Russia ratifies START II. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms also wants the administration to submit the climate treaty  
negotiated in Kyoto, Japan, in December 1997, even though it would 
likely be defeated. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the ABM and climate treaties ``are literally not  
ripe for presentation to the Senate yet'' and it would be a ``grave 
error'' to delay the test-ban treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the test-ban treaty say it would lock in U.S.  
superiority gained by more than 1,000 nuclear tests during the Cold 
War. Failing to ratify the pact could open the door to additional 
nuclear tests by India, Pakistan or other nations, the supporters 
claim. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents argue it could threaten America's ability to deliver  
an effective nuclear strike, if one is ever needed.

<HEADLINE> Alcatel Rebuffs BNP in France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Alcatel won't tender its stake in Societe Generale  
to Banque Nationale de Paris, which is in a prolonged battle to 
take over the banks Societe General and Paribas. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcatel Chairman Serge Tchuruk said today the telecommunications  
group favors the merger planned by Societe Generale and Paribas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Alcatel believes that the best project is the SG-Paribas  
merger,'' Tchuruk said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The SG-Paribas project has ``greater industrial feasibility,''  
Tchuruk said. He added that he was skeptical that a three-way 
merger ``where the parties seem to be in a conflict situation'' 
could succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	Tchuruk is a board member of Paribas and as of December 1998,  
Alcatel held a 2 percent to 3 percent stake in Societe Generale. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcatel's backing of the SG-Paribas deal comes on the heels of  
Monday's announcement by French drinks group Pernod Ricard that it 
will not tender the shares it owns in Societe Generale to BNP. 
</P>
<P>
	BNP has been waging a five-month takeover fight for Societe  
Generale and Paribas even though Societe Generale prefers its own 
deal to take over Paribas in a friendly merger. 
</P>
<P>
	The takeover fight began in March when BNP offered $37 billion  
for the two banks after they had already agreed on a deal. Societe 
Generale and Paribas rejected BNP's offer and have spurned its 
advances since then. 
</P>
<P>
	On July 1, the BNP increased its initial bid by five percent.  
</P>
<P>
	A merger of the three banks would create the world's first $1  
trillion bank in terms of assets.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Nine wheelchair racers have accused the New York  
Road Runners Club of making them second-class athletes at the New 
York City Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
	Racers say that for the past several years they have been  
unfairly stopped and rerouted at various points along the 26.2-mile 
course. 
</P>
<P>
	The racers are seeking unspecified monetary damages and a court  
order requiring equal treatment of wheelchair athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, police followed organizers' instructions and halted  
30 wheelchair racers for up to 30 minutes in the middle of the race 
so that foot racers and vehicles could pass, according to the 
federal lawsuit filed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes you right out of your race,'' said plaintiff Bob  
Neumeyer, 52, who has raced in 13 New York marathons. ``Can you 
imagine if they did that to runners? They'd be screaming their 
heads off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allan Steinfeld, president and race director of the Runners  
Club, which stages the annual event, did not immediately return 
telephone calls for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiffs also contend that unlike other major marathons in  
Boston and elsewhere, the New York event violates the federal 
Americans with Disabilities Act by not creating a division with 
separate prizes for wheelchair racers. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit alleges that last November's first- and second-place  
wheelchair finishers -- plaintiffs Miguel Such, 25, and Tony 
Nogueira, 31 -- ``received no recognition, no acclaim, no publicity 
and were not even permitted to cross the finish line.''

<HEADLINE> GM Reports Record Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp., benefiting from increased  
sales of light trucks in North America, reported $1.73 billion in 
second-quarter operating profits, up more than fivefold from 
strike-depressed results of a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's No. 1 automaker earned $2.66 a share, compared with  
$306 million, or 40 cents a share, in the same period of 1998 after 
excluding earnings from GM's former parts unit, Delphi Automotive 
Systems. GM spun Delphi off in May. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's earnings exceeded Wall Street analysts' expectations. The  
average estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. was 
$2.56 a share. GM's stock was little changed in response to the 
report, trading down 31 1/4 cents at $68 a share on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales totaled $45.1 billion, compared with adjusted revenue of  
$37.3 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	As was the case with Ford Motor Co., which reported strong North  
American results last week, GM earned the bulk of its profit from 
robust sales in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``In one of the most intensely competitive markets in recent  
history, our North American automotive operations took advantage of 
the strong demand and recorded net income of $1.5 billion, despite 
the extremely tough pricing environment in this key region,'' 
chairman Jack Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM benefited from selling more of its high-profit pickups and  
sport utility vehicles. Second-quarter light truck production was 
increased to its highest level in five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were producing about everything they could,'' said  
analyst David Healy of Burnham Securities Inc. ``They had a lot of 
high-profit trucks in the mix and they succeeded in cutting costs 
versus a year ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM president G. Richard Wagoner Jr. said cost-cutting also was a  
factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our focus on cost reduction and success in the marketplace  
lead to continued strong financial results,'' Wagoner said. ``We 
are seeing our momentum build in the United States, and we're 
especially pleased that our market share topped 30 percent in the 
last month of the quarter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM's North American manufacturing operations are designed to  
operate profitably to fulfill 30 percent of the U.S. car and light 
truck market. The automaker has struggled to regain market share 
since last summer's strikes virtually halted GM's North American 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Rod Lache of Deutsche Bank Securities said the rise in  
market share was a hopeful sign. 
</P>
<P>
	``The negative is it's costing them money -- marketing costs are  
going up,'' Lache said. ``At this point it looks like marketing 
costs have been offset by higher volumes and cost savings, but 
there's only so far that can go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM also showed improvement in Europe, where operating earnings  
of $187 million represented a 51 percent improvement over the $124 
million earned a year ago. GM credited strong sales of its new Opel 
and Vauxhall Zafira minivan and redesigned Opel Astra subcompact. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, GM lost money.  
</P>
<P>
	In the Asia-Pacific region, GM's loss totaled $81 million,  
compared with a $36 million loss in the same period of 1998. In 
Latin America, Africa and the Mideast, GM lost $38 million, 
compared with a $48 million profit a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first half of the year, GM's worldwide operating  
earnings totaled nearly $4 billion, or $5.33 a share, double the $2 
billion, or $2.33 a share, in the first half of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue totaled $87.5 billion, up 13 percent from $77.3 billion  
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's earnings in the second quarter of 1998 were affected by  
strikes at two parts plants in Flint, Mich., which cost the company 
an estimated $890 million, or $1.32 a share, after taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Including Delphi earnings, GM earned $1.9 billion, or $294 a  
share, in the recent quarter, compared with $389 million, or 52 
cents a share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's cash horde totaled $16.7 billion at the end of June, up  
from $11 billion a year ago and $16.2 billion at the end of the 
first quarter. Those figures exclude GM's financing and insurance 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Acceptance Corp., the automaker's finance unit,  
earned $391 million during the second quarter, up 7 percent from 
$365 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's Hughes Electronics unit lost $92 million in the second  
quarter, compared with a $56 million profit in the same period of 
1998. The results were affected by a $125 million pretax charge for 
increased development costs and delays at Hughes Space and 
Communications Co., its satellite unit.

<HEADLINE> Lucent Revenues Rise 22 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MURRAY HILL, N.J. (AP) -- Lucent Technologies Inc. credited its  
growing microelectronics business, strong international sales and 
its recent $18.7 billion acquisition of Ascend Communications 
Tuesday for better-than-expected earnings and a 22 percent increase 
in third-quarter revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	For the quarter, the telecommunications company earned $750  
million, or 24 cents a share on a diluted basis, compared with a 
loss of $150 million, or 5 cents a share, during the same period a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues were $9.13 billion, up from $7.64 billion a year ago.  
Revenues for the first nine months ended June 30 were up 19 percent 
to $27.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The net income for the three months ended June 30 includes a  
one-time charge of $79 million associated with the Ascend merger, 
which was finalized last month. The year-ago figures includes 
after-tax charges of $668 million related to the acquisitions of 
two other communications companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings exceeded Wall Street analysts expectations of 23  
cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Lucent, the world's No. 1 maker of telephone equipment, said  
that its international revenues were up 48 percent for the calendar 
year and 51 percent for the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Carriers around the world are investing in next-generation  
networks at an unprecedented pace,'' said Richard McGinn, Lucent 
Technologies chairman and chief executive officer. ``And, as 
today's results demonstrate, they're turning to Lucent to build 
these networks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McGinn also said Lucent's microelectronics business spurred the  
company's growth. Revenues increased 23 percent on sales of 
customized chips for high-speed communications and wireless and 
data networking systems. The company also introduced a chip for 
Internet telephones that would cut semiconductor costs for those 
telephones by up to 30 percent and reduce the number of chips 
needed from five t one.

<HEADLINE> MTV, RioPort Team for Internet Music </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- MTV Networks Online will team with RioPort Inc.  
to offer the secure downloading of music over MTV's Web sites in an 
early venture to capitalize on the predicted wave of music sales 
over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	MTV Networks Online will provide content and promotion for the  
Web sites, while RioPort will provide the software and hardware for 
managing the music downloads and transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the agreement weren't disclosed, but MTV Networks  
Online said in a statement Tuesday that it will have an equity 
stake in RioPort and will share in revenues from Web site sales of 
digitally downloaded music. 
</P>
<P>
	MTV's online properties include MTV.com, VH1.com, Nick.com and  
SonicNet. The companies plan to begin selling music on the Web 
sites at the end of this year, using the recently adopted Secure 
Digital Music Initiative (SDMI) specifications designed to prevent 
music piracy. Universal Music Group, the world's largest music 
company, is the first record label to agree to offer music for 
download on the MTV sites. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate move announced Monday, 44 recording artists,  
including acts such as the Rolling Stones, Tom Petty and Metallica, 
agreed to take an equity interest in Artistdirect, an Encino, 
Calif.-based company that sells CDs, videotapes and other 
merchandise over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	RioPort, the San Jose, Calif.-based subsidiary of Diamond  
Multimedia Systems, Inc., is the developer the Rio player, a 
handheld device that plays the music downloaded from the Internet 
in the MP3 format. The device will be able to play the encrypted 
music downloaded from the Web sites.

<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- First Data Corp. is selling its Investor Services  
Group to PNC Bank Corp. for $1.1 billion in cash.

<HEADLINE> American Retail To Close Uptons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORCROSS, Ga. (AP) -- American Retail Group Inc. will close its  
chain of 75 Uptons department stores, eliminating more than 4,000 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The privately held American Retail said that it was unable to  
find outside investors to help fund the chain's growth and 
determined it was too expensive to keep Uptons running, said 
spokesman Shira Weissman. 
</P>
<P>
	American Retail, which is controlled by the Brennikmeyer family,  
has decided instead to focus on its core retail chains, including 
Eastern Mountain Sports, Millers Outpost and Maurices. 
</P>
<P>
	Uptons has struggled to compete in the crowded retail  
marketplace. Like other moderately priced department store chains 
such as Sears and J.C. Penney, Uptons has been losing customers to 
discount chains like Wal-Mart and Target that offer a wider 
selection and cheaper prices. 
</P>
<P>
	American Retail expects the store closings to be completed by  
the end of the year. In addition to the Uptons stores -- which are 
located in seven states in the Southeast -- and the Uptons 
headquarters in Norcross, Ga., the company will close distribution 
centers in Georgia and Florida.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Profits Up 62 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft Corp.'s newest upgrade to its Office  
suite of business software is off to a strong start, executives 
say, and helped the company to a 62 percent increase in 
fourth-quarter profits. 
</P>
<P>
	But in a more cautious tone than usual Monday, the company's  
chief financial officer, Greg Maffei, warned that that rate of 
growth would be difficult to sustain in the coming year as personal 
computer sales slow, Year 2000 computer problems linger and 
Microsoft makes hefty investments in new arenas. 
</P>
<P>
	Maffei said revenue growth for fiscal year 2000 likely would be  
in the high teens, compared to 29 percent in fiscal 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The warning sent Microsoft shares down in early trading on the  
Nasdaq Stock Market. Microsoft stock was down 3 percent, falling 
$2.87 1/2 a share at $95.50, at mid morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, which dominates the personal computer software  
industry, reported net income of $2.2 billion or 40 cents a diluted 
share, compared with profits of $1.36 billion or 25 cents a diluted 
share a year earlier. Revenue for the quarter ended June 30 was 
$5.76 billion, up 39 percent from $4.15 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had predicted earnings of  
36 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a darn good showing,'' said Scott McAdams, president  
of McAdams Wright Ragen in Seattle. The profit ``is a pretty good 
number by any measure relative to a year ago,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, based in suburban Redmond, released Office 2000 for  
sale in mid-June, after hundreds of thousands of users had been 
familiarizing themselves with pre-release versions of the 
industry-standard business software package. It also brought out a 
newer version of its Windows 98 operating system for personal 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Continuing consumer demand for Microsoft Windows and Office  
drove another year of fine financial performance,'' Maffei said. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he cautioned, ``I think we are entering into a slower  
growth environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many companies are concentrating on preparing for the year 2000  
change and may postpone making large software investments, Maffei 
said. Microsoft also is making large investments in research and 
development, and in sales and support, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In just the area of cable, telephone and other communications  
services, Microsoft invested more than $6 billion in the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	``In fiscal 2000, our revenue growth rates will decline due to  
slowing PC demand, uncertainty surrounding Y2K and uncertain global 
economic conditions, and we will not see further margin 
expansion,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft is known for extremely conservative estimates of its  
future performance, and, ``This year's commentary is more 
conservative than normal,'' McAdams said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Microsoft became the first corporation to achieve a  
market capitalization of a half-trillion dollars, as anticipation 
of the earnings report and speculation that Microsoft may create a 
separate ``tracking stock'' for its Internet properties sent the 
share price soaring. 
</P>
<P>
	Maffei told industry analysts in a conference call that  
Microsoft was reviewing that possibility but, ``We have no imminent 
plans to announce such a structure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft did not give exact sales figures for the new version  
of Office. However, for the quarter, Microsoft's productivity 
software segment showed operating revenues of $2.93 billion, up 
nearly 48 percent from $2 billion for the same quarter a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	For the fiscal year, Microsoft had net income of $7.79 billion  
or $1.42 a share on revenues of $19.75 billion, compared with 
profits of $4.49 billion or 84 cents a share on revenues of $15.26 
billion in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Europe: Dollar, Gold Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The dollar fell against other major currencies in  
European trading Tuesday morning. Gold prices also were lower. 
</P>
<P>
	After weeks of record lows, the euro surged on  
better-than-expected German financial data and closed at $1.0368, 
up from $1.0147 Monday and its highest level since June 28. In 
midday trading in New York, the euro traded at $1.0403. 
</P>
<P>
	Dealers credited a rise in the business sentiment index put out  
by the German think tank Ifo, which hit 92.9 in June, compared to 
90.5 in May, well above the 91.2 forecast. That fueled expectations 
that the euro-zone economy could expand strongly in the second half 
of the year, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Munich-based Ifo tracks sentiment and prospects in the  
manufacturing, construction and wholesaling sectors. 
</P>
<P>
	Other dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday included  
119.38 Japanese yen, down from 119.57; 1.5460 Swiss francs, down 
from 1.5827; 1.4898 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4920. 
</P>
<P>
	The British pound was quoted at $1.5682, up from $1.5593.  
</P>
<P>
	In afternoon trading in New York, the dollar bought 118.97 yen,  
and the pound was worth $1.569. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately, though they remain in use. Based on euro 
rates, the dollar is worth 1.8864 German marks, down from 1.9275; 
6.3267 French francs, down from 6.4645; 2.1255 Dutch guilders, up

<HEADLINE> Sens. Accuse Sweepstakes Operators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some small sweepstakes companies that are  
running their businesses within the letter of the law nevertheless 
are taking in millions of dollars by misleading consumers into 
buying questionable products, senators say. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's more apparent than ever that something must be done,''  
Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, told operators of two sweepstakes 
companies who appeared before a Senate subcommittee Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Changes are going to be made here,'' Sen. Richard Durbin,  
D-Ill., said, referring to legislation that would toughen laws 
regulating sweepstakes. The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee 
approved the bill, sponsored by Collins, in May and it now awaits a 
vote by the full Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	During a hearing before the committee's permanent subcommittee  
on investigations, the company officials explained how they 
operated and denied that their mail solicitations are misleading. 
</P>
<P>
	David Dobin, president of Lone Star Promotions Inc. of Merrick,  
N.Y., said he takes care to stay within the law. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how anyone can complain that Lone Star unfairly  
enticed them to purchase something they didn't want,'' Dobin said. 
``We clearly explain what it is we are selling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dobin has pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit  
mail fraud involving another company. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Kasday, president of Neopolitan Consultants Inc. of Las  
Vegas, cited his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination 
and declined twice to answer questions sharply delivered by 
Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasday would not explain why an artists' rendering of a seal on  
a sweepstakes promotion, followed by the words ``J. Remington 
Astor, Prize Registrar, My appt. exp. Aug. 29, 2000'' appears to 
closely resemble the seal of a notary public stamp on another page. 
</P>
<P>
	No one named ``J. Remington Astor'' actually exists, he said. He  
also declined to explain why he was not troubled by the possibility 
that the artists' seal would mislead people to believe it conferred 
legal status on the promotion. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Collins' bill, sweepstakes that use deception to lure  
people into buying magazine subscriptions or other products by mail 
could be fined up to $2 million. It is designed to curb sweepstakes 
that may be in compliance with the letter of law but dupe people 
into thinking they can improve their chances of winning by buying 
the company's products. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweepstakes offers also would be required to state accurately  
the value of prizes offered, the odds of winning and the name of 
the sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins said most people are familiar with the giant sweepstakes  
promotions offered by Publishers Clearing House and American Family 
Publishers. But little is known about smaller companies, which sent 
out an estimated 100 million sweepstakes offers last year and rang 
up more than $40 million in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigation by the Senate panel turned up evidence that  
some of their sales pitches are even more deceptive than mailings 
sent out by bigger sweepstakes sponsors and sometimes cross the 
line into illegality. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins said some mailings easily can be misunderstood to mean  
that a recipient had won a prize of several thousand dollars when 
winning actually would produce a prize worth only a few cents -- or 
none at all.

post a 13 percent increase in profits for the second quarter.

<P>
	The company on Tuesday reported net income of $105 million, or  
81 cents per, up from $92 million, or 72 cents per share, a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The results beat Wall Street analysts' expectations of 80 cents  
per share, according to First Call Corp., a financial research 
network. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the quarter that ended July 4 were $1.38 billion,  
up from $1.18 billion in the second quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was another excellent quarter, bolstered by the results  
of our acquisition strategy and strong internal growth,'' said 
Nicholas D. Chabraja, chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's Marine Systems group saw a 30 percent revenue  
increase, largely because of the purchase of National Steel and 
Shipbuilding Co. General Dynamics acquired San Diego-based NASSCO 
on Nov. 10, 1998. The company's other shipbuilding operations 
include Electric Boat, Bath Iron Works and National Steel and 
Shipbuilding Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Second-quarter revenue in the Combat Systems segment were $306  
million, up from $298 million. The Information Systems and 
Technology group reported revenue of $243 million, up from $228 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falls Church, Va.-based defense contractor makes nuclear  
submarines and the Aegis class of warships for the Navy, and the M1 
Abrams battle tank for the Army. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of the year, the company had profits of  
$370 million, or $2.87 per share -- a 110 percent increase over the 
$174 million, or $1.37 per share, for the same period a year ago. 
The 1999 figure includes a one-time gain of $165 million, or $1.29 
per share, from a research and development tax credit.

<HEADLINE> New Browns To Gather This Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- They're from all over the NFL map, 90 guys who  
played somewhere else last season. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, they'll begin making history together as the new  
Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Returning to the league as an expansion team in 1999 following a  
three-year absence, the Browns on Wednesday will be the first team 
to open its summer training camp, when rookies report to 
Cleveland's Berea, Ohio, headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, quarterback Tim Couch, the No. 1 overall pick in  
April's college draft, and Cleveland's other first-year players 
will have their first workout under the watchful eye of coach Chris 
Palmer and 15 assistants. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll put the rookies in pads and let them knock each other  
around a little bit,'' Palmer said Tuesday. ``We also want to see 
what they've remembered from the mini-camps and make sure they've 
done their homework.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team's veterans are due to report Friday and the new Browns  
will have their first full-squad workout on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	From the moment the Browns take the practice field in their  
traditional orange logo-less helmets, Cleveland fans will finally 
be able to put three long years of life without pro football behind 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the overwhelming interest in the team's return, the  
Browns are making all of their practices open to the public. There 
will be 4,500 tickets given out each day for the camp, which runs 
until Aug. 23, and the team is expecting many of the sessions to 
sell out. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I got the job, Bill Parcells told me, `You're going to a  
great football town,''' Palmer said. ``But until I got here, I 
didn't realize just how great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This will be Palmer's first NFL training camp as a coach after  
spending the past two seasons as the Jacksonville Jaguars' 
offensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	From the time he gets his full team together on Sunday, Palmer  
will have just two weeks to prepare the Browns for their Aug. 9 
debut against the Dallas Cowboys in the Hall of Fame game at 
Canton, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Just 12 days later, the team will open its home exhibition  
season and the new, 70,000-seat Cleveland Browns Stadium against 
the Minnesota Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got some work to do,'' Palmer said.

<HEADLINE> Charges Vs. Denny McLain Dropped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- Conspiracy and fraud charges against  
former baseball star Dennis McLain, who was indicted with John A. 
``Junior'' Gotti, have been dropped, lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution concluded that proving the case ``would be very  
difficult'' and filed papers today withdrawing the charges against 
McLain, Anthony Plomitallo and Michael Zambouros. 
</P>
<P>
	McLain, 55, the last major league pitcher to win 30 games, will  
return from the Westchester County Jail, where he had been awaiting 
trial, to the federal prison in Lewis Run, Pa. He must serve about 
five more years of an eight-year sentence for a meatpackers' 
pension-fund swindle. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's happy now that this is behind him and now he's looking to  
just going back to the institution and doing what he has to do to 
get out,'' said his lawyer, Domenick Porco. 
</P>
<P>
	McLain, Plomitallo, 35, of Mineola, and Zambouros, 55, of  
Jupiter, Fla., were indicted last year with 36 other men in a 
roundup of alleged organized crime figures. The three men, with 
Gotti, allegedly had concocted a scheme to sell worthless telephone 
calling cards. Porco said McLain had actually been victimized by a 
lender who kept McLain's payments to MCI. 
</P>
<P>
	McLain was the only one not charged with racketeering and Porco  
worked hard to keep the baseball star from being tried with the 
notorious Gotti. McLain, much heavier than in his playing days, 
attended many of the pretrial court sessions with Gotti. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time Gotti pleaded guilty this year to racketeering and  
other charges -- the phone-card charges were dropped -- McLain had 
been separated from his case. Gotti's sentencing is scheduled for 
Sept. 3.

<HEADLINE> Boston Works Out Cuban Free Agent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Juan Carlos Diaz, one of two players declared free  
agents after the Los Angeles Dodgers broke a ban against getting 
them out of Cuba, worked out Tuesday with the Boston Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston general manager Dan Duquette said he was considering  
making an offer to the power hitter, who played with the Dodgers' 
Double-A team in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he believed other teams had held tryouts for Diaz and  
made offers. ``I expect a couple of weeks'' would pass before Diaz 
reached a decision, Duquette said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said the team plans to hold a tryout for Josue Perez,  
the other Cuban declared a free agent late last month by 
commissioner Bud Selig. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dodgers also were fined for breaking rules barring scouting  
in Cuba or engineering defections. 
</P>
<P>
	Diaz is a 24-year-old first baseman, while Perez is a  
21-year-old outfielder who played for Class-A Vero Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Dodgers scout Pablo Peguero reportedly visited Cuba and helped  
the players obtain visas to go to the Dominican Republic, where 
they joined the Dodgers' academy.

	TRAVEL EXPENSE FORECAST: If you're putting together your  
business travel budget for next year, count on expenses rising 
about 4 percent, advises the management consulting firm Runzheimer 
International. The company predicts business air fares will be up 3 
percent, while hotels, meals and car rental will all rise 5 
percent. Runzheimer says corporate travel executives are resisting 
bigger increases, especially at hotels, where it can cost more to 
stay for one night than it does to fly across the country. They're 
also encouraging employees to take one-day round-trips rather than 
stay overnight.

	EXITING EMPLOYEES: When workers leave a company for another job,  
a smart employer will be sure that they're not taking proprietary 
information with them. Ober, Kaler, Grimes &AMP; Shriver, a 
Baltimore-based law firm, suggests employers use an exit interview 
to find out how the departing worker's job duties compare with what 
he or she will be doing in a new position. The employer should also 
be sure that the worker understands that he or she has a duty not 
to use or disclose proprietary information. It's also a good time 
to be sure all company property is returned, and to find out what 
projects the worker has been involved with. And check the worker's 
personal computer to see if files have been illegally copied or 
deleted.

	AUCTION PROTECTION: With online auction sites proliferating,  
FamilyPC magazine has some tips for Internet shoppers who are 
worried about getting burned by dishonest dealers. First, check 
feedback forums and ratings guides, which let buyers know if 
someone has had a bad experience with a seller in the past. Read 
descriptions of the items for sale carefully, and don't buy 
something sight unseen from someone who won't accept returns. Ask 
the seller for references, appraisals and paperwork that attest to 
the authenticity of an item. Use a credit card if you can, which 
will give you some recourse if a seller is dishonest. And before 
you buy, be sure you have an idea of what the item is really worth.

<HEADLINE> SmithKline Profits Rise 16 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Pharmaceutical giant SmithKline Beecham PLC  
on Tuesday reported a 16 percent rise in its second-quarter profit 
after taxes, citing strong sales of several new drug products. 
</P>
<P>
	SmithKline, a London-based company with U.S. headquarters in  
Philadelphia, earned $487 million, or 40 cents per share, in the 
three months ended June 30. That was up from a profit of $433 
million, or 36 cents per share, in the same quarter one year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue grew 11 percent for the quarter, to $3.5 billion from  
$3.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	SmithKline Chief Executive Jan Leschly attributed company growth  
to solid sales of its antibiotics and vaccines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pharmaceuticals growth was once again driven by sales of new  
products, which grew 48 percent, including Avandia, which was 
launched in the U.S. in early June for Type 2 diabetes,'' Leschly 
said. ``In Consumer Healthcare, our growing smoking cessation 
franchise, our oral care products and our nutritional drinks 
delivered solid results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SmithKline is the manufacturer of Nicorette gum and NicoDerm CQ,  
a patch designed to help smokers quit, and LYMErix, the world's 
first Lyme vaccine. The company sells its products in the United 
States and abroad.
