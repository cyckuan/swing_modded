<HEADLINE> China's One-Child Policy Produces Friendlier, More Confident Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Children born during the
two-decade-old "One Couple, One Child" policy are eager to make
friends, more self-confident, more willing to help others and
improve themselves, and have a wider range of interests, latest
survey results said today.
</P>
<P>
The results of a survey conducted by the China Youth Research
Center and the China Youth Development Foundation of more than
3,000 children of one-child families in 12 cities were released
today.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that these so-called "young emperors" do have
some weak-points. Only 12.8 percent have great expectations or
ambition, even though most of the parents want them to amount to
something. This indicates that the child spoiled by parents
doesn't feel the motive of working for a lofty goal quite as
easily.
</P>
<P>
It also showed that 88.4 percent of the children are
narrow-minded, bad-tempered, and are quick to attack anyone who
teases or insults them.
</P>
<P>
Children from one-child families also lack creativity, a sense
of independence, and a willingness to work hard or be thrifty.
</P>
<P>
Only a small part of the children questioned showed a strong
desire for study. This indicates that the present educational
system, with its barrage of tests and exam, has made competition
among school-children too intense and, as a result, has caused
them to lose interest.
</P>
<P>
The researchers said that family education, schooling and
friends are the three most important factors in children's morals,
and they suggest that the present educational system be changed,
with greater importance being placed on providing healthier
natures in children from one-child families.

<HEADLINE> Iran Scores World Record in World Cup Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The soccer's world governing body
said on Tuesday that Iran has set a world record as it blanked the
Maldives 17-0 in an Asian zone qualifier on Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, its striker Karim Bakeri's seven-goal spree could not
yet be recognised as a world record since details of early World
Cup qualifiers were still incomplete.
</P>
<P>
The incredible mark of 17-0 set in Damascus beat the previous
best of 13-0, set by New Zealand against Fiji in 1981.
</P>
<P>
Bakeri scored his first three in a five-minute spell in the
first half, followed by another six-minute hat-trick between the
62nd and 68th minutes before completing his tally five minutes
from time.
</P>
<P>
Currently no player had ever scored seven goals in a World Cup
match.
</P>
<P>
Iran's win marked the 14th time in World Cup history where one
team has scored at least 10 goals. Apart from Hungary's 10-1 win
over El Salvador in the 1982 finals in Spain, all were in the
qualifiers including four for next year's World Cup finals in
France.

<HEADLINE> Arafat to Visit Egypt Early Tomorrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat is due to arrive here tomorrow morning for talks
with President Hosni Mubarak on the deadlocked Mideast peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Ambassador to Egypt Zohdi al-Kodrah, breaking the
news to the Egyptian MENA news agency, said that the meeting, the
second in two weeks in continued consultations, aims at "serving
the Palestinian cause."
</P>
<P>
Kodrah hailed Egypt for its support to the Palestinian people's
legitimate right and demands, and extolled the efforts exerted by
Mubarak to break the current impasse in the peace march.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said the Palestinians support all Egyptian
drives to halt the Israeli settlement activities in the occupied
territories, including Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's trip came a week after Mubarak met with Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu in the Red Sea resort of Sharm
el-Sheikh in a bid to broke ice in the peace process which stalled
after Israel began building a new Jewish quarters in Arab East
Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who reportedly is floating an initiative to narrow the
difference between the Israelis and Palestinians, had hoped to
bring together Arafat and Netanyahu at a tripartite summit.
</P>
<P>
But Arafat's spokesman said such a meeting would be meaningless
when Israel continues its settlement construction in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
As part of intensified Egyptian mediation efforts, Mubarak's
political advisor Osama al-Baz left here this morning for a
four-day visit to the U.S., a co-sponsor of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He will brief the U.S. administration on his several shuttle
trips to the PA and Israel in the past few days in a bid to bring
the two sides back to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's office said the Egyptian efforts made "some
progress," but Palestinian sources said that Baz failed to get
Israeli response to the Palestinian demand.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have made their return to the negotiating
table conditional on a halt of Israel's expansionary policy.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's five-point plan aimed at persuading the two sides to
the table includes a temporary halt of settlement activities in
Jerusalem and the West Bank and the resumption of
Palestinian-Israeli security coordination.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has refused to stop the Har Homa construction and
instead proposed building a neighborhood for Arabs near the Jewish
housing project. He also proposed measures to ease the limitations
against the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Denies Meddling in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi
said here today Nigeria is trying to restore order in Sierra
Leone whose government was ousted in a military coup last month.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi said that his country had sent its forces to help Sierra
Leone in pursuit of the common goal of trying to bring peace and
stability to the west African region.
</P>
<P>
''This is not interference,'' he said, adding, ''We, as ECOWAS
(the Economic Community of West African States), have always been
interested in explosive situations that take place in our region
which we see as endangering civilians lives and disturb peace.''
</P>
<P>
He said, ''Together with the international community we must
not allow such a situation to continue.''
</P>
<P>
''Nigeria is going to ensure that peace, stability and a
legitimate government are restored in Sierra Leone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leonean President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah was ousted from
power by rebels led by Major Johnny Koromah on Africa Day.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity (OAU)
have condemned the coup and demanded that rebel leaders should
restore the ousted government.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi is representing Nigerian Head of State Sani AbachA to
attend the 33rd summit conference of the Organization of African
Unity in Harare.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Government Launches Spending Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government today agreed
on a program of spending cuts to keep expenditure in the fiscal
1998 national budget below this year's level as the first step
toward repairing the country's battered finances.
</P>
<P>
The government's general or policy-related expenditures in
fiscal 1998, which begins next April, will be trimmed by some 200
billion yen (1.7 billion U.S. dollars), or 0.5 percent, to 43.6
trillion yen (379 billion dollars) from the budgeted spending of
43.8 trillion yen (380.8 billion dollars) for fiscal 1997.
</P>
<P>
Increases in social security spending will be kept to some 300
billion yen (2.6 billion dollars) and spending on public works
will be cut by at least 7 percent or 630 billion yen (5.5 billion
dollars) over 1997.
</P>
<P>
The government also decided to cut Japan's annual defense
budget by 3 percent on a year-on-year basis between fiscal 1998
and 2000, excluding spending needed for the transfer and return of
the U.S. military bases in Okinawa Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Assistance for developing countries will be slashed by 10
percent, or 110 billion yen (0.96 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The spending cuts are aimed at reducing the government's
budget deficit which, at seven percent in the year to March 1997,
is the worst in the industrialized world. The government aims to
reduce the ratio to three percent by 2003.

HARARE, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
said here today that African countries has no alternative but to
integrate their small markets into a large single market in front of
the challenge of world-wide economic development.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba made the remarks while addressing the inaugural summit of
the African Economic Community at the Organization of African Unity
meeting. He is current Chairman of the Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said that Africa should organize its home market first if it
is to take advantage of the opening of trade opportunities offered
under the current Uruguay Round agreements and the World Trade
Organization rules.
</P>
<P>
"If we remain divided, small and relatively weak," Chiluba said,
"then we shall open ourselves to manipulation and marginalization as
manifested in adverse terms of trade, restricted trade and commodity
quarters, segregative standards, transfer pricing and many other such
prohibitive practices we continue to experience in global
transactions."
</P>
<P>
He stressed, "We need to approach the world
economy from the strong position of unity with a strong bargaining
position" to "confront the adversities of the open advanced global
economy."

<HEADLINE> Software Becoming America's No.3 Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The computer software business has
risen rapidly to become America's third-largest manufacturing
industry, according to a new study.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by Nathan Associates, an economic
consulting firm, found that the American software industry
generated revenues of 102.8 billion U.S. dollars last year. Since
1990, the software industry has grown at a rate of 12.5 percent
annually, nearly 2.5 times faster than the economy as a whole.
</P>
<P>
On the value-added basis, software ranked third after
automobiles and electronics. In a 1995 study, software ranked
fifth, behind the aircraft and pharmaceutical industry as well as
autos and electronics.
</P>
<P>
The study, which provides the most detailed portrait to date of
the jobs and wealth generated by the fast-growing software
industry, is intended to emphasize the rising importance of the
software industry, the New York Times said in a report today.
</P>
<P>
The industry-sponsored research will be presented to Washington
Wednesday by a group of computer executives led by Bill Gates of
Microsoft and Andrew Grove of Intel, two giants in U.S. computer
software business.
</P>
<P>
"We see the study as a framework for saying to leaders in
Washington that software is major engine of the modern economy,"
Robert Holleyman, president of the Business Software Alliance, was
quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Indian PM Appoints Four Women MPs as Ministers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar
Gujral today appointed four women MPs as cabinet ministers in a
move to give adequate representation to women in his government.
</P>
<P>
This is the first expansion of the Gujral cabinet since it was
installed on April 21. With the inclusion of the four women
members, the present Council of Ministers has raised its strength
to 44.
</P>
<P>
All the four new comers will be ministers of state in the
cabinet. President S.D. Sharma administered the oath of office to
the new ministers at a simple ceremony at the Rashtrapati Bhawan
(president building).
</P>
<P>
The forty-three-year-old Jayanthi Natarajan, an articulate
lawyer-turned-politician, hails from a traditionally Congress
party family and is the grand daughter of former Tamil Nadu chief
minister M. Bakthavatsalam.
</P>
<P>
Kamla Sinha is a veteran trade union leader from Bihar state
while Ratnamala Savanoor is a well-known social worker.
</P>
<P>
A fourth woman politician inducted into the central Government
today is Renuka Chaudhury, who is regarded as an extremely vocal
and aggressive member of the upper house of parliament. She has
been a member of parliament for over a decade.
</P>
<P>
The inclusion of more women members into the cabinet is in
keeping with Gujral's commitment to giving adequate representation
to women in his government.
</P>
<P>
The move is also seen as an attempt to placate women MPs who
have been resentful of the concerted bid to block passage of a
women bill to reserve one-third of seats in the parliament and
state assemblies for women. The United Front government tabled the
women bill before parliament last year, but it has so far failed
to be passed due to strong opposition from various parties and men
MPs.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Accuses Israel of Breaching Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Leader Yasser Arafat
said today that Israel was planning to offer only 40 percent of
the West Bank to Palestinians as part of a final peace
settlement.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who was here attending the Organization of African
Unity's 33rd summit to lobby support from African leaders against
Israel, told reporters that "This is not the first time the
Israelis are breaching the agreement signed at the white house
(in Washington)".
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has denied the
alleged plan.
</P>
<P>
The alleged plan would allow Israel to annex or maintain
control over at least 60 percent of the West Bank captured by
Israel along with the Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem in the 1967
Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians demand full control over all the occupied
territories for the creation of an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to the peace process, but the other side is
not," Arafat said. "Netanyahu has shown that he is against past
agreements."
</P>
<P>
Arafat said the construction of Jewish settlements in Arab
east Jerusalem, which began two months ago, was another
indication that Netanyahu was not committed to peace.
</P>
<P>
The OAU Council of Ministers recommended at the end of its
meeting last week in Harare that the African summit call on
Israel to stop the construction of the settlements.
</P>
<P>
"What was agreed upon at the ministerial level is very strong
and we, at the same time, are grateful for the continuous support
we get from the summit to our cause," Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
On reports that some of Palestinian officials had sold land to
Jews, Arafat said an investigation would be launched and culprits
be brought to court.
</P>
<P>
"There is a law and we are following that law agaisnt those
who sold the land," Arafat said.

PARIS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- France's new Socialist Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin has indicated that he will set up a "clean"
government whose members are not involved or suspected of being
involved in any corruption case.
</P>
<P>
Socialist officials also said that the new left government of
France will be pluralistic, including members from the Communist
Party, the radical Socialists, the Greens and other leftwing party
members.
</P>
<P>
The new cabinet will comprise 15 ministers and several state
secretaries, and women ministers are expected to play a big role
in it, said Socialist officials.
</P>
<P>
Jospin has already named Olivier Schrameck as the director of
his cabinet, and Jean-Pierre Jouyet assistant director of the
cabinet, while the list of ministers is expected to be published
Wednesday or Thursday, before Jospin leaves for Malmoe, Sweden, to
attend a Socialist summit of Europe.
</P>
<P>
No government officials will be allowed to hold a second post
or to be on a second payroll, and Jospin himself will resign from
the post as Socialist Party chief in November, said the officials.
</P>
<P>
Jospin today formally took over the prime minister's office
from Alain Juppe.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Laurent Kabila, President of the
Democratic Republic of Cogo (DRC), today vowed to alleviate
poverty and boost economic development in his country.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, who was here attending the 33rd summit of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), told reporters that he was
confident of meeting the challenges he was facing.
</P>
<P>
He said his country, with little external aid, would rely on
internal resources to carry out most of the development programs.
</P>
<P>
"External aid is important, but first we must count on our own
capabilities," said Kabila. "We have potentials in human
resources and wealth."
</P>
<P>
He said his country is beset by a series of difficulties like
rampant curruption, high jobless rate and poor agriculture that
were left over by the previous regime which he toppled last month
after a several-month rebelion.
</P>
<P>
Kabila said the best thing is that "we have liberated our
country," adding that even those who supported the former regime
are now backing the new government.
</P>
<P>
He said the two-year period before the proposed elections
would be used to ensure some basic infrastructure and build
support services to facilitate the transition.
</P>
<P>
"If everything goes according to plan, two years are enough
for us to prepare," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kabila, who was sworn in as President of the DRC last week,
has promised to hold elections in his country in two years.

by about 397 million U.S. dollars during the first 10 months of
the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB), earnings by
ready-made garments fell short of its target by 160 million
dollars, frozen foods by 95 million dollars, jute goods by 66
million dollars and leather by 75 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The four sectors normally account for 75 percent of the
country's total annual export earnings.
</P>
<P>
Exports of petroleum products, tea, handicrafts and electronic
goods also failed to reach their targets during the July-April
period of the 1996-97 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
However, some agricultural goods, chemical and engineering
products, knitwear and other "minor sectors" performed "better
than expected" and helped minimize the shortfall, said the EPB.
</P>
<P>
The target for the first 10 months of fiscal 1996-97 was 3.83
billion dollars and the earnings stood at 3.78 billion dollars,
leaving a shortfall of about 50 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The government has set the target of export earnings for fiscal
1996-97 as 4.599 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> AEC's Inaugural Session Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 3 (Xinhua) -- African leaders today held the
first inaugural session of the African Economic Community (AEC)
which is set to become a force in ridding the continent of
poverty and deprivation.
</P>
<P>
The session was convened on the sideline of the 33rd summit of
the Organization of African Unity (OAU). The summit entrusted
OAU's Council of Ministers to be the highest organ surpervising
the AEC.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, who assumed the
chaimanship of the 53-member OAU on monday, said the
establishment of the highest organ of the AEC constituted a
standard by which Africa's future economic policies would be
judged by Africans and outsiders.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said the event, witnessed by 28 heads of state and
government and three prime ministers, crowned efforts stretching
several decades made by the OAU, resulting in several resolutions
and declarations which laid a firm political foundation for the
establishment of AEC.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe noted that the pillars of the AEC were the African
regional integration bodies specified in the Abuja Treaty adopted
in 1991, which came into force in 1994.
</P>
<P>
What African countries now need to do, said Mugabe, was to
integrate their markets and transform their economies currently
characterised by low levels of industrialization, high dependence
on international trade, extremely low levels of intra-African
trade and small markets.
</P>
<P>
He said the AEC should make it possible for African countries
to produce competitive products that would enjoy preferential
treatment in African markets.
</P>
<P>
African countries, he said, faced a hostile external economic
environment induced by forces outside its control.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, African countries were exporters of raw
materials and minerals whose prices they did not control.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, the value of exports had been declining and
yet the cost of importing manufactured products had been on the
increase, Mugabe added.
</P>
<P>
He criticised the world trade organization and international
financial institutions for taking hostile policies towards Africa
and the entire developing world.
</P>
<P>
"It would appear that there is a coordinated political agenda
by the north, which controls these institutions, aimed at
suppressing the development of developing countries," said
Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
He called on African countries to strengthen solidarity with
other affected developing countries in creating a just and
equitable international economic order.
</P>
<P>
"Together we must resist the recololization of our countries
under a facade of programs to safeguard the global environment or
globalization," Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
He said the inaugural session of the AEC had sent a strong
signal that it was now empowering itself to defeat the
indignities of poverty, hunger and disease through joint actions
in social, economic and political fields.

<HEADLINE> SADC Pledges Support for AEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The 12-member Southern African
Development Community (SADC) today pledged full support for the
African Economic Community (AEC) which held its inaugural meeting in
Harare today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting held on the second day of the 33rd summit
of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), Mozambican President
Joachim Chissano said, ''SADC has committed itself to cooperating with
other regional economic organisations to accelerate the establishment
of the African Economic Community."
</P>
<P>
He said, ''We believe that consolidation of regional integration
process will enhance our capacity towards gradual establishment of
African Economic Community.'' he, however, felt the full impact of
African economic cooperation would be gradual.
</P>
<P>
An agreement made at a SADC Council of Ministers meeting in
February this year to sign the protocol of relations between the AEC
and the regional economic communities would provide a sound framework
for practical cooperation and dialogue, Chissano said.
</P>
<P>
''I would like to underline the importance of strengthening the
existing regional economic communities and establishing new ones
where they do not exist in order to facilitate the process of
establishment of the AEC,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He added the AEC would provide deeper cooperation and integration
of African economies which would help avoid marginalisation in the
face of growing globalisation of trade.

<HEADLINE> London Futures Exchange Trades Record May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The London International Financial
Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE) traded a record of 16,597,319
contracts in May, 33 percent up on May 1996.
</P>
<P>
Average daily volume amounted to 829,866 futures and options
contracts, representing a daily nominal turnover of 163 billion
pounds (266 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Statistics released today show that since the beginning of this
year, the LIFFE's cumulative volume has totaled 83,946,904 futures
and options contracts, a rise of 19 percent over the same period
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The historic link between the LIFFE and the Chicago Board of
Trade (CBOT), whereby the LIFFE trades the CBOT's 30 Year Treasury
(T-Bond) futures and options contracts and the CBOT trades the
LIFFE's 10 Year German Government Bond futures and options
contracts, was inaugurated on May 9.
</P>
<P>
To date, a total of 26,873 T-Bond futures and options contracts
have been traded at the LIFFE and a total of 115,479 futures and
options contracts have been traded at the CBOT.
</P>
<P>
Jack Wigglesworth, chairman of the LIFFE, said, "We are
extremely pleased with the success of the link so far. When the
Bundesbank made its announcement on May 28, the CBOT traded a
record number of LIFFE Bond contracts on its floor. The LIFFE's
alliance with the CBOT is providing opportunities for both
exchanges, now and in the future, and we look forward to watching
the progress of both contracts."
</P>
<P>
Factors such as the British elections, continuing speculation
over Italian entry to Economic and Monetary Union and a
speculation over a possible rise in U.S. interest rates have
contributed to record volume for the month of May, according to
the chairman.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The LIFFE's position as the largest futures and
options exchange outside Chicago is thus maintained, providing an
efficient, well-regulated environment for the management of
international interest rate and Britain's stock market risk."

<P>
HARARE, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni here
today urged African countries to improve their production capacities
in the interest of national economic development.
</P>
<P>
While addressing the summit conference of the African Economic
Community at the Organization of African Unity meeting, Museveni
said that continental common market will be still-born and never see
the light of day unless African states improve their production
capacities, widen their tax bases and evolve a harmonious working
partnership with business people.
</P>
<P>
he said that it is all very well to talk about achieving African
economic integration, but this will remain a pipedream unless African
countries develop their human resources.
</P>
<P>
Museveni pointed out, "We must ensure that every African has been
to school, not only just to read and write English, or French or
Arabic as if that is education. The people must learn skills that
can feed them."

<HEADLINE> Mobutu's Assets Worth 3.5 Mln Dlrs Found in Switzerland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss Banking Commission
announced today that former Zairian leader Mobutu Sese Seko's
assets found in six Swiss banks are only less than 5 million Swiss
francs (about 3.5 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The assets including foreign shares, bonds, securities and a
safe deposit box have been frozen. The sum of 4,786,570 Swiss
francs (about 3.5 million U.S. dollars) is far below the figure of
7.7 billion U.S. dollars which new Zairian authorities led by
Laurent Kabila claimed that Mobutu and his family members had
transferred to Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
On May 17, the Swiss Federal Council (federal government)
ordered to freeze all of Mobutu's assets in Switzerland. The Swiss
government announced that the decision to freeze the assets of
Mobutu and his family members entered into force immediately as
Mobutu no long exercised the function of a Zairian president.
</P>
<P>
Also on that day, the Swiss government ordered all
organizations administering Mobutu's assets in Switzerland to
report at once to the federal finance department.
</P>
<P>
On May 16, the Swiss federal government decided to freeze
Mobutu's 5.5-million-dollar villa in Savigny, Vaud, about 60
kilometers northeast of Geneva.

WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States today began a
new phase of evacuation of Americans and other foreigners from
troubled Sierra Leone following reports of violence resulting from
a military coup.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Marines using helicopters evacuated another 1,217
foreigners, including about 20 Americans, from the capital of
Freetown, the Defense Department said. That brought to nearly
2,500 the total number of persons, including some 430 Americans,
removed since last Friday.
</P>
<P>
"There have been no casualties. It has been a well-run
operation. They are all out," Defense Secretary William Cohen told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
U.S. evacuees in last Friday's operation were taken from
Freetown's Manny Yoko Hotel to the nearby warship, the USS
Kearsarge, via U.S. helicopters.
</P>
<P>
But today's rescue operation began at a new site because of
reports of violence at the hotel.

LONDON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Britain said today it would not
allow a visit by a delegation from the Iraqi Oil Ministry.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Foreign Office said Britain had turned
down visa applications from five Iraqi officials who planned to
hold talks on selling oil for food and medicines as part of a deal
approved by the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"It is quite legitimate for British companies holding licenses
to deal with Iraq to speak to Iraqi businessman. But British
policy is to reject applications from Iraqi officials," he said.
</P>
<P>
The current oil-for-food deal calls for 2 billion U.S. dollars
worth of oil sales over six months so that Iraq can buy food and
medicine for its people, who are suffering from U.N. trade
sanctions imposed in August 1990 when Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The African leaders attending the 33rd
summit of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) today adopted a
United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) sponsored
industrial plan for Africa.
</P>
<P>
The plan, dubbed the Alliance for Africa's Industrialisation
(AAI), seeks to promote integrated industrialisation in Africa
through sharing of information, resources and expertise.
</P>
<P>
The modalities of how to achieve that would soon be worked out by
a patron group of five heads of state led by Cote d'Ivoire's Konan
Bedie.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference soon after the adoption of the plan,
Ivorian Industry Minister Theophile Ahoua N'doli said, ''The goals of
the AAI include institutional capacity building, linking industry and
agriculture to enhance productivity and agro-industry sector
competitiveness, promoting growth of small and medium scale
industries and promoting private investment and technology
transfor.''
</P>
<P>
N'doli added the heads of state and government recognised that
without sustainable industrial development, african economies would be
condemned to persistent economic crises.
</P>
<P>
the leaders requested that UNIDO, in cooperation with the AEC and
the OAU secretariat, to organise a donor conference that would start
off the program by next year.

<HEADLINE> Four Militants Killed in Southern Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Security forces gunned down four
Muslim militants in southern Egypt in a fierce clash Monday night,
Interior Minister Hassan el-Alfi said today.
</P>
<P>
The fire exchange occurred in Samalut, Minya, 200 kilometers
southwest of Cairo, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The killed, all in their twenties, were identified as members
of the Al Gamaa Al Islamiya, or the Islamic Group that has been
blamed for a spate of recent assassinations in the south.
</P>
<P>
The four men were involved in the killing of nine Coptic
Christians during an attack on a nearby church on February 13,
el-Alfi said.
</P>
<P>
Two of the four rifles found Monday night at the scene belonged
to two police recruits who were killed in a terrorist attack in
Minya in 1995, the Egyptian MENA news agency quoted an Interior
official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government has tightened the noose around the Islamic
militants who have been fighting to set up an Islamic rule since
1992.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,050 people have been killed in the violence and
most of them were police and militants.

<HEADLINE> Botswana Plans Industrial Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Botswanan government is
mapping out a framework for the privatization of some government
enterprises in a bid to speed up development of national economy,
said reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Although policy is still being formulated, the government has
already indicated that the partial privatization is likely to
affect state-owned departments, such as Botswana
Telecommunications Corporation, Air Botswana and the Botswana
Livestock Development Corporation, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Botswana Confederation of Commerce, Industry and Manpower
has urged the governemnt to privatize enterprises such as
Botswana Railways, Botswana Meat Commission, the Central Tender
Board and Botswana Housing Corportation.
</P>
<P>
The confederation has been engaged in campaign for
privatization of state-owned enterprises, hoping it will enable
them to compete in southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
"We have to learn to do business with little protection and to
compete with other business. This is crucial since the world is
moving towards open markets," Botswanan policy co-ordinator
Ditshaba Molobe said.
</P>
<P>
However, Botswana's move to privatization has also been met
with caution in other quarters amid warnings that the transfer of
government assets should be handled delicately.
</P>
<P>
"Traditionally, govenrments have been privatizing sectors
which are seen to be inefficient, but that does not guarantee
success," said Sennye Obuseng, Economics Lecturer of
Botswana University.
</P>
<P>
Obuseng pointed out the big problem in Botswana is that few
people with capital or sufficient
expertise can run enterprises simlilar to the one run by the
government.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not very optimistic that the government will get buyers
who can provide what the government cannot provide now," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some parties in Botswana also criticize that
privatization will simply mean giving away national assets to
foreign companies because locals cannot affort to buy them.

<HEADLINE> Air Embargo Worsens Iraqis' Health Status: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. air embargo and delayed
delivery of medicine and medical supplies have seriously worsened
the health status of the Iraqi people, a local English-language
newspaper reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The Baghdad Observer quoted a recent survey conducted by the
Iraqi Health Ministry as saying that the air embargo, which was
imposed on Iraq by the U.N. Security Council after the country
invaded Kuwait in August, 1990, has caused the death of 1,918
Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
The survey blamed this situation on the air embargo as well
as the lack of medicine and medical facilities, such as
ambulances in particular, which have made it almost impossible
to transfer swiftly Iraqi patients from one place to another or
to facilitate their necessary treatment abroad.
</P>
<P>
The problem in Iraq is not that doctors are unable to treat
the patients, rather they do not have medicines and other
essential medical supplies, said the paper, stressing that many
of the patients would have been treated locally if necessary
medical supplies had been available.
</P>
<P>
However, up till now only 60 tonnes of medicines have arrived
in Iraq, a country with a total population of 20 million.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Health Minister Omed Medhat Mubarak said recently at a
news conference that the sufferings of Iraqis are even greater
now than seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
Before the U.N. sanctions were imposed in 1990, the mortality
rate for Iraqi children under age five averaged 540 a month, but
"it has now reached 5,600 and is still growing," according to the
minister.
</P>
<P>
Iraq was allowed to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil
to buy food, medicine and other necessities in accordance with
an "oil-for-food" deal with the U.N.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has asked the U.N. for permission to fly Iraqi patients
abroad for medical treatment, but has received no answer yet.

<P>
NAIROBI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- China will help Kenya to start
Chinese-language teaching and studying, according to an
accord on bilateral educational cooperation signed by
the two governments here today.
</P>
<P>
The accord was signed by Kenyan Education Minister J. Kamotho
and Wei Yu, the visiting Vice-Minister of China's State Education
Commission, after their talks.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, China will dispatch a teacher to the Egerton
University in southwestern Kenya, to teach Chinese and donate
necessary textbooks.
</P>
<P>
China will also provide laboratory equipment, reagents and
books to help the Egerton University advance horticultural
teaching and research.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Livestock Holders Association to Be Formed in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 3 (Xinhua) --Tanzanian Minister for Agriculture and
Co-operatives Paul Kimiti, today urged livestock holders to set
up a mechanism that will facilitate the development of the livestock
sector in the country.
</P>
<P>
Opening a meeting on the promotion of the Stakeholders Association
formation, Kimiti said the contribution of the livestock sector, which
makes some 18 percent of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP),
was still very low compared to the large livestock and vast rangeland
resources.
</P>
<P>
He said, according to 1994/95 national sample census of
agriculture, Tanzania had 15.6 million cattle, 10.6 million goats, 3.5
million sheep and some 27 million chickens.
</P>
<P>
The government had been facing problems in the
choice of policies to suit both suppliers and consumers so as to meet
the consumer demand for livestock products, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kimiti said such a mechanism, would therefore, facilitate a
dialogue between the government and the private sector hence adoption
of policies that would suit the interests of both the supplier and the
consumer.
</P>
<P>
He said the government was also intending to facilitate the
formation of other livestock stakeholders like dairy farmers, meat
processors, livestock input suppliers, dairy processors and animal
feeds manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, attended by livestock holders,
officials from the ministry and academiciians, a 10-man task force was
formed that would recommend on the structure of the proposed livestock
holders association within two months.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Labour and Social
Affairs of Ethiopia has carried out a survey on agricultural wage
employment and rural non-farm employment.
</P>
<P>
The survey is presented for discussion and endorsement by a team
of experts at a seminar which is opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted with the financial and technical
assistance from the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and
the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), is
aimed to help formulating agriculture-led industrial development
policy in the country.
</P>
<P>
Opening the seminar, Minister of Labour and Social Affairs
Hassen Abdela said poverty in rural areas has its roots mainly
in low productivity, sub-economic holdings and landlessness.
</P>
<P>
He added that small and fragmented farm-sized and low level
technology have reduced the capacity of farmers to undertake long-
term investment on the farm.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 90 percent of Ethiopia's population live in rural areas
and 85 percent of its labour force is engaged in rural activities
to earn its living. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 3 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary General Kofi Annan
today called for a peaceful solution to the crisis in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Annan told a press conference that African countries and the
international community should do whatever they could to get the coup
leaders in Sierra Leone step down and restore the legitimate and
elected government.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who was here attending the 33rd summit of african
countries, expressed the hope that this could be achieved without
military force.
</P>
<P>
"There is the possibility that further bloodshed can be avoided in
Sierra Leone," Annan said when asked whether outside military
intervention would be applied to reverse the coup.
</P>
<P>
Military officers in Sierra Leone toppled the civil government
in a coup in late May, drawing worldwide condemnation. Nigerian
forces bombarded Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone in the past
few days in a bid to force the coup leaders to surrender.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he did not want the parties concerned to resort to
military means to settle the crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said there would have been more bloodshed if the issue had
not been handled properly.
</P>
<P>
He called on the coup leaders to "listen to reason", saying:
"It is extremely difficult to govern a nation if your neighbors do
not accept you, the region does not accept you, the world does not
accept you and the people do not accept you."
</P>
<P>
"So I hope bloodshed can be avoided," he added.
</P>
<P>
But he indicated that if military intervention became the last
resort of option, he and African leaders would prepare to go that
way. enditem

<HEADLINE> Iraq's Oil-for-Food Plan Shows Mixed Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Implementation of the
oil-for-food plan to alleviate Iraq's humanitarian crises
presented mixed results: the value of the oil export contracts
approved nearly fulfilled the revenue objective while a large
number of import applications had been placed on hold, according
to a UN report.
</P>
<P>
The report prepared by the UN's Iraqi sanction committee said
that as at May 30, a total of 51 contracts had been submitted for
review by the UN overseers and all of them have been approved. The
oil export contracts approved, under which 121 million barrels
would be shipped overseas, were estimated at 2.16 billion dollars.
After deducting the pipeline fees, the value was similar to the
180-day revenue objective of 2 billion dollars as stipulated in
Security Council resolution 986.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food plan stipulated by the resolution was aimed at
alleviating the severe shortage of food and medicine caused by the
six-year-long economic sanctions. The UN has imposed strict
sanctions, including embargo of oil export, on Iraq after its
invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
However, import of food, medicine and other humanitarian goods
lagged far behind as the initial 180-day period for
implementation of resolution 986 would come to an end on June 7.
</P>
<P>
The UN secretariat had received 630 import applications from
Iraq as at May 30. Among the 574 of the import applications
circulated to the Iraqi sanction committee members, only 331 were
approved with a total value of 816 million dollars while 191 were
placed on hold, 14 blocked and 38 awaiting decisions of the
Committee.
</P>
<P>
On delayed action of import approval, the sanction committee,
or officially knowns as the Security Council Committee established
by resolution 661 (1990) concerning the situation between Iraq and
Kuwait, noted the process for approval of Iraq's import
applications had been one of the most complex tasks facing the
committee and the UN secretariat.
</P>
<P>
"The committee is concerned at the slow pace of contract
approval, which has been caused by a number of factors, including
the initial insufficiency of funds in the United Nations Iraq
account and deficiencies in submitted applications," the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Committee members who placed holds on contracts indicated that
a major reason was that the applications were incomplete or
technically inconsistent with the approved distribution plan, the
report added.
</P>
<P>
But, the Iraqi government accused the United States of
hindering the implementation of the oil-for-food plan. "The delay
in the implementation of this humanitarian aspect of Resolution
986 is due to an insistence from the United States delegation in
the (661) committee to place a hold or block most contracts to
procure the above mentioned goods," said a recent press release of
the Iraqi mission to the UN.
</P>
<P>
"Currently, the US delegation blocks or places on hold 220
contracts out of 610 contracts circulated for approval," the Iraqi
press release said.
</P>
<P>
"This attitude is inevitably leading to the prolongation of
suffering experienced daily by the Iraqi people.... 25 percent of
Iraqi children are suffering from severe chronic malnutrition,"
the release added.

<HEADLINE> Angola to Implement Rural Trade Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Angola will carry out a long term
trade program in its rural areas to promote their development,
Minister of Agriculture Carlos Fernandes said here today.
</P>
<P>
He announced the Angolan government's decision at a news
conference held here today.

Therefore, the government has decided to implement the long
term agricultural trade program to improve trade in rural areas,
he added.

The program's main focuses include rebuilding trade networks
in rural areas and promoting development of rural markets, he
revealed, adding that the government will allocate five million

<HEADLINE> Tension Escalates Along Sudanese-Eritrean Borders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Tension escalated along the
Sudanese-Eritrean border today as the Sudanese government accused
Eritrea of preparing for attacks against its towns and garrisons
along the border.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese press reports today said Eritrean troops have been
mobilised all along the borders with the Sudan, and are armed with
modern equipment including armored vehicles and rockets.
</P>
<P>
The reports said that Eritrean troops are ready to launch an
attack to occupy the main road linking the capital of Khartoum
with the principal northern Red Sea port of Port Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The reports added the projected goal of an Eritrean offensive
is to occupy the towns of Kasala and Port Sudan and to enable the
Sudanese opposition to move into the depth of the Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The Sudan has been repeatedly accusing Eritrean troops of
taking part in the fighting which has once and again erupted along
the joint borders for more than six months and has lodged a
complaint against Eritrea with the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
But the accusations were flatly denied by Eritrea, which
claimed the fighting was fought between the Sudanese government
troops and the Sudanese opposition forces.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said Eritrea occupied the garrisons of Atirba
and Qaroura in east Sudan last March. The Sudan then announced
its forces killed a large number of Eritrean troops during an
offensive.
</P>
<P>
The Sudan has recently closed its borders with Eritrea and is
strengthening measures against the smuggling of goods and cars,
which it alleged was carried out by Eritrea in favor of the
Sudanese opposition.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that with the intensified exchange of
accusations between the two countries, and the mobilization of
troops along the joint borders have made room for the Sudanese
opposition forces lead by John Garang to step up actions.
</P>
<P>
Border tension will also divert the Sudanese government forces
from southern Sudan to the northeast part in order to ensure the
security of Port Sudan, a fact which will actually assist the
opposition to penetrate into the depth of the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) today signed two agreements in Nairobi to
support Kenyan financial sector projects.
</P>
<P>
Under an investment agreement with Credit Finance Corporation
(CFC) Bank Limited of Kenya, a loan option facility of 10 million
U.S. dollars is established. The hedge facility, a new product
introduced by the IFC, will allow the CFC Bank the right, but not
the obligation, to draw down short- and medium-term loans from the
IFC.
</P>
<P>
CFC Limited was established as the first independent
asset-based financing company in Kenya in 1955 and was listed on
the Nairobi Stock Exchange in 1970. In 1995, it converted into a
commercial bank, CFC Bank Limited, offering a wide range of
products and services.
</P>
<P>
The IFC also signed a financing agreement for a 1 million
dollar equity investment to transform Kenya Rural Enterprise
Program into a commercial, micro-enterprise bank known as K-Rep
Bank. This is the IFC's first direct investment in a
micro-enterprise financial institution.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the IFC, the other major shareholders of K-Rep Bank
will include South Shore Bank of Chicago, the African Development
Bank, Triodios, a Dutch non-governmental organization and the
Netherlands Development Organization.
</P>
<P>
Up to date, the IFC has invested over 70 million dollars for 24
projects in Kenya of eastern Africa.
</P>
<P>
The IFC is a member of the World Bank Group and the largest
multilateral source of equity and loan financing for private
sector projects in developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Saudi FM in Jordan on Peace Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister
Prince Saud al-Faisal arrived here today in an effort to salvage
the deadlocked peace process.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein of Jordan met with the Saudi foreign minister this
evening at the Royal Court and both sides discussed the peace
development in the region and issues of bilateral ties, Jordan
Television reported.
</P>
<P>
But details of the meeting were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
On his arrival in the kingdom, the Saudi foreign minister told
the press that Saudi Arabia is making an effort to activate the
peace process since no breakthrough was made by the international
efforts to bring the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks back on
track.
</P>
<P>
The hardline policy of the Israeli government has plunged the
peace march into a dead corner, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Mideast peace process has been stalled again for about
three months since Israel started building new Jewish settlement
in Har Homa in Arab East Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
Saudi-Jordanian relations cooled down during the 1990-1991
Gulf crisis (1990-1991) because Jordan sided with Iraq when it
invaded Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral ties between Jordan and Saudi Arabia was warming
up after Jordan distanced itself from Iraq in a bid to end its
isolation from other Arab states and the West since the end of
the Gulf crisis.

<HEADLINE> World Trading Structures Changing Rapidly, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The world economy is no longer based
on traditional trading structures and wealth is generated in
entirely different ways and information technology is central, a
conference was told here today.
</P>
<P>
The conference, Exploiting The Information Age, is designed to
inform UK business leaders on how the convergence of computers and
communications technologies will radically reshape the way
companies work in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales on the Internet in 1995 were valued at 312 million
pounds (499 million US dollars). By the end of the decade they are
predicted to rise to 3.7 billion pounds (5.9 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
It is forecasted by the year 2005 that 30 percent of Britain's
21 billion pounds (33.6 billion US dollars) retail sales will be
executed electronically.
</P>
<P>
As part of its ongoing drive to make the Information Age not
only accessible, but useful, to business and industry,
Hewlett-Packard (HP), a leading global provider of computing,
Internet and Intranet solutions joined forces with the
Confederation of British Industry.
</P>
<P>
Together, the two organizations are staging a series of events
to stimulate debate and help companies attain their commercial
objectives and stay ahead of competition through the efficient use
of the latest technology.
</P>
<P>
HP's chief executive, John Golding said: "We are in the midst
of a revolution - telecommunications and computing technologies
have merged and will radically alter the way we do business."
</P>
<P>
An observer from the City said, small companies with big ideas
can look to the world's finance markets for investment and venture
capital. Without today's advanced computer systems and
telecommunications networks, this would be impossible.
</P>
<P>
An information expert at the conference said:"Innovative use of
information technology is the key to gaining a competitive edge in
the emerging global market of the Information Age."
</P>
<P>
"Companies must change the way that they structure themselves
and the way that employees work together," he added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: UK's MPC Leading Members Named </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Chancellor Gordon Brown
put an end to speculation on Monday by announcing the four leading
members of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC).
</P>
<P>
The announcement was greeted with relief in the City.
Economists said the new members added credibility to the
committee, which has responsibility for fixing interest rate
policy under Chancellor's reform plans.
</P>
<P>
The appointees are Dr DeAnne Julius, chief economist at British
Airways, Sir Alan Budd, chief economic adviser at the Treasury,
and two academics, Professor Charles Goodhart and Professor Willem
Buiter.
</P>
<P>
The creation of the new committee, which meets for the first
time on Thursday and Friday, marks an important stage in the
Transfer from the Treasury to the Bank of control over interest
rates, the Chanceller announced a month ago.
</P>
<P>
The MPC appointments, which were seen as non-political and
likely to have a neutral impact on policy, were welcomed by City
economists.
</P>
<P>
Adam Cole, UK economist at HSBC James Capel, said: "The
appointments are all fairly middle of the road and there is no one
whom I would regard as especially a hawk or a dove on inflation."
</P>
<P>
Eddie Georte, the Governor of the Bank of England, said he was
"delighted" with the new members and felt certain they would make
a major contribution to the Bank.
</P>
<P>
However, City economists were divided on whether a
quarter-point rise in interest rates would be announced on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Cates, an economist at UBS, said he expected the first
meeting to result in rates being left alone for the time being.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Economic Growth Reaches Five-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Australia's annual economic growth
has slowed down to 2.4 percent for the 1996-97 fiscal year despite
an improved performance in the first three months of 1997, the
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said in a report released
today.
</P>
<P>
The growth was found to be 3.2 percent in a previous survey
conducted by the ABS.
</P>
<P>
The national economy grew by 0.9 percent in the first quarter
of this year over the previous quarter due to higher levels of
consumer demand, exports and investment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, net foreign debt rose by 0.4 percent in the year to
March 31, reaching 199.9 billion Australian dollars (152 billion
U.S. dollars), up 705 million Australian dollars (535.8 million
U.S. dollars) from the revised estimate for the previous three
months, according to the ABS.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard told the parliament today that
"growth in 1997-98 is expected to be consistent with the budget
estimate while growth in 1996-97 is likely to be 3 percent,"
putting him at odds with Treasurer Peter Costello who told
reporters he was confident of recording a higher growth rate.

order in the country which plunged into chaos in February after
armed rebels took to the streets.
</P>
<P>
Other countries in the Italian-led eight-nation MPF may also be
invited to bolster their contingents, but Italy will go ahead with
its reinforcements regardless, diplomatic sources said.
</P>
<P>
"After the elections, which we want to be free, fair and
honest, the military presence will be swiftly wound up," Dini said.
</P>
<P>
He said he and Defense Minister Beniamino Andreatta were making
arrangements for the short-term reinforcement to ensure security
at all polling stations in Albania.
</P>
<P>
Dini also said that a civil assistance program, including the
reconstruction of the police force and justice and administrative
systems in Albania, would be moved into high gear after the
elections.
</P>
<P>
"The whole international community is focused on this,
otherwise, Albania's instability risks destabilizing the
whole Balkan region even more," Dini said.
</P>
<P>
Albania's elections are seen as a key step to end months of
violence in the country, which was triggered by the collapse of
popular pyramid savings schemes last December.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Italy's annual inflation dropped to
1.6 percent in May, the lowest in 28 years, the national
statistics bureau ISTAT said today.
</P>
<P>
Inflation in April on an annualized basis was 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
But prices rose by 0.3 percent between April and May, the
highest increase since last November.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate would have been still lower had it not
been for a rise in postal rates, ISTAT said.
</P>
<P>
Inflation has been falling for several months in a row due to a
series of austerity measures taken by the Italian government in a
bid to qualify for the single European currency to be launched on
January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
ISTAT said the biggest price rises over the last 12 months were
in housing and related expenses, 4.0 percent, and in education,
3.5 percent.

Afghanistan, has also offered to host an international peace
conference in its Mazar-e-Sharif base to help end the war in the
country.

BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The 57th meeting of the Executive
Committee China's State Council, presided over by Premier Li Peng,
was held today and adopted in principle drafts of the Higher
Education Law and Flood-Control Law, and Public Security
Department Supervision Regulations.
</P>
<P>
Those present praised the progress the country's higher
education has made since the founding of the People's Republic,
and especially since the reforms and opening up started in the
late '70s, but said that a special law on higher education is
still necessary.
</P>
<P>
They pointed to the importance of a flood-control law because
of the frequent occurrence of flooding. Rapid growth in the
economy, the population, and the size of urban areas has caused
many new problems, and a law would help legalize flood-control
efforts.
</P>
<P>
It was decided that the two draft laws will be revised and
submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress for examination.
</P>
<P>
A special task force to oversee the police force to make it
cleaner and fairer is also necessary, it was pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The regulations will be promulgated by the State Council after
revisions.

<HEADLINE> China's Palace Museum Buys Precious Letters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Palace Museum in Beijing paid
8.52 million yuan for five letters from the Northern Song Dynasty
(960-1127) and a calligraphic work from the Yuan Dynasty
(1271-1368) at the Hanhai spring auction last weekend.
</P>
<P>
The letters include the only copy of handwriting of Shi Jie, a
Northern Song minister famous for his upright and outspoken ways,
and the calligraphy is the work in existance of Yang Zun, a famous
Yuan Dynasty calligrapher.
</P>
<P>
The works were referred to as national treasures by Xu Bangda,
an expert on Chinese painting and calligraphy who is a research
fellow at the Palace Museum. He says that there are only a few
remaining calligraphic works from the Northern Song Dynasty,
especially those recording social life and people's thoughts at
that time.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the museum spent 18 million yuan on a Chinese
painting, "Shi Yong Tu", from the Northern Song Dynasty at the
Hanhai autumn auction, and a lot of money at the Guardian autumn
auction for a painting by Shi Tao, a famous artist of the early
Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).
</P>
<P>
Last year, it bought a Chinese painting by Shen Zhou, a famous
artist of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), at the Hanhai spring
auction.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Mubarak Hold Talks in Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak held
talks with visiting Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President
Yasser Arafat at the presidential headquarters today in a bid to
propel the deadlocked Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
It was the second meeting between the two Arab leaders in two
weeks for continued consultations on the peace drive that stalled
in March when Israel began to build a new Jewish settlement in
disputed Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders reviewed the outcome of Mubarak's political
adviser Osama al-Baz's shuttle visits in the past few days to the
Israeli capital of Tel Aviv and Gaza to break ice in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed the result of the talks between Mubarak and
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu in the Red Sea resort of
Sharm el-Sheikh last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"All parties in the Middle East will face a dramatic situation
if the peace drive collapsed," he warned during his stopover in
Nairobi of Kenya en route to Cairo from Harare, Zimbabwe, where he
attended the summit of the Organization of the African Unity.
</P>
<P>
The PNA leader said the settlement practices were illegal and
ran counter to the Washington Agreement which stipulated no
demographic or geographical changes be made during the
transitional period to any of the settlements including those in
East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also rejected Israeli charges of his government's
involvement in the execution of three Palestinian land dealers.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have made their return to the negotiating
table conditional on a halt of Israel's expansionary policy.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu refused to stop the new construction and
instead proposed building a neighborhood for Arabs near the
Jewish housing project.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, speaking in parliament Tuesday, voiced
conviction that negotiations with Palestinians could be resumed in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
But he is less sure about the Syrian track, saying that Israel
did not receive a response to the proposal to resume negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who reportedly is floating a five-point initiative to
narrow the Palestinian-Israeli difference, had hoped to bring
together Arafat and Netanyahu at a tripartite summit.
</P>
<P>
As part of intensified Egyptian mediation efforts, Baz left
here Tuesday for a four-day visit to Washington to brief the
U.S. administration on his several shuttle trips to the PNA and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's office said the Egyptian efforts made "some
progress," but Palestinian sources said that Baz failed to get
the Israeli response to Palestinian demands.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said that after the talks, Arafat joined the
plenary session of talks between Mubarak and visiting Saudi Crown
Prince, Deputy Premier and head of the National Guards, Abdallah
Ben Abdel-Aziz.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei
vowed here today that Iran will never give in to enemies even
for an hour though the late spiritual leader Ruhollah Mousavi
Khomeini passed away for eight years.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a big gathering at Khomeini's Mausoleum in
southern Tehran, Khamenei said that "the Iranian people will work
hard toward perfection, prosperity, knowledge and sciences."
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Khamenei touched upon the sensitive issue of
the youth. He criticized the Shah's regime for ignoring the
fate of youth and completely ignoring people's will.
</P>
<P>
He said that the massive turn-out in the 7th presidential
election on May 23 was the result of following advise by the late
spiritual leader Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
Today is the 8th anniversary of the demise of Khomeini, the
father of the Islamic revolution and the founder of the Islamic
Republic of Iran.
</P>
<P>
Black-clad mourners have converged from various parts of Iran
as well as from several other countries to pay homage to the
memory of Khomeini, who lit the first sparks of the Islamic
revolution in June 5, 1963 and was forced into exile by the
monarchy, then returned to Iran in 1979 to establish the Islamic
republic.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the mausoleum were outgoing President Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani, President-elect Seyyed Mohammad Khatami,
Interior Minister Ali Mohammad Besharati and several other senior
officials as well as some ambassadors.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said that the Islamic system itself is chosen by the
people and the people consider the Islamic system as their
own. However, he warned that "backwardness and passivity are
threats to the Islamic revolution."

Kong, said at a press conference that the external environment is
favorable to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said that "stable interest rates, faster economic growth of
out trading partners and relatively stable exchange rates point to
faster economic growth in Hong Kong in 1997 and a similar rate of
growth in 1998."
</P>
<P>
He expected that inflation would fall slightly while retail
sales are expected to continue to improve noticeably in 1997,
helped by improved confidence and a surge in tourists.
</P>
<P>
On the economic relations between Hong Kong and the Chinese
mainland, he said that as the Chinese mainland becomes more
attractive as a destination of foreign direct investment, Hong
Kong will stand to benefit.
</P>
<P>
Greater inter-flows of capital and labor, as well as goods and
services suggest continuing economic integration between the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region and the mainland, he said.
</P>
<P>
The PEO, one of the projects of the Pacific Economic
Cooperation Council, is an annual forecast of 22 Pacific Rim
economies including Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Australian Shares Mark Time as Blue Chips Shine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Australian shares marked time
today as a lower gold price and end of financial year
book-squaring limited the market's gains.
</P>
<P>
The All Ordinaries index ended just 2.3 points higher at 2615.9
while in New York overnight the Dow Jones industrial average rose
22.75 points.
</P>
<P>
Select buying of key blue chips Coca-Cola Amatil, Commonwealth
Bank of Australia, BHP and Lend Lease Corp bolstered the market.
</P>
<P>
"It was a mixed day with the focus really on those few blue
chips," a Sydney-based trader said.
</P>
<P>
"It was a fairly reasonable market, but we're entering that
period where the institutions step back for a bit of end of
financial year book-squaring," he added.
</P>
<P>
Coca-Cola Amatil surged 4.55 percent or 70 cents while
Commonwealth Bank shares finished 31 cents up and BHP 10 cents.
</P>
<P>
The All Industrials index ended just 2.4 points firmer at
4080.8 and the All Resources index edged up 2.5 points to close at
1491.2.
</P>
<P>
The gold index slipped 3.6 points to 1566 while gold bullion
closed in Sydney at 343.7 U.S. dollars an ounce.
</P>
<P>
Data showing a 0.9-percent increase in gross domestic product
in the March quarter had little impact on shares.
</P>

National turnover totaled 383.65 million shares worth 1.002
billion Australian dollars (761.5 million U.S. dollars).

HONG KONG, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's flag carrier Cathay
Pacific announced today that testing and certification of
modifications to the Rolls-Royce 700 engine have taken place and
the airline's A330-300 aircraft fleet will progressively return to
service.
</P>
<P>
Cathay Pacific suspended its A330-300 services on May 24 after
three inflight shutdowns and a fourth on a Dragonair A330 created
questions about the Rolls-Royce Trent 700 engine's reliability.
</P>
<P>
The announcement said the problem, which was due to
insufficient lubrication of a bearing in the engine's step-aside
gearbox, has been rectified and Cathay Pacific and regulatory
authorities are satisfied that the modification is completely
airworthy.
</P>
<P>
The first revenue service of the A330-300 with the modified
Trent 700 engines will take place tomorrow morning while the rest
of the fleet will return to service over the next week. It is
expected that the modifications will be completed by June 13.
</P>
<P>
A total of 192 flights have been canceled since the suspension
of services, according to the announcement.

<HEADLINE> A Large Biological Potash Fertilizer Plant Operational in Hebei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, June 4 (Xinhua) -- One of the world's largest
biological potash fertilizer plants went into trial operation
recently in the city of Baoding in north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the plant, valued at more than 30 million yuan
(3.6 million US dollars) and one of the country's major industrial
projects, was undertaken by the Microbiological Research Institute
of the Hebei Provincial Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The plant will develop an annual production capacity of 10,000
tons, which is urgently needed for the country's farming
production, a local source said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that some 22.67 million ha of arable land, or
60 percent of the country's total, is farmland lacking in potash.
</P>
<P>
The research institute began studying the industrialization of
biological potash fertilizer in 1984.
</P>
<P>
The microbiological potash fertilizer they produced was applied
to more than 30 varieties of crops in 27 provinces and autonomous
regions, proving to be highly effective in boosting yields, with
unit output rising by 15 percent to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Their research and large-scale production of the potash
fertilizer has drawn worldwide attention.
</P>
<P>
Experts and entrepreneurs from 13 countries in Asia, Europe,
Africa and the United States are negotiating with the plant on
cooperative plans in technical training and trading for the
potash.

<HEADLINE> Sweden's Early Membership in EMU Ruled out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Sweden will not seek to join the
European Union's single currency system when it starts in January
1999, Swedish Prime Minister Goeran Persson said late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Persson said it would be "provocative" to present parliament
with a proposal to join the monetary union this fall, when the
public support for the initiative is so weak. He also said that
the consequences of a single currency are still too uncertain.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that Sweden is not closing the door to a
Swedish membership in the future.
</P>
<P>
A special Social Democratic Party congress would be needed
prior to joining the EMU, as well as some type of general
election, such as a public referendum.
</P>
<P>
According to press reports here today, many Social Democrats
fear that participation in the EMU will reduce the government's
freedom to maintain a high level of taxation, which is necessary
to finance Sweden's extensive social welfare programs.

LAGOS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian government on Tuesday
denied reports that some 300 Nigerian soldiers were being held
hostage by Sierra Leonean forces led by major Paul Johnny
Koromah.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman in Abuja described the reports as
propaganda by the coupists.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leonean state radio said on Tuesday that 300 Nigerian
soldiers taking part in the military intervention in Freetown

bombardment of Freetown by Nigerian navy vessels on Monday, and
some 100 people, mainly women and children, were seriously
injured.

Reports said the U.S. marines took off about 1,200 people by
helicopters.

(MOF) has published a detailed set of accounting standards for
business enterprises, the ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The new standards, officially known as Disclosure of Relevant

standards will play a positive role in the stock market
supervisory body's effort to improve its work.
</P>

It also said that right now the new standards will be limited
to listed companies. As of January 1 this year, listed companies
were required to observe the new standards when preparing their
financial sheets.
</P>
<P>
The MOF added that it will gradually formulate and publish
other accounting rules in order to further improve the quality of

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 4 (Xinhua) -- A popular sense of insecurity
has badly affected business of leading hotels in commericial city
of Johannesburg, the industrial sources complained.
</P>
<P>
Perceptions of Johananesburg as crime ridden have forced
Holiday Inn Garden Court, one of the inner city's leading hotel,
to discontinue certain services because of lack of guests, the
hotel managing director Helder Pereira said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said his hotel had cut down to 250 rooms from its orgininal
800 as it was no longer attracting enough guests.
</P>
<P>
The glittering modern hotel was opened in 1986 as the
five-star Johannesburg Sun International. In 1993, it was
downgraded to a three-star hotel to adjust to the changing
inner-city market, and it became the Holdday Inn Garden Court.
</P>
<P>
Pereira said although criminal cases, especially robberies and
muggings have dropped remarkablly in the streets around the hotel
last year, "the perceptions of crime are still there."
</P>
<P>
He claimed that no four- or five-star hotels would survive in
central Johannesburg becuase there was no market for them
anymore.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Finds Cause for Female Panda's Curbed Sexuality (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The method was first tried in 1989 on a female giant panda
named "Qingqing," who was in heat irregularly.
</P>
<P>
The experiment worked, and Qingqing gave birth to a cub named
"Xingxing." Qingqing had three more sets of twins in the following
three years.
</P>
<P>
"This demonstrates that a proper supplement of external
gonadotrophins can adjust the giant panda's internal secretion for
reproduction, which will maintain its effectiveness in the
following years and increase the chances of producing twins," Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
"The low reproductive ability of the giant panda is the major
cause for the endangering of giant pandas," the Chinese researcher
said.
</P>
<P>
"Most female giant pandas cannot enter into periods of sexual
excitement easily or at least not obviously so during the mating
season," he noted. "Even if they succeed in mating, the pregnancy
rate is very low."
</P>
<P>
Researchers believe that only 10 percent of giant pandas are
able to mate naturally.
</P>
<P>
The research paper of Chen and his group has been published in
the latest English-edition of "Chinese Science Bulletin," the
leading scientific journal in China.
</P>
<P>
The giant panda, with a population of less than 1,000, is the
world's best-known endangered species. It can only be seen in
mountains in southwest and northwest China.
</P>
<P>
The female giant panda normally bears one or two cubs once a
year.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Find Cause for Female Panda's Curbed Sexuality (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Why does a female giant panda often
give the cold shoulder to her boyfriend?
</P>
<P>
Scientists have theorized her sexual arousal is curbed by a
disorder of the reproductive hormones -- a finding which has
solved one of the trickiest problems faced in the breeding of the
endangered species.
</P>
<P>
A research group of Chinese zoologists have discovered that the
reason behind the giant panda's low reproductive ability is her
lack of hormones during mating season.
</P>
<P>
"We found that the secretion of gonadotrophins, hormones which
support and stimulate the function and growth of reproductive
cells, determines the periodic sexual excitement of female
pandas," said Professor Chen Dayuan, head of the group, at the
Institute of Zoology under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
"When the female giant panda produces a sufficient secretion of
gonadotrophins, she will attain a state of sexual excitement; when
inadequate, she will show indifference to the male even in the
mating season," Chen explained.
</P>
<P>
The lack of this secretion makes it difficult for the female
giant panda to produce eggs, or for the fertilized eggs to enter
the uterus and grow and mature, he noted, pointing out that "this
will severely hinder the reproduction of the species."
</P>
<P>
To get to the root of the problem, the research group has
experimented with giving supplemental hormones to the female giant
panda, so as to stimulate her into a period of sexual excitement
and help her to produce eggs, and ensure that the fertilized eggs
can attach themselves to the uterine wall.

<HEADLINE> Important Discoveries from Killer Quake in East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 4 (Xinhua) -- A group of Chinese and Iranian
seismologists discovered a big barrier lake and a
80-kilometer-long deformation and rupture zone after the killer
earthquake in east Iran last month, a Chinese specialist said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Li Xuanhu, Director of Earthquake Prediction and Prevention
Department of the China State Seismological Bureau, told Xinhua
that the joint research by the Chinese and Iranian seismologists
resulted in rare but important discoveries.
</P>
<P>
"The two discoveries from quake-stricken areas are of great
importance and high value to academic study in field of
seismology," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese specialist said that the seismologists of the two
countries are now making a comprehensive study on various kinds of
data obtained from the earthquake measured on 7.1 Richter scale on
May 10 and will make a prediction for the future quake development
in the area.
</P>
<P>
From May 24 to 31, a group of six Chinese specialists came to
Tehran and launched a joint research with 12 Iranian specialists
in Qaen and Birjand region, where about 2,000 people were killed
and thousands of others injured in the quake.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the deformation and rupture zone caused by the
quake is 80 km long with a direction from northwest to southeast.
</P>
<P>
"This kind of earth's surface deformation and rupture has been
rarely seen in the past and it is a typical case," he added.
</P>
<P>
For instance, he said, the displacement of shear of the
earth's surface is as wide as 2.8 meters in horizontal and
vertical displacement is as wide as 2.4 meters.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the Chinese and Iranian specialists also made
researches on type of house construction, destructive degrees and
damages inflicted by the killer quake, noting that the intensity
of the epicenter region was 10 degrees.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Reza Gheitanchi, head of Earthquake Seismology
Institute of Geophysics, Tehran University, told Xinhua earlier
that the cause for the killer quake is the Arabia plate on the
earth, which moved northward and collided with the stationary
Russia plate.
</P>
<P>
"Iran is being sandwitched between the two plates -- the
Arabia plate and the Russian plate. That is the cause of
the earthquake," said the Iranian seismologist.
</P>
<P>
The specialist analyzed that there are other two factors
leading to the strong earthquake. The Indian plate is also
moving northward to the Himalayas of China, thus causing lateral
pressure upon the eastern part of the Iranian plateau.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there is interaction in the eastern part of the
Iranian plateau due to direct and indirect forces generated by
the two moving plates. The Arabian plate is moving three
centimeters each year.
</P>
<P>
Gheitanchi said "We have earthquake belts in plate boundaries
such as the Zagros plate boundaries and the Alborz plate
boundaries. We have also many folds and faults inside the
Iranian plateau."
</P>
<P>
"There are also some local forces from the interaction of
these several forces. We have had several activities in the
past 30 years," he added.

<HEADLINE> China Applies CAD Technology With Success (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 4 (Xinhua) -- China's use of Computer Aided
Design (CAD) technology has revolutionized industrial design and
production.
</P>
<P>
To date, CAD has been applied at more than 10,000 research
institutes and 2,000 industrial manufacturers in 23 provinces and
cities.
</P>
<P>
CAD technology is used in a wide range of fields including
machine building, electronics, automobile, ship-building,
navigation, space, light industry, textiles and engineering design.
</P>
<P>
A total of 800 million yuan have been allocated for CAD
application. Over 250,000 scientists and technicians, many of whom
are research fellows and Ph.D students, have been involved.
</P>
<P>
CAD, an important aspect of electronic information, is a shared
technology that can transform traditional industries with new and
high technology, said Shi Dinghuan, director of the Industrial
Department under the State Science and Technology Commission.
</P>
<P>
As CAD replaces traditional drafting by hand with computers, it
shortens the cycle of developing a new product by 20 to 50 percent
and save a huge amount of money and raw materials as a result of
performing computer simulations, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Shenyang Transformer Plant saved 13 million yuan for
purchasing raw materials for analogue simulation in the 1988-89
period. The cycle of developing a new product is now three to five
times shorter than before CAD was implemented.

<HEADLINE> China's Forest Stock Keeps Increasing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- China's forest stock continues to
stay ahead of the country's consumption of forest resources, says
a report released here today by the State Bureau of Environmental
Protection (SBEP).
</P>
<P>
The latest report says that the country has a forest area of
133.7 million hectares, with the forest coverage rate up to 13.92
percent and the forest stock amounting to 11.7 billion cubic
meters.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China's total consumption of forest
resources was around 300 million cubic meters in 1995 and that of
bamboo was more than 490 million pieces.
</P>
<P>
The report, written by several ministries and commissions
including the SBEP and the Ministry of Forestry, reveals that
China afforested some 4.92 million hectares in 1996. A total of
535 million people were involved in voluntary tree-planting
activities, with 2.4 billion trees planted.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the report says that 5,055 forest fires occurred
last year, with more than 186,000 hectares of forest area
affected. The rate forest area affected has decreased to less than
0.075 percent, keeping the rate to a record low level for nine
consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the area of the forest affected by pest
disease has also decreased compared with the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The 17-page report, divided into two parts, gives details about
the achievements that China scored in environmental protection
last year and the problems that still remain.

<HEADLINE> Yangtze in Enviable Position for Industry Development (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Yangtze River will be in the
enviable position of having the world's largest riverside economic
belt along its valley, a Chinese researcher predicts.
</P>
<P>
The development of the Yangtze, which stretches for 6,400
kilometers and is the world's third longest river after the Nile
and the Amazon, can far exceed that of other large rivers in the
world, said Chen Wen, an associate research fellow with the
Nanjing Research Institute of Geography and Lakes of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar of the Young Scientists Forum recently
held in Beijing, Cai said that the Amazon claims the most water
resources of all rivers in the world and has a long navigation
channel on its mainstream. But the total length of the navigation
channels of its tributaries is far shorter than the Yangtze's.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the region which the Amazon traverses is overgrown
with tropical rainforests. Its valley is not considered for
large-scale development so that protection of the eco-system can
be ensured.
</P>
<P>
As for the Nile, most of it flows through dry areas and only
the river delta which has a "green corridor" has value for
economic development, she said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the Mississippi River in the United States, Chen
pointed out that the US focuses its economic development in its
eastern and western coasts and the Great Lakes area. It is only in
the past few decades that the country began to develop industries
along the middle and lower reaches of the river.

<HEADLINE> Yangtze in Enviable Position for Industrial Development (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Yangtze has geographical advantages, as it is the boundary
between China's northern and southern parts. In addition, water
and land resources are well-matched in the river reaches, leaving
a vast territory for development, she said.
</P>
<P>
Navigation channels of the Yangtze river system amount to an
unrivaled 70,000 km, extending to all parts of China. Furthermore,
long stretches of riverbanks and abundant hydropower resources of
the river remain to be developed.
</P>
<P>
Cai's views are shared by some 60 researchers from the Chinese
Academy of Sciences and another eight departments which have
conducted a comprehensive study on the Yangtze since 1993. And
their scientific achievements are of "great value for reference,"
agreed mayors of the cities along the river.
</P>
<P>
So far, national-level agricultural and sideline products bases
have been set up in the Dongtinghu, Jianghan and Lixiahe plains.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an industrial corridor including the manufacturing
of mechanical products, electronics, automobiles has been set
up. And a heavy industry belt including Baoshan, Shanghai,
Maanshan, Wuhan and Panzhihua steel plants as well as a
petrochemical industry belt including Jinshan, Yangtze, Zhenhai
and Yueyang petrochemical firms have been formed.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River reaches have a solid economic foundation:
the GNP of the areas along the river comprises 40 percent of the
country's total. Of China's seven major groups of cities, three
are located in the reaches, including the Shanghai-Ningbo-Hangzhou
area, the Sichuan Basin and the Jianghan Plain.
</P>
<P>
Since New China was founded in 1949, investment priority has
been given to the areas along the Yangtze. Areas along the river
have been given unprecedented development opportunities and have
speeded up economic growth along with the construction of the
Pudong New Area in Shanghai and the gigantic Three Gorges Project.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, the average growth rate of the Gross Domestic
Product of seven provinces and Shanghai was only 0.5 percentage
points higher than the national level, while in the 1990s, the
rate is two percentage points higher.
</P>
<P>
In response to the country's strategy of developing Pudong and
the Yangtze, provinces and municipalities along the river have
shifted their economic focus to the areas along the river, setting
up a group of economic-technological areas and high-tech zones in
the river delta and the cities of Wuhan, Chongqing, Yichang,
Jiujiang, Yueyang.
</P>
<P>
Areas in the middle and upper reaches of the river are planning
to develop the Wanjiang and Chuanjiang rivers, and build several
industrial belts in Jiangxi and Hubei Provinces.
</P>
<P>
Cai said as long as the government heeds the development of
resources, the economy, and environmental protection, and offers
favorable policies, the riverside industrial belt along the
Yangtze will become the largest of its kind in the world.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG,June 4 (Xinhua) -- South African government would
not rescind its decision to support a resumption of ivory
trade,minister of Environment Pallo Jordan told parliament
yesterday.

<HEADLINE> European Union Extends Sanctions Against Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) on Tuesday
announced the extension of its limited sanctions imposed on
Nigeria for another six months, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken by EU foreign ministers at a meeting in
Brussel, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Though it confirmed "certain positive signs from the
government", the meeting decided that the human rights situation
in Nigeria has not improved much to warrant a rescission of the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
EU imposed sanctions on Nigeria in the wake of the hanging of
author Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni activists by the
Nigerian government for murdur in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions include a ban on the issuance of visas to
Nigerian military leaders and their families, an arms embargo as
well as a freeze on sports links with any EU members.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine National Police will
start screening this week members of the Moro National Liberation
Front (MNLF) for integration into the police force, the Philippine
News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The screening of MNLF members for possible enlistment in the
police was suspended months ago after the authorities found out
that some applicants were not actual members of the MNLF.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the national police in Zamboanaga city,
Mindanao, was quoted by the agency as saying that a screening
committee has been created at the Zamboanaga Regional Police
Headquarters to go over documents certifying an applicant's
qualification for integration.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed between the government and the MNLF
last September to end a war in Mindanao, a total of 1,500 MNLF
members will be absorbed into the police force in Mindanao, and
5,000 MNLF members will be integrated into the government army.
</P>
<P>
While the national police is starting its screening of MNLF
members, the government army began the training of an initial 227
MNLF soldier candidates last Sunday. Over 1,000 MNLF members have
already passed qualification screening last March.
</P>
<P>
Similar trainings for other MNLF soldier candidates will be
held at training camps of the army divisions in Mindanao.

<HEADLINE> One Third of Egypt's Public Sector Goes Private by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 30 percent of the public
sector companies will have been sold by the end of June as Egypt
picks up its pace of privatization.
</P>
<P>
Local daily the Egyptian Gazette today quoted Information
Minister Safwat el-Sheirf as saying 79 state-owned companies have
been sold and 10 more will go on sale this month, all these making
up 28.2 percent of the public enterprises sector.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark here Tuesday after Prime Minister Kamal
el-Ganzouri reviewed the performance of Egypt's privatization
program with the Ministerial Privatization Committee.
</P>
<P>
The committee will discuss the sales of 20 other companies till
the end of this year, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
At the Tuesday meeting, the committee approved the
restructuring of 50 companies in preparation for marketing them,
Sherif said.
</P>
<P>
Sherif also revealed decisions taken by the committee regarding
the privatization of big-weight state-owned factories.
</P>
<P>
The government has given green light to sell part of the shares
of Alexandria Millers Company, Egyptian Engineering Industries
Company and Arab International Contracting Company.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Egypt has said that it has no plan for privatizing
the military factories.
</P>
<P>
"These factories and companies enjoy financial and
administrative regulations enabling them to work as successfully
as the private sector," said Minister of State for Military
Production Mohammad al-Ghamrawi Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The private sector took up 60 percent of the volume of economic
activities in Egypt by 1995, a 50 percent rise over the 1970s. The
sector is expected to shoulder 70 percent of the investments in
the coming years.
</P>
<P>
But the government has been reluctant to sell a majority stake
in vital sectors, such as oil and gas, telecommunications and
transports.

<P>
SHANGHAI, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-two airlines from 17
countries and regions offer air service to Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The city is second only to Beijing in terms of international
air service in China.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai started its first international air route in 1964, but
saw little progress in international air service until the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
According to local air authorities, Hongqiao International
Airport of Shanghai now handles 230 planes from overseas air
companies each week, accounting for 11 percent of the airport's
weekly traffic.
</P>
<P>
The air authorities attributed the boom of the city's
international air service to Shanghai's sustained economic
development and opening-up of Pudong New Area in early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Many overseas airways have seen clearly business potential in
Shanghai, and started and increased regular air service or added
chartered, special air services to Shanghai in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
The Hongqiao Airport also handled 9,050 planes from overseas
airlines last year, which transported 1.45 million passengers and
some 90,000 tons of cargo and mail.
</P>
<P>
Local departments have worked hard to create sound conditions
for overseas airlines to operate more easily in Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> S. African Sugar Producers Expand Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOAHANNESBURG, June 4 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's two major
sugar producer, Illovo Sugar and Tongaa-Hulett, are making active
efforts to expand business cooperation with Southern African
countries, local daily Business Day reported today.
</P>
<P>
The former has added operations in Malawi, Mauritius and
Swaziland to its existing interests in Mozambique and Kenya,
while the latter is active in Zimbabwe and Mozambique, and
looking to expand further in the region, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Illovo, South Africa's largest sugar producer, had acquired 50
percent of Mozambique's Maragra mill and the contract to mangage
the rehabilitation of a sugar mill in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
In Zimbabwe, Tongaat is expanding its Triangle sugar mill, the
world's lowest cost producer, and plans a 59-million U.S. dollar
new sugar-making factory in the Mazoe Valley, 60 kms outside
Harare.
</P>
<P>
Tongaat has also singed an agreement with Tate and Lyle and
the Mazoe Valley growers to establish a 140,000 tons a year sugar
mill which is due to come on stream by May 1999.
</P>
<P>
Southern Africa, one of the world's lowest-cost producers of
sugar, is set to expand export capacity in the next few years.
The South African sugar manufacturers are likely to be at the
forefront of this thrust, the local industrial sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Southern African region has an annual output of about four
million tons of sugar, of which it consumes about half and
exports the rest.

<P>
NAIROBI, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has warned African countries not to overrely on foreign loans,
saying such funds have become an impediment to the development of
the whole continent, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Due to huge borrowing from foreign countries, Africa now is
heavily indebted and could not achieve any meaningful development
under such a burden, he noted at the summit of the Organization
of African Unity (OAU) in Harare on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Although currently most African countries are banking on
foreign investors, it is prudent to evolve home-grown economic
activities that are self-sustaining, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Moi also urged rich countries to alleviate the debt burden on
Africa, noting that despite the ravages of colonialism, Africa
has not benefited from any relief arrangements like U.S.'s
Marshall Plan in Europe after the World War Two.

<HEADLINE> China's State-owned Enterprises Discharge Less Pollutants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Pollutants discharged by China's
state-owned enterprises decreased last year, says a report
released recently by the State Bureau of Environmental Protection.
</P>
<P>
The latest report says that of industrial waste emissions in
1996, the soot, ash and dust discharged by the state-owned
enterprises decreased by 9.5 percent and 12.1 percent compared to
the previous year, while their sulfur dioxide emissions stayed at
the same level.
</P>
<P>
The discharge of industrial waste water dropped by 7.2 percent
from 1995. The content of Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and heavy
metals in the discharged sewage decreased 8.4 percent and 14.3
percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 660 million tons of industrial solid waste was
generated, up 20 million tons over 1995. But, the amount of the
industrial solid waste accumulated decreased by 150 million tons
to 6.49 billion tons.
</P>
<P>
The report revealed that with the fast growth of township
industries, their discharge of pollutants was on rapid rise.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the emission of sulfur dioxide, soot, ash
and dust from the country's township enterprises contributed to
28.2 percent, 54.2 percent and 68.3 percent, respectively, to the
country's total discharge of corresponding pollutants in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The generation of solid waste from the township factories
accounted for 38.6 percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
The report also says that China completed 5,717 projects for
pollution control, and a total of 4.42 billion yuan (about 0.55
billion US dollars) was spent.
</P>
<P>
The 17-page report, divided into two parts, gives details about
the achievements that China scored in environmental protection
last year and the problems that still remain.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Tea Production Falls Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Kenya produced 54,970 tons of tea
between January and April, a 41.17 percent drop compared with the
same period of last year, according to Mombasa-based Africa Tea
Brokers (ATB).
</P>
<P>
In a report issued here on Tuesday, ATB said that output for
April 1997 was 10,920 tons, a fall of 12,570 tons or 53.58
percent from April last year.
</P>
<P>
Last March, Musa Sang, Chairman of the Kenya Tea Growers
Association, predicted that Kenya's tea production was likely to
drop this year due to the prolonged drought.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the drought had caused damage to tea
bushes in the main growing districts.
</P>
<P>
At present, ATB report noted that most areas had recovered
from the severe drought and factories had now reverted to normal
production.
</P>
<P>
Rainfall has given way to longer periods of sunshine in Key
growing areas but temperatures remained low and growth is
inhibited, it added.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Kenya's tea production rose by 5.2 percent from
244,000 tons in 1995 to 257,000 tons last year.
</P>
<P>
The increase was due to favourable weather conditions, timely
application of fertilizer and the improved prices.
</P>
<P>
Kenya, a leading tea producing country, last year exported a
record 244,000 tons of tea, overtaking Sri Lanka and India to
become the world's largest tea exporter.

MANILA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos today directed
the safe rescue of a local government official and two of his
companions abducted by a para-military group in the southern
Philippines last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The president issued the order to Secretary of the Department
of Interior and Local Government Robert Barbers and Intelligence
Chief of the Philippine National Police Cecilio Penilla.
</P>
<P>
In a handwritten memorandum, President Ramos asked them to give
a feedback to the Office of the President as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said Vice Mayor Romeo Dela Torre and two
of his companions were snatched by the para-military group on
their way back to the town of Sabagat, Agusan del Sur province.
</P>
<P>
Police said the kidnappers sent a letter to the police, saying
they would kill the captives at the first sight of a police or
military rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
Kidnapping has been a serious problem in the country. A total
of 241 people were kidnapped last year, with millions of pesos in
ransoms being paid by the hostages' families.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government has taken measures to curb the
rampant incidence of the crime, but achieved little progress.

<HEADLINE> Barak Elected New Labor Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Former army Chief of Staff Ehud
Barak was elected today the new leader of Israel's opposition
Labor party with a resounding victory.
</P>
<P>
After all votes in the Labor election held Tuesday were
counted just after midnight, Barak won 51 percent of the
vote.
</P>
<P>
He defeated comfortably three other candidates Yossi Beilin,
Shlomo Ben-Ami and Ephraim Sneh, who won 28 percent, 14 percent
and 6 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's election was in fact anti-climax, because Barak has
long been tipped to be the winner due to his prestige and
influence within the party.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Israel Radio after his sweeping victory, Barak
hailed the election as the first step by the Labor toward
returning to power. The party was defeated just one year ago by
the Likud party led by current Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging the heavy responsibility placed upon his
shoulder by Labor voters, Barak said he would do his best to
replace the Netanyahu government in the future, either by
pushing for early elections or working to defeat Netanyahu in
the next elections in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Barak expressed confidence that, with this sweeping victory,
he was able to form an "active and combative opposition" to
challenge the Netanyahu government.
</P>
<P>
He called upon other three candidates and all party members
to unite to face the challenge ahead. He said:"I believe that
together we can really create a kind of opposition that will put
a serious challenge to this government and will automatically
lead to the replacement (of it) by us."
</P>
<P>
Veteran Labor lawmaker Uzi Baram, a strong supporter for
Barak, agreed that "this is the first time in Labor's history that
such a clear, decisive victory was achieved. This will mean that
there will be no factions and no warring camps. We will defeat
(Netanyahu) in the next elections."
</P>
<P>
Outgoing leader Shimon Peres phoned Barak and congratulated
him on the victory. Barak said he would meet with Peres in the
next few days to complete the change of guard.
</P>
<P>
Meretz leader Yossi Sarid, an ally of the Labor, also
congratulated Barak and expressed the hope that "your candidacy
at the head of Labor's ticket will help bring down this
government."
</P>
<P>
The turnout of Tuesday's election was nearly 72 percent of
166,000 eligible Labor voters, though it was markedly lower in
the cities. The voting was conducted peacefully in 6,662 polling
stations, with only minor complaints in the day.
</P>
<P>
Barak, 55, a former chief of staff and the most decorated
soldier in Israeli history, is widely regarded as the only
person within the Labor that could pose a strong challenge to
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Although he entered the political circle only two years ago,
Barak has served as interior minister and foreign Minister in
the previous Labor government under the slain premier Yitzhak
Rabin and Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
Due to the similar military background, Barak is often
compared to Rabin as a charismatic and popular leader. He is
described as having great personal capacities -- brilliant powers
of analysis and can deal with details and keep big picture in
front of him at the same time.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Pays Lightning Visit to Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat arrived here early this morning for
further talks with President Hosni Mubarak on reviving the
deadlocked Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders will review efforts to propel the peace process
and the outcome of talks Mubarak's Political Adviser Osama al-Baz
held recently in Gaza and Israel with the Palestinian and Israeli
sides.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Head of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)
Political Department Farouk Kadoumi, also flew here this morning
from Harare, Zimbabwe, to take part in the talks between Arafat
and Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
It is the second meeting between the two Arab leaders in two
weeks on continued consultations on the peace process that
collapsed in March when Israel began construction of a new Jewish
settlement in disputed Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's visist came a week after Mubarak met with Israeli
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu in Egyptian Red Sea resort of
Sharm el-Sheikh in a bid to break ice in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who reportedly is floating an initiative to narrow the
difference between the Israelis and Palestinians, had hoped to
bring together Arafat and Netanyahu at a tripartite summit.
</P>
<P>
But Arafat's spokesman said such a meeting would be meaningless
when Israel continues its settlement construction in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
As part of intensified Egyptian mediation efforts, Baz left
here Tuesday for a four-day visit to Washington to brief the
U.S. administration on his several recent shuttle trips to the PNA
and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's office said the Egyptian efforts made "some
progress," but Palestinian sources said that Baz failed to get
Israeli response to the Palestinians' demand.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have made their return to the negotiating
table conditional on a halt of Israel's expansionary policy.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has refused to stop the new construction and instead
proposed building a neighborhood for Arabs near the Jewish housing
project. He also proposed measures to ease the limitations against
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's five-point plan aimed at persuading the two sides to
the negotiating table includes a temporary halt of settlement
activities in Jerusalem and the West Bank and the resumption of
security cooperation between the PNA and Israel.

<HEADLINE> Guizhou to Accelerate Reform and Opening-Up Pace: Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Guizhou Province in southwest China
will speed up its reform and opening-up by firmly grabbing today's
opportunity, said Governor Wu Yixia.
</P>
<P>
The province will implement three strategies to build a
prosperous Guizhou with science and education, usher in fresh
development by opening wider to the outside world, and make
sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
The governor also pledged that they would intensify
construction of infrastructure and strive hard to create sound
conditions for overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou, one of the country's poorest regions, has now been
presented with the best opportunity for development, as the
central government has been paying unprecedented attention to the
situation of this backward Chinese province and has started to
implement the strategy of developing the central and western areas
of China at a faster pace, the governor explained.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu, the central government, various central
ministries and departments, will put some 10 billion yuan or about
1.2 billion US dollars to support Guizhou's farming and
poverty-relief work beginning from this year to the year of 2000.
</P>
<P>
The province will be given preferential treatment in other
aspects including more approvals of major projects involving
infrastructure and energy development.
</P>
<P>
The central government has also listed Guizhou as one of key
provinces for development of resources during the Ninth
Five-Year-Plan Period (1996-2000) and will build three major
industrial bases along Wujiang River, in Liupanshui Prefecture,
and in areas along the Hongshui River, in a move to turn Guizhou
into an important energy and raw material center of south China.
</P>
<P>
The state will also invest to tap the province's plentiful
biological resources, developing green-food industries and
efficient farming in rural Guizhou.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of cooperation between coastal areas of the east
and western inland areas has also created chances for Guizhou's
economic development, and the province is advantageously located,
said the governor.
</P>
<P>
Four cities of Shenzhen, Qingdao, Ningbo, and Dalian have been
designated by the central government to help Guizhou and they have
signed agreements with Guizhou for economic cooperation over 100
projects, involving an investment of 1.87 billion yuan. Some of
these projects have already started construction or have been
ready for production.
</P>
<P>
Wu added that his province would invest 70 billion yuan in
building infrastructure from 1996 to 2000. With the operation of
Nanning-Kunming Railway Line, Guiyang-Zunyi Highway, and the new
airport of Guiyang, capital of Guizhou, this year, Guizhou will
also be adding 870 km of railway lines by the turn of this
century.

<HEADLINE> Major Powers Should Treat Each Other As Partners: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 4 (Xinhua) -- China hopes that in the process
of maintaining regional peace and prosperity, major powers would
learn to treat each other as partners, not as contenders, and no
one should try to seek a new rivalry where it is nonexistent, a
senior Chinese Foreign Ministry official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the first general meeting of the Council for
Security Cooperation in the Asia Pacific (CSCAP), Chen Jian,
Assistant Foreign Minister of China, said China places hope that
all the major powers will realize their responsibility to mankind.
</P>
<P>
"In the joint venture of maintaining regional peace and
prosperity, major powers would learn to treat each other as
partners, not as contenders. Nor should one try to seek a new
rivalry where it is nonexistent," he said.
</P>
<P>
The CSCAP was established by ten institutes of international
and strategic studies in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in July 1994 as a
non-governmental forum for multilateral security dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The founding CSCAP members represent institutes in Australia,
Canada, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand, and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia, New Zealand, the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea, and Russia have since joined and in December 1996, China
and Vietnam were admitted as members.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Chen noted that the United States is a major
Pacific power, which is placed to make her unique contribution to
peace and prosperity of the region.
</P>
<P>
"We, in China, attach great importance to the role of the
United States and to a stable relationship with the United States
in the firm belief that such a relationship would not only benefit
our two peoples but would more over be conducive to peace and
prosperity in the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
China is pleased to note that as a result of persistent efforts
by the parties concerned, Sino-US relations are moving in a right
direction, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This year has witnessed some important high level visits
between China and the United States. We are now preparing for the
exchange of state visits by the presidents of the two countries
that will take place later this year and next year," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the multi-polarization process of the world, the
Chinese official pointed out that one should not fail to see the
emergence of ASEAN (the Association of South Ease Asian Nations)
as a new power center and a significance force in Asia Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Noting that this year will witness the 30th anniversary of the
founding of the ASEAN and its enlargement from seven to ten
members, Chen said that it is of "vital importance" to China that
its relationship with the ASEAN is one of good neighborliness and
close cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"China highly commends and fully supports ASEAN's role in
promoting peace and development in the region. In this connection,
China is happy to attend the ASEAN plus three summit meeting," he
said.

<HEADLINE> 3-Phase Rupee Full Convertibility Suggested in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 4 (Xinhua) -- A special committee appointed by
the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on capital account convertibility
(CAC) has recommended a three-phase rupee full convertibility in
three years' time.
</P>
<P>
In its 166-page report to the RBI governor in Bombay Tuesday,
the committee said that controls on capital outflows and inflows
must be liberalized in a phased manner and total interest
deregulation coupled with a transparent exchange rate policy will
facilitate full convertibility by 2000.
</P>
<P>
It has suggested that CAC may be implemented in three phases,
beginning this year.
</P>
<P>
The report said that over a period of time, capital controls
turned ineffective, costly and even distorting.
</P>
<P>
It recommended that along with further measures to liberalize
capital inflows, it was desirable to simultaneously liberalize
controls on outflows as a means of contending with capital
inflows.
</P>
<P>
In the context of large capital inflows, CAC would relieve
pressure on the exchange rate, the monetary aggregates and thereby
enhance the effectiveness of domestic policies.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the committee has put some preconditions or
signposts for CAC in the country such as reduction of both the
union and state governments' gross fiscal deficit, introduction of
a consolidated sinking fund, a system of fiscal transparency and
accountability, etc.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Cruzeiro defeated Gremio to reach
the semi-finals of the Libertadores Cup in Porto Alegre, Brazil on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Cruzeiro, champions in 1976, went through 3-2 on aggregate
despite losing Tuesday's second leg 2-1 away to Gremio, winners in
1995 and semi-finalists last year.
</P>
<P>
However, neither team really deserved to remain in the
competition after a 61-foul match in which the finer arts of the
game were put to one side in favour of rough-arm tactics.
</P>
<P>
Ignoring the best traditions of Brazilian soccer, the teams
adopted a cynical approach and concentrated their energies on
kicking, provoking and threatening opponents.
</P>
<P>
Chile's Colo Colo, Cruzeiro's semi-final opponents next month,
will be well advised to ensure their first aid kit is well stocked
before visiting Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Cruzeiro increased their aggregate lead when Fabinho, who was
limping with a hamstring injury and about to be substituted, found
enough energy to get forward and knock in a far-post cross on the
hour.
</P>
<P>
Gremio, who had received six red cards in their previous nine
games in the competition, staged a late fightback when former
Brazil international Mauro Galvao and Ze Alcino scored twice in
three minutes.
</P>
<P>
Even coach Evaristo Macedo was banned from the touchline after
an incident in a previous round when he was also sent off.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- China will manufacture 100-seat
aircraft by 2003, the Aviation Industries of China (AVIC) has
announced.
</P>
<P>
A joint venture set up by the AVIC, the Science and Technology
Company of Singapore, and the AIA Company of Europe will turn out
105- and 125-seat airliners. The general assembly line will be in
China.
</P>
<P>
The AVIC holds 46 percent of the total shares of the Airbus
project; the AIA holds 39 percent; and the Singaporean enterprise,
15 percent.
</P>
<P>
European counterparts will provide technology and experience in
terms of engineering, production, quality inspection, and service,
AVIC said.
</P>
<P>
The project is an important step in AVIC's plan to manufacture
jet airliners by its own.
</P>
<P>
In line with practical situation, AVIC has tried a "three-step"
strategy:
</P>
<P>
-- to cooperatively produce MD planes, an effort to increase
manufacturing capacity;
</P>
<P>
-- to develop 100-seat airliners, as a breakthrough to produce
large domestic airliners; and
</P>
<P>
-- to manufacture large airliners with domestic technology.
</P>
<P>
At present, the country is expanding the production of MD-90
airliners, meaning the first-step plan is in full operation.
</P>
<P>
China is regarded as the largest potential aviation market in
the world. In the remaining years of this century, the country
will add 250 airliners.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Primary School Students in the Hometown of Giant Panda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, Jane 4 (Xinhua) -- Every morning on the way to school,
11 year-old primary school student Li Lin passes a stone board
beside the road that says: "Not only humans need care and love."
</P>
<P>
She told Xinhua reporter how she understood these words: the
wildlife is the friend of mankind, they should be loved and cared
for so as to live for ever on the earth with humans.
</P>
<P>
Li Lin is a fourth-grade student in Yuanjiazhuang Primary
School in northwest China's Shaanxi province. Located in the
remote, thickly-forested Qinling Mountains, the school is near the
Foping National Nature Reserve where more than 60 giant pandas
live.
</P>
<P>
Tang Xiangyun, Li Lin's teacher, said that helped by the
reserve staff, the school often holds field trips, lectures and
contests, to raise the awareness of wildlife protection among kids.
</P>
<P>
"Our school students not only refrain from hurting wild animals
and birds, but also often persuade their parents not to shoot or
cut indiscriminately," the teacher said proudly.
</P>
<P>
In the school yard when asked "what do you know about the
giant panda?" a group of students, mostly between the age of ten
to twelve, answered immediately, with everybody eager to put in a
word.
</P>
<P>
"In our village, people call the giant panda the `black and
white bear'. It is one of the animals under top state protection,"
said one student.
</P>
<P>
"It is one of our `national treasures', eating bamboos and
bamboo shoots in the mountain," another student said, adding that
it is loved worldwide but only exists in China.
</P>
<P>
Wang Jing, a 12-year-old five-grade student, said that giant
pandas should be well protected, or this already threated animal
would dispear forever and people in the future would not have a
chance to see them.
</P>
<P>
"Our teachers told us that we should be proud of the Foping
National Reserve near us, and students in the hometown of giant
pandas should all become good models in protecting wildlife and a
clean environment," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to an administration head of the Foping National
Reserve, during the 18 years since the Reserve was established,
the number of giant pandas and other rare animals has been
maintained stable or even increased.
</P>
<P>
"Our reserve has been free of any serious fires during the 18
years, and two years ago our reserve was successfully selected by
the Ministry of Forestry and the Global Environment Facility as
one of the ten demonstration reserves nation-wide," he said,
stressing that the primary students nearby "have played a certain
role in publicizing and supervising the protection of wildlife".

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ethnic Minority Runs Household Farms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Li, an ethnic minority in south
China's Hainan province, have abandoned their primitive
slash-and-burn agriculture, and instead run modern household farms.
</P>
<P>
The Li nationality people in Nankun Township of Tunchang
County have established more than 100 household farms, which
cover up to 10 hectares each, said a local government official.
</P>
<P>
When Fu Ruxian became the first to put 100,000 yuan into
cultivating 10 hectares of wasteland for a household farm six
years ago, other villagers thought he was crazy.
</P>
<P>
But his prosperity convinced them, and more villagers adopted
his plan.
</P>
<P>
Farmers like Fu might start out without even knowing how to use
fertilizer, but they are learning about scientific farming and the
market economy, and changing their traditional extensive
cultivation to intensive operations with the help of the local
government and the Han people.
</P>
<P>
Fu Ruxian cultivated another 5 hectare of land for arecas and
tea-oil trees last year. He is doing long-term projects as well as
short-term ones, to avoid risks and earn better profits.
</P>
<P>
Less competent households are combining their efforts to open
farms, and running farms has become popular among the Li people.

<P>
SINGAPORE, June 4 (Xinhua) -- China is "quite optimistic" that
peace and stability in the Asia Pacific region will be maintained
and freedom of navigation in the South China Sea will be ensured,
a senior Chinese Foreign Ministry official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the first general meeting of the Council for
Security Cooperation in the Asia Pacific (CSCAP), Chen Jian,
Assistant Foreign Minister of China, said that generally speaking,
the situation in the South China Sea is stable and with much at
stake, no one in the region will want to raise a rumpus.
</P>
<P>
Despite the probability that incidents might occur pending an
eventual solution to overlapping claims, Chen said, "With our
overriding common interest and given the political will, those
challenges are not impossible to meet."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the disputes in the region should be
resolved through peaceful means rather than by resorting to the
use or threat of force and, pending the eventual solution, parties
concerned should exercise utmost self-restraint and seek to shelve
the disputes and go for joint development.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the parties concerned shall place the
development of friendly bilateral relations at the top and not let
such disputes undermine their common endeavor for peace and
prosperity in the region.
</P>
<P>
"China has and will continue to follow these above-mentioned
principles," Chen said, adding, "with much at stake, no one in the
region will want to raise a rumpus."

The CSCAP was established by ten institutes of international

in Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
According to the court, the drug trafficking gang, headed by

</P>
<P>
Zhang purchased a total of 37.3 kg of heroin in the border

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Reactor to Be Built in Central Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's first research nuclear
reactor will be built in its central province of Nakhon Nayok, the
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Thai cabinet has approved the project recently, but the
construction of the nuclear reactor could not start as a legal
procedure on nuclear safety for the project has not been passed.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's nuclear safety regulations require any investors in
a nuclear project to submit a safety analysis report certified by
the United States Nuclear Regulations Commission (USNRC).
</P>
<P>
Yet, General Atomic, a U.S. company that won the bidding for
the project has not yet submitted such a report to the Nuclear
Safety Sub-committee of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Kriangsak Phattharakhom, secretary-general of the Office of
Atomic Energy for Peace, said that the cabinet approval of the
project and the safety requirement were different matters, and the
bid winner will have to clear safety hurdles itself.
</P>
<P>
The office earlier had proposed that the Nuclear Safety
Sub-committee drop its requirement for a safety report certified
by the USNRC, saying that Thai nuclear personnel were good enough
to certify the safety of a nuclear project themselves.
</P>
<P>
However, the sub-committee rejected the proposal, arguing the
expertise of Thai officials were not strong enough.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Sets Budget Deficit Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria has decided to limit this
year's budget deficit to an equivalent of 6.2 percent of the gross
domestic product.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the targets agreed upon between Finance Minister
Muravei Radev and An Makgark, the Bulgaria representative of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference today after their talks, the two
officials explained that the target is higher than planned because
the government will have no additional revenues to cover the
spending due to the stagnation of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
As the possibility to cover deficit with new borrowing has been
ruled out, Bulgaria will have to depend on the proceeds from
privatization for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
Under a draft budget, the inflation rate at the end of this
year will be 566 percent and that for the entire fiscal year will
reach 1059 percent.
</P>
<P>
IMF has paid its first loan of 160 million U.S. dollars to
Bulgaria this year and, if the country has fulfilled all its
obligations, will soon pay two additional loans of 130 million and
86 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the World Bank is expected to provide a loan
of 80 million dollars for restructuring the economy and reducing
the unemployment rate.

<P>
BANGKOK, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will launch a two-year
Amazing Thailand Campaign in 1988 and 1989 to promote the
country's tourism industry, according to prime minister's office
minister Piyanat Watcharaporn.
</P>
<P>
Thailand hopes to attract 17.18 million tourists and bring in
revenues of 600 billion baht (24 billion US dollars), Piyanat, who
oversees the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT), was quoted today

Tourism has long been the country's leading foreign exchange
earner. Last year, about 7.2 million foreign tourists visited
Thailand earning the country more than 7 billion US dollars) in
foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
"This is a good chance to promote the country. In 1998 Thailand
will host the Asian games and a number of big ceremonies to
celebrate the sixth cycle of the King of Thailand," Piyanat said.
</P>
<P>
During the campaign, the TAT will focus its promotion effort on
40 key markets in the Asia-pacific, Europe and the United States.
East Asia will be the main target.
</P>
<P>
The TAT has targeted shopping as the best means of increasing
foreign exchange during the coming two years and has plans to
spearhead a number of promotional campaigns such as discount
coupons for tourists and a central shopping district in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
With the cooperation of local department stores, "national
sales" will be organized every June and November to attract
international spenders, and a better system of tax refunds will be
implemented to support that project.
</P>
<P>
Thai food will also be on show, with the organization promoting
Amazing Thailand at 4,000 Thai restaurants around the world. There
will also be a Thai food conference in Thailand in July to
publicize Thai cuisine.

<HEADLINE> Chittagong Port Users Threaten Work Abstention Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The users of Bangladesh's largest
Chittagong port has given ultimatum to the government to concede
to its demand for use of private equipment in the cargo handling
by June 5, port sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The Port Users Forum of Chittagong threatened to paralyze cargo
handling in the port unless their demand is accepted forthwith.
"We will be then left with no option than resort to hardlines and
work stoppage," said convener of the Port Users Forum Kamaluddin
Ahmed.
</P>
<P>
This is for the third time the Port Users Forum is threatening
to go for work abstention in support of its demand for the right
to use private equipment in the cargo handling in the port.
</P>
<P>
On both occasions, the forum at last moment called off its
abstention program on request from the government's highest
authority who reportedly pledged to look into the demand
sympathetically.
</P>
<P>
The issue on the use of private equipment began from March this
year when a shipping company brought some of its equipment inside
the port jetty for handling its cargo, which was resisted by the
port's workers.
</P>
<P>
The port users also observed boycott in March demanding use of
private equipment, which was already permitted by the authorities.
</P>
<P>
The last the forum served notice for work abstention was on May
11. However, the boycott program was called off after a meeting
with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on the night of May 10.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar Looking to Join AFTA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar are to
submit their inclusion list of products for the common effective
preferential tariffs (CEPT) scheme when they are admitted into the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in July, ASEAN
Secretary General Dato Ajit Singh said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The presentation of the CEPT inclusion list is one of the first
steps taken to join the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA).
</P>
<P>
"As a result of the very close contact and assistance we at the
secretariat have been giving, we have helped them to draft the
initial package offer for the CEPT products," officials at the
ASEAN Secretariat today quoted Singh as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the three countries had already submitted an indicative
inclusion list to ASEAN senior economic officials in April.
</P>
<P>
"They are supposed to give us the final inclusion list on the
day they join ASEAN," he added.
</P>
<P>
At present, ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The CEPT is the main instrument designed to make ASEAN a free
trade area by 2003. Through the scheme, tariffs of all
manufactured goods will be reduced to 5 percent or less.
Agricultural products are excluded from the CEPT scheme.
</P>
<P>
Under the CEPT scheme, each ASEAN member draws up a product
list whereby goods are divided into: exclusion list, temporary
list and the general exception list.
</P>
<P>
According to Singh, the prospective members have decided to
submit the final product list at the 29th ASEAN Ministerial
Meeting in October.
</P>
<P>
As new members, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar have a 10-year grace
period starting in 1998 before they are fully integrated into AFTA
in 2008.
</P>
<P>
All three countries are currently doing their utmost to meet
these requirements, Singh said.
</P>
<P>
Singh also confirmed that a meeting of ASEAN economic ministers
will be held in Jakarta next week.
</P>
<P>
The special half-day meeting was called to draft an economic
vision for the grouping in the next century, he added.

<P>
KATHMANDU, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's main opposition party has
decided to launch protest programs across the country later this
month against the alleged irregularities by the government during
the recent local elections, sources here said today.
</P>
<P>
The decision came out Tuesday at the end of a three-day meeting
of the Nepali Congress (NC) party's Central Working Committee
(CWC), which was held here in the wake of the party's debacle in
the last month's local polls.
</P>
<P>
Election results declared so far show that the NC party has
lost its majority control of the country's over 4,000 local
administration bodies at village, municipality and district levels
to the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist,
CPN-UML), the biggest partner of Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur
Chand's ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
NC leaders at the CWC meeting vehemently accused the government
of carrying out irregular activities during the local elections to
give advantage to the major ruling party, according to party
sources.
</P>
<P>
The meeting decided to hold protest rallies and mass meetings
in all the 75 districts of the country simultaneously on June 15,
they said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the NC party has formed a special committee to
collect comprehensive facts and statistics about the alleged
election irregularities by ruling party workers.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that some NC activists on Monday picketed
the party central office, demanding the resignation of party
president Girija Prasad Koirala as he failed to lead the party to
retain its majority control at local levels.

<HEADLINE> Pollution-related Diseases Become Major Killers In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Respiratory diseases and cancer
have become one of the major killers threatening the health of the
Chinese people, said a report released by the National
Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA).
</P>
<P>
Research shows that respiratory diseases and cancer are closely
connected to the quality of the environment.
</P>
<P>
The latest report on China's environmental situation said that
the rate of death from respiratory diseases ranked the first and
the fourth respectively among all the causes of death in the
country's rural and urban areas last year, 1.61 per 1,000 persons
and 0.92 per 1,000 persons.
</P>
<P>
The report, written by a number of ministries and commissions
including NEPA and the Ministry of Public Health, also
revealed that the rate of death from cancer in the urban and rural
areas was 1.31 per 1,000 persons and 1.05 per 1,000 persons,
respectively in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 death rate from cancer in rural areas is lower than
1995's 1.11 per 1,000 persons; the first time since 1991 that the
figure has declined.
</P>
<P>
The report said that 65 pollution accidents happened last year,
leading to the illness of more than 4,300 people and the death of
10 people.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 41.5 percent of the accidents were caused
by urban waste water and 33.8 percent by industrial pollution.
</P>
<P>
The 17-page report, divided into two parts, gives details about
the achievements that China scored in environmental protection
last year and the problems that still remain.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Kunmin, deputy director of the NEPA, said that the
release of the report is to give the public a clear idea of the
country's environmental situation, improving people's
environmental awareness, and to promote global cooperation and
exchange.

BANGKOK, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh has proposed that Thailand and Myanmar agree on a
permanent border to prevent future disputes, according to Mongkol
Ampornphisit, supreme commander of the Thai armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Mongkol was quoted today by local press as saying that Chavalit
asked him to propose to Myanmar authorities to use the middle of
the Moei river to demarcate the border to avoid problems resulting
from changes in the river's course or different interpretations of
the Thai-anglo treaty.
</P>
<P>
Mongkol said he will soon discuss the proposal with Thai army
commander-in-chief Chettha Thanajaro and ask the premier to assign
Chettha to lead a Thai delegation to Yangon to settle the issue
once for all.
</P>
<P>
Mongkol said the dispute over Myanmar's dredging of the Moei
river, which forms the border between Thailand and Myanmar, must
be handled with the consent of both parties.
</P>
<P>
An islet has been created in the Moei river because of a change
in the river's course, forcing the river further into Myanmar's
land, and Myanmar moved in heavy equipment and workers to try to
dredge the river to restore the river to its original position.

<P>
COLOMBO, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan troops, resuming their
operation "Jaya Sikuru" (Certain Victory) after a six day pause
were pushing further into rebel-held territory in the North on
Tuesday, according to informed sources today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said more rebel targets come in for heavy attack by
 air force and artillery as the troops were closing in on the
heavily fortified rebel-controlled Northern town of Puliyamkulam.
</P>
<P>
Air force jets attacked four identified rebel targets while the
army had attacked six others in the past day.
</P>
<P>
According to a military report, while troops continue to
strengthen defenses in the newly recaptured areas, terrorists in
small groups are attempting to infiltrate to carry out
reconnaissance missions, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have meanwhile accused the government of firing
artillery on villages killing many and rendering thousands of
civilians homeless.
</P>
<P>
The government troops launched Operation Jaya Sikuru on May 13
using two army divisions consisting of about 20,000 in a bid to
open a supply route to Jaffna Peninsula by recapturing 75
kilometers of highway running through LTTE held territory.
</P>
<P>
The troops had earlier recaptured and consolidated defenses in
Omanthai and Nedunkeni which were held by the rebels of the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) fighting for a separate
state in the country.

BANGKOK, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Industry Ministry has

Thailand as the demand rises on the world market.

However, Thai Industry Minister Korn Dabbaransi said that the

</P>
<P>
The minister said that local gypsum will be used only for the

</P>

Last year as gypsum prices slumped on the world market,
Thailand imposed a ban on gypsum mining in a bid to reduce gypsum
exports and encourage exports of gypsum-made products with a quota

<P>
JAKARTA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
rebuked the U.S. State Department for its remarks about the
Indonesian general election, calling them "inappropriate".
</P>
<P>
"I've read the statement by the U.S. State Department
spokesman, and I think it showed ignorance or lack of
understanding of out system," Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian minister expressed his regret over the U.S.
statement, saying that it showed lack of appreciation about what
Indonesians have been trying to develop with its democracy.
</P>
<P>
"I expected foreigners to at least try to understand that there
are different kinds of democracy, and any evaluation must be based
on an appropriate knowledge of the system," he added.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman John Dinger described the
Indonesian electoral system Friday as so tightly controlled by the
government that it "severely limits political competition".
</P>
<P>
Calling on the Indonesian government to investigate allegations
of vote-rigging and cheating, Dinger said in Washington: "more
broadly, we also believe Indonesia should move toward a political
system in which the will of the people can be heard."
</P>
<P>
The May 29 general election gave an overwhelming victory to the
dominant party Golkar, which won over 74 percent of the votes. The
United Development Party (PPP) obtained 23 percent and the
Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) 3 percent, according to figures
released by the National Election Committee.
</P>
<P>
Based on the provisional results, Golkar is expected to win 325
of the 425 seats in the House of Representatives that were up for
grabs, PPP 90 and PDI 10.
</P>
<P>
About 124.7 million Indonesians were eligible to vote in the

CARACAS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese oil company today beat 11
other companies in contending a bid to explore an oil field on the

The Chinese company is obliged to invest a minimum of 24
million dollars during the next three years, including

ROME, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Italy will immediately denominate its
debt in the single European currency when the euro is launched on
January 1, 1999, the ANSA news agency quoted government officials
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Italian cabinet passed a bill today mandating the
government to introduce the single European currency.
</P>
<P>
Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi said Italy's immediate
conversion of the debt into euro "will help to create a critical
mass of the currency on the market, creating confidence that will
enhance the system's credibility."
</P>
<P>
He said: "The government has been conscious from the beginning
that participation in the single currency is in the national
interest and that any suggestion of a postponement runs against
the interests of Italy and of Europe."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Romano Prodi said the euro mandate bill means
business. It was far "more than a formal measure".
</P>
<P>
The provisions of the bill also include the denomination of
stock and other markets in euro, and the calculation and payment

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo today called on all Mexicans to redouble their efforts in
striving for a vigorous, long-lasting economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Present the 1997-2000 National Program for the Financing of
Development (PRONAFIDE), Zedillo said that the current generation
will be the first in the country's history to enjoy economic
growth combined with total democracy.
</P>
<P>
He was optimistic over an economic growth because the
Pronafide's goals are both prudent and ambitious.
</P>
<P>
One of the program targets is to create millions of jobs every
year and reduce the number of the jobless.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, he said, an economic growth requires an increase
in investment on a systematic basis until it accounts for at least
25 percent of the gross domestic product by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth cannot depend "imprudently" on external
savings, he said. It should be complemented by internal savings.
</P>
<P>
Pronafide envisages actions that will strengthen the exporting
sector, promote foreign direct investment, ensure economic and
financial stability, improve credit conditions and maintain free
access to capital markets.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 4 (Xinhua) -- Norbert Holl, UN special envoy on
the Afghan issue has said that "the only solution to the Afghan
conflict is a broad-based government".
</P>
<P>
Holl made the remarks at a press conference held in the Afghan
capital of Kabul Tuesday, according to a report reaching here
today.
</P>
<P>
Both the Taliban and their rivals paid only lip service to this
principle, because they selfishly wanted to keep power for
themselves, Holl said.
</P>
<P>
"A broad-based government is a system of power-sharing," Holl
added.
</P>
<P>
"All Afghan parties claim they support my peace initiative, but
unfortunately I have the feeling they see a military solution more
important than negotiation," Holl said.
</P>
<P>
Holl, who is in Kabul for talks with the Taliban, said that no
one "political or ethnic group" in Afghanistan is strong enough to
impose its rule on the whole country.
</P>
<P>
Holl said that he will visit the southern Afghan city of
Kandahar, the Taliban headquarters Wednesday, to resurrect the
concept of power-sharing.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to hold similar discussions with the opposition
alliance.
</P>
<P>
the UN special envoy ruled out any possibility of an immediate
ceasefire in the current Afghan fighting, which has dramatically
escalated in the past two weeks.

<HEADLINE> Slaney Seeks USOC Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Mary Slaney and two other
athletes suspended for doping have appealed to the US Olympic
Committee to win a berth at the World Athletics Championships.
</P>
<P>
"They want us to help resolve the issue," said USOC executive
director Dick Schultz.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, world athletics governing body IAAF said it was
suspending Slaney, Sandra Farmer-Patrick and a third undisclosed
US athlete believed to be hurdler Stephon Flenoy because USA Track
and Field failed to promptly resolve cases against them.
</P>
<P>
That will deny them a chance to compete in the US national
championships next week in Indianapolis -- the qualifying meet for
the world championships at Athens in August.
</P>
<P>
Slaney, Flenoy and Farmer-Patrick purportedly tested positive
at last year's US Olympic trials but were allowed to compete in
the Atlanta Games.
</P>
<P>
"It's strange the IAAF would suspend them without giving them a
hearing," Schultz said. "I don't know what their rationale was."
</P>
<P>
Flenoy and Patrick-Farmer contacted the USOC and asked for
reinstatement in time to compete at the US nationals. Slaney made
a written complaint to the USOC seeking a hearing by Friday so she
can compete at Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
US officials had results that showed Slaney with a
higher-than-allowed level of male hormones in her body at last
year's US Olympic trials, but allowed her to compete at the
Atlanta Games and in meets since.
</P>
<P>
While US officials delayed any hearing or action against her,
Slaney passed six later tests for the masking agent and said her
high male hormone ratio came from natural causes.
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old Slaney is a four-time Olympian who made a
surprising comeback merely to reach the Atlanta Games. Jamaica
born Farmer-Patrick, 35, is a former US 400-meters record-holder.
</P>
<P>
Slaney will not go to court and fight for the right to compete
in next week's US meet.

integration," Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, told
Argentine senators on May 26.
</P>
<P>
It will be up to the economic authorities of the four member
countries of the Mercosur: Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and
Uruguay, to decide when it is time to establish a timetable to
implement the two above-mentioned proposals made by Cardoso.
</P>
<P>

balance continue to grow as they are doing now, exports by the
agricultural and livestock sector in Brazil will exceed 20 billion
dollars by the end of 1997, an increase of 11 percent compared
with that of last year.
</P>
<P>
During the first quarter of this year, exports of animal and
vegetable products increased 12 percent compared with the same
period in 1996, to reach the sum of 3.59 billion dollars.

ASUNCION -- The interior ministers for Argentina, Brazil,
Paraguay, Uruguay and Chile met on May 30 and 31 in Asuncion
to analyze common strategies designed to prevent international
organized crimed.
</P>
<P>
The ministers agreed on the need to give a "transnational
response" to "transnationalistic crime", maintaining that to
combat globalized crime, national police forces should not
concern themselves solely with internal matters but act in a
conjoined way with their counterparts from other nations.
</P>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazil's gross domestic product (GDP) will
grow 4 percent this year compared with 1996, according to the
Institute of Applied Economic Research (IPEA).
</P>
<P>
Between January-March 1996, the GDP grew 4.2 percent over the
same period last year and the economy will maintain its growth

In a meeting held May 25 and 26, they reaffirmed their support
to go ahead with the negotiations with the Mercosur and other

American Integration Association (ALADI).
</P>
<P>
As for the deadline for complying with the tariff-elimination
program between the Andean Community and the Mercosur, the

for more sensitive products. (to be continued)

<HEADLINE> Muslim Rebels Warn of Breakdown of Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government's
insistence on deploying more troops to a controversial area in the
south could result in the breakdown of peace talks with Muslim
rebels, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Al-Haj Murad, vice chair for military affairs of the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), said a major reason for the
slowdown in the talks was the military continuing "encroachment"
on MILF's stronghold in Buldon, Maguindanao province.
</P>
<P>
The government and the MILF have held four rounds of
preliminary talks so far but did not achieve any substantial
results. They are scheduled to hold the fifth round of
negotiations next month. The government wants to forge a
comprehensive ceasefire agreement with the rebels as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
"Now they have plans to deploy more soldiers in Buldon to
secure Mayor Macarampat Manalao," said Murad, adding that more
deployment of troops in the highly sensitive area would threaten
the talks.
</P>
<P>
Government chief negotiator Fortunato Abat said earlier that
the military will send more soldiers to Buldon to install Manalao,
who has not been going to his office since being elected in 1995
because of what he claimed as threats from the MILF.
</P>
<P>
Buldon is a military headquarters of the MILF, a splinter
faction of the mainstream Moro National Liberation Front which
signed a final peace agreement with the government last year.
</P>
<P>
With 12,000 members, the MILF proclaimed itself the biggest
rebel group in the country. It has had a number of clashes with
government troops near Buldon since the beginning of the year.

<HEADLINE> North China Increasing Farmland By Removing Brick Kilns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, May 4 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei Province
has recovered nearly 10,000 hectares of farmland in the past two
years by tearing down brick kilns that were violating land-use
regulations.
</P>
<P>
It has removed 1,134 kilns in the process, as part of an
attempt to increase grain production by five billion kg at the end
of the century, by increasing the amount of farmland.
</P>
<P>
The province has more than 6,000 kilns, occupying a total of
30,000 ha of arable land. The amount of earth used for bricks
annually eats up more than 5,000 ha of land, 70 percent of which
is fertile farmland. Per-capita land area has fallen to slightly
more than one-tenth of a hectare.
</P>
<P>
Brick and tile production has become a major industry in the
economic development of townships and villages, but the problem is
how to get good economic returns without damaging the farmland, a
provincial official said.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with State requirements, the province has begun
to tighten controls on land-use, requiring land-use permits, and
improving reclamation of brick kiln-occupied land.
</P>
<P>
Hebei is also making an effort to replace bricks made of earth
with new building materials.

MONTEVIDEO -- The "Eco America 97" summit will be held in
Montevideo between August 26-29 with the participation of the four
Mercosur presidents and the environmental delegations from the 22
members nations of the Latin American Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The forum's objective is to analyze the processes on
sustainable development in Latin America and the successful
experiences and their potential adaptation to the reality of other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Several initiatives designed to conserve the natural
environment will be brought up and a call will be made to
recognize the environmental impacts and the pollution generated by
several manufacturing activities.
</P>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO -- On June 10 the Mercosur will have its first
official contact with Peru, a country that abandoned the Andean
Pact and hopes to join this bloc, said Agustin Espinsosa, the
chief of Uruguay's Foreign Ministry Integration and Mercosur
Division.
</P>

BUENOS AIRES -- On May 30, the Chamber of Argentine Exporters

Carlos Menem's government will apply to prevent tariff frauds.
</P>
<P>
The Cera sustains that this control, that will be granted to
private companies, violates the agreements signed by the four
country partners of the Mercosur Tariff Union.
</P>
<P>
"The non-exclusion of Mercosur partners will make trade
difficult due to an administrative stumbling block, which is
prohibited by existing agreements," pointed out Cera President
Enrique Mantilla.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Steffi Graf was tumbled out from the
French Open when she lost to Amanda Coetzer in the quarter-finals
here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in ten years that Graf is not among the
top two players in the world.
</P>
<P>
Graf has won this Grand Slam tournament five times, including
the last two years. With 21 Grand Slam titles, she is by far the
leading active player on the tour.
</P>
<P>
But her defeat Tuesday, coupled by Monica Seles' 3-6, 6-2, 7-5
victory over Mary Joe Fernandez, dropped her to No. 3 in the WTA
Tour rankings, with Seles moving up to No. 2.
</P>
<P>
Martina Hingis, the 16-year-old sensation who is unbeaten this
year, remained on course for her second straight Grand Slam by
ousting doubles partner Arantxa Sanchez Vicario 6-2, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
In the women's semis Thursday, Hingis will face Seles, while
Coetzer will face Iva Majoli, the seventh-seed Croatian who beat
Ruxanda Dragomir 6-3, 5-7, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
While in the men's section, defending campion Yevgeny
Kafelnikov, who never believed he could retain the title, went out
against Gustavo Kuerten.
</P>
<P>
Kuerten won 6-2, 5-7, 2-6, 6-0, 6-4 and will next meet another
outsider, qualifier Filip Dewulf of Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Dewulf beat Magnus Norman, conqueror of Pete Sampras, 6-2, 6-7
(7-2), 6-4, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
That means that at least one unseeded man will make it to the
final.
</P>
<P>
The other semifinal berth will be decided Wednesday when No. 16
Sergi Bruguera, the lowest seed, faces Morocco's Hicham Arazi, and
Patrick Rafter takes on Galo Blanco.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rican Banana Exports Rebound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica's banana exports rose
by 11 percent in April, compared with the same month last year
after a sustained drop in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter, Costa Rica exported 21.4 million boxes of
bananas, 25.6 million less than in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the National Banana Corporation (CORBANA) is
to export 127 million boxes this year, but the target appears to
be difficult to reach, due to the reduction in the first three
months.
</P>
<P>
Last year, banana exports brought in 576 million U.S. dollars
for banana growers. CORBANA plans to export 765 million dollars
worth of bananas this year, but it also seems hard to fulfill the
goal.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican banana growers have joined other Latin American
banana growers to try to keep the United Banana Exporting
Countries (UPEB) alive.
</P>
<P>
Last week the UPEB held a meeting in Panama where member
countries agreed to set up a system of statistics on bananas on
the internet, which will help banana growers with their
decision-making.

KIEV, June 3 (Xinhua) -- There is no winner or loser between
Ukraine and Russia following the signing of the three agreements
on the Black Sea Fleet last week, Ukraine Prime Minister Pavel
Lazarenko said today.
</P>
<P>
Neither Moscow nor Kiev had made compromises in the these
agreements. They were fully in the interests of the two countries,
Lazarenko told a press conference,
</P>
<P>
Lazarenko and his Russian counterpart, Viktor Chernomyrdin,
wound up disputes on the fleet by signing the agreements on May
28, paving the way for a broad friendship and cooperation treaty
sealed by Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma and his Russian
counterpart Boris Yeltsin on May 31.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreements, Russia will lease for 20 years three bays
of Sevastopol -- Sevastopolskaya, Yuzhnaya and Karantynnaya-- as
its naval base.
</P>
<P>
Lazarenko hopes to use the leasing fees to repay its gas debts
to Russia. He said the leasing fees were roughly equivalent to the
gas debt which stands at about three billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> FIFA to Tell French to Stop Hellebuyck Leaving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- World soccer governing body FIFA is
to tell the French Football Federation (FFF) to stop teenage star
David Hellebuyck leaving his club Lyon for 1996 Spanish champions
Atletico Madrid.
</P>
<P>
FIFA have decided that 18-year-old Hellebuyck, a junior French
international striker, could not have his letter permitting him to
join Atletico because he was under contract to Lyons till June 30
-- no player can be transferred from France unless they receive a
letter from the FFF allowing them to.
</P>
<P>
Hellebuyck, who was due to earn 2,500 pounds (3,750 dollars) a
week with Atletico's junior team who are in the second division,
had signed an agreement with the Spanish club on March 31.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Michel Aulas, the Lyon president, said that under the
present ruling he would demand a transfer fee for his young star.
</P>
<P>
"If he has to leave then it will cost Atletico at least 800,000
pounds," Aulas said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's anti-Taliban forces
have formed a new alliance in a bid to check the Islamic militia's
taking over of the whole country.
</P>
<P>
The new alliance, named the United Islamic Front for Salvation
of Afghanistan (UIFSA), includes the National Islamic Movement,
former defense minister Ahmad Shah Masood's forces, the Shiite
Hezb-i-Wahdat, the Hezb-i-Islami of former premier Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar and a former Mujahedeen faction headed by Pir Sayed
Gailani, reports reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
The UIFSA was ready to hold talks with the Taliban, who control
two-thirds of the Afghan territory, the reports quoted an
opposition spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
The UIFSA replaces the previous opposition coalition Council
for Defense of Afghanistan under ousted warlord Abdul Rashid
Dostum who fled Afghanistan after his key commander Abdul Malik
revolted against him last month.
</P>
<P>
Malik helped the Taliban to enter Mazar-i-Sharif but four days
later, turned against the Islamic militia, forcing it out of the
city after heaving fighting that left hundreds of fighters dead.
</P>
<P>
He has assumed leadership of the National Islamic Movement
which was led by Dostum before his flight.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Front replaces the earlier anti-Taliban alliance
that did not include Hekmatyar and Gailani.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 4 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Branch of the
Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ) has received 20-odd applications
for loans in renminbi since China approved foreign banks handling
renminbi transactions two months ago.
</P>
<P>
As one of the two foreign banks approved by the People's Bank
of China, China's central bank, the Industrial Bank of Japan
started renminbi operations on March 27.
</P>
<P>
The bank is to provide loans in renminbi to three or four
Japanese-funded firms which have intimate trade relations with
Chinese firms this month, said Kiyoshige Akamatsu, president of
the IBJ Shanghai Branch.
</P>
<P>
Transactions in renminbi only account for one or two percent of
the branch's total transactions. But the president predicted such
ratio will rise to 10 percent in the near future.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Michael Johnson may drop out of
the World Athletics Championships in August because of a pulled
left quadriceps suffered in his 150m showdown against Donovan
Bailey.
</P>
<P>
"Michael couldn't bend his leg (Monday) and could be out for
two weeks to a month," said Clyde Hart, Johnson's coach.
</P>
<P>
If Johnson, the reigning Olympic 200m and 400m champion, is out
for that long it would deny him a chance to compete next week at
the US athletics championships in Indianapolis, the US qualifying
meet for the world championships at Athens.
</P>
<P>
Johnson suffered the injury in Sunday's "world's fastest man"
race against Canada's Donovan Bailey in Toronto. Bailey won in
14.99 seconds as Johnson pulled up about halfway into the showdown
with an injury.

<HEADLINE> Ireland's Main Opposition Party Supports EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Ireland's main opposition Fianna
Fail party, which is tipped to win the Irish general election to
be held on Friday, has expressed its firm commitment to joining
the European Monetary Union (EMU) on January 1 1999, press reports
from Dublin said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Dublin today, Fianna Fail
leader Bertie Ahern said: "The principle of joining EMU in the
first wave should not, I believe, be an issue. If we fulfill the
Maastricht criteria, which we do, we are legally committed to
becoming members."
</P>
<P>
"It would send very wrong signals to Europe, and would suggest
that we were to all intents and purposes an economic satellite of
Britain if we were to seek to renege on our commitment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on warnings by some economists that joining EMU
would be dangerous for Ireland's economy if Britain stayed out,
Ahern stressed that Ireland should be in the first wave whatever
Britain did.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition leader noted that there are strong
signs that Britain would join the single European currency.
</P>
<P>
"It is reasonably clear that the new British government are
preparing the ground for participation in EMU. Whether to begin
with or later is not yet clear," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the EMU timetable, Ahern expressed his convictions that the
EMU would go ahead on schedule, despite a landslide victory for
the socialist party in France's elections and a row between the
German government and Bundesbank over the revaluation of gold
reserves.
</P>
<P>
"There is in Europe a huge political commitment to EMU. I think
it is a mistake to read recent political upheavals and controversy
in France and Germany as meaning that it could all be about to
unravel," he added.

<P>
NEW YORK, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Leading Economic Indicators in
April decreased by 0.1 percent to 103.5, according to a
preliminary estimates by the New York-based Conference Board
today.
</P>
<P>
The leading index increased 0.2 percent in March, an upward
revision and highest in history. It increased 0.5 percent in
February, the research group said. During the six-month period
through April, eight of the ten leading economic indicators
advanced.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board's calculations show that six of the ten
leading economic indicators fell in April. The most significant
decrease is the average weekly initial claims for state
unemployment insurance.
</P>
<P>
The index is the key element in an analytic system designed to
signal peaks and troughs in the business cycle.
</P>
<P>
The data of April reinforced hopes that economic growth will be
modest enough to keep inflationary pressures tame without another
boost in interest rates by the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
Bonds and other fixed-income investments are more appealing
when there's little threat of rapid inflation.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Administration Criticized on Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. administration's delay
in expanding free trade in Latin America was attacked today by
both the Republican and Democratic parties in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
During a hearing of the Senate Finance Committee, Democrats and
Republicans complained that the administration's delay was costing
American companies and workers who were losing out in the battle
to expand markets in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
William Roth, chairman of the committee, said he was
disappointed with President Bill Clinton's decision to wait until
September to ask Congress for the authority he needs to negotiate
to expand the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
</P>
<P>
"I think that by delaying action until the fall, the president
runs the risk that we will not be able to complete `fast track'
this year or next," said Roth.
</P>
<P>
The fast-track authority legislation bars congressional
amendments to any trade agreements the administration negotiates.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has said he wants the authority to negotiate labor and
environmental agreements as part of any overall free trade deals,
but Republicans are opposed.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans argue that issues like labor and environment
are not directly related to trade and should not be part of
fast-track legislation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the hearing, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky said that the delay had been a unanimous
recommendation from the Cabinet to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
She added that the administration was likely to seek broad
fast-track authority that would allow negotiations to go forward
with a number of countries over free trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and 33 other Western Hemisphere leaders in 1994 set
2005 as a target date for creating a hemisphere-wide free trade
area.
</P>
<P>
Barshefsky also told the senators that in addition to expanding
free trade, the administration would also seek negotiating
authority for new global trade deals in such areas as lowering
barriers to U.S. farm products.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Gov't, Bundesbank Strike Compromise on Gold Revaluation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The German government today struck a
compromise deal with the central bank over its controversial plan
to revalue the bank's gold reserves.
</P>
<P>
The government and the central bank, known as the Bundesbank,
agreed Tuesday to revalue the bank's gold reserves closer to the
market price this year but delay the transfer of the surplus gained
from the move to the government until 1998 instead of 1997 as
initially planned.
</P>
<P>
The deal was struck by Finance Minister Theo Waigel and
Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer at a meeting in Bonn. Waigel
is due to formally announce the agreement in a speech to the
parliament on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to German media, the government is discussing
privatizations and more modest tax cuts as alternative measures to
plug an expected huge budget gap in order to enable Germany to
qualify for the planned single European currency in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Waigel reportedly wants to raise petrol taxes and delay cutting
an income tax surcharge to help raise funds.
</P>
<P>
But this is rejected by the Free Democratic Party (FDP), the
junior partner in Bonn's ruling coalition. Instead of tax rises,
the FDP wants to speech up privatization of states assets,
including German Lufthansa Airlines and the Deutsche Telecom
telephone company.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the German ruling coalition failed again to resolve
their internal dispute over the issue during a second round of
negotiations.

<P>
ATHENS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
will visit Greece for talks with Prime Minister Costas Simitis to
coordinate their policies before the start of direct talks between
the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities.
</P>
<P>
According to the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) today,
the exact date for the president's visit had not yet been set.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was reportedly necessitated within the framework of
the preparations of the Greek-Cyprus side.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
"invaded" and occupied the northern third of the island in
response to a coup in Nicosia engineered by the junta then ruling
Greece.

<P>
The Turkish-Cypriot declared a breakaway state in 1983 but it
is recognized only by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Britain, Ireland Condition IRA Peace Talk with Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Britain and Ireland said today IRA's
political wing Sinn Fein would not be allowed to the multi-party
peace talks unless IRA called a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
An aide to Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring told reporters in
Belfast that the two governments' patience was also running out.
</P>
<P>
"The patience of the two governments must not be presumed to be
inexhaustible," local reports quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The multi-party talks on Northern Ireland conflict resumed in
Belfast today after being adjourned three months ago for a British
general election that was held on May 1.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein was barred from attending the peace talks because the
outlawed IRA guerrillas has rejected to call a new cease-fire after
it quit a truce in February, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, Mo Mowlam, also showed
signs of impatience as she urged political leaders to agree on
disarming guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
"If Sinn Fein want to join the talks, there must be an
unequivocal restoration of the IRA ceasefire in words and
deeds...The ball is in their court," she said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
However, talks chairman George Mitchell, a former U.S. senator,
expressed optimism over the new round after talks with British
Prime Minister Tony Blair on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that an opportunity exists to move forward in the
process and we hope very much that there will be substantive
progress in these talks in the near future," Mitchell told
reporters as the talks got under way.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Cautious on NATO's Membership of Balkan Nation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. has not decided whether
to support the membership of the Balkan nation of Slovenia in the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen said today.
</P>
<P>
Prior to meeting with his Slovenian counterpart Tit Turnsek at
the Pentagon, Cohen said: "There has been no decision yet in terms
of who will be recommended for inclusion in the first round."
</P>
<P>
"That's something the president is taking under advisement," he
said, adding that no decision would be made before leaders of the
16-member alliance meet on July 8-9 in Madrid, Spain.
</P>
<P>
Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Romania and Slovenia are
considered the front-runners to win membership invitations during
the first wave of NATO's expansion.
</P>
<P>
France, Italy and other southern European members of the alliance are
lobbying hard for Romania and Slovenia. But Washington
apparently favors only three in the first group.
</P>
<P>
However, Cohen added that Slovenia a former Yugoslav republic,
"has a very good record and certainly is under consideration" for
membership, but adding that "one cannot make any prediction at
this point."
</P>
<P>
Without giving details, Turnsek said he hoped his meeting with
Cohen would clarify some issues related to his country's bid for
NATO membership.
</P>
<P>
He noted that if Slovenia were not included in the first wave
of NATO's enlargement, Slovenia "will have to rethink the
strategy", but will continue to pursue a full NATO membership.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Tuesday that it decided to support renewal of the U.N.
oil-for-food deal for Iraq after the agreement expires by June 7.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary (of State Madeleine Albright) has decided that
the United States will support the renewal of U.N. resolution 986
and that is the oil for food deal," State Department spokesman
Nicholas Burns told reporters.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan on Monday recommended the
renewal of the deal on the same terms: allowing Iraq to sell up to
$2 billion worth oil for six months and use use the money to buy
food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
Most members of the U.N. Security Council had reportedly
expressed their approval of the renewal, but the United States has
not made the decision until now.
</P>
<P>
Burns said the United States had agreed to renew the deal
because the "agreement benefits the people of Iraq,... It does not
benefit in any way the government of Iraq."

<HEADLINE> Britain Outlows Two Guerrilla Groups in N.Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Britain banned today two Northern
Ireland guerrilla groups which were responsible for violence over
the past year.
</P>
<P>
Mo Mowlam, Secretary of State for the province, had announced
earlier in the day that the pro-British Loyalist Volunteer Force
(LVF) and the pro-Irish Continuity Army Council (CAC) "will be
proscribed from midnight tonight (Tuesday)," according to a
government statement.
</P>
<P>
The ban was implemented in line with Northern Ireland's
Emergency Provisions Act which permits Mowlam to make an Order if
she believed an organization was concerned in terrorism or
promoting it.
</P>
<P>
The LVF split from Northern Ireland's mainstream Loyalist
movement, which is officially maintaining a ceasefire in its
campaign to maintain British rule of the province.
</P>
<P>
The CAC is a shadowy republican splinter group which was
thought responsible for an attempted car bomb in Belfast three
weeks ago and an attack on a country hotel in July last year.
</P>
<P>
Britain has already banned a number of terrorist groups in
Northern Ireland, including Irish Republican Army (IRA) which
launched military campaign against the rule of Britain on Northern
Ireland over the past 28 years, with some 3,200 people killed.
</P>
<P>
IRA was barred from attending a multi-party peace talks on the
Northern Ireland conflict which were resumed today because it
refuses to reach a ceasefire with government.

LONDON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Chancellor, Gordon Brown will
deliver his first Budget on July 2, a Wednesday, instead of the
more traditional Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came in a written parliamentary answer as
evidence of strong manufacturing activity increased speculation
that the Bank of England may raise interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Chancellor confirmed that the Budget will be on July 2
because Prime Minister Tony Blair will be in China on July 1.
</P>
<P>
The Budget is expected to introduce tighter fiscal policy to
take some of the heat out of the economy.
</P>
<P>
But City economists said survey evidence of the strength of
manufacturing output increased the likelihood that the Bank will
increase rates before the Budget.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing activity last month was at its highest level
since April 1995 according to a survey released yesterday by the
Chartered Institute for Purchasing and Supply.
</P>
<P>
Strong domestic demand is continuing to insulate manufacturers
from the soaring pound which is affecting exports badly.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Firms Encouraged to Set Up Businesses in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Embassy in Nigeria said
today the Chinese government encourages its companies to
establish businesses in the African country.
</P>
<P>
This is in line with China's policy toward promoting economic and
trade relations with foreign countries on the basis of equity and
mutual benefit, an embassy official in the commercial counselor's
office told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Further discussions are needed in this regard between the two
countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
The envoy made the remarks while asked to confirm a News Agency of
Nigeria (NAN) report which said Nigeria has reached broad agreements
with China for establishing processing companies in the Calabar Export
Processing Zone in the east of the country.
</P>
<P>
The NAN report quoted Nigerian Ambassador to China Zubairu Kazaure
as saying that this was one of the agreements with Chinese officials
during last month's visit of Chinese Premier Li Peng to the country.
</P>
<P>
The products of the proposed processing companies would be
re-exported to China to reduce the trade imbalance between both
countries, the Nigerian envoy said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, bilateral trade stood at 177 million U.S. dollars
last year, with Chinese exports to Nigeria amounting to 150 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Cautioning against an obsession to eliminate the imbalance, Kazaure
said China enjoyed trade surplus with many countries, which founds
Chinese products affordable.
</P>
<P>
He therefore advised Nigerian enterpreneurs to explore the
possibility of joint ventures with Chinese companies for the
processing of locally available products that could be exported to
China.
</P>
<P>
Kazaure identified cashew nuts, timber and timber products as well
as petroleum products as attractive in China, adding that Nigerians
should, however, be prepared for a highly competitive Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Chinese companies are now engaged in railway rehabilitation, harbor
dredging and other projects in Nigeria. A textile joint venture has
been put into trial operation in the Calabar Export Processing Zone.
</P>
<P>
China provided to Nigeria last April four locomotives as the first
group of 50 of them listed in the railway project contract. But some
people in Nigeria are reportedly doubtful that the locomotives are
old.
</P>
<P>
Kazaure accused these unnamed people who were determined to realise
their private interests of being responsible for the rumours.
</P>
<P>
"I have seen the locomotives and there is nothing wrong with them,"
he told the Nigerian official news agency.

<HEADLINE> UN Recommands Iraqi Oil Deal for Another Six Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Kofi
Annan today recommended a six-month renewal of the "oil-for-food"
deal for Iraq, UN spokesman Fred Eckhard announced.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Security Council, Annan said the deal, which
was authorized by the Security Council in its resolution 986 and
would expire on June 7, was unique among all humanitarian
assistance operations undertaken by the United Nations to mitigate
some of the negative effects of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Annan said in the light of the experience gained in the
implementation of the program in the past six months and the
continuing humanitarian crisis in Iraq, the deal should be
extended.
</P>
<P>
The current deal allows Iraq to export 2 billion U.S. dollars
worth of oil over six months to buy food and medicine for its
people suffering from long time sanctions. UN imposed strict
economic sanctions on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait in August
1990.

<HEADLINE> Household Size Varies Greatly Among Countries, UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Average household size
ranged from 7.0 persons in Algeria to 2.1 persons in Sweden,
according to a UN yearbook published today.
</P>
<P>
The Demographic Yearbook 1995 features latest statistics and
indicators on household, family characteristics, marriage and
divorce from 111 countries and areas.
</P>
<P>
Among the 25 largest countries in the world, the biggest
average household size was in India, 5.5 persons per household,
and the smallest was in the United States, the Russian Federation
and France, which had 2.6 per household. China, which has a
population of 1.13 billion or one-fifth in the world, reported 4
persons per household.
</P>
<P>
Four other countries among the 25 largest ones reported an
average of 5 or more persons per household -- Philippines, 5.3;
Iran, 5.2; Mexico, 5.0; and Turkey 5.0. They are followed by Egypt
4.9; Viet Nam, 4.8; Indonesia, 4.5; and Brazil, 4.2.
</P>
<P>
Among the 25 African countries and areas covered by the book,
11 countries reported average household size of at least 5
persons, 12 had average household size of 4-5 persons; only 2
areas, namely Reunion and St. Helena, registered average household
size of less than 4 persons.
</P>
<P>
In North America, average household size of 5 or more was only
in Mexico; Colombia was the only country with average household
size of 5 persons or more in South Africa. In Asia 11 countries
reported an average size of 5 persons or more. In Europe, the
largest average household size was the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia with 3.8 persons per household. In Oceania, average
household size ranged from 2.8 in New Zealand to 6.5 in the
Solomon Islands.

<HEADLINE> Surging Economy Bypasses Black People in the US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy which is
expanding into seventh year is supposed to carry with it all types
of people, but low-skilled black people haven't quite caught the
wave.
</P>
<P>
Though the latest U.S. economic expansion has helped both
blacks and whites, it hasn't done much to narrow the gap between
them. Black workers are making just 76.5 percent of what white
workers make per week now, down from the 78 percent they made in
1990, according to The Wall Street Journal today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that black males in particular are losing
ground. The earning gap between black male college and high-school
graduates has widened four times as much since 1990, as has the
gap between their white counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment is running at 3.5 percent among college-educated
black men and 9.5 percent among black high-school grads. But
comparable figures for white college and high-school grads: 2.1
percent and 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The main reason by which blacks in the U.S. haven't benefit
much from the surging economy is the fact that small percentage of
them received high education. Only about 14 percent blacks
attended college. It left them unflexible in the changing economy.

<P>
LONDON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- British High Court granted IRA bomb
suspect Roisin McAliskey a bail today after she gave birth to a
baby in a London hospital last week.
</P>
<P>
The court rule allowed 25-year-old McAliskey and her newborn
daughter Loinnir to move to a specialist mother and baby unit
instead of going to prison, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
McAliskey had been held in Britain's high security Holloway
prison since last year pending extradition to Germany for
questioning about an Irish Republican Army mortar attack at a
British army base in Osnabrueck.
</P>
<P>
Her mother Bernadette Mcaliskey said last week that security
officers even accompanied her daughter to ante-natal classes in
prison where the most intimate issues were being discussed.
</P>
<P>
"There is not one single supportable shred of evidence to
indicate that she has the most minimal knowledge of that offence,"
the mother said of accusations that her daughter was involved in
the Osnabrueck bombing last June.
</P>
<P>
McAliskey was granted bail as multi-party peace talks on
Northern Ireland resumed in Belfast. Sinn Fein, the IRA's
political wing, remains excluded from the talks until the IRA
declares a credible ceasefire.
