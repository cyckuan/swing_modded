L.A. CLOSES DEAL WITH SHAW (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _Kevin Malone didn't get his first choice of
managers when Felipe Alou decided to stay with the Expos, but the
Los Angeles Dodgers' new general manager came through in a big way
by convincing closer Jeff Shaw to remain in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw agreed Wednesday morning to restructure his contract and
play with the Dodgers through at least 2001. Shaw was to make $2.8
million per year for the next three years but will instead be paid
a little more than $5 million per season through 2001 with a club
option for 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Had a deal not been reached by midnight, Shaw would have had the
right to demand a trade because he was a player with at least five
years of major-league experience traded during a multiyear contract
when the Dodgers acquired him from the Reds last July 4 for Paul
Konerko and Dennis Reyes. Shaw could have become a free agent had
the Dodgers not traded him by next spring.
</P>
<P>
   But that will not happen now because Malone was able to lure
Shaw to Los Angeles and away from his home state of Ohio, something
that didn't seem possible months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very tough decision,'' Shaw said during a conference
call Wednesday afternoon. ``We're small-town people. I really
enjoyed playing in Cincinnati. But to ask for a trade from the
Dodgers, being thrown out to wherever, was kind of scary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very crucial that Kevin came to me,'' Shaw continued.
``Kevin knows the type of person I am. During the whole
negotiation, he was straightforward and honest. He didn't try to
slide anything past me.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's biggest concern was moving his family from their home in
Washington Court House, Ohio, to Los Angeles. Shaw and his wife
Julie have two children, ages 7 and 4, and a third due in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the major discussion points we had was what L.A. has to
offer,'' Malone said. ``I think it's the greatest city in the
world. It's one of the most diverse cities in the world. It wasn't
really a sales job, I was just presenting the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's agent Joe Bick said a recent meeting Shaw and his wife,
Julie, had with Malone was key in his staying with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The critical turning point in Jeff's feelings came three weeks
ago,'' Bick said. ``Myself, Jeff, his wife, Julie, and Kevin had
dinner in Columbus. I think it was the message Kevin sent that
night, and the way he went about sending it. He was laid back and
there was no force-it-down-your-throat approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``He answered the concerns Jeff had and it changed the direction
they were going. Before then, Jeff was set on demanding a trade.
But the next day Jeff and I played golf and he said, `Let's see if
we can get it done.'''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw, 32, was 3-8 with a 2.12 ERA and 48 saves with the Reds and
Dodgers last season, 25 of his saves coming for L.A. He had 42
saves for the Reds in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``As everyone recognizes, Jeff Shaw has distinguished himself
the last few years as one of baseball's best closers,'' Malone
said. ``We're happy to have him, not only as a pitcher but because
of other things, like his commitment to family, commitment to
success and to the Dodgers organization. With that said, he's a
positive influence in attracting other top-notch available
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Those other ``top-notch'' players include free-agent pitchers
Randy Johnson and Kevin Brown, center fielder Bernie Williams and
first baseman Mo Vaughn. Malone said the Dodgers plan to look at
all of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plan is to be in the race and be involved in the
process,'' Malone said.

EDITORIAL: LESSONS FROM ELECTION DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Nov. 5:
</P>
<P>
   It was an Election Day that had a bit of everything. Senate
bullies like Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., and Lauch Faircloth,
R-N.C., were humbled. Earnestness triumphed in forms ranging from
bland (George Pataki) to the slightly nerdy (Russell Feingold).
Some sons (Skip Humphrey) were setting, but some (see Bush, George
W., and Bush, Jeb) were rising. A party long regarded as being on
life support (the Democrats) came tap-dancing out of intensive
care. A nation that seems never to weary of seeing Newt Gingrich
get his comeuppance watched him pile chips on the impeachment card
and then let Hillary Rodham Clinton sweep them off the table.
</P>
<P>
   The question, of course, is what lessons to draw from this
variegated show so full of suspense, upsets and reversals of party
fortune. That is no simple matter, for a midterm election lacks the
focusing prism of a presidential contest. This was an election that
touched on power alignments between and within the parties, on
voter attitudes, on candidates for the new millennium, on campaign
finance and, of course, on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Like all midterm elections, this one occurred under the shadow
of its most prominent non-candidate. The paradox of Bill Clinton's
personal flaws and political resilience may never be fully
explained, but this campaign season documents it anew. Although
some Democrats shunned him, Clinton made 130 appearances, and Mrs.
Clinton, often claiming the more high-profile spots, made about
100. A Democratic disaster would have made them pariahs within
their own party. Now they emerge with as much clout as could be
summoned for a White House with such a troubled history.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich is thinking wishfully when he insists there is no
message about impeachment to be gleaned from the GOP's loss of five
House seats and key Senate races. The House results, in particular,
suggest that the public has done a sophisticated job of balancing
its disapproval of Clinton as a person and its desire for
continuity and a Congress that works. By reducing the Republican
majority in the House, the voters gave Clinton the leverage to shop
for a censure deal. The chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Henry
Hyde, may be in a stronger position to stand up to Gingrich now and
also to demand that Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, deliver
all the evidence he plans to release once the hearings resume.
Starr, for his part, would be deeply foolish not to see the public
impatience expressed by the election results.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde has said that the outcome of the impeachment process must
be backed by a public majority. The overall message of this
election and the accompanying polls is that a two-thirds majority
has already congealed. It wants a formal condemnation of Clinton
for lying under oath and demeaning his office. But it also wants
him to continue in office and for the Republican Congress to engage
him on issues that stirred the voters.
</P>
<P>
   The Candidates
</P>
<P>
   For conservatives, this election may come to be regarded as a
stylistic watershed. The generation of ``Contract With America''
warriors who came roaring into power four years ago is already
going out of fashion. The new trend is on the warm side of mellow.
The public rewarded Republicans who were in touch with their inner
environmentalist, and shunned those who crusaded for anything more
disruptive than putting computers in the classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Former Rep. Robert Dornan of California, a ripsaw reactionary,
was trounced in a comeback bid. Gov. Fob James of Alabama showed
that even in the Bible Belt it is possible to thump the Good Book
too hard. After losing the Florida governorship four years ago as
an ideological conservative, Jeb Bush won this time by defending
battered women and promising to restore ``compassion'' to welfare
services for children.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb's brother George W. pioneered this sort of politics in
Texas, where he won re-election as governor and the status of
undeclared presidential front-runner. In short, these Bushes ran
full bore on the ``kinder and gentler'' theme that their father
talked about in his 1988 acceptance speech, but never pursued
consistently.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that voters are rewarding candidates who display good
manners and an ability to play well with others does not explain
Minnesota, where the electorate rejected the sons of Walter
Mondale, Orville Freeman and Hubert Humphrey and settled on Jesse
(the Body) Ventura, a former professional wrestler. Gov.-elect
Ventura does, however, come from a profession where sudden
transformations from villain to hero are an everyday occurrence. He
too may have no trouble moving from body slams to a thousand points
of light.
</P>
<P>
   The Voters
</P>
<P>
   In many recent elections the public, pollsters and commentators
have gotten used to outcomes determined by the militant Republican
core and by the wedge issues of the Christian right. Something
different happened on Tuesday. Some key races were swung by
moderate women and traditional Democratic minority groups and by
middle-income suburban voters who had been behavioral Republicans.
This emergent coalition may be impermanent, but it overwhelmed the
faction animated by school prayer and flag-burning.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, according to Bill Schneider of CNN, a quarter of the
Democratic vote came from those he called the ``new rich.'' These
are people making over $50,000 a year. In all likelihood, the
Republicans had pulled them in the past with economic issues. This
year two-thirds of them opposed impeachment, liked Mrs. Clinton and
disliked Gingrich, and they moved into the Democratic column. The
Republicans, always weak with women, remained tied to the abortion
issue. This election showed that moderate swing voters consider
pro-choice the mainstream stance. They soundly rejected late-term
abortion bans in Washington and Colorado. In California's
gubernatorial race, the Republicans' Dan Lungren lost in large part
because he is staunchly opposed to abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans who flourished, such as Governor Pataki of New
York and Gov. John Rowland of Connecticut, positioned themselves as
pro-business politicians who stand apart from GOP orthodoxy on
abortion and other social issues. That stance pleased most voters,
including women, in the center, and also made it harder for their
Democratic opponents to label them part of the Republican fringe.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Leadership
</P>
<P>
   With the public, sometimes you can spin away a disaster and
sometimes you cannot. But it is the Republican politicians whom
Newt Gingrich and Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., have to worry about. On
Wednesday they were getting the first whiff of mutiny from the
Republican congressional bunkers. The back-benchers are now looking
on some of their leaders as losers and wondering if they have
misread the public mood.
</P>
<P>
   At bottom, the voters refused to fatten the Republican
majorities of a do-nothing Congress. Gingrich; the majority leader,
Dick Armey of Texas; the majority whip, Tom DeLay of Texas, and
Rep. John Boehner of Ohio marched their stalwart Contract
conservatives into smaller and smaller circles, alienating the
voter-rich political middle.
</P>
<P>
   From shutting down the government in 1995 to attaching abortion
caveats to U.N. money, this group moved toward the fringe. Issues
like patients' rights, better public education and secure Social
Security were lost in their small-bore debates. Anti-gay rhetoric
and anti-Clinton advertising at the end of the campaign left the
impression that only white, straight Christians need apply for GOP
membership. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, acknowledged Tuesday that to
flourish, his party now had to ``get off its dime'' and stop
ignoring women, minorities and Hispanics. But Gingrich has a more
immediate image problem within his own party. He marched into the
speakership like T. Rex. He cannot now afford to be seen as Wiley
E. Coyote.
</P>
<P>
   The Money
</P>
<P>
   We are always shopping for encouraging news about campaign
finance reform. Here is some. In Wisconsin, Democratic Sen. Russell
Feingold was re-elected despite his refusal to let his own allies
flood Wisconsin with television ads financed by tainted soft money.
Less noticed was the impressive victory of initiatives in Arizona
and Massachusetts creating a system in which candidates who agree
to limit campaign donations and spending receive public financing
for their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The shrinkage of the Republican majority in the House means that
supporters of the Shays-Meehan soft-money ban will probably have
more backing than ever in the next year. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the
minority leader, should make its passage one of the Democrats'
highest priorities. In the Senate, Lott would be wise to regard
this year as a learning experience for a relatively new majority
leader. The Republicans raised more soft money than the Democrats,
and then handed the spending of it to Sen. Mitch McConnell of
Kentucky, who never met a vendetta he didn't like. He withheld the
money from a fellow Republican, Rep. Linda Smith, in the state of
Washington, where she lost a Senate race to the incumbent, Patty
Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato's defeat removes one of Capitol Hill's most
devoted collectors of special-interest money and replaces him with
Democrat Charles Schumer. New York's new senator has the potential
not only to vote for reform but to lead the fight in enacting it.
There is plenty to reform.
</P>
<P>
   According to Common Cause, the national parties raised $162
million in soft money. That is more than double the sum of four
years ago, and it suggests that in the next election the parties
could be heading toward a new record of $500 million in soft money
if there is no reform to head them off.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of money represents a continuing threat to the
integrity of American elections and casts a pall over everyone's
enjoyment of the festival of democracy. For even though many good
candidates and causes prevailed on Tuesday and the nation may have
moved a significant step toward resolving the Clinton scandals and
the impeachment crisis, the fact remains that only 37 percent of
eligible voters took part in the election. We have to believe that
more voters would participate if they saw the parties as unbought
and corruption-free. The progressive shift in this Congress'
membership and the damage to the GOP leadership moves the nation a
tiny but important step toward an Election Day that will be as
clean as it is lively.

BUSY WEEK FOR THE MAN BEHIND THE RUNWAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn.)  (lb) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kevin Krier produces fashion shows for a living, so
on Wednesday, in the middle of Fashion Week in New York, he was up
at 4:30 a.m. for an 11 a.m. show he was doing for Elizabeth
Fillmore, a young designer, at Monzu, the restaurant in SoHo. He
arrived at 6. There was a lot to do: Check the sound, check the
seating, check the food, rehearse the models _ i.e., ``the girls.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, Elizabeth's girls are about something healthy,'' said
Krier, who speaks fluent New York fashion dialect and is very
entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   Here he is describing the hair styles and makeup he helped
choose for Elizabeth's girls in the show: ``There's a cheek, so the
girl looks healthy. There's a smear of gel over the lip. It's not a
pronounced lip. And then the hair is very textured. It sort of
looks like when a woman wakes up in the morning and takes her hands
and runs them through her hair, and then she's done for the day.
She can go conquer the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes. Although perhaps not everyone can pull that off.
</P>
<P>
   Krier would have none of it. ``Get a good haircut and you can
all do it,'' he said. He glanced over at one of his vice
presidents, Deborah Hughes. ``Look at Deborah there. Now, beautiful
girl, right?'' Right. Ms. Hughes came over, confirmed cheerfully
that she had not combed her hair, then walked away.
</P>
<P>
   Krier chose the spot for the show not least because it was only
blocks from Ralph Lauren's 10 a.m. show, meaning Ms. Fillmore might
benefit from Lauren's crowds in the neighborhood. He also picked
the Sicilian blood orange iced tea and salmon bruschetta that would
be served to showgoers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll just come from Ralph and it's like that 11 o'clock
thing where you like a something,'' Krier said.
</P>
<P>
   The music was his, too: ``Loungy cornball kind of music'' to set
the pre-show mood; Fat Boy Slim once things get under way. He never
uses classical. ``Classical music can be off-putting to your core
audience,'' he said. ``I think there's a coolness issue that's not
being met. It's not the kind of music you can walk to.''
</P>
<P>
   Krier also does the seating, which means he has to decide which
high-powered and self-important fashion editors, retailers and
movie stars sit in the front row. ``Which is always a pleasure,''
he said, sarcastically. ``As I've often said, I'd rather clean the
bathrooms at Yankee Stadium than do the seating.''
</P>
<P>
   Directing the models is more amusing. He tells the girls before
they walk down the runway that ``you're sexy, but think of your
sexiness inside.'' In other words, he said, ``you're a predator,
but you're an internal predator.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds good. What does it mean? ``We're all sort of out there,
getting it,'' he said. ``I can have it, it's good, I can have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Krier, 43 _ ``I'm telling you the truth, I usually lie'' _ is
one of the biggest producers in fashion. He does some 70 shows a
year, following the fashion seasons from London to Milan to Paris
to New York and back. (A big show can cost $400,000 in New York, $1
million in Europe. The biggest expense is models, who can make
$20,000 per show.)
</P>
<P>
   Krier does all of Gucci's shows worldwide, and at one time or
another has produced for Giorgio Armani, Hugo Boss and Tommy
Hilfiger. This week in New York he also did shows for Carolina
Herrera, BCBG and Linda Allard for Ellen Tracy. On Thursday he is
producing a show for Tuleh, a young design team.
</P>
<P>
   He started producing fashion shows in New York in 1989. He made
his mark a year later when he produced the first show by Todd
Oldham, the designer who became known for his rock 'n' roll,
celebrity-stuffed blasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing we knew how to do at that point was make
clothes, and I suppose some people even thought that was up for
debate,'' said Oldham, who has closed his wholesale collection
business and did not show in New York this season. But he will
continue working with Krier on projects. He said that while Krier
``is fueled by nervous energy,'' he ``doesn't spin out of
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Krier grew up in Hastings, Minn., which he said had a population
at the time of 10,581. His father was a Goodyear salesman in nearby
St. Paul. Krier went to Macalester College and worked in community
theater. He arrived in New York in 1979 and got a job selling shoes
at the old Susan Bennis/Warren Edwards store, where he became
starstruck when the actor Richard Harris was his first customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He walked in singing `What Do the Simple Folk Do,''' said
Krier, referring to Harris' song as King Arthur in the film version
of ``Camelot.'' ``I'm not making this up.'' The first week Diana
Ross and Jacqueline Onassis stopped in, too. ``My phone bill to
call home and tell my friends was more than I made that week,''
Krier said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Krier slid into freelance work in fashion shows, which he
saw as great dramas. ``I love what I do,'' he said. ``I get to
create this theater 60, 70 times a year. It's a wonderful place to
be. It makes the work of the designer come alive.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the director had 30 people working for him, but
the show started at 11:30 a.m., a half-hour late. Right on time for
fashion. Has Krier ever started promptly?
</P>
<P>
   ``Never,'' he said. ``Close. I mean, we've been really close.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest, he said, was an hour. ``And it feels like each
minute of that hour, someone's taking another hair out of my
head.''

HARD FEELINGS FROM SOFTER TIMES 
WHEN YOU'RE IN, ALL YOUR STUFF IS IN 
MYSTICAL MELANGE 
DOUBLE SHORTAGE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JAMES BARRON with KIMBERLY STEVENS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joe Klein _ who was unmasked as the author of the
best-selling campaign novel ``Primary Colors'' in 1996, when he was
a columnist for Newsweek magazine _ had words with Susan Fraker
after the funeral of her husband, Maynard Parker, the editor of
Newsweek. He died of leukemia last month.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fraker said she told Klein that he should have ``apologized
to Maynard for all the pain he caused during the `Primary Colors'
episode.''' ( Klein denied that he had written the novel until a
handwriting expert said that notes on one copy of the manuscript
matched Klein's slightly slanted script.)
</P>
<P>
   ``He came through the receiving line,'' Ms. Fraker said of
Klein, ``and I shook hands with him. I said, `Joe, you have to say
you're sorry,' and he said, `Well, I am sorry,' and I said, `No,
not sorry that he died, sorry for all the pain you caused two years
ago.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even remember what the reply was, but it ended with,
`Well, we'll talk about that later.' I really loved my husband.
Maynard had a big heart and he forgave Joe a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached Wednesday at The New Yorker magazine, where he now
works, Klein said: ``That is private. I'm not going to talk about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   When You're In, All Your Stuff Is In
</P>
<P>
   Even stage costumes by Mary McFadden sell. Several of the 21
items that she designed for a recent Brooklyn Academy of Music
production have changed hands for five-figure prices.
</P>
<P>
   At least two were quickly put to quite a different use: They
made the rounds of Manhattan Halloween parties last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea that people would be enamored by these
costumes,'' she said about the outfits she modeled on garments worn
in ancient Greece. Or that people would wear them for Halloween.
But there she was, wearing a mask from ``The World Mysteries: The
Mysteries of Eleusis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite heavy, about three pounds, and has a lot of spikes
on it, so you can definitely impale someone,'' Ms. McFadden said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason Miss McFadden did the costumes was that the
production's director was her husband, Vasilios Calitsis. It was
the first time she had designed for him, and there was no mystery
to how they collaborated. ``There was never any discussion about
the clothes,'' she said. ``I put them on the models, I mean the
actresses, and we had one dress rehearsal. That was it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mystical Melange
</P>
<P>
   Deepak Chopra, the spiritual writer and celebrity guru, sank
into a couch at a party at Zona Home on Greene Street on Tuesday
night and explained how he put together a compact disk of music
inspired by the love poems of the 13th-century mystic Rumi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Madonna was staying at our house for the weekend and she
leafed through my Rumi manuscripts and was inspired,'' he said.
``She told me she thought they should be put to music.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he called Rosa Parks, the civil rights figure, and asked if
she knew who Rumi was. ``She surprised me,'' he said. `` `Oh Yeah,
of course. He writes about love and God.' I couldn't believe it.
She was the second person to sign on.''
</P>
<P>
   Double Shortage
</P>
<P>
   First he pulled the plug on the money for his wife's maverick
campaign for governor. Then Wednesday, the day after Betsey
McCaughey Ross lost, her husband, Wilbur L. Ross Jr., said that he
was pulling the plug on their marriage. ``It's always a shame when
things don't work out in a marriage,'' he said in a statement,
confirming a report in The New York Post that said he planned to
file divorce papers. He added, ``I continue to hold Betsy in high
regard.'' Calls to Ms. McCaughey Ross were not returned.

NATIONAL SHOW THRIVES WITH GARDEN AS SETTING 
</HEADLINE>

 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At the turn of the century, the National Horse Show
survived the upstaging of the horse by the automobile, and in 1915
the show survived a wink at tradition when Eleanora Sears became
the first woman to shelve her sidesaddle and ride astride like a
man.
</P>
<P>
   Now it appears that the National, in fiscal danger for the last
decade, has survived a three-year probation at Madison Square
Garden and will ride safely into the millennium instead of
extinction.
</P>
<P>
   The 115th rendition of the National Horse Show, which opens on
Thursday at the Garden and culminates Sunday with the $50,000
Budweiser Grand Prix, has finally found a horse-friendly
environment in the third and final season of its reunion contract
with the Garden, the show's main stomping ground for all but 7 of
its 115 years.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last year, the 200 horses taking up temporary stall space
in the arena's underbelly will not have to be evicted in a rush to
accommodate the Knicks. Thanks to the National Basketball
Association lockout, the horse show returned to its traditional
Sunday afternoon finale.
</P>
<P>
   And the installation of the show ring's dirt foundation, a
$60,000 concoction, was a snap. To remove the potential for tainted
ice after the show leaves town, the Garden melted away the New York
Rangers' workplace on Wednesday night rather than attempt the
tricky business of preserving it beneath a costly shield of
insulation.
</P>
<P>
   This year, when the show's only competition is an unfortunate
calendar collision with its Canadian counterpart, Toronto's Royal
Agricultural Winter Festival, even the horses may notice an
upgrade: the flowers framing the show ring will be fresh _ edible!
_ instead of fake.
</P>
<P>
   The National, which costs some $2 million to stage, lost money
in its first year back in Manhattan in 1996 after a failed
seven-year experiment at the Meadowlands in New Jersey, but nearly
broke even in 1997. Alan Balch, the show's president, is optimistic
that the National's lease will be renewed by the Garden into the
next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're emerging from the twilight zone and we're managing to
stay afloat,'' Balch said. ``I'm not satisfied with the show's
evolution. We've got to come up with a new approach on the
jumpers.''
</P>
<P>
   The old approaches are not working: the National's decision to
jettison the Puissance event underlines that reality. Even though
the Puissance, the height-defying class where horses tackled a
faux-stone wall that mushroomed to more than seven feet, was wildly
popular with spectators, it was an anathema to most exhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, there were only a handful of entries and an
anticlimactic conclusion: it only took a 6-foot-6-inch leap for
Ballerina, ridden by Markus Merschformann of Germany, to capture
the class. The winning horse and rider said a definite neigh when
invited to test a higher wall.
</P>
<P>
   So the high vaulters at this year's show will be confined to the
international elite, including teams from the United Sates, Canada
and France, which will confront five-and-a-half-foot-high obstacles
in Sunday's grand prix.
</P>
<P>
   In the Nations Cup competition Friday evening, the United States
will attempt to monopolize the event for the third consecutive
year.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's program features the $30,000 Hunter Classic. On
Sunday, the ASPCA-Maclay Championship, a horsemanship competition
that often identifies future champions, will be decided after a
harrowing day of testing for 72 junior riders.
</P>
<P>
   The show also features equine entertainers including Bonfire,
the Michael Jordan of dressage horses. But the charro champion,
Jerry Diaz, and his trick quarter horses, remain in a mood more
funereal than festive after narrowly surviving the flash floods
that ruined their San Antonio farm and drowned one horse Oct. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz said his 79-year-old father, Pepe, a charro star who
appeared at the Garden with Barnum &AMP; Bailey 44 years ago, suffered
a breakdown and had to be hospitalized after surveying the
wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to cancel, but my father wanted me to go to the
Garden, because it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience,'' Diaz said.
``So I'm cleaning the mud from the saddles with toothbrushes and
praying that my horses can do the act from memory. We're all pretty
much in shock.''

AFTER INJURY, UCLA'S COLEMAN GETS BETTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They could sever his Achilles' tendon or dislocate
his shoulder with a good, hard pull. Cracking his ribs isn't a bad
idea, either, and it's easy. A 10-pound dumbell should do.
</P>
<P>
   No, wait. If they break both his legs ... snap them like
fingers, clean and quick, placing his career in jeopardy, that
would do the trick. Kenyon Coleman would become Bruce Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The worse the injury, the better he responds.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Kenyon,'' said his father, Johnny. ``When he gets down,
it makes him stronger and more aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Since his Oct. 17 return from a sprained knee, Coleman has
become the rarest of Westwood commodities, a defensive lineman of
impact. In three games, Coleman has forced one fumble and recovered
two, he has deflected two passes and recorded three sacks _ the
first by a Bruins lineman this season. His play has elicited the
ultimate compliment from offensive lines: a double-team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenyon is finally starting to perform like he can,'' UCLA
defensive line coach Terry Tumey said. ``He can be as good as he
wants to be. The only thing that can stop him is if he loses his
drive.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first time Coleman, a sophomore end, has returned
from injury new and improved. After missing his junior season at
Alta Loma High with a broken left leg, Coleman emerged as one of
the top recruits in California.
</P>
<P>
   His rehabilitation was so intense the bad leg actually tested
three times stronger than the good one at his UCLA physical. The
medical staff looked at the results, then told Coleman he was
confused: He must have broken his right leg; the left was too
strong to have been damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``When that injury happened, a lot of coaches thought Kenyon's
career was finished,'' Johnny said. ``He got real intense, worked
out on his own. It seemed to make him stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are similarities to this season. When he came back a few
weeks ago, he was very motivated. He took it to a different
level.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman rebuffed Notre Dame and became a watershed recruit when
he signed with the Bruins in Feb. 1997. At 6-foot-5 and 275 pounds,
with a frame capable of carrying 300, he possesses the combination
of size and speed normally found at Florida State and Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA hasn't had an All-Pac-10 defensive lineman since Tumey in
1987. After years of being undersized and overmatched _ linebackers
playing end, ends playing tackle _ the Bruins finally had a
potentially dominant lineman, able to stuff the run, generate a
consistent pass rush and draw double-teams.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, 19, played in every game last season as a true
freshman, making two tackles for losses and recovering three
fumbles. But his plans for an all-conference year in '98 were
derailed on Sept. 19 at Houston, when he sprained the medial
collateral ligament in his knee.
</P>
<P>
   Engrossed with the injury to receiver Freddie Mitchell, who had
broken his leg a few minutes earlier, Coleman failed to grasp the
initial prognosis: out 3-4 weeks. And because the Miami game was
canceled five days later, the injury didn't puncture Coleman's
psyche until the Washington State game Oct. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sitting and watching that game was hard,'' he said. ``I kept
thinking about how hard I worked all year for 11 or 12 games.
Realizing I was going to miss three or four games, that made me
mad. I knew I had to make the most of every game once I got back. I
saw the season flying by.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman's play and UCLA's success in the stretch are
inseparable. The Bruins cannot survive Oregon State, Washington,
USC and Miami without effective line play against the run and pass.
A sporadic pass rush _ by the line and the linebackers _ had as
much to do with the Stanford scare as poor coverage by the
defensive backs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the line is UCLA's youngest unit, with two freshmen, two
sophomores and two juniors in the six-man rotation. Coleman is the
bridge, more talented than juniors Travor Turner and Pete Holland,
more experienced than freshmen Ken Kocher and Anthony Fletcher.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, when Kocher and Fletcher and redshirts Sean Phillips
and Rusty Williams mature, the Bruins might have a line for the
ages. But for now, for this week and this month, Coleman is as
close to the complete package as they've got.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting Kenyon back has really helped,'' coach Bob Toledo
said. ``He's playing better. Teams are double-teaming him a lot.
They know he's our best lineman.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, about that broken clavicle.
</P>

NBA PLAYERS HAVE A $20 MILLION WAR CHEST AVAILABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The National Basketball Players Association has built
a cash hoard of $20 million for the current owners' lockout, a
financial security blanket that exists because of a significant
change in its most recent labor agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The change has belatedly brought the union millions of dollars
in royalties during the past two years from the sale of licensed
merchandise like trading cards, T-shirts and other products using
players' likenesses. Licensing revenues provide the cash lifeblood
for sports unions and enriched the baseball and football players'
organizations well before they came to basketball.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the NBA's licensed business exploded in the 1990s,
the union's labor deal provided only for players to receive a lump
sum of licensing revenues in the 11th year of their retirements.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1995 collective bargaining agreement mandated
multimillion annual payments to the union, parts of which have been
placed in reserve after the rest was paid out to the players, said
Dan Wasserman, a union spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   As of June 30, 1998, the union had $20.9 million in cash,
according to its annual LM-2 filing with the U.S. Labor Department.
The size of the war chest seems small when one considers that
Michael Jordan made nearly twice that last season, but considering
the union's past finances, it is a major reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Only two years ago, the union reported cash of $973,519.
</P>
<P>
   The filing shows that $16.6 million of the union's $20.9 million
in cash, came from licensing revenues that haven't yet been paid to
the players.
</P>
<P>
   During the 12 months that ended June 30, the union received
$26.6 million from NBA Properties, then distributed $22.1 million
to the players. The union is expecting $6 million more from NBA
Properties this year, Wasserman said, which should increase the
size of the war chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, about 75 players have said they will pass on their
distribution this year to help players in financial difficulty,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996-97 filing shows that the union received $42.7 million
in royalties _which appears to be a two-year payment _ and
distributed $30.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   No royalties were received in the 1995-96 period, a year when
the largest source of revenues came from union dues of $1.5
million. NBA players pay $5,000 a year in dues, except for minimum
salary players, who pay $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   The NBPA's lockout fund, which would pay players salaries for as
long as the stoppage lasts, is puny compared with the estimated
$200 million amassed by the Major League Baseball Players
Association for the 1994-95 strike.
</P>
<P>
   That fund was built from licensing revenues, which soared to
$87.4 million in 1992. According to its Labor Department filings,
the baseball union deferred distributing $150 million in royalties
to players until after the strike.
</P>
<P>
   With increased licensing revenues, the basketball players union
has paid its executive director steadily more. In 1995-96, Simon
Gourdine was paid $456,730. In 1996-97, Billy Hunter, who replaced
Gourdine, earned $590,223. And in the most recent year, Hunter's
salary rose to $788,422.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Donald Fehr, the executive director of the
baseball players association, was paid $892,200 in 1997, less than
the $950,000 he received in 1995 and 1996 because of pay cuts taken
during the strike.
</P>
<P>
   After Hunter, the highest paid NBPA executive from 1997 to 1998
was Robert Lanza, the senior counsel, at $176,410. Fehr's three
highest-paid employees in 1997, including Mark Belanger, made over
$400,000. Belanger, a former Orioles shortstop who died recently,
earned $474,342. &QL;

THE UNKNOWN QUARTERBACK IS WELL KNOWN TO THE NFL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Daunte Culpepper squeezed his 6-foot-4-inch,
240-pound frame into an office chair and talked about the evolution
of quarterbacking. He has played the position since 10th grade,
when he innocently threw a ball 50 yards in practice after being
overthrown on a pass pattern. Now at age 21, Culpepper is the
quarterback at the University of Central Florida.
</P>
<P>
   He is a tank, like Steve McNair, only bigger. He is Houdini,
like Doug Flutie, only capable of making the defender disappear
with the drop of a shoulder. He is elusive, like Kordell Stewart,
only preferring to stay put in the pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Culpepper can take a pounding and give it out. The last quality
is his greatest virtue. For all the talk about evolution, mixing
size and speed and mobility, Culpepper subscribes to one unshakable
truth: ``You have to be able to stand in the pocket. You have to
get hit in your teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   That, football fans, is Daunte Culpepper, one of the great
college quarterbacks you may never see in action. He has stood in
the pocket virtually from the time he was born, and life's blitzes
have never rattled him. Those are the qualities he brings to the
football field. But because he plays at a relatively obscure,
independent Division I school, much of the nation doesn't get to
see him.
</P>
<P>
   Pro scouts do, however, and they are projecting him as a high
draft pick next spring, perhaps the first quarterback selected.
Culpepper leads the nation in completion percentage, connecting on
73.7 percent of his passes, which is ahead of the current National
Collegiate Athletic Association record of 71.3, set by Steve Young
at Brigham Young in 1983. Culpepper's pass efficiency rating of
178.7 is ahead of Danny Wuerffel's NCAA record of 178.4, set at the
University of Florida in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with 10,640 yards passing and 876 yards rushing in his
career, Culpepper needs 124 yards rushing in his final three games
to become only the third player in the history of college football
to pass for 10,000 yards and rush for 1,000 in a career. The only
others to do so are Alcorn State's McNair (1991-94) and Idaho's
Doug Nussmeier (1990-93).
</P>
<P>
   Last week against Youngstown State, Culpepper completed 31 of 41
attempts for 347 yards and 4 touchdowns, leading Central Florida to
a 44-32 victory in Orlando. He carried the ball 14 times for 63
yards and one touchdown. With 410 yards of total offense, Culpepper
moved into eighth place on the career NCAA total offense list for
all divisions with 11,543 yards.
</P>
<P>
   His performance has helped Central Florida to a 7-1 record, the
best start in school history, heading into a pivotal game at Auburn
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see myself as a drop-back quarterback who can run and
improvise if I have to,'' Culpepper said.
</P>
<P>
   But statistics hardly represent just who Daunte Culpepper is and
what he represents. The inner story is a story of love, of family,
and of a real-life example of a village's raising a child.
</P>
<P>
   In Daunte's case, the village is Emma Culpepper. Daunte was born
Jan. 28, 1977, and the drama of his life began immediately. His
biological mother, in a home for unwed mothers in Ocala, Fla.,
realized she couldn't raise a son. In desperation she asked Emma
Culpepper, a house mother there, to take her son and raise him.
</P>
<P>
   By that time Emma was 62, and had already raised 14 children,
none of them hers. She raised her brother's children after he died,
then her brother's widow's children after that. It had been her
life's mission. She agreed to do it one last time.
</P>
<P>
   ``What she did was awesome,'' said Daunte. ``A lot of people
wouldn't have even taken that chance or wouldn't have taken the
time to do what she did. She could have said `I'm too old,' or `I
don't have time.' She could have made a lot of excuses, but she
didn't. If it wasn't for her, I don't know where I'd be.''
</P>
<P>
   Emma Culpepper is the pivotal person in Daunte's life. She is
the staff and the rod, and never spared either. Even now, in the
safety of an office, the solidly built Culpepper cringes when he
thinks of Emma's motherly discipline. Sports didn't provide
discipline, she did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't have been disciplined any stiffer than what my mom
did,'' he said. ``She used to put it on me if I messed up. She's
from the old school: she didn't have all that timeout and any of
that. She put it on me: belt, shoes, anything, man. Anything.
Switches. It didn't matter. And I really needed it. Without the
fear of that; when I had a decision to make, I might have made the
wrong decision and it could have been a real bad decision that put
me behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know the saying, `Give 'em an inch they take a mile?' I
was one of those kids who would have taken a mile.''
</P>
<P>
   Culpepper always knew his biological mother, knew where she was,
and was kept abreast of her situation. When she got herself back on
her feet, family officials tried to reunite mother and son, and
arranged for Daunte to live with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't having it,'' Culpepper recalled. ``Nothing against my
biological mother because I love her, but I'd grown so close to
Emma Culpepper I felt that she was my biological mom. I couldn't be
without her. Every day I wasn't with her I cried and cried. I
couldn't help it.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, his biological mother returned Daunte to Emma
Culpepper. ``I know it nearly broke her heart,'' Daunte said. ``But
I was a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   His biological mother is a social worker, has recovered from
childhood troubles and now stays on the periphery of her son's
life. Culpepper holds no grudges. Probably the greatest indication
that Culpepper has become a leader is that he learned not to sit in
judgment of people _ not of his mother, not of the father he never
knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't blame my biological mom for anything,'' he said. ``She
did what was best for me. I call her `mom.' I love her like she's
my mom. I'm a lot more mature now and I understand a lot more
things. Whatever happened, I was with somebody who loved me good
enough to be my mom and dad.''
</P>
<P>
   If, as scouts project, Culpepper may be the first quarterback
selected in the June draft, it will mean an imminent change in
financial status. Will it mean a different, less grounded
Culpepper?
</P>
<P>
   Daunte said he wouldn't think of changing. With Emma Culpepper
watching? You must be kidding.

MAN MARKS 50 YEARS PERFORMING STUNTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- After 66 years, Bob Yerkes' knees creak a little
when he bends and stretches.
</P>
<P>
   He's a tad stiffer than he used to be when he catapults into a
back flip from a swing in his back yard or gyrates in the air over
a trampoline.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite the tolls of age, this is a man who still can vault
from a seven-story window (in a bra and dress, no less) and land
safely on an air bag below. And he's not even close to retiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get hurt so bad I can't do it, I might,'' said the
resident of the suburban Los Angeles community of Northridge. ``But
once I retire, I'll just fall apart. So I just plan on keeping
going.''
</P>
<P>
   With more than half a century of circus and movie acrobatics
under his belt, Yerkes is one of Hollywood's oldest working
stuntmen, and still executes maneuvers most 20-year-olds would
never attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``His reputation is very, very good, he's in very, very
excellent shape,'' said Loren Janes, co-founder of the Stuntman's
Association of Motion Picture and Television, who rates Yerkes
among the top 30 or 40 stuntmen in the business. ``Whatever he says
he can do, he can do.''
</P>
<P>
   While Yerkes' wispy white hair and lined face set him apart from
his young colleagues, his compact, muscular, Jack LaLanne-like
physique is just as fit as theirs.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Yerkes plunged seven stories in a Burt Reynolds
cable movie called ``Hostage Hotel,'' torquing his body sideways to
reach an air bag located not directly below, but off to the side.
And he performed that feat dressed as a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was doubling Charles Durning, then they brought
out a bra and a dress,'' he said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   He has swung across the Sherman Oaks Galleria in Sherman Oaks,
Calif., for Arnold Schwarzenegger in ``Commando,'' slid down a rope
for Christopher Lloyd in ``Back to the Future'' and even doubled
for fellow stuntman Super Dave Osborne.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years he has fallen, fought or jumped for other
stars in movies including the ``Batman'' series, ``Return of the
Jedi,'' ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit,'' ``Weird Science,''
``Poltergeist'' and ``Ghostbusters,'' to name a few out of dozens.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, he received the Best Highwork Award for swinging by one
hand from the Statue of Liberty in the movie ``Remo Williams.''
</P>
<P>
   His TV credentials include ``Chicago Hope,'' ``Northern
Exposure,'' ``Moonlighting,'' ``Murder, She Wrote,'' ``The Dukes of
Hazzard,'' ``Wonder Woman,'' ``Starsky and Hutch,'' ``Gilligan's
Island'' and ``MacGyver.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Santa Monica, Calif., and raised in nearby Culver City,
Yerkes (rhymes with circus) learned acrobatics by tumbling at
Southern California's Muscle Beach in Venice when he was 11. Four
years later, his parents divorced, and he ran away to join the
Clyde Beatty circus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The circus was a close family,'' he said. ``It used to be that
town folks didn't want their kids hanging around circus folks. Now
circus folks don't want their kids hanging around town folks. It's
about the last family entertainment that doesn't need a censor.''
</P>
<P>
   In between circus seasons he did stunts in Hollywood. During
on-set discussions he discovered that he differed with some of his
liberal colleagues. He became active in Republican politics and in
Christian groups, including one that airlifts persecuted Russian
Jews to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anti-Semitism is popping up everywhere,'' he said. ``And
during the second World War the Christians weren't outspoken
enough, so we're not going to make the same mistake again.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, he gave up the circus life for a steady stream
of stunt work, settling in Northridge in a home he filled with
swords, showgirl costumes, carousel horses and glossy shots of
himself with Hollywood stars and starlets. He was married for 25
years and had two sons. One died in the Vietnam War, and the other
is now a screenwriter.
</P>
<P>
   In his back yard, Yerkes possesses a full array of circus gear
-- a trampoline, a trapeze, air bags, tumbling mats and a Russian
swing, which is a device used to catapult performers skyward.
</P>
<P>
   There he has trained and nurtured dozens of young men and women
who followed in his footsteps, and has asked nothing in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to come here 20 years ago,'' said Steve Lambert, 43, of
Northridge. ``There's been a lot of generations that came here to
practice and perfect our art. He's a very important person to a lot
of people -- action people.''
</P>
<P>
   Norbert Phillips, 30, of Encino, who trained with Yerkes at
Disney-MGM Studios in Florida, recalled their first meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw this little old man with polio crutches,'' he said, but
didn't realize they were stunt props.
</P>
<P>
   When he discovered Yerkes was the trainer, he said, ``I thought,
My God, this is what I have to look forward to!''
</P>
<P>
   But watching Yerkes nimbly navigate his backyard circus rigs on
a recent weekend, Phillips said: ``Bob is probably the most
incredible stunt guy I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Leigh Hennessy, a Silver Lake, Calif., stuntwoman and trampoline
champion, said Yerkes is a role model in longevity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not concerned that at 50 I won't be able to do that
anymore, because he's still doing it at close to 70,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Janes, of the stuntman's association, said Yerkes has survived
by being a professional -- not a daredevil -- carefully planning
and executing each dangerous feat.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask, Did Bobby retire?'' Phillips said. ``I say, No, he
just did a 70-foot fall the other day.''

CANADIENS DEFEAT RANGERS, 4-1 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The scoring-challenged New York Rangers have been
looking for that new face who can put the puck in the net, and they
found him on Wednesday night at Madison Square Garden. He was Jose
Theodore, the masked Montreal goalie, who accidentally put one over
his own goal line when he tried to clear a loose puck that had
trickled behind him into the crease.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Rangers, that was the only time the red
light ignited behind the goalie in the red uniform. At the other
end of the ice, it flashed four times and the Canadiens emerged
with a 4-1 victory. Three of the goals beat Rangers goalie Mike
Richter, and the final goal was into an empty net.
</P>
<P>
   With all those trade rumors circulating in the boo-filled
Garden, can help be on the way? Can any of those locked-out
basketball players skate?
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't wait for somebody who is coming,'' said John MacLean,
who got credit for the Ranger goal after his shot trickled through
the pads of the goalie and came to rest in the crease before
Theodore mis-hit it. ``We've got to work doubly hard or harder just
to keep it going.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second consecutive defeat for the Rangers, who had
three victories and three ties in their previous six games.
Averaging 1.5 goals a game, lowest in the NHL, they are last in
both the Atlantic Division and the Eastern Conference. Their record
is 3-6-3 and they will spend most of November on the road, playing
in Florida, California and in the Rust Belt. Their next game is
Saturday night in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal's goal scorers were Shayne Corson, Mark Recchi, Martin
Rucinsky and Vincent Damphousse. Recchi scored on the power play.
The Rangers were 0 for 4 on their manpower advantages and managed
only 20 shots on goal. They hit two posts and fired several wide.
The line of MacLean, Kevin Stevens and Esa Tikkanen was most
effective.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to encourage more offensive production, Rangers Coach
John Muckler shuffled his other forward lines. He moved Niklas
Sundstrom off Wayne Gretzky's left wing and put him alongside
center Todd Harvey, who had been Gretzky's right wing. Gretzky was
flanked by Adam Graves and Mike Knuble.
</P>
<P>
   P.J. Stock, usually a fourth-line center, got more ice time than
usual because Harvey spent time in the penalty box after two
fights. The second, with Craig Rivet, left Harvey with blood on his
right hand. Manny Malhotra, the rookie Rangers center, who had not
dressed for three of the previous four games, played a few shifts
and was effective, finishing his checks at every opportunity and
nearly scoring on a deflection.
</P>
<P>
   Muckler admitted he sounds ``like a broken record,'' but said
the Rangers need to get their shots through from the point men on
the blue line and need to hit the net more instead of missing it or
hitting the posts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the pressure mounts to add a proven goal
scorer,'' Muckler said. ``I still don't think our hockey team's
that bad offensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Leetch, the captain, said, ``We're a better-scoring team
than we are right now.''
</P>
<P>
   MacLean warned, ``You can't get down on yourself because you
start squeezing your stick and then you don't shoot, you don't do
what you should be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of not shooting, Gretzky and Leetch each had one shot
on goal, same as Malhotra. They played 23 minutes 51 seconds and
28:26. Malhotra played 2:06. Sundstrom had none in 16:10.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadiens, without a victory in their previous four games,
played without Saku Koivu, their best player, who is out with an
abdominal injury that could be serious. A similar injury has cost
them Scott Thornton for the season. Defenseman Vladimir Malakhov
blocked a puck in the final minute and crawled off the ice. But he
said he was all right. &QL;

MISSION: FIND SOWARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Whether defenses are double-teaming him or the
quarterback has had trouble finding him, one of USC's goals this
week is to find a way to get the ball in R. Jay Soward's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Soward has caught just four passes the past two games, after
catching 23 in USC's first six games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very rough for me to handle,'' Soward said. ``I expect
the ball a little more. I'm not worried about it. I'm going to be
patient. I don't know if it's me not getting open or the
quarterbacks and I are not on the same page.''
</P>
<P>
   After studying game films the past two weeks, USC coach Paul
Hackett believes he has discovered the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hackett wants to get the ball to Soward 15-20 times a
game, he said Soward had only eight opportunities against Oregon
and seven against Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to have more than that,'' Hackett said. ``We need to
be more imaginative. He is a force. We've got to get him the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said now that quarterback Carson Palmer is getting more
snaps in practice, he is getting more accustomed to Soward's speed,
which seems one gear faster than the rest of the receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to help me a lot now that Carson and I are going to
practice together and know what to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Morton ailing: Tailback Chad Morton has not practiced this
week, bothered by a sore ankle that he hurt against Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tried to go today, but we chose to keep him out,'' Hackett
said. ``I would fully anticipate he'll be ready, but that remains
to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Morton is believed to be completely recovered from the back
injuries that sidelined him earlier in the season.
</P>
<P>
   Fullback Ted Iacenda also missed practice, bothered by a sore
shoulder. He is expected to be available Saturday. Before the
injury, Hackett said Marvin Powell had a ``slight edge'' at
fullback over Iacenda this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been more than one guy all year long,'' Hackett said.
``It's just going to be manned by a number of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Offensive tackle Matt Welch has been bothered by a hyperextended
shoulder that might require surgery after the season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Cancel kicking competition: David Bell suffered a bruised
foot and did not practice Wednesday, leaving Adam Abrams to take
all the kicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit the ball very well,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he did not want to try punter Mike MacGillivray,
who was also a placekicker at Loyola, at kicker.
</P>
<P>
   __ Claiborne update: Linebacker Chris Claiborne admitted that he
frequently goes back and forth regarding whether he should turn pro
after the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``My status changes from day to day,'' Claiborne said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Claiborne said he was having fun and might stay at
USC. He said this week that he would send in an inquiry to the NFL
after the season to gauge where he might be drafted.
</P>
<P>
   __ Steele visits: Linebacker Markus Steele of Long Beach City
College stopped by practice and visited the coaches Wednesday.
Steele committed to the Trojans last summer.

 By JOHN McCLAIN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
For those who thought Denver's victory over Green Bay in Super Bowl
XXXII was a fluke and that the NFC would re-establish its
superiority, think again. The first half of the NFL season has
proved two things: The Broncos are still the best team, and the AFC
is clearly the better conference.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The AFC is 19-9 (.679) against the NFC. At this pace, the AFC
will become the first conference to record 40 victories in
interconference games.
</P>
<P>
   Television ratings, which had been down, have bounced back after
Sunday's San Francisco-Green Bay game produced the highest rating
in two years.
</P>
<P>
   It has been an offensive half season. Nineteen runners are on
pace for 1,000 yards, which would set a league record; 23 receivers
are on pace for 1,000 yards, which would tie the record.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos (8-0) are halfway to joining the 1972 Dolphins as
the only unbeaten teams since the 1970 NFL-AFL merger. Barring an
injury to running back Terrell Davis, the best player in the
league, the Broncos will secure the playoff home-field advantage
with ease.
</P>
<P>
   The AFC also boasts such Super Bowl pretenders as Jacksonville,
Pittsburgh, Miami, Buffalo, New England, the New York Jets and
Oakland. But none is comparable to Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota (7-1) is the best team in the NFC, but the Vikings
showed their vulnerability Sunday when they were upset at Tampa
Bay. Green Bay (6-2) and San Francisco (6-2) are the only NFC teams
that appear strong enough to pressure the Vikings for the
home-field advantage.
</P>
<P>
   If you're putting your money on Denver's Mike Shanahan or
Minnesota's Dennis Green to do the best coaching job to win a Super
Bowl, don't put the green on Green; he has coached only one playoff
game.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos lead the league in scoring with an average of 34.1
points a game. They have beaten four teams with winning records _
New England, Dallas, Oakland and Jacksonville. Since the season
opener, Denver has scored fewer than 33 points only once.
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos are so good that voters in six counties approved a
referendum Tuesday that will provide public money for a new stadium
to replace Mile High Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In Davis, the Broncos have the NFL's top rusher (1,150 yards).
He has scored 14 touchdowns and is on pace to break Eric
Dickerson's season rushing record (2,105) and Emmitt Smith's season
touchdown record (25).
</P>
<P>
   Since 1970, nine teams have been 8-0. All reached the playoffs,
and seven advanced to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Denver plays in the AFC West, the league's best division. The
NFL's most competitive division is the AFC East, where four teams
are 5-3. The last time four teams were tied for first this late in
the season was in 1987, when every AFC East team was 4-4.
</P>
<P>
   The NFC East is the worst division; its teams are 1-11 against
the AFC. The NFC Central is the best division in its conference, by
default.
</P>
<P>
   How about this brain strain: Pick the last wild-card team in the
NFC. Tampa Bay and New Orleans are the only candidates that don't
have losing records, and they are 4-4.
</P>
<P>
   If the league is as good as its worst teams, then perhaps the
NFC should become a minor league. Only Indianapolis (1-7) in the
AFC has a terrible record, but the Colts aren't dreadful.
</P>
<P>
   Manning leads the league with 16 interceptions but is on pace to
pass for a rookie-record 3,746 yards and tie a record with 22
touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
   The NFC has Philadelphia, Washington and Carolina, all 1-7. At
2-6, St. Louis is almost as bad. Detroit is 2-6, too, but part of
the reason is because the Lions are starting a rookie, Charlie
Batch, at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   The league is full of surprises, good and bad. Take the
quarterback success stories.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo's Doug Flutie, who leads the AFC with a passer rating of
102.7, is the half-season success story. ``He just wins games,''
Buffalo tight end Jay Riemersma says. ``He's done that everywhere
he's been _ even though he's too short.''
</P>
<P>
   In any other season, the most amazing story would be the
Vikings' Randall Cunningham. He was out of football in 1996, signed
with the Vikings as a backup last season and now is guiding
Minnesota toward Super Bowl XXXIII.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham is 5-1 as a starter. He has 16 touchdown passes and
three interceptions, and his 114.3 passer rating leads the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' Vinny Testaverde is 5-0 as a starter and has 12
touchdown passes against two interceptions as he tries to play on a
team with a winning record for only the second time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Close behind is Atlanta's Chris Chandler. When Chandler has been
healthy the last two seasons, the Falcons are 12-4. But he remains
injury-prone. If Chandler stays on the field, he will spark the
Falcons to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Who would have thought 15 quarterbacks, including Baltimore's
Eric Zeier, Dallas' Jason Garrett, Chicago's Erik Kramer and
Carolina's Steve Beuerlein, would have ratings higher than Green
Bay's Brett Favre, who is still the second-best player in the
league despite having thrown 15 interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   All the news hasn't been good, of course. Oakland coach Jon
Gruden, who is doing an outstanding job in his first season, was
arrested for driving under the influence. Quarterback Kerry Collins
quit on Carolina and let down New Orleans when he was arrested for
driving while intoxicated.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego fired coach Kevin Gilbride five games into the season
with three years left on his contract. He was just the first of
what should be many coaching changes _ soon or after the season.
</P>
<P>
   There have been strange moments. When the Oilers needed to
attempt a game-tying field goal in a three-point loss to Chicago,
they couldn't find kicker Al Del Greco, who went brain dead,
leaving backup holder Craig Hentrich to attempt a 49-yard kick out
of the hold of backup quarterback Dave Krieg. Fittingly, it was
blocked.
</P>
<P>
   Also, San Diego quarterback Ryan Leaf threw a fit at a reporter
and was embarrassed nationally when the outburst was caught on
videotape.
</P>
<P>
   With half the season over, expect the play to get better as the
temperature dips and the playoff races heat up. Here's what to look
for:
</P>
<P>
   AFC East _ What a race: The Patriots won the division the last
two years. The Bills are the biggest surprise. The Dolphins have
the best defense. The Jets have won five of six and have a Super
Bowl coach in Bill Parcells. The teams that don't win the division
will compete for wild-card spots.
</P>
<P>
   AFC Central _ The Jaguars are threatening to end a Steelers
reign that began in 1994. Pittsburgh's offense is a mess; unless
quarterback Kordell Stewart emerges from a slump that began in
December or gets benched in favor of Mike Tomczak, the Steelers may
continue to fall. The Oilers are 4-4 but too inconsistent to be
taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   AFC West _ Expect the Broncos to get the home-field advantage
and try not to get bored in December. Oakland, which has won two
more games than it did all last season, has a two-game lead over
Kansas City and Seattle. The Chiefs and Seahawks are going to have
to make up a lot of ground to earn playoff berths.
</P>
<P>
   NFC East _ The 'Boys are back in town. Chan Gailey is doing a
superb coaching job in Dallas, Emmitt Smith isn't over the hill,
and Troy Aikman is healthy. They should run away with the NFL's
worst division and host the worst wild-card team.
</P>
<P>
   NFC Central _ The Vikings are the best team. If they beat Green
Bay at the Metrodome on Nov. 22, they will sweep the series.
Without a good running game for the cold-weather games, look for
the Pack to settle for a wild-card berth. Tampa Bay, 4-0 at home
and 0-4 on the road, is a contender for the last wild-card spot.
</P>
<P>
   NFC West _ It looks strange to see Atlanta tied with San
Francisco at the top. The 49ers won an earlier meeting; the Falcons
host the Niners on Nov. 15. Still, expect San Francisco to win and
the Falcons to earn a wild-card berth. The Saints are 4-4 because
Mike Ditka and his staff are doing an exceptional job, but they
aren't a serious playoff contender.

PENALTIES COULD MEAN LOSS OF INSURANCE FOR CALIFORNIA MOTORISTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Daily News Staff Writer Lisa Van Proyen contributed to this
story.)  &HT;     BY SHERRY JOE CROSBY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- For bad drivers, the new rule is three points and
you're out.
</P>
<P>
   Under new auto insurance regulations that went into effect
Wednesday, California motorists can lose their insurance -- and
eventually be forced to pay higher premiums -- if they receive
three penalty points for bad driving during a three-year period.
</P>
<P>
   State insurance officials said the change -- it took three
points in just one year to trigger penalties before -- will allow
companies to crack down on drunk and bad drivers while lowering
rates for the vast majority of Californians classified as good
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good drivers will be paying less and not subsidizing the
bad drivers, the lawbreakers, the drunk drivers and the uninsured
motorists,'' said Dana Spurrier, press secretary for state
Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new regulations, motorists who receive a speeding
ticket and are caught driving under the influence of alcohol or
drugs could lose their auto insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Points are assigned to traffic tickets in California based on
the severity of the violation. For example, an illegal turn is one
point while alcohol-related offenses, such as drunk driving, are
two. Drivers are allowed to go to traffic school to remove
one-point violations from their records.
</P>
<P>
   ``These new regulations penalize drunk drivers and further
reduce auto insurance rates for all of us,'' Spurrier said.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations evoked mixed reactions from motorists.
</P>
<P>
   Merrilyn Lemons, 60, of the suburban Los Angeles community of
Woodland Hills said if she was asked how she felt 40 years ago
about the change, she'd be incensed, because she had three moving
violations within a year at age 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a letter from the governor saying I was a menace on the
road,'' Lemons said at the Automobile Club in the San Fernando
Valley community of West Hills on Wednesday. ``Now, that I'm in my
more mellow years, anything that will lower the insurance rates is
fine by me.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics said the new rules will penalize ordinary drivers
who have minor collisions and will result in more uninsured
motorists on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``The changes will allow a lot of insurance companies to not
renew or cancel insurance for a lot of mishaps,'' said Lillian
Salinger, attorney for the Proposition 103 Enforcement Project,
which unsuccessfully fought against the regulations. ``This will
really affect ordinary drivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the changes said high-risk drivers can shop around
and find another auto insurance company, but probably will face
substantial rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations could affect an estimated 1 million
California drivers who might lose their insurance or pay higher
premiums during the next three years. Mothers Against Drunk
Driving, which has campaigned for harsher drunk driving penalties,
endorsed the regulation changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strong message it sends is you will be held accountable if
you choose to drive under the influence,'' said Becky Bearden,
chairwoman of the public policy committee for MADD. ``We always
support any efforts made by the state of California toward reducing
tragedies caused by impaired drivers. Anything that gets tough on
drunk driving and thereby reduces the number of people killed or
injured we are in support of.''
</P>
<P>
   But Salinger said the state law already provides for ways to
cancel the insurance of drunk drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These new regulations have nothing to do with drunk driving,''
Salinger said. ``Increasing (penalties) for this behavior is
unwarranted under the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurance industry officials disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   About half of California's traffic violations involve alcohol,
said Jerry Davies, spokesman for the Personal Insurance Federation,
a trade group that initiated the regulation changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the history of alcohol offenses, they've been
growing each year,'' said Davies, whose organization represents the
six companies that insure 50 percent of California's motorists.
``Good drivers are being more intolerant of people who want to
break the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Outraged about the new rules was Nino Brown, 27, of Woodland
Hills, who just six months ago got a ticket for inadvertently
turning against a ``no turning between 3 p.m. and 7 p.m.'' sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really fair. People have accidents. That's why
they're called accidents,'' Brown said. ``Sometimes, things just
happen. How do you balance the two: the bad drivers from those who
make mistakes. . . . I just didn't see the sign.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gene Tripp, 67, a state-certified driver's training
instructor who lives in Tarzana in the San Fernando Valley
northwest of downtown Los Angeles, praised the changes --
especially, he said, since his son was hit by an uninsured driver
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't argue with that at all because they're bad drivers,''
Tripp said.

WIN THIS ONE FOR THE BUBBER

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With a Big Sky championship and playoff berth
getting closer with each win, there's plenty at stake for Cal State
Northridge. As if any more incentive is needed, Matadors coach Ron
Ponciano came up with a tad more for Saturday's home finale against
Portland State.
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano wants to win in honor of Paul Bubb, the school's
athletic director who was forced to resign Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope and pray we win because he's going to get the game
ball,'' Ponciano said. ``I know he put his heart and soul into
this. I think he did it right. As far as football scholarships, he
allotted a little bit every year, he increased the support every
year, and even though it's not up to snuff with everyone else,
that's OK because we've gotten better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team deserves it and he deserves it. And we're going to
try to get a Big Sky championship for him. That's what I want to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano, hired by Bubb last January, is extremely loyal and has
been under a lot of noncoaching related stress the last couple of
days.
</P>
<P>
   Following Bubb's resignation, Ponciano said the outgoing
athletic director stopped by the football offices to say a few
words.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very, very emotional,'' Ponciano said. ``Whenever you
go through a bunch of emotions, it wears on you. And it's
definitely wearing me down, but I think our practices have been
good. That's what is really important. Who cares if coach feels
good?''
</P>
<P>
   __ Long, winding road: Freshman linebacker Lewis Blanton went
from walk-on to starter to buried backup in his first eight weeks
of college football, and he's having a hard time adjusting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm just sitting back waiting for next year, but if it
helps the team it's all right,'' Blanton said. ``I've been making
mental mistakes.... I'm not looking down or nothing. I don't feel
good. It's not a happy feeling, but I have to stick to it. Stay in
the weight room and watch film.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Cwik and Shayne Blakey have been strong at the
linebacker spot, which has relegated Blanton the bench.
</P>
<P>
   __ Beard return likely: Matadors nose guard Sean Beard, who
broke his leg in the fourth game of the season, said he expects to
return next week at Southwest Missouri State.
</P>
<P>
   Beard was at practice Wednesday working out with a medicine ball
and working on his lateral mobility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should get cleared Monday,'' said Beard, who's missed the
last four games.
</P>
<P>
   __ Short yardage: Quarterback Marcus Brady sat out the last few
minutes of practice with a sore groin but should return today....
Defensive lineman Mike Colunga is expected to play after missing
last week's game with an ankle injury.... Punter Ethan Beck kicked
off the last two days of practice because placekicker Manny Marquez
has a sore leg. It will be decided today who will handle the
kickoffs in Saturday's game.

   LOS ANGELES -- If anyone thinks ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' has
lost some of its patriotic, emotional clout in this country, they
should have been at Chatsworth High School on Friday night for the
homecoming football game with Taft High School.
</P>
<P>
   A number of people who were at the campus in the suburban Los
Angeles community of Chatsworth northwest of downtown think the
national anthem got dissed, and they're still pretty mad about it.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what happened. You decide.
</P>
<P>
   The anthem normally is played about five minutes before kickoff,
after both teams have completed their warm-ups. But Friday night it
was sung about 10 minutes early because of all the scheduled
pregame homecoming activities.
</P>
<P>
   About 6:45 p.m., the public-address announcer asked everyone to
rise for the singing of the national anthem. Fans on both sides of
the field heard the announcement and stood up.
</P>
<P>
   The referees heard the announcement and stood at attention on
the sidelines. Chatsworth High's players took their helmets off,
and they also stood at attention with their coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Taft High's defensive players also took their helmets off and
stood at attention on the sidelines. But on the field, Taft's
offensive team continued running plays and warming up as the anthem
was being sung a cappella by a Chatsworth High student in front of
a microphone nearby.
</P>
<P>
   This drew a chorus of boos and jeers from parents on the
Chatsworth side who said they couldn't believe it when Taft's
coaches told their players to keep warming up.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were yelling, Rude, rude! and screaming at the Taft
coach to stop,'' said Chatsworth parent Kim Ponther. ``Anyone in
America knows that when you play the anthem at a sporting event
like this, you stop whatever you're doing and show respect for the
flag and country.''
</P>
<P>
   Janet Skinner, who has grandchildren attending Chatsworth High,
called the scene discouraging.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a nurse during World War II, and saw what our kids
sacrificed,'' she said. ``So to see these kids continue practicing
while the national anthem was being sung was very disheartening.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were yelling, Stop -- get them off the field! The kids
had their helmets on, so I thought maybe they didn't hear the
anthem being sung. But their coaches didn't have any helmets on.''
</P>
<P>
   Sue Lepisto, acting principal at Taft High in suburban Woodland
Hills, said Wednesday that she questioned head football coach Troy
Starr about the incident after the school received several
complaints Monday from angry Chatsworth High parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The anthem was being sung early, a cappella, without the band,
and the speakers were not poised on the field,'' she said. ``He was
aware there was singing going on, but not aware that this was the
actual `Star-Spangled Banner' because it's normally played at 6:55
p.m., after the normal pregame practice time. This was a very
unusual situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had been made aware the anthem was going to be played
early, we would have stopped. But our coaches were focused on
warming up, and did not recognize this was the playing of `The
Star-Spangled Banner' until it was too late. It was unfortunate,
and not done deliberately.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Stevenson, one of the Taft coaches on the field during the
singing of the anthem, added there also was a safety issue
involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a certain amount of minutes to warm up,'' he said.
``Are we supposed to stop what we were doing and not allow our guys
to warm up properly?''
</P>
<P>
   For the national anthem, which takes about a minute to a minute
and a half to sing, the answer is yes, said David Donner, whose
wife is a teacher at Chatsworth High.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stadium is not that big, and the speakers were going full
blast, so you couldn't miss that this was `The Star-Spangled
Banner' being sung,'' Donner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coach couldn't stop his team (from warming up) for one
minute? Come on.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Wyett, principal at Chatsworth High, was out of the office
and unavailable for comment Wednesday, but Greg Lee, an assistant
principal, said students at the school came to him later, upset
that Taft continued to practice during the anthem.
</P>
<P>
   While city football section rules state that the anthem is to be
played between 6:50 and 7 p.m., Lee said it is not unusual that
there would be an adjustment in the timing of pregame activities at
a homecoming game because so much is going on.
</P>
<P>
   Lee doubted Taft High was notified beforehand that the anthem
would be sung earlier than usual, but it was loud and pretty hard
to miss once it started, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``A group of Taft people were having a little pregame dinner
outside the stadium, and they stopped eating to observe the anthem
because they heard it being sung inside the stadium,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Coan, Chatsworth High's head football coach, said Wednesday
that he did not think Starr was being disrespectful, and that
coaches are often intensely focused on how their team is practicing
and warming up for a game.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but it's hard to believe anyone could block out a whole
stadium standing up and paying tribute to a ``Star-Spangled
Banner'' being sung loudly enough to be heard by people outside the
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Taft won the game 27-25 to remain undefeated.

FROGS BARELY MISS GOALS IN 98-81 WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Tex _ TCU basketball coach Billy Tubbs paused,
attempting to remember a time when a Tubbs-coached team had scored
less than 100 points in an exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   He finally remembered, and a long time had passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was back when they still had the Cold War going on,'' Tubbs
said. ``The Russians just crushed us. I don't think we scored 70.''
</P>
<P>
   A score of at least 100 seemed tantalizingly close at times, yet
proved to be frustratingly elusive last night. TCU instead settled
for a 98-81 victory against a fairly strong Pella Windows team at
Daniel-Meyer Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs' victory came on the day when the ``USA Today''/ESPN
coaches preseason poll came out. The Frogs were ranked No. 24, a
distinction that didn't seem to impress or disappoint Tubbs too
much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go ahead and use that cliche I gave you, `It's not where you
start but where you finish,' which is an original of mine,'' Tubbs
said. ``It is interesting, though, that we can make this and not
Dick Vitale's top 40. That shows you what Dick knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs said a lot of that No. 24 ranking came because the Frogs
return standout Lee Nailon.
</P>
<P>
   Nailon finished with 26 points and nine rebounds, and transfer
Marquise Gainous led TCU in scoring (31 points) and rebounds (14).
</P>
<P>
   Gainous played in only his second game with Nailon, and this
tandem again showed they are going to cause plenty of problems
underneath.
</P>
<P>
   Gainous again benefited from double teams on Nailon that led to
dump passes to him and easy buckets.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was getting me the ball,'' Gainous said. ``We're learning
to work together.''
</P>
<P>
   Gainous might be learning Nailon's tendencies. He said he
already understands those of Tubbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the first day of practice, I learned the goal is to score
100 points and to get 25-30 turnovers,'' Gainous said.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs missed 100 when a shot from half-court fell short as
time expired, and they came a turnover short of forcing 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably should've pressed a little at the end,'' Tubbs
said jokingly. ``But I didn't want to set an exhibition record for
number of free throws by the opposing team.''
</P>
<P>
   There were 48 fouls called and four players fouled out,
including Pella Windows' Justin Wimmer with almost 18 minutes
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   A plethora of fouls provided a good show for Frogs fans, though.
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs sounded like he had already reached midseason form, and
had fans chanting ``Billy, Billy, Billy'' with his constant banter
with referees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I can do better than that,'' Tubbs said.
Extra points
</P>
<P>
   Off-guard Ryan Carroll didn't play last night. He's recovering
from surgery done this summer to repair ligament damage and remove
scar tissue in his right ankle. Tubbs said Carroll will practice
tomorrow. The Frogs are looking at possibly redshirting Carroll. .
. . Tubbs teams usually are known for their short benches, but TCU
got a bit of scoring from bench players last night. Freshman guard
Michael Causey and returning forward Scott Gradney both finished
with 12 points coming off the bench. ``I felt a lot more
comfortable tonight,'' Causey said.

every other King has failed over the past 126 minutes, 12 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must try to wake up everybody,'' said Jokinen, who'll be
playing on the top line between Luc Robitaille and Glen Murray. ``I
must score the goals and make the plays.''
</P>
<P>
   And with very little prodding, he'd probably collect ticket
stubs at the Forum doors and sing the national anthem, too (we hear
he warbles a pretty fair version of ``Vartland,'' the Finnish
anthem).
</P>
<P>
   When Jokinen talks about his game, there's a sweet seriousness
in his voice, as though his stated mission was to fix L.A.'s public
schools, not help the Kings out of a scoring pickle. He was
recalled from the minors Monday, the day after the Kings suffered
their third shutout loss in four games.
</P>
<P>
   Ahh, the passions and perils of youth. We look at Jokinen and
see a kid on the cusp of 20 with a future fit for, well, a King.
Jokinen looks in the mirror and sees all the Kings' honchos and
five million countrymen climbing on his back.
</P>
<P>
   He'd probably be more nervous if he wasn't such an old hand at
helping put the pieces of an offense back together again. After
appearing in eight games with the Kings at the start of last
season, Jokinen was shipped home to Finland for more seasoning. He
hooked up with his old team in Helsinki, which was struggling at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were having problems scoring,'' Jokinen said. ``They were
like the Kings are now.''
</P>
<P>
   After starting slowly, Jokinen finished with 39 points in 30
games. His numbers silenced the voices of other players who snidely
wondered aloud how good he really was if he wasn't in the United
States playing with the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   That's the thing we fail to grasp when we make light of his
experience-gathering missions to the minors and rave about all the
bright tomorrows in this 19-year-old's life. Back in his
hockey-crazed homeland, with its low-lying plateaus and mountainous
expectations, there's enormous pressure to succeed in the NHL now
or be written off as yesterday's news.
</P>
<P>
   It is tough living up to the expectations, Jokinen admitted.
``But that's my normal life,'' he said. ``That happens all the time
in Finland.''
</P>
<P>
   For someone with the weight of a country on his shoulders,
Jokinen is surprisingly jocular.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's hysterical,'' said Karen Boyce of the fourth Kings player
to whom she, her husband Chuck and their two children have opened
their El Segundo home.
</P>
<P>
   Like Darryl Sydor, Matt Johnson and Aki Berg before him, Jokinen
is treated like a member of the family. Just not, thankfully, like
the families Jokinen watches on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the `Jerry Springer Show,''' he said, smiling. ``I
watch it all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   After getting his morning fix of violence, Jokinen should be
ready to rumble. Even if he gets home from the morning skate too
late to catch the tail end of the 11 a.m. telecast on Channel 9,
you can bet whatever the Blues throw at Jokinen tonight, he'll be
ready.
</P>
<P>
   A check by The Scourge of St. Louis, Geoff Courtnall? Hey, it
can't be any more harrowing than trying to cash a check in
Springfield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Jokinen had opened a checking account in L.A. but was sent down
to the Kings' American Hockey League affiliate before he could
obtain a California driver's license. He quickly found out it's
easier to score a hat trick in the NHL than cash a check bearing a
California address in a Massachusetts bank using a Finnish license
as identification.
</P>
<P>
   In order to eat, Jokinen had to open up another checking account
at a bank within a slapshot of the Springfield Civic Center. His
goal is to be able to consolidate his assets in California. The
sooner, the better.
</P>
<P>
   Sleepy Springfield might have reminded Jokinen's girlfriend
Catarina of their native Finland, but it seemed more like Russia to
him. Nothing personal about the place, but Jokinen is in no hurry
to go back.
</P>
<P>
   Nine games was enough. Jokinen would sooner spend an off-day in
Toronto visiting the Hockey Hall of Fame _ the Kings will have one
there Dec. 1 _ than be free to go any time to the Basketball Hall
of Fame in Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to show everybody here I can play at this level,'' said
Jokinen, who collected nine points for the Falcons, all in a
five-game stretch. ``I know the style I have to play if I want to
stay here: Hit everybody and score goals and shoot the puck.''
</P>
<P>
   As Jokinen takes his second stab at NHL stardom, he'd do well to
remember something Berg once shared with Karen Boyce about her
bread machine. Sure, it simplifies the baking process but to what
end? In Finland, Berg went on to explain, it's not merely the
finished product that makes breadmaking such a joy. It's the
process of mixing the dough and patiently waiting for it to rise
and kneading the ball over and over in one's hands and, in due
time, molding something exquisite from one's own exertion.

MORE THAN JUST ANOTHER SANDAY DRIVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jeff Sanday, the former Cal State Northridge standout who made
headlines with an opening-round 63 as a Buick Invitational
qualifier at Torrey Pines in February, attempts to extend his
extraordinary year next week.
</P>
<P>
   He'll be one of two area golfers competing in the $100,000
TearDrop Tour West Coast Tour Championship, which runs Tuesday
through Thursday at Cypress Golf Club in Los Alamitos.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Acosta of Sherman Oaks, who won the state individual
championship for Redwood High in 1989, also will play. The TearDrop
is part of a nationwide developmental tour that has more than 70
stops and is worth a combined $1.3 million in prize money.
</P>
<P>
   TearDrop alums made up more than half of this year's Nike Tour
cardholders, and some have done much better. PGA Tour players Tommy
Tolles, Stewart Cink, Clarence Rose, Omar Uresti and Robert Damron
all have TearDrop roots.
</P>
<P>
   Considering what he's done this year, Sanday might soon join
that list. The 1995 state amateur champion has three rounds of
9-under par this year. He did it back-to-back in San Diego, where
he shot 63 to qualify for the Buick Invitational, then did it again
to get within a shot of the lead after the first round. Sanday shot
another 9-under round at a qualifier to earn a berth in the Nissan
Open at Valencia.
</P>
<P>
   It will be tough for anyone to shoot another 63 on Cypress'
extremely tight Pete Dye-designed course, which features 14 water
holes, distinctive high mounds and undulating fairways and greens.
</P>
<P>
   __ Hooper, again: Mike Hooper, the 49-year-old long-hitter who
has been battering and bettering the far fences at Woodley Lakes
and Vista Valencia driving ranges the past three years, recently
bashed the best senior long-drive field in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Hooper won his third consecutive senior long-drive title Oct. 24
with a 354-yard blast. Hooper's drive was 35 yards better than his
closest competitor in the 24-man final of the 45-over age group
national championship at Palms Oasis GC in Mesquite, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   Hooper earned $12,000 in the competition that had golfers
shooting at a 45-yard wide grid. Hooper won the contest with 334
yards in 1996 and 371 yards last year.
</P>
<P>
   But Hooper has hit farther, although not in a final. He ripped a
452-yard drive that caused a back injury, which limits his practice
to about 300 balls a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit just twice a week,'' Hooper said. ``I can't press it
with my back.''
</P>
<P>
   He backed up his driving-range work with physical training that
emphasized stretching and weight work and wound up with the
second-best drive of the week-long championship, where Hooper's 354
was topped only by open-division champion Jason Zuback (361).
</P>
<P>
   Hooper won using a 6-degree Callaway Biggest Big Bertha head and
50-inch Aldila Longwood XS shaft. Zuback earned $75,000 for his
third straight open division title. His Titleist head was mounted
on a 48-inch shaft manufactured by Harrison Sports Incorporated of
Pacoima.
</P>
<P>
   __ Aces all: Scholl Canyon in Glendale has produced five
holes-in-one on five different holes in less than six weeks.
Shirley Butler started the run by acing the 81-yard 17th hole Sept.
12, then Phil Macias found the cup with an 89-yard shot on No. 11,
followed by George E. Malmen on the 127-yard sixth hole. Jeanette
Bush then aced No. 7 with an 83-yard shot before L.S. Wine
completed the run Oct. 27 with a 140-yard ace on No.8.
</P>
<P>
   __ Shark field set: The field has been finalized for next week's
Franklin Templeton Shark Shootout at Sherwood Country Club, where
12 two-man teams will compete for $1.3 million, including $320,000
for the winning team in the three-day competition.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Day was added to the field on Monday and will play with
newly crowned PGA Tour Championship winner Hal Sutton. Other teams
are Mark Calcavecchia-Andrew Magee, Fred Couples-Justin Leonard,
Jim Furyk-Scott Hoch, John Daly-Fuzzy Zoeller, Davis Love III-Brad
Faxon, Ben Crenshaw-Craig Stadler, Billy Andrade-Jay Haas, Tom
Kite-Billy Mayfair, Peter Jacobsen-John Cook, defending champions
Bruce Lietzke-Scott McCarron and Steve Elkington and tournament
host Greg Norman _ competing in his first event since undergoing
shoulder surgery in May.
</P>
<P>
   The traditionally low-scoring event, which includes
alternate-stroke, best-ball and scramble formats, runs Friday
through Sunday and benefits the National Childhood Cancer
Foundation and Interface.
</P>

UPGRADE NOT IN DANGER AT CSUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The resignation of Cal State Northridge athletic
director Paul Bubb and senior associate athletic director Judy
Brame won't affect the school's plans to upgrade its athletic
facilities, school president Blenda Wilson said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plans of the university to have a broad-based athletic
program, to have a football stadium, were back with the North
Campus task force,'' Wilson said. ``It's not a personal question
having to do with Paul as athletic director. It is a university
plan and intention.''
</P>
<P>
   However, site committee chairman David Honda said he plans to
ask Wilson for an extension on the site recommendation, which
Wilson set for Dec. 1. Wilson said she would honor a request for an
extension.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-member committee, which is expected to recommend CSUN
build a 12,000 to 15,000 seat stadium on the North Campus, needs to
meet one more time before it can finalize plans for the
recommendation, Honda said.
</P>
<P>
   Bubb was a member of the site committee, but Honda said it
wouldn't make sense for the committee to meet without sufficient
athletic representation. Before the site committee can meet again,
Honda said Bubb's replacement on the committee must be named.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaches, rightly, should be concerned about being represented
in the deliberation,'' Wilson said. ``And we would make sure,
either on an interim basis or long-term, depending on when the task
force wants to consider it, the coaches do get represented by
someone who knows their views and has their interests in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The site committee has met six times in an effort to identify
the best location, not only for a football field but for new
locations for a baseball field, a soccer field, a football practice
field and a recreation/intramural center.
</P>
<P>
   Honda echoed Wilson's sentiments about Bubb's resignation,
saying he didn't anticipate any long-term problems stemming from
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the committee, itself, is structured so that it
doesn't hurt,'' Honda said. ``We just have to postpone the report
until I can get another committee meeting.''

LIVENT DROPS TIMES SQUARE THEATER PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada) (sw) 
 By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three months after agreeing to redevelop the last
unclaimed historic theater on 42d Street, the financially troubled
Canadian production giant Livent Inc. announced on Wednesday that
it was dropping the project.
</P>
<P>
   Livent officials said that the plan for the Times Square
Theater, which was to include a 500-seat theater, a restaurant and
shops, no longer seemed like a prudent investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The option we signed in August provided us the opportunity to
analyze in detail the ambitious and creative, multi-use plan that
we had developed,'' Livent's chief executive, Roy Furman, said in a
statement, ``and we determined that our proposal did not deliver
sufficient returns for the company.'' Reached at his home on
Wednesday night, Furman declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Toronto-based company, whose projects
include rebuilding the Ford Theater next door to the Times Square
and staging ``Ragtime'' there, declined to say whether Wednesday's
decision stemmed from Livent's recent financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after agreeing to redevelop the theater in August,
Livent's board ousted the company's founder, Garth Drabinsky, after
executives said they had discovered inflated revenues and other
financial irregularities in the company's books. Trading of the
company's stock, which was listed on the Nasdaq and Toronto
exchanges, has been halted since then. New York state officials had
said they expected the project would require Livent to invest at
least $36 million.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the New 42d Street, the nonprofit redevelopment
agency that controls the Times Square Theater and that signed the
agreement with Livent, said other groups were interested in the
88-year-old landmark, but declined to name them.
</P>
<P>
   In August, New 42d Street chose Livent's proposal over a more
lucrative one from the World Wrestling Federation, which had
proposed building a restaurant and store with a professional
wrestling theme, saying it preferred to have another live theater
on 42d Street. Other proposals, real estate executives said at the
time, included a comedy club called the Laugh Factory and a
restaurant called Empire! with a Roman gladiator theme.
</P>
<P>
   The Times Square, on the north side of 42d Street just west of
Seventh Avenue, is the only one of the seven historic 42d Street
theaters between Seventh and Eighth avenues that is still
available.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the Walt Disney Co. reopened the New Amsterdam Theater
near Seventh Avenue. Across the street, the New 42d Street
installed a nonprofit children's theater at the New Victory Theater
and is building a small theater and rehearsal studio. The nonprofit
Roundabout Theater Co. plans to move into the nearby Selwyn
Theater.
</P>
<P>
   And last year Livent, whose productions have collectively won 18
Tony Awards, combined the old Lyric and Academy theaters to create
the Ford Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Livent's financial future remains up in the air. The company has
promised to issue revised financial statements by no later than the
end of next week, a process that company executives said has been
slowed by a suit filed in September by Drabinsky that is aimed at
stopping an investigation by the accounting firm KPMG Canada.

CONSERVATIVE VOTERS SAT OUT ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By RAMON G. MCLEOD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Conservative Republican voters are supposed to be the surest of
sure bets to vote, especially in a low-turnout election. But
Tuesday, plenty of them apparently stayed home.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, those voters who are among the most attuned to
the Republican message _ older voters and people with high incomes
_ failed to deliver the big margins needed by the top of the
ticket. Instead, they turned out to be just as likely to vote for
Democrats Gray Davis and Barbara Boxer as they were for Republicans
Dan Lungren and Matt Fong, according to exit polls and turnout
data.
</P>
<P>
   Voter turnout in California was about what pollsters had
predicted. It appears that about 8.8 to 8.9 million California
votes were cast in the election, roughly 42 to 43 percent of
eligible citizens or 59 percent of registered voters. That is not
bad compared with the rest of the country, where only about 36 to
38 percent of eligible adults turned out, but it is down from 1994,
when 47 percent turned out here.
</P>
<P>
   This modest turnout should have been a plus for the GOP. Yet a
closer look at California's results shows how bad it was for
Republicans, especially Lungren, even in their traditional
strongholds.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when Lungren ran for attorney general in 1994, he
pulled 451,700 votes in Orange County. Wednesday, in one of the
most conservative counties in the state, he drew just 328,000
votes, with some absentee votes still to be counted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conservatives may simply have been battle-weary and
uninspired. There was no Ronald Reagan or Bruce Herschensohn to
inspire them,'' said Republican campaign consultant Ken Khachigian.
``We didn't shape our issues either. Basically we let them set the
agenda, and once we did, we were done.''
</P>
<P>
   That agenda was a fairly simple one: Take a moderate
conservative approach on issues like crime, the death penalty and
welfare and a liberal stance on social issues like abortion, the
environment, gays and guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``For whatever personal problems President Clinton has, he has
to be given credit as the one who led the way in convincing
Democrats _ especially in California _ that they had to move to the
middle on some of their core issues,'' said Mark Baldassare, survey
director at the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``The GOP simply has not understood this and are identified with
their core supporters, those on the hard right. That makes it easy
for Democrats to paint them as extremists, and Californians don't
want extremists.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats probably would have won the governorship even if
the Republicans' conservative base had come out in force. There are
not enough conservative voters in California to cover the 20-point
margin of victory that Davis brought in.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, conservatives make up about 33 percent of the
electorate, and slightly more than that in off-year elections in
California.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, the Voter News Service exit poll showed that they
made up only about 30 percent of the voters. That could increase a
bit when absentee ballots are completely tallied, but most analysts
believe that even with those added ballots there is ample evidence
that a lot of conservatives stayed home.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was that the Republican candidates at the top of the
ticket also were unattractive to moderates. Davis, for example, won
among self-described moderates by nearly 2 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polling revealed that voters were far more concerned with
issues than ideology.
</P>
<P>
   For example, education was the issue that mattered most to the
greatest number of voters, cited by 19 percent as their top
priority. Abortion was second, cited by 16 percent, followed by the
economy or jobs, and taxes. The environment and gun control trailed
in single digits.
</P>
<P>
   Only 9 percent of the voters polled in California by the Voters
New Service said the White House sex scandal was the issue that
mattered most to them.
</P>
<P>
   About 75 percent of the California voters surveyed were white,
12 percent Hispanic, 7 percent African American, 4 percent Asian
American and 2 percent other minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, citizen participation was about 36 percent or 37
percent, down slightly from 38.4 percent in 1994, analysts said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Latino and African American voting was way up in many states,
and according to exit polls, blacks may have almost doubled their
participation compared with 1994. In New York, Comptroller Carl
McCall, an African American, had a virtual lock in his re-election
bid. But his race was used as a draw to get black voters to the
polls, where they ended up supporting Democratic U.S. Rep. Charles
Schumer in his bid to unseat Republican U.S. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato,
said Robert Shapiro, a Columbia University political analyst.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, African American voters were drawn to the
polls by a little-noticed but emotional ballot issue, a statewide
referendum to scrap a constitutional provision banning mixed-race
marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Voters at both ends of the political spectrum also were put off
when incumbent Republican Governor David Beasley pledged and then
reneged on his promise two years ago to remove the state's
Confederate-era battle flag from the statehouse in Columbia.
Beasley was defeated by Democrat Jim Hodges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats are back, because this state is tired of the
divisive politics of race and sex,'' South Carolina Democratic
Party Chairman Dick Harpootlian said, adding that the Democrats
would ``bring justice and progress'' to the state.
</P>
<P>
   In the days leading up to Tuesday's voting, Clinton urged
Democrats in a campaign appearance at a predominantly black west
Baltimore church not to fall victim to low voter turnout that
typically benefits the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton traveled to Maryland to endorse Democratic incumbent
Governor Parris Glendening, who defeated Ellen Sauerbrey for the
second time in an election that turned in part on Glendening's
attacks on Sauerbrey's record on civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the threat to videotape polling places in key
minority districts, a North Carolina Republican push to promote
absentee ballots among conservative voters also may have backfired
by energizing minority voters, Democratic campaign aide Don Baker
said.
</P>
<P>
   Baker directed the re-election campaign of U.S. Rep. Mel Watt.
Running in a congressional district that has been redrawn three
times this decade because of gerrymandering, Watt on Tuesday became
the first black elected in a majority white district in North
Carolina since Reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of things in North Carolina going on where
the Republicans kind of shot themselves in the feet,'' Baker said.
``(The Republicans) just overplayed their hands and people felt
threatened, personally threatened.''

GINGRICH TAKES HEAT FROM GOP 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC SANDALOW  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Stunned by their poor performance in Tuesday's
elections, Republicans Wednesday openly questioned their commitment
to impeachment proceedings and their devotion to House Speaker Newt
Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Although neither appeared likely to become immediate casualties
of the midterm vote, frustrated Republicans pointed fingers at each
other and displayed a deep anxiety that has been absent since they
won control of Congress in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican revolution has run out of steam,'' said Rep.
Frank Riggs, R-Windsor, who is retiring from the House at the end
of this year. ``The person who has to take responsibility for that
. . . is Newt Gingrich. I think he lost touch with our party's
base.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans maintained control of Congress, but fell far short
of expectations. Democrats picked up five House seats, giving
Republicans a narrow 223-to-211 majority, with one independent. In
the Senate, Democrats and Republicans swapped three seats,
preserving the GOP's 55-to-45 seat advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich accepted blame for the election results at a glum
post-election news conference in his home district.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I'm the speaker, so I'll take responsibility,'' Gingrich
said. ``We should probably have aggressively pushed cutting taxes
and saving Social Security much harder than we did this year.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Gingrich was speaking, members were already talking
among themselves about finding a new leader. California Rep. David
Dreier, R-San Dimas (Los Angeles County), took two calls at home
from fellow members who wanted to know whether there was truth to
the rumor that he was going to take on the speaker.
</P>
<P>
   The answer was no, but the question underscored the
behind-the-scenes maneuvering that began even before the last votes
were counted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all concerned,'' said Dreier, a close ally of the
speaker. ``But to conclude that getting rid of Gingrich would be a
panacea is a real stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich drew the ire of conservative House members last month
when he and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., negotiated
a budget compromise with President Clinton that included large
increases in spending and no tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich had soothed lawmakers by reassuring them that anger
over Clinton would motivate Republican voters to come to the polls
on election day, and that negotiating with the president was the
best way to prevent a government shutdown and alienating moderate
voters. Instead, Tuesday's vote marked the first time since 1934,
and only the second time since the Civil War, that the party in
control of the White House picked up seats during a midterm
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a serious miscalculation,'' Riggs said. ``A sizable
portion of our base was demoralized by what they saw as a craven
compromise on the budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreier hinted that there may be some significant shakeups, but
he predicted that Gingrich will retain his speakership when
Republicans meet in two weeks to pick leaders for the next
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The most frequently discussed challengers are conservative Reps.
Steve Largent, R-Okla., and David McIntosh, R-Ind., but both are
considered longshots to topple the man who led Republicans to their
first majority in nearly 50 years. House Appropriations Chairman
Bob Livingston, R-La., has expressed an interest in becoming
speaker after Gingrich leaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the people who normally are quoted (as potential
threats) are people who would in fact take the party to a narrower
base with fewer members,'' Gingrich said Wednesday as he predicted
that he would retain his post.
</P>
<P>
   Lott also acknowledged disappointment with the results but said
he expects no challenges to the leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The next task facing Congress is nothing less urgent than an
impeachment inquiry of Clinton. A House subcommittee has scheduled
hearings to begin Monday, and the full Judiciary Committee is
expected to conduct hearings as early as Nov. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said that among the lessons of Tuesday's vote is that
Americans are tired of what House Democratic Leader Richard
Gephardt of Missouri termed the GOP's ``obsession with
impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost as if they're saying collectively: `Enough
already! Enough! Bring it to an end,''' Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde said the vote
would not affect his yet-to-be announced hearing schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee continues to have a clear constitutional duty to
complete its work in a fair and expeditious manner,'' Hyde said in
a written statement. ``This was just as true before the election as
it is today.''
</P>
<P>
   However, many Republicans said members are keenly aware of the
political risks of continuing down a path that appears to be
unpopular with voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans are not enthusiastic about pursuing this,'' said
Dreier.
</P>
<P>
   He said the GOP's beating at the polls makes it more likely than
ever that the hearings will be finished by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message from the election is `get it over with,''' said
GOP political consultant Paul Manafort.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was careful not to gloat when reporters asked whether he
believed that the Democratic gains would have any impact on the
impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a decision for (Congress) to make,'' the president
said. ``If you look at all the results, they're clear and
unambiguous: The American people want their business, their
concerns, their children, their families, their future addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated Republicans on opposite sides of the political
spectrum were left to blame each other for the disappointing
results.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the religious right continues to dominate the party in
2000, we will not only lose the White House yet again, we will
probably lose the Congress,'' said Richard Tafel of the Log Cabin
Republicans, a gay GOP group.
</P>
<P>
   Hours earlier, some conservative members blamed Republican
losses on candidates, like California's Matt Fong, who refused to
speak out strongly enough on issues important to the religious
right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fong (is) a self-proclaimed moderate Republican,'' said Randy
Tate, executive director of the Christian Coalition. ``He blurred
the line (on abortion), so he didn't fare well. Running away from
those issues doesn't help.''

CONNERLY EXULTS AT NEW AFFIRMATIVE ACTION BAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By LOUIS FREEDBERG  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    WASHINGTON _ On the same day that voters in Washington State
voted to legalize the medical use of marijuana and raise the
minimum wage, they also followed California's lead and voted to
abolish affirmative action.
<TEXT>
<P>
   By so doing, they gave a big boost to a sputtering movement led
by University of California Regent Ward Connerly to abolish
affirmative action across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two down and 48 to go,'' said a jubilant Connerly, who
attended the victory celebrations in Seattle on Tuesday night after
the passage of Initiative 200, a close copy of Proposition 209
approved by California voters in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Washington became only the second state to eliminate
state-supported forms of affirmative action as a result of a
statewide initiative. ``It sends a message to both the Democratic
and Republican parties that this movement has legs,'' said
Connerly, who provided both financial and strategic assistance for
the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Since the passage of Proposition 209, the fight against
affirmative action had failed to demonstrate the momentum many had
predicted. Voters in Houston defeated an anti-affirmative action
ballot measure, organizers in Florida failed to gather enough
signatures to place a Proposition 209 clone on the ballot, and
Republicans in Congress balked at abolishing affirmative action in
contracting and hiring by federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of a court ruling, Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi
have been forced to phase out the use of race or gender in
admissions to public colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   The passage of Initiative 200, by a healthy 58 percent to 42
percent vote, was a discouraging blow to supporters of affirmative
action because it occurred in a state that is heavily Democratic
and in which ``preferences'' had hardly been a high-profile issue.
</P>
<P>
   It also passed in the face of a fierce $4 million campaign to
defeat it, in which proponents were outspent by a 4-to-1 ratio.
``It was a setback, to be sure,'' said Hugh Price, executive
director of the National Urban League.
</P>
<P>
   But the effect of initiatives like those in Washington and
California, he said, will be muted by the fact that most major
corporations and universities are committed to the principle of
diversity. They are likely to continue to reach out to African
Americans and other minorities, even if they do not always use
formal affirmative action programs to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know of no corporation or university that wants to go
backwards on this issue,'' he said. ``The tools for accomplishing
diversity and inclusion may change, but the fundamental objective
is as sound as ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Eva Paterson, executive director of the Lawyers Committee for
Civil Rights in San Francisco and one of the leaders of the
campaign against Proposition 209, said she too was disappointed at
the Washington vote. ``I had hoped that the more progressive trend
we saw in California on Tuesday would go northward.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, she said she doubted that the Washington vote
presages a national movement to abolish affirmative action _ in
large part because Republicans will be unlikely to want to alienate
Latino and Asian voters whom they now recognize are critical to
winning at the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Republicans proceed down this affirmative action road,
they are going to reap a bitter harvest in the year 2000,'' she
said. ``Republicans are not stupid. My reading of this week's polls
is that they will need the Hispanic vote.''
</P>
<P>
   But Connerly said that his strategy is to rely on voters, not
state legislatures or Congress, in the effort to abolish
affirmative action. ``I don't think there is a legislative body in
the nation willing to go the distance on this issue,'' said
Connerly, who said he was eying Nebraska for the next
anti-affirmative action drive.
</P>
<P>
   Other opponents of affirmative action noted that while they may
have suffered some setbacks, most court rulings have gone in their
favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that politically things did not go as well as we
would have liked, but we have continued to win significant
victories in court,'' said Roger Clegg, general counsel for the
Center for Equal Opportunity, an anti-affirmative organization in
Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that even in Houston, a judge has ruled that former
Houston mayor Bob Lanier acted improperly in changing the wording
of the ballot measure to make it more likely that voters would
reject the measure. Voters will now have a chance to vote on it
again sometime next year.``This is a fight that is going to be
fought on a lot of different fronts, over a long period of time,''
he said.

PALEONTOLOGISTS PONDER PARROT PARADOX 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID PERLMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    When the dinosaurs died in the Great Extinction some 65 million
years ago, most other animals vanished too, but some survived.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And now it appears that parrots, the most intelligent of all
birds, were among the luckiest ones: They thrived while the
dinosaurs were dying, although their own avian ancestors
mysteriously never made it through the long disaster. And no one
knows why.
</P>
<P>
   The puzzle now deepens with the work of a Berkeley
paleontologist who has identified a tiny fossil that is 65 to 70
million years old and is the earliest known fossil of a modern land
bird.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas A. Stidham, a University of California graduate student,
found the half-inch fragment of jawbone while he was hunting for a
thesis subject among the collections in the University of
California at Berkeley Museum of Paleontology, where it had been
lying in a drawer, unidentified for decades and labeled only as
``unknown avian fossil.''
</P>
<P>
   Stidham quickly identified the half-inch fragment as the lower
part of a parrot's jawbone, which in modern birds is covered by the
horny material that forms the bird's beak. X-ray analysis found
tracks of nerves and blood vessels in the fossil bone that are
identical to modern parrots, and it probably came from a bird about
the size of a modern macaw, Stidham said.
</P>
<P>
   Although parrots and other modern birds are toothless, their
ancestors, like the fabled Archaeopteryx that lived as long as 150
million years ago, were armed with rows of sharp teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Those toothed birds were the dominant flying beasts before the
Cretaceous period, when toothless birds like Stidham's parrot
gradually took over the skies. Like the dinosaurs, the birds with
teeth failed to survive the mass extinction when a monstrous
asteroid collided with the Earth and darkened the skies for
thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
   The fossil jawbone fragment was first unearthed in the early
1960s by UC paleontologist William Clemens while he was excavating
in an old fossil-rich river deposit in eastern Wyoming. Clemens is
now Stidham's graduate adviser and in a comment on the work
Wednesday, Clemens said:
</P>
<P>
   ``While modern birds survived the Cretaceous, more primitive
birds with teeth became extinct. This heightens the mystery
surrounding an explanation for the extinctions at the end of the
Cretaceous. It's not clear why some animals survived and others
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Stidham's report on the fossil is published Thursday in the
British scientific journal Nature.

 &HT;    Economist predicts U.S. growth will slow
 &HT;    By Kirk Ladendorf
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Economist Sung Won Sohn has nightmares of
another round of international financial crises that could send the
U.S. economy into a recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today the world is in trouble,'' said Sohn, senior vice
president and chief economist for Norwest Corp. of Minneapolis,
Minn. ``This is the greatest challenge to the world economy since
the Great Depression. Forty percent of the world's economy already
is in recession.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's how Sohn thinks it could play out:
</P>
<P>
   Brazil, heavily indebted and hurt by falling commodity prices,
is forced to devalue its currency.
</P>
<P>
   That triggers investor concerns and another round of
devaluations from vulnerable countries in Latin America and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Then China, with its own enormous economic problems, devalues.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, then the United States will have a difficult
time staying out of recession in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   How likely is such a scenario? Sohn, speaking to a group of
Austin business people at the Renaissance Hotel Wednesday,
estimated there's a 20 percent to 25 percent chance that a
recession will hit the the United States next year.
</P>
<P>
   The more likely result, he said, is that U.S. economic growth
could slow noticeably to less than 2 percent in 1999. That compares
with a projected rate of 3 percent for 1998 and a rate of 3.8
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The slowdown will be felt in Austin, he said. Job growth will
slow to 2.4 percent, its lowest expansion in the 1990s and down
from 4 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Austin, Sohn said, will be held back by continuing Asian
economic problems and by the increased difficulty its high-tech
companies have in attracting skilled workers.
</P>
<P>
   Not enough skilled workers are being trained, Sohn said, and
Austin will have a harder time importing them from elsewhere in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The labor shortage extends from sea to shining sea,'' Sohn
said. ``People don't have to move to Austin to find high-paying
jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Sohn, who traveled to Latin America in September to assess the
region's economic performance, believes the area remains extremely
vulnerable to currency devaluation and a restructuring of its
massive foreign debt, some of which is held by New York banks.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does Sohn expect any quick rebound in Asia, contrary to some
predictions from Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   He believes the economies of Asia will remain weak for the next
three to four years as they tackle fundamental reforms in the midst
of a credit crunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty grave situation,'' he said in an interview after
his speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I hear about Wall Street pundits saying things have
stabilized and will rebound very shortly, I know they don't
understand what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Sohn's forecast for the coming year includes:
</P>
<P>
   _ Another, longer-lasting correction in the stock market that
will erode some of the enormous wealth this country has accumulated
during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   _ Another rate cut by the Federal Reserve Board _ probably
one-quarter of a percentage point _ before the end of this year.
That won't bolster the stock market much, because investors already
expect it. _ But lower rates may not spur the economy much because
lenders have become far more wary of potential risks. They are
tightening their loan standards, which limits the ability of many
businesses to expand.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what Norwest Bancorp. economist Sung Won Sohn thinks
might happen in 1999:
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. economy: It will grow at a less than 2 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
   Chances of recession: 20 percent to 25 percent in the U.S. and
50 percent in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Austin's growth: 2.4 percent growth, down from 4 percent. He
calls it a ``soft landing.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin homes: Softening demand for homes between ``affordable''
and $1 million. Demand remains strong for homes $1 million and
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Semiconductor industry: It won't make a strong recovery until
2001.

 &HT;    Chocolate may help you bulk up, but it won't add to acne
 &HT;    By Karen Collins
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Does what someone eats affect acne?
</P>
<P>
   A: Usually not. You may have heard people say that chocolate or
high-fat diets make acne worse, but studies do not support such
contentions.
</P>
<P>
   Some people have tried taking high doses of zinc or vitamin A
supplements to treat acne, but generally without success. The form
of vitamin A called RetinA used to treat acne is applied to the
skin surface; neither vitamin A nor beta carotene work when taken
internally. Besides being ineffective against acne, high doses of
zinc can inhibit the absorption of copper and cause other negative
effects, so experts discourage supplements beyond the RDA.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the best way to eat for someone who has trouble
putting weight on?
</P>
<P>
   A: Whether in a person is recovering from weight lost during
illness or simply fromhas a desire to ``bulk up'' a bit more, body
fat that has slipped too low can be increased by simply taking in
more calories from any source. But to make weight gain come mostly
from muscle takes a combination of diet and strength training
exercise (lifting weights, using strength-training machines, or
doing resistance-type exercises).
</P>
<P>
   Since muscle is made from protein, a healthy weight-gaining diet
needs amounts beyond standard recommendations (though actually less
than many Americans eat), but also plenty of carbohydrate (fruits,
vegetables and grain products). Eat three meals and one to three
snacks each day.
</P>
<P>
   Boost calories by choosing larger portions and foods
concentrated in calories and nutrients (such as raisins and other
dried fruit, juice, ``starchy'' vegetables lsuch as potatoes and
com, and milk with instant breakfast or powdered milk added to it).
</P>
<P>
   Q: How long can I store breast milk that I've pumped?
</P>
<P>
   A: Breast milk can be stored at room temperature for about four
hours, but try to refrigerate it as soon as possible. In the
refrigerator, it will remain safe to feed your baby for about 48
hours.
</P>
<P>
   You can also freeze breast milk for up to three months, provided
your freezer has a separate door from your refrigerator (and thus
maintains a very cold temperature). Frozen milk can be thawed by
simply placing it in the refrigerator or by placing it in a cup of
warm water; use it within 24 hours of thawing.
</P>
<P>
   Congratulations on making the effort to provide breast milk for
your baby _ breastfeeding is continues to receive more and more
attention for the many benefits it offers infants, even if babies
receive it for only for a few months or for some of their feedings.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does gelatin make fingernails grow better?
</P>
<P>
   A: Fingernails, like hair, are made out of protein. If someone
is not eating enough protein or calories, fingernails may be weak
and break easily.
</P>
<P>
   Gelatin is not a good way to meet protein needs, however,
because it is an ``incomplete'' protein: iIt does not contain all
the amino acid building blocks of protein that our bodies need. For
someone who is getting enough protein and calories, adding gelatin
to the diet has not been shown to affect fingernails.
</P>
<P>
   For someone who is well-nourished, the main reason that nails
get weak and break easily is that they dry out easily when exposed
to difficult weather or long soaks in water (as in dishwashing or
swimming). Try protecting hands during washing chores to see if it
benefits your nails.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard that grapefruit juice can interact dangerously with
some medicines. Is this true?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Grapefruit and grapefruit juice inactivate a body enzyme
involved in the breakdown of a growing list of drugs, resulting in
higher-than-expected drug levels in the body and possibly serious
side effects. For example, the Canadian pharmacologist who
discovered this interaction says that taking one tablet of the
cholesterol-lowering medicine lovastatin with a glass of grapefruit
juice is like taking 12 to 15 tablets with water. Even one cup of
grapefruit juice produces these effects, which last for 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Besides lovastatin, some of the other medications found to
interact this way include terfenadine (Seldane), certain
anticonvulsants and antianxiety agents called benzodiazepines, a
heartburn medicine called cisapride (Propulsid), and some (but not
all) of a class of drugs called calcium channel blockers used to
control blood pressure and angina. Unfortunately this information
is only beginning to be known, so if you like grapefruit (a very
nutritious food), check with both your physician and pharmacist
about possible interactions with any medicines you take.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do the little machines that look like calculators that people
attach to their arms measure body fat accurately?
</P>
<P>
   A: What you describe sounds like bioelectrical impedence
equipment. The idea is to pass a very low electrical current
through the body, and because electricity passes through different
body tissue at different rates, flow is measured and entered into a
formula that is supposed to calculate the amount of lean versus fat
body tissue.
</P>
<P>
   The theory behind this technology is considered quite sound.
However, studies show that the same person could get different
readings depending on his or her body position, whether or not he
or she had eaten in the past five hours, the calculation formula
used, and the particular piece of equipment and where it is
attached to the body.
</P>
<P>
   These Ask a Dietitian questions were answered by Karen Collins,
M.S., R.D. of the American Institute for Cancer Research.

 &HT;    Round Rock man builds world's largest puzzle
 &HT;    By Pamela LeBlanc
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It stands 7 feet 4 inches high, weighs 506
pounds, breaks down into 209 pieces and would take most people
hours to put back together.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Pieczynski can assemble the enormous geometric puzzle that
dominates the living room of his Round Rock home in 30 minutes,
provided he's got a couple of volunteers to help him hold the
framework. Now the toolmaker, who designed and built the puzzle as
an entry in an international woodworking competition 16 years ago,
hopes the sculpture will make the next edition of ``The Guinness
Book of Records.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think it's strange and eccentric,'' he said.
``When I was a kid, my parents would buy me toys and I'd pull them
apart rather than play with them.''
</P>
<P>
   It took Pieczynski about 1,000 hours to build the monster
puzzle, a six-sided geometrically symmetrical structure with
interlocking pieces. He's hoping it will persuade Guinness to open
a new record category _ largest and heaviest 3-dimensional puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the company has asked him to submit a videotape and
more documentation. But with 50 to 100 proposals submitted to
Guinness every week, he's got stiff competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God, we get so many requests per year,'' said John
Hansen, research manager for Guinness Media Inc., which keeps about
10,000 records on its database and publishes about 4,000 in its
annual book.
</P>
<P>
   Pieczynski hopes to stake his claim somewhere between the
largest jigsaw puzzle _ 51,484 square feet and 43,924 pieces _ and
the largest crossword puzzle _ 82,951 squares and 38.28 square
feet.
</P>
<P>
   He should know by early December if he makes the database,
Hansen said. The editorial staff in London then will choose which
records are printed in the next book, due out in September 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Pieczynski, 40, made his first geometric puzzle 23 years ago in
high school shop class. Since then he's crafted dozens of smaller,
foot-high puzzles from acrylic, aluminum, brass and hardwood.
</P>
<P>
   Crumble one into a heap of 200 or so tiny, nearly identical
pieces, and he'll transform it into a sculpture in six or seven
minutes. An impressive feat, considering most of the 328 notches on
one particular puzzle must be aligned before they slide together in
the final step.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hard? It depends if you have a Ph.D.,'' he said. ``There is a
pattern that needs to be discovered.''
</P>
<P>
   Pieczynski said he designs puzzles in his sleep, sometimes
waking up in the wee hours to sketch blueprints for them. He uses
no computer to design the pieces.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I have a new idea, it's the finished product I see
first,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know if it's physically possible or not.''
</P>
<P>
   He used a Sears Craftsman radial arm saw to cut the giant puzzle
pieces, which range in size from 6 to 52.5 inches. Someday, he
would like to see the piece _ which he estimates is worth $30,000
to $40,000 _ displayed in public, perhaps in the lobby of a
high-tech company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything he does is very precise and exact,'' said Joe's
wife, Colette Pieczynski. ``It's part of his personality.''

 &HT;    Signed, sealed and devoured
 &HT;    By Jan Norris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The mall. The traffic. The crowds. And
that infernal Have a Holly, Jolly Christmas over the loudspeakers.
Just the thought of gathering enough energy for holiday shopping is
enough to send some of us scurrying for mail-order catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike clothes or gadgets, food gifts fit almost any recipient _
everybody eats. But you can personalize your gift _ deliver a taste
of a hometown left behind (rugelah from New York City) or
adventuresome flavors of a favorite city (spicy El Paso Co. salsas
from Texas). Give buffet foods such as ham or cheese to lift the
party spirits of a harried host. Sugarless and lowfat jams will do
dieters proud.
</P>
<P>
   For certain recipients, food is a practical gift. Many older
people who have smaller homes and all they need to equip them are
grateful for presents that can be consumed.
</P>
<P>
   But how do you choose among the food catalogs that are growing
by the bushelful as this type of gift-giving gains popularity?
</P>
<P>
   We did some homework for you. Last month, we phoned in orders
for several gift foods from different sources and catalogs. We
noted delivery times, and then tasted the foods.
</P>
<P>
   It's an expensive venture _ and the smaller the order, the
larger the percentage of delivery cost. We kept that in mind while
weighing flavor and delivery.
</P>
<P>
   A note about our research: I ordered all foods as gifts, never
revealing my affiliation with The Palm Beach Post. The charges were
put on a credit card, and I received bills separately from the
foods. All of the phone representatives were polite and helpful. We
tracked delivery time, but note that this is not crunch time just
before the major holidays. Most companies have cutoff dates between
Dec. 5 and Dec. 21 for Christmas Day delivery; there is a two-day
rush delivery available from most of the firms at an extra charge.
</P>
<P>
   The foods were photographed as they were sent, except for the
ginger-spice cake, which we baked from a mix, and the cheesecake,
which was sliced. Staff members helped me taste the foods, and gave
their opinions on flavor and whether they would consider giving
them as a gift.
</P>
<P>
   El Paso Chile Co. dips
</P>
<P>
   The cost: $15 ($10 for three jars, and $5 freight).
</P>
<P>
   The source: El Paso Chile Company, 909 Texas St., El Paso, Texas
79901. (915) 544-3434.
</P>
<P>
   Delivery: Two-day delivery. One jar had a loose seal, however,
and the contents were spoiled. The representative was polite when
called about the problem. Jar was reordered, but had not arrived in
a week.
</P>
<P>
   Flavor: The two that were intact, two olive roasted garlic salsa
and the white bean dip, rated high _ not too spicy or bland.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: $5 per jar (11.5 to 16 ounces) isn't too pricey for
the quality. Order these for party hosts, football watchers or
ex-Texans.
</P>
<P>
   Divine Delights Pumpkin Teacake and Christmas petit fours and
truffles
</P>
<P>
   The cost: $61.65 for all. $27.95 for truffles; $23.75 for
pumpkin teacake and $9.95 freight.
</P>
<P>
   The source: Divine Delights, 24 Digital Drive, Suite 10, Novato,
Calif. 94949; phone (800) 443-2836.
</P>
<P>
   Delivery: Six-day delivery. Flavor: Our tasters were tongue-tied
thinking of superlative adjectives to describe these attractive
chocolate and candy morsels. The chocolates were incredibly creamy
and the pumpkin teacake was moist and tasty with a good spice
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: The dozen chocolates and petit fours may seem
pricey, but they're a bargain compared to other gourmet chocolates.
The teacake ad says it serves eight, but we got 16 servings easily
from it. It also seems a good buy. We'd love to receive these
ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   Scharffen Berger Chocolate Home Chef Bar
</P>
<P>
   The cost: $24 _ $9 per bar (2 bars, 9.7 ounces each), $6
shipping.
</P>
<P>
   The source: Scharffen Berger Chocolates, 250 S. Maple Ave., Unit
C, South, San Francisco, Calif. 94080. (650) 866-3300.
</P>
<P>
   Delivery: Four-day delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Flavor: The bittersweet bars are billed as ``artisan'' chocolate
_ made in small batches with premium ingredients, and the cocoa
bean flavor when used in cooking and baking is superior.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: This is plain-Jane on the outside. Only experienced
cooks would know of its reputation. However, recipes and concise
methods for cooking with the chocolate are included. This is a gift
for gourmet cooks or bakers. Those who buy it as a gift of fine
chocolate for eating may be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Beth's Cake Mixes: Lemon, Chocolate and Spice
</P>
<P>
   The cost: $18; $5 per mix, $3 shipping.
</P>
<P>
   The source: Beth's Fine Desserts, 1201 F. Andersen Drive, San
Rafael, Calif. 94901; phone (415) 485-1406.
</P>
<P>
   Delivery: Five-day delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Flavor: We baked the Heirloom Spice Cake as directed, and it
came out as pictured on the box. Tasters liked the crystalized
ginger pieces in and on top of the cake. Some said it was somewhat
dry, but all agreed the flavor was as good as a cake made from
scratch.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: These are superior to supermarket cake mixes, and
include bonus ingredients such as candied lemon zest or
crystallized ginger pieces. Each box is packed with a recipe card
giving low-fat and vegan (strict vegetarian) baking directions, as
well as another recipe for using the mix. Order these for
time-pressed cooks who enjoy baking, and want a ``from scratch''
taste.
</P>
<P>
   Biringer Farm Raspberry Shortbread
</P>
<P>
   The cost: $18.90; $12.95 for shortbread; $5.95 shipping.
</P>
<P>
   The source: Biringer Farm Products Inc., 3715 134th St. N.E.,
Marysville, Wash. 98271. Phone (800) 448-8212.
</P>
<P>
   Delivery: Six-day delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Flavor: We were evenly divided _ and passionate _ about this
product. Many said it tasted pasty and the texture was too soft,
with mundane raspberry filling. Others loved the buttery crust and
fresh-fruit tasting filling.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: This shortbread was a finalist in the most recent
Fancy Food Show where gift and boutique foods are exhibited. It was
one of the most attractive products we ordered. Unless you'd make
and ship your own shortbread, this is a fine alternative. A good
gift for a holiday host, or a household with children.
</P>
<P>
   The Best of New York City Rugelah
</P>
<P>
   The cost: 1 1/2-pound tin: $29.99, including $5 shipping.
</P>
<P>
   The source: The Best of New York City, 389 Broome St., New York,
N.Y., 10013. Phone (800) 538-5055.
</P>
<P>
   Delivery: Four-day delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Flavor: The cinnamon-raisin flavored cookie was mediocre,
drawing neither praise nor criticism.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: With only an average flavor, it's tough to justify
the almost $30 price. Better to go to a local bakery and pack your
own tin at about half the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Perfectly Sweet Sugar-Free Raspberry Swirl Cheesecake
</P>
<P>
   Simply Sweet Vanilla Flavored Sugar Substitute (Maltitol).
</P>
<P>
   The cost: $27.78: $16 for cheesecake; $4.50 for Simply Sweet;
$5.95 shipping and $1.33 sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   The source: Perfectly Sweet Inc., 2550 N.W. 72nd Ave., No. 318,
Miami, Fla. 33122. Phone (800) 815-0009.
</P>
<P>
   Delivery: Overnight delivery (this may change with holiday
ordering). Cheesecake was shrink-wrapped, with cold packs included.
</P>
<P>
   Flavor: The cheesecake was the big disappointment in our product
tasting. Most said it was sour or had an off-flavor, or left an
unpleasant aftertaste. They praised the texture, however. The
sweetener was a favorite for its honey-like texture and no overly
sweet aftertaste.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: The cake was crudely packaged, and somewhat
shriveled. As for Simply Sweet, this is the newest darling of the
chef set because it holds up in, and adds texture to, baked goods
like no dry sugar substitute. The company gets kudos for packing a
free sugarless cookbook and samples of other sugar-free products
with our order. We don't recommend the cake, but the sweetener is
first-rate.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Crab Bay Co. Soups: Crab Norfolk, Chesapeake Cioppino,
She-Crab Soup
</P>
<P>
   The cost: $28; $21.95 for three soups, plus $5.95 shipping.
</P>
<P>
   The source: Blue Crab Bay Co., P.O. Box 370, Onancock, Va.,
28417. Phone (757) 787-3602.
</P>
<P>
   Delivery: Arrived in five days.
</P>
<P>
   Flavor: The Crab Norfolk had a nice, smoky flavor, and enough
chunks of potatoes, onions and peppers to satisfy our tasters. You
can vary the consistency of the condensed soups by using milk,
cream or half-and-half.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: We'd buy this for the seafood lovers on our list.
</P>
<P>
   Natural Exotic Tropicals sugar-free jams
</P>
<P>
   The cost: $24.90; $19.95 for four 10-ounce jars, $4.95 shipping.
</P>
<P>
   The source: Natural Exotic Tropicals, 2780 E. Oakland Park
Blvd., Fort Lauderdale, Fla. 33306. Order through Cushman's Fruit
Co. in West Palm Beach, (561) 965-3535.
</P>
<P>
   Flavor: None of our tasters knew these condiments _ orange
marmalade, raspberry and strawberry jams _ were artificially
sweetened. They were bowled over by the intense fruit flavors;
raspberry and orange marmalade were favorites. (There's also a line
of regular jellies and marmalades in 10 flavors.)
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: These come in plain jars with attractive but
commercial labels. We recommend them, especially for those on
special diets.
</P>
<P>
   Trio of Baby Peppered Hams
</P>
<P>
   The cost: $55.75; $48 for three 2 1/2-pound hams, $7.75 for
shipping.
</P>
<P>
   The source: Williams-Sonoma Food Catalog, P.O. Box 7456, San
Francisco, Calif. 94120-7456; phone (800) 699-2297.
</P>
<P>
   Delivery: Two weeks (shipped from the ham company, not the
catalog store).
</P>
<P>
   Flavor: The ham was a winner for our tasters, who noted it was
very lean. The boneless hams are rolled in brown sugar then in
cracked pepper before smoking, giving them a tasty crust.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: The hams keep four weeks unopened in the fridge _ a

 &HT;    My dinner with Jesse
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It was at another newspaper in another
city. The P.R. people from Fox wondered if I wanted to interview an
actor in Predator, the new Schwarzenegger picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not particularly,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he's really interesting,'' they said. ``Maybe you've heard
of him. Jesse Ventura.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not Jesse `The Body' Ventura?'' I gasped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, uh, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, you must understand that I've been a stone wrestling fan
since the age of 10, when I paid good money ($3) at the Cleveland
Arena to see Lord Athol Layton stomp hell out of Fritz Von Erich,
the personification of goose-stepping Fascist evil.
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, Jesse the Body was one of my current favorites.
Such was my admiration for his flamboyance _ feather boas! _ his
insouciance _ long, dangling pierced earrings! _ that not only
would I interview Jesse, I'd throw him a dinner party at my house.
</P>
<P>
   My wife cooked shish kebabs and ordered two cases of Corona,
which her feminine intuition told her was his favorite beer. We
invited eight other wrestling aficionados over for dinner. I
regarded the confines of our smallish living room, juxtaposed it
against Jesse's size. I counseled all of our guests not to ask him
the Ultimate Wrestling Question: Is It Fake?
</P>
<P>
   Jesse arrived in a stretch limo with a couple of handlers. He
filled the door. He filled the room.
</P>
<P>
   He was cordial, he was exceedingly polite, he was smart. He knew
that people didn't expect men of his size and occupation to be
smart, so he was already one or two moves ahead in any chess match.
It was clear that he had his sights set on something besides
wrestling . . . not that there was anything wrong with that.
</P>
<P>
   He had some stories about working with Arnold Schwarzenegger,
but He was at pains to let people know that he wasn't a cartoon, he
just played one on TV. He talked about having been a Navy SEAL with
evident pride. And he obviously had some money issues with Vince
McMahon, the major domo of the World Wrestling Federation.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Vince had been good to him. ``One month of
the royalties from the `Jesse the Body' Action Figure bought me a
red Porsche,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He was interested in the larger arena. The subject of President
Reagan came up, then completing his less-than-stellar second term.
I got the impression that Jesse thought Reagan was
good-news-bad-news. I say ``got the impressio''n because Ventura
was a very decorous, almost circumspect man, not given to the wild
bravado of his ring personality.
</P>
<P>
   It was a perfectly delightful evening. It didn't surprise me at
all that he became a successful announcer for the WWF, and then
switched gears and careers and entered politics in Minnesota. And I
didn't laugh when he ran for governor, either; if a mediocre actor
can become president, why can't a good wrestler become a governor?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes, one other thing. He's no party animal. Jesse Ventura
ate one shish kebabs and nursed a single Corona for the entire
evening.

 &HT;    Ohio State running back tries to live up to Griffin name
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Kevin Griffin never dreamed of asking to wear
his famous uncle's No. 45 when he joined the Ohio State football
team four years ago. Sporting the Griffin name in football-crazed
Columbus would be difficult enough.
</P>
<P>
   As a wide-eyed freshman who aspired to be a running back just
like his Uncle Archie, he quickly became known as ``Archie
Griffin's nephew'' instead of Kevin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never really bugged me, per se,'' said Griffin, a senior on
the No. 1 Ohio State Buckeyes. ``But sometimes, you don't want to
always have people interviewing you because you're Archie Griffin's
nephew. You want to get your own interviews and do things on your
own merit. And you don't want your friends to say, `Well, he might
be doing this or that because he is Archie's nephew.' And people do
say that behind your back.''
</P>
<P>
   So Griffin tried to combat that the only way he knew how: by
working harder and proving he deserved his spot on the team.
</P>
<P>
   It was admittedly painful when the 5-10, 180-pound Griffin
learned that his spot would not be at running back like his
two-time Heisman Trophy winning uncle but as a reserve wide
receiver who played mostly on special teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember going to my uncle one time and talking about it,''
Griffin said. ``But the kind of person I am, my (attitude) was to
simply be the best at whatever you are. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a matter of accepting my role and being the best
at my role. And I think I've accomplished that to some degree.''
</P>
<P>
   OSU coach John Cooper thinks so, too. He's been so impressed
with Griffin's dedication and attitude that he named him captain of
special teams last season. Captain Griff, he calls him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin, he's a great example of what a team player is,'' Cooper
said. ``I'm sure he came in here thinking, 'I'm going to Ohio State
and I'm going to be the star running back; I'm going to be like my
Uncle Archie.' ``But he's a guy for whatever reason wasn't in the
picture at running back. So instead of hanging his head and pouting
and feeling sorry for himself, he looked at other ways to help
himself and help our football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Griffin: ``My body frame, I just could not put on enough
weight to be a Big Ten back and be able to take all that
punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Griffin didn't try to bulk up to become more of a force
at wide receiver and on special teams.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, with the help of the muscle-enhancing supplement
creatine, he gained about 10 pounds because he thought he'd be able
``to knock some people's heads off and make (ESPN's) SportsCenter
more often. But it just didn't work out.''
</P>
<P>
   The extra weight slowed him down, made him sluggish. His coaches
were not pleased. So he dropped back down to 180 and now he's doing
his best not to get his head knocked off. Already, he's had a
couple of scares.
</P>
<P>
   Against Minnesota, he collided head-on with teammate Central
McClellion trying to down an Ohio State punt near the goal line and
received five stitches in his brow. The next game against
Northwestern, he was knocked unconscious after colliding with a
blocker. ``Not knowing anything except for your name is a really
scary, scary feeling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What was equally frightening, he said, was dealing with the
after-affects of the moderate concussion, such as making ``silly''
mistakes like unknowingly placing the toothpaste under the sink
instead of its normal place in the medicine cabinet and stuttering
his speech.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches kept him out of last week's game against Indiana and
he's questionable for this week's home game vs. Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it's been a tough year and a tough college career,
Griffin said. But if he had to do it all over, he'd come to Ohio
State again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did have high expectations for myself,'' he said. ``I don't
want to say I'm disappointed . . . but it would be nice to have
been able to carry the ball a couple more times. But it has still
been the best four years of my life.''

 &HT;    Benigni's gentle fable finds humor in a hellish place
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Life Is Beautiful'' is one family's tale of Holocaust
hardship. But don't bring your Kleenex unless you cry when you
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Italian movie clown Roberto Benigni (``Johnny Stecchino,'' ``The
Monster'') wrote, directed and stars in this remarkable little
movie, which defies gravity. It refuses to be grave in the face of
the most inhuman acts of this century. It does so by bending the
truth, softening the reality of concentration-camp conditions.
</P>
<P>
   But even with its fablelike tone, this is a film with a touching
message about the resilient human spirit.
</P>
<P>
   It's just that Benigni chooses to send his message wrapped in a
cloud of mirth.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in the first hour, those expecting a descent into the
darkness of death camps may question whether they wandered into the
wrong theater. Despite moments of ominous foreshadowing, they'll
find themselves watching a charming romantic comedy.
Happy-go-lucky, childlike Jewish waiter Guido (Benigni) becomes
smitten with a schoolteacher named Dora (Nicoletta Braschi,
Benigni's wife and frequent co-star) and woos her shamelessly until
she agrees to marry him.
</P>
<P>
   We are entertained by a runaway, brakeless car, hat-swapping
shtick, Guido's battle of riddles with a German diner and a raw egg
destined to land on a grumpy bureaucrat's forehead. The seeds of
encroaching anti-Semitism seem relatively unimportant.
</P>
<P>
   But after Guido and Dora wed, have a child and open the
bookstore they long dreamed of, ``Life Is Beautiful'' makes an
abrupt, jarring detour. Guido and his son, Giosue (an adorable
Giorgio Cantarini), are rounded up by German soldiers and shipped
by boxcar to an unspecified camp, with Catholic Dora voluntarily
joining them.
</P>
<P>
   Once they arrive, Guido tells his son that the camp is just an
elaborate game. If he plays by the rules and earns enough points,
Giosue is assured he can take home a tank. Guido constructs an
entire alternate reality for the boy, allowing him to escape the
brutality _ at least in his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Benigni's depiction of the camp tries to work a similar trick on
the audience. Yes, most of his antics _ like a double-talk
translation of the German regulations _ would have had him shot on
the spot. Of course, Giosue would probably have been ripped out of
his arms the moment they arrived. Naturally, they couldn't have
wandered outside their barracks or broadcast a musical message to
Dora across the camp. But don't let the factual liberties get in
the way of your enjoyment of this fable.
</P>
<P>
   Although Benigni restrains himself from his usual slapstick
strengths, there are flashes of it. Early on, impersonating a
government inspector, he sneaks into Dora's school and turns a
lecture on racial superiority into inspired gibberish. There is a
lot of Charlie Chaplin in his physical manner and attitude, plus
the verbal agility _ in Italian, at least _ of a Danny Kaye.
</P>
<P>
   His weakness as a director is excessive reverence to his
writing. Both halves of the movie feel padded. We get the romantic
set-up and are ready to move forward long before Benigni is.
Similarly, the escapades in the camp become repetitive quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But even if sharper editing might have helped, ``Life Is
Beautiful'' is still a remarkable film. The history of the
Holocaust is made up of many individuals who did what they could to
stand up to the death machine, so why not a genial jokester who
laughs in its face?

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Did you vote for governor or gobernador?
 &HT;    (For release Nov. 8, 1998)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I must confess that I often bristle when, in the voting booth, I
find the ballot to be in English and Spanish. I also was disturbed
to read about a San Francisco judge ruling that English-deprived
absentee ballot voters there could vote again because the names of
seven candidates were not translated into the Chinese language.
</P>
<P>
   It has nothing to do, I kept telling myself, with anything I
might have against bilingualism, but it just irks me that the
people who have gained the right to vote are supposed to know
enough English to get along.
</P>
<P>
   I was looking at the ballot box differently than, say,
education.
</P>
<P>
   The United States Code is clear on the issue. It says that ``no
person can be accepted for naturalization who cannot demonstrate an
understanding of the English language, including an ability to
read, write, and speak words in ordinary usage in the English
language.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet we are looking at ballots, such as that which I faced in
Florida last week that lists, on the left side, the terminology
``Governor and Lieutenant Governor'' and on the right side
``Gobernador y Vicegobernador.'' Then it lists the candidates. Jeb
Bush, it turns out, is spelled the same way in Spanish as it is in
English. And how lingually-deprived do you have to be to not be
able to figure out that the word ``governor'' is close enough to
``gobernador'' to be understood?
</P>
<P>
   Do people who meet the requirements of the U.S. Code really need
that kind of help on a ballot?
</P>
<P>
   It was when I delved into the muck of constitutional questions
on the ballot that I began to retreat from what I thought was an
entrenched position.
</P>
<P>
   The language of Florida's Constitutional Revision No. 13:
</P>
<P>
   ``Miscellaneous Matters and Technical Revisions: Removes
gender-specific references; allows prison sentences in
court-martial actions; consolidates ethics code provisions;
specifies time for veto message consideration; clarifies that
legislature gives designated officials final general appropriations
bills 72 hours before passage....'' And on and on it went; 10 lines
of varied actions, none have to do with one another.
</P>
<P>
   Who can understand this, I asked myself. In English, I was
having a tough time with it, and several other of the 13
constitutional revision questions on the Florida ballot.
</P>
<P>
   To the right, the revision was repeated in Spanish and I doubt
that too many Spanish-reading voters could get a firm grip on the
mumbo-jumbo, either. That's when my anti-bilingual ballot position
changed.
</P>
<P>
   I still feel that, if you passed into U.S. citizenship, you
certainly can read the name Jeb Bush, or Bill Clinton on the ballot
without it having to be interpreted for you, either into another
language or alphabet.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to written issues such as new bond questions,
constitutional revisions, local charter changes, that perhaps _ if
English isn't your first language _ you might need some help.
</P>
<P>
   I still don't understand why people in San Francisco need to see
the candidates' names in Chinese; can they possibly have met the
requirements of citizenship and, yet, still be incapable of reading
a person's name in our alphabet?
</P>
<P>
   Bilingualism is not a black-and-white issue. There is
considerable grey matter to consider. I recall when the residents
of Dade County, Fla., rose up against bilingualism and passed a
short-sighted law that eliminated all facets of it.
</P>
<P>
   As they tore down bilingualism, along went the bilingual aids
for emergency matters, such as warnings of dangerous situations
that might greet any and all in a specific area or on a specific
day. Gone also was the tourism assistance a visiting tourist would
find helpful. Even gone was the county's ability to advertise in
foreign-language newspapers or magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime soon, we need to come to grips with what really needs
to be bilingual and what does not. Bilingualism exacts a price from
the general population, both in emotion and dollars. An
understanding of both sides is needed and a compromise effected.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Romantic Gingrich believes love affair continues
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ironically, the roots of Tuesday's defeat for Newt Gingrich's
Republicans were in Gingrich's apparent triumph four years earlier
in the Contract With America election that produced a Republican
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich fancies himself a canny political technician and, yes,
he can change the odd flat tire, maybe fix a frayed electrical
cord. But he is also a political romantic, and as a romantic he
wildly misread his own 1994 accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich and the rest of the GOP right came out of the '94
election giddy with the thought they had won not just a political
contest but an ideological war. Here, finally, was the validation
they had worked for since their campus days as Young Americans for
Freedom. The way now lay open to wash away, as in a flash flood,
whole trailer parks of tacky liberal policy going back even to the
New Deal of President Franklin Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the electorate was voting only to force more
moderation on the new Clinton presidency _ and voting even for that
in low numbers and often by small margins.
</P>
<P>
   There was scant constituency for the ``revolution'' Gingrich
then declared, and less when voters caught on that the populist
rhetoric of the Contract meant, in practice, giving corporations
license to shoot the environment on sight and funding tax cuts
tilted to the richest. Voters were victims of a political
bait-and-switch. Gingrich et al. had market-tested how the Contract
sounded, not what they really intended.
</P>
<P>
   But in their continuing triumphalism, Republican conservatives
mistook Clinton's re-election as an electorate fumble, an
aberration, not the endorsement that it was of the president's
adjustment to the '94 rebuke. Hence, the House's conviction _ poll
after poll to the contrary notwithstanding _ that voters
really-really wanted Clinton thrown out of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Now Gingrich argues that, hey, this is the first time since the
1920s that Republicans will control Congress through three election
cycles. That's so and that's something. But Democrats win the
first-time-since contest. This is the first time since 1934 that a
president's party didn't lose seats in a midterm election, the
first time since 1822 that a White House gained seats in the sixth
year of a presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich still had it wrong after the Tuesday drubbing. He said
Republicans should concentrate on what the public wants _ tax cuts
and saving Social Security. But tax cuts are near the bottom of
most voter wish-lists, and Gingrich's idea of saving Social
Security is to privatize it virtually out of existence, leaving
only a politically fragile dole for the elderly poor. More
bait-and-switch.
</P>
<P>
   This election saw the state Republican parties extend their
solid gains of the '90s by continuing to field governors with a
knack for assembling socially diverse support and noted more for
their pragmatism than for their ideological gaudiness.
</P>
<P>
   Will the national Republican Party persist, instead, in the
romantic notion that with just a bit more ideological pushing, a
balky electorate finally will come boiling into the streets for the
radical revolution the party's right dreams about?

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: THE TRUE THEMES OF THE '98 VOTE
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Nov. 8.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rather than prepare a political pudding from the
results of the midterm voting, it might be better to follow Winston
Churchill's advice and send the results back to the kitchen for
lack of a binding theme.
</P>
<P>
   Spin chefs, having quaffed too many historical analogies at the
expectations bar, insist we pundits must down our pudding after
such a lugubrious campaign meal. But in Nevada (where the voters
appropriately broke down the middle), gamblers no doubt sense what
transpired: the elections were a push.
</P>
<P>
   A push pains the networks, who demand their anchors enunciate a
clear story line. But the right thing to do, as President Clinton
might say, requires them to take their money off the table.
</P>
<P>
   There's time enough to place bets on the 2000 elections. In the
meantime, here are a half-dozen side wagers on what lies ahead:
</P>
<P>
   1. Clinton won't be able to get his policy agenda enacted into
law.
</P>
<P>
   The chief reason behind this coming failure is so obvious that,
as with the emperor's outfit, it's rarely observed: the president
lacks the votes. His deficiency, however, won't deter newshounds
from letting forests fall and the airwaves resonate with breathless
reports about the upcoming State of the Union address.
</P>
<P>
   2. While the Republicans still control both houses of Congress,
they can't get their agenda enacted either.
</P>
<P>
   Threats of Clinton vetoes are potential circuit breakers. But
deep ideological fault lines within the party also deter action.
All that will yield lots of huffing and puffing about the need to
change leaders. The real need is to find some.
</P>
<P>
   3. To the extent Clinton's actions do matter, it will mainly be
in the foreign policy arena. On domestic initiatives, his
participation will matter to the degree he splits policy
differences with the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents enjoy wide freedom of action abroad; most of them
have used those chits. Domestically, Social Security reform is an
salient area for such a bipartisan bargain; campaign reform remains
more iffy.
</P>
<P>
   4. Don't stick a fork in Kenneth Starr yet. He isn't quite done.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's tormentor called time out for the elections. Now he's
back in the game. More indictments are coming. Their impact on the
impeachment process depends on how closely, as the Elizabethans
would have put it, they touch on the royal person.
</P>
<P>
   5. The Republicans still have the will to put Clinton on trial,
but they lack Senate votes to oust him.
</P>
<P>
   Ya gotta do what ya gotta do. Even if Starr is compromised at
the House Judiciary hearings, Republicans are likely to press their
case. News stories about what kind of president Al Gore would make
should remain spiked, however.

   6. Sooner or later, some totally unexpected event will come
along to alter the Washington calculus.

<P>
   Most pundits dutifully conclude that what is to come follows
what came before. But life isn't that way, as George Bush found in
1990 when the Iraqis stormed into Kuwait. There's somebody out
there now who also isn't bluffing, as the new Congress and the old
president and the recycled pundits will in due course discover.

   &UR; It's a new model year and, for consumers and manufacturers it's
going to be a challenge. Consumers have the ``problem'' of more
choices at more price points. For manufacturers, the year is a
gamble: How will the new models play in such a fickle market, and
will the economy slow sales? In this special report, the Globe
examines the situation.

   The midsize Chrysler Sebring ($21,150) is available as a two- or
four-door coupe and is sold only in a one-price LXI model. While
the Chrysler Sebring convertible ($20,500) bears the same name as
the coupe, it is not a coupe with the top cut off. Rather it is
designed as a convertible and does not share the same platform with
the coupe.
</P>

   Chrysler also offers the luxurious Town &AMP; Country minivan
($33,500).

   Daewoo has been selling cars throughout the world, but this
year, the company enters the American market under its own name for
the first time. (It once produced a small Pontiac for General
Motors).
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo offers some unconventional ideas in the selling and
marketing of its vehicles. College students have been recruited to
market the cars, and, at its sole Massachusetts outlet in Natick,
the company promises ``no hassle'' sales. The cars are priced below
their competition, and come with three-year free maintenance. About
the only cost of ownership for that period is gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   The three models being offered are the Lanos ($9,000-$12,000),
about the size of a Honda Civic; the Nubira ($12,000-$14,000),
about the size of a Ford Contour; and the Leganza
($15,000-$20,000), in the Toyota Camry size range.
</P>
<P>
   The Leganza, the company's flagship, comes only as a sedan, and,
like the other models, it is well-equipped for the price. The Lanos
is offered as a three-door hatchback and four-door sedan; and the
Nubira comes in three versions _ a sedan, five-door hatchback, and
wagon. In test rides, the models all proved quite competent in
handling, performance, and comfort.

   The Dodge Intrepid ($19,700), which offers seating for five or
six, emphasizes sports performance. The car is offered with a
choice of 200- or 225-horsepower V-6 engines and offers the
AutoStick transmission. Redesigned for the '98 model year, there
are few changes in '99.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodge Avenger ($15,300) is a sports coupe that comes with
either a four- or six-cylinder engine. Buyers can also chose
between a five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic transmission.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodge Stratus ($14,800) is a four-door sedan with good
interior room. The Stratus is available with either a four- or
V-6-cylinder engine. Unlike its near twin, the Chrysler Cirrus,
Stratus offers the AutoStick transmission.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodge/Plymouth Neon ($11,300) received upgrades last year,
and remains basically unchanged for '99. It will undergo a major
redesign in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   The compact Neon ``provides buyers with a great balance of
style, fun and value,'' says Joe Caddell, Neon product manager.
``The new Neon R/T model received rave reviews, which gained
attention for the rest of the line, including the higher level of
standard equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodge also offers the Caravan ($17,500) minivan, and a complete
line of trucks as well as the rugged Durango sport-utility.

   The title for having the last full-size, rear-drive vehicles in
America goes to Ford for its Crown Victoria ($21,135). The model,
which had a complete makeover last year, has a few modifications in
looks and power for this year.
</P>
<P>
   Horsepower has been increased from 200 to 215, 16-inch wheels
are now standard, and a performance/ &QC; 
handling package is available. These vehicles are popular with
police departments, and can be ordered with a Police Interceptor
package with larger anti-sway bars and suspension upgrade. In
addition to its spacious interior, with its solid body on frame,
the Crown Victoria can easily handle six passengers and all their
luggage as well as tow a boat or trailer.
</P>
<P>
   For '99, the Contour ($13,460) adds better handling along with
added room for rear-seat passengers. Contour now shares the same
suspension design as its European cousin, Mondeo. The brakes have
also been improved to provide better stability on different road
surfaces. The Contour is also available in a high-performance
version, the SVT, and as a bi-fuel natural gas vehicle, requiring
only the flip of a switch to operate on either natural gas or
gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   The '99 Escort ($11,280) comes with $1,000 worth of additional
equipment at no charge _ items such as aluminum wheels, luggage
rack, rear wiper, and cargo-area cover. The Escort seats five and
comes as a sedan or five-door wagon. The car was ranked best
compact car in initial quality in 1998 by J.D. Powers.
</P>
<P>
   For those who want an Escort with zip, Ford last year introduced
the ZX2 ($12,580). This year, Ford adds a ``hot'' and a ``cool''
model with design and amenity features to appeal to its youthful
buyers. ``ZX2's zesty ride, sporty appearance, affordable price,
and low operating costs appeal to youthful buyers _ or anyone else
who tries to enjoy life without busting their budget,'' says Kevin
Smith, ZX2 brand manager.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's most popular family vehicle, the Taurus ($17,995), enters
'99 with price cuts of $1,000 to almost $2,000 on various models.
Ford is also dropping the charge for emissions equipment, which was
$170. The Taurus comes with a choice of three engines _ a V-6 with
145 horsepower, a V-6 with 185 horsepower, or the high-performance
SHO version with a 235 horsepower V-8. The car can go 100,000 miles
between tune-ups.
</P>
<P>
   The base price for the '99 Mustang is still not settled, but
according to Janine Bay, chief program engineer, ``We've made
improvements that are much more than skin-deep. The 1999 Mustang is
true to its roots _ customers get an exciting new design with
enhanced performance.'' Besides new looks, Mustang, which traces
its heritage back 35 years, has added power to both the V-6 and V-8
engines, and _ for the first time _ has an optional traction
control system that works at all speeds. The car comes with a
five-speed manual, or an optional four-speed automatic
transmission.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the models, there are improvements ranging from
chassis to reduce noise and vibration to a long track for the
driver's seat to accommodate taller drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Ford also produces the Windstar ($19,180) minivan with dual
sliding doors and optional power on both doors, the Ford Explorer
($19,980), and the huge Expedition ($27,985) sport-utility
vehicles.

other amenities.

   The Honda Accord is still the No. 1 selling car in America. It,
and the all-new Odyssey ($24,000) minvan, lead Honda into the '99
model year. The Accord ($15,100), redesigned last year, has few
changes for '99; the biggest one is to meet more stringent
emissions levels.
</P>
<P>
   The Accord is available as a two-door coupe or a four-door
sedan. Station wagons have been discontinued. Buyers can select
either a four-cylinder or a V-6 engine mated to either a five-speed
manual or an automatic transmission. Accord claims a more spacious
interior than its two closest competitors, the Taurus or Camry.
</P>
<P>
   The new Odyssey minivan features center row captain's chairs
that can be moved together to form a bench seat. The midsize van is
powerful, offers good handling and has many new innovative
features.
</P>
<P>
   The Civic ($10,600), Honda's compact, comes in sedan, hatchback,
or coupe versions and has won the best-selling small car award for
the last two years. New styling touches have been added to the '99
model, which comes in a wide variety of trim levels.
</P>
<P>
   For the sporty crowd, Honda offers the Prelude ($23,000), a
coupe with nimble performance. Its four-cylinder engine has added
five horsepower, making it 200 hp, with a manual transmission.
Automatic drive is also available.
</P>
<P>
   Honda also offers the Isuzu-built Passport ($23,850)
sport-utility vehicle, featuring a V-6 engine and 4-wheel drive.

   Hyundai has completely redesigned its compact Sonata ($14,800).
This four-door sedan, which offers a choice of a four- or a
six-cylinder engine, has added room inside: The car is wider and
there is an inch more headroom. A 170-horsepower V-6 engine is
available and can be mated to a smoother shifting manual or a new
adaptive-logic automatic transmission, which changes the
transmission shifting patterns to suit the driver.
</P>
<P>
   The Elanta ($11,500) gets a limited facelift in its sedan and
wagon series, along with a beefed-up engine. These four-door
compacts now have the same peppy engine found in the sport Hyundai
Tiburon.
</P>
<P>
   The Tiburon ($13,600) hatchback offers hot styling, high
performance, and low price. There are no changes in the '99
version.

<P>
   Infiniti has an all-new G20 ($20,995). This entry-level Infiniti
has lots of nice touches and is bigger with better handling and
performance than when it was last produced in '96. It comes with a
140-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine from the Nissan
Sentra. Its suspension also borrows from the European-marketed
Primera. A Bose sound system is standard, along with side-impact
airbags.
</P>
<P>
   Infiniti's flagship Q45 ($47,900) now offers electronically
modulated shocks with selective settings and other refinements
including Xenon gas headlights.
</P>
<P>
   The midsize I30 ($28,900) has only minor changes for '99. Among
them, traction control is an option, and the antitheft system has
an engine immobilizer.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; LEXUS
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ES300 ($30,905), Lexus' entry-level model, gets a new drive
train for 1999. The 3.0-liter V-6 engine employs continuously
variable valve timing to creater higher horsepower, lower emissions
and improved fuel economy, while at the same time boosting
low-revolutions per minute torque for acceleration.
</P>
<P>
   The new engine was first introduced in the '99 sport-utility
Lexus RX300 ($31,550) and is exclusive to the Lexus Division. With
the addition of the new engine and transmission, the ES300 now has
75 percent of its components, including sheet metal, unique to the
ES300 or other Lexus models. It is no longer a dressed-up Camry.
</P>
<P>
   The front-wheel drive ES300 offers as an option an Adaptive
Variable Suspension system that tracks road surface conditions,
speed and other factors to continuously change each wheel's
shock-absorber settings. This also permits the driver to select the
desired range of ride character from sport to comfort.
</P>
<P>
   The Lexus LS400 ($53,605) is the company's flagship luxury sedan
and rated one of the finest vehicles in production today. With its
new generation V-8 engine with Variable Valve Timing, the car is
tuned for greater engine performance, better fuel economy and
reduced pollution. Coupled to a five-speed automatic, the car
sprints to 60 miles an hour in 6.6 seconds. It is not only
comfortable and quiet to drive, but also quite nimble when called
on. The LS400 is loaded with safety and comfort features; standard
is a Vehicle Skid Control system that monitors vehicle handling and
helps compensate for loss of lateral traction in slippery
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The GS400 ($45,505) and GS300 ($37,305) are four-door sports
sedans loaded with comfort and performance features. The GS400
comes with a 300-horsepower V-8 engine, and the GS300 offers a
six-cylinder that goes from 0-60 m.p.h in 7.6 seconds (the V-8 does
it in 6 seconds). Both models look nimble but have excellent space
inside. Lexus says the cars go ``beyond cab-forward designs, with
the cabin and trunk space of large prestige luxury models.'' Among
standard safety features are the Vehicle Skid Control and
electronic traction control.
</P>
<P>
   The Lexus SC coupe series also comes in two models, the 300 and
400. Enhancements for 1999 include audio system improvements,
larger brakes for the SC300, daytime running lights and a 3-spoke
steering wheel design similar to that of the GS series sports
sedans. The SC300 ($42,905) has a 3.0-liter six-cylinder engine
that can hit 60 m.p.h. in 7.9 seconds, the SC 400 ($55,205) has a
4.0-liter V-8 engine rated with 290 horsepower.

   For 1999, the Continental ($38,325) adds side airbags for driver

comfortably and has had its horsepower upped from 260 to 275.
Safety features include antilock brakes, traction control, Michelin
tires capable of running 100 miles without air and a Remote
Emergency Satellite Cellular Unit, which automatically calls for
assistance when any air bags deploy. Lincoln notes the Continental
has more front headroom and overall interior and trunk space than
its competitor, the Cadillac DeVille.

<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, how many ways can you say ``sport utility''? Plenty, would
seem to be the answer as more car makers add sport utility models
to their lineup. And, there are hints that even more makers are
about to enter the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Lexus added to its '99 sport utility lineup earlier this year
with the RX 300. Now, Cadillac joins in with the Escalade, Suzuki
adds the Grand Vitara, and there's even one from Quigley.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley?
</P>
<P>
   Well, more about that later.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen and Porsche are planning a joint venture, BMW is said
to be working on one, Saab is looking for one, Saturn is giving
thoughts to having one and Daewoo, which just entered the American
market, reportedly has one in its future.
</P>
<P>
   Jeep certainly isn't sitting by. It has an all-new Grand
Cherokee that's bigger, roomier, more powerful, and with a new
all-wheel-drive train. Reportedly the only things being picked up
from the '98 version are 127 screws.
</P>
<P>
   If there are not already a lot of choices in models, consider,
too, that not all sport utility vehicles are alike. Which means
anyone looking for a SUV has a lot of shopping ahead _ not just for
price, but for features as well. Do you want full-time four-wheel
drive, or do you really want all-wheel drive? Do you want a low
range for off-road adventure, or a choice of two-wheel, four-wheel
drive? Do you want room to spare? Do you want to feel the ruts or
ride in carlike comfort? How high off the road do you want to be?
How easy is it to shift between drives? What's the noise level
inside like? How does it feel going around a corner? (Some SUVs,
especially some of the smaller ones, give the feeling of an
impending rollover. If it doesn't feel right, don't go for it.)
These are questions you should answer before putting your money
down.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys have shown that more than 95 percent of sport-utility
owners never go off-road. They simply use them for shopping,
commuting, hauling the kids, a boat or a trailer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for auto dealers, a SUV or two on the lot is a must.
That's one reason Cadillac, for the first time in its 96-year
history, is putting its name on a truck. Sales of the Lincoln
Navigator were too much for Cadillac to bear, it needed something
to keep its flock in the Cadillac tent. Enter the Cadillac
Escalade.
</P>
<P>
   The Escalade is basically an even fancier, smoother-riding
version of the Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon and Denali. It's not
as huge as the Lincoln Navigator but it has plenty of power in its
255 horsepower engine, and can make grand music with its Bose
Acoustimass sound system.
</P>
<P>
   The Jeep Grand Cherokee, its fans say, leaves almost nothing to
desire. The new Grand Cherokee may look a lot like the old, but its
a far different riding, handling, all-around vehicle. Some have
reported it outclasses the Mercedes M-Class, and Chrysler
reportedly was going to promote that, until they became part of the
Mercedes family. Make your own comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   There's just about nothing Chrysler didn't change on the '99.
There's a new engine, new all-wheel-drive system, more room, new
seats, new transmission, well, it's all new. Even the spare tire
has been taken out of the cargo area and placed under the vehicle.
Chrysler hasn't missed a trick _ it spend $2.65 billion, including
$750 million in plant preparation.
</P>
<P>
   The new Quadra-Drive system is designed to keep the Jeep going
even if three wheels lose traction. It has a new suspension
designed for better ride and handling. And its new 16-valve,
4.7-liter V-8 is said to offer better mileage, and 30 percent less
emissions. Add to that a long list of luxury items, including dual
climate zones, and you have quite a vehicle to go just about
anywhere. The Laredo version starts at $26,220, the Limited at
$34,415 for the four-wheel drive version.
</P>
<P>
   The luxury market for SUVs is growing. General Motors added the
Denali last spring, loading it with lots of amenities to set it
apart from the GMC Yukon. Its one-price comes with just about
everything. The same is true of GMC's new top-of-the-line,
everything-included Envoy, which has features not available in any
other GM SUV product. It's nicely styled and equipped. While lots
of manufacturers are citing the ``carlike'' ride of their SUVs, GM
is stressing the ``trucklike'' strength of their models, which may
have a carlike ride, but are built on truck frames.
</P>
<P>
   Lexus entered the SUV market last March with the RX300
($31,500), and like other Lexus products, shows a lot of innovation
along with comfort features. The RX300 raises the question of what
is a SUV? This new entry to the market certainly doesn't look like
a sport utility, it rides more like a car (it is built on a Camry
frame), and it lacks a low-range gear for true off-road driving.
But it has all the other SUV attributes _ high seating, all-wheel
drive, and roomy interior. It also gets better mileage than most
SUVs _ around 19 miles to the gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Lexus also offers the LX470 ($58,500), a full-size, full-time
4wd with V-8 power that is new this year, replacing the LX450. The
vehicle is similar to the Toyota Land Cruiser. The new vehicles are
aimed at becoming the ``King of 4WD,'' according to Toyota. The
vehicles have a new 32-valve, 4.7-liter V-8 that offers a 7 percent
fuel gain, a new Automatic Height Control system allowing the
driver to raise the body by up to 2 inches at the push of a button,
a new heating system, better stability, and a spacious interior.
</P>
<P>
   Winning accolades since its '98 introduction is the
Mercedes-Benz M-Class sport utility. The ML320 ($34,950) has been
cited for its ride, safety, ruggedness, performance, fuel economy,
usability and price _ it's in the same range as a top-of-the-line
Ford Explorer or Jeep Grand Cherokee. Consumer Reports puts it at
the top of its SUV list. The only problem with the V-6 powered
ML320 is availability _ it's a long wait for the Alabama-produced
vehicle. This year, Mercedes adds a second model, the ML430 with
V-8 power. Some of the nice touches of the M-Class include bumpers
set at the same level as a car (unlike other SUVs, the Mercedes
bumper won't end up in a car's body, causing additional damage
during a collision), BabySmart automatic child seat recognition (a
system that deactivates the front passenger-side airbag if a child
is in a booster seat in front), and a new Power Skyview Top option
that offers a huge roof opening (about four-feet by three-feet
wide).
</P>

   Ford is still king of the hill when it comes to sales of its
Explorer and near twin, Mercury Mountaineer. For '99 the Explorer
adds a Reverse Sensing System (a whole-range rear warning system to
alert drivers of objects when backing up), side airbags, Homelink
(a remote control for opening garage doors, lights, etc),
Travelnote, an electronic message organizer that records and plays
messages. On an environmental note, both the Explorer and
Expedition (Mountaineer and Navigator, as well) are now
low-emission vehicles, producing 40 percent less smog-forming
emissions than before.
</P>
<P>
   The Expedition, Ford's huge SUV, adds an optional
power-adjustable brake and accelerator pedals that can be adjusted
up to 3 inches, a plus for shorter drivers. These features can also
be found in the Lincoln Navigator and the Mercury Mountaineer.

   In the lower price range, Suzuki is out to set a new standard
for mini-sport-utility vehicles. The Grand Vitara ($21,429) will be
the first in its class to have a V-6 engine, and with its body
built onto a steel ladder frame like larger SUVs, this vehicle is a
true off-roader, complete with a four-wheel drive system. It
includes a two-speed transfer case with low range for climbing and
descending steep hills. The inside of the Grand Vitara is said to
almost equal that of the Jeep Cherokee.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Vitara is joined by two four-cylinder versions: the
Suzuki Vitara and the Chevrolet Tracker. These will be available as
two-door convertible or four-door hardtop. The V-6 will only be
available at Suzuki dealers.

   Kia, a Korean company, has slowly been making its way to the
East Coast and arrived in New England this fall. Along with it
comes the Kia Sportage, which is designed to appeal to Generation X
in style, and more importantly, in price. The Kia Sportage starts
at $14,445, a thousand or more dollars less than competitors such
as the Isuzu Amigo and Toyota RAV4. The Kia will be available as a
two-door convertible and four-door model.

   Ever since Consumer Reports labeled the 1996 Isuzu Trooper II
and the 1988 Suzuki Samurai as being unacceptable for, in Consumer
Union's eye, a tendency to roll over in emergency tests, consumers
have become aware that this could be a problem in any SUV. SUVs sit
high above the road and, therefore, tend to lean more in turns than
lower profile automobiles. The new Land Rover Discovery Series II
offers a computer-assisted system that should allay this unsettling
feeling. The Discovery features ACE _ active cornering enhancement
_ which uses hydraulic levers that counter the lateral tilt of the
vehicle's body. This is the only vehicle sold in America that
offers such a system.
</P>
<P>
   The Land Rover Discovery II ($35,000) is the second generation
of this model. The new model is slightly lower and six inches
longer than last year's. The added space goes for cargo and
rear-seat passengers. The new model also comes with another first _
an electronic hill descent control that supplements engine braking
on steep hills by automatically applying the brakes as needed. The
Discovery is also four inches wider than the '98, and has a V-8
engine that has added power and torque.
</P>
<P>
   Other SUVs already on the market include the Acura SLX
($38,300), Chevrolet Blazer ($21,600), the monstrous Chevrolet/GMC
Suburban ($25,500), Dodge Durango ($27,000), available with an
optional 5.9-liter V-8, the biggest engine in its class; GMC Jimmy
($21,800), Honda CR-V ($18,300), Honda Passport ($$23,800),
Infiniti QX4 ($35,550), Isuzu Rodeo ($17,900), Isuzu Trooper

   Oh yes, what's a Quigley? Quigley is a company that has been

   The Town Car ($38,325), which was redesigned last year giving it
a more contemporary design along with a smoother ride, adds side
airbags for front passengers this year. While 92 percent of Town
Car buyers cite seating capacity as the reason for buying the
vehicle, Jim O'Sullivan, Lincoln brand manager, notes, ``Engine
performance, prestige, and vehicle dynamics are Town Car's trump
cards in attracting new customers.''

   Isuzu no longer offers car models in its lineup. Instead it is
concentrating on sport-utilities, the Rodeo ($18,000), a compact,
rear- or 4-wheel drive model, and the Trooper ($27,800), the
compnay's midsize 4-wheel drive model. It also offers a compact
minivan, the Oasis ($23,530), which is based on last year's Honda
Odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   Isuzu will be calling attention to itself this spring when it
brings its futuristic VehiCROSS sport-utility ($30,000) to the
marketplace. The VehiCROSS will come with a 215 horsepower V-6

   Jaguar is pretty much sticking to its '98 offerings with minor

   Last spring, Mazda came out with a new Miata ($19,800), making
it even more loveable. For '99, the new two-seater makes putting
the top down a lot easier, drops the pop-up headlights, and offers
a quieter and more powerful ride.
</P>
<P>
   Soon to come on the market is an all-new subcompact
Protege &UR;  &LR; ($12,200), which is said to have the largest interior in
its class. Adding to its appeal will be a larger 105-horsepower
engine.
</P>
<P>
   Having just revamped the midsize 626 ($15,700) last year, this
model receives only minor changes for '99.
</P>
<P>
   Mazda's top-of-the-line sedan, the midsize Millenia ($26,000)
gets a facelift, but more importantly lower prices, with models
costing from $2,400 to $5,500 (for the top model with Miller Cycle
engine) less than last year.

   The Grand Marquis ($22,220), having undergone a major revamping
last year, adds more safety features, color, and trim changes for
the new model year. The major selling points on the vehicle are its
full-size roominess, trunk space, and rear-drive. With its
contemporary looks, it's a car that can fit in anywhere or
anyplace. It comes with PrecisionTrac, a suspension system that
provides excellent directional control even during strong
crosswinds. In a survey, 90 percent of its buyers cited the Grand
Marquis for quietness and cargo capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The Mystique ($16,925) adds extra leg room for back seat
passengers for '99. Other improvements include front suspension for
better ride, and brakes to provide a more stable braking on uneven
surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   The family-sized Sable ($18,445) enters the new year with lower
prices _ $1,000 to $2,000 less than last year _ along with interior
and exterior changes. The Sable has been awarded the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration's five-star rating for sedan
and wagon models. The Sable is also available with a no-charge
optional six-passenger seating configuration that includes a
flip-fold center seat that doubles as a console.
</P>
<P>
   The Tracer ($11,995), Mercury's small car, adds a sport wagon
with leather seating and 15-inch tires. The car comes with a
four-cylinder engine and four-speed automatic transmission.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougar ($16,595) is Mercury's one-of-a-kind vehicle _ it
doesn't share its looks with a Thunderbird as in year's past. The
Cougar is smaller than previous models, but also a lot more sporty
looking and offers better driving characteristics. While the Cougar
is based on the Mystique platform, its suspension and steering
elements have been recalibrated for sports car handling and
performance. The Cougar boasts individual bucket-style sports seats
designed for both comfort and support. The Cougar features optional
head and chest side air bags for the driver and front passenger.
</P>
<P>
   The company also offers the redesigned Mercury Villager

   Its subcompact Mirage ($10,900) sedan is available in two- and
four-door models, and is relatively unchanged for '99.

   The sophisticated Diamante ($27,600), Mitsubishi's midsize
four-door sedan has only one model this year. It comes with V-6
power and an adaptive automatic that senses the driver's actions to
modify shifting patterns.

<P>
   For sports car lovers, Mitsubishi offers the subcompact Eclipse

   Nissan has decided to drop its sporty models in favor of its
sedans, the Maxima and Sentra.
</P>
<P>
   Both vehicles come with few changes for '99. The Sentra
($11,500) is offered only as a four-door sedan, which comes with a
keyless entry system and five trim levels, including a Limited
Edition with CD player and front stabilizer bar.
</P>
<P>
   The Maxima ($21,500) provides sporty handling for a midsize
sedan. The Maxima is one of the few sedans that offers a five-speed
manual _ very smooth to operate. A four-speed automatic is also
offered to go with its 190 horsepower V-6 power plant.

   Oldsmobile enters the model year with a new nameplate, the
Alero, a compact entry-level sedan. The Alero ($16,300), like last
year's new model, Intrigue ($20,900), a midsize car, is designed to
be a foreign car fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Oldsmobile is pinning a lot of hope on the Alero, looking for up
to 150,000 sales, a tall order for a company that has been
suffering in overall sales. But the Alero offers a lot of promise
as a well-equipped vehicle with an attractive price. The Alero
comes in coupe and sedan versions with a choice of a four-cylinder
base engine or an optional V-6.
</P>
<P>
   The Alero continues Oldsmobile's efforts to gain a new image for
its second hundred years in business. The company celebrated its
100th birthday last year and is General Motors oldest division. As
part of its new countenance, Olds is creating an entire new product
line. New nameplates have replace the old. The Alero is not just a
revamped model, but an entirely new vehicle. In its quest to get a
new image _ ``It's not your father's Olds'' _ the company dropped
the Ninety Eight, will end production on the Eighty Eight in
December, and the Cutlass Supreme next summer.
</P>
<P>
   The new imaging has given Oldsmobile enough confidence to put
its nameplate back on its models. When the Aurora was introduced,
the name Oldsmobile could not be found on the vehicle. The same
happened with Intrigue, but now both models bear the Olds symbol.
</P>
<P>
   Oldsmobile's other models include the Intrigue, the luxurious
Aurora ($36,000), the luxury minivan Silhouette ($24,000), and the
fancy sport utility, the Bravada ($30,700).

   The Plymouth brand has only one sedan in its line, the Breeze
($14,800), similar to the Chrysler Cirrus and Dodge Stratus. The
Breeze is designed for affordability, and while sharing the same
body as the Cirrus and Stratus, it lacks some of the standard
equipment of the others. It is offered also in a Style package with
added equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The hot-rod styled Prowler ($36,000) enters its second
production year with a new 3.5-liter, V-6 aluminum engine and some
new colors. In addition to Prowler Purple, an eye-popping yellow
and, soon, red and black are on the color shopping list.

Pontiac's best seller. For '99, the Grand Am has a 3.6-inch longer
wheelbase and is available with a new high-end engine that produces
170 horsepower, an increase of 15 more horsepower than the previous
V-6. Other engines range from a four-cylinder to the new V-6.
Available in coupe or sedan, its body is now stiffer, braking
better, and quieter on the inside.

   What's new (and in some cases, not so new) in the world of cars,
minivans, trucks and SUVs? While some models indicate few or no
changes for '99, most have been completely updated over the last
couple of years. All prices shown are approximate base figures;
many manufacturers have not set final prices. Where more than one
model is listed, the price reflects the lowest priced model.

   The all-new Acura 3.2TL sedan offers not only comfort but also a
more agile feel in its handling. The four-door 3.2 TL comes loaded
for around $29,000. About the only option is a navigation system
that guarantees you'll never get lost again. The sedan also has a
new V-6 engine with 225 horsepower and a SportShift automatic
transmission.
</P>
<P>
   For its flagship 3.5 RL sedan ($41,200), the car maker offers
refinements _ 400 changes the company says _ from better braking
and added air bags to sportier handling.
</P>
<P>
   The sporty entry-level Acura Integra ($19,200) now comes with
15-inch alloy wheels. The Acura 3.0 CL Coupe ($22,400) adds
amenities such as heated front seats to its base model. The
Integera shares much of its mechanics with the Honda Accord EX
coupe.
</P>
<P>
   For high-tech, high performance, Acura offers the NSX ($84,000),
unchanged for '99. The company also has the SLX sport-utility
($36,000), which is really an Isuzu Trooper with the Acura badge.

   New this year is Audi's A6 Avant ($36,600) station wagon. The
sporty looking model comes with low-powered front airbags and
airbags in the side panels. Rear seat side airbags are also
available as an option.
</P>
<P>
   The Avant is also offered in the A4 ($34,500) series and it
comes with new options with its Quattro all-wheel drive. The
transmission can be either a five-speed automatic with Tiptronic,
or a five-speed manual.
</P>
<P>
   The A4 ($23,800), A6 ($33,700) and A8 ($57,400) sedans are given
added features and other improvements for '99. The A8, Audi's
luxurious sedan, includes a warm-weather package that offers
rear-window shades and a solar sunroof that circulates air while
the car is parked.

   A new sedan, the Arnage ($230,800), with a twin-turbo, 4.4-liter
BMW V-8 engine is Bentley's featured model for '99. The sedan
shares many parts with the V-12 Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph.
</P>
<P>
   If it seems strange to have a BMW engine in a Bentley, it
shouldn't: BMW has been building engines for the company with the
intent of purchasing the firm. However, BMW lost out in its bid for
Rolls-Royce/Bentley to Volkswagen. While VW now owns one of the
most prestigious nameplates in the auto world, it appears the
company building Rolls and Bentley didn't own the Rolls-Royce name.
So, BMW jumped in and bought the Rolls name, and now plans on
building the Rolls in a new factory around 2002. Until then, VW has
the Bentley name and will build those models. After 2002, VW will
just produce Bentleys. Other models in the Bentley lineup, the
Azure convertible and Continental R and Continental T, remain
unchanged.

   An all new 3-series sedan along with a 5-series wagon are new
for '99. While the newest 3-series _ the 318I and 328I sedans _
have been totally redone for '99, BMW will continue to sell the
coupe and convertible versions from '98 through next year, when
those models will begin their upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   The new sedans offer the performance and handling one expects
from a BMW, while providing additional space. The sedans are at
least an inch longer, wider and higher, and offer many design
touches that look like the far more expensive 5 and 7 series
models.
</P>
<P>
   The 323I ($27,000) has a 2.5-liter, six-cylinder, 170-horsepower
engine, while the 328Ii ($34,400) offers a 2.8-liter six-cylinder
engine with 193 horsepower. Both sedans are similar, but have
differences in power and luxury features.
</P>
<P>
   The new models offer traction control, along with Cornering
Brake Control for better handling on turns. In addition to front
dual airbags, BMWs offer an Inflatable Tubular Structure for head
protection and optional rear seat side-impact airbags as saftey
features.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-series wagon, which is returning to the lineup, is offered
as a 528I Sportwagon with an in-line six engine or as the 540I
Sportwagon with a V-8 power plant.
</P>
<P>
   A new coupe is being produced at BMW's South Carolina plant. The
Z3 ($29,500) Coupe 2.8 and the high-performance M Coupe join the Z3
roadster. The roadsters all come with inline six-cylinder engines
(the four-cylinder models have been dropped). While the Z3
convertible is a hot performer, the new M Roadster ($42,000) adds
to the thrill of owning a BMW with its larger engine, more rigid
body and wide tires for better road handling.
</P>
<P>
   The full-size BMW 7-Series ($61,500) models _ the 740I and 740iL
(4.5 inches longer) _ are luxurious in comfort, handling, and
performance.

   Say goodbye to the Riviera, Buick's two-door sporty coupe; it
was part of General Motors' cost-cutting plan to eliminate slow
selling models.
</P>
<P>
   In Buick's other models, the changes are mainly cosmetic. The
Century ($19,335), however, does get improvements in antilocking
brakes, suspension and traction control. The Regal ($22,255)
includes a tire-inflation monitor along with an additional
5-horsepower engine and optional 15-inch aluminum wheels. Regal
comes in two trim levels, the LS and GS. The LS comes with a
stiffer sportier ride along with improved suspension.

   LeSabre ($23,340) has few changes; the Park Avenue ($31,000),
Buick's full-size luxury sedan has a new stereo system.

switches to a gasoline tank for fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The midsize Chevy Lumina ($17,300), Monte Carlo coupe ($17,800),
compact Malibu ($15,700), and subcompact Metro ($8,900) remain
unchanged. The Metro is the model for those looking for outstanding
mileage, with EPA ratings of up to 44 miles per gallon. The Prizm

with the performance-oriented, sleek 300M ($28,300) are all new for
this model year. The sedans, which have been available since
spring, join the Concorde, which was redesigned last year, as the
company's leading products.
</P>
<P>
   The LHS provides luxurious comfort for five in a spacious
cab-forward design and is powered by a smooth 253 horsepower V-6
engine.
</P>
<P>
   The 300M reflects Chrysler's history, displaying the heritage of
the famed 300s of the '50s and '60s. The car is designed not only
for performance, but to be sold internationally. Combining a
five-meter overall length with the most spacious interior of any
vehicle in the five-meter class allows the 300M to be sold
successfully not only in North America but also in 30 international
markets. The car is powered by Chrysler's new high-output 3.5-liter
V-6 engine, and comes with an AutoStick transmission, which
provides the control of a manual transmission with the convenience
of an automatic.

   The midsize, Firebird ($17,700) is available as a two-door
hatchback and convertible ($28,900). The sports car now offers
electronic traction control on both the V-6 and V-8 models and adds
an eight-speaker sound system as standard equipment.

   The Grand Prix ($18,700) is available as both coupe and sedan.
For '99, this midsize model ups the power to 200 horses, and offers
the OnStar mobile communications system.
</P>
<P>
   The subcompact Sunfire ($12,600) offers three body choices _
two-door coupe, convertible and four-door sedan. Only minor changes
are offered in '99.

   After 34 years, Porsche has a new 911 ($65,000), which offers a
flat (but not air-cooled), 296-horsepower engine and a six-speed
manual transmission for quick, responsive handling. It is offered
with rear- or all-wheel drive, and as a coupe or convertible.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly one of the most popular subcompact sports cars is the
Boxter ($41,000). This ``affordable'' Porsche has great looks,

   The first new Rolls-Royce in nearly two decades has arrived. The
Silver Seraph ($216,400) comes with a V-12 engine, five-speed
adaptive transmission, new suspension, braking and traction
assistance, and an engine built by BMW.
</P>
<P>
   The name, Silver Seraph _ seraph is defined by the Oxford

associated especially with light, ardor, and purity'' is in keeping
with this high-end offering.
</P>
<P>
   For the price, only the finest of materials are used. For
example, for the center console, 10 thin layers of Tulip wood are
formed for the finished veneer. And owners, with the help of
Rolls-Royce design team, can design interior touches to include
anything from a navigation system to a business center on wheels.

replace its aging 9000 series. The 9-5 is a full-size sedan powered
by either a four-cylinder or V-6 engine. A wagon version will be
out this spring. The car is loaded with innovative features such as
ventilated front seats and the Saab Active Head Restraint system
for improved protection from whiplash. There is even an
air-conditioned glove box in this nicely equipped and performing
car.

known best for their no hassle sales, dealer service, and
affordable prices.
</P>
<P>
   Saturn has found the one complaint they get from customers is
engine noise, and this year engineers have made a number of changes

   Subaru has made its mark in all-wheel-drive vehicles. Since
opting to sell only AWD models in 1993, Subaru has seen its sales
almost triple to more than 130,000 in 1997. Unlike other
manufacturers who tend to market vehicles to people based on age or
income, Subaru bases its sales on interest. It targets health care
and education workers who need to go in any kind of weather, as
well as those with outdoor interests.

   Toyota has only one new model for 1999, but that's not bad for a
company that had the No. 1 best-selling car in America last year _
the Camry. The company continues to expand in this country,
building a new plant in Indiana for its upcoming full-size truck
and possibly a sports utility.
</P>
<P>
   New for '99 is the Camry Solara ($18,600), a two-door coupe with
distinctive looks. Toyota says the Solara is aimed at ``consumers
entering their peak earning years, who are nostalgic for the sports
cars of their youth, but need more room and comfort than a sports
car can provide.'' It comes with either a four-cylinder or V-6
engine and five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission.
Fifteen-inch wheels are standard and a sports package is available
on the V-6, which includes 16-inch wheels. Solara is the first
Toyota to have a new JBL premium sound system with 200 watts and
eight speakers ``that will achieve a level of performance and sound
reproduction previously unavailable in a Toyota.''
</P>
<P>
   The Camry ($17,000), on which the Solara is based, adds more
safety features and enhanced convenience options. Front-seat
side-impact airbags are available as an option on Camry this year.
The Camry sedan is available with either a four-cylinder or V-6
engine. All models come with a four-speed automatic. New this year
is an optional five-speed manual transmission paired with the V-6
engine on the LE model.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota describes its Avalon ($24,500) as its best equipped and
most spacious vehicle. The car is available in either five- or
six-seat configurations. After four successful years as Toyota's
flagship, the '99 comes with only minor exterior and interior
changes. The car is powered by a V-6 engine.
</P>
<P>
   The compact Corolla ($11,900), which was totally redesigned last
year, enters the new model year almost unchanged. The car comes
with a four-cylinder engine matched to a five-speed manual
transmission that can offer EPA mileage estimates of 31 city, 38
highway. Three-speed and four-speed automatic transmissions as well
as side airbags are options.
</P>
<P>
   The sporty Celica ($17,200) comes with few changes and one less
model _ the GT Coupe. These fun-to-drive vehicles are powered by a
four-cylinder engine matched to a five-speed manual transmission.
The car is available as a GT Liftback and a GT Convertible. A
four-speed automatic transmission is optional.

   The Beetle isn't the only thing new or coming from Volkswagen.
The German manufacturer is launching completely redesigned or new
models throughout its line in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   The Beetle ($15,200), which has been getting lots of attention
since its introduction earlier this year, is also getting more
features, which should make it even more popular. An optional
20-valve turbo-charged engine tops the list. Other items include an
optional power sunroof, door entry lights, rear reading lights, and
an eyeglass holder. And, of course, the flower-holding vase
returns.
</P>
<P>
   The Passat ($20,800), which was redesigned last year, is now
also offered as a wagon with a choice of four-cylinder or V-6
power. The Passet GLX wagon will offer Volkswagen's Syncro
all-wheel drive along with a five-speed automatic transmission with
Tiptronic, which allows the car to be driven manually or
automatically.
</P>
<P>
   The Golf ($13,500) will arrive soon in the US market with a
larger and more ridgid body. Engine choices include a 2.0-liter
four-cylinder engine and an optional turbo-charged direct-injection
diesel. The car will come with lots of standard features from
antilock brakes to an instrument panel with blue back-lit
illumination. Side airbags are included.
</P>
<P>
   The GTI (about $16,700), a three-door hatchback, will arrive
early next year, and will feature a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine
or a hot performing V-6 with 172 horsepower, known as the VR6.
</P>
<P>
   The Jetta ($14,600), due this month, comes with a new look as
well as added features. The car offers a standard 2.0-liter,
four-cylinder engine and an optional VR6.
</P>
<P>
   After a short absence, VW is bringing back its EuroVan
($29,900), with V-6 power. The van can be ordered with a Weekender
Package that includes a pop-up roof with two-person bed. An
extended wheelbase version for added room is also available.

   Volvo enters the 1999 model year with new models and a switch to
front-wheel drive on all vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The all-new front-drive S80 ($35,800) midsize sedan replaces the
former rear-drive S90. The S80 is not only Volvo's largest sedan,
but also its most luxurious. The car can also be a powerhouse. It
is available with two engines _ an inline 6 cylinder with 201
horsepower or a 2.8-turbocharged plant with 265 horsepower. The S80
is also loaded with safety improvements, including an inflatable
curtain for extra head protection in addition to front and side
airbags and a new whiplash protection system designed to cut
injuries from rear-end collisions.
</P>
<P>
   The S70 ($27,900) sedan, which was redesigned for the '98 model
year, has few changes for '99. It is available in both sedan and
station wagon models. An all-wheel drive sedan joins the
all-wheel-drive station wagon series. The models come with a
five-cylinder engine with horsepower ranging from 190 to a
turbocharged 236.
</P>
<P>
   With its C70 ($39,000) coupe or convertible, Volvo is showing
the company can be a stylish as well safety-minded company. The
5-cylinder engine can be mated to either a five-speed manual or
four-speed automatic transmission.

 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ I was stuck in traffic on Route 3 heading for the Cape,
not an unusual summer happening. This time, though, I had just
gotten into an Acura 3.5RL with a dash-mounted navigation system.
</P>
<P>
   Having time on my hands, I decided to program the system to
Bridge Street in Orleans where I was heading (I later learned I
could have programmed it to get me out of the mess on an
alternative route). The system worked fine, not only showing me my
location on a small TV-like screen but also how far I was from my
destination.
</P>
<P>
   As I was moving along Route 6, suddenly a woman's voice came out
of nowhere to inform me I was just a half mile from the Orleans
rotary. Then, as I entered the rotary, she told me to take the
third left, then a right, then a quick left, then another onto
Bridge Street.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was late and I had promised my wife dinner, we took the
advice of our hosts at the Whaleback Inn to try the Binnacle
Tavern. Once again, the navigation system guided me easily to the
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   On Cape Cod, the only flaws were that many roads are not mapped
on the program, nor are street numbers. In major cities, like
Boston, the system is programmed for all streets and can find your
destination by street number as well.
</P>
<P>
   Heading back to the Globe, the system worked even better. It
requested a street number and guided me to the door. It also has
some unnerving features. As I approached the Globe on the Southeast
Expressway, I thought about getting off at Exit 14 instead of Exit
15. As I approached Exit 14 my thoughts were completely erased as
that woman suddenly came on telling me to stay on the Expressway
and get off at 15. Does it read minds?
</P>
<P>
   What thoroughly impressed me was its performance when I was
heading to the western Massachusetts town where I live. First, it
wanted to take me from the Globe onto the Southeast Expressway and
then the Massachusetts Turnpike. I decided to go the way I always
do, through South Boston. Unlike a previous system I tried, this
one required no manual fiddling to readjust my routing. It quickly
adapted to my route. Again, I threw it off by exiting in Cambridge;
it wanted to send me west on the turnpike. Within the next mile or
two it readjusted on its own a couple of times; first to get me
back on the turnpike, then, finally, it accepted my Route 2
headings and got me to within a mile of home accurately.
</P>
<P>
   Navigation systems have come a long way since first being
introduced. Some, like those on Mercedes-Benz vehicles, come with
not only lots of memory for cities across the country, but with
free updates as more information is available _ such as finding
more streets on the Cape or street numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem with built-in navigation systems is the cost of
the option. Most go for at least $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   With the cost of laptop computers down to well under $1,500 for
a fairly well-equipped model, my solution would be to buy a laptop
and add a program such as DeLorme's Street Atlas USA. With the
atlas loaded into a laptop, combined with the optional DeLorme GPS
receiver, you'll never get lost. The street atlas will route you,
find streets and addresses, provide exit information, and can even
be linked to go online to find restaurants and hotels. And the 6.0
new version adds 600,000 new or improved streets. Street Finder
retails for $45 and, with the GPS receiver, $159. Which means that
for under $1,500 you could have not only a portable navigation
system but also a computer that can handle lots of other details.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative, found now on almost all General Motors products,
is On-Star. A 24-hour system that combines on-board electronics,
global positioning system technology and a hands-free cellular
telephone to link the driver and vehicle with the OnStar center
where advisers can provide person-to-person help, from directions
to making hotel or restaurant reservations.
</P>
<P>
   The system also automatically notifies the center in case of any
front air bag deployment so that the adviser can send emergency
services to wherever you are. Other services range from theft
detection notification and stolen vehicle tracking to road service.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; 1. Do your homework:  &LR;  If you don't know what is available in
the automobile marketplace, you can't make a smart decision. A good
place to start is reading auto sections like this or picking up a
copy of one of the new car magazines. Attending the New England
International Automobile Show (see story on Page K2) also makes
good sense. Here you can check out just about every make and model
available. Sit in the vehicles, read the sticker prices, and pick
up brochures, all without a hassle. You can also talk to
knowledgeable people about the models, again without giving your
name.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2. Set a budget:  &LR;  There are lots of beautiful cars, sport
utilities, minivans, and pickups in every price range. There's no
sense in going beyond your means for wheels. You can get almost all
the convenience features of the most expensive models in
lower-priced vehicles. Once you set a budget, figure out the
features you want _ and really need _ then see what models fit
within your budget. Don't forget to include maintenance and fuel in
your budget plans. Ask how much tuneups costs and how often they
are required. Remember sport utility vehicles are in most cases gas
hogs that could eat a hole in your pocket.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 3. Sit in the models:  &LR;  Sitting in a vehicle is a key to your
future enjoyment of the vehicle. If the vehicle is too high to get
into on the showroom floor, it will be worse when you have to do it
daily. If the seats don't feel comfortable, you won't be
comfortable on the road. How's the visibility. If you can't see all
around, you could be asking for trouble on the highway. Are the
controls easy to reach, logical, well lit for nighttime? Are there
convenient places to put the things you carry? If you are planning
on having passengers, is there room in the rear seat when your seat
is at your maximum comfort level?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 4. Drive them:  &LR;  Once you've narrowed your choices down, take
some test drives. Be sure the vehicle you test has the equipment
and engine you are planning on buying. Even so-called clones of
vehicles can ride and handle quite differently. General Motors
midsize models like the Oldsmobile Intrigue may share engines and
other mechanics with fellow GM lines, but they can drive and handle
quite differently. On the test drive, try roads like the ones you
drive on most frequently to get a sense of feel and speed. Do you
need fast acceleration to get on a highway? Never, never, never buy
any vehicle without a good test drive. Around the block doesn't
make it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 5. Compare:  &LR;  Many American makes are dubbing their models as
import fighters, claiming similar handling, performance and feel,
all at a lower price. It pays to check out features and price, then
take a test drive. You may find you can save a few thousand dollars
by going American. Even if you buy American, it pays to compare
makes from the same manufacturer. Buick has been billed as the best
built car in America, yet it shares parts with Oldsmobile, Pontiac,
and Chevrolet. Does this mean that the Buick, which comes off the
same assembly line as some of these others, gets special attention?
No. So compare it, and its features (GM gives its makes some
exclusive features, so if you want these you'll have to buy that
make), and you may find happiness and a lower price in a similar GM
model. On the Internet, there are services such as Autosite.com
that offer side-by-side comparisons of models.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 6. Get pricing:  &LR;  If you don't know the total cost of the
vehicle, including dealer cost, how can you make a wise buying
decision? There are many sources of this information. Consumer
Reports, AAA, and autosite.com provide low-cost printouts of any
model you may be considering. The beauty of these services is that
they also can let you know about any incentives or special deals on
a particular make or model. Even some 1999 models have
customer-buying incentives.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 7. Compare:  &LR;  Do this especially if you are torn between say a
car and a SUV. Yes, SUVs are ``in'' but do you really need one? I
keep itching to buy one, but at the last minute, I get practical. I
want one for winter driving; I want to go in any kind of weather.
But then, I look at my trusty front-drive car and realize I've
gotten through all these winters without one of those big brutes.
My front-drive car has pulled me through some tough winter
conditions. So, I reason, I really don't need a SUV with its high
fuel consumption. There are more cars and wagons with
all-wheel-drive that are as good if not better than some SUVs. If
front-drive won't do, check out a car with AWD.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 8. Buy or lease:  &LR;  Leasing a vehicle is tempting because of the
lower cost. Yes, the monthly payments are a lot lower, but there's
the cost of mileage. Leases are generally keyed to driving no more
than 12,000 or so miles a year. Go over that and you pay a penalty
of 15 cents or more per mile. You may be better off buying. Sure,
you may have to set your sights on a lower priced model, but it
will be yours (and the bank's) and you won't have to worry about
mileage or nicks and scratches when it is time to turn it in.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 9. Dealership or Internet:  &LR;  Many people have found buying on
the Internet can save thousands, but do you really want to buy a
vehicle from a distant and unknown dealership? If you've done your
homework and priced out the vehicle of your dreams, you could do
just as well near home.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 10. Avoid costly extras:  &LR;  When it comes to signing on the
dotted line, beware the extras the business manager will suggest or
put on the bill of sale. An extended warranty may be good if you're
putting lots of miles on the car, but otherwise its not necessary.
Beware also of extra service charges, ask what they are for. If
they seem out of line, go elsewhere.

MUSCLE CARS RETURN IN CIVILIZED STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R. WHITE  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time was when the auto industry sold cars on the basis of raw
power, cars with big engines sporting mucho cubes, lots of horses _
lingo for large displacement and high horsepower. It seems like
only yesterday ... well, actually it was only yesterday that you
probably heard an ad for a Ford F250 with a humungous V-10 or saw a
billboard touting somebody's new 300 horsepower performance sedan.
</P>
<P>
   Power is back. In spades. But today's muscle is a bit more
civilized than that of two decades ago. Despite oil embargoes,
threats of embargoes, wars and rumors of wars, ecologically
protective legislation, and technological revolution, the heady
attraction of the automobile remains its perceived power _ muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, we were told that the days of the
high-horsepower, gas-guzzling behemoth was over; the econobox and
sensible fuel economy would become the norm. Well, they were partly
right; the 1999 offerings, powerful though they may be, are vastly
more fuel efficient than anything even remotely imagined in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   What has changed is the engine technology; the motors of merely
20 years ago seem ancient artifacts compared to the
100,000-miles-between-tuneups, fuel-injected, computer-managed,
sensor-guided fuel-sippers of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   And style has changed; 20 years ago American families looked to
the V-8-powered, rear-drive station wagon as basic family
transport, vehicles with room for six and fuel appetites offering
14 to 17 miles per gallon. Today, the station wagon, where it still
exists, is a front-drive, four or five-passenger vehicle with a V-6
or smaller engine and fuel economy averaging 25 miles per gallon,
perhaps higher.
</P>
<P>
   The family workhorses today are vehicles virtually unknown 20
years ago _ the front-drive minivan _ six or seven passengers, lots
of room and maybe 25 to 30-something miles per gallon _ or the
sport utility, a label that encompasses a vast range of vehicles
accommodating four to six (sometimes more) people and consuming 12
to 14 m.p.g. in the case of the largest to maybe 25 m.p.g. for the
smallest. SUVs embrace all classes, from high-price Lexus, Lincoln,
and Cadilllac to humbler Toyota, Honda, and Jeep mini models _ not
to mention a V-8 all-wheel-drive van-look-alike Mercedes SUV.
</P>
<P>
   The SUV, in the main, is a truck-based passenger vehicle sitting
higher off the road than sedans, frequently with all-wheel or
four-wheel drive, usually designed more with off-road use in mind
rather than highway operation, and distinguished more for the
ability to evade federal regulation than the ability to evade
disaster in the hands of inexperienced or overly exuberant drivers.
The SUV is a product born of evasion; based on a truck chassis, it
is exempt from the federal fuel economy strictures and tailpipe
rules that led to the demise of the conventional station wagon _
the trucks come under somewhat more lenient rules that allow for
the power to do what wagons once did: carry things, pull trailers.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere between the late '70s rush to economy and now,
American families discovered that the econobox couldn't hack it in
a car pool, truck the trash to the dump, carry lumber and paint, or
even allow travel in comfort for many people. The many-strictured
sedan/coupe became too small to serve the tall, the wide, the
family. While the family boat could double as commuter vehicle,
albeit a thirsty one, a little commuter car couldn't carry the
family load.
</P>
<P>
   With the technology of today, however, the commuter vehicles
have gained in room and comfort while the bigger family vehicles
have gained substantially in fuel economy _ a sensible commuting
vehicle need no longer be a microcar. The compromise between
comfort and economy has been realized, but something else changed:
Fuel is cheap and plentiful again.
</P>
<P>
   The economy has prospered, more people are working, the price of
fuel has declined in real terms, and increased in abundance. In the
face of that abundance, America has again embraced excess _ trucks,
SUVs et al. now account for about half the automobile market.
</P>
<P>
   Something else is changing. Radically. New competition is
altering the face _ and the names _ of the industry. Chrysler, the
company that has come back from the dead too many times to count
and given us of late the bruiser Ram truck with V-10, a sports car
named Viper with a V-10, and a street rod called Prowler, has
joined its Pentastar with the Daimler-Benz Tristar _ you can call
the new company DaimlerChrysler, no hyphen, no space. On paper, it
is a perfect match of Benz high-end products with Chrysler
mass-marketed vehicles. Culturally, it is the Prussian Cavalry
meets the American Rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   Kia, a Korean auto company of some size, is about to emerge from
bankruptcy as an arm of Hyundai, another Korean maker.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has already acquired _ saved _ Jaguar, BMW owns Range
Rover, and that most venerable of British makers, Rolls-Royce, has
been torn asunder in a battle betwen BMW and Volkswagen. VW outbid
BMW with a last minute offer ``slid under the door,'' but the
purchase didn't include the trademarked name Rolls-Royce. BMW got
that from erstwhile parent Vickers _ BMW owns Rolls-Royce; VW owns
the factory and the rights to Bentley. Meanwhile, VW has looked
back to the future with a very modern Beetle.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors continues to shrink, is reorganizing yet again as
the ``leaner, meaner'' GM. Toyota and Ford have cash to weather
storms _ any chance of a merger here? Perhaps bits and pieces of a
troubled GM? No one comments, although one executive at Ford did
say: ``We look forward to making briliant acquisitions of badly
managed companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford has tightened its grip on stumbling partner, Mazda. Nissan
remains unprofitable despite good cars.
</P>
<P>
   Honda, which is almost an American company, even exporting
American-assembled cars to Japan, now threatens American supremacy
in the minivan business with the new Odyssey, a 210-horsepower
front-drive van with innovative and very versatile seating, two
sliding doors _ and 17 cupholders.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese invented the mini pickup. But, even as the
Americans perfected it and took back that market, Japanese
companies had been reluctant to move into heavy pickups. That's
changed. Say hello to the Toyota Tundra, that company's first
full-size, V-8-powered pickup and a challenge to the Ford F150,
Dodge Ram, and GM full-size models. The 245-horsepower Toyota,
available with four doors, is to be built in Indiana, not Japan.
</P>
<P>
   More hosepower, more doors, more cupholders _ these are the
modern challenges. Ford, Chrysler, and GM all offer four-door
pickups and vans with sliding doors on both sides. When the
distinctions blur, you can always count the cupholders.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler's slogan best sums up the auto business in 1999:
``Everything's changed. Again.''

MINIVANS AND WAGONS STILL FAMILY FAVORITES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While it may seem that sport-utility vehicles are about to
overrun the highways, the minivan is still a stalwart means of
transportation for many a family. Both foreign and domestic
companies are cranking out these practical vehicles, giving the
consumer a wide array of styles, options, and prices.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, this year, the king of minivans _ Chrysler _ is about to
get some real competition from Honda, whose Odyssey ($23,800) looks
like a case of minivan one-upmanship.
</P>
<P>
   It's got everything the other minivans have (except
all-wheel-drive) and more. It's larger than anything Honda has ever
offered, comes with two sliding doors (both powered in the EX
model), and more seat configurations _ the rear seat can be folded
flat on the floor, the second row of seats can be put together to
form a bench seat, there's even a folding tray between the front
seats, and with the seats out there's room for a 4 x 8-foot sheet
of plywood. With the seats in, it will carry seven in comfort.
There's a traction control system available, front and rear air
conditioning, and a new smooth operating transmission.
</P>
<P>
   If it's a good old-fashioned station wagon your after for
hauling the kids and the groceries, you'll be hard pressed to find
a domestic solution. American manufacturers have just about dropped
the station wagon.
</P>
<P>
   However, foreign makers seem to be picking up the slack. Volvo
and Subaru, who have been manufacturing wagons for years, are
continuing to offer them, and BMW and Mercedes, both of whom have
gone back and forth with them in the US market, have models this
year, and Saab is about to introduce one.
</P>
<P>
   For some consumers, especially those who find sport-utility
vehicles big, high-riding gas guzzlers, wagons and minvans make
good alternatives. For those who want some SUV features like
all-wheel-drive and space, there are minivans and wagons that meet
the challenge and also offer good gas mileage, nice lines, and
great performance.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford Windstar ($19,200), for example, has been redesigned to
include two sliding doors, and it is the first minivan to offer
dual power-operated doors. Other features include a reverse sensing
system to warn of objects at the rear of the vehicle, head and
chest side-impact airbags, and a V-6 engine that Ford says makes
this the cleanest gasoline-powered minivan available. All of this
is accomplished, says Ford, without sacrificing power.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury Villager/Nissan Quest ($22,995), considered among
the smaller minivans, have added space for '99. Both vehicles
stress carlike feel, add a fourth door (sliding on the driver's
side), and have been enlarged by 5 inches for added cargo and
passenger room.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Chrysler remains well ahead of the pack with its
minivans, which are well designed to accommodate six to eight
passengers and cargo. They handle well and do have a carlike feel.
You can choose from the basic, reasonably priced Plymouth Voyager
($17,500), decide between the Dodge Caravan ($17,500) and the Grand
Caravan ($20,200) _ 13.3 inches longer _ or the ultimate, the
Chrysler Town &AMP; Country ($34,115). Both the Town &AMP; Country and the
Dodge Caravan can be equipped with all-wheel-drive along with such
amenities as dual front climate zones, and heated leather seats.
</P>
<P>
   Minivans seem to be moving into the luxury market based on
Chrysler's success. Oldsmobile's Silhouette Premiere ($31,175) is
like taking your family room with you. There's a videocassette
recorder, overhead color monitor, compact disk player, and
headphones for six, each with its own volume control.
</P>
<P>
   Pontiac is playing up ruggedness in its new Montana ($21,700)
minivan. You've probably seen those cowboys popping in and out of
it on TV. Unfortunately, the Montana doesn't come with
all-wheel-drive.
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet offers a sibling of these GM models in the Venture
($20,250).
</P>
<P>
   Other minivans include the Isuzu Oasis ($23,500), a small model
that is built by Honda.
</P>
<P>
   The old station wagon has gotten some up-to-date features. Many
companies, for example, have added all-wheel-drive to their wagons.
This makes them a good alternative to sport-utility vehicles since
they handle better, are more stable, and, some say, even look
better than most SUVs. A wagon can also offer as much cargo space
as a sport utility.
</P>
<P>
   Audi just introduced the A6 Avant ($35,000), a sleek, luxurious
wagon that's at home in the city or on a camping trip. (With the
rear seats down, there's room enough to put a couple of sleeping
bags inside). The wagon is loaded with nice touches, including
Tiptronic _ a transmission that allows one to shift through the
gears without a clutch, and can also be used as an automatic.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo offers all-wheel-drive in its V70 wagon ($34,400). This
vehicle not only offers all the comforts of home, but can be a
powerhouse on the road. It also sits nearly as high off the road as
a SUV.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes-Benz features a road-hugging all-wheel-drive wagon in
its E-Class. The E320 wagon goes for around $47,400.
</P>
<P>
   Subaru offers only all-wheel-drive in its vehicles. It offers
the Forester ($18,700), the larger Legacy ($19,200), and the
Outback ($24,600), which has more ground clearance that the Legacy
line. New this year to the Legacy line is a SUS Limited ($24,900),
which adds many luxury touches from leather seats to power sunroof.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen also features AWD in its Passat ($23,000) wagon. It
shares many of its power and handling traits with Audi, making the
VW version a better buy.
</P>
<P>
   Saab is entering the wagon field in the spring with a new 9-5
model. It, like models from Ford, Mercury, Honda, Toyota and
others, will not have AWD.

EVERYBODY LOVES A PICKUP TRUCK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's nothing like having a pickup truck. With pickups
becoming more carlike, and roomier, they fit nicely into many a
buyer's lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   My neighbor said he finally saw the light, and replaced his
compact car with a compact Chevrolet pickup. Between remodeling the
house, and trips to the dump he decided the pickup would better
suit his needs and his daily commute to work. Since there already
was a larger family car, the small backseat in his former car got
little use and the pickup bed was far more practical.
</P>
<P>
   For 1999, Chevrolet and GMC have a new line of trucks that
definitely are more carlike in many features, more powerful, and
offer added conveniences.
</P>
<P>
   The Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra lines are full-size
pickups that come in standard and extended cabs with a choice of
three engines. A standard third door is offered on all extended
cabs. The trucks come with a wider track, in front and back, to
stabilize loads.
</P>
<P>
   Both trucks feature rack and pinion steering, a first for a
full-size truck. The system, similar to that in most cars, gives a
more precise feel to the steering. Engineers have avoided using
this system in trucks because they believed the system was not
durable under heavy use. GM says its system can take the
punishment, but will offer it only on half-ton, two-wheel drive
models. Also featured is AutoTrac, an automatic four-wheel-drive
system. The system can also be activated at the touch of a dash
button.
</P>
<P>
   Both vehicles offer four-wheel disk brakes, with larger pads and
rotors. Also featured is a new generation of Vortec V-8 engine _
one, a 6.0-liter, develops 300 horsepower, challenging Dodge, which
until now had the largest engine in its truck class.
</P>
<P>
   Chevy also has the S10 pickup with an Extreme package that
lowers the vehicle two inches and features full ground effects and
wheel flares. It also has a sport suspension and enhanced
transmission.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing GM didn't put on these new models is a fourth
door, which is the rage of the truck world. GM says a fourth door
will be on the 2000 models.
</P>
<P>
   The pickup, an American institution, may be getting some hot
competition in the near future. Toyota will start selling its first
full-sized pickup, the Tundra, next spring. This American-built
truck will feature a 245-horsepower V-8, with more power than a
standard Ford F-150. For now, Toyota just offers its compact
Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, however, is boosting power options for 1999. Its
top-selling F-Series pickups now come with an optional 235- to
265-horsepower V-8, and added a smooth 275-horsepower V-10 to its
heavy duty line.
</P>
<P>
   Ford offers four doors as standard equipment on all its SuperCab
F-Series models, and a four-door SuperCab is an option on its
Ranger series. The F-Series also offer a nice snap-free,
factory-installed tonneau cover for the truck bed.
</P>
<P>
   Dodge gives its larger than compact Dakota models larger wheels
for 1999 along with added trim features including optional radio
controls on the steering wheel. Four engine choices are offered.
Standard or club cab versions are offered.
</P>
<P>
   The full-size Dodge Ram comes as a two-door standard-cab or a
four-door club-cab version. More convenience options are also on
tap for this year.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan has a new compact pickup, the Frontier, with a very
refined V-6 from the Quest minivan. With the automatic, the
Frontier has a towing capacity of 5,000 pounds. It is also offered
in a four-wheel-drive King Cab model.
</P>
<P>
   Mazda now has a four-door option on its B-series small pickups.
Another option is a V-6 engine.
</P>
<P>
   The quest for more doors isn't ending. Nissan reportedly will
show a concept pickup with five doors at the Detroit auto show in
January. The fifth door will be a hinged rear liftgate at the back
of the cabin. When opened, the fifth door extends the pickup bed
into the cab for longer loads.

SAFETY FEATURES TOP CONSUMER LISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a time when auto makers could not seem to sell safety
to customers. How the times have changed.
</P>
<P>
   Now some manufacturers are almost playing one-upmanship in the
safety world. Volvo has become a name synonymous with safe
vehicles, but other makers are saying, ``Hey, Volvo's not the only
company making safe vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   Saab, which has won Swedish awards for safety, has decided not
to take a back seat. It is letting people know it has built, and
continues to build, safe vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   At a presentation, Saab engineers showed how &UR;  &LR; the company builds
cars not for government-mandated crash tests but for ``real life''
situations, with crumple zones within the vehicle effective if the
car is hit on an angle, not just straight on as in federal tests.
</P>
<P>
   BMW and Mercedes-Benz are also getting out the message. Mercedes
has developed a number of safety features over the years that the
company freely allows others to copy. When it comes to a safe
vehicle, driving a Mercedes has been compared to driving a tank.
It's a solid vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is promoting its Windstar minivan as a safe vehicle. It
received the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's
five-star award in crash test ratings. The only other minivan to
receive the award is the '98 Toyota Sienna. Windstar offers such
added features as standard foam and cushioning in the ceiling and
window pillars to help reduce head injuries in a crash.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford minivan comes with two options for even safer driving:
side airbags designed for front-seat passengers to cushion both the
head and torso in a side crash, and a reverse-sensing system that
starts beeping when the bumper is 5.9 feet away from an obstacle
and sounds more frequently as the vehicle gets closer to the
object. The beeping is heard only inside the minivan.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all cars and most trucks now have dual front air bags as
standard equipment. More air bags, though, are on the way. Since
their introduction a couple of years ago, side airbags are
beginning to show up in more and more vehicles. The bags are
mounted either in the front door panels or on the side of the front
seats.
</P>
<P>
   With the controversy over injuries and, in some cases, deaths as
the result of airbag deployments, a number of vehicles now are
equipped with ``second generation'' bags. These units tend not to
explode with the force of earlier versions.
</P>
<P>
   Another recent change came about because of injuries and deaths
to children caused by air bags activating in the front seat. Many
trucks, which tend to have only one seat, are now equipped with
key-operated shut offs for the front passenger side air bag to
prevent such injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes-Benz is now offering its Baby-Smart seat system in all
models. When a baby seat that Mercedes offers is placed in the
front, a sensor deactivates the air bag on that side of the car.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo added air bag ``curtains'' to
some models. The curtains cover just about the entire door. BMW
offers a tube-like airbag that extends across the top of the front
doors to help protect the heads of front-seat passengers.
</P>
<P>
   As of Sept. 1, manufacturers were required to add extra padding
around windows to protect against head injuries. The National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration said the new curtain-style
airbags are innovative technology that surpass the extra padding
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Side-impact airbags have already found their way into low-priced
cars such as the Toyota Corolla. Some luxury makers are also adding
these for rear seat passengers. For true safety, however, the use
of seat belts to hold driver and passengers in place is a key
element. Relying on the air bags alone won't do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   Seat belts have also been greatly improved both for comfort and
for holding one in place in the event of a sudden stop.
</P>
<P>
   Some makers are giving added protection to avoid whiplash
injuries. Volvo has a new whiplash Protection System allowing the
seat backrest and head restraint to shift backward during rear-end
collisions. The system, Volvo says, reduces the force resulting
from rear impact by 50 percent. Saab also offers a similar system.
</P>
<P>
   Many luxury vehicles are providing driver-systems that sense
steering and traction conditions and automatically adjust to
prevent spinouts. BMW is including one in its new 3-Series.
</P>
<P>
   Antilock brakes have been hailed as almost more important in
preventing accidents than airbags. The brakes are intended to
prevent cars from skidding on slippery surfaces during a sudden
stop and to aid in stopping faster.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with antilock brakes is many people don't know how
to use them. Unlike regular brakes, which many drivers learned to
pump in emergencies, antilock brakes do the pumping automatically.
Drivers pumping antilock brakes make them less effective.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes-Benz now has a system called Brake-Assist that uses a
computer to determine when the use of the brakes is an emergency.
When this situation occurs, the computer automatically adds extra
pressure to the brakes. Mercedes says stopping distances can be
reduced by up to 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Without proper and well-maintained tires on the vehicle, no
brake is going to stop the car or truck effectively. Having the
right tires for your make and model and having them properly
inflated are very important, in even the simplest of stops.
</P>
<P>
   Corvette was one of the first to offer a device that warns of
low air pressure. The feature can now be found on other General
Motors makes. The system is tied to the antilock brake system. When
a sensor detects a loss of air, it triggers a warning light on the
instrument panel indicating which tire is low.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping by the side of the road to repair a flat tire can be
one of the most dangerous things a motorist can do There are too
many reports of motorists changing tires being struck by a passing
vehicle. Some '99s are coming with tires that are capable of
running for a while with a complete loss of air _ long enough to
find help or a safe place off the highway to change the tire.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a better grip on the road is what all-wheel-drive is
about. With AWD _ not four-wheel-drive _ power is shifted to the
wheel or wheels needing it most. Even if traction is lost on three
wheels, new systems from Jeep and Mercedes will shift the power to
the one wheel with traction, keeping the vehicle from skidding on
ice or snow.
</P>
<P>
   AWD, once a feature associated with sport-utility vehicles, is
now available in sedans and wagons from Subaru, Volvo, and
Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   Another new safety feature expected to be adapted by many
manufacturers is blue-tint headlights designed to give drivers
better road sight at night. High-intensity discharge, or HID,
headlights illuminate by creating an electric arc between two
electrodes in a bulb filled with xenon gas. These new lights have
been designed to help older drivers see better.

<TEXT>
<P>
   What's an Alero? A Daewoo? An Escalade? Is that BMW a car from
the past, or present? The 300? Haven't we heard that name before?
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the new car model year is upon us, loaded with new names,
new companies, and adding more confusion for those trying to decide
what to buy or not to buy.
</P>
<P>
   So what's hot this year?
</P>
<P>
   Safety is very in. So are coupes. Horsepower is up. Prices,
though, are stable. Most manufacturers are holding the line on
prices, and some, like Ford, have dropped prices on some models by
up to $2,000. Mercedes-Benz has boosted prices by less than 2
percent, but when additional equipment on the new models is figured
in, the 1999 model prices are lower than similar 1998s.
</P>
<P>
   It's going to be an interesting model year for both consumers
and manufacturers. Consumers have the ``problem'' of more choices
at more price points. For manufacturers, the year is a gamble: How
will the new models play in such a fickle market, and will the
economy slow sales?
</P>
<P>
   The choices for 1999 keep growing. And, with each new model the
manufacturers predict their sales will jump by anywhere from a few
thousand to a hundred thousand. With all these predictions of sales
increases, someone has to lose.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't stopped Daewoo, a Korean manufacturer, from entering
the American market. Daewoo started as a textile company, and
didn't start building cars under its own name until 1992. After
success in Europe and South America, Daewoo is here with an
unconventional game plan: Hire college students to market cars that
are underpriced, offer no-hassle sales, and a three-year
free-maintenance program.
</P>
<P>
   With models at the low ($9,000-$12,000), medium
($12,000-$14,000), and higher price ($15,000-$20,000) price ranges,
the Daewoos are quite nice. But unless you know a college student
in the Boston area, or head out to Natick, you may not easily
locate one of these models. Daewoo is marketing the cars in a
limited number of cities across the country, primarily in major
university areas; there are also company dealerships in Rhode
Island and Connecticut. Still Daewoo faces the same obstacle as
other companies: There are a lot of good vehicles out there, and a
lot of hot models for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Oldsmobile, once a major player in the auto world, has high
hopes for its low-priced entry model, the Alero. Volkswagen is on a
roll. Since reintroducing its cute little Beetle in January, the
company is coming out with more new models, from the Golf to a new
Passat. Saab just introduced the 9-5, replacing its aging 9000
series. At the New England International Automobile Show, the
company will show off a wagon version of the 9-5 that will be sold
beginning next spring. Chrysler has reached into its past to bring
out the 300M, a stylish and hot performing sedan. Infiniti is
looking to lure more buyers its way with the new entry-level luxury
G20 sedan. Volvo has an all-new S80 sedan that has style and
performance, and is packed with safety features.
</P>
<P>
   The sport-utility market gets bigger with each passing day. For
the first time in its 96-year history, Cadillac has a sport utility
vehicle of its own, the Escalade. Every manufacturer sees a SUV in
its future, it seems.
</P>
<P>
   For Cadillac, it's the numbers game. The luxury car maker was
losing sales to Lincoln ever since that company came out with its
SUV, the Navigator. Lexus now has almost 40 percent of its sales in
its SUV, the RX 300. Mercedes-Benz can't keep up with the demand
for its highly rated ML320.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of these monstrous gas gulping vehicles defies
convention. Designed (and advertised) as rugged all-terrain
transportation, they are rarely used off road, according to surveys
of owners.
</P>
<P>
   But they're hot.
</P>
<P>
   And if the Caddy or Lincoln versions are too big, Honda, Toyota,
Isuzu, and Kia have smaller, less costly models. Suzuki has a new
mini-SUV in the Grand Vitara that offers more power and space for
its class than any of its competitors. Jeep, the name most
associated with SUVs, isn't sitting by idly. Chrysler has an
all-new Jeep Grand Cherokee this year. The company has spent more
than $2 billion on this baby, including beefing up the
manufacturing process to produce even more to meet the demand.
</P>
<P>
   Because SUVs stand high off the ground, there are some safety
concerns on cornering. Land Rover has an optional device on its new
Discovery that reportedly cuts the sway feeling.
</P>
<P>
   In the minivan field, it's all doors and new competition for the
dominant Chrysler. Dual-passenger and driver's-side sliding doors
are in _ Windstar now has them, so too does the Mercury
Villager/Nissan Quest. And, if they're power driven, all the
better.
</P>
<P>
   The Honda Odyssey offers an all-new way to look at minivans,
from performance to use of space inside for seating and cargo. The
Odyssey is real competition for Chrysler and Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Doors are big news on trucks as well. GMC and Chevy have new
truck models to give Ford a run for the money. And, like Ford
models, these vehicles have added doors that open out for more
practical interior use of space.
</P>
<P>
   But 1999 is not all SUVs and minivans. It is the year of the
coupe. Toyota has the Solara, based on, but nothing like, the
Camry. BMW has an eye-catching M3 coupe; it has a long hood and
short body, but, oh, does it go. There's a coupe for every pocket,
in every style, from just about every manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the industry, there are new engines, more horsepower,
and added safety features. There's no question that air bags save
lives, the problem is that they could also injure or kill
motorists. Many manufacturers are now offering ``second
generation'' bags that inflate with less impact. Side airbags are
becoming more available. New this year are side curtain-like bags
for added protection. Saab has a new Active Head Restraint system
to protect front passengers from whiplash injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Small people with big vehicles have a friend in Ford. The
company is offering adjustable pedals for braking and acceleration.
The pedals can be adjusted up to 3 inches, making them easier to
reach.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to seating, there are some new ideas out there.
More companies are offering the option of having heated front (some
rear as well) seats, but Saab also has a ventilated front seat for
drivers. And, if that's not good enough, Cadillac has a seat that
massages.
</P>
<P>
   The auto world is changing in the way cars are designed and the
way they're sold. Using the Internet to buy cars is becoming more
popular, and companies are pushing dealerships to become more
customer friendly. Some of the big names _ Ford and General Motors
_ are looking to consolidate dealerships. Ford is experimenting
with not only consolidating all the dealerships in some cities, but
also owning them.

SINCLAIR GATHERS FRUSTRATED SEAHAWKS TO AIR OUT EMOTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ With the lingering frustration from an
embarrassing loss to the Oakland Raiders threatening to shake the
Seahawks to their foundation, Michael Sinclair wanted to make sure
no cracks were allowed to form.
</P>
<P>
   Sinclair, a Pro Bowl defensive end, defensive co-captain and one
of three players remaining from the 2-14 season of 1992, called a
players-only meeting Wednesday because he felt ``the glue was
starting to come undone.''
</P>
<P>
   The gathering of perplexed players took place after the team's
customary Wednesday morning meeting with the coaching staff. It
lasted 15 minutes and Sinclair was the only player who spoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was real emotional,'' Sinclair said after a practice that
was labeled the best of the season by several other players. ``It's
all out. It's all behind us. The guys responded real well.''
</P>
<P>
   But one zealous meeting and one zesty practice do not a total
turnaround make. The Seahawks are 4-4 entering Sunday's game
against the Kansas City Chiefs because they have lost four of the
past five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only one practice,'' guard Pete Kendall said. ``If we
practice great all week and then go out and play like we did last
Sunday, then it's all for naught. The only thing that's going to
make this locker room better is winning.''
</P>
<P>
   In the emotional moments after the 31-18 loss to the Raiders on
Sunday night, linebacker Chad Brown questioned the accountability
of the team _ from coach Dennis Erickson, to the other members of a
defense that has played well enough to win each of the first eight
games, to himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was talk out of frustration, but you know if that lingers
...,'' Sinclair offered, without completing his thought. ``That's
why it was necessary to call the meeting to say, `You know what,
guys? We need to shake up the tree a little bit.'''
</P>
<P>
   Brown declined comment Wednesday, offering only, ``I think I've
already said enough.'' But his remarks, rooted in frustration, got
to the root of a lingering problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the things Chad said were very constructive,''
quarterback Warren Moon said. ``They weren't pointed at any one
person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you would hope those things would just be said in
the locker room,'' Moon said. ``But if they're said out of
frustration to the media, we would much rather know about it before
the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown couldn't continue to harness the frustration that comes
from being part of a team that has so much talent and so little to
show for it.
</P>
<P>
   Sinclair agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep saying, `OK, we're not the same team. We're not the
same team.' Yet we're putting up the same results,'' Sinclair said.
``What's behind that?''
</P>
<P>
   The easy out is to blame Erickson. But Moon said that's too
easy. It is not Erickson who has turned the ball over 14 times in
the team's four losses, compared to just twice in the four wins. It
is not Erickson who has dropped passes or jumped offsides to stall
drives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those coaches can't go on the field for us,'' Moon said. ``I
think they give us a good enough plan and ... we as players have to
do a better job of executing the whole plan and turning that into a
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to panic. It's too early to start
second-guessing people. It's too early to start talking about
coaching changes.''
</P>
<P>
   But the pressure is on Erickson, who knows he needs to get this
team into the playoffs to assure returning to coach the final
season of the five-year deal he signed in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a situation now where the pressure doesn't get much
more than this,'' Erickson said. ``There's speculation out there. I
can read. ... That doesn't bother me. All I can do as Dennis
Erickson is my job, and that's to coach this football team and get
them ready to play this game. So that's what we're doing right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Seahawks need right now is a win. But to get it, they
will have to exorcise a Chiefs team that has been their own
personal demon. The Seahawks have lost seven straight and 14 of the
past 15 to the Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to understand, the Chiefs' mentality is that they
get back on the winning track this Sunday when they play us,''
Sinclair said. ``We've got to come in and say, `You know what? No.
We get back on the winning track.'''

BROTHERS' FORMULA: GOP LOOKS TO BUSHES FOR CLUES TO WINNING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ One calls himself a compassionate
conservative. The other says he's a multicultural Republican.
Whatever it's called, the Bush brothers may have found a winning
formula for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   As GOP leaders assessed damage in congressional races, some
looked South for clues to the party's future. The impressive
victories by Gov. George W. Bush in Texas and Gov.-elect Jeb Bush
in Florida were among the few bright spots in an election filled
with Republican disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   While several conservative stalwarts were tossed out of office,
the Bushes scored solid wins by reaching beyond the white
conservative GOP base. Both brothers tempered their conservative
rhetoric in appealing to more moderate voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Republican Party does not get the message that the Bush
brothers have found the way out of the wilderness for them, they
deserve the moniker of stupid party,'' said Larry Sabato, a
political scientist at the University of Virginia. ``It is as
obvious as a wart on the nose of Miss America.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bush brothers are the hottest thing since hula hoops,''
said Jim Wilkinson, a spokesman for House Majority Leader Dick
Armey of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But even as they praised the Bushes, Republicans offered
different interpretations of their victories. To some, the lesson
is that Republicans should tone down their conservative message.
Others argued that the Bushes proved that conservative ideas have
broad appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Tate, head of the Christian Coalition, said the Bush
victories show conservatives can win by taking their agenda to
groups that do not normally vote Republican.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, George W. Bush captured 49 percent of the Hispanic
vote, 27 percent of the African-American vote and 65 percent of
female voters _ a remarkable showing for a Republican conservative.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, Jeb Bush reached out to traditionally Democratic
voters in the state's African-American and Jewish communities. He
captured about 60 percent of Florida's Hispanic vote, which is
dominated by Republican Cuban-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's a message to conservatives across the country,
that you need to reach out to people across the political
spectrum,'' Tate said. ``It wasn't running away from issues. It was
reaching a consensus and reaching out and casting a broader net.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Tate chastised Republican leaders in Congress
for not aggressively pursuing a conservative agenda. He said many
conservative Christians abandoned the party in Tuesday's elections
because of their disappointment with the Republican-controlled
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people aren't just wind-up dolls. Conservative leaders
need to address our issues,'' he said. ``Running away from our
agenda is a recipe for bad results on Election Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls showed that voter turnout among self-described
conservatives was down about 2 percent from 1994, when Republicans
captured control of Congress with a conservative agenda known as
the Contract With America.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the trend appeared to favor more moderate candidates.
Some of the defeated Republicans, including South Carolina Gov.
David Beasley, Alabama Gov. Fob James and Sen. Lauch Faircloth of
North Carolina, came to office with strong ties to Christian
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Newt Gingrich said the lesson is that Republicans should
concentrate on issues that have broad appeal, including tax cuts
and shoring up the Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans have to decide if we're going to truly be a
majority party,'' he said. ``A true majority party in America
reaches out to all Americans. The Bush family clearly is moving in
the right direction.''

   HOME-TRENDS _ HIGH POINT, N.C. _ When you pay big bucks for
furniture, the last thing you want is for it to suddenly look
outdated several years from now. That's why it helps to know some
of the directions furniture manufacturers are following. The fall
International Home Furnishings Market, the wholesale trade expo
where new lines get their first showing, provided a road map. And
that's significant when you consider the market includes some 2,300
manufacturers consuming 8 million square feet of showroom space in
160 buildings. The newest merchandise, to begin appearing in stores
early next year, is expected to emphasize Asian influences, the
casual cottage and world travel looks, and, as the century draws to
a close, a retro or ``urban eclectic'' feel. (Flanders,Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 22.

   COTTAGEGARDEN-FURNITURE _ Artist Thomas Kinkade teams up with

   HOME-TRENDS _ HIGH POINT, N.C. _ When you pay big bucks for
furniture, the last thing you want is for it to suddenly look
outdated several years from now. That's why it helps to know some
of the directions furniture manufacturers are following. The fall
International Home Furnishings Market, the wholesale trade expo
where new lines get their first showing, provided a road map. And
that's significant when you consider the market includes some 2,300
manufacturers consuming 8 million square feet of showroom space in
160 buildings. The newest merchandise, to begin appearing in stores
early next year, is expected to emphasize Asian influences, the
casual cottage and world travel looks, and, as the century draws to

MINIVANS AND WAGONS STILL FAMILY FAVORITES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While it may seem that sport-utility vehicles are about to
overrun the highways, the minivan is still a stalwart means of
transportation for many a family. Both foreign and domestic
companies are cranking out these practical vehicles, giving the
consumer a wide array of styles, options, and prices.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, this year, the king of minivans _ Chrysler _ is about to
get some real competition from Honda, whose Odyssey ($23,800) looks
like a case of minivan one-upmanship.
</P>
<P>
   It's got everything the other minivans have (except
all-wheel-drive) and more. It's larger than anything Honda has ever
offered, comes with two sliding doors (both powered in the EX
model), and more seat configurations _ the rear seat can be folded
flat on the floor, the second row of seats can be put together to
form a bench seat, there's even a folding tray between the front
seats, and with the seats out there's room for a 4 x 8-foot sheet
of plywood. With the seats in, it will carry seven in comfort.
There's a traction control system available, front and rear air
conditioning, and a new smooth operating transmission.
</P>
<P>
   If it's a good old-fashioned station wagon your after for
hauling the kids and the groceries, you'll be hard pressed to find
a domestic solution. American manufacturers have just about dropped
the station wagon.
</P>
<P>
   However, foreign makers seem to be picking up the slack. Volvo
and Subaru, who have been manufacturing wagons for years, are
continuing to offer them, and BMW and Mercedes, both of whom have
gone back and forth with them in the US market, have models this
year, and Saab is about to introduce one.
</P>
<P>
   For some consumers, especially those who find sport-utility
vehicles big, high-riding gas guzzlers, wagons and minvans make
good alternatives. For those who want some SUV features like
all-wheel-drive and space, there are minivans and wagons that meet
the challenge and also offer good gas mileage, nice lines, and
great performance.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford Windstar ($19,200), for example, has been redesigned to
include two sliding doors, and it is the first minivan to offer
dual power-operated doors. Other features include a reverse sensing
system to warn of objects at the rear of the vehicle, head and
chest side-impact airbags, and a V-6 engine that Ford says makes
this the cleanest gasoline-powered minivan available. All of this
is accomplished, says Ford, without sacrificing power.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury Villager/Nissan Quest ($22,995), considered among
the smaller minivans, have added space for '99. Both vehicles
stress carlike feel, add a fourth door (sliding on the driver's
side), and have been enlarged by 5 inches for added cargo and
passenger room.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Chrysler remains well ahead of the pack with its
minivans, which are well designed to accommodate six to eight
passengers and cargo. They handle well and do have a carlike feel.
You can choose from the basic, reasonably priced Plymouth Voyager
($17,500), decide between the Dodge Caravan ($17,500) and the Grand
Caravan ($20,200) _ 13.3 inches longer _ or the ultimate, the
Chrysler Town &AMP; Country ($34,115). Both the Town &AMP; Country and the
Dodge Caravan can be equipped with all-wheel-drive along with such
amenities as dual front climate zones, and heated leather seats.
</P>
<P>
   Minivans seem to be moving into the luxury market based on
Chrysler's success. Oldsmobile's Silhouette Premiere ($31,175) is
like taking your family room with you. There's a videocassette
recorder, overhead color monitor, compact disk player, and
headphones for six, each with its own volume control.
</P>
<P>
   Pontiac is playing up ruggedness in its new Montana ($21,700)
minivan. You've probably seen those cowboys popping in and out of
it on TV. Unfortunately, the Montana doesn't come with
all-wheel-drive.
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet offers a sibling of these GM models in the Venture
($20,250).
</P>
<P>
   Other minivans include the Isuzu Oasis ($23,500), a small model
that is built by Honda.
</P>
<P>
   The old station wagon has gotten some up-to-date features. Many
companies, for example, have added all-wheel-drive to their wagons.
This makes them a good alternative to sport-utility vehicles since
they handle better, are more stable, and, some say, even look
better than most SUVs. A wagon can also offer as much cargo space
as a sport utility.
</P>
<P>
   Audi just introduced the A6 Avant ($35,000), a sleek, luxurious
wagon that's at home in the city or on a camping trip. (With the
rear seats down, there's room enough to put a couple of sleeping
bags inside). The wagon is loaded with nice touches, including
Tiptronic _ a transmission that allows one to shift through the
gears without a clutch, and can also be used as an automatic.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo offers all-wheel-drive in its V70 wagon ($34,400). This
vehicle not only offers all the comforts of home, but can be a
powerhouse on the road. It also sits nearly as high off the road as
a SUV.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes-Benz features a road-hugging all-wheel-drive wagon in
its E-Class. The E320 wagon goes for around $47,400.
</P>
<P>
   Subaru offers only all-wheel-drive in its vehicles. It offers
the Forester ($18,700), the larger Legacy ($19,200), and the
Outback ($24,600), which has more ground clearance that the Legacy
line. New this year to the Legacy line is a SUS Limited ($24,900),
which adds many luxury touches from leather seats to power sunroof.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen also features AWD in its Passat ($23,000) wagon. It
shares many of its power and handling traits with Audi, making the
VW version a better buy.
</P>
<P>
   Saab is entering the wagon field in the spring with a new 9-5
model. It, like models from Ford, Mercury, Honda, Toyota and
others, will not have AWD.

SPORT UTILITY VEHICLES REMAIN TOP SELLERS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   OK, how many ways can you say ``sport utility''? Plenty, would
seem to be the answer as more car makers add sport utility models
to their lineup. And, there are hints that even more makers are
about to enter the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Lexus added to its '99 sport utility lineup earlier this year
with the RX 300. Now, Cadillac joins in with the Escalade, Suzuki
adds the Grand Vitara, and there's even one from Quigley.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley?
</P>
<P>
   Well, more about that later.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen and Porsche are planning a joint venture, BMW is said
to be working on one, Saab is looking for one, Saturn is giving
thoughts to having one and Daewoo, which just entered the American
market, reportedly has one in its future.
</P>
<P>
   Jeep certainly isn't sitting by. It has an all-new Grand
Cherokee that's bigger, roomier, more powerful, and with a new
all-wheel-drive train. Reportedly the only things being picked up
from the '98 version are 127 screws.
</P>
<P>
   If there are not already a lot of choices in models, consider,
too, that not all sport utility vehicles are alike. Which means
anyone looking for a SUV has a lot of shopping ahead _ not just for
price, but for features as well. Do you want full-time four-wheel
drive, or do you really want all-wheel drive? Do you want a low
range for off-road adventure, or a choice of two-wheel, four-wheel
drive? Do you want room to spare? Do you want to feel the ruts or
ride in carlike comfort? How high off the road do you want to be?
How easy is it to shift between drives? What's the noise level
inside like? How does it feel going around a corner? (Some SUVs,
especially some of the smaller ones, give the feeling of an
impending rollover. If it doesn't feel right, don't go for it.)
These are questions you should answer before putting your money
down.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys have shown that more than 95 percent of sport-utility
owners never go off-road. They simply use them for shopping,
commuting, hauling the kids, a boat or a trailer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for auto dealers, a SUV or two on the lot is a must.
That's one reason Cadillac, for the first time in its 96-year
history, is putting its name on a truck. Sales of the Lincoln
Navigator were too much for Cadillac to bear, it needed something
to keep its flock in the Cadillac tent. Enter the Cadillac
Escalade.
</P>
<P>
   The Escalade is basically an even fancier, smoother-riding
version of the Chevrolet Tahoe and GMC Yukon and Denali. It's not
as huge as the Lincoln Navigator but it has plenty of power in its
255 horsepower engine, and can make grand music with its Bose
Acoustimass sound system.
</P>
<P>
   The Jeep Grand Cherokee, its fans say, leaves almost nothing to
desire. The new Grand Cherokee may look a lot like the old, but its
a far different riding, handling, all-around vehicle. Some have
reported it outclasses the Mercedes M-Class, and Chrysler
reportedly was going to promote that, until they became part of the
Mercedes family. Make your own comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   There's just about nothing Chrysler didn't change on the '99.
There's a new engine, new all-wheel-drive system, more room, new
seats, new transmission, well, it's all new. Even the spare tire
has been taken out of the cargo area and placed under the vehicle.
Chrysler hasn't missed a trick _ it spend $2.65 billion, including
$750 million in plant preparation.
</P>
<P>
   The new Quadra-Drive system is designed to keep the Jeep going
even if three wheels lose traction. It has a new suspension
designed for better ride and handling. And its new 16-valve,
4.7-liter V-8 is said to offer better mileage, and 30 percent less
emissions. Add to that a long list of luxury items, including dual
climate zones, and you have quite a vehicle to go just about
anywhere. The Laredo version starts at $26,220, the Limited at
$34,415 for the four-wheel drive version.
</P>
<P>
   The luxury market for SUVs is growing. General Motors added the
Denali last spring, loading it with lots of amenities to set it
apart from the GMC Yukon. Its one-price comes with just about
everything. The same is true of GMC's new top-of-the-line,
everything-included Envoy, which has features not available in any
other GM SUV product. It's nicely styled and equipped. While lots
of manufacturers are citing the ``carlike'' ride of their SUVs, GM
is stressing the ``trucklike'' strength of their models, which may
have a carlike ride, but are built on truck frames.
</P>
<P>
   Lexus entered the SUV market last March with the RX300
($31,500), and like other Lexus products, shows a lot of innovation
along with comfort features. The RX300 raises the question of what
is a SUV? This new entry to the market certainly doesn't look like
a sport utility, it rides more like a car (it is built on a Camry
frame), and it lacks a low-range gear for true off-road driving.
But it has all the other SUV attributes _ high seating, all-wheel
drive, and roomy interior. It also gets better mileage than most
SUVs _ around 19 miles to the gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Lexus also offers the LX470 ($58,500), a full-size, full-time
4wd with V-8 power that is new this year, replacing the LX450. The
vehicle is similar to the Toyota Land Cruiser. The new vehicles are
aimed at becoming the ``King of 4WD,'' according to Toyota. The
vehicles have a new 32-valve, 4.7-liter V-8 that offers a 7 percent
fuel gain, a new Automatic Height Control system allowing the
driver to raise the body by up to 2 inches at the push of a button,
a new heating system, better stability, and a spacious interior.
</P>
<P>
   Winning accolades since its '98 introduction is the
Mercedes-Benz M-Class sport utility. The ML320 ($34,950) has been
cited for its ride, safety, ruggedness, performance, fuel economy,
usability and price _ it's in the same range as a top-of-the-line
Ford Explorer or Jeep Grand Cherokee. Consumer Reports puts it at
the top of its SUV list. The only problem with the V-6 powered
ML320 is availability _ it's a long wait for the Alabama-produced
vehicle. This year, Mercedes adds a second model, the ML430 with
V-8 power. Some of the nice touches of the M-Class include bumpers
set at the same level as a car (unlike other SUVs, the Mercedes
bumper won't end up in a car's body, causing additional damage
during a collision), BabySmart automatic child seat recognition (a
system that deactivates the front passenger-side airbag if a child
is in a booster seat in front), and a new Power Skyview Top option
that offers a huge roof opening (about four-feet by three-feet
wide).
</P>
<P>
   Ford is still king of the hill when it comes to sales of its
Explorer and near twin, Mercury Mountaineer. For '99 the Explorer
adds a Reverse Sensing System (a whole-range rear warning system to
alert drivers of objects when backing up), side airbags, Homelink
(a remote control for opening garage doors, lights, etc),
Travelnote, an electronic message organizer that records and plays
messages. On an environmental note, both the Explorer and
Expedition (Mountaineer and Navigator, as well) are now
low-emission vehicles, producing 40 percent less smog-forming
emissions than before.
</P>
<P>
   The Expedition, Ford's huge SUV, adds an optional
power-adjustable brake and accelerator pedals that can be adjusted
up to 3 inches, a plus for shorter drivers. These features can also
be found in the Lincoln Navigator and the Mercury Mountaineer.
</P>
<P>
   In the lower price range, Suzuki is out to set a new standard
for mini-sport-utility vehicles. The Grand Vitara ($21,429) will be
the first in its class to have a V-6 engine, and with its body
built onto a steel ladder frame like larger SUVs, this vehicle is a
true off-roader, complete with a four-wheel drive system. It
includes a two-speed transfer case with low range for climbing and
descending steep hills. The inside of the Grand Vitara is said to
almost equal that of the Jeep Cherokee.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Vitara is joined by two four-cylinder versions: the
Suzuki Vitara and the Chevrolet Tracker. These will be available as
two-door convertible or four-door hardtop. The V-6 will only be
available at Suzuki dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Kia, a Korean company, has slowly been making its way to the
East Coast and arrived in New England this fall. Along with it
comes the Kia Sportage, which is designed to appeal to Generation X
in style, and more importantly, in price. The Kia Sportage starts
at $14,445, a thousand or more dollars less than competitors such
as the Isuzu Amigo and Toyota RAV4. The Kia will be available as a
two-door convertible and four-door model.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Consumer Reports labeled the 1996 Isuzu Trooper II
and the 1988 Suzuki Samurai as being unacceptable for, in Consumer
Union's eye, a tendency to roll over in emergency tests, consumers
have become aware that this could be a problem in any SUV. SUVs sit
high above the road and, therefore, tend to lean more in turns than
lower profile automobiles. The new Land Rover Discovery Series II
offers a computer-assisted system that should allay this unsettling
feeling. The Discovery features ACE _ active cornering enhancement
_ which uses hydraulic levers that counter the lateral tilt of the
vehicle's body. This is the only vehicle sold in America that
offers such a system.
</P>
<P>
   The Land Rover Discovery II ($35,000) is the second generation
of this model. The new model is slightly lower and six inches
longer than last year's. The added space goes for cargo and
rear-seat passengers. The new model also comes with another first _
an electronic hill descent control that supplements engine braking
on steep hills by automatically applying the brakes as needed. The
Discovery is also four inches wider than the '98, and has a V-8
engine that has added power and torque.
</P>
<P>
   Other SUVs already on the market include the Acura SLX
($38,300), Chevrolet Blazer ($21,600), the monstrous Chevrolet/GMC
Suburban ($25,500), Dodge Durango ($27,000), available with an
optional 5.9-liter V-8, the biggest engine in its class; GMC Jimmy
($21,800), Honda CR-V ($18,300), Honda Passport ($$23,800),
Infiniti QX4 ($35,550), Isuzu Rodeo ($17,900), Isuzu Trooper
($27,800), Jeep Wrangler ($14,200), Land Rover Discovery ($34,500),
Land Rover Range Rover ($56,000), Mitsubishi Montero ($33,500),
Mitsubishi Montero Sport ($18,100), Nissan Pathfinder ($23,900),
Oldsmobile Bravada ($30,700), Subaru Forester ($18,700), Subaru
Outback ($24,500), Toyota 4Runner ($20,500), Toyota RAV4 ($15,400)
and Toyota Land Cruiser ($45,900)
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, what's a Quigley? Quigley is a company that has been
converting vans and trucks to four-wheel-drive. Now it is marketing
a four-wheel-drive based on a full-size van through Ford,
Chevrolet, and GMC dealers.

MUSCLE CARS RETURN IN CIVILIZED STYLE

 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R. WHITE  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time was when the auto industry sold cars on the basis of raw
power, cars with big engines sporting mucho cubes, lots of horses _
lingo for large displacement and high horsepower. It seems like
only yesterday ... well, actually it was only yesterday that you
probably heard an ad for a Ford F250 with a humungous V-10 or saw a
billboard touting somebody's new 300 horsepower performance sedan.
</P>
<P>
   Power is back. In spades. But today's muscle is a bit more
civilized than that of two decades ago. Despite oil embargoes,
threats of embargoes, wars and rumors of wars, ecologically
protective legislation, and technological revolution, the heady
attraction of the automobile remains its perceived power _ muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, we were told that the days of the
high-horsepower, gas-guzzling behemoth was over; the econobox and
sensible fuel economy would become the norm. Well, they were partly
right; the 1999 offerings, powerful though they may be, are vastly
more fuel efficient than anything even remotely imagined in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   What has changed is the engine technology; the motors of merely
20 years ago seem ancient artifacts compared to the
100,000-miles-between-tuneups, fuel-injected, computer-managed,
sensor-guided fuel-sippers of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   And style has changed; 20 years ago American families looked to
the V-8-powered, rear-drive station wagon as basic family
transport, vehicles with room for six and fuel appetites offering
14 to 17 miles per gallon. Today, the station wagon, where it still
exists, is a front-drive, four or five-passenger vehicle with a V-6
or smaller engine and fuel economy averaging 25 miles per gallon,
perhaps higher.
</P>
<P>
   The family workhorses today are vehicles virtually unknown 20
years ago _ the front-drive minivan _ six or seven passengers, lots
of room and maybe 25 to 30-something miles per gallon _ or the
sport utility, a label that encompasses a vast range of vehicles
accommodating four to six (sometimes more) people and consuming 12
to 14 m.p.g. in the case of the largest to maybe 25 m.p.g. for the
smallest. SUVs embrace all classes, from high-price Lexus, Lincoln,
and Cadilllac to humbler Toyota, Honda, and Jeep mini models _ not
to mention a V-8 all-wheel-drive van-look-alike Mercedes SUV.
</P>
<P>
   The SUV, in the main, is a truck-based passenger vehicle sitting
higher off the road than sedans, frequently with all-wheel or
four-wheel drive, usually designed more with off-road use in mind
rather than highway operation, and distinguished more for the
ability to evade federal regulation than the ability to evade
disaster in the hands of inexperienced or overly exuberant drivers.
The SUV is a product born of evasion; based on a truck chassis, it
is exempt from the federal fuel economy strictures and tailpipe
rules that led to the demise of the conventional station wagon _
the trucks come under somewhat more lenient rules that allow for
the power to do what wagons once did: carry things, pull trailers.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere between the late '70s rush to economy and now,
American families discovered that the econobox couldn't hack it in
a car pool, truck the trash to the dump, carry lumber and paint, or
even allow travel in comfort for many people. The many-strictured
sedan/coupe became too small to serve the tall, the wide, the
family. While the family boat could double as commuter vehicle,
albeit a thirsty one, a little commuter car couldn't carry the
family load.
</P>
<P>
   With the technology of today, however, the commuter vehicles
have gained in room and comfort while the bigger family vehicles
have gained substantially in fuel economy _ a sensible commuting
vehicle need no longer be a microcar. The compromise between
comfort and economy has been realized, but something else changed:
Fuel is cheap and plentiful again.
</P>
<P>
   The economy has prospered, more people are working, the price of
fuel has declined in real terms, and increased in abundance. In the
face of that abundance, America has again embraced excess _ trucks,
SUVs et al. now account for about half the automobile market.
</P>
<P>
   Something else is changing. Radically. New competition is
altering the face _ and the names _ of the industry. Chrysler, the
company that has come back from the dead too many times to count
and given us of late the bruiser Ram truck with V-10, a sports car
named Viper with a V-10, and a street rod called Prowler, has
joined its Pentastar with the Daimler-Benz Tristar _ you can call
the new company DaimlerChrysler, no hyphen, no space. On paper, it
is a perfect match of Benz high-end products with Chrysler
mass-marketed vehicles. Culturally, it is the Prussian Cavalry
meets the American Rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   Kia, a Korean auto company of some size, is about to emerge from
bankruptcy as an arm of Hyundai, another Korean maker.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has already acquired _ saved _ Jaguar, BMW owns Range
Rover, and that most venerable of British makers, Rolls-Royce, has
been torn asunder in a battle betwen BMW and Volkswagen. VW outbid
BMW with a last minute offer ``slid under the door,'' but the
purchase didn't include the trademarked name Rolls-Royce. BMW got
that from erstwhile parent Vickers _ BMW owns Rolls-Royce; VW owns
the factory and the rights to Bentley. Meanwhile, VW has looked
back to the future with a very modern Beetle.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors continues to shrink, is reorganizing yet again as
the ``leaner, meaner'' GM. Toyota and Ford have cash to weather
storms _ any chance of a merger here? Perhaps bits and pieces of a
troubled GM? No one comments, although one executive at Ford did
say: ``We look forward to making briliant acquisitions of badly
managed companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford has tightened its grip on stumbling partner, Mazda. Nissan
remains unprofitable despite good cars.
</P>
<P>
   Honda, which is almost an American company, even exporting
American-assembled cars to Japan, now threatens American supremacy
in the minivan business with the new Odyssey, a 210-horsepower
front-drive van with innovative and very versatile seating, two
sliding doors _ and 17 cupholders.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese invented the mini pickup. But, even as the
Americans perfected it and took back that market, Japanese
companies had been reluctant to move into heavy pickups. That's
changed. Say hello to the Toyota Tundra, that company's first
full-size, V-8-powered pickup and a challenge to the Ford F150,
Dodge Ram, and GM full-size models. The 245-horsepower Toyota,
available with four doors, is to be built in Indiana, not Japan.
</P>
<P>
   More hosepower, more doors, more cupholders _ these are the
modern challenges. Ford, Chrysler, and GM all offer four-door
pickups and vans with sliding doors on both sides. When the
distinctions blur, you can always count the cupholders.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler's slogan best sums up the auto business in 1999:
``Everything's changed. Again.''

   The midsize, Firebird ($17,700) is available as a two-door
hatchback and convertible ($28,900). The sports car now offers
electronic traction control on both the V-6 and V-8 models and adds
an eight-speaker sound system as standard equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The full-size Bonneville ($22,500) offers new color choices for
'99. It is set to be completely redone in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Prix ($18,700) is available as both coupe and sedan.
For '99, this midsize model ups the power to 200 horses, and offers
the OnStar mobile communications system.
</P>
<P>
   The subcompact Sunfire ($12,600) offers three body choices _
two-door coupe, convertible and four-door sedan. Only minor changes
are offered in '99.
</P>
<P>
   Pontiac also offers the midsize minivan Montana ($21,1000).
</P>
<P>
   In addition, General Motors has paired many Pontiac dealerships
with GMC trucks.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; PORSCHE
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After 34 years, Porsche has a new 911 ($65,000), which offers a
flat (but not air-cooled), 296-horsepower engine and a six-speed
manual transmission for quick, responsive handling. It is offered
with rear- or all-wheel drive, and as a coupe or convertible.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly one of the most popular subcompact sports cars is the
Boxter ($41,000). This ``affordable'' Porsche has great looks,
along with the power of a six-cylinder, 201-horsepower engine.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; ROLLS-ROYCE

   The first new Rolls-Royce in nearly two decades has arrived. The
Silver Seraph ($216,400) comes with a V-12 engine, five-speed
adaptive transmission, new suspension, braking and traction
assistance, and an engine built by BMW.
</P>
<P>
   The name, Silver Seraph _ seraph is defined by the Oxford
English Dictionary as ``celestial being of the highest order,
associated especially with light, ardor, and purity'' is in keeping
with this high-end offering.
</P>
<P>
   For the price, only the finest of materials are used. For
example, for the center console, 10 thin layers of Tulip wood are
formed for the finished veneer. And owners, with the help of
Rolls-Royce design team, can design interior touches to include
anything from a navigation system to a business center on wheels.

   Earlier this year Saab introduced its all new 9-5 ($30,000) to
replace its aging 9000 series. The 9-5 is a full-size sedan powered
by either a four-cylinder or V-6 engine. A wagon version will be
out this spring. The car is loaded with innovative features such as
ventilated front seats and the Saab Active Head Restraint system
for improved protection from whiplash. There is even an
air-conditioned glove box in this nicely equipped and performing
car.
</P>
<P>
   The 9-3 ($25,500) which was redone last year, gets turbo power
for '99. This midsize model comes as a two- or four-door hatchback
and a two-door convertible.

   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other than efforts to make the Saturn ($10,600) a quieter
running vehicle, there are few changes in its lineup of coupe,
sedan and station wagon. These compact five-passenger cars are
known best for their no hassle sales, dealer service, and
affordable prices.
</P>
<P>
   Saturn has found the one complaint they get from customers is
engine noise, and this year engineers have made a number of changes
to reduced the engine's decibel level. A larger model, said to be
called the Innovate, will be offered in the future.

   Subaru has made its mark in all-wheel-drive vehicles. Since
opting to sell only AWD models in 1993, Subaru has seen its sales
almost triple to more than 130,000 in 1997. Unlike other
manufacturers who tend to market vehicles to people based on age or
income, Subaru bases its sales on interest. It targets health care
and education workers who need to go in any kind of weather, as
well as those with outdoor interests.
</P>
<P>
   The Impreza ($16,400) is available as a sedan, coupe and station
wagon. A more sport-utility version of this is the Forester
($18,700).
</P>
<P>
   The midsize Legacy ($19,000) marks its 30th anniversary in the
United States with special editions in both its sedan and wagon
lineup. The Outback ($22,500) version of the Legacy wagon offers a
raised roof and is higher off the ground for use as an alternative
to larger sport-utility vehicles. New is an Outback Limited with
leather upholstery and heated seats.

<P>
   Toyota has only one new model for 1999, but that's not bad for a
company that had the No. 1 best-selling car in America last year _
the Camry. The company continues to expand in this country,
building a new plant in Indiana for its upcoming full-size truck
and possibly a sports utility.
</P>
<P>
   New for '99 is the Camry Solara ($18,600), a two-door coupe with
distinctive looks. Toyota says the Solara is aimed at ``consumers
entering their peak earning years, who are nostalgic for the sports
cars of their youth, but need more room and comfort than a sports
car can provide.'' It comes with either a four-cylinder or V-6
engine and five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission.
Fifteen-inch wheels are standard and a sports package is available
on the V-6, which includes 16-inch wheels. Solara is the first
Toyota to have a new JBL premium sound system with 200 watts and
eight speakers ``that will achieve a level of performance and sound
reproduction previously unavailable in a Toyota.''
</P>
<P>
   The Camry ($17,000), on which the Solara is based, adds more
safety features and enhanced convenience options. Front-seat
side-impact airbags are available as an option on Camry this year.
The Camry sedan is available with either a four-cylinder or V-6
engine. All models come with a four-speed automatic. New this year
is an optional five-speed manual transmission paired with the V-6
engine on the LE model.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota describes its Avalon ($24,500) as its best equipped and
most spacious vehicle. The car is available in either five- or
six-seat configurations. After four successful years as Toyota's
flagship, the '99 comes with only minor exterior and interior
changes. The car is powered by a V-6 engine.
</P>
<P>
   The compact Corolla ($11,900), which was totally redesigned last
year, enters the new model year almost unchanged. The car comes
with a four-cylinder engine matched to a five-speed manual
transmission that can offer EPA mileage estimates of 31 city, 38
highway. Three-speed and four-speed automatic transmissions as well
as side airbags are options.
</P>
<P>
   The sporty Celica ($17,200) comes with few changes and one less
model _ the GT Coupe. These fun-to-drive vehicles are powered by a
four-cylinder engine matched to a five-speed manual transmission.
The car is available as a GT Liftback and a GT Convertible. A
four-speed automatic transmission is optional.
</P>
<P>
   Dropped from Toyota's lineup is the Tercel.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; VOLKSWAGEN
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Beetle isn't the only thing new or coming from Volkswagen.
The German manufacturer is launching completely redesigned or new
models throughout its line in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   The Beetle ($15,200), which has been getting lots of attention
since its introduction earlier this year, is also getting more
features, which should make it even more popular. An optional
20-valve turbo-charged engine tops the list. Other items include an
optional power sunroof, door entry lights, rear reading lights, and
an eyeglass holder. And, of course, the flower-holding vase
returns.
</P>
<P>
   The Passat ($20,800), which was redesigned last year, is now
also offered as a wagon with a choice of four-cylinder or V-6
power. The Passet GLX wagon will offer Volkswagen's Syncro
all-wheel drive along with a five-speed automatic transmission with
Tiptronic, which allows the car to be driven manually or
automatically.
</P>
<P>
   The Golf ($13,500) will arrive soon in the US market with a
larger and more ridgid body. Engine choices include a 2.0-liter
four-cylinder engine and an optional turbo-charged direct-injection
diesel. The car will come with lots of standard features from
antilock brakes to an instrument panel with blue back-lit
illumination. Side airbags are included.
</P>
<P>
   The GTI (about $16,700), a three-door hatchback, will arrive
early next year, and will feature a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine
or a hot performing V-6 with 172 horsepower, known as the VR6.
</P>
<P>
   The Jetta ($14,600), due this month, comes with a new look as
well as added features. The car offers a standard 2.0-liter,
four-cylinder engine and an optional VR6.
</P>
<P>
   After a short absence, VW is bringing back its EuroVan
($29,900), with V-6 power. The van can be ordered with a Weekender
Package that includes a pop-up roof with two-person bed. An
extended wheelbase version for added room is also available.

</P>
<P>
   Volvo enters the 1999 model year with new models and a switch to
front-wheel drive on all vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The all-new front-drive S80 ($35,800) midsize sedan replaces the
former rear-drive S90. The S80 is not only Volvo's largest sedan,
but also its most luxurious. The car can also be a powerhouse. It
is available with two engines _ an inline 6 cylinder with 201
horsepower or a 2.8-turbocharged plant with 265 horsepower. The S80
is also loaded with safety improvements, including an inflatable
curtain for extra head protection in addition to front and side
airbags and a new whiplash protection system designed to cut
injuries from rear-end collisions.
</P>
<P>
   The S70 ($27,900) sedan, which was redesigned for the '98 model
year, has few changes for '99. It is available in both sedan and
station wagon models. An all-wheel drive sedan joins the
all-wheel-drive station wagon series. The models come with a
five-cylinder engine with horsepower ranging from 190 to a
turbocharged 236.
</P>
<P>
   With its C70 ($39,000) coupe or convertible, Volvo is showing
the company can be a stylish as well safety-minded company. The
5-cylinder engine can be mated to either a five-speed manual or
four-speed automatic transmission.

EVERYBODY LOVES A PICKUP TRUCK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's nothing like having a pickup truck. With pickups
becoming more carlike, and roomier, they fit nicely into many a
buyer's lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   My neighbor said he finally saw the light, and replaced his
compact car with a compact Chevrolet pickup. Between remodeling the
house, and trips to the dump he decided the pickup would better
suit his needs and his daily commute to work. Since there already
was a larger family car, the small backseat in his former car got
little use and the pickup bed was far more practical.
</P>
<P>
   For 1999, Chevrolet and GMC have a new line of trucks that
definitely are more carlike in many features, more powerful, and
offer added conveniences.
</P>
<P>
   The Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra lines are full-size
pickups that come in standard and extended cabs with a choice of
three engines. A standard third door is offered on all extended
cabs. The trucks come with a wider track, in front and back, to
stabilize loads.
</P>
<P>
   Both trucks feature rack and pinion steering, a first for a
full-size truck. The system, similar to that in most cars, gives a
more precise feel to the steering. Engineers have avoided using
this system in trucks because they believed the system was not
durable under heavy use. GM says its system can take the
punishment, but will offer it only on half-ton, two-wheel drive
models. Also featured is AutoTrac, an automatic four-wheel-drive
system. The system can also be activated at the touch of a dash
button.
</P>
<P>
   Both vehicles offer four-wheel disk brakes, with larger pads and
rotors. Also featured is a new generation of Vortec V-8 engine _
one, a 6.0-liter, develops 300 horsepower, challenging Dodge, which
until now had the largest engine in its truck class.
</P>
<P>
   Chevy also has the S10 pickup with an Extreme package that
lowers the vehicle two inches and features full ground effects and
wheel flares. It also has a sport suspension and enhanced
transmission.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing GM didn't put on these new models is a fourth
door, which is the rage of the truck world. GM says a fourth door
will be on the 2000 models.
</P>
<P>
   The pickup, an American institution, may be getting some hot
competition in the near future. Toyota will start selling its first
full-sized pickup, the Tundra, next spring. This American-built
truck will feature a 245-horsepower V-8, with more power than a
standard Ford F-150. For now, Toyota just offers its compact
Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, however, is boosting power options for 1999. Its
top-selling F-Series pickups now come with an optional 235- to
265-horsepower V-8, and added a smooth 275-horsepower V-10 to its
heavy duty line.
</P>
<P>
   Ford offers four doors as standard equipment on all its SuperCab
F-Series models, and a four-door SuperCab is an option on its
Ranger series. The F-Series also offer a nice snap-free,
factory-installed tonneau cover for the truck bed.
</P>
<P>
   Dodge gives its larger than compact Dakota models larger wheels
for 1999 along with added trim features including optional radio
controls on the steering wheel. Four engine choices are offered.
Standard or club cab versions are offered.
</P>
<P>
   The full-size Dodge Ram comes as a two-door standard-cab or a
four-door club-cab version. More convenience options are also on
tap for this year.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan has a new compact pickup, the Frontier, with a very
refined V-6 from the Quest minivan. With the automatic, the
Frontier has a towing capacity of 5,000 pounds. It is also offered
in a four-wheel-drive King Cab model.
</P>
<P>
   Mazda now has a four-door option on its B-series small pickups.
Another option is a V-6 engine.
</P>
<P>
   The quest for more doors isn't ending. Nissan reportedly will
show a concept pickup with five doors at the Detroit auto show in
January. The fifth door will be a hinged rear liftgate at the back
of the cabin. When opened, the fifth door extends the pickup bed
into the cab for longer loads.

<P>
   What's an Alero? A Daewoo? An Escalade? Is that BMW a car from
the past, or present? The 300? Haven't we heard that name before?
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the new car model year is upon us, loaded with new names,
new companies, and adding more confusion for those trying to decide
what to buy or not to buy.
</P>
<P>
   So what's hot this year?
</P>
<P>
   Safety is very in. So are coupes. Horsepower is up. Prices,
though, are stable. Most manufacturers are holding the line on
prices, and some, like Ford, have dropped prices on some models by
up to $2,000. Mercedes-Benz has boosted prices by less than 2
percent, but when additional equipment on the new models is figured
in, the 1999 model prices are lower than similar 1998s.
</P>
<P>
   It's going to be an interesting model year for both consumers
and manufacturers. Consumers have the ``problem'' of more choices
at more price points. For manufacturers, the year is a gamble: How
will the new models play in such a fickle market, and will the
economy slow sales?
</P>
<P>
   The choices for 1999 keep growing. And, with each new model the
manufacturers predict their sales will jump by anywhere from a few
thousand to a hundred thousand. With all these predictions of sales
increases, someone has to lose.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't stopped Daewoo, a Korean manufacturer, from entering
the American market. Daewoo started as a textile company, and
didn't start building cars under its own name until 1992. After
success in Europe and South America, Daewoo is here with an
unconventional game plan: Hire college students to market cars that
are underpriced, offer no-hassle sales, and a three-year
free-maintenance program.
</P>
<P>
   With models at the low ($9,000-$12,000), medium
($12,000-$14,000), and higher price ($15,000-$20,000) price ranges,
the Daewoos are quite nice. But unless you know a college student
in the Boston area, or head out to Natick, you may not easily
locate one of these models. Daewoo is marketing the cars in a
limited number of cities across the country, primarily in major
university areas; there are also company dealerships in Rhode
Island and Connecticut. Still Daewoo faces the same obstacle as
other companies: There are a lot of good vehicles out there, and a
lot of hot models for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Oldsmobile, once a major player in the auto world, has high
hopes for its low-priced entry model, the Alero. Volkswagen is on a
roll. Since reintroducing its cute little Beetle in January, the
company is coming out with more new models, from the Golf to a new
Passat. Saab just introduced the 9-5, replacing its aging 9000
series. At the New England International Automobile Show, the
company will show off a wagon version of the 9-5 that will be sold
beginning next spring. Chrysler has reached into its past to bring
out the 300M, a stylish and hot performing sedan. Infiniti is
looking to lure more buyers its way with the new entry-level luxury
G20 sedan. Volvo has an all-new S80 sedan that has style and
performance, and is packed with safety features.
</P>
<P>
   The sport-utility market gets bigger with each passing day. For
the first time in its 96-year history, Cadillac has a sport utility
vehicle of its own, the Escalade. Every manufacturer sees a SUV in
its future, it seems.
</P>
<P>
   For Cadillac, it's the numbers game. The luxury car maker was
losing sales to Lincoln ever since that company came out with its
SUV, the Navigator. Lexus now has almost 40 percent of its sales in
its SUV, the RX 300. Mercedes-Benz can't keep up with the demand
for its highly rated ML320.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of these monstrous gas gulping vehicles defies
convention. Designed (and advertised) as rugged all-terrain
transportation, they are rarely used off road, according to surveys
of owners.
</P>
<P>
   But they're hot.
</P>
<P>
   And if the Caddy or Lincoln versions are too big, Honda, Toyota,
Isuzu, and Kia have smaller, less costly models. Suzuki has a new
mini-SUV in the Grand Vitara that offers more power and space for
its class than any of its competitors. Jeep, the name most
associated with SUVs, isn't sitting by idly. Chrysler has an
all-new Jeep Grand Cherokee this year. The company has spent more
than $2 billion on this baby, including beefing up the
manufacturing process to produce even more to meet the demand.
</P>
<P>
   Because SUVs stand high off the ground, there are some safety
concerns on cornering. Land Rover has an optional device on its new
Discovery that reportedly cuts the sway feeling.
</P>
<P>
   In the minivan field, it's all doors and new competition for the
dominant Chrysler. Dual-passenger and driver's-side sliding doors
are in _ Windstar now has them, so too does the Mercury
Villager/Nissan Quest. And, if they're power driven, all the
better.
</P>
<P>
   The Honda Odyssey offers an all-new way to look at minivans,
from performance to use of space inside for seating and cargo. The
Odyssey is real competition for Chrysler and Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Doors are big news on trucks as well. GMC and Chevy have new
truck models to give Ford a run for the money. And, like Ford
models, these vehicles have added doors that open out for more
practical interior use of space.
</P>
<P>
   But 1999 is not all SUVs and minivans. It is the year of the
coupe. Toyota has the Solara, based on, but nothing like, the
Camry. BMW has an eye-catching M3 coupe; it has a long hood and
short body, but, oh, does it go. There's a coupe for every pocket,
in every style, from just about every manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the industry, there are new engines, more horsepower,
and added safety features. There's no question that air bags save
lives, the problem is that they could also injure or kill
motorists. Many manufacturers are now offering ``second
generation'' bags that inflate with less impact. Side airbags are
becoming more available. New this year are side curtain-like bags
for added protection. Saab has a new Active Head Restraint system
to protect front passengers from whiplash injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Small people with big vehicles have a friend in Ford. The
company is offering adjustable pedals for braking and acceleration.
The pedals can be adjusted up to 3 inches, making them easier to
reach.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to seating, there are some new ideas out there.
More companies are offering the option of having heated front (some
rear as well) seats, but Saab also has a ventilated front seat for
drivers. And, if that's not good enough, Cadillac has a seat that
massages.
</P>
<P>
   The auto world is changing in the way cars are designed and the
way they're sold. Using the Internet to buy cars is becoming more
popular, and companies are pushing dealerships to become more
customer friendly. Some of the big names _ Ford and General Motors
_ are looking to consolidate dealerships. Ford is experimenting
with not only consolidating all the dealerships in some cities, but
also owning them.

TODAY'S PAPERS: PAGE 1 DIGEST FOR NOV. 5. 
</HEADLINE>
  By SCOTT SHUGER 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Election postmortems lead all around. In the aftermath of the
first midterm election since 1934 in which the president's party
gained House seats, the headlines stress Republican disarray.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times top says the Republican party ``Takes
Stock of Losses.'' USA Today's header says a ``GOP Shake-Up is
Possible''--right next to a big picture of a befuddled-looking Newt
juxtaposed with the caption, ``Will Gingrich Survive?'' The New
York Times big type says, ``GOP in Scramble Over Blame,'' and the
Washington Post sums things up similarly: ``Shaken Republicans
Count Losses, Debate Blame.''
</P>
<P>
   (Question to the WP's photo editor: Was it really necessary at
this very satisfying moment for Bill Clinton, to run a picture of
him that suggests he's having cramps? Didn't he smile at least once
Tuesday?)
</P>
<P>
   According to the papers, the single biggest lesson learned from
Tuesday's vote is, in the words of the Wall Street Journal
front-page wash-up, ``Impeachment isn't a winning agenda.'' And the
problem, at least in the eyes of some of the more stalwart movement
conservatives quoted in the coverage, was that, on the GOP side,
there wasn't enough of any other agenda. The WP quotes Gary Bauer
of the Family Research Council complaining, ``We just ran one of
the least ideological campaigns we've run in years....'' and a
similar complaint from Randy Tate, executive director of the
Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   But the NYT points out the dilemma the Republicans face if they
respond by simply ideologically souping up, with this quote from a
conservative Florida congressman: ``We've got to reach out and have
more than Southern white males running the Washington Republican
Party.''
</P>
<P>
   The NYT and WP pass along a classic non-concession concession
from Newt Gingrich. The Times version: ``I mean, I totally
underestimated the degree to which people would just get sick of
24-hour-a-day talk television and talk radio and then the degree to
which this whole scandal became just sort of disgusting by sheer
repetition.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, explains the Post's Howard Kurtz, in a ``Style''
section piece, it was the media's fault. Kurtz goes on to resurrect
a Gingrich quote from earlier this year in which he said he would
never again as long as he was speaker make a speech without
commenting on the scandal. And then for good measure, he quotes
conservative muckety-muck Bill Kristol's assessment of Gingrich's
analysis: ``mind-boggling.'' It's that sort of chagrin that's
behind the rumblings of a House coup all the papers report.
</P>
<P>
   The papers also say that an immediate consequence of the vote is
at least a drastically scaled-down impeachment inquiry. They all
report that Henry Hyde is now leaning towards having his Judiciary
Committee call only one witness--Kenneth Starr. (The WP runs a
separate article about this as its off-lead.) The WSJ says look for
a quick negotiated resolution of the Lewinsky scandal between the
Hill and the White House. And the NYT flatly asserts that the
Republican majority is now so slim that ``there is little chance
the 218 votes required for impeachment can be assembled.''
</P>
<P>
   The other big political story of the day is the election in the
Minnesota governor's race of former pro wrestler Jesse ``The Body''
Ventura. The political upstart garners front-pagers at the LAT and
NYT and an inside piece at the WP. Ventura's out-of-the-blue
arrival on the scene is energizing the media in ways not seen since
the early days of Ross Perot's first candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   The LAT notes that Ventura, who will now become the highest
officeholder in Perot's Reform party, asked Perot for campaign
money, but was turned down. The WP reports that Ventura's ad
campaign was managed by William Hillsman, who did the ads for the
previous title-holder for Most Shocking Minnesota Campaign By A
Former Wrestler--Paul Wellstone's upset 1991 win of a U.S. Senate
seat. (A previous pre-election Post story on ex-Navy Seal Ventura
barely mentioned that there has been some controversy about his
military service. This would be a fine time to elaborate.)
</P>
<P>
   The NYT's Ventura effort is accompanied by a color picture of
the governor-elect trouncing a previous opponent--in 1985, by
stomping him into the ropes. The Times piece also includes the
sounds-pretty-right assessment of that astute political
commentator, Hulk Hogan: ``Jesse's victory proves that people want
a real man in power to lead, not a play plastic puppet like other
politicians.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a time when auto makers could not seem to sell safety
to customers. How the times have changed.
</P>
<P>
   Now some manufacturers are almost playing one-upmanship in the
safety world. Volvo has become a name synonymous with safe
vehicles, but other makers are saying, ``Hey, Volvo's not the only
company making safe vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   Saab, which has won Swedish awards for safety, has decided not
to take a back seat. It is letting people know it has built, and
continues to build, safe vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   At a presentation, Saab engineers showed how &UR;  &LR; the company builds
cars not for government-mandated crash tests but for ``real life''
situations, with crumple zones within the vehicle effective if the
car is hit on an angle, not just straight on as in federal tests.
</P>
<P>
   BMW and Mercedes-Benz are also getting out the message. Mercedes
has developed a number of safety features over the years that the
company freely allows others to copy. When it comes to a safe
vehicle, driving a Mercedes has been compared to driving a tank.
It's a solid vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is promoting its Windstar minivan as a safe vehicle. It
received the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's
five-star award in crash test ratings. The only other minivan to
receive the award is the '98 Toyota Sienna. Windstar offers such
added features as standard foam and cushioning in the ceiling and
window pillars to help reduce head injuries in a crash.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford minivan comes with two options for even safer driving:
side airbags designed for front-seat passengers to cushion both the
head and torso in a side crash, and a reverse-sensing system that
starts beeping when the bumper is 5.9 feet away from an obstacle
and sounds more frequently as the vehicle gets closer to the
object. The beeping is heard only inside the minivan.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all cars and most trucks now have dual front air bags as
standard equipment. More air bags, though, are on the way. Since
their introduction a couple of years ago, side airbags are
beginning to show up in more and more vehicles. The bags are
mounted either in the front door panels or on the side of the front
seats.
</P>
<P>
   With the controversy over injuries and, in some cases, deaths as
the result of airbag deployments, a number of vehicles now are
equipped with ``second generation'' bags. These units tend not to
explode with the force of earlier versions.
</P>
<P>
   Another recent change came about because of injuries and deaths
to children caused by air bags activating in the front seat. Many
trucks, which tend to have only one seat, are now equipped with
key-operated shut offs for the front passenger side air bag to
prevent such injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes-Benz is now offering its Baby-Smart seat system in all
models. When a baby seat that Mercedes offers is placed in the
front, a sensor deactivates the air bag on that side of the car.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Mercedes-Benz and Volvo added air bag ``curtains'' to
some models. The curtains cover just about the entire door. BMW
offers a tube-like airbag that extends across the top of the front
doors to help protect the heads of front-seat passengers.
</P>
<P>
   As of Sept. 1, manufacturers were required to add extra padding
around windows to protect against head injuries. The National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration said the new curtain-style
airbags are innovative technology that surpass the extra padding
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Side-impact airbags have already found their way into low-priced
cars such as the Toyota Corolla. Some luxury makers are also adding
these for rear seat passengers. For true safety, however, the use
of seat belts to hold driver and passengers in place is a key
element. Relying on the air bags alone won't do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   Seat belts have also been greatly improved both for comfort and
for holding one in place in the event of a sudden stop.
</P>
<P>
   Some makers are giving added protection to avoid whiplash
injuries. Volvo has a new whiplash Protection System allowing the
seat backrest and head restraint to shift backward during rear-end
collisions. The system, Volvo says, reduces the force resulting
from rear impact by 50 percent. Saab also offers a similar system.
</P>
<P>
   Many luxury vehicles are providing driver-systems that sense
steering and traction conditions and automatically adjust to
prevent spinouts. BMW is including one in its new 3-Series.
</P>
<P>
   Antilock brakes have been hailed as almost more important in
preventing accidents than airbags. The brakes are intended to
prevent cars from skidding on slippery surfaces during a sudden
stop and to aid in stopping faster.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with antilock brakes is many people don't know how
to use them. Unlike regular brakes, which many drivers learned to
pump in emergencies, antilock brakes do the pumping automatically.
Drivers pumping antilock brakes make them less effective.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes-Benz now has a system called Brake-Assist that uses a
computer to determine when the use of the brakes is an emergency.
When this situation occurs, the computer automatically adds extra
pressure to the brakes. Mercedes says stopping distances can be
reduced by up to 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Without proper and well-maintained tires on the vehicle, no
brake is going to stop the car or truck effectively. Having the
right tires for your make and model and having them properly
inflated are very important, in even the simplest of stops.
</P>
<P>
   Corvette was one of the first to offer a device that warns of
low air pressure. The feature can now be found on other General
Motors makes. The system is tied to the antilock brake system. When
a sensor detects a loss of air, it triggers a warning light on the
instrument panel indicating which tire is low.

<P>
   Stopping by the side of the road to repair a flat tire can be
one of the most dangerous things a motorist can do There are too
many reports of motorists changing tires being struck by a passing
vehicle. Some '99s are coming with tires that are capable of
running for a while with a complete loss of air _ long enough to
find help or a safe place off the highway to change the tire.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a better grip on the road is what all-wheel-drive is
about. With AWD _ not four-wheel-drive _ power is shifted to the
wheel or wheels needing it most. Even if traction is lost on three
wheels, new systems from Jeep and Mercedes will shift the power to
the one wheel with traction, keeping the vehicle from skidding on
ice or snow.
</P>
<P>
   AWD, once a feature associated with sport-utility vehicles, is
now available in sedans and wagons from Subaru, Volvo, and
Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   Another new safety feature expected to be adapted by many
manufacturers is blue-tint headlights designed to give drivers
better road sight at night. High-intensity discharge, or HID,
headlights illuminate by creating an electric arc between two
electrodes in a bulb filled with xenon gas. These new lights have
been designed to help older drivers see better.

<P>
   &UR; 1. Do your homework:  &LR;  If you don't know what is available in
the automobile marketplace, you can't make a smart decision. A good
place to start is reading auto sections like this or picking up a
copy of one of the new car magazines. Attending the New England
International Automobile Show (see story on Page K2) also makes
good sense. Here you can check out just about every make and model
available. Sit in the vehicles, read the sticker prices, and pick
up brochures, all without a hassle. You can also talk to
knowledgeable people about the models, again without giving your
name.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2. Set a budget:  &LR;  There are lots of beautiful cars, sport
utilities, minivans, and pickups in every price range. There's no
sense in going beyond your means for wheels. You can get almost all
the convenience features of the most expensive models in
lower-priced vehicles. Once you set a budget, figure out the
features you want _ and really need _ then see what models fit
within your budget. Don't forget to include maintenance and fuel in
your budget plans. Ask how much tuneups costs and how often they
are required. Remember sport utility vehicles are in most cases gas
hogs that could eat a hole in your pocket.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 3. Sit in the models:  &LR;  Sitting in a vehicle is a key to your
future enjoyment of the vehicle. If the vehicle is too high to get
into on the showroom floor, it will be worse when you have to do it
daily. If the seats don't feel comfortable, you won't be
comfortable on the road. How's the visibility. If you can't see all
around, you could be asking for trouble on the highway. Are the
controls easy to reach, logical, well lit for nighttime? Are there
convenient places to put the things you carry? If you are planning
on having passengers, is there room in the rear seat when your seat
is at your maximum comfort level?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 4. Drive them:  &LR;  Once you've narrowed your choices down, take
some test drives. Be sure the vehicle you test has the equipment
and engine you are planning on buying. Even so-called clones of
vehicles can ride and handle quite differently. General Motors
midsize models like the Oldsmobile Intrigue may share engines and
other mechanics with fellow GM lines, but they can drive and handle
quite differently. On the test drive, try roads like the ones you
drive on most frequently to get a sense of feel and speed. Do you
need fast acceleration to get on a highway? Never, never, never buy
any vehicle without a good test drive. Around the block doesn't
make it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 5. Compare:  &LR;  Many American makes are dubbing their models as
import fighters, claiming similar handling, performance and feel,
all at a lower price. It pays to check out features and price, then
take a test drive. You may find you can save a few thousand dollars
by going American. Even if you buy American, it pays to compare
makes from the same manufacturer. Buick has been billed as the best
built car in America, yet it shares parts with Oldsmobile, Pontiac,
and Chevrolet. Does this mean that the Buick, which comes off the
same assembly line as some of these others, gets special attention?
No. So compare it, and its features (GM gives its makes some
exclusive features, so if you want these you'll have to buy that
make), and you may find happiness and a lower price in a similar GM
model. On the Internet, there are services such as Autosite.com
that offer side-by-side comparisons of models.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 6. Get pricing:  &LR;  If you don't know the total cost of the
vehicle, including dealer cost, how can you make a wise buying
decision? There are many sources of this information. Consumer
Reports, AAA, and autosite.com provide low-cost printouts of any
model you may be considering. The beauty of these services is that
they also can let you know about any incentives or special deals on
a particular make or model. Even some 1999 models have
customer-buying incentives.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 7. Compare:  &LR;  Do this especially if you are torn between say a
car and a SUV. Yes, SUVs are ``in'' but do you really need one? I
keep itching to buy one, but at the last minute, I get practical. I
want one for winter driving; I want to go in any kind of weather.
But then, I look at my trusty front-drive car and realize I've
gotten through all these winters without one of those big brutes.
My front-drive car has pulled me through some tough winter
conditions. So, I reason, I really don't need a SUV with its high
fuel consumption. There are more cars and wagons with
all-wheel-drive that are as good if not better than some SUVs. If
front-drive won't do, check out a car with AWD.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 8. Buy or lease:  &LR;  Leasing a vehicle is tempting because of the
lower cost. Yes, the monthly payments are a lot lower, but there's
the cost of mileage. Leases are generally keyed to driving no more
than 12,000 or so miles a year. Go over that and you pay a penalty
of 15 cents or more per mile. You may be better off buying. Sure,
you may have to set your sights on a lower priced model, but it
will be yours (and the bank's) and you won't have to worry about
mileage or nicks and scratches when it is time to turn it in.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 9. Dealership or Internet:  &LR;  Many people have found buying on
the Internet can save thousands, but do you really want to buy a
vehicle from a distant and unknown dealership? If you've done your
homework and priced out the vehicle of your dreams, you could do
just as well near home.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 10. Avoid costly extras:  &LR;  When it comes to signing on the
dotted line, beware the extras the business manager will suggest or
put on the bill of sale. An extended warranty may be good if you're
putting lots of miles on the car, but otherwise its not necessary.
Beware also of extra service charges, ask what they are for. If
they seem out of line, go elsewhere.

 c.1997 The Boston Globe

<P>
   BOSTON _ I was stuck in traffic on Route 3 heading for the Cape,
not an unusual summer happening. This time, though, I had just
gotten into an Acura 3.5RL with a dash-mounted navigation system.
</P>
<P>
   Having time on my hands, I decided to program the system to
Bridge Street in Orleans where I was heading (I later learned I
could have programmed it to get me out of the mess on an
alternative route). The system worked fine, not only showing me my
location on a small TV-like screen but also how far I was from my
destination.
</P>
<P>
   As I was moving along Route 6, suddenly a woman's voice came out
of nowhere to inform me I was just a half mile from the Orleans
rotary. Then, as I entered the rotary, she told me to take the
third left, then a right, then a quick left, then another onto
Bridge Street.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was late and I had promised my wife dinner, we took the
advice of our hosts at the Whaleback Inn to try the Binnacle
Tavern. Once again, the navigation system guided me easily to the
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   On Cape Cod, the only flaws were that many roads are not mapped
on the program, nor are street numbers. In major cities, like
Boston, the system is programmed for all streets and can find your
destination by street number as well.
</P>
<P>
   Heading back to the Globe, the system worked even better. It
requested a street number and guided me to the door. It also has
some unnerving features. As I approached the Globe on the Southeast
Expressway, I thought about getting off at Exit 14 instead of Exit
15. As I approached Exit 14 my thoughts were completely erased as
that woman suddenly came on telling me to stay on the Expressway
and get off at 15. Does it read minds?
</P>
<P>
   What thoroughly impressed me was its performance when I was
heading to the western Massachusetts town where I live. First, it
wanted to take me from the Globe onto the Southeast Expressway and
then the Massachusetts Turnpike. I decided to go the way I always
do, through South Boston. Unlike a previous system I tried, this
one required no manual fiddling to readjust my routing. It quickly
adapted to my route. Again, I threw it off by exiting in Cambridge;
it wanted to send me west on the turnpike. Within the next mile or
two it readjusted on its own a couple of times; first to get me
back on the turnpike, then, finally, it accepted my Route 2
headings and got me to within a mile of home accurately.
</P>
<P>
   Navigation systems have come a long way since first being
introduced. Some, like those on Mercedes-Benz vehicles, come with
not only lots of memory for cities across the country, but with
free updates as more information is available _ such as finding
more streets on the Cape or street numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem with built-in navigation systems is the cost of
the option. Most go for at least $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   With the cost of laptop computers down to well under $1,500 for
a fairly well-equipped model, my solution would be to buy a laptop
and add a program such as DeLorme's Street Atlas USA. With the
atlas loaded into a laptop, combined with the optional DeLorme GPS
receiver, you'll never get lost. The street atlas will route you,
find streets and addresses, provide exit information, and can even
be linked to go online to find restaurants and hotels. And the 6.0
new version adds 600,000 new or improved streets. Street Finder
retails for $45 and, with the GPS receiver, $159. Which means that
for under $1,500 you could have not only a portable navigation
system but also a computer that can handle lots of other details.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative, found now on almost all General Motors products,
is On-Star. A 24-hour system that combines on-board electronics,
global positioning system technology and a hands-free cellular
telephone to link the driver and vehicle with the OnStar center
where advisers can provide person-to-person help, from directions
to making hotel or restaurant reservations.
</P>
<P>
   The system also automatically notifies the center in case of any
front air bag deployment so that the adviser can send emergency
services to wherever you are. Other services range from theft
detection notification and stolen vehicle tracking to road service.

   The midsize Chrysler Sebring ($21,150) is available as a two- or
four-door coupe and is sold only in a one-price LXI model. While
the Chrysler Sebring convertible ($20,500) bears the same name as
the coupe, it is not a coupe with the top cut off. Rather it is
designed as a convertible and does not share the same platform with
the coupe.
</P>

   Chrysler also offers the luxurious Town &AMP; Country minivan
($33,500).

   Daewoo has been selling cars throughout the world, but this
year, the company enters the American market under its own name for
the first time. (It once produced a small Pontiac for General
Motors).
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo offers some unconventional ideas in the selling and
marketing of its vehicles. College students have been recruited to
market the cars, and, at its sole Massachusetts outlet in Natick,
the company promises ``no hassle'' sales. The cars are priced below
their competition, and come with three-year free maintenance. About
the only cost of ownership for that period is gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   The three models being offered are the Lanos ($9,000-$12,000),
about the size of a Honda Civic; the Nubira ($12,000-$14,000),
about the size of a Ford Contour; and the Leganza
($15,000-$20,000), in the Toyota Camry size range.
</P>
<P>
   The Leganza, the company's flagship, comes only as a sedan, and,
like the other models, it is well-equipped for the price. The Lanos
is offered as a three-door hatchback and four-door sedan; and the
Nubira comes in three versions _ a sedan, five-door hatchback, and
wagon. In test rides, the models all proved quite competent in
handling, performance, and comfort.

<P>
   The Dodge Intrepid ($19,700), which offers seating for five or
six, emphasizes sports performance. The car is offered with a
choice of 200- or 225-horsepower V-6 engines and offers the
AutoStick transmission. Redesigned for the '98 model year, there
are few changes in '99.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodge Avenger ($15,300) is a sports coupe that comes with
either a four- or six-cylinder engine. Buyers can also chose
between a five-speed manual or a four-speed automatic transmission.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodge Stratus ($14,800) is a four-door sedan with good
interior room. The Stratus is available with either a four- or
V-6-cylinder engine. Unlike its near twin, the Chrysler Cirrus,
Stratus offers the AutoStick transmission.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodge/Plymouth Neon ($11,300) received upgrades last year,
and remains basically unchanged for '99. It will undergo a major
redesign in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   The compact Neon ``provides buyers with a great balance of
style, fun and value,'' says Joe Caddell, Neon product manager.
``The new Neon R/T model received rave reviews, which gained
attention for the rest of the line, including the higher level of
standard equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodge also offers the Caravan ($17,500) minivan, and a complete
line of trucks as well as the rugged Durango sport-utility.

   The title for having the last full-size, rear-drive vehicles in
America goes to Ford for its Crown Victoria ($21,135). The model,
which had a complete makeover last year, has a few modifications in
looks and power for this year.
</P>
<P>
   Horsepower has been increased from 200 to 215, 16-inch wheels
are now standard, and a performance/ &QC; 
handling package is available. These vehicles are popular with
police departments, and can be ordered with a Police Interceptor
package with larger anti-sway bars and suspension upgrade. In
addition to its spacious interior, with its solid body on frame,
the Crown Victoria can easily handle six passengers and all their
luggage as well as tow a boat or trailer.
</P>
<P>
   For '99, the Contour ($13,460) adds better handling along with
added room for rear-seat passengers. Contour now shares the same
suspension design as its European cousin, Mondeo. The brakes have
also been improved to provide better stability on different road
surfaces. The Contour is also available in a high-performance
version, the SVT, and as a bi-fuel natural gas vehicle, requiring
only the flip of a switch to operate on either natural gas or
gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   The '99 Escort ($11,280) comes with $1,000 worth of additional
equipment at no charge _ items such as aluminum wheels, luggage
rack, rear wiper, and cargo-area cover. The Escort seats five and
comes as a sedan or five-door wagon. The car was ranked best
compact car in initial quality in 1998 by J.D. Powers.
</P>
<P>
   For those who want an Escort with zip, Ford last year introduced
the ZX2 ($12,580). This year, Ford adds a ``hot'' and a ``cool''
model with design and amenity features to appeal to its youthful
buyers. ``ZX2's zesty ride, sporty appearance, affordable price,
and low operating costs appeal to youthful buyers _ or anyone else
who tries to enjoy life without busting their budget,'' says Kevin
Smith, ZX2 brand manager.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's most popular family vehicle, the Taurus ($17,995), enters
'99 with price cuts of $1,000 to almost $2,000 on various models.
Ford is also dropping the charge for emissions equipment, which was
$170. The Taurus comes with a choice of three engines _ a V-6 with
145 horsepower, a V-6 with 185 horsepower, or the high-performance
SHO version with a 235 horsepower V-8. The car can go 100,000 miles
between tune-ups.
</P>
<P>
   The base price for the '99 Mustang is still not settled, but
according to Janine Bay, chief program engineer, ``We've made
improvements that are much more than skin-deep. The 1999 Mustang is
true to its roots _ customers get an exciting new design with
enhanced performance.'' Besides new looks, Mustang, which traces
its heritage back 35 years, has added power to both the V-6 and V-8
engines, and _ for the first time _ has an optional traction
control system that works at all speeds. The car comes with a
five-speed manual, or an optional four-speed automatic
transmission.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the models, there are improvements ranging from
chassis to reduce noise and vibration to a long track for the
driver's seat to accommodate taller drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Ford also produces the Windstar ($19,180) minivan with dual
sliding doors and optional power on both doors, the Ford Explorer
($19,980), and the huge Expedition ($27,985) sport-utility
vehicles.

   The Honda Accord is still the No. 1 selling car in America. It,
and the all-new Odyssey ($24,000) minvan, lead Honda into the '99
model year. The Accord ($15,100), redesigned last year, has few
changes for '99; the biggest one is to meet more stringent
emissions levels.
</P>
<P>
   The Accord is available as a two-door coupe or a four-door
sedan. Station wagons have been discontinued. Buyers can select
either a four-cylinder or a V-6 engine mated to either a five-speed
manual or an automatic transmission. Accord claims a more spacious
interior than its two closest competitors, the Taurus or Camry.
</P>
<P>
   The new Odyssey minivan features center row captain's chairs
that can be moved together to form a bench seat. The midsize van is
powerful, offers good handling and has many new innovative
features.
</P>
<P>
   The Civic ($10,600), Honda's compact, comes in sedan, hatchback,
or coupe versions and has won the best-selling small car award for
the last two years. New styling touches have been added to the '99
model, which comes in a wide variety of trim levels.
</P>
<P>
   For the sporty crowd, Honda offers the Prelude ($23,000), a
coupe with nimble performance. Its four-cylinder engine has added
five horsepower, making it 200 hp, with a manual transmission.
Automatic drive is also available.
</P>
<P>
   Honda also offers the Isuzu-built Passport ($23,850)
sport-utility vehicle, featuring a V-6 engine and 4-wheel drive.

   Hyundai has completely redesigned its compact Sonata ($14,800).
This four-door sedan, which offers a choice of a four- or a
six-cylinder engine, has added room inside: The car is wider and
there is an inch more headroom. A 170-horsepower V-6 engine is
available and can be mated to a smoother shifting manual or a new
adaptive-logic automatic transmission, which changes the
transmission shifting patterns to suit the driver.
</P>
<P>
   The Elanta ($11,500) gets a limited facelift in its sedan and
wagon series, along with a beefed-up engine. These four-door
compacts now have the same peppy engine found in the sport Hyundai
Tiburon.
</P>
<P>
   The Tiburon ($13,600) hatchback offers hot styling, high
performance, and low price. There are no changes in the '99
version.

</P>
<P>
   Infiniti has an all-new G20 ($20,995). This entry-level Infiniti
has lots of nice touches and is bigger with better handling and
performance than when it was last produced in '96. It comes with a
140-horsepower, 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine from the Nissan
Sentra. Its suspension also borrows from the European-marketed
Primera. A Bose sound system is standard, along with side-impact
airbags.
</P>
<P>
   Infiniti's flagship Q45 ($47,900) now offers electronically
modulated shocks with selective settings and other refinements
including Xenon gas headlights.
</P>
<P>
   The midsize I30 ($28,900) has only minor changes for '99. Among
them, traction control is an option, and the antitheft system has
an engine immobilizer.
</P>

<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ES300 ($30,905), Lexus' entry-level model, gets a new drive
train for 1999. The 3.0-liter V-6 engine employs continuously
variable valve timing to creater higher horsepower, lower emissions
and improved fuel economy, while at the same time boosting
low-revolutions per minute torque for acceleration.
</P>
<P>
   The new engine was first introduced in the '99 sport-utility
Lexus RX300 ($31,550) and is exclusive to the Lexus Division. With
the addition of the new engine and transmission, the ES300 now has
75 percent of its components, including sheet metal, unique to the
ES300 or other Lexus models. It is no longer a dressed-up Camry.
</P>
<P>
   The front-wheel drive ES300 offers as an option an Adaptive
Variable Suspension system that tracks road surface conditions,
speed and other factors to continuously change each wheel's
shock-absorber settings. This also permits the driver to select the
desired range of ride character from sport to comfort.
</P>
<P>
   The Lexus LS400 ($53,605) is the company's flagship luxury sedan
and rated one of the finest vehicles in production today. With its
new generation V-8 engine with Variable Valve Timing, the car is
tuned for greater engine performance, better fuel economy and
reduced pollution. Coupled to a five-speed automatic, the car
sprints to 60 miles an hour in 6.6 seconds. It is not only
comfortable and quiet to drive, but also quite nimble when called
on. The LS400 is loaded with safety and comfort features; standard
is a Vehicle Skid Control system that monitors vehicle handling and
helps compensate for loss of lateral traction in slippery
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The GS400 ($45,505) and GS300 ($37,305) are four-door sports
sedans loaded with comfort and performance features. The GS400
comes with a 300-horsepower V-8 engine, and the GS300 offers a
six-cylinder that goes from 0-60 m.p.h in 7.6 seconds (the V-8 does
it in 6 seconds). Both models look nimble but have excellent space
inside. Lexus says the cars go ``beyond cab-forward designs, with
the cabin and trunk space of large prestige luxury models.'' Among
standard safety features are the Vehicle Skid Control and
electronic traction control.
</P>
<P>
   The Lexus SC coupe series also comes in two models, the 300 and
400. Enhancements for 1999 include audio system improvements,
larger brakes for the SC300, daytime running lights and a 3-spoke
steering wheel design similar to that of the GS series sports
sedans. The SC300 ($42,905) has a 3.0-liter six-cylinder engine
that can hit 60 m.p.h. in 7.9 seconds, the SC 400 ($55,205) has a
4.0-liter V-8 engine rated with 290 horsepower.

   For 1999, the Continental ($38,325) adds side airbags for driver
and front passenger. This luxury vehicle seats five quite
comfortably and has had its horsepower upped from 260 to 275.
Safety features include antilock brakes, traction control, Michelin
tires capable of running 100 miles without air and a Remote
Emergency Satellite Cellular Unit, which automatically calls for
assistance when any air bags deploy. Lincoln notes the Continental
has more front headroom and overall interior and trunk space than
its competitor, the Cadillac DeVille.

   The Town Car ($38,325), which was redesigned last year giving it
a more contemporary design along with a smoother ride, adds side
airbags for front passengers this year. While 92 percent of Town
Car buyers cite seating capacity as the reason for buying the
vehicle, Jim O'Sullivan, Lincoln brand manager, notes, ``Engine
performance, prestige, and vehicle dynamics are Town Car's trump
cards in attracting new customers.''

   The Lincoln Navigator ($39,310), a more luxurious version of the
Ford Expedition, offers optional electrically adjustable brake and
accelerator pedals.

   Isuzu no longer offers car models in its lineup. Instead it is
concentrating on sport-utilities, the Rodeo ($18,000), a compact,
rear- or 4-wheel drive model, and the Trooper ($27,800), the
compnay's midsize 4-wheel drive model. It also offers a compact
minivan, the Oasis ($23,530), which is based on last year's Honda
Odyssey.
</P>
<P>
   Isuzu will be calling attention to itself this spring when it
brings its futuristic VehiCROSS sport-utility ($30,000) to the
marketplace. The VehiCROSS will come with a 215 horsepower V-6
engine mated to a four-speed automatic transmission and Isuzu's
Torque-on-Demand four-wheel drive system.

   Jaguar is pretty much sticking to its '98 offerings with minor
changes to tweak its V-8 engine. The XK8 coupe ($65,000), and the
XJ8 sedan ($54,800) are the two models. The XJ8 comes in four
versions _ the supercharged XJR, a stretched XJ8 L, and the super
luxurious Vanden Plas.

   Last spring, Mazda came out with a new Miata ($19,800), making
it even more loveable. For '99, the new two-seater makes putting
the top down a lot easier, drops the pop-up headlights, and offers
a quieter and more powerful ride.
</P>
<P>
   Soon to come on the market is an all-new subcompact
Protege &UR;  &LR; ($12,200), which is said to have the largest interior in
its class. Adding to its appeal will be a larger 105-horsepower
engine.
</P>
<P>
   Having just revamped the midsize 626 ($15,700) last year, this
model receives only minor changes for '99.
</P>
<P>
   Mazda's top-of-the-line sedan, the midsize Millenia ($26,000)
gets a facelift, but more importantly lower prices, with models
costing from $2,400 to $5,500 (for the top model with Miller Cycle
engine) less than last year.
</P>
<P>
   Mazda also offers a pickup, the B-series, and the MPV minivan.

   The Grand Marquis ($22,220), having undergone a major revamping
last year, adds more safety features, color, and trim changes for
the new model year. The major selling points on the vehicle are its
full-size roominess, trunk space, and rear-drive. With its
contemporary looks, it's a car that can fit in anywhere or
anyplace. It comes with PrecisionTrac, a suspension system that
provides excellent directional control even during strong
crosswinds. In a survey, 90 percent of its buyers cited the Grand
Marquis for quietness and cargo capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The Mystique ($16,925) adds extra leg room for back seat
passengers for '99. Other improvements include front suspension for
better ride, and brakes to provide a more stable braking on uneven
surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   The family-sized Sable ($18,445) enters the new year with lower
prices _ $1,000 to $2,000 less than last year _ along with interior
and exterior changes. The Sable has been awarded the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration's five-star rating for sedan
and wagon models. The Sable is also available with a no-charge
optional six-passenger seating configuration that includes a
flip-fold center seat that doubles as a console.
</P>
<P>
   The Tracer ($11,995), Mercury's small car, adds a sport wagon
with leather seating and 15-inch tires. The car comes with a
four-cylinder engine and four-speed automatic transmission.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougar ($16,595) is Mercury's one-of-a-kind vehicle _ it
doesn't share its looks with a Thunderbird as in year's past. The
Cougar is smaller than previous models, but also a lot more sporty
looking and offers better driving characteristics. While the Cougar
is based on the Mystique platform, its suspension and steering
elements have been recalibrated for sports car handling and
performance. The Cougar boasts individual bucket-style sports seats
designed for both comfort and support. The Cougar features optional
head and chest side air bags for the driver and front passenger.
</P>
<P>
   The company also offers the redesigned Mercury Villager
($20,350) with added space and doors, and the Mercury Mountaineer,
the company's sport-utility.

horsepower V-6 and a more comfortable interior.
</P>
<P>
   Its subcompact Mirage ($10,900) sedan is available in two- and
four-door models, and is relatively unchanged for '99.
</P>
<P>
   The sophisticated Diamante ($27,600), Mitsubishi's midsize
four-door sedan has only one model this year. It comes with V-6
power and an adaptive automatic that senses the driver's actions to
modify shifting patterns.
</P>
<P>
   For sports car lovers, Mitsubishi offers the subcompact Eclipse
($15,700), available with all-wheel drive and the hot performing
3000GT ($27,700-$46,000), also offered with AWD.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Mitsubishi's line-up are Montero ($33,500), a midsize

   Nissan has decided to drop its sporty models in favor of its
sedans, the Maxima and Sentra.
</P>
<P>
   Both vehicles come with few changes for '99. The Sentra
($11,500) is offered only as a four-door sedan, which comes with a
keyless entry system and five trim levels, including a Limited
Edition with CD player and front stabilizer bar.
</P>
<P>
   The Maxima ($21,500) provides sporty handling for a midsize
sedan. The Maxima is one of the few sedans that offers a five-speed
manual _ very smooth to operate. A four-speed automatic is also
offered to go with its 190 horsepower V-6 power plant.

   Nissan also markets the Quest ($23,000), a compact minivan, and
Pathfinder ($24,000), a four-door sport-utility.

   Oldsmobile enters the model year with a new nameplate, the
Alero, a compact entry-level sedan. The Alero ($16,300), like last
year's new model, Intrigue ($20,900), a midsize car, is designed to
be a foreign car fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Oldsmobile is pinning a lot of hope on the Alero, looking for up
to 150,000 sales, a tall order for a company that has been
suffering in overall sales. But the Alero offers a lot of promise
as a well-equipped vehicle with an attractive price. The Alero
comes in coupe and sedan versions with a choice of a four-cylinder
base engine or an optional V-6.
</P>
<P>
   The Alero continues Oldsmobile's efforts to gain a new image for
its second hundred years in business. The company celebrated its
100th birthday last year and is General Motors oldest division. As
part of its new countenance, Olds is creating an entire new product
line. New nameplates have replace the old. The Alero is not just a
revamped model, but an entirely new vehicle. In its quest to get a
new image _ ``It's not your father's Olds'' _ the company dropped
the Ninety Eight, will end production on the Eighty Eight in
December, and the Cutlass Supreme next summer.
</P>
<P>
   The new imaging has given Oldsmobile enough confidence to put
its nameplate back on its models. When the Aurora was introduced,
the name Oldsmobile could not be found on the vehicle. The same
happened with Intrigue, but now both models bear the Olds symbol.
</P>
<P>
   Oldsmobile's other models include the Intrigue, the luxurious
Aurora ($36,000), the luxury minivan Silhouette ($24,000), and the
fancy sport utility, the Bravada ($30,700).

   The Plymouth brand has only one sedan in its line, the Breeze
($14,800), similar to the Chrysler Cirrus and Dodge Stratus. The
Breeze is designed for affordability, and while sharing the same
body as the Cirrus and Stratus, it lacks some of the standard
equipment of the others. It is offered also in a Style package with
added equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The hot-rod styled Prowler ($36,000) enters its second
production year with a new 3.5-liter, V-6 aluminum engine and some
new colors. In addition to Prowler Purple, an eye-popping yellow
and, soon, red and black are on the color shopping list.
</P>

   It's the year of the Grand Am at Pontiac. Introduced last
spring, the Grand Am ($15,900) with its aggressive styling, is
Pontiac's best seller. For '99, the Grand Am has a 3.6-inch longer
wheelbase and is available with a new high-end engine that produces
170 horsepower, an increase of 15 more horsepower than the previous
V-6. Other engines range from a four-cylinder to the new V-6.
Available in coupe or sedan, its body is now stiffer, braking
better, and quieter on the inside.

   What's new (and in some cases, not so new) in the world of cars,
minivans, trucks and SUVs? While some models indicate few or no
changes for '99, most have been completely updated over the last
couple of years. All prices shown are approximate base figures;
many manufacturers have not set final prices. Where more than one
model is listed, the price reflects the lowest priced model.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ACURA
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The all-new Acura 3.2TL sedan offers not only comfort but also a
more agile feel in its handling. The four-door 3.2 TL comes loaded
for around $29,000. About the only option is a navigation system
that guarantees you'll never get lost again. The sedan also has a
new V-6 engine with 225 horsepower and a SportShift automatic
transmission.
</P>
<P>
   For its flagship 3.5 RL sedan ($41,200), the car maker offers
refinements _ 400 changes the company says _ from better braking
and added air bags to sportier handling.
</P>
<P>
   The sporty entry-level Acura Integra ($19,200) now comes with
15-inch alloy wheels. The Acura 3.0 CL Coupe ($22,400) adds
amenities such as heated front seats to its base model. The
Integera shares much of its mechanics with the Honda Accord EX
coupe.
</P>
<P>
   For high-tech, high performance, Acura offers the NSX ($84,000),
unchanged for '99. The company also has the SLX sport-utility
($36,000), which is really an Isuzu Trooper with the Acura badge.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; AUDI
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New this year is Audi's A6 Avant ($36,600) station wagon. The
sporty looking model comes with low-powered front airbags and
airbags in the side panels. Rear seat side airbags are also
available as an option.
</P>
<P>
   The Avant is also offered in the A4 ($34,500) series and it
comes with new options with its Quattro all-wheel drive. The
transmission can be either a five-speed automatic with Tiptronic,
or a five-speed manual.
</P>
<P>
   The A4 ($23,800), A6 ($33,700) and A8 ($57,400) sedans are given
added features and other improvements for '99. The A8, Audi's
luxurious sedan, includes a warm-weather package that offers
rear-window shades and a solar sunroof that circulates air while
the car is parked.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; BENTLEY
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   A new sedan, the Arnage ($230,800), with a twin-turbo, 4.4-liter
BMW V-8 engine is Bentley's featured model for '99. The sedan
shares many parts with the V-12 Rolls-Royce Silver Seraph.
</P>
<P>
   If it seems strange to have a BMW engine in a Bentley, it
shouldn't: BMW has been building engines for the company with the
intent of purchasing the firm. However, BMW lost out in its bid for
Rolls-Royce/Bentley to Volkswagen. While VW now owns one of the
most prestigious nameplates in the auto world, it appears the
company building Rolls and Bentley didn't own the Rolls-Royce name.
So, BMW jumped in and bought the Rolls name, and now plans on
building the Rolls in a new factory around 2002. Until then, VW has
the Bentley name and will build those models. After 2002, VW will
just produce Bentleys. Other models in the Bentley lineup, the
Azure convertible and Continental R and Continental T, remain
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; BMW
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An all new 3-series sedan along with a 5-series wagon are new
for '99. While the newest 3-series _ the 318I and 328I sedans _
have been totally redone for '99, BMW will continue to sell the
coupe and convertible versions from '98 through next year, when
those models will begin their upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   The new sedans offer the performance and handling one expects
from a BMW, while providing additional space. The sedans are at
least an inch longer, wider and higher, and offer many design
touches that look like the far more expensive 5 and 7 series
models.
</P>
<P>
   The 323I ($27,000) has a 2.5-liter, six-cylinder, 170-horsepower
engine, while the 328Ii ($34,400) offers a 2.8-liter six-cylinder
engine with 193 horsepower. Both sedans are similar, but have
differences in power and luxury features.
</P>
<P>
   The new models offer traction control, along with Cornering
Brake Control for better handling on turns. In addition to front
dual airbags, BMWs offer an Inflatable Tubular Structure for head
protection and optional rear seat side-impact airbags as saftey
features.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-series wagon, which is returning to the lineup, is offered
as a 528I Sportwagon with an in-line six engine or as the 540I
Sportwagon with a V-8 power plant.
</P>
<P>
   A new coupe is being produced at BMW's South Carolina plant. The
Z3 ($29,500) Coupe 2.8 and the high-performance M Coupe join the Z3
roadster. The roadsters all come with inline six-cylinder engines
(the four-cylinder models have been dropped). While the Z3
convertible is a hot performer, the new M Roadster ($42,000) adds
to the thrill of owning a BMW with its larger engine, more rigid
body and wide tires for better road handling.
</P>
<P>
   The full-size BMW 7-Series ($61,500) models _ the 740I and 740iL
(4.5 inches longer) _ are luxurious in comfort, handling, and
performance.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; BUICK
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Say goodbye to the Riviera, Buick's two-door sporty coupe; it
was part of General Motors' cost-cutting plan to eliminate slow
selling models.
</P>
<P>
   In Buick's other models, the changes are mainly cosmetic. The
Century ($19,335), however, does get improvements in antilocking
brakes, suspension and traction control. The Regal ($22,255)
includes a tire-inflation monitor along with an additional
5-horsepower engine and optional 15-inch aluminum wheels. Regal
comes in two trim levels, the LS and GS. The LS comes with a
stiffer sportier ride along with improved suspension.
</P>
<P>
   LeSabre ($23,340) has few changes; the Park Avenue ($31,000),
Buick's full-size luxury sedan has a new stereo system.

   For the first time in its 96-year history, Cadillac offers a

vehicle.

<P>
   Massaging lumbar front seats are now offered on the Eldorado
($38,500), Seville ($42,500), and DeVille ($37,700). The seats are
standard on the Eldorado, optional on the others. Another seat
improvement found on the Seville is an adaptive seat that adjusts
automatically to fit the driver.

only a few changes, especially in exterior colors offered.
</P>

   The major news for Chevrolet is in its truck line with an
all-new Silverado ($15,995) full-size pickup complete with a new
family of V-8 engines.
</P>
<P>
   Also new is the Corvette ($37,500) hardtop, priced lower than
other models. The hardtop comes with Corvette's firm Z51 suspension
and six-speed manual transmission.
</P>
<P>
   Cavalier ($11,600), Chevrolet's top-selling model, will offer a
new bi-fuel sedan powered by compressed natural gas. The vehicle
offers a driving range of 160 miles and when that is reached,
switches to a gasoline tank for fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The midsize Chevy Lumina ($17,300), Monte Carlo coupe ($17,800),
compact Malibu ($15,700), and subcompact Metro ($8,900) remain
unchanged. The Metro is the model for those looking for outstanding
mileage, with EPA ratings of up to 44 miles per gallon. The Prizm
($12,200), the compact that Chevy shares with the Toyota Corolla,
was all new last year. There are reports Chevy may drop this model.
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet also offers the huge sport-utility Suburban ($25,600),
full-size Tahoe ($24,000), and the subcompact Tracker ($13,700),
along with the mid-size Venture minivan.

   Two stylishly designed sedans, loaded with features and
performance, along with the totally new Jeep Grand Cherokee, lead
Chrysler into the new century.
</P>
<P>
   The '99 LHS ($28,400), Chrysler's most luxurious sedan, along
with the performance-oriented, sleek 300M ($28,300) are all new for
this model year. The sedans, which have been available since
spring, join the Concorde, which was redesigned last year, as the
company's leading products.
</P>
<P>
   The LHS provides luxurious comfort for five in a spacious
cab-forward design and is powered by a smooth 253 horsepower V-6
engine.
</P>
<P>
   The 300M reflects Chrysler's history, displaying the heritage of
the famed 300s of the '50s and '60s. The car is designed not only
for performance, but to be sold internationally. Combining a
five-meter overall length with the most spacious interior of any
vehicle in the five-meter class allows the 300M to be sold
successfully not only in North America but also in 30 international
markets. The car is powered by Chrysler's new high-output 3.5-liter
V-6 engine, and comes with an AutoStick transmission, which
provides the control of a manual transmission with the convenience
of an automatic.

   Former pro wrestler Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura has won the
biggest bout yet for Ross Perot's Reform Party, raging out of the
far corner to capture the Minnesota Governor's Mansion and leaving
the nation blinking in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   Many Minnesotans were enthralled by Tuesday's outcome, even some
who didn't vote for the candidate who posed in a TV campaign ad as
Rodin's ``The Thinker'' in boxer shorts. Contacted at random by
telephone, several responded defensively to the national reaction,
insisting that Ventura will not make their state a laughingstock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let his actions speak for themselves,'' said Chad Lachmiller,
27, a soybean farmer and bartender in Good Thunder, Minn. ``His win
isn't going to hurt Minnesota's image. There's a lot of potential
that he'll be good for it. Jesse might bring in a whole new era in
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Deanne Thompson agreed, even though she didn't support Ventura
until after his victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'll be opening some eyes when he does a good job,''
said Thompson, 28, co-owner of Taco John's, a Mexican restaurant in
Thief River Falls, Minn., 55 miles south of the Canadian border. At
the very least, she said, Ventura will be no worse than other
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president can make a fool of himself, let's see what
Ventura can do,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Already, CBS-TV's David Letterman has done a Top Ten list on
Ventura's campaign slogans _ including ``It's the stupidity,
stupid'' and ``Finally, a governor whose shorts glitter.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, one of Ventura's toughest postelection decisions
was choosing between appearances on Letterman and Jay Leno, said
Dean Barkley, his campaign chairman, who founded the Minnesota
Reform Party in his living room six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever gets him will quickly see Jesse is not going to be an
object of humor,'' Barkley said. ``They're going to find out that
he's smart, has a quick wit and can counter any punch.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the 6-foot-4, 250-pound ex-Navy SEAL didn't emerge
directly from the wrestling ring to body-slam veteran politicians
in debates that turned around the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from bit parts in several Arnold Schwarzenegger films, he
was a radio talk show host of the ``shock jock'' genre in
Minneapolis, going head-to-head against Rush Limbaugh and
outdrawing him, Barkley said. And Ventura won high marks as an
unpaid reform-minded suburban mayor for five years after defeating
an 18-year incumbent by a 2-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   Crucially, his down-to-earth, low-budget campaign style enticed
huge numbers of first-time voters. The St. Paul Pioneer Press
reported that 12 percent of those responding to an exit poll said
they would not have cast a ballot if Ventura hadn't run.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were voters angry at, or bored with, the two
major-party candidates _ Republican St. Paul Mayor Norm Coleman and
liberal Democrat Hubert Humphrey III, son of the former vice
president. Ventura captured a 37 percent plurality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We beat a Humphrey in Minnesota _ these were no lightweight
candidates,'' Barkley said.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura downed half-pound hamburgers between campaign stops, and
he often appeared in bluejeans. He seldom made specific promises,
but he raised a few eyebrows by saying he'd consider legalizing
prostitution, suggesting that Nevada, or Amsterdam, the
Netherlands, might have the right approach.
</P>
<P>
   According to Barkley, Ventura neither asked for, nor got, any
help from Perot, the Reform Party's founder.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas billionaire made no campaign appearances for Ventura
and declined a request to help with a campaign loan, Barkley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They helped build the party,'' Barkley said of Perot and other
national Reform leaders. ``Did they do anything specifically in
this election in Minnesota? No.''
</P>
<P>
   There may be a reason.
</P>
<P>
   Back in July, Ventura told the Pioneer Press that he wasn't
exactly a Perot fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked Perot at first. He was a breath of fresh air,''
Ventura was quoted as saying. ``Then he got a little ding-y.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Perot wasn't available for interviews about
Ventura. Instead, he issued a three-sentence statement
congratulating him for giving ``hope back to the American people
that they can take their country back.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton reacted to Ventura's win with tongue in cheek:
``I think that you're going to have a lot of politicians spending
time in gyms now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party, seen as being in shambles before Tuesday, won
no other statewide race. Its next-best showing was 33 percent of
the vote in a two-way Florida congressional contest.
</P>
<P>
   Although Perot remained cautious in sharing the limelight, the
World Wrestling Federation chairman was less shy. Vince McMahon
immediately issued a statement taking full credit ``for teaching
Jesse Ventura the finer art of ...'' _ well, cow manure.
</P>
<P>
   In his new public arena, the former wrestler will learn that
he's accountable for his statements. The Associated Press reported
that Ventura immediately broke one of his more fanciful campaign
promises: He did not rappel into the state Capitol from a
helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about a pledge to return $1,000 in taxes to every
Minnesotan, a sleep-deprived Ventura muttered, ``Oh, sheesh.''
</P>
<P>
   What he was clear about was his new moniker.
</P>
<P>
   He's no longer ``The Body.'' As governor, he wants to be called
Jesse ``The Mind'' Ventura.

A LEVERAGED BUYOUT LEADER MAY HAVE HELPED SHAPE A HEALTHIER
ECONOMY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA MCUSIC 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hostile takeovers. Highly leveraged buyouts. Poison pills.
</P>
<P>
   The vernacular of management buyouts of companies in the 1980s
had a distinctively negative tone.
</P>
<P>
   Congress held multiple hearings, the business press wrote
unfavorable articles, union leaders screamed and journalists wrote
books with such titles as ``Barbarians at the Gate.''
</P>
<P>
   But were LBOs really bad for American business?
</P>
<P>
   Economist George Baker and historian George Smith argue the
opposite. Leveraged buyouts were not only good for the companies
that were taken over, they suggest, but they also shook the
American economy out of its doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   The two authors form this view after an intensive study of one
of the leading firms in the LBO craze _ Kohlberg Kravis Roberts.
They share this study and their overall economic analysis in ``The
New Financial Capitalists: Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the Creation
of Corporate Value,'' (Cambridge University Press, 257 pages,
$24.95).
</P>
<P>
   Their bottom line: KKR's leveraged buyoutss were far more than
paper transactions; rather, they formed an intricate link between
management and ownership that created ``the common pursuit of
value.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Business School professor Malcolum Satler puts it a
different way, calling KKR ``the repair shop of capitalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1976, Jerome Kohlberg, Henry Kravis and George
Roberts _ formerly of investment banker Bear, Stearns _ opened two
small offices. Their strategy was simple, although the financing
became quite complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trio would buy well-established, privately controlled
companies with predictable streams of revenue and cash flow,''
Baker and Smith write. ``In financing their acquisitions, they
borrowed nearly all of the money. ... Their success depended on a
combination of timely debt reduction and the promotion of
longer-term efficiency. If all went well (typically within five to
seven years), they resold the leveraged equity for substantially
higher-than-average gains.''
</P>
<P>
   If returns from the past 20 years are any indication, KKR has
been doing very well.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1976, it has handled more than $10.9 billion in equity
investments in about 58 companies valued at more than $40 billion,
Baker and Smith write. The firm's return on its investments have
been a whopping 28 percent annually from 1977 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   As for the effect of buyouts on the companies taken over, a
report by KKR's accounting firm _ Deloitte, Haskins &AMP; Sells _ shows
equally compelling results. For 17 of KKR's buyouts between 1977
and 1989, for which at least three years had passed, the companies
had increased employment, capital spending, and research and
development.
</P>
<P>
   Baker and Smith take readers through a number of these deals,
showing not only their initial financial setup, but also what KKR
did to improve their value over the years. In this analysis, the
writing team obtained unprecedented access to the files and
personnel of a very private firm.
</P>
<P>
   Originally hired as consultants to write a corporate history of
KKR, Baker and Smith decided to broaden the project into a book
with an outside publisher; KKR could review the material only for
factual errors. The results are an insider's view of the major
deals for which KKR is known, including the $31 billion buyout of
RJR Nabisco, much of which has not been written about so thoroughly
before.
</P>
<P>
   Although the authors point out the mistakes made by the firm
along with its highly profitable deals, Baker and Smith found KKR's
effect on the American economy nothing short of profound.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a more fundamental historical sense, KKR's legacy is this:
Its management buyouts breathed new life into a moribund system of
financial capitalism, which in turn stimulated a new era of
sustained economic growth, vibrant securities markets, and at this
writing, nearly full levels of employment,'' they write. ``... The
catalytic role of the management buyout cannot be denied.''

</P>
<P>
   By Terrence E. Deal and M.K. Key
</P>
<P>
   Berrett-Kohler, $24.95
</P>
<P>
   Let's party! Or so say authors Terrence Deal and M.K. Key, who
also teach at Vanderbilt University and are business consultants.
``Taking time to celebrate is an integral part of doing business,''
they write. ``The cost of the gathering is offset by the subsequent
dividends it reaps in employee morale, commitment and hard work.''
Because Americans are starting to do virtually all of their living
at work, office parties are becoming more important than ever. This
books tells you what others are doing and how they're doing it.

   ``Charging Ahead''

   This is the story of MIT mechanical engineering graduate James
Worden and his dream of developing and producing an electric car.
It is also the story of the American dream of an upstart company,
Solectria, and the growing pains of an entrepreneurial effort.
Finally, it's the story of the environment, specifically the air,
and how big money interests among oil and automakers are trying to
squelch efforts such as Worden's while killing regulations to clean
up the air. Author Joe Sherman also has written ``In the Rings of
Saturn,'' about the Saturn car plant in Tennessee.

   On Feb. 23, 1998, Al-Quds al-Arabi, an Arabic newspaper
published in London, printed the full text of a ``Declaration of
the World Islamic Front for Jihad against the Jews and the
Crusaders.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the paper, the statement was faxed to them under
the signatures of Osama bin Ladin, the Saudi financier blamed by
the United States for masterminding the August bombings of its
embassies in East Africa, and the leaders of militant Islamist
groups in Egypt, Pakistan and Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   The statement _ a magnificent piece of eloquent, at times even
poetic Arabic prose _ reveals a version of history that most
Westerners will find unfamiliar. Bin Ladin's grievances are not
quite what many would expect.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration begins with an exordium quoting the more
militant passages in the Quran and the sayings of the Prophet
Muhammad, then continues:
</P>
<P>
   ``Since God laid down the Arabian peninsula, created its desert,
and surrounded it with its seas, no calamity has ever befallen it
like these Crusader hosts that have spread in it like locusts,
crowding its soil, eating its fruits, and destroying its verdure;
and this at a time when the nations contend against the Muslims
like diners jostling around a bowl of food. ''
</P>
<P>
   The statement goes on to talk of the need to understand the
situation and act to rectify it. The facts, it says, are known to
everyone and fall under three main headings:
</P>
<P>
   ``First _ For more than seven years the United States is
occupying the lands of Islam in the holiest of its territories,
Arabia, plundering its riches, overwhelming its rulers, humiliating
its people, threatening its neighbors, and using its bases in the
peninsula as a spearhead to fight against the neighboring Islamic
peoples.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though some in the past have disputed the true nature of this
occupation, the people of Arabia in their entirety have now
recognized it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no better proof of this than the continuing American
aggression against the Iraqi people, launched from Arabia despite
its rulers, who all oppose the use of their territories for this
purpose but are subjugated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Second _ Despite the immense destruction inflicted on the
Iraqi people at the hands of the Crusader-Jewish alliance and in
spite of the appalling number of dead, exceeding a million, the
Americans nevertheless, in spite of all this, are trying once more
to repeat this dreadful slaughter. It seems that the long blockade
following after a fierce war, the dismemberment and the destruction
are not enough for them. So they come again today to destroy what
remains of this people and to humiliate their Muslim neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Third _ While the purposes of the Americans in these wars are
religious and economic, they also serve the petty state of the
Jews, to divert attention from their occupation of Jerusalem and
their killing of Muslims in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no better proof of all this than their eagerness to
destroy Iraq, the strongest of the neighboring Arab states, and
their attempt to dismember all the states of the region, such as
Iraq and Saudi Arabia and Egypt and Sudan, into petty states, whose
division and weakness would ensure the survival of Israel and the
continuation of the calamitous Crusader occupation of the lands of
Arabia.''
</P>
<P>
   These crimes, the statement declares, amount to ``a clear
declaration of war by the Americans against God, his Prophet, and
the Muslims. ''
</P>
<P>
   In such a situation, the declaration says, the ``ulema'' _
authorities on theology and Islamic law, or ``sharia'' _ throughout
the centuries unanimously ruled that when enemies attack the Muslim
lands, jihad becomes every Muslim's personal duty.
</P>
<P>
   In the technical language of the ulema, religious duties may be
collective, to be discharged by the community as a whole, or
personal, incumbent on every individual Muslim. In an offensive
war, the religious duty of jihad is collective and may be
discharged by volunteers and professionals. When the Muslim
community is defending itself, however, jihad becomes an individual
obligation.
</P>
<P>
   After quoting various Muslim authorities, the signatories then
proceed to the final and most important part of their declaration,
the fatwa, or ruling. It holds that
</P>
<P>
   ``To kill Americans and their allies, both civil and military,
is an individual duty of every Muslim who is able, in any country
where this is possible, until the Aqsa Mosque (in Jerusalem) and
the Haram Mosque (in Mecca) are freed from their grip and until
their armies, shattered and broken-winged, depart from all the
lands of Islam, incapable of threatening any Muslim.''
</P>
<P>
   After citing some further relevant Quranic verses, the document
continues:
</P>
<P>
   ``By God's leave, we call on every Muslim who believes in God
and hopes for reward to obey God's command to kill the Americans
and plunder their possessions wherever he finds them and whenever
he can. Likewise we call on the Muslim ulema and leaders and youth
and soldiers to launch attacks against the armies of the American
devils and against those who are allied with them from among the
helpers of Satan.''
</P>
<P>
   The declaration and fatwa conclude with a series of further
quotations from Muslim scripture.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Ladin's view of the Persian Gulf War as American aggression
against Iraq may seem a little odd, but it is widely _ though by no
means universally _ accepted in the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
   For holy warriors of any faith, the faithful are always right
and the infidels always wrong, whoever the protagonists and
whatever the circumstances of their encounter. The three areas of
grievance listed in the declaration _ Arabia, Iraq and Jerusalem _
will be familiar to observers of the Middle Eastern scene. What may
be less familiar is the sequence and emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   For Muslims, as we in the West sometimes tend to forget but
those familiar with Islamic history and literature know, the holy
land par excellence is Arabia _ Mecca, where the Prophet was born;
Medina, where he established the first Muslim state; and the Hijaz,
whose people were the first to rally to the new faith and become
its standard-bearers.
</P>
<P>
   For Muslims, no piece of land once added to the realm of Islam
can ever be finally renounced, but none compares in significance
with Arabia and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Of these two, Arabia is by far the more important. The classical
Arabic historians tell us that in the year 20 after the hijra
(Muhammad's move from Mecca to Medina), corresponding to 641 of the
Christian calendar, the Caliph Umar decreed that Jews and
Christians should be removed from Arabia to fulfill an injunction
the Prophet uttered on his deathbed: ``Let there not be two
religions in Arabia.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, to most Americans, the declaration is a travesty, a gross
distortion of the nature and purpose of the American presence in
Arabia. They should also know that for many _ perhaps most _
Muslims, the declaration is an equally grotesque travesty of the
nature of Islam and even of its doctrine of jihad.
</P>
<P>
   The Quran speaks of peace as well as of war. The hundreds of
thousands of traditions and sayings attributed with varying
reliability to the Prophet, interpreted in various ways by the
ulema, offer a wide range of guidance. The militant and violent
interpretation is one among many.
</P>
<P>
   The standard juristic treatises on sharia normally contain a
chapter on jihad, understood in the military sense as regular
warfare against infidels and apostates. But these treatises
prescribe correct behavior and respect for the rules of war in such
matters as the opening and termination of hostilities and the
treatment of noncombatants and prisoners, not to speak of
diplomatic envoys.
</P>
<P>
   The jurists also discuss _ and sometimes differ on _ the actual
conduct of war. Some permit, some restrict, and some disapprove of
the use of mangonels, poisoned arrows, and the poisoning of enemy
water supplies _ the missile and chemical warfare of the Middle
Ages _ out of concern for the indiscriminate casualties that these
weapons inflict.
</P>
<P>
   At no point do the basic texts of Islam enjoin terrorism and
murder. At no point do they even consider the random slaughter of
uninvolved bystanders.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, some Muslims are ready to approve, and a few of
them to apply, the declaration's extreme interpretation of their
religion. Terrorism requires only a few. Obviously, the West must
defend itself by whatever means will be effective. But in devising
strategies to fight the terrorists, it would surely be useful to
understand the forces that drive them.

<P>
   ``Third _ While the purposes of the Americans in these wars are
religious and economic, they also serve the petty state of the
Jews, to divert attention from their occupation of Jerusalem and
their killing of Muslims in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no better proof of all this than their eagerness to
destroy Iraq, the strongest of the neighboring Arab states, and
their attempt to dismember all the states of the region, such as
Iraq and Saudi Arabia and Egypt and Sudan, into petty states, whose
division and weakness would ensure the survival of Israel and the
continuation of the calamitous Crusader occupation of the lands of
Arabia.''
</P>
<P>
   These crimes, the statement declares, amount to ``a clear
declaration of war by the Americans against God, his Prophet, and
the Muslims. ''
</P>
<P>
   In such a situation, the declaration says, the ``ulema'' _
authorities on theology and Islamic law, or ``sharia'' _ throughout
the centuries unanimously ruled that when enemies attack the Muslim
lands, jihad becomes every Muslim's personal duty.
</P>
<P>
   In the technical language of the ulema, religious duties may be
collective, to be discharged by the community as a whole, or
personal, incumbent on every individual Muslim. In an offensive
war, the religious duty of jihad is collective and may be
discharged by volunteers and professionals. When the Muslim
community is defending itself, however, jihad becomes an individual
obligation.
</P>
<P>
   After quoting various Muslim authorities, the signatories then
proceed to the final and most important part of their declaration,
the fatwa, or ruling. It holds that
</P>
<P>
   ``To kill Americans and their allies, both civil and military,
is an individual duty of every Muslim who is able, in any country
where this is possible, until the Aqsa Mosque (in Jerusalem) and
the Haram Mosque (in Mecca) are freed from their grip and until
their armies, shattered and broken-winged, depart from all the
lands of Islam, incapable of threatening any Muslim.''
</P>
<P>
   After citing some further relevant Quranic verses, the document
continues:
</P>
<P>
   ``By God's leave, we call on every Muslim who believes in God
and hopes for reward to obey God's command to kill the Americans
and plunder their possessions wherever he finds them and whenever
he can. Likewise we call on the Muslim ulema and leaders and youth
and soldiers to launch attacks against the armies of the American
devils and against those who are allied with them from among the
helpers of Satan.''
</P>
<P>
   The declaration and fatwa conclude with a series of further
quotations from Muslim scripture.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Ladin's view of the Persian Gulf War as American aggression
against Iraq may seem a little odd, but it is widely _ though by no
means universally _ accepted in the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
   For holy warriors of any faith, the faithful are always right
and the infidels always wrong, whoever the protagonists and
whatever the circumstances of their encounter. The three areas of
grievance listed in the declaration _ Arabia, Iraq and Jerusalem _
will be familiar to observers of the Middle Eastern scene. What may
be less familiar is the sequence and emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   For Muslims, as we in the West sometimes tend to forget but
those familiar with Islamic history and literature know, the holy
land par excellence is Arabia _ Mecca, where the Prophet was born;
Medina, where he established the first Muslim state; and the Hijaz,
whose people were the first to rally to the new faith and become
its standard-bearers.
</P>
<P>
   For Muslims, no piece of land once added to the realm of Islam
can ever be finally renounced, but none compares in significance
with Arabia and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Of these two, Arabia is by far the more important. The classical
Arabic historians tell us that in the year 20 after the hijra
(Muhammad's move from Mecca to Medina), corresponding to 641 of the
Christian calendar, the Caliph Umar decreed that Jews and
Christians should be removed from Arabia to fulfill an injunction
the Prophet uttered on his deathbed: ``Let there not be two
religions in Arabia.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, to most Americans, the declaration is a travesty, a gross
distortion of the nature and purpose of the American presence in
Arabia. They should also know that for many _ perhaps most _
Muslims, the declaration is an equally grotesque travesty of the
nature of Islam and even of its doctrine of jihad.
</P>
<P>
   The Quran speaks of peace as well as of war. The hundreds of
thousands of traditions and sayings attributed with varying
reliability to the Prophet, interpreted in various ways by the
ulema, offer a wide range of guidance. The militant and violent
interpretation is one among many.
</P>
<P>
   The standard juristic treatises on sharia normally contain a
chapter on jihad, understood in the military sense as regular
warfare against infidels and apostates. But these treatises
prescribe correct behavior and respect for the rules of war in such
matters as the opening and termination of hostilities and the
treatment of noncombatants and prisoners, not to speak of
diplomatic envoys.
</P>
<P>
   The jurists also discuss _ and sometimes differ on _ the actual
conduct of war. Some permit, some restrict, and some disapprove of
the use of mangonels, poisoned arrows, and the poisoning of enemy
water supplies _ the missile and chemical warfare of the Middle
Ages _ out of concern for the indiscriminate casualties that these
weapons inflict.
</P>
<P>
   At no point do the basic texts of Islam enjoin terrorism and
murder. At no point do they even consider the random slaughter of
uninvolved bystanders.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, some Muslims are ready to approve, and a few of
them to apply, the declaration's extreme interpretation of their
religion. Terrorism requires only a few. Obviously, the West must
defend itself by whatever means will be effective. But in devising
strategies to fight the terrorists, it would surely be useful to
understand the forces that drive them.

<P>
   Terrorism is not a new phenomenon. But today's terrorists, be
they international cults like Aum Shinrikyo or individual nihilists
like the Unabomber, act on a greater variety of motives than ever
before.
</P>
<P>
   More ominously, terrorists may gain access to weapons of mass
destruction, including nuclear devices, germ dispensers, poison gas
weapons and even computer viruses.
</P>
<P>
   Also new is the world's dependence on a nearly invisible and
fragile network for distributing energy and information. Long part
of the Hollywood and Tom Clancy repertory of nightmarish scenarios,
catastrophic terrorism has moved from far-fetched horror to a
contingency that could happen next month.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States still takes conventional terrorism
seriously, as demonstrated by the response to the attacks on its
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August, it is not yet prepared
for the new threat of catastrophic terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   American military superiority on the conventional battlefield
pushes its adversaries toward unconventional alternatives. The
United States has already destroyed one facility in Sudan in its
attempt to target chemical weapons. Russia, storehouse of tens of
thousands of weapons and material to make tens of thousands more,
may be descending into turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the combination of new technology and lethal force
has made biological weapons at least as deadly as chemical and
nuclear alternatives. Technology is more accessible, and society is
more vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Elaborate international networks have developed among organized
criminals, drug traffickers, arms dealers and money launderers,
creating an infrastructure for catastrophic terrorism around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The bombings in East Africa killed hundreds. A successful attack
with weapons of mass destruction could certainly take thousands, or
tens of thousands, of lives.
</P>
<P>
   If the device that exploded in 1993 under the World Trade Center
had been nuclear, or had effectively dispersed a deadly pathogen,
the resulting horror and chaos would have exceeded our ability to
describe it.
</P>
<P>
   Such an act of catastrophic terrorism would be a watershed event
in American history. It could involve loss of life and property
unprecedented in peacetime and undermine America's fundamental
sense of security, as did the Soviet atomic bomb test in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Like Pearl Harbor, this event would divide our past and future
into a before and after. The United States might respond with
draconian measures, scaling back civil liberties, allowing wider
surveillance of citizens, detention of suspects and use of deadly
force.
</P>
<P>
   More violence could follow, either further terrorist attacks or
U.S. counterattacks. Belatedly, Americans would judge their leaders
negligent for not addressing terrorism more urgently.
</P>
<P>
   The danger of weapons of mass destruction being used against
America and its allies is greater now than at any time since the
Cuban missile crisis of 1962. It is a national security problem
that deserves the kind of attention the Pentagon devotes to threats
of military nuclear attack or regional aggression.
</P>
<P>
   The first obstacle to imagination is resignation. The prospects
may seem so dreadful that some officials despair of doing anything
useful.
</P>
<P>
   Some are fatalistic, as if contemplating the possibility of a
supernova. Many thinkers reacted the same way at the dawn of the
nuclear age, expecting doom to strike at any hour and disavowing
any further interest in deterrence as a hopeless venture. But as
with nuclear deterrence, the good news is that more can be done.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence role in preventing catastrophic terrorism is
complicated by ``placeless'' culprits, concealed weapons
development and unconventional deployments, all of which are hard
to monitor and preempt. In cyberattacks, for example, the
deployment of weapons can be entirely electronic.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government should therefore have the authority to
monitor any group and its potential state sponsors that might have
the motive and the means to use weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   In order to detect such weapons anywhere in the world, the
United States should utilize remote sensing technology and
cultivate global sources of information. Necessary measures include
clandestine collection of open sources, such as foreign newspapers
and the Internet, as well as a full exchange of information with
key allies.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a year before its attack on the Tokyo subway system the
Aum Shinrikyo group had used the nerve gas Sarin in assaults on
civilians. Although the Japanese media had reported the news, the
U.S. government remained in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Washington not hear what Japanese law-enforcement
agencies knew, but the Japanese agencies themselves were not aware
of what other local organizations in Japan had uncovered. The
parties involved did not share the expertise to prevent another
attack.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, U.S. intelligence lacks a place to perform
comprehensive planning for the collection of information, where the
yields from overhead reconnaissance, electronic surveillance,
clandestine agents, law-enforcement databases and informants, and
reports from foreign governments can be sifted and organized for
maximum effect.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence job is hard but not impossible. The would-be
terrorists have problems as well. If they are supported by a state,
their organizations tend to be either large and leaky or small and
feckless. If they are not backed by a state, the group may be
small, feckless and pathological too.
</P>
<P>
   These realities form the opportunities for intelligence success.
The national security agencies can seize the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic law-enforcement officials, understandably, do not
actively pursue intelligence collection but focus their efforts on
informants or other evidence in investigating suspected criminal
actions. Civil liberties properly discourage them from going out
and looking for criminals before they have evidence of a crime.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, domestic law enforcement has many techniques
for gathering data, including lawful wiretaps and grand-jury
investigations. Much of what these efforts yield, however, is
closed off to the national security community by law or regulation
to safeguard constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
   The United States needs a new institution to gather intelligence
on catastrophic terrorism _ a National Terrorism Intelligence
Center _ that would collect and analyze information so it could
warn of suspected catastrophic terrorist acts ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
   Since this center would have access to domestic law-enforcement
data, it should not be located at the Central Intelligence Agency.
Instead, the National Center should incorporate the highly
successful Director of Central Intelligence Counterterrorism
Center, which has a narrower mandate than this proposal, and be
located in the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
</P>
<P>
   However, the center would be run by an operating committee
chaired by the director of central intelligence and including the
director of the FBI, the deputy secretary of defense, the deputy
attorney general, the deputy secretary of state and the deputy
national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The National Foreign Intelligence Program, which already
provides support for the FBI's National Security Division, would
cover the center's budget, while the National Security Council
would take up unresolved disputes.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the center would come alternately from the FBI
and the CIA, and all intelligence organizations would provide a
specified number of professionals exempt from agency personnel
ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the center would combine the active intelligence
gathering approach of the national security agencies, which are not
legally constrained in their foreign investigations, with the
domestic authority and investigative resources of law enforcement
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   This combination is consistent with public trust and respect for
civil liberties. The center would have no powers of arrest and
prosecution and would maintain a certain distance from the
traditional defense and intelligence agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The center would also be subject to oversight from existing
institutions, like the federal judiciary, the President's Foreign
Intelligence Advisory Board, and the select intelligence committees
of Congress. Such a plan reconciles the practices of foreign
intelligence work with the restrictions that limit the reach of law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Catastrophic terrorism poses an eminent threat to America's
future. But the United States can fight back only if it sets the
right goals.
</P>
<P>
   In 1940 and 1941, the U.S. government pondered what kind of
forces it would need to wage a global war. The answers went so far
beyond the imagination that wry smiles and shaking heads in
Washington offices greeted the planning papers as they made their
rounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War saw a similar pattern of disbelief. The notion of
an intelligence system founded on photographic surveillance from
the upper atmosphere or outer space seemed outrageously far-fetched
in 1954, when the U-2 program was born. The films and cameras alone
seemed an overwhelming hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later the U-2s were flying; six years later
satellites were in place. Similar stories could be told about the
remarkable history of intercontinental missile guidance or the fast
deployment of more than a half-million troops and thousands of
armored vehicles to the Persian Gulf in 1991 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
   America can meet new challenges, but it must first imagine
success. Only then can it organize itself to attain it.

 &HT;    The following op-ed-length articles from the November/December
'98 issue of FOREIGN AFFAIRS, described in more detail below, have
moved on the wire _ in the ``k'' and ``a'' category codes _ from
The New York Times Syndicate.
 &HT;    _ They are also available in full-text versions, which range

 ISRAEL AFTER HEROISM  
 By Eliot A. Cohen  
 &HT;    (1,300 words) Above all, the murder of Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin in 1995 struck a blow at a major Israeli myth _ that no
matter how much bickering and bitterness pervade its politics, in
the end these are merely words, and the nation will stand together.

 THE IMF DID NOT PLAY RUSSIAN ROULETTE  
 By David D. Hale  
 &HT;    (1,400 words) Critics charge that the IMF's loans to Russia were
imprudent and wasteful. But the IMF failed to stem the Russian
collapse not because its reform package was flawed but because
Russia's domestic woes _ combined with its sensitivity to the
global slump in oil and commodity prices _ were too severe to
prevent market panic. Had the $22 billion IMF package for Russia
been as large as its $40 billion bailout of Mexico in 1995, it
might have helped.

 GEORGE BUSH PUBLISHES MEMOIRS of HISTORIC ERA  
 By Michael Howard  
 &HT;    (1,300 words) No one is under oath when writing their memoirs,
but the joint account by former President George Bush and his
national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, has better credentials
than most. By the summer of 1989, events in Europe were moving so
fast that ``the vision thing'' became largely irrelevant. All the
United States could do, in Bush's words, was encourage, guide and
manage change. This required seat-of-the-pants planning, not a
vision of a new world order.

 NATIONS HATE TO SAY `SORRY'

 &HT;    (1,500 words) Japanese people are famously polite, apologizing
at the start and end of every conversation and many times in

more remarkable. If the Japanese regularly apologize for being a
nuisance, even when they are not, why will they not show regret for
the slaughter of millions?

<P>
   Documents relating to diplomacy in Bosnia _ including Richard
Holbrooke's memoir ``To End a War'' and the State Department's 1996
official study of the process leading to the Dayton Accords of
November 1995 _ show that American officials were painfully aware

   Today, quietly, without most Americans noticing, a revolution
has turned the U.S. defense industry upside down. The idea that
every time you sell a satellite overseas, you make a profit but
lose a little bit of your military edge _ harks back to a time when
CIA bean counters worried over every uptick in Soviet technology,
and when the U.S. defense industry was sequestered in top-secret
grandeur, spending untold billions on weapons designed exclusively
for the Pentagon, with older-generation models going to America's
Cold War allies.

 &HT;    (1,300 words) Above all, the murder of Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin in 1995 struck a blow at a major Israeli myth _ that no
matter how much bickering and bitterness pervade its politics, in
the end these are merely words, and the nation will stand together.

 THE IMF DID NOT PLAY RUSSIAN ROULETTE  
 By David D. Hale  
 &HT;    (1,400 words) Critics charge that the IMF's loans to Russia were
imprudent and wasteful. But the IMF failed to stem the Russian
collapse not because its reform package was flawed but because
Russia's domestic woes _ combined with its sensitivity to the
global slump in oil and commodity prices _ were too severe to
prevent market panic. Had the $22 billion IMF package for Russia
been as large as its $40 billion bailout of Mexico in 1995, it
might have helped.

 GEORGE BUSH PUBLISHES MEMOIRS of HISTORIC ERA  
 By Michael Howard  
 &HT;    (1,300 words) No one is under oath when writing their memoirs,
but the joint account by former President George Bush and his
national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, has better credentials
than most. By the summer of 1989, events in Europe were moving so
fast that ``the vision thing'' became largely irrelevant. All the
United States could do, in Bush's words, was encourage, guide and
manage change. This required seat-of-the-pants planning, not a
vision of a new world order.

 NATIONS HATE TO SAY `SORRY'  
 By Nicholas D. Kristof  
 &HT;    (1,500 words) Japanese people are famously polite, apologizing
at the start and end of every conversation and many times in

more remarkable. If the Japanese regularly apologize for being a
nuisance, even when they are not, why will they not show regret for
the slaughter of millions?

   To most Americans, the success or failure of U.S. foreign policy
no longer seems a matter of life and death. We invest fewer
resources in defense, diplomacy and development. But the demands
upon us have not lessened. The patterns of world affairs shift with

   Documents relating to diplomacy in Bosnia _ including Richard
Holbrooke's memoir ``To End a War'' and the State Department's 1996

every time you sell a satellite overseas, you make a profit but

CIA bean counters worried over every uptick in Soviet technology,

for the Pentagon, with older-generation models going to America's
Cold War allies.

 &HT;    With photos placed in the International folder on the Cox

 &HT;    For Use Saturday, Nov. 7 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ He's being called a chip of the old block, the Soviet
bloc.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old grandson of the late Leonid Brezhnev, the
bear-like Soviet leader of the Cold War, recently formed his own
political party.
</P>
<P>
   But Andrei Brezhnev's All-Russian Communist Social and Political
Movement is a party his authoritarian grandfather, who ruled from
1964-82, would probably skip.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Brezhnev, a Russian businessman, dares to assert
that Russian communism should embrace concepts such as private
ownership of property and economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   In a country already crowded with dozens of major and minor
political parties, Brezhnev's initiative is a long shot. He is a
political neophyte and virtually unknown, despite his surname.
</P>
<P>
   But he underscores the predicament facing the present-day
Communist Party, led by Gennady Zyuganov, the parliamentary leader
who finished second to Boris Yeltsin in the 1996 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party endures as Russia's most popular political
movement -- supported by about one of every four Russians,
according to polls. Likewise, Zyuganov is among the country's
favorite politicians.
</P>
<P>
   But the party is riven by internal disputes over ideology and
organization, and suffers an identity crisis as Russia struggles to
adapt to democracy and a market economy.
</P>
<P>
   Its membership ranges from devout Marxists to Western
European-style social democrats. In control of parliament, it has
blocked initiatives for the private ownership of farms and hindered
joint ventures between Russia and Western companies to drill for
oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brezhnev's communism had the same character as Stalin's,'' the
younger Brezhnev explained in a recent interview with the Cox News
Service. ``It was totalitarian. It stayed the same while everything
around it changed. It should have adapted itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Communism in Russia today suffers a similar problem.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on its vast Soviet-era organization of political and
labor unions, the Communist Party can rally hundreds of protesters
onto the streets, as it did in a nationwide protest against Yeltsin
and his government's policies in early October.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with the nation's economy a wreck and Yeltsin ailing both
politically and physically, the Communist Party seems unable to
seize the initiative and offer Russians a clear alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the
Communist Party has failed to overhaul its image, said Sergei
Markov of the Institute for Political Studies. ``They keep making
political assaults on the government, but offer no real policy
other than dreams of yesterday's glories.''
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to exploit the Communist Party's popularity and
lack of initiative, Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov -- a popular
nationalist who enthusiastically supported Yeltsin in 1996 and who
wants to replace him as president in 2000 -- has explored a
possible campaign alliance of reformers and Communists.
</P>
<P>
   Like the younger Brezhnev, Luzhkov has voiced a belief that he
can blaze a third path between the hard-line communism of Soviet
times and the gluttonous capitalism that over the past decade has
made relatively few Russians rich and many more poor.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov, a leading contender to replace Yeltsin when his term
expires in mid-2000, has advocated mending the welfare state, but
on the basis of a market economy -- a political middle ground
between ``total socialism and vulgar liberalism,'' he said in a
recent speech.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of communism rests primarily among pensioners and
laborers, who are nostalgic for the certainty of the Brezhnev era.
In contrast to the current economic throes, in those days Russians
knew what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time everybody knew what their job was, and where they
stood in the hierarchy,'' said the younger Brezhnev, who possesses
the same pug nose, bushy eyebrows and thick shock of hair as his
grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   The return in recent weeks of several Communists to the
government of the new prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, has stirred
fears that Russia could revert to Soviet-style economic and social
controls.
</P>
<P>
   A poll conducted in late October by the Russian Public Opinion
Center found Russians virtually divided on what would result if
Communists returned to power. Thirty-nine percent said that if the
Communists came to full power in Russia they would implement a
hybrid of socialist policies while preserving private property and
without blocking post-Soviet market-oriented changes.
</P>
<P>
   But 36 percent said a Communist return would result in Russia
reverting back to pre-reform times by nationalizing banks and
industry, prohibiting private property and reinstating a command
economy. The remaining 25 percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people are afraid of the mere word,'' Brezhnev explained.
``Our task is to make communism more attractive to people.''

<P>
   ORANGER, Haiti _ Born into obscene poverty, Ileus Viltine, a
dust-covered farmer who's never ventured far from his rough swath
of land, is determined not to die that way.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his 67 years, this withered man's had no electricity.
No running water. The only roof over his head was one made of
coconut leaves.
</P>
<P>
   In short, he's had no real way to eke out an existence.
</P>
<P>
   But all that's changed in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   This diminutive peasant -- with no education, no special skills
-- now has something akin to winning the lottery, something to call
his very own.
</P>
<P>
   He has goats.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the frisky animals with floppy ears don't look
like much. But they've brought in money that's done more than build
a tin roof and send his children to school.
</P>
<P>
   It's given him a sense of pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I didn't have anything, not even a roof to keep the
rain off of my family,'' said Viltine, smiling through a few teeth
and bad cataracts. ``Now I have something to feel good about,
something to do so I can help my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Viltine is just one of some 1,200 indigent farmers who have
received a pregnant Nubian-bred goat as part of the Haitian Goat
Project, sponsored by Global Health Action, an Atlanta-based
non-profit agency.
</P>
<P>
   Launched in 1985, the program includes farmer training, ongoing
education, immunizations, and veterinary care for the goats.
</P>
<P>
   It targets the poorest of the poor -- half of whom are women --
in a nation where per-capita income is barely $250 per year.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, so poor is education in Viltine's village that scarcely
anyone reads or writes, yet farmers easily recite the dates their
animals were born.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farmers are excited because, in the past, their goats usually
died of diarrhea or other diseases,'' said Franck(CQ) Toussaint,
the program's coordinator in Haiti, where he trains about 12 new
farmers every month. ``But now the farmers are being taught how to
recognize various diseases and what to do about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Six hundred miles from the coast of Florida, Haiti has been
called the slum of the Western Hemisphere, a place where nearly
two-thirds of the land cannot be cultivated since it slopes at such
a steep angle.
</P>
<P>
   Global Health Action's project operates in a rocky, mountainous
region just west of Port-au-Prince, the capital, that's dotted by
obscure villages filled with badly thatched huts that are no bigger
than two-person tents.
</P>
<P>
   For years the goat was like an undiscovered Cinderella in these
parts: they were seen, but their true potential was never realized
-- that is until Global Health Action intervened.
</P>
<P>
   The organization works with Haitian farmers to cross-breed the
smaller Haitian goat the Nubian goat, which is a larger
milk-producing kind that's imported from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The aim is to improve the quality of Haitian goats by
integrating the mixed-breed kids into the herds here.
</P>
<P>
   Global Health Action's project is modeled on Heifer Project
International, the Little Rock, Ark.-based charity that donates
farm animals to families in 115 different Third World countries.
</P>
<P>
   The goats are perfectly suited to Haiti's steep, rugged terrain
and tropical climate, and don't cause a lot of erosion with their
hoofs. In addition, they require less land, feed and water than
cows.
</P>
<P>
   And their meat -- called cabrit (pronounced ``Ka-breet'') -- is
more popular here than beef.
</P>
<P>
   Global Health Action collaborates with the School of Veterinary
Medicine at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge to provide
on-site care and training in Haiti -- generally twice a year -- so
that families can continue breeding their goats to generate a
continuous income, while at the same time using the milk and meat
for food.
</P>
<P>
   Today, after years of being mostly overlooked, the goats living
in this village perched high atop a mountain have taken on almost
mythical qualities.
</P>
<P>
   They are said to be hardy, agile, and intelligent.
</P>
<P>
   Their milk is so nutritious -- just two cups is enough to supply
a person with a day's worth of protein -- that goats have become a
key weapon in the fight against malnutrition, which affects half of
all children here under age 5.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important to the farmers, the goats can be sold at
market for up to $50 each, depending on their size, enough money to
pay for books, clothing, and education for their children.
</P>
<P>
   In general, a Nubian-bred goat sells for more than twice the
price of a native Haitian goat.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my grandmother was sick, I sold a goat to help take care
of her,'' said Eliane Kouyou, 46, a gap-toothed woman with matted
dreadlocks who's not more than four feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now she's dead, and I am alone,'' she added, dragging an
uncooperative 75-pound goat behind her. ``The goats are all I have
to get by.''
</P>
<P>
   Kouyou owns three goats that have had six kiddings. In the past
year or so, she's sold four goats for a total of about $120.
</P>
<P>
   Before the goat project, Kouyou's dreary village was a place
where bare subsistence and self-sufficiency went hand in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Here, finding drinking water's a daily dilemma. Almost everyone
wears ill-fitting, hand-me-down clothes. There's little word of
news from nearby Port-au-Prince, which seems a world away.
</P>
<P>
   But the faces of the villagers light up faster than a Christmas
tree on one recent weekday when a team that included Bruce Olcott,
associate professor of veterinary medicine at LSU, and three
veterinary students arrived by horseback.
</P>
<P>
   It had taken them close to two hours to make the trek up the
narrow, treacherous paths from the group's base of operations at an
Episcopal mission in the town of Darbonne, some 35 miles west of
Port-au-Prince.
</P>
<P>
   It was a summit, of sorts, that attracted farmers, their
families, about 75 squealing goats, and dozens of giggling
children.
</P>
<P>
   And, in an isolated area not used to white faces, it was an
event of great color and drama, with women donned in their Sunday
best.
</P>
<P>
   Under a sweltering sun, the farmers waited patiently for hours
without pushing or shoving to have their goats checked over.
</P>
<P>
   Olcott and his students worked diligently, examining each of the
goat's fecal matter for the appearance of blood-sucking worms.
</P>
<P>
   They trimmed the goats' hoofs to prevent foot rot. They
sprinkled powder on the goats' coats to fight lice. They gave the
goats tetanus shots, plus two other injections to guard against
worms and bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Through interpreters, the foreigners threw goat-related
questions in English at the farmers, who responded in Haitian
Creole.
</P>
<P>
   Making his sixth trip to Haiti, Olcott is clearly hooked on the
people and what can be accomplished through the program.
</P>
<P>
   He brings a select group of students each time he visits to hone
skills while exposing them to a Third World environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people have nothing, and they are so thankful to have a
chance to make their lives better,'' said Olcott, who contracted
dengue fever and nearly fell down a mountain when his horse lost
its footing on earlier trips.
</P>
<P>
   One of those people is Rose Marie Elisse, who's sold her goats
to pay for two years of sewing school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am learning how to make dresses,'' said Elisse, 25, with an
ear-to-ear grin. ``I hope to make that my profession.''

   KUWAIT _ This is a city of gleaming towers and modern palaces.
Though men wear Arab robes and homes feature eastern designs, there
are few physical remnants of history.
</P>
<P>
   But on Kuwait City's Persian Gulf coast, at one of the six
five-star hotels, Kuwaitis are trying to reconstruct a piece of
their lost heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next two years, they should finish construction on a
mammoth replica of the long-gone family of cargo ships called dhows
(rhymes with ``now''), which were essential before Kuwait hit the
oil jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   Bulky ships like these cruised the Persian Gulf and neighboring
waters until the middle of the century, laden with tea, spices,
sugar, rice, wood and even race horses.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwaitis, living the hard desert life, even sent the ships to
Iraq next door for drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   Billions of dollars in oil money later, Kuwaitis can convert the
sea water into drinking water and oil tankers and U.S. aircraft
carriers are the kings of the waters.
</P>
<P>
   In character with the modern Kuwait, the big brown hull rising
off the grounds of the Radisson SAS hotel won't be hauling
anything, or even sailing. Rather, it will serve as an
air-conditioned conference hall -- complete with gold leaf
decoration -- more than six times the size of its ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   It's owners bill it as the largest wooden ship in the world and
have the Guiness Book of World's Records on notice. That claim may
depend on its specific classification or how it is measured, as the
U.S.S. Constitution and a handful of other old ships are larger.
</P>
<P>
   But, the ship, owned by the hotel's Kuwaiti owner, is an
impressive feat of engineering and striking blend of antiquity and
modern grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   The ship will measure about 275 feet long and about 60 feet
wide. The main mast will be about 177 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   Today, its hull is a curved and spiked collection of beams and
scaffolding dwarfing the 150 workers climbing around it.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the pressing and fitting of massive pieces of timber,
the project includes intricate, interlocking wood-carving to seal
the wood in place. The ship was designed on computers and every
piece is numbered.
</P>
<P>
   But the project is overseen by shipbuilder Mohammed Maskati, a
75-year-old Kuwaiti who used to sail the these ships. Back then,
trips could take six months and sailors, pressed for food and
water, were buffeted by the winds and sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality of the people is not the same now,'' Maskati said.
``You can't find people who want to suffer like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The construction of the new vessel, called the Al Hashemi II in
honor of an old ship, started in 1997 and is aimed at providing a
``new historical landmark'' for tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Relying on oil revenues, Kuwait is just starting to develop a
tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
   This ship will be the centerpiece of a freight and fishing
village. About 25 other ships will be portrayed in large-scale
models.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just to keep the heritage,'' says Maskati, who wears the
traditional white robe and head dress of the Gulf's Arabs. ``There
used to be 400 of these ships, now there are none.''
</P>
<P>
   And they were never this big.

   PETIONVILLE, Haiti _ Think cafe. Think trendy. Think computers.
Think people with a penchant for khakis and loafers who live to
surf the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Starring on the menu: espresso and cappuccino, of course.
</P>
<P>
   What is this, Seattle? No, it's a cyber-cafe -- and it's located
in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   The aptly-named Computer World is sandwiched between a pizza
parlor and a gas station in this tony suburb, high on a
mountainside overlooking -- but distanced from -- the squalor and
grime of Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince.
</P>
<P>
   It's an understatement to say that the business looks keenly out
of place in this country, where phone and electric service is
spotty, and most people battle with the daily dilemmas of finding
safe water and decent sanitation.
</P>
<P>
   But, clearly, Computer World is a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a dozen terminals with Internet access line the walls
inside this nondescript, two-story building, which is
air-conditioned -- a rarity here -- and decorated with space
age-style wallpaper covered with colorful drawings of the solar
system.
</P>
<P>
   The building includes a full-service coffee bar, as well as a
store, where everything from mouse pads to fax machines -- all
imported from discount chains in Miami -- is sold.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent weekday, the building was crowded with well-heeled
patrons who sent e-mail on computers that might cost the average
Haitian more than five years of their income.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can e-mail my friends back in the United States so I don't
have to send a letter, which would take 15 days to get there,''
said Nadine Seide, 28. ``I also use the computer to do research on
all of the graduate schools in the United States, where I plan to
study one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Seide recently graduated from college here, but has never owned
a computer and, even if she did, she couldn't access the Internet
since the phone at her house hasn't worked in six months.
</P>
<P>
   Like Seide, many customers linger for hours at Computer World,
which has a cozy, living-room atmosphere, as part of a ritual that
has become as essential to the day's routine as combing hair.
</P>
<P>
   They sip java, play games on CD-ROM, nosh on chicken nuggets,
and catch up with old friends.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, Computer World's not the domain of Everyman, but is
clearly geared toward Haiti's moneyed elite and expatriate
community.
</P>
<P>
   Credit for Computer World's success goes to Jonas Guillaume, an
ambitious entrepreneur who opened the cyber-cafe in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   And he'll take the credit with an American-style smile, proud of
opening the high-tech haven in such a low-tech environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born in Haiti and I just wanted to give something back
by helping people,'' said Guillaume, 32, who studied computer
science at the University of Montreal before living a few years in
Miami. ``And the people are just so happy to have something like
this available to them.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Western Hemisphere's poorest country, Haiti is generally
associated with malnutrition, not technology.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the population can't read or write, which explains
why, when computer networks were shrinking time and space in the
developed world, most folks here had never even heard of an
information superhighway.
</P>
<P>
   Today, only some 5,000 Haitians have access to the Internet
through four main servers available through private companies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are some fledgling efforts underway to expand the
use of computers.
</P>
<P>
   The Haitian government is currently developing an intranet to
connect their various ministries, which has been implemented across
corporate America at a feverish pace.
</P>
<P>
   And several computer schools have been opened in Port-au-Prince,
teaching crowded classrooms everything from Lotus to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly people are starting to understand that the computer is
the way of the future and that they will be left behind if they
don't know technology,'' said Michelle Karshan, a spokeswoman for
Haitian President Rene Preval.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, widespread use of the Internet has been
hampered by the phone service provided by Teleco, Haiti's aging
monopoly, which is so poor that there are fewer than 80,000 phone
lines to serve 8 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the more than 100,000 people currently waiting for phone
service have been waiting for years.
</P>
<P>
   And those lucky enough to already have phone service may lose
their line for months after a big rain.
</P>
<P>
   Service costs $10 a month in a nation where the average
per-capita income is $250.
</P>
<P>
   Under the country's economic reform program, Teleco is supposed
to pass to private hands.
</P>
<P>
   But all such deals need the prime minster's signature and the
former prime minister, Rosny Smarth, resigned in June 1997 and has
yet to be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a political impasse that's going to continue to hold
up investment and privatization,'' said Ernest Preeg, U.S.
ambassador to Haiti from 1981 to 1983.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't stopped Computer World, which avoids Teleco's
ground-based phone lines by using a router that picks up satellite
signals to make connections.
</P>
<P>
   Computer World also uses a generator and battery-powered
inverter to avoid the common power outages plaguing the country.
</P>
<P>
   All of this has contributed to the cyber-cafe's rising
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   At Computer World, Guillaume has sold memberships to more than
120 people for about $35 a month, for which they receive an e-mail
address and mailbox, plus 20 hours of Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Non-members can access the Internet for about $5 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   He also offers six-week training classes, at a cost of about
$300, for Internet novices.
</P>
<P>
   And there are plenty of them.
</P>
<P>
   Even many professionals here, such as doctors, lawyers, and
engineers, know almost nothing about surfing the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have people come in from the university asking me what the
Internet is and about how to use it, and I'm happy to be able to
teach them,'' Guillaume said.
</P>
<P>
   That's good news for people like Ida Morel, a nurse's aide eager
to learn how to use computers to do medical research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computers are not something we grow up with here, so having
Computer World is great,'' she said. ``I can come in, experiment
with computers, ask questions and get all the help I need.''

inside this nondescript, two-story building, which is
air-conditioned -- a rarity here -- and decorated with space
age-style wallpaper covered with colorful drawings of the solar
system.
</P>
<P>
   The building includes a full-service coffee bar, as well as a
store, where everything from mouse pads to fax machines -- all
imported from discount chains in Miami -- is sold.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent weekday, the building was crowded with well-heeled
patrons who sent e-mail on computers that might cost the average
Haitian more than five years of their income.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can e-mail my friends back in the United States so I don't
have to send a letter, which would take 15 days to get there,''
said Nadine Seide, 28. ``I also use the computer to do research on
all of the graduate schools in the United States, where I plan to
study one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Seide recently graduated from college here, but has never owned
a computer and, even if she did, she couldn't access the Internet
since the phone at her house hasn't worked in six months.
</P>
<P>
   Like Seide, many customers linger for hours at Computer World,
which has a cozy, living-room atmosphere, as part of a ritual that
has become as essential to the day's routine as combing hair.
</P>
<P>
   They sip java, play games on CD-ROM, nosh on chicken nuggets,
and catch up with old friends.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, Computer World's not the domain of Everyman, but is
clearly geared toward Haiti's moneyed elite and expatriate
community.
</P>
<P>
   Credit for Computer World's success goes to Jonas Guillaume, an
ambitious entrepreneur who opened the cyber-cafe in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   And he'll take the credit with an American-style smile, proud of
opening the high-tech haven in such a low-tech environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born in Haiti and I just wanted to give something back
by helping people,'' said Guillaume, 32, who studied computer
science at the University of Montreal before living a few years in
Miami. ``And the people are just so happy to have something like
this available to them.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Western Hemisphere's poorest country, Haiti is generally
associated with malnutrition, not technology.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the population can't read or write, which explains
why, when computer networks were shrinking time and space in the
developed world, most folks here had never even heard of an
information superhighway.
</P>
<P>
   Today, only some 5,000 Haitians have access to the Internet
through four main servers available through private companies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are some fledgling efforts underway to expand the
use of computers.
</P>
<P>
   The Haitian government is currently developing an intranet to
connect their various ministries, which has been implemented across
corporate America at a feverish pace.
</P>
<P>
   And several computer schools have been opened in Port-au-Prince,
teaching crowded classrooms everything from Lotus to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly people are starting to understand that the computer is
the way of the future and that they will be left behind if they
don't know technology,'' said Michelle Karshan, a spokeswoman for
Haitian President Rene Preval.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, widespread use of the Internet has been
hampered by the phone service provided by Teleco, Haiti's aging
monopoly, which is so poor that there are fewer than 80,000 phone
lines to serve 8 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the more than 100,000 people currently waiting for phone
service have been waiting for years.
</P>
<P>
   And those lucky enough to already have phone service may lose
their line for months after a big rain.
</P>
<P>
   Service costs $10 a month in a nation where the average
per-capita income is $250.
</P>
<P>
   Under the country's economic reform program, Teleco is supposed
to pass to private hands.
</P>
<P>
   But all such deals need the prime minster's signature and the
former prime minister, Rosny Smarth, resigned in June 1997 and has
yet to be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a political impasse that's going to continue to hold
up investment and privatization,'' said Ernest Preeg, U.S.
ambassador to Haiti from 1981 to 1983.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't stopped Computer World, which avoids Teleco's
ground-based phone lines by using a router that picks up satellite
signals to make connections.
</P>
<P>
   Computer World also uses a generator and battery-powered
inverter to avoid the common power outages plaguing the country.
</P>
<P>
   All of this has contributed to the cyber-cafe's rising
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   At Computer World, Guillaume has sold memberships to more than
120 people for about $35 a month, for which they receive an e-mail
address and mailbox, plus 20 hours of Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Non-members can access the Internet for about $5 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   He also offers six-week training classes, at a cost of about
$300, for Internet novices.
</P>
<P>
   And there are plenty of them.
</P>
<P>
   Even many professionals here, such as doctors, lawyers, and
engineers, know almost nothing about surfing the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have people come in from the university asking me what the
Internet is and about how to use it, and I'm happy to be able to
teach them,'' Guillaume said.
</P>
<P>
   That's good news for people like Ida Morel, a nurse's aide eager
to learn how to use computers to do medical research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computers are not something we grow up with here, so having
Computer World is great,'' she said. ``I can come in, experiment
with computers, ask questions and get all the help I need.''

`X-FILES' MOVIE IS A PREREQUISITE FOR NEW SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ If you still haven't seen the ``X-Files'' movie,
run out and rent it before Sunday's season premiere of the
television program on Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, you'll be lost. Well, more lost than usual with this
show.
</P>
<P>
   It is a strange role reversal for a strange drama: You need not
be a fan of the television show to follow the movie. But you better
have seen the movie if you want to follow the program.
</P>
<P>
   Now remember that ``X-Files'' fans like to be jerked around by
creator Chris Carter, who delights in taking plotlines and episodes
down dead ends, and twisting facts into false leads and paranoia.
This show has more conspiracies than 10 years of talk radio.
</P>
<P>
   While there is some competition out there on television's
conspiracy front _ the Carter-created ``Millennium'' on Fox and
NBC's ``The Pretender'' come to mind _ none come close to mixing
the supernatural with science fiction with the plain spookiness of
``The X-Files.'' Maybe you would have to go back to the 1960s, with
shows like ``The Outer Limits,'' ``Twilight Zone'' and ``The
Prisoner,'' to find TV dramas that can mess with your mind like
this.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest premiere of the television season, ``The X-Files''
begins its sixth season _ and its first to film in Los Angeles
instead of Vancouver, British Columbia _ on Sunday at 9 p.m. EDT.
The episode ties together some of the loose ends not only from last
season, but also from the feature film that starred series' leads
David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson and the rest of the regulars,
from Cigarette Man to Agent Skinner and the Lone Gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is a good movie and a very good episode, with wilder
action scenes and better special effects than the TV series _ and
that oh-so-close kiss.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday the partnership of Scully and Mulder _ and their
X-Files unit at the FBI _ remain in jeopardy, even after Mulder
treks to Antarctica, saves Scully, uncovers more layers of the
government conspiracy, sees aliens and their ship ... and, of
course, can't prove a thing.
</P>
<P>
   In a particularly gory season opener, which not only picks up on
the movie but also last season's finale (titled ``The End''),
Mulder and Scully defy superiors as they try to track down a
12-year-old with special mental powers who may be able to unlock
the conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are those pesky alien breeds who tend to pop
out of people's chests and guts, and the Elders who may or may not
be selling out the world, and the two new agents, one an old Mulder
love interest who may or may not be trying to help him, and ...
</P>
<P>
   What, you want all this explained?
</P>
<P>
   As good as the first episode is, the third (Nov. 22, 9 p.m.) is
even better. It may not be the best ``X-Files'' ever, but it is
certainly the most amusing and different _ which is saying
something for this show.
</P>
<P>
   Shot in letterbox format (the black borders you see in some
movies), the episode titled ``Triangle'' feels more like a flick
than a show _ and is much brighter than the usual
flashlight-beam-through-the-dark-shadows look of most episodes.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Anderson and Duchovny kiss _ sort of. Don't freak,
fans, it's not the end of the show.
</P>
<P>
   But the end could be near. This could be the last season for
Anderson and Duchovny _ both have sights on movie careers _ but not
necessarily ``The X-Files.'' And the two stars leaving the series
may not mean the end of Scully and Mulder.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said it's premature to talk about introducing new
characters to replace Scully and Mulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even want to think about it until the time comes to
think about it,'' he said a few months back.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said more ``X-Files'' movies could be in the offing,
especially if 20th Century Fox gets its way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess they're serious about it,'' Carter said. ``It's just
something to think about and to consider.''
</P>
<P>
   Or not. Maybe.

<P>
   Perilously, the fate of Russia now rests on the shoulders of its
increasingly fragile president and fragmented coalition government,
out of the West's control.
</P>
<P>
   Critics charge that the IMF's loans to Russia were imprudent and
wasteful.
</P>
<P>
   But the IMF failed to stem the Russian collapse not because its
reform package was flawed but because Russia's domestic woes _
combined with its sensitivity to the global slump in oil and
commodity prices _ were too severe to prevent market panic.
</P>
<P>
   Had the $22 billion IMF package for Russia been as large as its
$40 billion bailout of Mexico in 1995, investors would probably not
have fled. Instead, Russia's fiscal position was so delicate that
investors decided $22 billion was not enough to guarantee success.
</P>
<P>
   During the early stages of the global financial contagion that
began with the devaluation of the Thai baht in July 1997, Russia
escaped a ruble devaluation thanks to previously pledged IMF
support and investor demand for high-yield Russian Treasury bonds.
But when the IMF failed to help sustain the ruble in the spring and
early summer as it came under pressure from Russia's large budget
deficit and first postcommunist trade deficit, investors panicked.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting capital flight out of Russia and other emerging
markets produced a $2 trillion to $3 trillion decline in the value
of global stock-market capitalization and caused a correction in
American fixed-income instruments and corporate bond markets so
large that even sophisticated hedge funds like Long Term Capital
were eventually hit.
</P>
<P>
   With the Russian crisis threatening to spiral out of control,
the IMF assembled a $22 billion package for Russia in July, over
the objections of many of its own officials. The United States had
to lobby the IMF to relax its conditions for lending to Russia on
the grounds that Russia was ``too nuclear to go bust.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the IMF's announcement of the loan, however, events
turned against the fund. The communist-dominated Duma refused to
pass measures essential for reform, such as tax increases. In
addition, the price of oil continued to slide as OPEC members
failed to cap crude production, while the ongoing turmoil in Asia
depressed commodity prices further and increased investor
skittishness over emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   New York hedge funds and Russian banks took advantage of the new
IMF loan to withdraw from the market and take their dollars
offshore. In the end, the IMF program failed to rescue the ruble
and prevent a government default because investors decided that
Russia was too expensive to save.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's reformers might have been able to lay the groundwork
for a more sound market economy, however, if the IMF had offered a
package the size of its 1995 Mexico proposal. The Russian economy
had begun to pick up, and direct foreign investment was poised to
expand before the collapse in oil and commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
   A sustained upturn would have reduced the government deficit and
increased public support for reform while supporting the ruble. But
since the IMF package failed, Russia is now headed for
hyperinflation and an economic collapse so severe that it threatens
Russia's fledgling democracy. The events unfolding in Russia
profoundly shock the Russian people, deal a blow to the reformers
in other former Soviet republics, and crush investor confidence in
all countries on its periphery.
</P>
<P>
   Russia still deserves Western assistance as a defeated but
potentially dangerous nuclear power. The West, however, has yet to
create an effective framework to aid a country whose political
institutions are still reeling from 70 years of command economy
mismanagement and a corrupt redistribution of state assets after
communism's collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Tragically, the reformers who dominated the government in July
did not have enough time to establish market credibility and
challenge the iron grip of Russia's business oligarchs before the
slump in oil and commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a new team has taken over that is deeply divided
over policy and liable to print money to finance the budget. The
resulting hyperinflation could either set the stage for the
reformers to return or spark a nationalist backlash.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the magnitude of the global market collapse after
the Russian default illustrated how badly the market had misjudged
Russian credit and the capacity of the IMF and the U.S. Treasury to
intervene effectively. Their inability to save Russia demonstrated
the limits of their power and caused investors to reassess risk all
around the world. Countries such as Brazil and Venezuela had to
hike interest rates immediately to discount the risk of immediate
default.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting rise in borrowing costs was so severe that a Latin
American recession will be unavoidable in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF's critics, including Republican members of Congress,
charge that its only mission is to rescue bankers from their own
foolishness and encourage reckless lending to countries undeserving
of international support. Other commentators lambaste the IMF's
assistance to countries under authoritarian regimes, such as
Suharto's Indonesia, and see IMF funds as nothing more than
financial aid for dictators.
</P>
<P>
   But these critics fail to grasp the larger historical
implications.
</P>
<P>
   If Russia does revert back to authoritarian rule and a command
economy, historians will say that the West lost Russia because it
was not prepared to spend enough to ensure its successful
transition into a market economy. The United States stands right in
the middle of this debate, having used the IMF since the Cold War
as a proxy agency for American foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Whether with Mexico in 1995 or Asia in 1997, the United States
has decisively shaped the IMF agenda, calling for the
liberalization of trade and investment in countries that would
otherwise resist implementation of these policies through bilateral
channels.
</P>
<P>
   As Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said in February,
``The IMF has done more to promote America's trade and investment
agenda in Korea than 30 years of bilateral trade talks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has asked Congress to provide more
than $18 billion in new IMF funding to help expand its total
capital to $280 billion, but the House continues to refuse. If
America fails to provide its share, the IMF will have to find other
means of funding, such as borrowing in commercial paper and bond
markets or greater contributions from other members, that would
inevitably reduce U.S. influence.
</P>
<P>
   Last autumn Japan proposed creating an Asian monetary fund to
bolster the resources available to the region's troubled countries.
The U.S. Treasury rejected that idea because it feared it would
establish an institution that could compete with the IMF _ and thus
weaken American control. Congress must decide whether America wants
to pay the cost of leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Great economic crises do not occur in political vacuums. In the
1930s, depression led to global war and cost millions of lives.
</P>
<P>
   In Indonesia today, the streets of Jakarta have already seen
bloodshed and attacks on ethnic Chinese. While China has mostly
stayed aloof so far, it has formally indicated its concern to the
Indonesian government.
</P>
<P>
   If civil war were to break out in Indonesia, it would disrupt 40
percent of the globe's shipping _ including energy supplies for
Japan and electronic goods for the world _ that passes through its
waters. The economic crisis may strengthen the hand of extremist
Islamic parties and pose new foreign policy problems for the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The great difference between today's economy and the emergence
of the modern market economy a century ago is the speed and
frequency with which money moves across borders. As the shocks
following the Russian default have shown, economists still cannot
fully comprehend the consequences of a global financial system that
can move capital so quickly and cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF has evolved into an institution that assumes some basic
functions of a global central bank without provoking needless
debate about whether the world needs a global currency or political
union. It still has much to learn from the revolution in technology
and financial behavior in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1998, the IMF remains the best solution in an imperfect
world. If the IMF did not exist, governments would be frantically
debating today whether to establish such an organization.

financial aid for dictators.
</P>
<P>
   But these critics fail to grasp the larger historical
implications.
</P>
<P>
   If Russia does revert back to authoritarian rule and a command
economy, historians will say that the West lost Russia because it
was not prepared to spend enough to ensure its successful
transition into a market economy. The United States stands right in
the middle of this debate, having used the IMF since the Cold War
as a proxy agency for American foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Whether with Mexico in 1995 or Asia in 1997, the United States
has decisively shaped the IMF agenda, calling for the
liberalization of trade and investment in countries that would
otherwise resist implementation of these policies through bilateral
channels.
</P>
<P>
   As Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said in February,
``The IMF has done more to promote America's trade and investment
agenda in Korea than 30 years of bilateral trade talks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has asked Congress to provide more
than $18 billion in new IMF funding to help expand its total
capital to $280 billion, but the House continues to refuse. If
America fails to provide its share, the IMF will have to find other
means of funding, such as borrowing in commercial paper and bond
markets or greater contributions from other members, that would
inevitably reduce U.S. influence.
</P>
<P>
   Last autumn Japan proposed creating an Asian monetary fund to
bolster the resources available to the region's troubled countries.
The U.S. Treasury rejected that idea because it feared it would
establish an institution that could compete with the IMF _ and thus
weaken American control. Congress must decide whether America wants
to pay the cost of leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Great economic crises do not occur in political vacuums. In the
1930s, depression led to global war and cost millions of lives.
</P>
<P>
   In Indonesia today, the streets of Jakarta have already seen
bloodshed and attacks on ethnic Chinese. While China has mostly
stayed aloof so far, it has formally indicated its concern to the
Indonesian government.
</P>
<P>
   If civil war were to break out in Indonesia, it would disrupt 40
percent of the globe's shipping _ including energy supplies for
Japan and electronic goods for the world _ that passes through its
waters. The economic crisis may strengthen the hand of extremist
Islamic parties and pose new foreign policy problems for the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The great difference between today's economy and the emergence
of the modern market economy a century ago is the speed and
frequency with which money moves across borders. As the shocks
following the Russian default have shown, economists still cannot
fully comprehend the consequences of a global financial system that
can move capital so quickly and cheaply.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF has evolved into an institution that assumes some basic
functions of a global central bank without provoking needless
debate about whether the world needs a global currency or political
union. It still has much to learn from the revolution in technology
and financial behavior in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1998, the IMF remains the best solution in an imperfect
world. If the IMF did not exist, governments would be frantically
debating today whether to establish such an organization.

<P>
   The recent, brutal civil wars in Cambodia, Bosnia, Rwanda and
the Congo make plain the need to prosecute amoral leaders who show
no care for civilian lives.
</P>
<P>
   At least, this seemed to be America's position for the last four
years as Bill Clinton and Madeleine Albright touted the
establishment of the International Criminal Court as a key
foreign-policy aim.
</P>
<P>
   And yet in July 1998, when the draft treaty to create the ICC
was approved in Rome, the United States found itself in a nasty
minority, siding with Libya, Iraq, Yemen and Qatar against the
court. (The final vote was 120 in favor, 7 opposed and 21
abstentions.)
</P>
<P>
   Some of Washington's concerns were serious and legitimate.
American troops are deployed across the globe, and should not be
put in a position of having to face the added danger of politically
motivated prosecutions. But more broadly, the administration failed
to think through or effectively articulate its position.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the negotiations, wary of a skeptical Congress, the
White House dithered. Though international meetings on the ICC
began in 1994, the United States failed to decide key issues _
would it back the court? under what terms? _ until the president's
return from China in early July.
</P>
<P>
   Only then, four weeks into the five-week U.N. final conference,
were cabinet debates resolved and instructions issued to the
American negotiating team. But by then it was too late to convince
frustrated allies to accommodate new U.S. demands _ a case study in
how not to conduct multilateral diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   True, the evaluation of the court's ultimate potential (and
whether America should join), as well as the court's future, will
hinge on the sound choice of a prosecutor and judges, and the
enunciation of prosecutorial priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Yet an historic opportunity to shape the court in America's
image was lost. What we got instead was a court America cannot
agree to _ at least not until its good faith has been tested over
years.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the Rome conference was inauspicious for the
United States. After triumph at the Ottawa land-mines conference _
where they brushed aside U.S. military needs in Korea _ a caucus of
so-called like-minded states, under Canadian and Norwegian
leadership, demanded an unfettered court. Thus the unity of
traditional NATO allies was pried apart.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the European Union had also hailed an independent
court as the hallmark of its post-Bosnia try for a unified foreign
and security policy. The Germans, French and even the British
(citing the ``ethical dimension'' of Tony Blair's foreign policy)
went to Rome ready to abandon America in their race for European
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   In its fateful decision to vote against the treaty, the United
States complained of having been rebuffed on two issues. Yet these
issues were, in fact, red herrings, since they added little to the
risks the Americans were already willing to accept.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. negotiators made no objection to the complaint system that
allows any state party, friend or foe, to refer investigations to
the court without Security Council approval. Yet Washington
vehemently opposed an independent prosecutor out of fear he might
start investigations on his own motion, subject only to court
approval.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the American team pushed to broaden the treaty's
probationary period. The Rome conference established that for the
first seven years, states need only accept the court's power over
genocide and crimes against humanity (though at the end, countries
must accept war-crimes coverage as well or quit the treaty). The
United States argued for a 10-year probationary period and to
exclude coverage of crimes against humanity during that time.
</P>
<P>
   But this would not have eliminated the risks to American troops.
A rogue state bent on harrying Americans will use any available
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the treaty's protections, it is possible that hostile
states will file complaints against American troops and civilian
leaders to settle political scores. U.S. military decisions _ in
peacekeeping, antiterrorist enforcement, freedom-of-navigation
exercises and strategic deterrence _ will be scrutinized by those
hoping to show that an American use of force was disproportionate
or improper (and thus criminal).
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the ICC treaty bars formal amendments for the
first seven years and forbids individual reservations (opt-outs by
countries). And the prospect of early alterations is unlikely,
given the hostility that lingers toward the United States, in
countries that made hard concessions at Rome only then to see
America reject the entire treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, has declared war on the ICC for not giving ``100 percent
protection'' from prosecution to American GIs. Indeed, exposure of
U.S. troops and commanders to judgment by an international court
free to decide for itself what is a ``disproportionate'' use of
force (and hence a war crime) should concern Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But Helms must be persuaded that flaws in Rome can be
constructively addressed, protecting American interests without
abandoning America's leadership role. The power and prestige of the
United States would be enhanced if it helped improve the ICC,
rather than retreating in dismay. A preparatory session, already
scheduled for next year to hammer out rules of evidence and
procedure, might be a good place to start addressing American
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Effective authority in international politics requires power as
well as legitimacy. The international tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia has found that its orders are paid little heed unless
the United States and its allies lend their diplomatic, economic
and military muscle.
</P>
<P>
   In order to secure defendants, evidence and funding, the new
court must rely on the goodwill of many states _ but foremost among
them, the world's one remaining superpower. Unless it acts
scrupulously, the court will never win financial backing. The ad
hoc tribunal for the former Yugoslavia runs an annual budget of $70
million, while its counterpart for Rwanda struggles by with $40
million.
</P>
<P>
   Many states hope that the United Nations will fund the new court
in its first years of operation. But this again devolves to the
United States, as the deep pocket that supplies a quarter of the
world body's budget (if and when it pays its dues). While other
states will resist explicit American conditions on tribunal funding
(thanks to the ongoing U.N. dues battle), they must recognize that
the United States will never bankroll an abusive court.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military role in international security will not be
altered by the evangelism of an international court. After all, the
court was set up to address the horrors of contemporary civil wars,
not cut down America's preeminence in the post-Cold War world.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, though, the United States should learn some long-range
lessons from its missteps at Rome. For one, Americans must realize
that their allies no longer view them as indispensable, and that if
America stonewalls, it may get left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiating vital matters should not be left to the last minute,
to the chaos of open conferences and the mystery of working groups
from which Americans may be excluded. This includes raising issues
well in advance through NATO and other alliance channels, and
through quiet contacts in national capitals at a political level
where flexibility remains possible.
</P>
<P>
   And Rome should teach American diplomats not to start listening
to Capitol Hill so late in the game, once thoughts turn to
ratification, but to take Congress seriously and heed its warnings
early on, at the start of the negotiation process.
</P>
<P>
   America will get other chances to lead the battle against war
crimes. But foresighted diplomacy, not always shown in preparation
for Rome, will be required.
</P>
<P>
   When the opportunity for action arises, the United States should
have its mind already made up, so it may lead future negotiations
and not just lamely follow them.

FORGET Y2K, THE REAL PROBLEM IS RIGHT NOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``If you don't have something nice to say, don't say anything at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   How many times were you told that as a child? I heard it all the
time.
</P>
<P>
   That mandate usually resulted in a prolonged period of silence
as I struggled to control my anger or frustration. It's an old
cliche, but it is also a building block for constructing the art of
diplomacy, the portrait of peace.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Carlson, PhD., author of the national bestseller ``Don't
Sweat The Small Stuff ... and It's All Small Stuff,'' says that you
should always breathe before you speak. Those two or three seconds
of inhaling and exhaling give you time to think about your response
before you overreact. That's all a lot easier said than done isn't
it?
</P>
<P>
   Can you even imagine a world where no one says mean, bigoted,
cruel, hate-filled words? It would certainly be unlike this place
we call home. Imagine watching the evening news and seeing
protesters who succinctly state their differences of opinion
without personally attacking anyone. Imagine campaign races without
mud slinging. Imagine every talk show being as positive and upbeat
as Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood. Imagine record stores without parental
advisories on any of the CDs. It would be a world with fewer people
whining and complaining and more people doing their part, however
small, to fix what is broken.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's the world John Lennon envisioned when he wrote,
``Imagine all the people living life in peace; Imagine all the
people sharing all the world.''
</P>
<P>
   No abuse. No screaming. Maybe even no wars or bombs killing
innocent people. No hatred? Maybe John Glenn can see a world like
that in outer space, but it's real hard to do from here. I suppose
that's why Lennon went on to say, ``You may say that I'm a dreamer,
but I'm not the only one. Maybe someday you will join us and the
world will be as one.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone is worried about the Y2K problem, the computer crisis
of the new millennium. But we have even more pressing issues to
address. Just listen to our children in their like-new, teen-age,
cynical bodies. Listen to the people around you. Hear the anger.
Hear their emotional pots boil as their lids prepare to blow.
Listen to your heart. Does it growl? Does it purr? Does it speak?
Are you sure?
</P>
<P>
   We don't have a year 2000 problem, we have a right now, right
here, 1998 problem. It's not a dream. Could this be the
disintegration of our moral constitutions? All truths are not
self-evident.
</P>
<P>
   We can a take deep breath before we speak.
</P>
<P>
   But what will we do about it after we exhale?
</P>
<P>
   Houston, we have a problem.
</P>

LITERARY LEGEND TOM WOLFE OUTDOES EVEN HIMSELF IN HIS LATEST EPIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Often, when a famous writer emerges after years in seclusion
writing what is advertised as his or her greatest book, the result
is anything but that.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Mailer and ``Ancient Evenings'' come to mind. Seymour
Hersch's reputation will probably never recover after the debacle
titled ``The Dark Side of Camelot.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when the heralded work is as wonderful as advertised, there
is no guarantee anyone will appreciate it. Joseph Heller took 13
years after ``Catch-22'' to produce ``Something Happened,'' which
remains one of the 20th century's fictional masterworks. But
everyone had expected ``Catch-22 II,'' so most of the world yawned.
</P>
<P>
   But with the much-anticipated, much-hyped ``A Man in Full,'' Tom
Wolfe has pulled it off.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Wolfe surprised the literary world with ``The Bonfire
of the Vanities,'' a wickedly skillful skewering of '80s yuppiedom
greed. It was Wolfe's first novel after a half-dozen nonfiction
outings that had established him as the master of that difficult
genre. He'd received considerable acclaim for ``The Electric
Kool-Aid Acid Test'' and ``Radical Chic.'' In 1980, ``The Right
Stuff,'' Wolfe's addictively readable study of the early U.S. space
program, garnered him the prestigious National Book Award for
nonfiction. His fans were amazed to learn through ``Bonfire'' that
he was just as adept at socially conscious fiction.
</P>
<P>
   And then, for 11 years, Wolfe was absent from the bookstore
wars. Reports were that he was hard at work on novel No. 2, a
sprawling story intended to capture the world-weary social
economics of the '90s as effectively as he'd frozen the heedless
rich folks of the '80s. Longtime Wolfe publisher Farrar, Straus and
Giroux, FSG in publishing world shorthand, periodically trumpeted
the impending appearance of the author's absolute best effort yet.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, ``A Man in Full'' (FSG, $28.95) will finally appear
on bookstore shelves, and even Wolfe's staunchest fans will have to
admit he's taken his wordy art to a new, higher level. Lengthy at
742 pages but without even a paragraph seeming turgid, exemplary
for eagle-eyed social commentary as well as intricate crafting of
words, the book is everything its publisher promised.
</P>
<P>
   The book's plot centers on Charlie Croker, a 60-year-old Atlanta
wheeler-dealer whose sprawling business empire is crumbling
financially at the same incredible rate that his right knee,
injured while playing college football, is disintegrating. Charlie
wants desperately to salvage his pride, reputation and beloved
restored plantation from the money pit he's dug. Any number of
enemies, from creditors to an ex-wife, have the opposite intention.
As with ``Bonfire,'' Wolfe weaves in numerous subplots that
eventually collide. Every character is created for a purpose; every
word of every conversation is relevant. To read this book is to be
amazed in the most positive of ways.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, ``A Man in Full'' does for Atlanta what
``Bonfire'' did for New York City. The town's social warts are
exposed. Lingering Southern racism is rampant. Wolfe never resorts
to heavy-handed condemnation of Atlanta societal customs he
obviously abhors. Instead, he gives us an eclectic cast of
characters who can show us attitudes and events from a variety of
angles, until readers have no doubts that what they're reading is
both socially awful and socially true. Here's a safe prediction: If
any critics pan the book, they'll either be working for an Atlanta
publication or living there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonfire'' unfortunately became a terrible movie. Two or three
years from now, it is inevitable that a celluloid version of ``A
Man in Full'' will hit the screen. But in the meantime, Tom Wolfe
and ``A Man in Full'' will remain constantly in front of us. It is
possible that no book has received so much pre-publication
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   As with ``Bonfire,'' Wolfe and FSG chose to tease the reading
public by placing excerpts of ``A Man in Full'' in Rolling Stone
magazine months before the book's release date. Rolling Stone made
potential book-buyers drool at the thought of the impending Wolfe
publication; Wolfe and FSG were careful to note that the excerpts
represented a work still in progress, which gave the author leeway
to rewrite anything critics panned.
</P>
<P>
   FSG ordered a 1.2 million-copy first printing, which is unheard
of for so-called serious fiction. Genre fluff like Stephen King
bloodfests might get similar orders, but Toni Morrison and Cormac
McCarthy and their gifted ilk usually must settle for first
printings of 100,000-250,000. (Any novel that sells 75,000 copies
will probably spend at least a few weeks on most bestseller lists).
</P>
<P>
   To sell those 1.2 million copies, FSG undertook a ferocious,
intelligent marketing campaign. Advance copies were placed in the
most advantageous hands; last week, Time magazine chose Wolfe and
``A Man in Full'' over the history-making Mideast peace
negotiations for its cover story. Wolfe has been made available for
interview by other publications judged either as prestigious or
massively popular. Critics had no choice other than to notice: ``A
Man in Full'' was named a finalist for the National Book Award for
fiction a month before its originally scheduled Nov. 12 publication
date.
</P>
<P>
   As yet, no national book tour has been announced to give
rank-and-file fans a chance to line up at Borders or Barnes &AMP; Noble
for Wolfe's autograph, but that will undoubtedly come if FSG
decides it is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   It probably won't be. Based on pre-publication publicity alone,
``A Man in Full'' is already No. 2 on Internet bookstore
Amazon.com's hot-seller list (trailing only Chris Bohjalian's
``Midwives,'' Oprah Winfrey's latest Book Club selection).
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe himself soon faces his 70th birthday and the challenge of
topping ``A Man in Full.'' Writers of lesser talent or ego might
shrink from that, resorting to shortish first-person essays or a
U-turn back to book-length nonfiction. Wolfe, still elegant in his
white suits, promises another novel, one to be delivered sooner
than 11 years from now.
</P>
<P>
   Can he improve on ``A Man in Full''? Well, it would have seemed
impossible to do better than ``The Bonfire of the Vanities.''
Meanwhile, Wolfe can enjoy this: Based on his previous body of work
as well as ``A Man in Full,'' it seems unavoidable for literary
critics to properly anoint him. With apologies to Morrison,
McCarthy, Heller, Paul Auster, Larry McMurtry, Pam Houston, and all
other sublimely talented U.S. writers well- or little-known, Tom
Wolfe has established himself as the finest American author of this
generation. Critics of the 21st century may well decide only Mark
Twain stands with Wolfe as a deadeye chronicler of who we have
been, and why.

FOR CONGRESS, SOCIAL SECURITY TOPS THE AGENDA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and p coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One of the top issues facing the newly elected
106th Congress, which convenes in January, will be how to preserve
the long-term stability of the Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties delayed the potentially fractious debate to avoid
fallout in Tuesday's mid-term elections. They wasted no time
squabbling Wednesday over who best could protect the public
retirement program, although neither party had yet to propose a
formal plan.
</P>
<P>
   The debate, with potential ramifications for nearly all
Americans, will compete for public attention with several other
issues that were considered in the current legislative session.
Several of the issues were not resolved, and others were killed by
the Republican majority or dropped amid the threat of a
presidential veto.
</P>
<P>
   Notable among the lingering issues are competing plans to
regulate managed health care programs. Lawmakers could not
reconcile their differences over the proposals this year, and it
remains to be seen whether the new Congress, which closely
resembles the current edition, will be more successful.
</P>
<P>
   How to allocate a rapidly expanding budget surplus will also
draw attention, with many Republicans pushing for tax cuts and
Clinton advocating saving much of the extra money until the Social
Security system is fixed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there is likely to be renewed debate over how to
improve public education, ensure the nation's military strength,
and protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of banning late-term abortions are expected to raise
the issue again, after Clinton vetoed a bill that passed the
current Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Also, supporters of a plan to overhaul the campaign finance
system are expected to try again after failing repeatedly in the
current session.

FLOPPIES STILL RULE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Tuesday's elections proved, there's a lot to be said for
incumbency. It takes an extraordinary effort to dislodge the guy
who got there first, and most haven't got what it takes.
</P>
<P>
   Same thing in the tech trade, though around here we have a
suitably clunky term for it. We call it ``the first-mover
advantage.'' Win this bit of technological high ground and you'll
probably stay there for quite awhile.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the lowly floppy disk drive, the one you use for
carrying word-processor files around in your purse or pocket. It's
about the most primitive piece of technology you'll find in the
average computer. Its sheer crudity so offended Apple Computer Inc.
boss Steve Jobs that he banned the floppy drive from the new iMac.
Instead, he declared, iMac users would buy advanced drives with
removable high-capacity cartridges _ drives like the Iomega Zip,
the Imation SuperDisk or the SyQuest Sparq.
</P>
<P>
   Well, perhaps not the Sparq. Syquest shut its doors last week,
citing massive losses. The company may be resurrected after a bout
of Chapter 11 therapy, but then again maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the other floppy-drive wannabes aren't long for this
world. Iomega's Zip is far and away the most successful, with 14
million sold, yet the company has lost money the past two quarters.
Imation's SuperDisk has managed to move just four million drives,
even though SuperDisk is more versatile than Zip _ it accepts
standard floppies and 120-megabyte high-capacity disks. By year's
end, Sony Electronics, the firm that invented today's floppies,
will offer a 200-megabyte drive that also works with regular
floppies.
</P>
<P>
   I figure Iomega's bound to survive, given its existing customer
base. But either the Imation or Sony offerings probably won't be
around next year. The market's just not big enough. According to
Disk/Trend Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., Iomega and its rivals
sold only 8 million drives between them in 1997, and will probably
sell only 14 million this year. For Iomega to get back in the
black, it'll have to get a large share of this small market,
leaving very little for the other guys.
</P>
<P>
   In a sane world, the market for Zip and its rivals would be much
larger. Computer retailers ought to be nudging every home computer
buyer to buy one of these drives as a quick and handy way to back
up important data. A high-capacity removable disk is the simplest
way to avoid disaster. By not pushing them, computer dealers keep
blowing an opportunity to provide better service to their customers
and make more money for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the lowly 1.4-megabyte floppy soldiers on, a standard
feature in nearly every desktop and laptop computer. The industry
will buy 100 million of them this year, and while Disk/Trend
president James Porter expects sales to level off, they'll remain
popular well into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, they're everywhere. Steve Jobs may despise
floppies today, but he's the guy who introduced the current 3
1/2-inch standard disk to the world. The original Macintosh, back
in 1984, was the first machine to use them. Billions have been used
since.
</P>
<P>
   It costs a PC maker just $15 or so to install a floppy drive in
a machine, compared to about $40 for a Zip drive. And old floppy
disks cost about 50 cents apiece, compared to $10-$15 for a Zip
cartridge.
</P>
<P>
   And while the floppy can't handle hundreds of digital photos,
it'll easily hold hundreds of pages of text _ even more if you use
disk compression. Zip isn't only the name of a removable disk drive
_ it's also the name of the PC world's favorite disk compression
system. With the use of programs like Nico Mak Computing's WinZip
(http://www.winzip.com), floppies go a lot farther than you might
think.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent bout of housecleaning, I decided to back up a
16-megabyte file. WinZip made the file 75 percent smaller. Then it
let me do ``disk spanning,'' a handy feature that divides a single
large file into floppy-sized pieces, and then copies them onto the
disks. You just keep inserting floppies until the job is done. I
only needed four. There's no denying that floppy drives are
obsolete and destined to pass away. But Syquest's failure suggests
that a lot of newer and better technologies will beat floppies to
the graveyard.

BC'S HOVAN TRIES TO FORGET DEBACLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ No matter how much eye-black he smeared on his face, as
has been his practice before every game this season, there was no
masking the frustration Boston College junior nose guard Chris
Hovan experienced in the 35-17 loss to Miami on Halloween Night.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Hovan's name was nowhere to be found under the
``tackles'' category on the statistics sheet. It was the first time
this season the 6-foot-3-inch, 285-pounder failed to register a
tackle.
</P>
<P>
   But coach Tom O'Brien said there was an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ran a lot more wide on Saturday, which makes it tough for
him to get involved in the game,'' said O'Brien, who has
experimented this season by shifting Hovan from nose to tackle,
where he started as a freshman. ``Navy with the option offense,
they were double-teaming him all game long in the middle, and
that's why we tried to move him out a little wider to get him more
active. Miami used some of their speed to get on the perimeter on
us, and when they run the power inside, basically, they're
double-teaming him, so he draws a lot of attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Hovan, ``It's been like that the whole season, you know? A
lot of teams don't run up the middle anymore. They bring it outside
when teams don't run inside, and that's why it helps to have Brian
Maye and Frank Chamberlin out there, too. I found myself getting
double- and triple-teamed a lot, and it's kind of discouraging at
times, but I figure if two or three guys are on me, then someone
else is making plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Hovan no doubt will have to hold his ground as the focal point
of BC's defensive line when the Eagles (3-5) host No. 13 Notre Dame
(6-1) in their home finale Saturday at Alumni Stadium. The Eagles
will be looking to rebound from an 0-4 October by winning their
three November games. That's the only way they can salvage a
winning record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fact we want to go into November and go 3-0,
that's the main premise for this team so far,'' said Hovan. ``The
added incentive of playing Notre Dame doesn't hurt, either. But you
start off 3-0 and you start thinking about big things, and then the
five-game losing skid kind of puts a damper on it. It's just
another form of adversity the team has to face in November.''
</P>
<P>
   Another will be Notre Dame's offense, led by senior quarterback
Jarious Jackson and senior running back Autry Denson, who is 160
yards away from becoming the Irish's all-time leading rusher,
supplanting Allen Pinkett (4,131 yards, 1982-85).
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very versatile quarterback, more of a running
quarterback,'' Hovan said when asked if Jackson is comparable to
Syracuse's Donovan McNabb. ``He kind of resembles the guy from
Cincinnati last year (Chad Plummer). He's pretty versatile and he
can throw the ball and run the option, which I didn't know Notre
Dame was trying to get back to this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their offensive line is big and you have to give them some
props. But I think our defensive line is going to have to step up
and beat 'em out all day.''
</P>
<P>
   One foe who'll be a familiar face will be tight end Dan O'Leary,
Hovan's former high school teammate at Cleveland St. Ignatius.
``He's one of my best friends from high school,'' Hovan said.
``It's really weird because I haven't gone against him since like
high school in practice, and that's almost four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Dan's a heck of a player, and it'll be good to go against
him. We're friends and everything, but on the field, it's going to
be pure competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, one wonders if O'Leary will recognize Hovan with all his
war paint. When did Hovan start using his face as a canvas?
</P>
<P>
   ``Georgia Tech,'' he said, referring to the season opener. ``I
was sitting there putting on some eye-black and I knew my helmet
was going to hit me in the face a couple of times and smear it all
over, so a couple of guys said, `Why not just put a design to it?'
I get letters. Some people like it, some people don't. But it's
just me being me, I guess.''

DEVASTATED AGAIN, NICARAGUA FACES TOUGH ODDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   POSOLTEGA, Nicaragua _ Wrapped in plastic, the body of
11-year-old Isaias Vasquez Santeliz was buried in the moist ground
in a tiny cemetery Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On a humid, sun-baked afternoon, his gray wooden coffin was
carried on the back of a rusty flatbed truck. Teary women and
children sat in a ring around the box while the men walked slowly
along the side.
</P>
<P>
   What made the scene so special is that Isaias' death was marked
by a funeral.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the death and widespread destruction caused by
Hurricane Mitch, many of the 1,300 people claimed by a massive
mudslide five days ago are being placed into piles and cremated
quickly to prevent disease. The identities of the bodies, for the
most part, cannot be determined.
</P>
<P>
   What is certain, however, is that Nicaragua once again, after
encountering the mudslide and a smoldering volcano, will have to
face tough odds to rebuild itself from disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like God's anger came pouring down on us,'' said Lucia
Contreras of the mudslide, which buried her village of Rolando
Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounding towns such as Posoltega also were pounded by the
avalanche of mud and debris when the mountainside collapsed near
the Casitas volcano. To make matters worse, another volcano, Cerro
Negro, just southeast of Casitas, erupted Tuesday night, sending
plums of ash and lava down its sides.
</P>
<P>
   Seen from an airplane Wednesday, the area around Cerro Negro was
as dark as coffee grounds. In the distance the lush green hills of
Casitas were stained by the wide brown swath of mud that ran down
the mountain, split into two and carved deep rivers into the
villages below.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like it is one thing after another here,'' said
Gerardo Caceres, a restaurant owner in Chinendaga, one of the
hardest-hit areas. ``It's like we can't get a rest. People here are
very tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials say they haven't yet began to calculate the extent of
the damage. But they acknowledge that the level of destruction
across the country will be many times more than it what it cost to
rebuild after a 1972 earthquake killed nearly 10,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly, Nicaragua is the poorest Spanish-speaking country,''
said Mark Cackler, a Central American specialist for the World Bank
in Washington DC. ``This is a country that has taken more than its
share of big hits.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the earthquake, Nicaragua lost 15 percent of its
gross national product and about half of the total economic
activity of its capital, Managua, where the quake was centered.
Even today, along some of the cities major avenues, scars of that
disaster can still be seen. Many streets are riddled with holes
that some residents insist have been there decades. Many hi-rise
buildings damaged by the quake remain faded _ and untouched.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why all of us want to make sure that as Nicaragua
recovers, the whole country can move together,'' said Cackler.
``This is why all of us want to make sure that as Nicaragua
recovers, the whole country can move together.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1979 to 1990, the country was again ripped apart by a
violent civil war between leftist Sandinistas rebels and the right
wing governament. During those years, the country GDP per resident
fell 60 percent, according to World Bank figures. By the time the
war ended and the new president was elected, Nicaragua's economy
was in worse shape than had been following the earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Hurricane Mitch, the country's most promising areas
economically have been devastated. Large fields of grains and sugar
cane, which are used for domestic consumption, are now desolate
brown patches. And the country's increasingly successful farms,
where watermellons and onions were being grown for export, have
been wiped out.
</P>
<P>
   Before Isaias' casket was lowered, friends and and three
surviving aunts took one last look at the body.
</P>
<P>
   Of his seven-member family, only his 9-year-old brother, Isaac,
is still alive. Their parents, grandparents as well as several
aunts and cousins were all buried alive in the mudslide. Isaac
remains in a hospital in Chinendega.
</P>
<P>
   ``God said things like this would happen,'' said Candida Paulina
Morales Delgado, an aunt of the victim. ``Isaac is asking for his
family and we are telling him they are OK. We have to make sure he
is strong enough before we can tell him the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to lie to him but we have to watch out for Isaac,''
she said, ``because he is the only one left.''

BOSTON HEDGE FUNDS PRACTICE BALANCING ACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Long-Term Capital Management loses 90 percent of its
capital, triggering an extraordinary $3.6 billion bailout of the
hedge fund by some of Wall Street's biggest firms. Hedge fund
manager Julian Robertson's Tiger Management loses $2 billion in
single day last month. George Soros announces he is shuttering his
$1.5 billion emerging-market hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
   With hedge funds under fire, you'd think Boston's hedge fund
community would be sweating bullets. You'd be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Massively leveraged Long-Term Capital and other high-profile
hedge funds have been hammered by making huge bets on the direction
of interest rates or currencies. But Boston's hedge fund investors
are far more focused on traditional stock picking, looking for
stocks that are either undervalued or overvalued _ going ``long''
or ``short'' in the lexicon of the business. Leverage, the use of
debt to boost the money being bet, rarely approaches even two times
assets in these shops; Long-Term Capital leveraged its assets more
than 50 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Boston's conservative investing bias draws sneers from
some more aggressive investors, who suggest local hedge fund
managers have done a clever job getting clients to pay the outsize
fees that hedge funds command while taking remarkably little risk.
</P>
<P>
   The world of Boston hedge funds is, in short, considerably less
sexy and more boring than its counterparts in New York or London.
And boring, not sexy, is just where you want to be as a hedge fund
investor right now.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge funds are largely unregulated investment pools open to
only the wealthiest investors. Because of the risks, securities
laws require individual investors to have at least $200,000 in
income in each of the two most recent years or a net worth of $1
million. Hedge funds got their name because mangers typically
``hedged'' their investments, making offsetting bets protect
against big losses. But with the advent of the kind of
sophisticated computer-driven trading strategies used by Long-Term
Capital and others, the ``hedges'' are often abandoned in pursuit
of the big score.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's conservative approach could work to its advantage in
this time of great angst. The ugly blow-ups at Long-Term Capital
and elsewhere have caused a number of investors, including the
so-called funds of funds that represent billions of dollars in
assets, to give notice that they will be asking for their money
back at the end of the year, say those familiar with the moves.
</P>
<P>
   If that money does eventually move, where will it go? Some are
betting it will head back to the traditional long and short hedge
fund shops, places run by experienced managers such as Jeff Vinik,
Joe McNay, and James Pallotta at Boston's hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a flight to quality,'' says Charles Gradante, chief
investment strategist for Hennessee Group, a New York firm that
advises clients on hedge funds. ``Funds of funds are moving money
to managers that have a long track record and deeper experience.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of hedge fund managers say they are already hearing
from investors looking to move money. ``This is the best of
times,'' says Fred Kobrick, who with $100 million in hedge fund
money falls in the second-tier of Boston hedge managers. ``There is
so much bearishness and there is so much money coming out of the
loosey-goosey funds.''
</P>
<P>
   The hedge fund is a private world of investing, and few of those
who run it are anxious to talk about it. Cerulli Associates, a
Boston consulting firm, puts the number of domestic and offshore
hedge funds at more than 4,500, with nearly $300 billion under
management. While the giant funds run by the likes of Soros and
Robertson get all the press, the typical fund has less than $500
million and many have less than $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Ferri, who heads Matrix Partners, the highly successful
Waltham venture capital firm, says he invests in hedge funds for
one reason: to get the best managers and the best returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The smart guys know how to make the money,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Ferri was so enamored with hedge funds that he launched his own
in March. He and his friends put up $85 million, hoping to leverage
Matrix's insights into high-tech investing. Six months later he was
disappointed enough with the results to shut it down and return the
money to the investors. Instead, Ferri wrote a check in October to
get into Boston's newest hedge fund started by Jon Jacobson, the
star stock picker who recently left Harvard Management Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Boston is the center of the universe for mutual fund investing,
with more fund money under management than anywhere in the world.
But its hedge funds are nearly invisible and are dwarfed by giants
like Robertson and Soros, which each have an estimated $20 billion
under management. Taken together, Boston's nine managers have a
total of roughly $9 billion under management.
</P>
<P>
   Vinik, the former manager of Fidelity Investments' Magellan
fund, has quickly established himself as the king of the hill in
Boston. With an estimated $2 billion in assets under management,
Vinik would just qualify for the 10 largest hedge fund managers
compiled by MAR/Hedge, which tracks the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Among Boston's other biggest players: Jacobson, at $1.5 billion;
Pallotta, who manages $1.3 billion in equities from his Rowes Wharf
offices for New York-based Tudor Investments; Seth Klarman, who
runs $1 billion at Baupost Group in Harvard Square; and Wellington
Management and Oechsle International, which both have slightly less
than $1 billion each.
</P>
<P>
   If investors gravitate to the hedge funds for the returns, hedge
fund managers gravitate to the business for the payday. Hedge fund
managers typically receive 20 percent of profits and a 1 percent
management fee. For Vinik and his three partners that translated to
nearly $200 million in fees last year.
</P>
<P>
   No one is complaining about Vinik's fees _ not with his
performance. Vinik, as always, won't comment, but one investor said
Vinik returned a staggering 74 percent, after fees, last year. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, by comparison, was up 33 percent.
Vinik was up 22 percent, after fees, through September, compared
with 6 percent for the S&AMP;P, this investor said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson, on the other hand, has had a bumpier start.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike so-called market-neutral funds that try to minimize risk
by balancing their bets on stocks that they think will go up as
well as down _ long vs. short bets _ the highly concentrated
investments at Jacobson's Highfields Capital Management involve
potentially risky arbitrage plays in things like mergers or
convertible bonds. When the markets got whipsawed in August,
Jacobson lost about 10 percent of the $500 million he continued
managing for Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson won't comment, but his fund has reportedly recovered
somewhat in recent months. More than any single month of ups or
downs, his biggest problem may be the rising stock market: Most of
his $1.5 billion remains in cash while prices of stocks are going
up. It could take him months to get fully invested.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's relatively conservative hedge funds are a product of
the history of money management in the city. While New York's more
aggressive hedge funds grew out of that city's investment banks
such as Goldman Sachs and Salomon Bros., Boston has always been an
equity town, one dominated by its mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Boston hedge fund managers came from the funds.
Vinik and Larry Greenberg, now running the $400 million Mt. Everest
Fund in conjunction with Summit Partners, the Boston buyout firm,
both came from Fidelity. Walter Oechsle started his firm, focused
on international investing, when he and a group of money managers
walked out of Putnam Investments more than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a much more traditional stock picking city,'' says
Pallotta, who left his mentor, Joe McNay, and Essex Management in
1993 to run hedge money for Tudor Investments.
</P>
<P>
   That history has translated into a different culture for
Boston's hedge funds, say those who follow the industry. Lee
Hennessee, founder of the Hennessee Group, says that culture has
fostered greater disclosure and better client service. ``The
infrastructure is designed to tell a client about every stock they
own,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in the industry is anxious to distance themselves from
the debacle of Long-Term Capital. McNay, who has run hedge money in
Boston since the mid-'70s, isn't shy about his feelings about the
shoot-the-lights-out approach at Long-Term Capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was,'' says McNay, ``an example of greed with no thought of
risk.''

 Lowering cholesterol: A study's good news
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cholesterol-lowering drugs can do more, for more people, than
even boosters had believed, according to a study published
yesterday that involved more than 9,000 people with heart troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Previous studies have found that cholesterol-lowering drugs can
substantially reduce the risk of fatal heart attacks. This new one,
reported yesterday in the New England Journal of Medicine, adds
evidence that the drugs work not just on patients who have had
heart attacks, but also on those with unstable angina.
</P>
<P>
   The medication lowers the risk of death from heart disease as
well as other causes, and it works on patients with even lower
levels of cholesterol than were tested in the past, the study
found.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a surprising study but it is important. It's large,
it includes endpoints and entry criteria not included before ...
and it extends the group of patients you can achieve prevention
with,'' said Dr. Richard Pasternak, director of preventive
cardiology at Massachusetts General Hospital, who was not involved
with the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``If patients take these medicines for five or more years, you
will save a large number of lives and an even larger number of
cardiac procedures,'' added Pasternak, who said
cholesterol-lowering drugs could save 120,000 lives a year in the
United States alone.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Pasternak and the authors from Australia said, is
getting doctors to prescribe the medication and getting patients to
stay on it. Barely half the patients who meet guidelines for such
drugs have been prescribed them, and many stop taking the drugs due
to cost or inconvenience.
</P>
<P>
   The study was done by researchers at the University of Sydney as
part of a trial that began in 1989. It was supported by a grant
from Bristol-Myers Squibb, which manufactures the drug tested in
the study, Pravachol (pravastatin). Pasternak, however, said the
results should apply to a range of drugs that lower LDL, or ``bad''
cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Arsenic found to aid rare type of cancer
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arsenic is a poison.
</P>
<P>
   But now it turns out that the toxic metal can cure a rare form
of cancer, and that it may have a similar effect on other, more
common tumors.
</P>
<P>
   The finding, presented in the New England Journal of Medicine,
resulted from an experiment on 12 patients with acute promyelocytic
leukemia who had relapsed after extensive therapy, and for whom no
other treatment worked. They were given low doses of arsenic
trioxide. The result was that 11 of 12 had remission initially, and
that nine are alive a year after treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The cancer is virulent, and patients who relapse face such dim
prospects that the results with arsenic are ``just unheard of. We
never see a response rate this high,'' said Dr. Steven L. Soignet,
lead author of the study and an attending physician at the Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers were not totally surprised by arsenic's healing
power, since the poison has been used for medicinal purposes for
2,500 years and has been used to treat other leukemias for 60
years. They think it works on acute promyelocytic leukemia by
transforming cancer cells so that they become vulnerable to the
body's natural disease-fighting mechanisms. And they are encouraged
enough that comparable trials are underway nationwide, including
one that just began at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   What about using it on other cancers? ``Several studies are
investigating that,'' Soignet said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Birth weight linked to weight as an adult
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Logic says that overweight babies grow into overweight adults,
but researchers now believe the opposite often is the case.
</P>
<P>
   Babies who are undernourished in the womb often are fed too much
when they're too young to compensate, giving them excess fat to go
with diminished muscle mass. Other babies born small react by
storing more fat than their body needs as a reaction to their
having been undernourished in the womb.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that small babies often grow into obese adults who
are at risk of heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure,
say researchers who published their results in the November issue
of Pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   The solution? ``Parents should talk to their pediatrician about
an exercise program for the infants to increase blood flow and
muscle,'' said Mary L. Hediger, lead author of the study and a
researcher at the National Institute of Child Health and Human
Development. ``And parents should not overfeed small infants.''

PORTRAYALS OF ARABS IN FILM DIVIDE FILMMAKERS, ACTIVISTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Twentieth Century Fox knew it had the makings of a
minor jihad on its hands when the studio began running trailers for
its new terrorist thriller, ``The Siege,'' this summer and saw the
phone lines light up.
</P>
<P>
   The trailer's images _ New York City going boom juxtaposed with
Islamic believers praying in mosques _ didn't sit well with Muslim
and Arab-American groups who criticized Fox and director Ed Zwick
for perpetuating negative ethnic stereotypes. This was after the
organizations _ the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR)
and the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) _ read
the film's script in April and faxed a list of 60 objections to
Zwick and ``Siege'' producer Lynda Obst.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the filmmakers only made ``minor'' alterations, says
CAIR national communications director Ibrahim Hooper, leaving a
finished product that is ``extremely damaging and insensitive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The trailer is a work of sensitivity compared to the movie
itself,'' says Hooper, who saw ``The Siege'' twice in October.
``Negative stereotypes about Muslim characters are introduced and
continually reinforced. When people walk out of the theater, they
will think worse of Islam and Muslims than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   CAIR leaders plan to counteract that by distributing
informational leaflets outside theaters showing ``The Siege.'' The
group will also be sponsoring open houses at mosques in Santa
Barbara, Garden Grove, San Diego and Riverside in an effort to
expose people to Islamic beliefs and practices. (An open house at a
mosque in Hawthorne is also a possibility at press time.)
</P>
<P>
   For those involved with the film, the criticism feels like
``unfortunate political correctness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These days, there seems to be a sensitivity to any kind of
textured portrait,'' says Zwick, who also co-wrote the movie. ``I
suppose this is part of some kind of Islamic correctness, and I
won't be party to it. I'm sorry that people are offended, but I'm
not sorry for what the movie says. I think it's the most kind of
tolerant statement for the rights of this group that has ever been
made on behalf of their culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a sweeping statement would seem to be at odds with the bevy
of objections directed toward ``The Siege.'' But then Zwick, Obst
and screenwriters Lawrence Wright and Menno Meyjes appear to have
approached the film with good intentions only to see them (pardon
the expression) blow up in their faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Siege'' stars Denzel Washington as an FBI agent who teams
up with a CIA operative (Annette Bening) to investigate who is
behind a series of New York terrorist attacks. When the bombings
continue and the casualty rates escalate, the federal government
panics and invokes martial law. The U.S. Army, led by a no-nonsense
general (Bruce Willis) marches into Brooklyn, rounds up the usual
suspects (Arab-Americans) and herds them into makeshift internment
camps.
</P>
<P>
   The film prominently features an Islamic-American FBI agent,
played by Tony Shalhoub, who partners with Washington and objects
strenuously when the military's enforcement of martial law comes to
include his own family. The Shalhoub character is one of many
positive portrayals of Islamic culture in the movie, according to
Zwick.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of deeply sympathetic characters in this film,
and to say that they're all terrorists is a very narrow
representation of what we've done,'' says Zwick, a veteran
filmmaker whose credits include ``Glory,'' ``Courage Under Fire''
and the creation of such television series as ``thirtysomething''
and ``My So-Called Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Wright: ``I understand why these groups are upset.
Hollywood has scapegoated and stereotyped them in the past, and
it's shameful. But I think they've picked the wrong movie to use as
an example of what the movie business does wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Arab and Muslim rights groups don't see it that way. While
Hooper admits there are a few positive portrayals in the film, he
says they are negated by an overall impression that equates Islam
with violence. A particularly objectionable scene, he says, shows a
Muslim ceremonially washing his hands as he would do before prayer;
only here he follows the ritual by arming a bomb detonator.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an act performed by hundreds of millions of Muslims
all over the world,'' says ADC spokesman Hussein Ibish. ``To use it
as this symbol is extremely damaging and insensitive.''
</P>
<P>
   CAIR and the ADC also bemoan the lack of a clear distinction
between Arabs (anyone who speaks Arabic) and Muslims (those who
follow Islam) in the film. Most Arabs are Muslim, but the majority
of Muslims are not Arab but other nationalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average moviegoer is going to be completely confused,''
Ibish says.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Shalhoub character, well ... don't get Hooper
started.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's supposed to be this good Muslim, right?'' Hooper says.
``It's hard to see that. He swears more than any other person in
the film, he hits a prisoner, he plants money on a suspect and he
drinks, which is a most offensive thing to Islamic people. That
scene with him in the bar, getting tipsy ... why was it necessary?
Why couldn't he abstain? Why couldn't he be seen at some time, even
if only in the background, praying next to his desk at work? That
kind of behavior would lead to an (ITAL)accurate(ITAL OFF)
portrayal.''
</P>
<P>
   Responds producer Obst: ``These kinds of objections come with
the territory of making a movie. There have always been advocacy
groups. Italian-Americans complained about `The Godfather'; Jewish
groups didn't like `Bugsy.' We're still surprised, though. We
really thought we had been sensitive throughout the process.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time Arab and Islamic groups have
complained about negative stereotypes. When Disney released
``Aladdin'' on video, they cut portions of a song lyric and some
dialogue that groups had found offensive when the movie was
released in theaters. James Cameron's ``True Lies'' also came under
attack four years ago for its gun-wielding Arab terrorists who
shouted out religious prayers before firing their automatic
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But cartoon stereotypes are one thing. What disappoints many
Arab-Americans about ``The Siege'' is that they expected more,
inasmuch as it purported to be a serious film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other offensive movies were dumb, not to be taken seriously,''
Ibish says. ``This movie is nuanced. The fact it makes the case of
demonization more strongly in this sophisticated manner makes it
more dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Hooper: ``If it was just this movie, and there were other
positive portrayals, we could live with it. If you take 100 movies
with Irish-Americans or Italian-Americans, there will be some IRA
and some Mafia characters, but you'll have dozens of other positive
or neutral portrayals. Here, it's 100 out of 100. It's belly
dancers, bombers or billionaires. That's all you see.''
</P>
<P>
   Zwick strongly disagrees. He points to supporting characters in
``The Siege'' that include Arab-American community leaders, police
officers and business owners. He cites the film's message of
tolerance and inclusion. But in the end, he's tired of defending
the movie he spent two years writing and directing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it speaks for itself,'' Zwick says. ``You certainly
can't get around the fact that there are in this world violent,
radical Islamic fanatics. I didn't invent that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the movie also shows a vibrant, diverse Arab-American
culture. The objections seem to be a kind of orthodoxy, saying that
you can only describe a culture or religion in its most acceptable
terms. As a filmmaker, I find that unacceptable.''

AT 61, SURF ROCKER DICK DALE IS HIPPER THAN EVER 
</HEADLINE>
 DALE-MUSIC-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDY CORDOVA  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - You may not know the name. But odds are you've heard
Dick Dale play.
</P>
<P>
   Think back to the grinding, groovy guitar work that kept the
action pulsing in Quentin Tarantino's ``Pulp Fiction.'' That's
``Miserlou,'' a Dale anthem from 1962 and the song that helped
introduce the surf-guitar god to a new generation.
</P>
<P>
   Dale's cult success is proof that it's never too late to achieve
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   His legions of fans _ they call themselves ``Dick Heads'' _ go
not only to experience his spectacular moves on the guitar. They go
out of respect for the man known as the King of the Surf Guitar.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dale lore, he got his start playing on a ukulele
that he earned by selling jars of Noxema skin cream. The southpaw
taught himself to play the top country songs of the day. He still
has never had any formal training.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was Boston-born, the family moved to California. He
became a devoted surfer, and it seemed only natural he would
combine his two loves. He became known for his intense, possessed
performances that featured his adrenaline-pumping, sweeping style
that somehow captured the essence of an endless summer. He did some
vocal work, but his instrumentals were what captured the public's
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   His reverb-heavy recordings became in-demand items in Southern
California, without ever quite becoming true national hits. But he
did get national attention, including a spread in ``Life'' magazine
and a role in ``Beach Party,'' with the beauteous Annette Funicello
and Frankie Avalon.
</P>
<P>
   But after the Beatles and other Brits helped chase away the
sounds of a driving surf guitar, Dale retreated. He probably had
more important things on his mind: He successfully battled cancer
and became known as an ecological warrior, with strong views on
water pollution.
</P>
<P>
   The rebirth came through ``Back to the Beach,'' a 1987 Frankie
and Annette reunion that featured a sizzling version of
``Pipeline'' with Stevie Ray Vaughan, another Dale disciple. The
recording won a Grammy, Dale's first, and his profile began to rise
all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, this incarnation of Dale bears little resemblance to
the man from the '60s. The pompadour and surfer-boy good looks are
gone, replaced by a burly man who favors Indian-style clothing and
wears his hair in a ponytail. He's like the eccentric granddad you
always wanted and never had.
</P>
<P>
   That brings us up to date. After Tarantino used the
unforgettable ``Miserlou'' in ``Pulp Fiction,'' a stint on the
Warped Tour followed, where he played with alterna-kids who
probably wouldn't know Frankie from Fabian.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, there is no sign of Dale slowing down _ good news
for Dick Heads everywhere. He is still as kinetic and driven as
ever, the ``Sultan of Shred'' to the youngsters who now dominate
his audience. Well, maybe ``dominate'' is the wrong word, but they
are out there in force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get indie rockers, skinheads, motorcycle people, parents
with their 17-year-olds _ sure, they sit on different sides of the
room, but they're all screaming at Dick Dale tearing apart his
guitar,'' he said in a recent interview. ``When I go, it'll be up
there onstage . . . in an explosion of body parts.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, that seems fitting. &QL;

BUILDING A SUMMER HOUSE IN THE GRAND TRADITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rosemary and John Spillane have owned property on Great Island
in Yarmouth, Mass. for more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   After raising four sons and a daughter, they figured maybe it's
time to build a summer house for the kids to go to, and
grandchildren who might come along.
</P>
<P>
   The house they just finished, and moved into, now shuttling back
and forth from Worcester, is a summer house in the grand tradition:
a big house, on the water, with mooring sites for the family boats,
and a widow's walk whence you can see quite a bit of Cape Cod on a
clear day.
</P>
<P>
   The house is traditional on the outside, with clapboards stained
with typcial Cape Cod restraint, but it's the custom touches,
indoors and out, that make it worth of ruffles and flourishes and
much more.
</P>
<P>
   Stephan Petty of Sherborn, Mass. is the designer, construction
manager, and carpenter who likes to wield a hammer and saw on
occasion. Petty has designed Timber Frame houses for many years,
and the Spillane house is timber framed, in modern post and beam
style.
</P>
<P>
   Petty, at the Spillane's suggestion, made the custom touches.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in addition to some 12 rooms, there is a mail
center in the mud-room. Well, maybe not a mail center but a series
of pigeon holes, enough for the whole family; after all, seven
people get a lot of mail, and it's a good idea to keep everything
separate.
</P>
<P>
   The finest touch indoors is a remarkable living room, not only
big but with a ceiling 26 feet from floor to ridgeline. It's all
timbered, with an equally high stone fireplace, a balcony on each
side of the interior chimney, all looking out an entire wall of
glass, from floor nearly to the ridge.
</P>
<P>
   The stonework is by Michael Mountain of Brewster, Mass., a mason
who specializes in stone, which was quarried in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   On the oak floor, just in front of the sliders leading outdoors,
is another custom touch, an outsized compass rose, an appropriate
touch for a family who sails.
</P>
<P>
   It's made of inlaid mahogany, cherry, maple, walnut, and brass.
Strangely, it is oriented several degrees off from north. Not so
strangely, Petty explained. It is a little off because the
Spillanes wanted it oriented to the house, not to the world.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the custom touches, Rosemary Spillane, who was busy
washing her own windows, said the family wanted the house to be
simple, to bring the outdoors into the house. Her wishes were
granted: The views are great, she said, even from the bathrooms,
even in winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to spend more time here in winter, with my kids,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   There are other touches she can enjoy. The house is full of
painted matchstick wainscoting, but it's made of routed hardboard.
</P>
<P>
   And, all the woodwork is custom-milled belly casing made of
poplar. And, the corner blocks in the door and window casings are
nicely carved seashells. It's all done by Woodsmith Millwork in
Falmouth.
</P>
<P>
   The staircase is a standard but quality unit made by Brosco,
cusotmized with a mahogany railing. The railings on the two
balconies are also customized, and the work of Woodsmith Millwork.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs are three bedrooms and a satisfactory collection of
bathrooms. There's a master bedroom on the first floor, but Mrs.
Spillane said the bedroom just above it has a better view.
</P>
<P>
   But the custom prize upstairs is the stairs that lead to the
widow's walk on the roof. It is a perfect ship's companionway, all
mahogany and all varnished. It is tricky but fun to go up and down
those steep stairs. And the view is worth the risk.
</P>
<P>
   Other touches that would please a king, or at least a prince,
are copper screening on the screen porch, which will tend to
corrode less than aluminum, especially on the cape, a deck of
ironwood, a tropical hardwood called palupe, that Petty said is so
dense that when he put a 2 x 6 six inches long in water, it sank.
</P>
<P>
   The roof is cedar shingles treated to be fire resistant. They
are set on strapping on the roof to provide full ventilation under
them, an important technique to prevent premature decay.
</P>
<P>
   One challenge was how to put flashing around the stone chimney,
a huge structure that goes right through the middle of the roof.
After all, the flashing is mortared into the joints, and with stone
those joints are normally very uneven.
</P>
<P>
   It was no problem for the mason, Michael Mountain, who simply
set the stone so that the joints on the downroof sides were lined
up in a straight line, and those on the sides followed the slope of
the roof, also in a straight line. This allows counter flashing to
be mortared into a straight joint. Sounds like a small thing, but
improper flashing can be the bane of a house, causing all kinds of
leaks, and giving the builder headaches.
</P>
<P>
   Two more small items but ones that make the house good looking
and easier to maintain: No gutters, and inward-sloping fascia
boards which allow roof water to drain over the fascias without
staining them with those ugly black streaks.
</P>
<P>
   The house went up with the cooperation of many companies and
individuals. As Petty put it: ``I design the house with timber
frame in mind, and the Davis Frame Co. of Claremont, N.H. cuts the
frame into its componentn parts,'' so it can be put together like a
jigsaw puzzle or more appropriately, Lincoln Logs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Davis will customize anything,'' Petty said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he Davis used Douglas fir for all the posts and beams,
oiled the wood, puts real pegs in the joints (they're called tree
nails), chamfered all edges so they would be slightly rounded, and
cut lamb's tongues at the ends of all beams. A lamb's tongue is a
decorative edging at the end of a beam to allow it to butt into its
neighbor without gaps. They are not very visible from a distance
but do make a neat job.
</P>
<P>
   And putting it altogether is the builder, Conkley Construction
Co. of Holliston, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   And no gutters!

HELP! THERE'S A DECORATOR LOOSE IN THE HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchases by calling 212-556-4204 or -1927.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL STOCKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was drawn like a moth to the torchier when Lauri Ward, a
big-time New York decorator, agreed to illustrate our interview by
redoing a room in my house. She was promoting her new book, ``Use
What You Have Decorating,'' which is full of heartening
before-and-after pictures of her clients' houses. The jacket blurb
promises: ``Transform your home in one hour with 10 simple design
principles _ using the space you have, the things you like, the
budget you choose.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm always trying to use what I have space-wise, budget-wise,
and thing-wise, so this seemed intriguing. But as the appointment
approached, I found myself viewing my comfortable little nest with
a more critical eye. I realized it wasn't a question of
redecorating because I'd never decorated in the first place. Each
room is divided into areas where you can walk or sit and areas
where you can't, because of the piles of clothes to be washed,
stacks of newspapers to be read, bags of hangers to go back to the
cleaners, and boxes of inherited memorabilia to be sorted. My home
is less a design statement than a to-do list.
</P>
<P>
   Do other people live like this? If not, they must have more
storage room, plus a dry basement. On the other hand, they probably
don't still own a World Book Encyclopedia from the 1940s. I
realized I didn't need a decorator. I needed a yard sale. And I
began to feel that I had set Ward an impossible task.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Ward's simple principle
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But when she arrived, trimly tailored in an expensive navy blue,
she seemed game. She'd done this before. No schmoozer, she was
intent and mostly silent as she toured my home. I would later learn
why.
</P>
<P>
   Use-What-You-Have Interiors is the name of the business Ward
started 18 years ago in New York City, based on the idea that she _
or you, if you read her book _ can redecorate by rearranging and
culling your current belongings without buying anything new.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like an obvious idea. Still, she said, ``people were
taken aback.'' It runs counter to the practice of many interior
decorators who, Ward said, make much of their income as commissions
on new stuff they buy for their clients.
</P>
<P>
   Ward pioneered the concept of ``one-day decorating.'' For an
hourly or by-the-room fee she goes to clients' homes, helps them
rearrange furniture, and tells them what else she thinks they
should do.
</P>
<P>
   She also runs a decorator training program called the Interior
Refiners Network and will refer potential customers to local
graduates. (Call 800-WE-USE-IT or visit her Web site at
www.redecorate.com.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Marking the mistakes
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ward's technique revolves around a kind of decorator's 10
Commandments that she dubs ``the 10 most common decorating
mistakes'' (see table below.)
</P>
<P>
   Ward started in my kitchen where she confronted mistake No.7:
ignoring the room's focal point. The what? ``The focal point is the
largest, most dramatic element in each room. In most kitchens, the
refrigerator is the focal point,'' Ward informed me. On a gut
level, that made sense.
</P>
<P>
   The refrigerator magnets had to go, Ward said. ``Nothing on the
refrigerator. If you need to stick up pictures and notes, get
yourself a nice bulletin board.''
</P>
<P>
   Silly me. I thought the refrigerator was a bulletin board. Could
I really part with my magnetic badger family from England and my
little bear from Yellowstone?
</P>
<P>
   The living room broke rule No.2. It lacked a comfortable
conversation area. Ward defined this as ``a simple arrangement of
furniture so that people can sit facing each other and can speak
without raising their voices.'' (In many living rooms the chairs
are too far apart, placed at what Ward called ``screaming
distance.'')
</P>
<P>
   The basic ingredients for conversation, besides people and a
topic, are a sofa and two upholstered chairs, all within reach of a
piece of furniture serving as a coffee table (it can be an ottoman,
for instance).
</P>
<P>
   Because no more than four people can fit in my living room,
somewhere along the line I had just given up on having a
conversation area.
</P>
<P>
   When my book club meets, we converse around the kitchen table.
In order to make a space to exercise, I had emptied the living room
of everything but a chair for my indoor cats and a gigantic sofa
I'd bought two months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But Ward pointed to the coral leather (it was a terrific buy; a
markdown!) and said, ``It should go. It clashes with the rug, and
it's too big for the room. Get a smaller one, and put it on the
diagonal facing the fireplace. Get a leather ottoman in taupe.''
</P>
<P>
   She pointed to the old wing chair that doubles as a scratching
post for the cats (my way of trying to lure them away from better
furniture). ``Get that reupholstered (with its twin in the garage)
in maroon and taupe stripes in the exact shades in the rug. It will
look beautiful!''
</P>
<P>
   I knew the cats would shred it in no time, but nodded glumly.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A transforming business
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ward selected an upstairs bedroom for actual transformation. She
stripped off her elegant jacket to reveal a white T-shirt
underneath. We were getting down to business.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't time it, but she and her assistant probably took 20
minutes to rearrange the room. And it did look a lot better when
they finished.
</P>
<P>
   While they pulled the bed out from the wall and turned it on the
diagonal, I busted the dust exposed underneath.
</P>
<P>
   Ward banished a rug, my reading light, and all the necessities
of life such as melatonin and night cream that sat on the bedside
table. Then she started building a still life out of objects from
all over the house that she had spotted during that initial prowl.
</P>
<P>
   She quickly assembled the best things I owned: my maritime
painting, my Wedgwood statue, my Chinese lacquer sewing box. She
cannily pulled out the good stuff, things I halfway took for
granted because they had sat for so long surrounded by not-so-good
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   She discarded the gold rocking chair with customized cushions
that matched the wallpaper and replaced it with a somber,
brown-upholstered Lincoln rocker that went with nothing.
</P>
<P>
   It looked great.
</P>
<P>
   Ward then added other touches of brown to the table top, such as
the sewing box and an antique leather photo album and a fistful of
eagle feathers she had spotted in other rooms. Brown is a big
decorator color this year. The bedroom morphed from quaint to
stylish before my eyes.
</P>
<P>
   But was it livable?
</P>
<P>
   Also banished was the bedside book I was reading, a red
paperback copy of ``Gone With the Wind'' with Clark Gable clutching
Vivian Leigh on the cover while Atlanta burned. Admittedly, it
didn't go with the new decor.
</P>
<P>
   Ward replaced it with Carol Gilligan's ``Mapping the Moral
Domain'' and Stephen Davis's ``Jajouka Rolling Stone,'' hardcovers
with lots of brown. But they were books I had already read.
</P>
<P>
   This brought to mind a gentleman I had once interviewed who,
among his many more notable endeavors, was making matching paper
book covers for every volume he owned so they would not clash with
his living-room decor.
</P>
<P>
   As Ward flew out of the front door to catch a plane to the next
city on her book tour, she turned and reiterated her theme. ``You
already have everything you need. You just have to learn how to use
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I had much to learn, including what I wanted in a home.
Beauty or comfort? Brown books or red?
</P>
<P>
   Mulling this eternal conundrum of form vs. function, I headed
back upstairs to close the door to the redecorated bedroom. The
cats lived for unguarded opportunities to sharpen their claws on
that Lincoln rocker. For them, it had always been a focal point.

FAITH HILL: CROONER NOT JUST FOR COUNTRY FANS ANY MORE 
</HEADLINE>
 HILL-MUSIC-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDY CORDOVA  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - If Faith Hill had to name her favorite year, chances
are '98 would be in the running.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, she gave birth to her second child, Maggie
Elizabeth. And professionally, she hit the kind of heights that
even fellow Nashville stars must envy.
</P>
<P>
   She's headlining her own tour, filling amphitheater-size venues.
She picked up a Country Music Association Award a few weeks ago and
was up for three other trophies.
</P>
<P>
   Most impressively, her adventurous third album, ``Faith,''
inspired music critics to pen virtual love letters. And it clicked
not only with country fans, but with pop-music buffs who turned the
jangly ``This Kiss'' into a Top 10 crossover smash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still surprised,'' she says in her buttery Mississippi
drawl. ``We have people at our shows that are pop people. It
happened in such an organic way. It's just a perfect example of how
a great song can transcend any boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Cracking pop-music radio is tough _ ``It's like a sea of
sharks,'' the 31-year-old Hill says. And she has managed to enjoy
the best of both worlds, because she hasn't alienated her country
audience. ``Let MeLet Go,'' the latest single from ``Faith,''
already has zoomed into the country Top 20.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the overwhelming success of the album has to do with the
different moods and textures featured. Hill worked with two
producers on the project, something fairly uncommon in the country
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither producer heard what the other one was doing,'' Hill
says. ``Then at the very end, when I listened to it, it flowed
really well. I was so happy about that _ when you're working the
way we worked, the album could have been a mess, going from one
sound to another.''
</P>
<P>
   The album mixes songs by familiar Nashville writers (Matraca
Berg, Beth Nielsen Chapman) with heavy hitters from the pop world
(Sheryl Crow, Diane Warren). It sounds risky, but a definite thread
of continuity exists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the consistent ingredient,'' Hill says. ``There's a lot
of textures to life, a lot of moods. I have a lot of different
tastes. I could decorate five houses, and they would all look
totally different. This gave me the chance to explore all the
little, quirky things in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   It had been three years since Hill's last album, the 2
million-selling ``It Matters to Me.'' That's an eternity between
albums in the country-music world, but Hill was hardly out of the
spotlight. Her courtship and eventual marriage with superstar Tim
McGraw made her a mainstay in the gossip pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time off for me was crucial,'' she says, popping into her
hotel room in Bakersfield, Calif. ``I had so many changes in my
personal life that were just huge. I mean, there were big leaps and
bounds.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, most of the talk surrounding the two has been of the
``look how happy they are'' variety.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love each other unconditionally,'' she says. ``We don't
worry about what people say. We're just so happy, and if people
enjoy watching us, we don't mind at all. Everyone likes to see
people who are happy. No one can begrudge someone happiness _ if
they want to, there's something wrong with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only does the public like to watch them, fans love to listen
to them. So far, the couple have recorded two duets.
</P>
<P>
   Both ``It's Your Love'' and ``Just to Hear You Say That You Love
Me'' were massive hits.  &QL;

CROSBY'S NEW BANDMATE ALSO HIS SON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Some bands come together when the musicians hook
up in high school. Others audition. For James Raymond, it took a
long voyage of discovery to find his current band mate _ his dad,
folk-rocker David Crosby.
</P>
<P>
   Today, father and son are playing together with Jeff Pevar in a
trio called C.P.R. (Crosby, Pevar and Raymond).
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, when Raymond first met his birth father, he was
30 years old, married and expecting his first child. He had known
he was adopted as an infant and, with his parents' blessing, sought
out his birth records under state family adoption laws.
</P>
<P>
   Disbelief was his first reaction, but he eventually made contact
with his birth mother, who had married and emigrated to Australia
years earlier. She confirmed that Raymond's biological father was
indeed David Crosby, founding member of the Byrds and Crosby,
Stills &AMP; Nash (and sometimes Young).
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd already been a musician for 20 years when we met,''
Crosby said. ``He's brilliant, much better than me. He sought me
out and we've become great friends.''
</P>
<P>
   C.P.R. appears Saturday night at the Wiltern Theatre in Los
Angeles in support of the band's recently issued self-titled debut
album. Pevar, who has no known genetic link to Raymond or Crosby,
has played with Rickie Lee Jones, Ray Charles and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little choked up about it when we met because I'd
always worried about him and stuff, but he's a very kind young
guy,'' said Crosby, 57, from his home near Santa Barbara. ``He
understood I couldn't have been a parent at that time in my life,
and he's now my close dear family and friend.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time keyboardist Raymond was tracking his dad down,
Crosby was hospitalized with a fatally failing liver, his life
hanging on the availability of a donor organ. Hearing the news,
Raymond's adopted father wrote to Crosby, revealing his son was
interested in meeting his birth father.
</P>
<P>
   They met in the hospital room.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a wonderful songwriter,'' Crosby said. ``And a great
guitarist, too. He listened to a lot of jazz and classical music,
which I did, too. And he listened to the great keyboard composers
as well as Elton John and groups like Toto and Steely Dan, which
you can hear in his music.''
</P>
<P>
   Raymond had been musical director for Nickelodeon's
``Roundhouse'' series, and has played with such diverse acts as
Oleta Adams, Ronnie Laws, Chaka Khan, Tom Scott and others.
</P>
<P>
   Crosby, for his part, still is working on other projects.
Crosby, Stills &AMP; Nash, he says, are halfway done cutting an album,
with a tour planned for next summer. &QL;

THE WOMAN WHO CAME FROM THE SEA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I met the most amazing lady in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   This is how it happened. Jack and I, our younger daughter,
Julie, and her husband, Chris, spent three days in Florence before
settling into a small Italian hill town called Vernazza for some
hiking. We were visiting the Cinque Terra, a series of five
medieval villages tucked into a mountain range at the edge of the
Ligurian Sea, and our only goal was to walk the donkey paths that
wind their way through olive groves and vineyards high above the
water, linking the towns by foot trails.
</P>
<P>
   Jack and I had been to Cinque Terra 15 years ago, and to our
amazement and delight, almost nothing had changed. Pastel buildings
still rose straight up from narrow passageways tiled with stone.
Outdoor cafes still dotted peaceful squares undisturbed by
automobile traffic. Fishermen still brought their catch into town
at dawn and the pesto, made from homegrown basil and olives pressed
locally, was even more delicious than we remembered. We noticed one
new device, a small wagon on rubber tracks that enabled citizens to
carry loads up the winding stone staircases without breaking their
backs. We could have used one when we dragged our luggage up the 82
steep steps to our room.
</P>
<P>
   Every day we had breakfast, hiked, dropped into one of the towns
for a leisurely lunch, caught the train or a boat back to Vernazza,
napped, and spent our evenings at El Castillo, a 400-year-old
fortification high above the town, now a restaurant with a
magnificent view of the coast at sunset. You can get the flavor of
the area from this warning, posted exactly this way by authorities:
``We take the liberty of submitting to your attention the
particular oreography of our villages which, constituting the
reason for its esteem and characteristic feature, cause a
narrowness of space and structure at everyone's disposal. The calm
and tranquillity of this places, common interest of tourists and
inhabitants, are entrusted to the behavioral modification of
everybody. For that reason during the hours after sunset all kind
of clamour and noise or every disturbance of people's repose ...
will be punished like an indictable offense.''
</P>
<P>
   We amused ourselves in the evenings by playing very quiet games
of Rummy Cub.
</P>
<P>
   I met this woman as we hiked the most challenging portion of the
trail between Vernazza and Monterosso al Mar, the only one of the
towns with a sandy crescent of beach. There was something about the
sparkling water below, occasionally disturbed by the splashing of
dolphins, that seemed to clear her mind. With a bathing suit in her
backpack and a burning desire to throw herself into the ocean the
minute they descended to sea level, she was conscious of little
beside the warmth of the sun on her face and the delicious smell of
the perfumed air.
</P>
<P>
   E-mails and faxes and a list of things to do half a mile long
seemed artifacts from some previous life, irritants that she had
shed as easily as her previous _ now ridiculous _ concern with
dieting. She couldn't remember why she'd ever entertained the
thought that the earth and every person on it was doomed. Not
having misplaced a valuable piece of paper for days, she was no
longer tormented by the quirks of her attention-deficit-disordered
mind. She was in tune with all that was important _ people she
loved, a body she could count on, a sense of well-being powerful
enough to ground her in the present moment.
</P>
<P>
   While others sipped cappuccino in a beachside restaurant, this
woman ran down to the almost-deserted beach and dived into the sea.
Salty and buoyant, it lifted her up and rocked her effortlessly, a
cradle powered by gentle waves. This is the knowledge from which
all action springs, she thought, feeling herself floating under the
sky, a mere speck in a universe of souls. With a wave of gratitude,
she felt beating within her body what Joseph Campbell calls ``the
rapture of being alive.'' She gave me that memory as a gift to
bring home with me.
</P>
<P>
   I also returned from Italy with a new pocketbook, but when I put
it into service, it had too many zippers for someone with so much
to do in a hurry. I was about to ditch it when this woman prompted,
``Use the zippers as an excuse to stop whatever you're doing and
breathe deeply. Let them slow you down enough to give you time to
remember why you're here.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm using it now, thankful for the inconvenience. Like a
seashell held to the ear, it brings me back to a moment in time
when I knew what truly mattered.

   NEW YORK _ With Alfonse D'Amato tossed out of power after an
18-year reign not only as US senator but also as kingmaker of the
New York Republican machine, all eyes are shifting to the state's
other two GOP powers, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and
Governor George W. Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are about the same age (54 and 53, respectively). Both
are lawyers, Roman Catholic, and relatively moderate on social
issues. And both are widely seen as holding ambitions for higher _
even the highest _ office.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki is the sharper object of focus this week, because, unlike
his onetime mentor D'Amato, he won his reelection battle Tuesday,
crushing Democratic challenger Peter Vallone 54-33, with a handful
of independent candidates dividing the remainder.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani won his second four-year term in the mayoral race last
year, but he gallivanted all over the country, campaigning for
several Republican candidates, D'Amato included.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Wednesday, Pataki waved off questions about
presidential prospects, though he has made no bones about them in
the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question,'' said one Republican political consultant, who
asked not to be identified, ``Pataki is on most people's
short-lists for president or vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Carroll, head of the Quinnipiac College Polling
Institute, asked, ``Why not? A northeastern, moderate, pro-choice
Catholic _ that sounds pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet others wonder whether Pataki was hurt or helped by Tuesday's
results.
</P>
<P>
   On a practical level, Democratic consultant Henry Sheinkopf
noted, D'Amato was going to be ``the man who would navigate Pataki
through the Washington corridors, through the PAC maze, through all
the fund-raisers.'' When D'Amato lost his Senate seat, Pataki
``lost his money man, and early money matters most of all in a
presidential campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   On a more analytic level, Pataki did not do as well himself as
his huge margin over Vallone suggests at first glance.
</P>
<P>
   First, he did not win New York City, though he very much hoped
to do so, as a display that he could carry the entire state.
</P>
<P>
   Second, statewide, Pataki won no more votes than he did in his
1994 squeaker over then-Democratic incumbent Mario Cuomo, about 2.4
million both on Tuesday and four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The difference this time was that his Democrat opponent received
so many fewer votes and the other, minor-party candidates,
especially the well-funded Independent Party candidate, Tom
Golisano, who picked up 350,000 votes, got so many more.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, though Pataki campaigned with D'Amato across the state
for four days solid, he could not help the man who pulled him out
of obscurity and made him governor four years ago hang on to his
seat.
</P>
<P>
   The scope and depth of D'Amato's defeat, at the hands of
Brooklyn Congressman Charles Schumer, was more profound than even
the decisive 54-44 vote count suggests.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato needed a big win upstate to offset Schumer's obvious
lead in the city. Yet, despite Pataki's own domination upstate,
D'Amato edged out Schumer there by a mere 5-to-4 margin.
</P>
<P>
   In the suburbs, where he also needed huge numbers, D'Amato held
a smaller lead still.
</P>
<P>
   And in New York City, where D'Amato needed to hang on to his
base support, Schumer crushed him, 3-to-1. Except for Staten Island
and two neighborhoods in Brooklyn, the Italian district of
Bensonhurst and the Orthodox Jewish enclave of Borough Park,
D'Amato did not win a single one of the city's Assembly districts.
</P>
<P>
   In several districts of Harlem, Washington Heights, and the
South Bronx, where black and Hispanic voters were galvanized by
President Clinton and union campaigns to turn out in greater
strength than usual, D'Amato lost by 10-to-1 margins or more.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki did much better than D'Amato everywhere, but, as several
analysts put it, he had no coattails. ``If he can't carry New York
state, not even upstate, for Alfonse D'Amato,'' one Republican
official put it, ``how can he carry it for George W. Bush,'' the
Texas presidential prospect who was handily reelected governor
Wednesday?
</P>
<P>
   However, another angle on the election figures puts Pataki in a
brighter light. The fact is, Pataki himself won every county
outside New York City. And even within the city, he cut into
Democratic strongholds.
</P>
<P>
   The proof is this: City voters favored Schumer over D'Amato by
600,000 votes, but they favored Vallone over Pataki by just
300,000. In other words, half of the city dwellers who voted for
Schumer split their tickets and pulled Pataki's lever for governor.
</P>
<P>
   This fact cannot help but intrigue Republican leaders who want a
candidate who can pull in urban Democrats and yet who find
Giuliani, a more high-profile possibility, a bit too personally
abrasive.

CALIFORNIA CONVENTION BID GETS A BOOST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and p coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With the outcome of Tuesday's elections,
California would seem to have clinched the 2000 Democratic National
Convention: control of the governor's office for the first time in
16 years, a new lieutenant governor who is now the nation's
highest-ranking state official of Hispanic descent, and a US Senate
triumph in a tight race.
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, a few snags, mainly Monica Lewinsky and a
Buddhist temple.
</P>
<P>
   Both caused trouble for the Democrats, one over White House sex,
the other over foreign campaign contributions involving Vice
President Al Gore. Both are said to make Gore nervous about setting
the convention in Los Angeles, since the city is home to both. And
as the putative nominee, he has the final say.
</P>
<P>
   But the latest election results may force Gore to swallow his
nervousness, several political analysts and state party leaders
said Wednesday. The Democrats' sweep of state races was too great,
their showing among women and Hispanic voters too substantial to
set it anywhere else now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, dear God, what more do you need to underscore the
resurgence of the Democratic Party?'' said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a
political scientist at Claremont Graduate University. ``This a
statement that they would want and need to showcase ... But it
depends on how self-confident Al Gore is about sending that message
from Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal is not clinched yet. Along with Boston, Los Angeles is
one of seven cities in the running. But Los Angeles, situated in
the most important electoral state, is certain to be on the list of
finalists announced next Thursday. Philadelphia, where black voters
have long backed Democrats, is also expected to make the cut.
Political observers described Boston's chances as solid but less
certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``California did itself no harm Wednesday with the extraordinary
wall-to-wall victories we achieved in what I can only describe as
the 800-pound gorilla of American politics,'' said Steve Grossman,
a Boston native who is chairman of the Democratic National
Committee. ``LA is going to be a major factor in this convention
decision-making process right to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   With 30 million-plus residents and 54 electoral votes,
California is more important politically than the six New England
states combined. It is also home to more Hispanics than any other
state, a demographic group being wooed strongly by both major
political parties. Major donors to the Democratic Party also live
here, among them David Geffen, cofounder of the Dreamworks SKG
movie studio, who helped put together the city's bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fundamentally this comes down to one simple fact: The
Democratic nominee for president cannot become president unless he
or she carries California,'' said Bill Wardlaw, a Los Angeles
lawyer who headed up Mayor Richard Riordan's efforts to win the
convention. ``Any successful strategy has to be based on securing
California as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   But DNC officials and others not involved in the selection
process stressed that numerous criteria go into the decision, from
availability of hotel rooms to transportation access to the design
of the convention facilities.
</P>
<P>
   One factor that could hurt California is a decision by voters
Tuesday to continue with open primaries, allowing anyone eligible
to vote to choose a candidate from any party -- a practice opposed
by the political parties themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we had such a big win here, such a comprehensive
one, obviously has a positive influence on picking Los Angeles for
the convention,'' said Bill Carrick, a Democratic media consultant.
``But it's not a given. My sense is that they're taking a hard look
at Los Angeles, Boston, and Philadelphia, which are all important
politically for different reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Leibowitz, Boston's director of intergovernmental
relations and Mayor Thomas M. Menino's point man on the convention
bid, said he remains convinced that the city is still in a close
race. Massachusetts' Democratic tradition is strong, he noted, and
on Tuesday Democrats carried ``everything that wasn't nailed down''
except the governorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of ways to reward a major state like
California besides a convention,'' said Leibowitz, such as
selecting US Senator Dianne Feinstein as the vice presidential
nominee in 2000. ``We still think Boston provides the best overview
of the accomplishments of the Democratic administration as we enter
the new millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, officials involved in the convention bid were
preparing to write letters and make telephone calls on the city's
behalf. Andy Spahn, an executive with Dreamworks, &UR;  &LR; said he and
others involved in the process want to ensure that national party
leaders know that Democrats held on to both the state Senate and
Assembly, and that a number of key leadership positions in both
houses are held by Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's obvious that the convention has to be here, in Al
Gore country, where people love him,'' said Art Torres, chairman of
the California Democratic Party. ``The temple and Monica Lewinsky
won't resonate with voters. If this election proved anything, it's
that the voters are smarter than people give them credit for.''

NEW MACOS 8.5 FRUSTRATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON GARFINKLE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let the truth be known, I really do miss my Macintosh. I gave up
my Mac a little more than a year ago when I developed a bad case of
tendinitis; to save my hands, I started using Dragon Naturally
Speaking, a continuous speech recognition system. While speech
recognition software is available for the Mac, it doesn't have the
power of Naturally Speaking.
</P>
<P>
   So I was a bit curious when Apple Computer Inc. sent me a review
copy of its newest operating system, MacOS 8.5. Seizing the
opportunity, I decided to try it out with my friend Aaron, a
Mac-intosh enthusiast.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron and I tested MacOS 8.5 on a PowerPC 9600 with 64 megabytes
of RAM and a 4-gigabyte hard drive. The system had an impressive
load of applications, including PhotoShop, Microsoft Office, and a
variety of Web publishing tools.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, MacOS 8.5 is Apple's first Internet release. Many
Internet features that have until now only been available from
third-party or shareware applications are now bundled into Apple's
operating system. For example, the Date/Time control panel now
allows you to automatically set the system date and time from a
Network Time Server. Meanwhile, the functionality of the infamous
Macintosh Internet Config utility has been subsumed into a new
Internet control panel
</P>
<P>
   The biggest Internet-savvy feature in MacOS 8.5 is Apple's new
Sherlock search system. Previously called Find Files, you can use
Sherlock to search for information three different ways. First, you
can search for all of the files that have a particular name. Next,
you can index your hard drive and search for any file that contains
a given keyword. Finally, you can turn Sherlock loose on the
Internet, and have it search via Web sites such as AltaVista,
Hotbot, Excite, and Infoseek.
</P>
<P>
   Macintosh users are positively enamored with Sherlock's
features. Although companies like On Technology of Cambridge have
sold hard-drive indexing tools in the past, most Mac users have
never known that it exists. Now its built-in.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these various improvements, however, there are still a
lot of things that are frustrating about MacOS. MacOS is
multitasking, which means that you can run more than one
application at a time, but the operating system still does not have
preemptive multitasking, which means that one process can interrupt
another.
</P>
<P>
   What this means in layman's terms is that every now and then the
Mac seems to lock up and become unresponsive. It hasn't crashed _
it's simply doing something that can't be interrupted. This is most
visible when applications are launching. Yes, MacOS 8.5 launches
applications faster than MacOS 7.5 and possibly faster than 8.0,
but while an application is launching your system is basically
unusable.
</P>
<P>
   That's annoying for people like me who are constantly switching
between applications. (I frequently browse the Web or read a few
e-mail messages while a complicated application is starting up on
my Windows machine.) Some programs, such as Apple's new Help
Browser, are particularly bad offenders in this department.
</P>
<P>
   Apple is calling MacOS 8.5 The Must-Have Upgrade. Unfortunately,
a lot of current Apple users are locked out of the 8.5 experience.
According to Apple, MacOS 8.5 requires a PowerPC computer with 16
megabytes of physical RAM and virtual memory set to at least 24
megabytes of RAM.
</P>
<P>
   But I was unable to install it on a Performa 5300 computer that
had 32 megabyes of RAM. Apple's upgrade software refused to update
the operating system on the hard drive, and when we tried to boot
from the CD-ROM and do a clean install, the installer crashed,
complaining that the system didn't have enough memory.
</P>
<P>
   You should also avoid install MacOS 8.5 on Macintosh clones that
were made by companies like Power Computing, SuperMac, Motorola,
and UMAX. Although these machines would run MacOS 8.0, Apple
terminated the clone maker's MacOS license when it decided to
jettison those annoying clone companies that were making computers
that were faster and cheaper than what Apple could produce.
</P>
<P>
   Big warnings on the SuperMac Web site advise customers that if
you try to install MacOS 8.5 on a non-Apple branded computer, you
are doing so at your own risk.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Macintosh Web sites such as Macintouch and TidBits have
also reported that some people have had their hard disks severely
damaged upon installation of MacOS 8.5. This seems to affect less
than 1 percent of all MacOS users _ mostly people with non-Apple
SCSI hard drives that are using third-party disk drives.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, MacOS 8.5 warns against installation if it detects that
you are using a non-Apple hard drive. This is just insanity on
Apple's part, a cynical attempt to extort more money from the
Mac-intosh-loving public. A hard disk is a hard disk, and Apple is
the only company I know that has gimmicked its operating system to
behave differently when run with hard drives that were purchased on
the open market (where customers can typically save hundreds of
dollars off the price charged by Mother Apple).
</P>
<P>
   Overall, I see the advances in MacOS 8.5 as largely cosmetic,
not revolutionary. With a selling price of $99 and guaranteed mass
appeal, Apple is sure to make a lot of money on the product. But
rather than working on glitz, I would rather see the company spend
its R&AMP;D dollars on fixing the fundamental problems with the MacOS
plumbing.

AT THE BREEDER'S IT'S A `RED' ALERT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ The pride of Celtic Pride Stable, none other
than The Groom Is Red, was lounging for his morning bath outside
Barn 41 in the chill of early morn Wednesday at Churchill Downs.
``Knock on wood,'' mused Nick Zito, knocking on a wooden sawhorse
keeping gawkers away from the colt, ``but he's doing fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Zito's cell phone rang.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me,'' said the trainer.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden came an animated talk, punctuated by ``Red''
this and ``Red'' that, ``Jersey Red'' and ``Red Auerbach'' and
``Red'' everything, Zito emphasizing the words in his New York
accent. Just whom was The Groom Is Red named for, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody from Boston,'' said Zito with a laugh as he folded up
his cell phone. ``I guess there's a big fight going on up there.
Jersey Red or Red Auerbach? Who's he named after?''
</P>
<P>
   And of course, as always with Zito and Celtic Pride Stable and
owner Rick Pitino and Pitino's confidant, Ken Ford, a k a Jersey
Red, there was a story behind the story. The Groom Is Red, who may
be favored in Saturday's Breeders' Cup Juvenile at Churchill Downs,
merely runs his races as Boston argues over which proud Bostonian
gave him his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's what happened,'' said Zito in a New York whisper.
``Somebody ... I guess Red (Auerbach) has a few enemies up there,
you know? ... so Rick somehow, he was just walking along and some
(media) guy says to Rick, `Hey, the horse is named after Jersey
Red, huh?' And Rick says, `Red Auerbach.'''
</P>
<P>
   Zito laughed heartily. ``So now they're having a field day with
it up there. What baloney. The horse is named after Red Auerbach
and not Jersey Red. Ohh, and now Jersey's going crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Groom Is Red ``was originally named Father Jack,'' said
Zito. But when Pitino and pals bought the colt, the name was
changed. But, said Zito, if you look closely at the colt's halter,
``you can see that we still have Father Jack on it.''
</P>
<P>
   An NBC-TV crew had just been through the barn, preparing
features for Saturday's telecast, and Zito was able to practice the
standard story he now tells all questioners. ``I told 'em, `Rick
Pitino probably named him after Red Auerbach, and I named him after
Jersey Red.' Hey. I'm a street kid. I named him after a street
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   To all of which Rick Pitino could only chuckle. ``You'd think
we'd name a little scrawny horse after Red Auerbach?'' said the
Celtics coach by phone from Miami International Airport, where he
was en route home to Boston after delivering a motivational speech
in Puerto Rico. ``No, we're waiting for a grand, strapping horse to
name after Red (Auerbach). This one's named for Jersey Red. He's
little and scrawny, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Celtic Pride Stable, trainer included, is an assemblage of
storytellers, and this story has a version ... or two ... or three.
``No,'' said Pitino with a laugh when told that Zito was claiming
Pitino had said the horse was named after Auerbach. ``That's not
true. I never said that to anyone. That never happened. The horse
has always been named after Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   Good thing, too, because this fun crowd was spreading the word
down here in Luh-vul that the reason Jersey Red was nowhere to be
seen around Churchill Downs was that he had left in a huff and
headed back to Boston when he was told the Auerbach story. In fact,
Jersey Red was back in Fall River, Mass., but pulling a prank on
Pitino ... and chuckling and chuckling.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a thing in the papers up here about Rick saying
`Red' was named after Red (Auerbach),'' said Ford, who has another
life as a culinary arts teacher at Durfee High School in Fall
River. ``So I had one of the custodians here at the school call up
Rick and tell him that some teachers had put an article into
everyone's locker saying that `Red' was named after Red Auerbach
and I was furious. But Rick wouldn't fall for it. He just
laughed.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, said Pitino, he had seen through the prank and merely
had another laugh. The coach Wednesdaysaid he was unaware of any
flap _ real or imaginary _ over the naming of The Groom Is Red.
``All I know,'' said the coach, ``is that the horse is named after
Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   Jersey Red said the week has been good for laughs. This was just
another laugh, said Jersey Red, ``for those sorry souls who've been
hanging around Rick, those Damon Runyon characters he loves _
(Celtics equipment man) John `Joe Idaho' Connor, (college
basketball coach) Ralph `Krammy' Willard, (Delaware-New York horse
trainer) John `The Horse' Parisella, and all those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Horse'' makes sense, but ``Joe Idaho'' and ``Krammy''?
Connor has ``always been a big fan of Joe Montana,'' said Jersey
Red, ``so we call him Joe Idaho. And Krammy's for Ralph Kramden
(Jackie Gleason's famed `Honeymooners' character), of course.'' Of
course.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all laugh,'' said Jersey Red. ``Just like I've been having
a good laugh all this week.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pitino may not be the center of attention he was just six
months ago when, as the former Kentucky coach, he returned to the
Bluegrass State to see his Halory Hunter run fourth in the Kentucky
Derby, only to break down just before the Preakness. The coach had
intended to be here by now, but his wife, Joanne, underwent
arthroscopic knee surgery recently and suffered minor
complications. ``I probably won't make it to the race,'' said
Pitino. ``I'll be with Joanne.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Pitino asked, ``How's `Red' looking?'' Very good, he was
told. Zito is full of confidence, and the colt just may be good
enough to win the Breeders' Cup and come back to Louisville for the
1999 Derby.

DOUG VS. DREW: TAKING THE MEASURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Doug or Drew? Drew or Doug?
</P>
<P>
   It's absurd, right? When Drew Bledsoe, everybody's All-American,
was selected by the Patriots with the No. 1 pick in the NFL draft
in 1993, Doug Flutie was playing against assorted Rough Riders of
Canada. Doug was nothing more than a regional relic of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Doug was big back in the days when Larry Bird was big. Doug was
big when Michael Dukakis was big (aren't they actually the same
height?). Doug was big when Ted Danson had hair and Arsenio Hall
had talent.
</P>
<P>
   Now here we are in the middle of the 1998 NFL season and Doug is
bigger than Drew. Wednesday he was named the Bills' starting
quarterback for the remainder of the season, which is quite a
bombshell in Buffalo and all around the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Doug is big again. He's bigger than teammate Bruce Smith and
wide load Bill Parcells. He's the biggest thing in the whole NFL,
which means the jugheads of talk radio are wondering if the
Patriots would be better off with Doug instead of Drew.
</P>
<P>
   Doug or Drew? Drew or Doug? It is the perfect argument to fuel
the bonfire of the nitwits. Citizens of Doug Nation, a silent
majority all these years, have emerged from their bunkers, marching
down Route 1, calling for Doug.
</P>
<P>
   It's incredible to think that we actually had Doug calling the
shots for the Patriots in 1987, '88, and '89. Doug went 8-5 as a
starter with the Raymond Berry Pats, but Berry benched him for the
crucial season finale in Denver in 1988 (the Patriots lost). Things
were the never the same thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Now Doug is back in the NFL, bigger than ever. Coming off the
bench in another dazzling rescue mission, he's got the woebegone
Bills tied for first with the Pats, Jets, and Dolphins in the AFC
East. And there are folks who actually wonder if New England would
be better served by Doug than Drew.
</P>
<P>
   This much we know: Drew is everything Doug is not. And Doug is
everything Drew is not.
</P>
<P>
   So here is the tale of the tape: Doug vs. Drew. The intangibles.
</P>
<P>
   Hair: Doug's got that retro '80s, Mark Harmon/Sally Field look.
He looks like he's wearing a helmet even when he's not wearing a
helmet. Drew is very much a close-cropped quarterback of the '90s.
Hair edge: Doug.
</P>
<P>
   Height: Doug is 5-9. Drew is 6-5, maybe 6-6. Drew could use the
top of Doug's head as a coaster for his beer mug. Drew could eat
Halloween candy off Drew's head. Height edge: Drew.
</P>
<P>
   Roots: Doug is from Natick. Doug went to Boston College. Doug
still plays basketball, softball, hockey, and touch football around
the Framingham-Natick area. Drew is from Walla Walla, Wash., and
played his college ball in Yakima. Roots Edge: Doug.
</P>
<P>
   Arm Strength: Doug can still throw it a mile. We will never
forget the Moon Shot over Miami. But Drew can throw it 2 miles.
Drew probably has the strongest arm in the NFL. Arm Strength Edge:
Drew.
</P>
<P>
   Mobility: Doug can roll out. Doug can scramble. Doug can do the
barenaked ladies' bootleg fully clothed. Drew is a cigar store
Indian. Drew is an Armand LaMontagne statue. Drew is a still life.
Mobility Edge: Doug.
</P>
<P>
   Union Dues: Drew is a make-no-waves, card-carrying member of the
NFL Players Association. Doug crossed the line with the Pats in
1987. Some will never forgive him for this. Union Dues Edge: Drew.
</P>
<P>
   Agents: Doug was first represented by the late Bob Woolf, who
was believed to be the only agent to ever solicit US hostages. Drew
is represented by the ubiquitous Leigh Steinberg, who is to NFL
quarterbacks what John Williams is to movie scores. Agents Edge:
Drew.
</P>
<P>
   Memorable Moment: Doug had the Hail Mary pass in Miami, one of
the top sports television moments of all time. Drew's most
memorable moment thus far would be either his 45 completions in 70
attempts against the Vikings in 1994 or his playoff fumble against
the Steelers last January. Memorable Moment Edge: Doug.
</P>
<P>
   Stage Presence: Doug is in a band with his brother Darren. Doug
plays drums. Darren Flutie plays guitar. Drew dived off the stage
into a mosh pit at the Paradise last year. Stage Presence Edge:
Doug.
</P>
<P>
   Owner's Pet: Doug's first pro job was quarterbacking the New
Jersey Generals for Donald Trump. In those days, he was known as
``The Doug.'' He was the owner's favorite. Drew plays for Bob Kraft
and has been known to dine with the owner. Owner's Pet Edge: Drew.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial Value: Drew appears on those snazzy ESPN ads. Doug
promote's Flutie Flakes in Greater Buffalo. But there's more to
come for Doug. Much more. Commercial Value Edge: Doug.
</P>
<P>
   Doug wins the battle of intangibles by a narrow, 6-5 count. But
do not be fooled. Drew is still the quarterback for the '90s. He is
the man to lead your football team into the next century. Any NFL
talent scout would tell you so.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, the Pats and Bills meet twice in a three-week span
later this month. And this stupid argument will be settled where
it's supposed to be settled _ on the football field.

   The latest Fugee to drop a solo disc, Pras Michel is selling
records because of the hooky title track, which owes its life to a
Bee Gees sample and was first exposed on the ``Bulworth''
soundtrack. While the beats and grooves here are generally OK,
co-producer Pras is no free-styler, and his rapping skills pale
next to guests like Canibus and Mack 10. Making matters worse, he
includes 12 excruciating minutes of ham-fisted comedy _ you guessed
it: answering-machine skits, hip-hop's most tired cliche. 2 stars

   Oh, the ennui, the blasted, fractured cosmopolitan destruction.
Oh, the bliss. Island has begun a fortuitous series of two-CD
compilations of some of its best artists from the past three
decades, and Faithfull gets the full treatment here. After a
glamorous few years in the spotlight in the late '60s as a Rolling
Stones hanger-on, including co-writing credit on ``Sister
Morphine'' (her version is included in the compilation), Faithfull
fell into a drug-addled decline for a few years before re-emerging
in the late 1970s with a series of strong records. The compilation
starts with her best-known solo song, ``Broken English,'' and keeps
going from there in all the snarling, cracked beauty that
characterized Faithfull's work. If you like an edge to your music,
this razor will slice through your soul. 3 1/2 stars

PATRIOTS STILL IN SEARCH OF A FINISHING TOUCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Patriots need Tom Gordon. Or at least
someone with that mind-set. Someone who can close out games.
</P>
<P>
   Given that, they would have beaten the Jets, whom they led,
14-10, in the fourth quarter. They would have beaten the Dolphins,
whom they led, 9-6, with just over two minutes remaining in
regulation. Instead, they lost both games.
</P>
<P>
   So as they prepare for Sunday's visit by the Atlanta Falcons,
the Patriots own a 5-3 record that could have been 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   To some of the players, it's maddening. To coach Pete Carroll,
it's a trait that must be developed. His team's core players have
been together for up to six years. It boasts big-play types on both
sides of the ball _ Troy Brown, Terry Glenn, Ben Coates, and Drew
Bledsoe on offense, Ty Law and Ted Johnson on defense. But some of
them are hurt, and some of them can't do it alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a play here and play there,'' said Carroll. ``It's
going to continue to be that. Look at the Miami-Buffalo game.
Miami's ahead and Buffalo comes back and wins it in the end. The
Kansas City-Jets thing _ that was at the end. We've won our share
of games at the end. We're going to have to battle every step of
the way. When the play becomes available that we have to make,
hopefully, we can make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Patriots captain Bruce Armstrong thinks it's a two-edged sword.
On the one hand, the Patriots are good enough to keep the game
close until the end. On the other, they've made things hard on
themselves by allowing their opponents to hang around.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to give the other team the chance to go out and come
back because you can't put them away,'' said Armstrong. ``It forces
you to have to send the defense back out. We have to be able to
sustain drives at the end of the game, just as we would in the
beginning or the middle of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe said, ``That's frustrating. To go into the Colts game (a
21-16 victory last Sunday), we had a couple of chances to end it on
offense. You hate to have to send your defense back on the field
because you can't make first downs at the end of the game. (Until)
we get to the point when we can close it out and kneel down and
take the suspense out, unfortunately, the defense is going to have
to make plays and close it out for us. That's not the way we want
to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have gained 245 yards rushing on 64 carries in the
fourth quarter, a 3.8-yard average. In the last three games,
they've gained only 53 yards in the fourth quarter. And they have
only one rushing touchdown all season in the fourth quarter. In
addition, they rank 21st in the NFL in fourth-quarter passing,
completing 50.9 percent with three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   They've been outscored, 58-47, in the fourth quarter and
overtime, in contrast to their domination of the first (37-27),
second (64-33), and third (43-20) quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``What that really entails is executing right at the end of the
game and making the play you really have to make,'' said Carroll.
``It's either going to be made or isn't. Why wouldn't it be made?
It depends on the situation. We needed to get a couple of first
downs at the end of the game and we didn't do it. If we had made
them, everything would have been fine. We ran our route too short
or this and that.
</P>
<P>
   ``And some of that has to do with the other team. They're trying
to do the other thing on the other side of the ball. It's going to
become very important to us to close these games out.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll felt the team did that against the Colts, at least to
some degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe not in the way that you would write about,'' he said,
``but our defense made two huge plays (Lawyer Milloy interceptions)
at the end of that game. That's the way we did it that day.''
</P>
<P>
   Frustrating to some fans is that neither the Jets nor the
Dolphins were better than the Patriots, who had numerous chances to
win both games.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets put together an 80-yard go-ahead drive that had started
in the third quarter and ended with 8:54 left in the fourth, then
scored the clinching TD on a 43-yard pass from Vinny Testaverde to
Dedric Ward with 3:29 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, the Patriots squandered many chances for a comfortable
win. It was a 3-3 game in the fourth quarter, then 6-3, 6-6, and
9-6, Patriots, with 2:13 left.
</P>
<P>
   With a second and 11 on the Miami 17 and 2:26 left, the Patriots
passed twice, and both were incomplete, stopping the clock and
enabling the Dolphins to preserve two timeouts.
</P>
<P>
   That gave the Dolphins _ specifically, quarterback Dan Marino _
enough time to work the ball downfield for the tying field goal,
and in overtime, the Patriots offense never touched the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Colts, the Patriots held on, but after Tony
Simmons's 63-yard touchdown reception made it 21-10 with 14:16
left, the Colts had four more chances. They put one TD on the board
thanks to a couple of missed tackles. But the defense buckled down
and eventually bailed out the offense, which couldn't sustain a
clinching drive.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said there are big-play players the Patriots will go to
in clutch situations: ``Ben is that guy, when it's really tough, we
go to him. We might also run behind Bruce if we need some critical
yardage. I count on Ty Law to make a play.''
</P>
<P>
   While closing out games seems to be the next big hurdle the
Patriots have to surmount, some players, like Larry Whigham, don't
believe there is a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're 5-3 and tied for first place,'' said Whigham. ``We have
to keep playing well. Special teams hasn't played well the last two
weeks, and we need to get better. But we don't have any hurdles to
cross right now. We won last week and we just have to build on
that.''

JUSTICE NOT DONE WITH `THE SIEGE' 
OUR RATING: 2 STARS 
BY GLENN WHIPP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The creative forces behind the new political
thriller ``The Siege'' have their hearts in the right place, but
then they make the mistake of opening their mouths. Again and again
and again.
</P>
<P>
   For about 40 minutes, the film works as a tense, interesting
cat-and-mouse chase between FBI agent Denzel Washington and Arab
terrorists intent on reducing the number of tourist attractions in
New York. Then the film widens its scope and becomes a preachy and
predictable action movie that embraces genre cliches and ethnic
stereotypes with equal fervor. In the end, the real siege is waged
upon your patience. You won't have much left when this
disappointing movie ends.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Zwick, who directed ``The Siege'' and co-wrote it with
magazine writer Lawrence Wright and Menno Meyjes, means for the
film to be an intriguing look at the thin line that exists between
the civil rights of an individual and the principles of a free
society. But Zwick craves spectacle, too, and he never quite finds
the comfort zone between ideas and explosions. He doesn't offer
much in the way of new insights either, so ultimately, it's his
movie, not New York, that goes boom.
</P>
<P>
   Washington plays Anthony Hubbard, a moral dynamo of an FBI agent
assigned to investigate terrorist bomb threats. Together with his
Arab-American partner, Frank Haddad (Tony Shalhoub) and a team of
agents, Hubbard tries to find the bombers before they make good on
their promises. Helping (and often confounding) them is a CIA
operative (Annette Bening) who sheds identities almost as fast as
she discards her clothes when she thinks it will help her cause.
</P>
<P>
   When the terrorist attacks continue, the government panics and
martial law is declared. Tanks roll across the Brooklyn Bridge and
a no-nonsense general (Bruce Willis) uses his power as an excuse to
round up Arab-Americans (seemingly anyone with a two-day beard) and
toss them into makeshift internment camps.
</P>
<P>
   This leads to a lot of hokey speeches about freedom and the
Constitution, a ridiculous gun-pointing ending and a speech by
Willis that seems cribbed from the one Jack Nicholson made at the
end of ``A Few Good Men.'' Except, of course, that Willis is no
Jack Nicholson and the speech, as written, sounds as if it should
come from Gomer Pyle, not a two-star general.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Siege'' has drawn a lot of criticism from Arab and
Muslim-American rights groups, and, to a point, you can see why
they're upset. The film makes precious little distinction between
Arabs and Muslims and perpetuates the stereotypes that link Islam
and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   But then, ``The Siege'' also stereotypes the military as a bunch
of head-bashing, door-smashing goons and even seems to go after
Bill Clinton as the man indirectly responsible for all sorts of
civil rights violations. (We're waiting for the Rush Limbaugh
rave.) The movie features stock footage of Clinton decrying
terrorist activities and later we see (fictional) presidential
advisers clamoring for martial law. Next thing you know, it's World
War II all over again, only it's Arab-Americans and not
Japanese-Americans being fitted for prison garb. (``I feel your
pain ... and then inflict some more.'')
</P>
<P>
   It's another half-baked idea in a movie that's full of them and
full of itself.

RUGGIERO FIRST-CLASS AT HARVARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When last we saw her, Angela Ruggiero was gliding about 3 feet
above the ice at Nagano's Big Hat arena, a US flag dancing from her
upstretched hands, celebrating an Olympic gold medal and the
biggest moment any athlete can ever hope to know.
</P>
<P>
   When she returned shortly afterward to finish her senior year at
Choate Rosemary Hall, it was to a hero's welcome. Flowers. Camera
crews. A standing ovation that threatened to last right into the
next Olympiad.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ruggiero is a freshman at Harvard. A pedigreed freshman, but
a rookie nonetheless. Fetching water bottles for the upperclassmen.
Picking up pucks after practice. Carrying the stick bag on road
trips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely, Angela has to do that,'' said A.J. Mleczko,
Harvard senior and Olympic women's ice hockey teammate. ``Freshmen
have to do this. It's a rite of passage.''
</P>
<P>
   A somewhat reverse rite of passage, to be sure. But if Ruggiero
and the other collegiate Olympians came back from Nagano with any
attitude other than good, no one has seen evidence thereof.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you recruit character, you don't really have those
problems,'' said Crimson coach Katey Stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to help the team,'' said Ruggiero, with simple
sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   She'll have plenty of help in helping the team, what with
forwards Mleczko and Jen Botterill, an Olympian from Canada, as
Crimson mates. They make up 50 percent of the half-dozen Olympians
playing women's college hockey in the US this season. While Mleczko
is a senior, the others are all underclassmen: Botterill is a
freshman, as is Minnesota's Jenny Schmidgall, while Brown's Tara
Mounsey and Providence's Sara DeCosta are sophomores.
</P>
<P>
   While Ruggiero acknowledges the danger of a letdown after the
heights of Olympus, she said she hasn't felt any yet and doesn't
expect to.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a new challenge,'' she said after practice one day
last week. ``The team may be different, but it's my team now. We
have another goal now _ we want to win Ivy League and then ECACs
and nationals eventually. And Harvard hockey has never been that
strong to go that far. So definitely, it's like a new goal for me.
Sure, it's not the Olympic team, but it's my team now. Whatever
team I'm playing on, I'm not going to go slower.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the challenges is being, by all indications, the No. 1
recruit this year in college hockey. Not to mention, as Stone
assesses, ``the best defenseman in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a lot of expectations to live up to, but it doesn't
seem to be affecting her,'' said Mleczko. ``That's such a testament
to her personality. She's dealt with pressure before. That's pretty
phenomenal for an 18-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just crazy Rugger,'' said the 5-foot-11-inch, 175-pound
object of this assessment, who returned to the Choate track team
last spring and set a championship meet record in the shot put (39
feet 9 inches) to go with her school records in the discus and
javelin.
</P>
<P>
   As for Mleczko, she said that while her return to college after
a two-year hiatus has been an adjustment, it's been in terms of
lifestyle and academics rather than hockey. Juggling classes and a
social life in addition to hockey, rather than focusing on the
sport 100 percent, has taken some off-ice practice. But she's
thrilled she decided to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so fun to be back,'' she said.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond fun, the student-athletes realize that, absent a
professional league that was to start playing this month but never
got off the ground, college hockey is where it's at. Listen to
Mleczko and you immediately understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of men I talk to can't believe it: `You maintained your
eligibility for one year of college hockey?''' said the
23-year-old, meaning she had to forgo grants and stipends from the
US Olympic Committee and endorsement opportunities such as
appearing on the Wheaties box _ activities that are not allowed by
the NCAA. ``We gave up a lot. But they don't understand, I can't
just give up my college career and go find some minor league to
play in. This is a great way to continue. I'm pushed as a player
every day, and that's what I need to do to be a contender for the
2002 team. I look at some of my (Olympic) teammates, and they have
nothing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Their Harvard teammates couldn't be happier to have them. ``Just
their presence in the locker room is huge,'' said high-scoring
sophomore Angie Francisco, whose 56 points last season tied her for
third in the ECAC. ``I think everyone's game has gone up. They
force you to push yourself, to demand more of yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone sees it. ``If you can come up against Angela Ruggiero 15
times in practice,'' said the coach, ``chances are you're not going
to come up against that kind of talent in a game that many times.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she cautions against overconfidence, even though no
women's college ice hockey team has ever had three Olympians
because this is the first time there have ever been Olympians.
``Individually, we have kids on this team who have done a lot of
great things,'' she tells her squad. ``Collectively, as a group of
25 Harvard hockey players, they have done nothing. They have no
reputation. They need to make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday (Nov. 5), against the University of Minnesota, they
begin. When the Harvard team gathered for breakfast at Stone's
house one early morning last February to watch the gold-medal game
from Japan, they knew Mleczko planned to come back to school. They
knew Tammy Shewchuk, who took off a year to try out for the
Canadian Olympic team and just missed making it, planned to return.
(The coach had TVs set up in separate rooms so the Americans and
Canadians could watch peacefully, although Francisco reports things
were pretty tame.) Can you imagine, they thought, if Ruggiero and
Botterill would both choose Harvard, too?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if anyone ever thought it would come together
like that,'' Stone said, still amazed. Even she described watching
them on the ice in practice as downright scary sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   But are egos a problem? No, ma'am, said Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympians made it easy for us to adjust,'' she explained.
``They made us realize they're just one of us _ with a gold
medal.''

SANDLER'S `WATERBOY' AWASH IN LAUGHTER 
OUR RATING: 3 STARS  
 
  
BY GLENN WHIPP
</HEADLINE>
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Adam Sandler makes another convincing statement on
behalf of morons everywhere in ``The Waterboy,'' a frequently funny
and heartfelt effort from the same creative team that delivered the
goods earlier this year with ``The Wedding Singer.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandler has made a successful career out of playing lovable
losers, and he has himself a doozy here with Bobby Boucher, a
31-year-old waterboy who lives in Bayou country with his
controlling mother (a wickedly funny Kathy Bates). Bobby is great
at what he does (he offers three choices for water _ distilled,
rain and purified _ and continually tests the pH levels) but the
university coach (Jerry Reed) fires him because his football yahoos
can't resist pulling pranks on him.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby packs up his water buckets and heads to the state's
poorest college, where the football team wears moth-eaten uniforms
and has one ball to use during practice. (The kicker has to boot an
imaginary ball.) Things are so bad, the cheerleaders spend most of
their time on the sidelines passing around the whiskey bottle to
forget the fact that there's nothing to applaud.
</P>
<P>
   When the players abuse Bobby here, the eccentric Coach Klein
(played with self-effacing charm by Henry Winkler) encourages him
to fight back. Bobby does, displaying a tackling ability that
Reggie White would envy. Coach Klein signs him up, the team starts
winning and soon has a chance to win a berth in the state's annual
Bourbon Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Waterboy'' (directed by Frank Coraci and written by
Sandler and Tim Herlihy) has the same appealing blend of idiocy and
sweetness that made ``The Wedding Singer'' so much fun. The laughs
come from a variety of sources _ dead-on digs at the sports world
that are funnier than anything in ``BASEketball'' (look for cameos
by Lawrence Taylor, Jimmy Johnson and Bill Cower), wonderful comic
acting from pros like Bates and Winkler, and an outrageous
assortment of sight gags that we won't spoil by revealing here.
</P>
<P>
   Sandler is still more of a comic than an actor, but he certainly
knows how to tell a joke, when to share the spotlight and how to
make an imbecilic character come to life. He also does a mean
imitation of a stuck pig, which is the sound Bobby makes when he
sacks a quarterback. It's repeated so often, you'll be hearing it
in your sleep _ and probably from the scores of 12-year-old boys
who will be in line to see this movie.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, you might even be making it, too _ a testament to
Sandler's contagious humor and his success at broadening his
audience beyond the skateboard park set.

OLYMPIANS INCREASE VISIBILITY FOR A GROWING SPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone doubting that women's college ice hockey is coming of age
need only scan the Eastern College Athletic Conference preseason
coaches' poll: Despite a roster that includes three 1998 Olympians,
Harvard has been picked to finish fourth. Fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just awesome,'' said coach Katey Stone. ``There are no
holidays on the schedule anymore. It's a wonderful thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a timely confluence of circumstances, depth has come
to women's college hockey just as women's college hockey needs it
most. Booming youth and high school programs, especially in the
Midwest; a sudden increase in scholarships; an influx of Canadian
players; and the specter of soon becoming an NCAA championship
sport all mesh nicely to complement the six Olympic medalists who
will play college hockey in what looms as a breakthrough season.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to want to see them play,'' said Karen Kay,
beginning her seventh year as coach at the University of New
Hampshire. ``They'll come to look at maybe Tara Mounsey or Angela
Ruggiero but in turn get to see a lot of quality athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, four Olympians will be on the ice when Harvard opens
its season this week at the University of Minnesota. US gold
medalists Ruggiero and A.J. Mleczko will be joined by Canadian
silver medalist Jen Botterill for the Crimson (who also will
welcome back Tammy Shewchuk, one of the final cuts on the Canadian
team), while American Jenny Schmidgall will skate for the Gophers.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Mounsey has returned to play for Brown, while Sara
DeCosta will be back in goal for Providence.
</P>
<P>
   There is unanimity among coaches that the Olympians will have a
profound impact on the college game, not only because they bring
home from Japan sharpened skills and intensity but also by subtly
pushing teammates to elevate their games and opponents to play
their hardest.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to be better than those Olympians,'' said Heather
Linstad, the coach at Northeastern. ``We don't bring back any
Olympians but we want to stay right up there. I think our athletes
have seen what it's going to take.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also no argument that the ECAC has never been stronger,
with Providence coach Jackie Barto seeming to speak for everyone
when she predicts, ``It's going to be as competitive a league as
I've ever seen.'' Gone are the days when one star player, one solid
line, and a good goalie made for a No. 1 team. According to USA
Hockey, the number of girls' and women's teams jumped from 149 in
1990-91 to 1,071 in 1997-98, and a surge like that can't help but
deepen the talent pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Harvard can get three Olympians and everyone else is still
happy with their freshman recruiting class, that says something,''
said Linstad.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even more change is on the horizon. Until now, the
Northeast has been the first and last chapter in women's collegiate
hockey: Witness the fact that of 20 US Olympians, all 18 who played
college hockey did so in the ECAC. That won't be the case in 2002.
Thanks to both Title IX and the general growth of participation and
interest in the sport by both genders, several schools in the
hockey-mad Midwest _ most notably Minnesota, which became varsity
last year, and the University of Wisconsin, which will do so next
year _ have gotten in on the act.
</P>
<P>
   They've brought their wallets with them. In the ECAC, only UNH,
Providence, St. Lawrence, Maine, and Niagara offer scholarships for
women's hockey, and the latter two are new to the conference this
year. Minnesota, Wisconsin, and several other Big Ten schools
currently mulling whether to elevate their club sports to varsity
status will be able to dangle scholarship bait when trying to hook
recruits. Add to that the chance to play closer to home _ Minnesota
has the biggest girls' high school program in the country _ and
Midwest colleges will soon be siphoning off homegrown talent that
used to look East.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Olympic standout Karyn Bye, a native of River
Falls, Wis., would undoubtedly have had her pick of Minnesota or
Wisconsin had those schools played varsity women's hockey when she
began college in 1989. Instead, she packed up for UNH.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the call of home has lured UNH standout Winny Brodt
back to Minnesota, which also kept Schmidgall down on the farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe what will happen over the next 20 years to women's
hockey is what happened to men's hockey 20 years ago,'' said Digit
Murphy, coach at perennial powerhouse Brown. ``Twenty years ago,
(the men's team here) was at the top of the NCAA. With the
inception of scholarships, you may see a substantial drop in the
performance of ECAC institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   It may not take that long, even though the lure of the
academically prestigious Ivies will always be a factor. Minnesota
already has shown, said Murphy, that it can ``really do some damage
in a short time.'' And Canada, which operates on a club rather than
college system, is already sending down what Murphy terms a ton of
players. Scholarships should attract even more, especially to
colleges along the border such as the University of
Minnesota-Duluth, which will debut a varsity team next season led
by former Canadian Olympic coach Shannon Miller.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of the sport, geographic and otherwise, is
demonstrated in many ways. Last season, for instance, marked the
first time a women's All-America team was selected, the birth of
the Patty Kazmaier Award (equivalent to the men's Hobey Baker) to
the national player of the year, and the advent of a national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   That four-team tournament, won by UNH, was played under the
auspices of the American Women's College Hockey Alliance because
the NCAA still considers women's ice hockey an emerging sport.
Before the NCAA will sponsor a national championship, a sport must
have 40 teams playing at the varsity level for at least two years;
with hockey reaching that milestone number this fall, an NCAA
tournament should begin by the 2000-2001 season, and there is a
move afoot to push for one even earlier.
</P>
<P>
   And, thanks in large part to the US triumph in Nagano, fan
interest is expected to reach new heights. After the Olympics,
``our attendance went up significantly,'' said Dot Sheehan,
associate director for external relations at UNH. ``Where we would
draw a crowd of 500, all of a sudden, we were up to four figures.''
Just four years ago, she said, a game might draw 50 spectators.
</P>
<P>
   While the Olympic glow and a national championship have
assuredly helped, marketing has played a role. A ``stick girl''
promotion lets a young girl from the community become part of the
team for a game, getting her own locker, sitting on the bench,
wearing a jersey with her name on it. And for the second season,
UNH has combined its schedule card and its season ticket
application for men's and women's hockey, with fans who buy season
tickets to watch the men getting three free women's games to give
them a look-see at the product.
</P>
<P>
   At Niagara, which beat Boston College twice to start the ECAC
season last weekend in its first varsity games ever, there was no
shortage of enthusiastic folks coming out to watch, reports BC
coach Tom O'Malley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bus pulled into the parking lot on Saturday and people
were tailgating,'' he said. ``It was unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   And Thursday at Minnesota, Harvard was to play in front of an
estimated 3,000 fans and a cable TV audience.
</P>
<P>
   All that paints such a rosy picture that Murphy is prompted to
declare, ``Even if some of the programs suffer in the ECAC, mine
included, if hockey as a whole grows, women's athletics benefits.''

SCIENTISTS DON'T AGREE ON GLOBAL WARMING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: www.oism.org/pproject is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Under way in Buenos Aires is a giant international conference on
global warming, a follow-up to last December's United
Nations-sponsored confab in Kyoto, Japan. Delegates to the summit
aim to put teeth into the treaty that came out of Kyoto, which
calls for the world's leading countries to sharply reduce their use
of energy over the next decade and a half. If implemented, the
treaty would force the most productive societies on earth _ the
ones that have led the way in making human life comfortable, safe,
and prosperous _ to slow their economic growth and degrade their
standard of living.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers of the Buenos Aires conference take it for
granted, of course, that global warming is real. The ``consensus''
among scientists, it is said, is that the planet's temperature is
rising, the cause of the rise is the use of fossil fuels, and
disastrous climate changes are looming unless drastic changes are
made. The media likewise tend to take it as a given that the
experts are in accord on global warming. So do many politicians.
``The evidence of global warming keeps piling up,'' says Vice
President Al Gore, who has made the issue a personal crusade,
``month after month, week after week.''
</P>
<P>
   So if the scientists are all in agreement, who said this?
</P>
<P>
   ``We urge the United States government to reject the global
warming agreement that was written in Kyoto. ... The proposed
limits on greenhouse gases would harm the environment, hinder the
advance of science and technology, and damage the health and
welfare of mankind.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release
of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gases is causing
(or will in the foreseeable future cause) catastrophic heating of
the Earth's atmosphere and disruption of the Earth's climate.
Moreover, there (itals)is(unitals) substantial scientific evidence
that increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide produce many
beneficial effects upon the natural plant and animal environments
of the Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   The carping of an oil-industry flack? The ignorant mutterings of
fringe anti-environmentalists?
</P>
<P>
   No. It is a petition signed by nearly 17,000 US scientists, half
of whom are trained in the fields of physics, geophysics, climate
science, meteorology, oceanography, chemistry, biology, or
biochemistry. The statement was circulated by the Oregon Institute
of Science and Medicine, along with an eight-page abstract of the
latest research on climate change. The abstract _ written for
scientists but comprehensible by laymen _ concludes that there is
no basis for believing (1) that atmospheric CO2 is causing a
dangerous climb in global temperatures, (2) that greater
concentrations of CO2 would be harmful, or (3) that human activity
leads to global warming in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The cover letter accompanying the petition and abstract was
penned by Frederick Seitz, a past president of the National Academy
of Sciences. (All these documents are available online at
www.oism.org/pproject.) The scientific ``consensus'' on global
warming, it turns out, does not exist.
</P>
<P>
   The Oregon Institute petition is no anomaly.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 climate scientists have endorsed the Leipzig
Declaration, which describes the Kyoto treaty as ``dangerously
simplistic, quite ineffective, and economically destructive.'' The
endorsers include prominent scholars, among them David Aubrey of
the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute; Larry Brace of NASA's
Goddard Space Flight Center; meteorologist Austin Hogan, who
co-edits the journal Atmospheric Research; Richard Lindzen, the
Sloane Professor of Meteorology at MIT; and Patrick Michaels, a
University of Virginia professor and past president of the American
Association of State Climatologists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dire predictions of a future warming have not been
validated by the historic climate record,'' the Leipzig Declaration
says bluntly. ``In fact, most climate specialists now agree that
actual observations from both weather satellites and balloon-borne
radiosondes show no current warming whatsoever _ in direct
contradiction to computer model results.'' The declaration, plus a
wealth of information on every aspect of the global warming
controversy, is posted at the Web site of the Science &AMP;
Environmental Policy Project, -www.sepp.org.
</P>
<P>
   What is going on in Buenos Aires is a costly exercise in
futility. The United States has not signed the Kyoto treaty; even
if President Clinton does sign it, there is no chance the Senate
will ratify it. And without US participation, any plan to curtail
CO2 emissions is doomed _ as it ought to be.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it is important to explode the myth that most
scientists are worried about global warming. Politicians shouldn't
be permitted to hijack science in their pursuit of power.
Environmentalists and journalists with an antibusiness itch to
scratch should be cross-examined whenever they claim there is only
one side to an issue of public policy.
</P>
<P>
   We've been down this ``consensus'' road before. Remember when
the Chicken Littles were warning that the earth was getting
(itals)colder(unitals)? ``The evidence in support of predictions
(of global cooling) has now begun to accumulate so massively,''
Newsweek claimed in 1975, ``that meteorologists are hard-pressed to
keep up with it.'' Except that there was no global cooling. The
alarmists were wrong then. They're wrong now.

OUR RATING: 3 1/2 STARS

<P>
   So you think Clinton is a criminal? Think Prince Charles is too
creepy to be king?
</P>
<P>
   These guys are Boy Scouts compared to Queen Elizabeth I. And
amateurs, if the calculating and ruthless monarch of ``Elizabeth''
is at all an accurate depiction. Designed like a mob movie and
capricious, in a very smart way, with presumed history, it's a
wised-up, very modern look at politics of the most pragmatic and
wicked sort.
</P>
<P>
   Written by historian Michael Hirst and directed by Shekhar
Kapur, who made the furiously energetic Indian film ``Bandit
Queen,'' ``Elizabeth'' may shock those who hold a dainty view of
things royal. If you're familiar with the War of the Roses; the
divorce-by-decapitation policy of Elizabeth's dad, Henry VIII; or
at least, ``Braveheart,'' you won't be too surprised to learn that
the Virgin Queen secured her throne atop a heap of deceptions,
strong-arm tactics and assassinations.
</P>
<P>
   The debatable concept here is that Elizabeth was not a virgin,
but had to become one in order to command the respect of the many
men who threatened her power. Maybe true, maybe not, but the idea
makes for fascinating contemporary resonances. Any woman (and
probably a lot of men) who has ever had to choose between love or
family and career will relate.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all of this would be quite too theoretical if it
wasn't presented in the context of a witty, lusty, ripping good
thriller. Focusing on the years just before and after the
25-year-old Elizabeth was crowned in 1558, the film has more palace
and romantic intrigues than the Tower of London has jewels.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth is played by the smart Australian actress Cate
Blanchett, who was so impressive as the feminist Victorian gambler
in ``Oscar and Lucinda.'' As that film proved, despite her delicate
features, Blanchett can assume a sublime poker face _ and that more
than anything is the key to Elizabeth's ascendance here.
</P>
<P>
   We first see her as a young woman in love with the dashing
Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester (Joseph Fiennes, Ralph's
less-brooding brother). But she's also worried, and for good
reason. Her resentful, pitiful half-sister, Queen Mary (Kathy
Burke), is forcibly trying to move England back into the Catholic
fold, and as Anne Boleyn's daughter, Elizabeth is not only the
living symbol of the Protestant break, she's a stubborn supporter
of the Church of England.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth survives a stint in the Tower to succeed Bloody Mary,
but her position is shaky. Mary of Guise (Fanny Ardant), the
French-born queen of Scotland, is moving south with a formidable
army. Many of the young queen's own nobles, led by the shifty Duke
of Norfolk (Christopher Eccleston), are actively sabotaging the
crown's cause, both on the field of battle and closer to home.
Meanwhile, the Pope (John Gielgud, enjoying himself immensely) has
essentially taken out a hit on the red-haired upstart.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth relies on a series of male figures to guide her
through this labyrinth of treachery. There's Dudley, of course,
though he's hiding something. Then there's the well-meaning,
fatherly Sir William Cecil (Richard Attenborough), who knows the
ins and outs of marriage-based diplomacy but doesn't have the
imagination to keep up with Elizabeth's exponentially expanding
shrewdness. The guy who does get her _ and who can nudge her to the
next levels _ is Sir Francis Walsingham (``Shine's'' Geoffrey
Rush), a kind of 16th-century combination of Henry Kissinger, James
Carville and Michael Corleone.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Elizabeth herself who ultimately decides who she can
and cannot trust, what hands to play and when, and, most
poignantly, what the once-happy girl has to sacrifice in order to
survive and rule effectively. Some steps of this evolution seem
skipped _ she shifts too abruptly from nervous and naive to
confident and commanding in a couple of scenes. But the overall
growth arc is fascinating to watch, often because Blanchett makes
us feel the loss of what must be left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Employing great stone castles for all their unsettling
clamminess, Kapur maintains an tense tone through a wide range of
incidents that involve everything from a poisoned dress to a
cross-dressing suitor. Whirligig, disorienting camerawork gradually
gives way to more settled coverage as Elizabeth grows to master the
daunting complications of her situation.
</P>
<P>
   The film ultimately makes a compelling case for at least keeping
the ``Was she or wasn't she?'' question open. Well-judged; to be
more insistent would simply not have been proper.

FOUR REASONS WHY HARSHBARGER LOST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a winnable race. When Representative Joe Kennedy dropped
out in September 1997, Attorney General Scott Harshbarger's road to
victory opened up like a freeway. Rarely has a non-incumbent
Democratic gubernatorial candidate in Massachusetts had 12 months
to put the pieces together for the final seven-week sprint to
election night. Yet, on a Democratic night in a Democratic state,
the pieces didn't quite come together.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger lost to Republican Acting Governor Paul Cellucci for
four reasons. First, he brought a negative message to a positive
electorate. Second, he failed to give voters a clear idea of what
he intended to do. Third, he offered no positive context for
Cellucci's retirement. Fourth, his campaign was premised on what
``should'' be done, not on what ``might'' be possible. Look at them
one at a time.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to unseat a reasonably popular incumbent governor
presiding during prosperous economic times. An election day voter
poll conducted by Voter News Service showed Massachusetts voters
fairly ecstatic over the current status of the local economy.
Twelve percent described it as excellent; 75 percent good. That's a
a combined positive rating of 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half of the voters in Massachusetts described their
present financial situation as better than before. One in 10 voters
described it as worse. All others said their financial situation
was more or less the same. In a majority of those cases, the
financial situation they described was a cut above the national
average. The mood of the Massachusetts electorate could hardly have
been more buoyant.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci had a simple message. He argued, credibly, that
Massachusetts in 1998 was a much better place to live and work than
it was when he and Governor Weld took office in 1990. He argued,
credibly, that he had been a key player in the improvement of the
state's economic climate. And he argued, not incredibly, that
returning Massachusetts to one-party government might threaten all
that had been gained.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's message made it imperative that Harshbarger be clear
about his intentions. Harshbarger's failure to outline a
substantive agenda that built upon the success of the Weld-Cellucci
years was perhaps his most crucial campaign mistake. ``Labor's
agenda is my agenda'' was meaningless, if not threatening, to an
electorate that is gainfully employed by or dependent upon four key
economic sectors: academe, high technology, financial services, and
health care. ``Labor's agenda is my agenda'' turned out to be the
Harshbarger campaign's only memorable line.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger compounded this problem by running an unrelentingly
negative general election campaign. His television advertising was
hostile in tone and substance. His behavior in the final two
debates was rude. He all but demanded that the electorate fire
Cellucci for dereliction of duty.
</P>
<P>
   The electorate was willing to entertain the idea of removing
Cellucci; as the closeness of the final results made plain. But
they were not of a mind to punish him. Harshbarger would have been
far better advised to adopt what political consultants call the
``gold watch'' strategy, which allows voters to retire an incumbent
without rejecting him.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of the gold watch campaign is that it forces one's
opponent to prove a negative. Had Harshbarger employed it, Cellucci
would have had to explain why his administration was still fresh,
why his team was every bit as good as the first team under Weld,
why his ``third'' term wouldn't dissipate as every other third term
in Massachusetts politics had. The onus of getting specific would
have fallen upon the incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   But Harshbarger was unwilling to offer any appreciation of
Cellucci's service (or Weld's, for that matter) and so insisted
that voters reject Cellucci outright. This, they were unwilling to
do. Cellucci, whatever his faults, has been an honorable public
servant in Massachusetts for more than two decades. His peers like
him personally and have respect for his political abilities. Voters
give him good marks because the results have been tangible. And his
personal shortcomings are widely shared. He is not the only person
in Massachusetts paying down MasterCard.
</P>
<P>
   By never giving Cellucci his due, Harshbarger turned victory
into defeat. In so doing, he joined scores of other attorneys
general who, over the years, have failed to become governor.
Attorneys general are famously bad candidates because they think
legally instead of politically. That's fine if you're prosecuting
felons, but campaigns aren't cases.
</P>
<P>
   Politics is generous, not precise. Politics is about maybe, not
certainties. Paul Cellucci, against a high Democratic tide,
understood from the beginning what Scott Harshbarger did not. You
won't win because you should. You will because you might.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The creative forces behind the new political
thriller ``The Siege'' have their hearts in the right place, but
then they make the mistake of opening their mouths. Again and again
and again.
</P>
<P>
   For about 40 minutes, the film works as a tense, interesting
cat-and-mouse chase between FBI agent Denzel Washington and Arab
terrorists intent on reducing the number of tourist attractions in
New York. Then the film widens its scope and becomes a preachy and
predictable action movie that embraces genre cliches and ethnic
stereotypes with equal fervor. In the end, the real siege is waged
upon your patience. You won't have much left when this
disappointing movie ends.

   Ed Zwick, who directed ``The Siege'' and co-wrote it with
magazine writer Lawrence Wright and Menno Meyjes, means for the
film to be an intriguing look at the thin line that exists between
the civil rights of an individual and the principles of a free
society. But Zwick craves spectacle, too, and he never quite finds
the comfort zone between ideas and explosions. He doesn't offer
much in the way of new insights either, so ultimately, it's his
movie, not New York, that goes boom.
</P>
<P>
   Washington plays Anthony Hubbard, a moral dynamo of an FBI agent
assigned to investigate terrorist bomb threats. Together with his
Arab-American partner, Frank Haddad (Tony Shalhoub) and a team of
agents, Hubbard tries to find the bombers before they make good on
their promises. Helping (and often confounding) them is a CIA
operative (Annette Bening) who sheds identities almost as fast as
she discards her clothes when she thinks it will help her cause.
</P>
<P>
   When the terrorist attacks continue, the government panics and
martial law is declared. Tanks roll across the Brooklyn Bridge and
a no-nonsense general (Bruce Willis) uses his power as an excuse to
round up Arab-Americans (seemingly anyone with a two-day beard) and
toss them into makeshift internment camps.
</P>
<P>
   This leads to a lot of hokey speeches about freedom and the
Constitution, a ridiculous gun-pointing ending and a speech by
Willis that seems cribbed from the one Jack Nicholson made at the
end of ``A Few Good Men.'' Except, of course, that Willis is no
Jack Nicholson and the speech, as written, sounds as if it should
come from Gomer Pyle, not a two-star general.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Siege'' has drawn a lot of criticism from Arab and
Muslim-American rights groups, and, to a point, you can see why
they're upset. The film makes precious little distinction between
Arabs and Muslims and perpetuates the stereotypes that link Islam
and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   But then, ``The Siege'' also stereotypes the military as a bunch
of head-bashing, door-smashing goons and even seems to go after
Bill Clinton as the man indirectly responsible for all sorts of
civil rights violations. (We're waiting for the Rush Limbaugh
rave.) The movie features stock footage of Clinton decrying
terrorist activities and later we see (fictional) presidential
advisers clamoring for martial law. Next thing you know, it's World
War II all over again, only it's Arab-Americans and not
Japanese-Americans being fitted for prison garb. (``I feel your
pain ... and then inflict some more.'')
</P>
<P>
   It's another half-baked idea in a movie that's full of them and
full of itself.

LOOSE DOOR FRAMES NEED RENAILING

<P>
   Q. The doors in my prefab ranch work quite well. They close OK,
open OK, and latch OK. But the frames around the openings are
coming away from the walls. When I renail, they just come loose
again. They all seem loose. What's wrong and how can I fix it?
</P>
<P>
   PAULA FERREIRA, Haverhill, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It's my guess that what's wrong is that the nails going into
the frames (casing) are not hitting solid wood, but rather are
going into the plasterboard wall, which will not hold anything.
There should be at least a doubled stud on each side of the opening
where the doors are, allowing the casing to be secured by nailing.
Or, at least a single stud, but in standard construction, studs are
doubled on each side of a door opening. Another possibility is that
the nails were driven near the outer edge of the casing boards,
missing the studs altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The cure is to nail in the middle of the casing boards, not at
the outer sides, making sure the nail bites into wood; you can tell
when you drive the nail.
</P>
<P>
   One more thing: Also nail near the inner side of the casing
board and at a slight angle so the nail goes into the edge of the
side jamb. (The side jamb is the board actually in the opening; the
door hinges are attached to one side jamb, the latch on the other.)
</P>
<P>
   And, if the prefab house is less than a year old (within
warranty), get the manufacturer to fix these errors.
</P>
<P>
   If these procedures don't work, you can always glue the casing
on with an adhesive caulk, or construction adhesive. Liquid Nails
is a popular construction adhesive that comes in a caulking
cartridge, allowing easy application of the adhesive from a
caulking gun.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a gas stove top, which works fine except that when I
open the cabinet door under it, the pilot goes out. How can I
prevent that? Also, I painted my furniture, and now everything
sticks to it, despite the paint having been left to dry for several
days. How can I unstick that paint?
</P>
<P>
   NANCY ROGERSON, Framingtham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Call the gas company or one of the new gas appliance
companies to see if one or the other could make a modification to
prevent this. Obviously, when you open the door you are pulling air
out of the cabinet, making enough of a breeze to put out the pilot.
For starters, open the door slowly, but you shouldn't have to do
that to accommodate a defective device, or at best a poorly
designed one. Actually, the open door may create enough of a draft
to put out the pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Or, put a piece of plywood at the top of the cabinet, covering
it completely; it would be below the stove top unit, but it might
prevent that draft when the door is open.
</P>
<P>
   Another alternative is to install a stove top with electronic
ignition.
</P>
<P>
   The furniture paint job might have become sticky if a primer was
not used, or if you used old paint. To fix it, sand the paint as
thoroughly as possible, wash with paint thinner, apply a thin coat
of latex enamel undercoat, and finish off with eggshell finish
latex paint or indoor-outdoor oil enamel.

THE LINE ON BRAIN ORIENTATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Figuring out how our children's brains work is not something
most of us give much thought to. Things might be different if your
son or daughter were in Mary Eastwood's fifth-grade class at
South/East Elementary School in Hingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood is one of a small but growing contingent of educators
who believe that knowing the unique way each child receives and
processes information improves learning. Every year about this
time, she teaches about the brain, and she talks about it to
parents during conferences, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say a child is very auditory and tends to take in
information from what she hears,'' says Eastwood. ``What if she's
got a teacher who primarily conveys information on
</P>
<P>
   the board or through written material? That child's going to
feel lost. She's going to begin to feel like she's stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   With problems like this, the tendency these days is to think
disability _ learning, behavioral, or attentional -- when it may be
something much simpler: the predisposition we all have to favor a
particular way for processing information that translates into our
individual learning style.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the bane of every math teacher, the child who can
intuitively solve a complicated word problem but can't write out
how he did it. This child likely has an orientation to the brain's
right hemisphere, says educator and researcher Jane M. Healy. She
calls a person like this a ``lumper,'' someone who sees things
visually as a whole, often in pictorial images, but who doesn't
focus on details, hence ``lumps them all together.'' A
``splitter,'' on the other hand, has a left-brain orientation and
loves details. ``She splits information into little pieces and puts
them in order to build the big picture,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   These distinctions are often described as right brain versus
left brain with the assumption that a person is either one or the
other. That's far too simplistic, according to researchers, and
leads parents and teachers to such erroneous conclusions as,
``Johnny can't learn this because he's left/right brained.''
</P>
<P>
   Picture a fast-paced game of table tennis and you get a better
idea of how the brain works, with connections zinging back and
forth from one hemisphere to the other, across the corpus callosum,
the brain's center. At the same time, though, there's a built-in
preference that pushes one person to be more receptive to
information through words, details, and logic and another through
images, concepts, and deduction.
</P>
<P>
   Parents can see this even when children are young, says
educational consultant Linda Verlee Williams, author of ``Teaching
for the Two-Sided Mind'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster). A toddler who has
difficulty with transitions and does better with lots of structure
probably has a left-hemisphere orientation while a flexible child
may have a right-brain orientation.
</P>
<P>
   With very young children, parents and teachers need patience to
cater to individual differences rather than expect a child to
adapt. ``If you have a 3-year-old who seems to ignore what you tell
her, consider that you're auditory and he's not. Talk less,''
suggests Williams. ``Find other ways to communicate, use drawings,
both yours and hers: `Can you draw me a picture of what you
think/how you feel?'''
</P>
<P>
   As children get older, the idea is to begin to stretch them.
Otherwise, they get stuck in a learning-style rut, says
developmental psychologist Beth Casey of Boston College. By seventh
grade, a lumper, for instance, may get bad grades not because he's
slow but because he lacks organizational skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does the homework and as long as the papers are in the the
binder, he's satisfied; he's not worried about the details of where
they are,'' says Eastwood. ``But when it's time to hand them in, he
can't find them.''
</P>
<P>
   This child needs organizational support that feeds to his
strength: ``Picture in your mind what your room/binder/desk would
look like if it were neat. OK, now let's figure out what we can do
to make it look like that.''
</P>
<P>
   A splitter, on the other hand, may never lose a paper, but give
her an essay to write and, without pieces to support a structure,
she doesn't know where to begin. The help she needs is learning how
to gather the pieces together, perhaps by making a list of words or
ideas that become her building blocks.
</P>
<P>
   One theory gaining momentum among educators is that rigid
compartmentalization can be avoided if we encourage young children
in big- and small-picture thinking, says Casey. She has a National
Science Foundation grant to help kindergartners use both spatial
and verbal thinking skills.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you can identify a child's predisposition or not, make
sure she gets a balance of experiences. All young children need
support to think purposefully _ ``What's your plan? What do you
need to do first?' _ as well as globally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Provide opportunities to think in three-dimensional space,''
says Casey. ``Give them Legos and construction material, do
carpentry with them, build a fort.'' Stretching intuitive
visualization skills may be especially helpful for young girls who
tend in later years to be less likely than boys to use spatial
skills to solve math problems.
</P>
<P>
   Casey says the goal is to enable every child be able to draw on
both systems of thinking with ease so they can decode in multiple
ways. In a world that throws information at us from a myriad of
media, these skills can be a matter of survival.
</P>
<P>
   Also gaining momentum among teachers is what educator Susan
Barrett calls brain-compatible learning. Barrett is author of a
book for children, ``It's All in Your Head: A Guide to
Understanding Your Brain'' (Free Spirit Publishing).
</P>
<P>
   For decades, she says, the emphasis in classrooms has favored
the left-hemisphere-oriented child who is good at memorizing dates
and math facts. Williams knows firsthand how destructive that can
be. Nearly 20 years ago when her daughter was in third grade, Erin
became convinced she was stupid. ``She didn't have a learning
disability or ADD, just a teacher with a traditional focus that
involved memorizing books. My daughter wasn't linear,'' says
Williams. ``She was miserable.''
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the year, Williams moved her to an experimental
school that valued divergent thinking. In weeks, Erin was doing
higher level work than she had done before. ``It was easy for her
when she was allowed to work from her strengths,'' says Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Erin would not have had trouble in Eastwood's class. Last week,
as students learned that what comes easily to one child may be
difficult for another and vice versa because of the way the brain
works and not because someone is more or less smart, Eastwood could
see students sighing in relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see a new respect and tolerance for each other,'' she says.
``We also see kids willing to work harder. Instead of saying, `I'm
stupid, I can't learn this,' a child is more likely to say, `I can
do this, I just have to work more at it.''' Indeed, it's not
uncommon for a student to tell her, ``This is hard for me because I
have to cross over and use the abilities of my right brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood frequently gives choices in homework so some children
can come at an assignment in a parts-to-whole approach and others
whole-to-parts. She also varies her teaching style to accommodate
differences in learning styles. In a recent language arts lesson on
subject and predicate, she first defined the terms and gave
students sentences to work. Then she had children out of their
seats, improvising a dance in which some were subjects and some
were predicates.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _Talk to your child about learning style differences. Just being
aware of them can be helpful to him.
</P>
<P>
   _Offer emotional support to a child who struggles with a
learning-style difference: ``I can see how hard this is for you.''
Avoid statements like, ``Why can't you do this?''
</P>
<P>
   _If a child has a hard time with a writing assignment, encourage
him to act it out with his body _ ``What do you think that person
would walk like?'' _ or to draw or find pictures of emotions:
``Find me a picture in a magazine that shows anger. What words
describe this picture?''
</P>
<P>
   _Not all teachers think about learning styles. Be aware of the
fit between the teacher and your child and talk about it with the
teacher: ``You seem to be someone who prefers written materials.
How does that fit with Amy's learning style?''
</P>
<P>
   _Some children are holistic learners and do not have a built-in
preference for one hemisphere. All learners _ left-, right-, and
holistic-oriented _ are capable of learning equally well.
</P>
<P>
   _Any child who is miserable and struggling in school may benefit
from professional help. Always start with the teacher and school
guidance counselor.

   So you think Clinton is a criminal? Think Prince Charles is too
creepy to be king?
</P>
<P>
   These guys are Boy Scouts compared to Queen Elizabeth I. And
amateurs, if the calculating and ruthless monarch of ``Elizabeth''
is at all an accurate depiction. Designed like a mob movie and
capricious, in a very smart way, with presumed history, it's a
wised-up, very modern look at politics of the most pragmatic and
wicked sort.
</P>
<P>
   Written by historian Michael Hirst and directed by Shekhar
Kapur, who made the furiously energetic Indian film ``Bandit
Queen,'' ``Elizabeth'' may shock those who hold a dainty view of
things royal. If you're familiar with the War of the Roses; the
divorce-by-decapitation policy of Elizabeth's dad, Henry VIII; or
at least, ``Braveheart,'' you won't be too surprised to learn that
the Virgin Queen secured her throne atop a heap of deceptions,
strong-arm tactics and assassinations.
</P>
<P>
   The debatable concept here is that Elizabeth was not a virgin,
but had to become one in order to command the respect of the many
men who threatened her power. Maybe true, maybe not, but the idea
makes for fascinating contemporary resonances. Any woman (and
probably a lot of men) who has ever had to choose between love or
family and career will relate.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all of this would be quite too theoretical if it
wasn't presented in the context of a witty, lusty, ripping good
thriller. Focusing on the years just before and after the
25-year-old Elizabeth was crowned in 1558, the film has more palace
and romantic intrigues than the Tower of London has jewels.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth is played by the smart Australian actress Cate
Blanchett, who was so impressive as the feminist Victorian gambler
in ``Oscar and Lucinda.'' As that film proved, despite her delicate
features, Blanchett can assume a sublime poker face _ and that more
than anything is the key to Elizabeth's ascendance here.
</P>
<P>
   We first see her as a young woman in love with the dashing
Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester (Joseph Fiennes, Ralph's
less-brooding brother). But she's also worried, and for good
reason. Her resentful, pitiful half-sister, Queen Mary (Kathy
Burke), is forcibly trying to move England back into the Catholic
fold, and as Anne Boleyn's daughter, Elizabeth is not only the
living symbol of the Protestant break, she's a stubborn supporter
of the Church of England.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth survives a stint in the Tower to succeed Bloody Mary,
but her position is shaky. Mary of Guise (Fanny Ardant), the
French-born queen of Scotland, is moving south with a formidable
army. Many of the young queen's own nobles, led by the shifty Duke
of Norfolk (Christopher Eccleston), are actively sabotaging the
crown's cause, both on the field of battle and closer to home.
Meanwhile, the Pope (John Gielgud, enjoying himself immensely) has
essentially taken out a hit on the red-haired upstart.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth relies on a series of male figures to guide her
through this labyrinth of treachery. There's Dudley, of course,
though he's hiding something. Then there's the well-meaning,
fatherly Sir William Cecil (Richard Attenborough), who knows the
ins and outs of marriage-based diplomacy but doesn't have the
imagination to keep up with Elizabeth's exponentially expanding
shrewdness. The guy who does get her _ and who can nudge her to the
next levels _ is Sir Francis Walsingham (``Shine's'' Geoffrey
Rush), a kind of 16th-century combination of Henry Kissinger, James
Carville and Michael Corleone.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Elizabeth herself who ultimately decides who she can
and cannot trust, what hands to play and when, and, most
poignantly, what the once-happy girl has to sacrifice in order to
survive and rule effectively. Some steps of this evolution seem
skipped _ she shifts too abruptly from nervous and naive to
confident and commanding in a couple of scenes. But the overall
growth arc is fascinating to watch, often because Blanchett makes
us feel the loss of what must be left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Employing great stone castles for all their unsettling
clamminess, Kapur maintains an tense tone through a wide range of
incidents that involve everything from a poisoned dress to a
cross-dressing suitor. Whirligig, disorienting camerawork gradually
gives way to more settled coverage as Elizabeth grows to master the
daunting complications of her situation.
</P>
<P>
   The film ultimately makes a compelling case for at least keeping
the ``Was she or wasn't she?'' question open. Well-judged; to be
more insistent would simply not have been proper.

STRANGE LOVE AFFAIR BETWEEN A MAN, MANHATTAN

OUR RATING: 3 STARS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Timothy ``Speed'' Levitch is in love. Madly,
unreasonably, to the exclusion of what most people would call
common sense, in love.
</P>
<P>
   But, alas, he's in love with a harsh mistress. New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cruise'' is a fascinating, informative documentary about a
strange and compelling guy whose passion for everything about
Manhattan is infectious.
</P>
<P>
   And something of a disease.
</P>
<P>
   Levitch barely made a living narrating Gray Line, double-decker
bus tours of the city (and, when that stopped, leading walking
tours). His spiels, shot through with theatricality, ironic humor
and an encyclopedic knowledge of historical and architectural
minutiae, were a scream.
</P>
<P>
   In black-and-white video, director-photographer Bennett Miller
captured enough of these outlandish performances to make anyone
long for a Levitch tour. The film is also an examination of the man
and his semi-mystical philosophy of cruising, what he considers a
kind of living interaction with the city he loves.
</P>
<P>
   These riffs are amusingly eccentric, but as more details of
Levitch's life accumulate, we fear that this very smart and
talented man may be more than a little demented. We discover he has
no fixed address, that he's made his way through the New York
criminal justice system and, during a remarkable series of rants on
the Brooklyn Bridge, that he harbors deep resentments toward a long
list of people he feels have done him wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Levitch is such a natural performer, so given to
dramatizing and satirizing everything he says, it's often hard to
tell whether he's becoming seriously unhinged or just pretending
to.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his true mental state, Levitch's gift for rhapsodic
description is a joy to experience. He can speed-recite which great
author wrote what, and how he was probably thinking at the time, in
any of a dozen buildings passed in the length of a two-block hop
through Greenwich Village. Often comparing the city to a woman and
terra cotta to lovemaking, he fires every cruise with a sense of
sensuous life.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bennett's filming technique is unavoidably verite and
rough, some of his images, like Levitch gazing skyward between the
World Trade Center towers, say as much about the rapture of city
life as any of Speed's monologues.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, you've got to admire Levitch's passion, and indeed
his cussed individualism. He's very much a mad prophet in search of
believers, but while he may never find a convert to his tenuous,
exultant existence, he does a valuable service by making us
appreciate things we'd otherwise pass right by without a second
thought.

PUNDITS AMONG THE LOSERS IN ELECTION

   &UR;  &LR; According to the Political Hotline electronic newsletter, not
one commentator predicted what people ended up doing in the voting
booth on Tuesday. Tuesday's Hotline listed 34 ``chattering class''
prognostications by assorted pundits _ from Bob Novak to George
Stephanopoulos. And who came closest to projecting the Democratic
gains in the House? A 10th-grade class at Montgomery Blair High
School in Silver Spring, Md. ``Out of the mouths of babes,'' notes
Hotline editor Craig Crawford.

<P>
   _The media moment of the election came on Wednesday's ``Today''
show, when Katie Couric asked House Speaker Newt Gingrich whether
he interpreted the vote as a repudiation of the Republicans'
fixation with the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Without missing a beat,
Gingrich pointed out that it was the media, not politicians, who
were obsessed with the story and singled out NBC's ``Meet the
Press'' host Tim Russert as a prime example. Gingrich's response
may have been a tad coy. But one does wonder how Russert _ who has
positively devoured Monica-gate _ could deliver election-night
commentary on the public's apparent indifference to the scandal
with a straight face.

   _One loser on Tuesday was The (Manchester, N.H.) Union Leader,
which took what many observers considered an 11th-hour cheap shot
at a state Senate candidate. Only a week before Election Day, the
paper published a story trying to connect Democrat Rich Trombly to
a gay group involved in ``fetishes.'' Trombly, who was challenging
a Republican incumbent and who characterized the story an example
of ``gutter politics,'' won a narrow upset victory on Tuesday.

   Forget all that talk about the ``gender gap'' in Tuesday's
election. The real gender gap _ according to a survey of ABC, CBS,
and NBC evening newscasts for the first half of this year _
surfaces in the world of TV talking heads. The study, conducted by
analyst Andrew Tyndall for the Freedom Forum, discovered that a
whopping 87 percent of the ``expert'' sound bites on those news
programs were provided by men. And an even more overwhelming 92
percent of those sound bites were uttered by whites. ``The
networks' golden Rolodexes ... are badly in need of updating,''
says Tyndall.

HOT TICKET 
By Janice Weber 
Warner, 352 pp., $24 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frost the Fiddler is a hot ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Frost, the heroine of Janice Weber's popular 1992 spy
novel, is back, and she's up to her chin in trouble. The public
knows Frost as a glamour-puss violinist _ think Anne-Sophie Mutter,
leather pants, Harleys, an international tour schedule, broken
hearts in every civilized musical city, and invitations to play at
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   To one person, however, Frost is ``Smith,'' as in the college;
Frost is one of seven sister secret agents who work for Maxine, who
alone knows the details of their double lives. Only two of the
seven survive, and Barnard may be in trouble; in fact, Barnard is
dead in her Watergate apartment by the time Smith gets to her.
</P>
<P>
   There's a video floating around of Barnard in a compromising
bathtub situation with the president of the United States, and
there are sharks in the water along with the randy, cigar-smoking
chief executive. His wife, for one; the first lady is so perfect
that her shoes match her trademark bows in dress and hair, and her
eyes are as ``blue and lethal as prussic acid.'' There's also a
ruthless female senator with her eye on the prize and ``enough
hairspray to deflect an F-111''; the first lady's lesbian personal
assistant, who has spent too much time in the back of the bus with
the pizzas; a couple of wealthy and dangerous power brokers; an
international arms dealer; an ethnobotanist who is into developing
untraceable poisons in the rain forests of Belize. Frost finds
herself hanging from a balcony, hacking her way through the jungle,
avoiding death by poisonous snake, fighting for her life in a
raging river, researching dengue fever, tying up a villain with his
own polyester neckties, resisting the advances of the president,
achieving orgasm and getting married, visiting the grave of John
Philip Sousa, giving a violin lesson to a terrible little girl,
trolling through dives (``At least in Berlin the lesbians tried to
look like Marilyn Monroe instead of John Belushi''), playing a
Carnegie Hall recital, looking like a million bucks (``Bad choice,
this outfit. Should have worn a chador''), and keeping America safe
for democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hot Ticket'' is a little like one of those grand operatic
fantasias for piano that are a prominent part of the repertory of
author Janice Weber in her alternate life as a concert pianist. She
is not John le Carre or Charles McCarry writing about the gray and
lusterless world of real spies. Instead she spins virtuoso
variations on themes of the adventures of Hollywood and television
spies. Her plot is deliriously complicated, and believability isn't
the point _ it's a trick, like all those Lisztian passages meant to
sound as if three hands are playing the piano, and everything is
going a little too fast for comfort.
</P>
<P>
   The things that Janice Weber made up make ``Hot Ticket''
entertaining, if sometimes a bit exhausting to keep up with. The
things that she knows and feels are what make it memorable. Weber
knows that fireworks mean more when they explode and evaporate
above the context of familiar earthbound landmarks. Her inventions
have a way of anticipating reality _ she finished ``Hot Ticket''
before anyone had ever heard of Monica S. Lewinsky (though
President Clinton's reputation had preceded its full documentation
in the Starr report). Weber's done her research, so you can feel
the heat in this Belize, and you may wind up knowing more about
dengue fever than you want to. And anyone interested in music will
enjoy Weber's totally realistic take on the workings of the musical
world _ conductors, accompanists, agents, record companies,
publicists, audiences, life backstage, and the special ecstasy that
comes along with connection to your instrument, your colleagues,
and the music. The musical world also provides Weber with an
unexpected but effective murder weapon, and she must have enjoyed
the opportunity her plot offered her to eviscerate a critic after a
nasty review.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, there is the voice of wisecracking Leslie Frost.
There are more zingers per page than in most joke books, and almost
nothing is sacred _ not politics, not politicians, not bad hair
days, certainly not any human failing or sexual peccadillo. But
though Frost's eyes are as lethal as prussic acid, she's also an
incurable romantic. Chamber music is ``an exalted form of
foreplay'' and Frost starts to read through the Brahms G-Major
Sonata with the man she loves. ``I twined my notes around his and
rolled with him through a shaded vale that opens only to people
making music. ... I felt enclosed and protected. I had met so few,
so pitifully few, men who could rise to that minimal challenge.
They were the only ones worth going to the precipice for.'' Frost
does go to the precipice, goes over, crawls back _ and she is
indeed a hot ticket. But it's her low laughter, and not her
fireworks, that you won't forget.

GODZILLA A MONSTER TALENT?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Remember ``Ed Sullivan'' and all those popular
variety shows of the '50s and '60s? If you were lucky, you might
catch a great band (the Beatles, the Stones or the Doors), a
terrific comedian (Woody Allen or Richard Pryor), a highlight from
Broadway or the opera and even a wonderful juggling act.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, what you sometimes got was was a band like
the Strawberry Alarm Clock, a Borscht Belt comic heading for
oblivion and some guy sticking spoons to his forehead.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, though, it was a mixed bag. So you would sit
around and wait for the good parts while enduring the bad. The
something-for-everybody approach doesn't add up to much in terms of
content, but it could be diverting.
</P>
<P>
   Well, variety shows have faded, but the something-for-everybody
format is still around. All you have to do is look at the way
Hollywood creates its blockbusters. Take ``Godzilla'' (Sony), which
is out on video this week.
</P>
<P>
   It has action, a love story, comic relief and special effects.
Unfortunately, except for the special effects, the lineup is
definitely B material.
</P>
<P>
   ``Godzilla's'' love story revolves around heartbroken biologist
Nick Tatopoulos (Matthew Broderick) and Audrey (Maria Pitillo), a
wanna-be reporter. The relationship between these two wimps has as
much juice as a dead battery. The comic relief, for the most part,
comes down to French spies (don't ask) not being able to get a good
cup of coffee in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   As for action, ``Godzilla'' fares much better. The filmmakers,
Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich, know how to deliver slick, kinetic
scenes, but for the most part, there isn't much terror in them. And
isn't that what you go to ``Godzilla'' for? It is loud, though, as
if that's some kind of substitute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Godzilla'' does excel in special effects, however. Watching
the giant lizard weave its way among the skyscrapers of New York or
Godzilla's offspring scampering around Madison Square Garden is
fun. But that's about it.
</P>
<P>
   You've probably noticed that the word ``plot'' hasn't been
mentioned. That's because films like these don't worry about plots.
They are high concepts that scriptwriters and filmmakers try to
color in, and later when there are holes and implausibilities, they
just turn up the sound.
</P>
<P>
   Another blockbuster that recently hit the video stores _ ``Deep
Impact'' (Paramount) _ suffers from the same problems, only worse.
The comet-hits-the-Earth movie didn't even have a sense of humor.
It's sort of like watching a variety show made up of nothing but
juggling acts. Worst, it wasted the talents of several fine actors,
including Vanessa Redgrave and Robert Duvall, but especially Tea
Leoni, who's a wonderfully talented comic (rent ``Flirting With
Disaster'').
</P>
<P>
   But as long as people flock to theaters, we are likely to get
more of these films, which are put together to appeal to all
different demographics _ sort of like a variety show. Here's
something for the ladies, this is for the gents, and here's
something for the kiddies.
</P>
<P>
   A well-written, cohesive script doesn't seem to be part of the
formula. So, the movie-going experience has become much like the
variety-show-watching experience: You just wait for the parts you
like and tolerate the rest.
</P>
<P>
   WOODY, WOODY, WOODY
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people thought they got a glimpse of the real Woody
Allen in Barbara Kopple's ``Wild Man Blues'' (New Line), which is
also out on video this week. But the documentary about Allen's
18-city 1996 tour of Europe with his Dixieland-jazz band is not
especially hard-hitting or insightful. With the cameras following
him everywhere, Allen seems to slip into one of his film personas,
tossing out jokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Europeans like pictures that drone on, and I'm good at
making pictures that drone on,'' he says, explaining his popularity
on the Continent.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Kopple expected more, but Allen hardly turns out to be a
wild man. Nevertheless, Allen fans may want to check it out. &QL;

DULLI'S DAYS OF DARKNESS BRIGHTEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are some places Greg Dulli, songwriter-singer-guitarist of
the Afghan Whigs, chooses just not to go right now. Down the alley
of darkness would be one of those places. Professionally,
personally. With the Whigs lusty, bright-sounding new disc,
``1965,'' not out even two weeks yet, Dulli is starting to hear
some grumbling about those choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some fans have not liked the lack of darkness and even
expressed bitterness at a lighter view, and, maybe, even a sense of
humor at times,'' says Dulli, from his Seattle home. ``I guess it's
been a shock to their system. Anybody who's looking for sadness, I
mean look no further than your own heart. There is a soundtrack for
you somewhere. I just don't got it for you this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Dulli looks at ``1965'' this way: ``When someone paints and they
paint with bright colors for the first time, it's shocking. But if
you look closely _ and you don't even have to look that closely _
there's plenty of shadow in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Dulli has fronted the Afghan Whigs, which plays the Paradise
tomorrow, for 11 years. The most famous band to come out of
Cincinnati, the Whigs are fleshed out by guitarist Rick McCollum,
bassist John Curley, and drummer Michael Horrigan. Even though
Dulli is the main man, he stresses the band's unity: ``You can't
build a house without a strong foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   Afghan Whigs's harsh, hard sound hit during the heyday of grunge
and its last full-length effort, 1996's ``Black Love,'' was full of
pain and venom. ```Black Love' was, you know, black,'' says Dulli.
``I was going to run the risk of parody if went back that way. So
for better or worse, this is who I am right now. Life is a rich
pageant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Show some love for a brother,'' says Dulli, with a laugh.
``Let him have a happy day, man. And if you think I'm making bad
music now, don't listen to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dulli and the Whigs recorded ``1965'' in New Orleans at Daniel
Lanois's studio. The album's relatively upbeat, soulful mood, Dulli
suggests, came from the environment. ``I went down there 10 years
ago just to visit and it's the only place in the world I keep
coming back to,'' he said. ``So, I became a fan of the music. And
the night life isn't bad either. You find yourself in a bar at,
like, 10 a.m. and you've been there seven hours. But my liver told
me to move back to Seattle for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   While in New Orleans, Dulli first recorded a solo record, ``The
Twilight Singers,'' due to be released in the spring. It is, he
says, on the bleak and ambient side, coming from deep inside. Dulli
calls it a ``pre-therapy'' record. ``It was, in a weird way, a
final farewell to that kind of feeling,'' says Dulli.
</P>
<P>
   ``1965'' is a post-therapy record, the happy result of
counseling and the use of anti-depressant Zoloft, which Dulli
considers a miracle drug. ``My depression was starting to
physically affect my body,'' he says of severe stomach pain he used
to have. The antidepressant, he says, helped him get ``that lust
for life back. I was sampling earthly delights while I was making
the record.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to pulling out of that swoon, he thought of following the
suicide path of his friend, Nirvana's Kurt Cobain. ``I was really
suicidal. I contemplated the act. I still feel everything. I just
don't let it kill me.'' Laughing the laugh of a survivor, Dulli
says he was scoping out a painless exit, ``Yeah, give me some
information on the Hale-Bopp comet, get some Heaven's Gate
applesauce, lace up the Nikes, it's time to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The depression, Dulli says, gathered force as expectations for
Afghan Whigs seemed unmet. The band had high hopes for ``Black
Love,'' but they didn't materialize. The group felt the record
company, Elektra, failed to promote it. They wanted to be let out
of their contract, so Dulli says the band went on hiatus while
negotiations were hammered out. They didn't break up, but ``we had
to play possum for a while _ feet up, little Xs on our eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Dulli looks back at his inflated ego of five years ago. The band
was on the rise with its ``Gentlemen'' CD; he considered himself
hot stuff. ``How can it not affect you?'' he says. ``I'm a nobody
and then I'm a somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   His place in the world now? ``Pretty miniscule,'' Dulli says,
without missing a beat. ``I really have a perspective on things
now. I can look back at that period and I'm the same guy ... I look
back and say, `You had some fire in you, kid.' And I still do. But
it's just that I've learned ways to channel it. And, frankly,
singing about sadness and pain is not the way I want to live my
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although, believe me, when I come to Boston I'll be screaming,
but not the whole two hours. I mean, I got a changeup and a slider
to go with my fastball now. You'll get the whole thing, man.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM, Mass. _ The four members of a string quartet play four
instruments, two violins, a viola, and a cello, with the goal of
achieving a musical unity. Still, however long they have been
playing together, however integrated their interpretations, rarely
are they playing instruments that were conceived of, and created,
as a integral group _ as ``a quartet.'' But over the past six
months, that is just what violin-maker (and viola-maker and
cello-maker) Marilyn Wallin has been doing _ making a quartet of
instruments: two violins, a viola, and a cello.
</P>
<P>
   The impetus was an international competition for quartets of
instruments being held this week in Salt Lake City in which
luthiers _ makers of string instruments _ from around the world
enter four matched instruments.
</P>
<P>
   But sadly, win or lose, Wallin's instruments will probably be
played together, as a quartet, only once or twice during the
competition, then be sold separately.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unlikely they'll ever be played together again,'' Wallin
said _ the viola has actually already been sold and one of the
violins was made on a commission.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Her 100th instrument
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While Wallin, 43, has been making stringed instruments since
1979 _ the quartet-competition cello is her 100th instrument _ this
is the first quartet of instruments that she has made. On two
earlier attempts, she ran out of time before completing the set of
four. On those occasions, she was still the violin-making
instructor at the North Bennet Street School, one of three such
schools in the United States. It was to devote full time to
instrument-making that she left the school last spring after 11
years and set up the Boston Violinmakers Cooperative with Chris
Thibodeau, 29, one of her former students.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Wallin, who has been intent on making stringed
instruments ever since she met a violin-maker as a teenager,
Thibodeau came to it after working for an architectural
metalworker. Violin-making, he said, ``is a lot quieter and a lot
less violent.''
</P>
<P>
   While most of the several dozen makers of stringed instruments
in the Boston area _ the rich legacy, said Wallin, ``of the days
when there were violin-makers up-and-down Newbury Street'' _ work
alone, the cooperative is looking for additional members and has a
spare workroom for them.
</P>
<P>
   Located on the second floor of an older commercial building on
Waltham's Main Street, their workshop combines the most traditional
aspects of stringed instrument making _ the time- and
labor-intensive work of making their own varnish and then brushing
it on _ with such modern equipment as band saws and routers to do
the rough shaping before hand tools are used to create the soft
curves of the instruments.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Begins with the wood
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But it all begins with the wood, and one room in the workshop is
stacked with slabs of wood _ maple for the backs of the instruments
and spruce for the front. There are dealers in wood for stringed
instruments, and prices for matched pieces range from the hundreds
of dollars to the thousands, depending on the beauty of the grain.
</P>
<P>
   But, said Thibodeau, ``some of this wood could be in your
firewood pile. When I was in school a guy brought in a piece that
he had found in a woodpile. It made a pretty good instrument.''
</P>
<P>
   Next to the wood room _ a location that suggests the orderly
progression of the process _ is the mechanical room. A basic model
of an instrument's front (or back) is laid out on the table of a
router with the rough slab of wood that will be the new instrument
next to it. As the router's tracing arm moves over the model, it's
cutting arm shapes the slab into roughly the right thickness _ in a
matter of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But from there, the rest of the shaping is all by hand _ not
very different from how it would have been done in an Italian
master's workshop 200 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the hand tools Wallin and Thibodeau use came from her
father who was a cabinetmaker. And the bench room where they do the
handwork is dominated by a round, revolving worktable built on the
pedestal of an old dentist's chair from the office of Thibodeau's
father, a Scituate dentist.
</P>
<P>
   The last step is the varnishing. Wallin and Thibodeau make their
own, mixing blue, red, and green pigments to achieve the shade of
brown that will bring out the beauty of the wood, then applying it
in as many as nine coats.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can spend as much time varnishing as you did in making the
instrument,'' Thibodeau said. ``If it comes out wrong, you want to
burn it because it's a long, depressing task of removing it and
then starting all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Power tools replace apprentices
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To the purist taken aback at the notion of using electrically
powered cutting and shaping tools in the making of such a work of
art as a violin _ not to mention making two of them, plus a viola
and a cello, in the space of six months _ Wallin has a sharp
retort.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Stradivari, the 17th-century Italian violin-maker whose
surviving instruments fetch prices in the millions, made at least
1,200 instruments, maybe twice that, during his career. ``That
figures to be maybe 20 a year,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a band saw and a router,'' Wallin said. ``He had three
sons and a shop full of apprentices.''
</P>
<P>
   And as an artistic matter, Wallin said, ``there's a creative
flow in making a violin. It's hard enough to hang on to a concept
over the period of a month. It's not just the execution of the
concept, but the problem of keeping the concept in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   What Wallin and Thibodeau _ with the help of one apprentice, a
current student at North Bennet Street _ are making are instruments
that are well beyond the $500 range of the completely factory-made
``student'' violins. Wallin's violins fetch $10,000 and her cellos
$20,000. As a beginner with no reputation, Thibodeau's instruments
will sell for about half that.
</P>
<P>
   Their instruments will not be slavish copies of 200-year-old
Italian and French instruments _ copies, Thibodeau sneers, ``which
are literally forgeries where they'll sit down and scar or scratch
the copy instrument in the same way that the old instrument was
damaged over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Finding a middle ground
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``What we try to do,'' Thibodeau said, ``is find a middle ground
between what we want to make, what they made back then, and what
people want to buy now.''
</P>
<P>
   There's some dispute between Wallin and Thibodeau on just where
that middle ground lies.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you buy a new car,' Thibodeau asks, ``do you tell the
dealer you want some rust on it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a bit like a mercenary for giving an instrument an
antique look,'' Wallin said, ``but I enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the cello she was working on during the last weeks before
heading to the Salt Lake City competition, Wallin said that while
the instrument itself is thoroughly modern ``with a healthier,
stronger sound,'' the varnish will be ``antiqued'' and it
eventually ``can sit down with the other members of her string
quartet, and they won't know whether she's playing a $100,000
18th-century French instrument or a $20,000 modern one.''
</P>
<P>
   But, said Thibodeau, the modern instrument will have been
designed and made to be able to support the stronger metal strings
that replaced the older gut strings. ``The modern player,'' he
said, ``should have a modern instrument.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallin lives in Wayland with her husband, violinist and violin
teacher John Emery _ who ``of course'' plays one of her violins _
and their two daughters. Wallin herself plays the viola _ her own,
``of course'' _ in the Worcester-based Thayer Symphony Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   As for Thibodeau, he has a girlfriend, Shoko Kanamouri, who is
waiting for him to finish the cello he has been crafting so that
she can play it.

SULTRY KATARINA WITT GLIDES FROM SPORTS TO ENTERTAINMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's not as if people haven't seen Katarina Witt
naked before. Back when she was growing up in East Germany's
workers' paradise, she frolicked unencumbered on nude beaches.
``Until I was 16,'' she says. ``Until people began to recognize
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Who doesn't recognize her now, after two Olympic gold medals,
after all the skating shows, the made-for-TV specials, the
endorsements, the movie cameos in ``Jerry Maguire'' and ``Ronin''?
Heads turn whenever Witt walks through a hotel lobby, into a
restaurant, down Fifth Avenue. Especially this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny,'' Witt is saying, relaxing in a demure sweater and
slacks in her suite at the St. Regis Hotel. ``You walk down the
street, and you think everybody must have seen it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It,'' of course, is the December issue of Playboy magazine,
which has a sultry and decollete Witt on the cover and 10 pages of
her inside, stripped right down to her mistletoe. There is Kati
dipping her toes beneath a Hawaiian waterfall, stretched languidly
on a slab of rock, bending for a sip of water, darting between
giant trees like a wood nymph, doing a handstand wrist-deep in a
tropical lawn. Kati, au naturel but completely natural.
</P>
<P>
   As they say in the nudist Web pages: This is not a porn site.
``When people heard I did Playboy, I think their imagination was
more sinful than what they will see,'' says Witt, who reportedly
received between $500,000 and $1,000,000 for unwrapping herself for
Christmas. ``Because once you see the pictures, you see they are
just beautiful and natural and pure. If they had been sexy photos,
I would not have done it. I would not have been comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   So why did she, other than for the paycheck, which merely added
a few more zeroes to a bank account that already has plenty.
``Because it was time,'' Witt shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   Because she is 33 now and all but finished with competitive
skating. Because there are no frowning federations to forbid her,
no scandalized judges to mark her down. Because age and gravity
have not yet begun to taffy-pull her. Because Playboy has a
reputation for doing tasteful things with celebrities, she says,
and Witt has evolved into a celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   She is the only woman since the legendary Sonja Henie to win
more than one Olympic skating title. She has skated in hundreds of
exhibitions, appeared in movies and on cable, done endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   Posing for Playboy, as supermodel Cindy Crawford and other
celebs have done, is simply what some do at this stage of their
careers. ``It would have been wrong 10 years ago when I was just
finished with amateur skating,'' Witt says. ``Now I've done so many
things that I'm known not so much as a skater (but) as an
entertainer. I'm so much in the public eye and crossing over into
so many different directions that people may think, yeah, it makes
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Witt is more than a crossover now, she is a throwback to a time
when the ladies' champion was a grownup. Witt is (and always was) a
womanly figure in a sport now dominated by 4-foot, 90-pound
pubescents who routinely whirl through seven triple jumps in a
program.
</P>
<P>
   When she came out of retirement at 28 to compete in the 1994
Olympics as a tribute to shattered Sarajevo (where she won her
first gold medal), Witt seemed to be skating in a time warp.
</P>
<P>
   The country she came out of _ a socialist netherworld of border
guards and Monopoly money, smoke-spewing fiberglass cars and grumpy
Marxist septuagenarians in ill-fitting suits _ no longer existed,
having merged into a reunited Germany.
</P>
<P>
   For most of a decade, Witt had been the East German poster girl,
the sexy and saucy face that her drab and repressed homeland showed
the world, the glamorous exception on an Olympic team whose
swollen-shouldered, deep-voiced women had been pumped full of male
hormones and steroids and kept out of the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our athletes were always thought of as parts of this big
sports machine,'' Witt says. ``We were never really allowed to talk
to journalists and tell them stories. We always seemed like we were
very hidden, like nobody could touch us.''
</P>
<P>
   Not Kati, though. She winked and giggled at press conferences.
She schmoozed with judges. She practiced in T-shirts and leotards.
``Even when we had rules and strict orders,'' Witt says. ``I would
always find a way of getting around them.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Kati wanted _ skates, costumes, ballet lessons _ Kati
got. She also got watched like a hawk by the Stasi, the dreaded
secret police.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then all of a sudden The Wall came down and I was able to
go,'' Witt remembers. ``I didn't have to ask some official, please,
may I go and skate?''
</P>
<P>
   Witt was free to travel, to cut her own deals, to sign her own
contracts and keep the cash. She competed in professional events.
She hooked up with Brian Boitano on a special ice tour. She
restaged ``Carmen on Ice'' for HBO and won an Emmy. She did ads for
Diet Coke (``The Two Greatest Things on Ice'') and Danskin. She did
Olympic commentary for CBS at Albertville, France.
</P>
<P>
   She became Katarina (celebrities need no last names), a
mid-Atlantic woman for the post-socialist age, jetting between
Germany and America. (``I love going back and forth.'') She bought
apartments in Manhattan (which she's since given up) and on the
east side of Berlin (``It's becoming a great town again. It's quite
incredible.''), overlooking the Reichstag, the Brandenburg Gate,
and Potsdamerplatz.
</P>
<P>
   While she has continued skating (She'll do the Elvis Stojko and
Champions on Ice tours this season.), Witt has become a serial
dabbler in movies and TV. ``Bits and pieces here and there,'' she
says. Witt appeared in ``Arli$$,'' the HBO show about a hypermanic
sports agent, and played a Russian figure skater in ``Ronin.''
She's created a her own line of jewelry, which will be sold on the
Home Shopping Network in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not as shy as I was a few years ago,'' Witt says. ``I am
much more open for other things. If I think I can handle it, I'll
do it, just for the fun of it, for having a new experience. I take
more risks now.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as she could do it her way, Witt was game to go bare. As
long as she could choose the site, the photographer, even the shots
that would appear in the magazine. ``I was able to have control
about it, how they would end up,'' Witt says.
</P>
<P>
   Not like the time she spun out of her dress at a Paris
exhibition and photographers snapped a peek-a-boo shot of her bare
breasts. ``That was much more embarrassing because it happened on
the ice,'' Witt says. ``My costume slid down and it looked
horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, there was no costume. Every morning of their
three-day island shoot last June, Witt jokingly would ask the
stylist what she should wear. ``Nothing,'' she was told.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I saw the photos for the first time, I was very proud of
them,'' Witt says. ``I couldn't wait to get them out. I wanted
people to see them. The way they're done, they're just so tasteful,
so beautiful and so pure that nobody could say anything not
pleasant about it. Looking at them now, I'm wondering why I didn't
do it earlier. But everything to the right time.''

POWERFUL DOCUMENTARY FILMS TURN BACK THE CLOCK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB MCCARTHY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Shake, rattle and roll.
</P>
<P>
   So it went at the International Documentary Congress 3 last week
as two catchy programs, ``Docs Rock'' and ``Docs That Shook the
World,'' rolled for appreciative audiences that included
documentarians, industry types, docuphiles and just plain music
lovers.
</P>
<P>
   The opening-night screening of ``Docs Rock'' created a buzz in
the Samuel Goldwyn Theater as the camera locked onto some of the
world's greatest rock bands. Hosted by Elvis Mitchell of National
Public Radio, the program was broken into four categories:
Documenting the Famous, Performance Documentary as Art, Framing
Festivals and Covering the Music Scene.
</P>
<P>
   The groove times rolled again with ``Let It Be'' (1970),
``Woodstock'' (1970) and ``Gimme Shelter,'' the Rolling Stones'
free concert at Altamont Speedway at which Hells Angels attacked
and killed a spectator in full view of the stage. It progressed
into punk (``The Great Rock 'N' Roll Swindle'' and ``The Decline of
Western Civilization''), the Irish super band U2 (``Rattle and
Hum,'') and grunge (``Hype!), Doug Pray's look at the explosion of
the Seattle music scene with performances and interviews with Pearl
Jam, Nirvana and Soundgarden.
</P>
<P>
   Between rock and grunge came an entertaining segue from 1980,
``Divine Madness!'' _ an all-round performance of song and chat by
the divine Bette Midler.
</P>
<P>
   The shaking continued into the next night when Betsy McLane, the
executive director of the International Documentary Association,
opened ``Docs That Shook the World'' with a simple explanation:
These were films that mobilized people by changing their
perceptions.
</P>
<P>
   The moving images that passed across the screen included home
movies of Romanovs as they played games, danced, inspected troops
and greeted dignitaries to the Russian palace. In making the ``Fall
of the Romanov Dynasty'' in 1927, a female editor named Dziga
Vertov found a box marked ``Counter-revolutionary material'' after
the Bolshevik Revolution that contained the ruling family's
footage. Then she edited in scenes of everyday, working life in
Russia _ coal miners, children, laborers _ that stood in
juxtaposition to the images of the ruling czar and his relatives in
their privileged surroundings. In a forerunner to later
documentaries, Vertov took archival film that was shot for one
purpose and gave it a completely different meaning.
</P>
<P>
   That was certainly the case in ``Night and Fog,'' the 1955
French documentary by Alain Resnais that retraces the steps of the
Jews who endured the concentration camps erected by the Nazis. Like
Vertov, he obtained footage the Nazis had shot to document their
achievements to later generations of Germans. However, with the
fall of the Third Reich, the film was captured by Allied troops and
used for a more sobering purpose: to re-enact the plight of
European Jews who were singled out by their Aryan conquerors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Docs That Shook the World'' passed from World War II into the
volatile civil-rights era in the South. The first and second
marches on Selma, Ala., were interwoven into scenes of Martin
Luther King Jr., the Rev. Ralph Abernathy and thousands of people
of all colors playing key roles in the brutal and shocking
confrontation with police that is still hard to watch.
</P>
<P>
   And as a reminder that each decade has its rallying cry,
documentaries about Vietnam (``The War at Home'' and ``Hearts and
Minds''), the nuclear age (``Hiroshima-Nagasaki, August 1945'' and
``If You Love This Planet'') and the AIDS epidemic (``Common
Threads: Stories From the Quilt'') brought back images of student
sit-ins, young Americans fighting in Vietnam and ground zero after
a nuclear blast.
</P>
<P>
   Producer Judy Richardson, who is responsible for ``Eyes on the
Prize'' and is a lecturer in schools about the civil-rights
movement, eloquently put the role of documentaries into perspective
when she said:
</P>
<P>
   ``They validate our experiences, and often the experiences of
those who whose voices are not heard.''

CONCERT CROWDS CLAMOR FOR GREATEST HITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Peter Buck of R.E.M. was saying the other day he
wasn't sure he ever wanted to go back on tour while audiences were
in the mood to hear nothing but hits.
</P>
<P>
   The thought hit home, he said, in October when R.E.M. was
playing Neil Young's annual Bridge School Benefit concert just
outside San Francisco and decided to stick mostly new tunes in the
set, songs the band was excited about playing.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd had other ideas. Silent and still at the Shoreline
Amphitheater, the audience made known its displeasure at having to
sit through material it wasn't familiar with. The new songs were
taken from R.E.M.'s ``Up,'' due to be released the following week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went on after the Wallflowers, Sarah McLachlan and
Barenaked Ladies and these other acts that just played their
hits,'' Buck said. ``I remember a time when audiences wanted to
hear something new.''
</P>
<P>
   We do, too. When one went to see a group like Little Feat,
Steely Dan, the Who and especially the Grateful Dead, you knew you
were going to hear music you'd never heard before. That was part of
the fun.
</P>
<P>
   These days, concerts have become greatest-hits shows, oldies
shows before their time. Gigs where the crowd gets what it wants,
no questions asked.
</P>
<P>
   That's a shame because live music can mean much more than just
duplicating the album tracks.
</P>
<P>
   BLUES HAS ITS REWARDS
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic Records co-founder Ahmet Ertegun and blues crooner
Bobby (Blue) Bland will accept the Blues Foundation's Lifetime
achievement awards Monday at a ceremony at the House of Blues.
</P>
<P>
   Ertegun, poised to enter his ninth decade, has spent a good 60
of those years at the forefront of the record business, focusing on
jazz, blues and rock.
</P>
<P>
   Southern soul singer Bobby Rush will receive the B.B. King Blues
Hero Award from the foundation. Performers at the fourth annual
event include Ray Charles, Stephen Stills, Boz Scaggs, Ruth Brown
and Bland.

A BIG DAY FOR TWO POLITICAL SONS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHRIS MATTHEWS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush once joked about having a
father whose idea of the perfect son was Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But with the midterm elections over and the 2000 presidential
election looming large on the political horizon, the rivalry
between the sons of these two old political families is turning
serious.
</P>
<P>
   When pollsters asked those leaving the voting booths on Tuesday
to state their presidential preferences, 44 percent in one exit
poll favored the vice president to succeed Bill Clinton, while 56
percent favored Bush. Voters added even more pizzazz to a possible
``Bush in 2000'' boom by electing the Texas incumbent to a second
term and his brother Jeb to the governorship of that other
vote-rich Southern state: Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those auspicious signs of a national Bush upswing, Gore
ended the mid-term elections a big bicoastal winner. His final day
of campaigning, split between New York and the West Coast, climaxed
with two blockbuster gains for his party: Democratic Rep. Charles
Schumer's defeat of Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato in New York and
the victory in California of Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, who will become
the next governor.
</P>
<P>
   In winning on both coasts, Democrats showed fresh clout in two
states critical to the Clinton-Gore victories in 1992 and 1996.
California's 54 electoral votes and New York's 33 together are
one-third of those needed to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats also displayed unexpected strength in a region of
the country that has been inhospitable to them in recent elections:
the South. In addition to poaching a GOP Senate seat in North
Carolina held by Jesse Helms' ally Lauch Faircloth, they saved one
in South Carolina held by veteran Democratic Sen. Ernest Hollings.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also can hope for help in 2000 from a number of newly
elected Democratic governors in the South: Don Siegelman, who
defeated Alabama Republican Fob James; Jim Hodges, who beat
troubled incumbent David Beasley in South Carolina; and Roy Barnes,
who overcame a huge deficit to save the Georgia governorship.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to these unexpected victories, Gore has reason to believe
that he can make inroads in a region that the Republicans have come
to view as the ``solid South.'' It was the region where Clinton and
Gore, both Southerners themselves, fared badly in their two
national campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Less clear for Gore is the 2000 outlook in the Midwest, where
Democrats recorded some embarrassing midterm losses. In both 1992
and 1996, the Clinton-Gore ticket won national office with the
strong support the industrial Midwest as well as the West Coast and
the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, the Democratic candidate for governor was Geoffrey
Fieger, who won notoriety as the lawyer for doctor-assisted suicide
pioneer Jack Kevorkian. Fieger was demolished Tuesday, creating
havoc in a state whose presidential voting tends more than any
others to match the country's as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   In Illinois, Democratic Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun went down to
defeat, despite strong support from Chicago's large black
electorate. She had been a pillar of the state's Democratic
coalition led by Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley.
</P>
<P>
   After Tuesday's victories, Democrats in Ohio have been removed
from all high-level offices. Republican Bob Taft reclaimed a family
tradition by winning the governorship, while former GOP Gov. George
Voinovich was elected to the Senate to replace retiring Democrat
John Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota, Democrat Hubert Humphrey III was humiliated in his
third-place finish in the governor's race behind Jesse ``The Body''
Ventura, a professional wrestler running on the Minnesota Reform
Party ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' happiest Midwestern surprise Tuesday was the
uphill re-election of outspent Sen. Russell Feingold in Wisconsin.
That was the one heartland fight Gore made time to join in his
final day of coast-to-coast campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, it was an impressive night for a party and its
front-running presidential candidate, Al Gore, who have spent much
of the year buffeted by the Monica Lewinsky scandal and its
after-shocks. The reluctance of voters to hold Democrats
responsible for Clinton's problems is good news for the vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the Davis victory in the California and Schumer's in
New York, Gore can begin erecting the same bicoastal strategy for
2000 that brought Clinton and him to victory.
</P>
<P>
   Gore can look forward to a millennial match with that other heir
to an American political tradition: George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   When asked by those same exit pollsters whether they would want
one of their children to become president someday, 69 percent of
Tuesday's voters said ``No.'' It's safe to say that the Gore and
Bush families were not among them.

CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES CAUTIOUS ABOUT NEW GOVERNOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD IWATA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A big question in state business circles is
whether Gov.-elect Gray Davis and his Democratic administration
will help or hurt the state's economy after 16 years of Republican
governors.
</P>
<P>
   Helped by a strong national economy and the bull market on Wall
Street, retiring Gov. Pete Wilson has been a cheerleader for
business, seeking lower taxes and higher investment credits,
creating a task force to keep companies in California and leading
the fight to overhaul costly workers' compensation insurance.
</P>
<P>
   About 1.6 million jobs have been created in California since
1993 _ the worst year of the recession, according to the state
Department of Finance.
</P>
<P>
   And a healthy business climate has helped fatten tax revenues,
letting the state funnel $22.2 billion last year into public
education. That was up from $16.2 billion five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Can Davis keep those numbers growing under his leadership? While
Davis is a seasoned politician and savvy deal-maker with three
decades of public service, few know where he stands on
business-related issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``He claims to be a centrist, so I hope he doesn't do anything
that's destructive to the California economy,'' said Bill
Wilkinson, a Republican and the owner of Greenleaf Produce in San
Francisco's produce market.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson's company employs 100 workers, with revenue of $17
million per year. He faces strong competition from large regional
and national corporations, and he spends more than 95 cents of each
dollar on labor costs, rent, taxes, trucks and gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely hope that the economic climate stays healthy
under Davis,'' Wilkinson said. ``My business _ and 100 employees _
depend on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor-elect's supporters believe Davis will boost the
state's already-strong economy while also fattening paychecks and
strengthening their employment rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gray wants to build a new and better economy for California
for workers and for business, and we strongly agree with him,''
said Art Pulaski, secretary-treasurer of the California Labor
Federation, which represents 2,000 unions and 2 million union
members.
</P>
<P>
   Davis may inherit an economy slower than what Wilson has enjoyed
over the past five or six years. And that could mean trimming
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, executives praise Davis and his work on issues such as
transportation and education.
</P>
<P>
   As chief aide to former Gov. Jerry Brown 20 years ago, Davis
spearheaded a dialogue among business and government leaders on the
worsening transportation problem south of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Those meetings, with David Packard, of Hewlett-Packard fame, and
other high-tech luminaries, led to county measures in the early
1980s that provided sales tax financing for three regional highway
projects totaling $1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pulled together and found common ground on an issue that
was very important to all of us,'' said Carl Guardino, president of
the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group, which represents 130
high-tech employers in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis is a question mark on such hard-core business issues
as corporate tax credits and securities litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Technology executives still are worried about Davis' neutral
stance on Proposition 211, the defeated 1996 ballot measure that
would have strengthened a shareholder's right to file suit against
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Securities litigation and other frivolous lawsuits are still
very important issues to high-tech,'' Guardino said. ``Neutrality
is no longer an option, and we hope he will come down on the side
of a healthy state economy, rather than a handful of trial
attorneys'' who supported the ballot initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Some business leaders fear Davis may push for legislation and
policies that would increase business costs, such as unemployment
taxes and workers' compensation benefits. The California Chamber of
Commerce calls these ``job-killer'' bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we'll see a lot of those bills reintroduced,'' said
Allan Zaremberg, president of the California Chamber of Commerce in
Sacramento. ``If you put them all together, there would be a
devastating impact on the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   While executives have reservations about the polices the Davis
administration might pursue, labor leaders were celebrating his
election Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old Wilson regime was governed by exclusion, while Gray
Davis will govern by inclusion,'' Pulaski said. ``We don't expect
Gray to implement every issue we want, but we'll have an
opportunity to join the debate.''

DEMOCRATS, GOP FACE NEW CHALLENGES IN POST-D'AMATO ERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CAHER and JAMES M. ODATO  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After three terms, Alfonse D'Amato _ like Mario Cuomo
and Ed Koch before him _ simply wore out his welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo's attempt at a fourth four-year term as governor fell flat
in 1994 when he ran into George Pataki. Koch couldn't capture a
fourth term as mayor of New York City. And now D'Amato, in failing
to retain the U.S. Senate seat he has held since 1980, joins the
ranks of political has-beens.
</P>
<P>
   Or does he? Despite D'Amato's stunning loss to Rep. Charles
Schumer, many political observers predicted the Long Islander would
remain a behind-the-scenes power broker while two of his proteges _
Pataki and state Republican chief William Powers _ take a more
public role in running their party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think D'Amato gets credit, and deserves credit, for
rebuilding the Republican Party in New York,'' said pollster
Maurice Carroll of the independent Quinnipiac College Polling
Institute in Connecticut. ``He picked out this obscure, pro-choice
legislator from the Hudson Valley, and the guy is now the governor.
He put in Bill Powers, who I think is a tactical genius.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Carroll added, ``I don't think his absence will unmake the
Republican Party in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The GOP's loss of its most forceful advocate and best
fund-raiser puts Pataki in the political driver's seat while at
once taking away the keys, said Henry Sheinkopf, a political
strategist used by the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Pataki lost a tour guide to the Washington (political
action committee) circle and insider obstacle course that anyone
who runs for national office has to go through,'' Sheinkopf said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Sheinkopf said, Schumer's victory is a dagger in the
campaign strategy of Arthur Finkelstein, the Republican strategist
whose usual battle plan _ bashing Democrats as liberal downstate
extremists _ failed this year. Schumer was relentlessly portrayed
as a liberal throwback, yet he ran far stronger than expected
outside the New York metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The downstate bogeyman doesn't exist anymore,'' Sheinkopf
said. ``Schumer's a moderate; they don't have anyone to attack
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's loss may strengthen the credibility and fund-raising
ability of the Democratic Party and its state chairwoman, Judith
Hope.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, D'Amato's absence could enhance Pataki's
standing. Unlike D'Amato, Pataki is viewed as a moderate Republican
whose message is at least acceptable, in many instances, to
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ironic part is, I think the loss of Senator D'Amato frees
(Pataki) from his mentor and allows him to be seen as a person
entirely on his own,'' said John Zogby, a pollster from Utica.
``They can't say he is controlled by Alfonse D'Amato (anymore).''
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the election on the Republicans may be more an ego
blow than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Although the GOP lost an incumbent U.S. senator, failed
miserably in a major goal of picking up seats in the Assembly and
couldn't expand its hold on the state Senate, the party retained
the golden ring of state electoral politics: the governorship.
</P>
<P>
   And that, analysts say, is where the patronage and prestige
reign.
</P>
<P>
   For the Democrats, the question becomes whether Schumer can be
the force for turning around his partially out-of-power party as
D'Amato was for the Republicans. Schumer is a stellar fund-raiser
and, it is worth noting, a politician who has never lost a race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck Schumer becomes the D'Amato for the Democratic Party,''
Sheinkopf said. ``He's tenacious and dogged. It could have a real
impact on the 2000 Democratic election.''
</P>
<P>
   But Carroll noted that Schumer is a fundamentally different
politician than the scrappy, grassroots D'Amato who, for 30 years
in politics, seemed to embody the ``all politics is local'' adage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Schumer a Democratic D'Amato?'' he asked. ``I don't think
he is. There are similarities. They are both hard-working
legislators. They both live lives permeated by politics. My guess
is that in his own way, Schumer will be a `Sen. Pothole,' too, but
will he devote energy to party rebuilding the way D'Amato did? I
don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said Wednesday that rebuilding the Democratic Party is a
key goal. However, he also said he no plans to take over the
leadership of the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to run it,'' he said. ``But I do want to
strengthen it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have to have unity,'' Schumer said. ``There are times
when the folks in New York City should lend their support to an
upstate candidate... and vice versa.''

CICELY TYSON ENJOYS RESPONSIBILITY OF GUIDING `MAMA FLORA' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MIKE McDANIEL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The beauty of Mama Flora's family is evident in its end result:
It survives and thrives.
</P>
<P>
   It survives slavery, poverty, world war.
</P>
<P>
   It survives even the author Alex Haley, whose Pulitzer
Prize-winning ``Roots'' reflected his father's side of the family,
and whose ``Mama Flora's Family'' tells the story of his mother's
side.
</P>
<P>
   Haley, 70, died in 1992 after suffering a heart seizure, never
seeing this story fully realized in print or in film. But it
survives, thanks to the work of David Stevens, who finished the
soon-to-be-released novel that forms the foundation for the CBS
miniseries (Sunday and Tuesday night).
</P>
<P>
   And it positively thrives in the hands of such gifted actors as
Cicely Tyson, Blair Underwood, Queen Latifah and Mario Van Peebles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was aware that when Alex and my manager last spoke, which
was the Friday before he passed, he told him that he had something
for me,'' Tyson recalled. The following Monday, Feb. 10, 1992, she
learned Haley had died, apparently along with that ``something'' he
had for her. ``I never knew what it was he was referring to,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Then last year, her manager sent her two scripts and asked her
to read them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called him and said, `When do we start?' He said to me, `Do
you realize this is what Alex was talking about?'
</P>
<P>
   ``And then I was breathless.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson and Haley had bonded in 1976, when filming ``Roots.'' That
production not only legitimized and popularized the miniseries
form, but also provided the most expansive and absorbing story
about African-Americans in television history. And in it, Tyson had
played a small but significant role, as the mother of the African
Kunte Kinte.
</P>
<P>
   ``During that filming he was ever present on the set, telling
his wonderful, marvelous stories as only he could tell them,''
Tyson said. ``It was always very enlightening and rewarding to have
him around, sort of a confirmation that you were making a
contribution to something that was going to take the world by
storm. And in fact, it did.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, here she was being asked to play an ancestor from
Haley's mother's side of the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an overwhelming responsibility,'' she said. ``And when
one feels overwhelmed by anything, your tendency is to strive to do
the best that you can, and that's truly all you can do. That was
the case of everyone of us. When we sat down to talk about him and
what he might have felt and/or said in a given place or
circumstance, everyone knew that we were doing it to his memory.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is essential to know this to get the maximum out of
``Mama Flora's Family.'' To see the struggle continue. To
experience a ``Roots''-like experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to do justice to Alex Haley,'' said Underwood, who
plays Flora's son, Willie. ``It is his legacy, his final book, so
you want to do justice, put your best foot forward, tell the story
he wanted to tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have great respect for his talent as an author but also his
ability to tap into something so universal _ family and the history
of family and bringing those characters to life. The characters in
this film have a very universal appeal. People will see themselves
in it.''
</P>
<P>
   The story, like life, is complex, and on television veers,
sometimes uncomfortably, toward melodrama. Flora is the strong
thread running through it, a woman who, like many of her time, must
summon all courage to cope with poverty, tragedy and inequity in
dealing with life and raising a family.
</P>
<P>
   It's also the story of Willie and his uneasy relationship with
Flora's illegitimate son Luke (Van Peebles). And it's also the
story of Willie's daughter Diana (Latifah), who runs away with her
baby when she can't deal with the bad hand dealt her.
</P>
<P>
   Four generations. A mini-``Roots.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that `Roots' was about his father's side, but `Mama
Flora' represents his mother,'' said Tyson. ``God, when I think
about him having me in mind when he was writing it, I tell you,
it's difficult for me to breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   The story stretches back to 1912, and calls for the principal
actors to show gradations of age.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, you have to look at your own deck of cards, what God
has blessed you with physically,'' said Underwood, who calls this
role the most challenging of his career. ``You have to approach the
fact that people know your visage and that you have to alter it.''
</P>
<P>
   Underwood's dazzling to behold. He nails those subtle age and
character differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I purposely start off very lean and slim at age 17. But by the
time I'm 50, I have a subtle pot belly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I approached Willie in three different chapters. At 17 he's
one kind of man, young and trying to find his leggings in the
world. At ages 21 to 25, he's going off to war, drinking and
gambling and trying to find women. By age 45 and 50, he's really
trying to find his heart. He's at peace with who he is and come to
terms with a great many things of his life, not the least of which
is the choices he has made.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's choices are no less subtle, but she has a bit of
experience in this aging process. In her Emmy-winning performance
as the title character in 1974's ``The Autobiography of Miss Jane
Pittman,'' she ages from teen-ager to 110-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   And viewers will find that Flora and Jane share other qualities.
Both have a positive spirit ``and there's nothing in this world,
even at their age, that they cannot do,'' Tyson said.
</P>
<P>
   When Jane learned that her grandson had been killed for drinking
from a whites-only water fountain, she felt compelled, at age 100,
to check out the murder scene personally.
</P>
<P>
   In a stirring, unforgettable moment, Jane slowly shuffles to the
whites-only fountain and takes a deep drink.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Flora makes a commitment to her dying husband that she
will try to see that their infant Willie will not have to suffer
the pangs that she and her husband suffered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wasn't easy,'' Tyson said. ``It was up and down and up and
down. But she never wavered and at times when she thought she
might, she went to her knees and talked to the man upstairs.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, she succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to believe that Flora is Jane's friend,'' Tyson
said, then laughed a deep, long, rich laugh. ``Because I tell you
one thing, they certainly would get along well, believe me.'' &QL;

WOUNDED VETERANS FIND RECOVERY THROUGH MUSIC AND DANCE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAI HUYNH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Thaddeus Holloway still can't sleep most nights. His
memories won't let him.
</P>
<P>
   His mind drifts to 1966. He was a U.S. Marine in Vietnam, he'd
just turned 18, and he'd just killed a man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost some very good friends over there and experienced some
things that didn't smell good, look good,'' he said, slumping as he
recalled the horror.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling obligated to serve his country, Holloway had enlisted in
the Marines and abandoned plans of college.
</P>
<P>
   ``That saying of President Kennedy's stuck in my mind, `Ask not
what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your
country,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the 50-year-old still tries to make sense of his actions.
</P>
<P>
   Raised in the church, there was another saying he wanted to live
by: Thou shalt not kill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing that you can't unring the bell haunts me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest of 11 children, Holloway grew up singing in the
Baptist church choir his mother directed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But after the war, I stopped singing. I just stopped, and I
didn't know why,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three decades would pass before he would find his voice
again.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway, like many other Vietnam veterans, suffers from
post-traumatic stress. He finally checked into the Veterans Affairs
Chicago Healthcare-West Division in 1990. He wanted nothing to do
with the world; he still thought the Viet Cong were waiting to
ambush him behind the trees.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a series of treatments, nothing seemed to help. Then
creative art therapist Jessie Herndon entered the picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``She came on the ward, passed out some music sheets, and I
started singing to cheer myself up, and it worked,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway started looking forward to the music therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The music was inspiring. Slowly, it helped me to rid some of
the baggage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Chicago resident makes up one-third of the gospel
group of Slatton, Brown and Holloway.
</P>
<P>
   The trio is among the participants gathered in Houston this week
for the National Veterans Creative Arts Festival. On Sunday, the
weeklong annual event will culminate in a free art exhibit and
variety show featuring the artwork and performances of 103
veterans, the best of 2,000 entries from patients of VA hospitals
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Established in 1989, the festival promotes recovery through
creative arts therapy by recognizing the accomplishments of the
veterans, said national coordinator Elizabeth Mackey.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the veterans were fine-tuning their presentations in
the rehearsal room of the Crowne Plaza Medical Center in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in black, former Army Lt. D.J. Smalley gingerly lifted
his petite ballroom dance partner. It's difficult to imagine that
he is the same man who entered San Diego's VA hospital six years
ago after his car rolled down a 75-foot cliff.
</P>
<P>
   Thrown 200 feet from his vehicle, Smalley broke four vertebrae
in his back, and nearly severed his left arm. He knew he would
live, but could he dance again?
</P>
<P>
   An avid and competitive dancer since his 20s, Smalley was
determined his feet would move to the music again. He threw himself
into rehabilitating his body at the VA hospital, taking it one day,
one step at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Four years after the accident, Smalley was dancing at the 1996
National Veterans Creative Arts Festival. He's back again this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get back here. For one, it's free,'' said Smalley,
giving his partner Lynn Bronkar a wink.
</P>
<P>
   ``But mainly, it's for the experience you gain here from others
who have changed their lives and redeveloped through their
creativity. It's so stimulating and nourishing. It evokes something
in me that's inspirational.''
</P>
<P>
   In another room, Charlie ``Taps'' DiMura was showing off his
pink umbrella to onlookers. This is the fourth year that the
74-year-old Korean War veteran was picked to perform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Singing and dancing are the only joy I get out of life now,''
said DiMura, who checked into the VA hospital after a nervous
breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I burned myself out,'' he explained. While recovering at a VA
hospital in the early 1990s, he learned about the festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this event is what has kept my youth,'' said the New
Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   In the gymnasium of the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, artwork
by 39 of the festival veterans has been on display all week. Among
the exhibits are Houstonian Glenda Horton's ceramic southwestern
bean pot, Californian Clayton Johnston's hummingbird woodcarving
and Kentuckian Larry House's cowboy sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   Near the front hangs a cross-stitching of pink flowers
surrounded by colorful butterflies and a hummingbird. In the left
bottom corner, there's an inscription:
</P>
<P>
   ``When I am down, I try to focus on the colorful memories of the
past and the beauty of life to ease the present tribulation.''
</P>
<P>
   The words are by Army veteran Wayne Richardson, the man who did
the needlework. The piece is dedicated to the memories of his wife,
Judith Ann Miller, and his daughter, Cynthia Ann Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me 10 years to accept the fact that my wife was
buried. When my 19-year-old daughter died, that took everything
away that I had,'' Richardson said. ``I gave up my will to live.
There was no end to the glass pit that I was in, a glass pit with
grease on the walls.''
</P>
<P>
   In a deep state of depression, Richardson lost his landscaping
business and health. He checked into the VA hospital in Seattle in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Bedridden, he decided it would be an ideal time to take up
cross-stitching once again.
</P>
<P>
   His mother had taught him to darn socks when he was a boy. After
his 27-year-old wife died in 1971, he took up cross-stitching so he
could teach their young daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``People started complimenting my work. It made me feel really
good about life again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson is already working on his next project. ``It's a
peacock tapestry, but I've nicknamed it the `Parakeet on Steroids.'
Its legs are huge,'' he said with a hearty laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stitching relieves a lot of tension,'' the 60-year-old said.
``It keeps your mind off the troubles of the world. You get
engrossed in the needlework because if you forget which symbol
you're on, you're shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the rehearsal room, Holloway was singing ``Jesus, You're
The Center of My Joy'' with partners Michael Slatton and Sidney
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   This is the fourth time Holloway has participated in the
festival since 1994. The only time he didn't make it was in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live for this, and when I didn't make it that one year, I
volunteered to help,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't imagine how important this event is for some guys.
Over the years, I've sung in front of many celebrities. But all of
that doesn't compare to this _ this is for my country, this is for
the guys I served with, the guys that didn't come back.'' &QL;

WHEN RAGWEED ATTACKS YOUR EYES, IT'S TIME FOR EYE DROPS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LESLIE SOWERS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   First it's a little tickle and you ignore it. Instead of going
away, it gets worse, and the itch gets ferocious. You try not to
scratch. This is no mosquito bite on your ankle.
</P>
<P>
   When it's your eyes that itch, scratching seems like a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   With weeks to go before the ragweed ends its fall riot, it's
time for eye drops _ one more weapon in the allergy armory.
</P>
<P>
   Itchy eyes often signal an allergic reaction to contact with
allergens such as dust, animal hair and pollen. Like a runny nose,
a wheezy cough or a ballistic sneeze, eyes made itchy by allergy
can be helped by taking antihistamine capsules or tablets.
</P>
<P>
   But these alone may not relieve the wickedly itchy eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may need to use eye drops for a local allergic reaction,''
said Benjamin Interiano, associate professor of medicine at Baylor
College of Medicine in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure your drops contain antihistamine or they won't help
the itching caused by allergies. Some drops aren't intended for
allergy, but to help with dry or irritated eyes. Since the itching
may also be caused by infection or a dry eye, make certain that
allergy is the culprit.
</P>
<P>
   Over-the-counter eye drops that contain antihistamines include
Naphcon-A, Naphoptic-A, Naphazoline Plus, Opcon-A and Vasocon-A.
Each of these except Opcon-A have generic equivalents, according to
the Methodist Hospital Drug Information Center. Your doctor may
prescribe an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Interiano said cold weather will tame the pollens that have been
particularly heavy this year after a mild winter. He suggests
avoiding early morning outdoor exposure, when pollens are at their
worst. Unless, of course, you are out so early that dew will keep
the pollen down. Late afternoon is the best time to be out, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Three other very common conditions can also cause itchy eyes,
said Baylor ophthalmologist Eric Holz.
</P>
<P>
   Women are particularly susceptible to dry eye, he said. When the
eye gets dry and irritated, he said, eye drops designed to clear
redness can actually make the condition worse because the
decongestant in them causes the blood vessels in the eye to
overdilate as the drops wear off.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of routine use of eye drops, the solution for dry eyes
is artificial tears, Holz said. These are available over the
counter.
</P>
<P>
   Blepharitis is another extremely common condition, Holz said.
The culprit here is a bacterial infection of the tiny oil glands in
the eye lids that interferes with the proper coating of the eye.
This is a chronic but treatable condition, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cleansing the eyelids with no-sting baby shampoo or a special
eyelid scrub will remove the grit, debris and bacteria that build
up.
</P>
<P>
   Holz said contact lens wearers must be careful about redness and
irritation because it can indicate an allergy to the contact lens
solution, to the protein buildup on the lens or to the composition
of the lens itself. This can lead to very serious eye infections.
If taking the contacts out for a while doesn't take care of the
problem, he suggests a visit to the optometrist or ophthalmologist.
</P>
<P>
   Out of drops and your eyes are driving you crazy?
</P>
<P>
   It's not professional advice, but Lenz said that occasional
moderate rubbing of the eyes probably won't damage them unless
you've had recent surgery. &QL;

`VELVET GOLDMINE' LOOKS AT GLITTERING ROCK MUSIC OF THE '70S 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOEY GUERRA 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The spirits of David Bowie, Iggy Pop and other glam-rock
luminaries loom large over Todd Haynes' ``Velvet Goldmine,'' a
fictionalized, visually intoxicating look inside the glittering
hallways of an era in music that blurred the lines of gender and
sexuality for a few brief moments in the early '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes' protagonist, Brian Slade (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), is the
sequined superstar in this moody and musical work. At the height of
his fame, Slade indulges in a misguided publicity stunt that brings
his career to an abrupt end. (Revealing the specifics of the
incident would dull some of the film's shimmer.)
</P>
<P>
   Years later, a young journalist (Christian Bale) attempts to
expose the lurid melodramas played out behind Slade's temperamental
onstage demeanor. Those include the star's relationships with wife
Mandy (Toni Collette), a glamorous party girl; and American rock
star Curt Wild (Ewan McGregor), a source of obsessive inspiration
for Slade.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes, whose previous work includes the cult classic
``Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story'' and the acclaimed indie
hits ``Poison'' and ``Safe,'' welcomes the parallels many critics
and audiences have drawn between his film and real elements of the
glam-rock era.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's inevitable. It will be something that I can't deny or
escape from,'' Haynes said during a recent visit to Houston. ``I
just think the richest way of reading the film is one in which you
don't even take David Bowie as a fixed, factual, stable, initial
thing to begin with, because he, of course, was Davy Jones, and
then David Bowie, and then Ziggy Stardust ... and maybe Brian Slade
is just one more version of David Bowie. Of course, that's gonna
haunt the film, but in a way, it's fine. David Bowie's mark on this
period is so profound and so pervasive and so important that
there's no way of avoiding David Bowie.''
</P>
<P>
   Haynes began working on ``Velvet Goldmine'' in the early '90s,
fresh off the success of ``Poison.'' He put the idea on the back
burner when he began work on ``Safe,'' and until the script was
finally ready, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impetus came from my love of the music, which happened
after the glam era itself, because I was a little bit young for it.
By the time I was in college at Brown University in the early '80s,
I was fully involved in Roxy Music, David Bowie, Iggy Pop, Lou
Reed, all of it, really,'' Haynes said. ``It's such an incredibly
visual period of rock 'n' roll, maybe one of the most, and
theatrical and narrative in ways that lend themselves to film.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond music, Haynes looked to other trappings of the era:
``literature, movies, Warhol and his whole philosophy and team. I
basically retraced the steps that Bowie himself and Brian Ferry
took to arrive at what they created in the early '70s. So it was
going back to Noel Coward for Brian Ferry and Oscar Wilde ... but
also looking at films from the late '60s that had inspired a lot of
these artists, like `Performance,' `Clockwork Orange,' `2001' and
Hollywood _ classic Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole notion of glamour as it's sort of depicted in films
from the '30s and '40s, Marlene Dietrich, Garbo, Valentino ... All
of those looks, styles, even just the costumes alone became really
important influences.''
</P>
<P>
   Haynes received a superstar boost from R.E.M.'s Michael Stipe.
Haynes had met Stipe, a Haynes fan, a decade earlier. They reunited
by chance as Stipe began to express interest in developing films
through his Single Cell production company, which helped bring
``Velvet Goldmine'' to the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Michael) really played the role of executive producer,''
Haynes said. ``When financing with New Line fell through, he went
out, took meetings on his own in L.A. pitching the film. When it
came to the musical side, it was a gift to have him there, because
it meant we could get anybody we wanted. He was very sensitive and
deferential to me about not wanting to presume his role or his
opinion too much. He was really, really sweet.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Haynes hopes audiences can connect with his film on
a number of levels, but the true test of success is within his own
range of talents.
</P>
<P>
   ``My films are always very intense experiments, more to myself
than anything. I'm trying something I've never done before, I've
never really seen before, and that's the excitement, but it's also
the fear,'' Haynes said. ``(My films) work for some people, and
they don't for others, but at a certain point, I will feel, `OK, I
think it's working. I think it's communicating those ideas.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I was making a narrative that was not a traditionally deep
story. Very much like a musical, in that the story itself is not
really what you're going for. That's what I wanted to bring to this
film _ have it be all artificial and surfaces and about these
seemingly superficial themes, but having you understand it
emotionally and feel for it emotionally, but not get it from the
typical ways that we understand depth from most movies.'' &QL;

QUEEN OF THE BLUES SAYS AS LONG AS SHE CAN OPEN HER MOUTH, SHE'LL
SING THE BLUES 

</HEADLINE>
 -HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARTY RACINE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The Queen of the Blues has just arrived at her
Virginia hotel room, toting a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken.
</P>
<P>
   A bucket here and there is to be expected from KoKo Taylor, a
veteran who performs 200 dates a year. Her life is a series of
airports and bus stations, hotels and fast-food joints.
</P>
<P>
   ``My doctor tells me to lay off fried foods,'' says Taylor,
munching away. ``But it's hard to eat right. You have to eat what
you can get, so I'm sittin' here eatin' some chicken. It is very
tasty.''
</P>
<P>
   A diabetic, she must also avoid sweets, not easy for a woman
named Cora who received her nickname KoKo (cocoa) for her love of
chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmmm-mmm,'' she purrs at the mention.
</P>
<P>
   But where others may fry from the friction of constant motion,
the road instills in blues shouters a cool resolve that informs
their music. Taylor, pushing 70, is at the peak of her career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to slow down,'' she says in an unguarded moment.
</P>
<P>
   But, she adds quickly, ``I'm doing something that I love. I look
forward to coming out here, going onstage. I'm doing what Koko
wants to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor grew up as Cora Walton on a sharecropper's cotton farm
outside Memphis, Tenn. Her home had no electricity or running
water. But she did hear the likes of Bessie Smith and Muddy Waters
on the radio. One of the disc jockeys was a gentleman named B.B.
King.
</P>
<P>
   On Sundays, she sang in the church. On Stormy Mondays, she
belted out blues around the farm _ hopefully out of earshot.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father, if he catch us singing the blues, we'd get a good
beatin'. He said that was the devil's music. He said that was ugly
in the eyes of God.''
</P>
<P>
   So she and her brothers would jam behind the house, in the
woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sent us to pick blackberries, we'd be down there pickin'
and singin','' Taylor says. While she sang, her brothers played a
guitar fashioned out of baling wire and a corncob harmonica.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ain't got nothin' else coming, you learn how to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Scrapping for a living left her humble. Taylor, who owns a home
in Chicago that exceeds anything she imagined, hasn't forgotten her
upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me appreciate everything I've got, everything I do.
It makes me reach out to people less fortunate than I am.''
</P>
<P>
   She does benefits for the homeless and various foundations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need help,'' Taylor says simply.
</P>
<P>
   In Memphis, she knew Robert Taylor, a neighborhood boy. He was
12 years older, but when he told her he was going to Chicago to get
a good job, she replied, ``Not without me.'' He and Taylor, then
18, took a northbound Greyhound with 35 cents and a box of Ritz
crackers between them. When they got to the Windy City, they were
astonished. The city was wired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got to 63rd Street, saw all them lights, I said, `Good God,
this must be heaven.' ''
</P>
<P>
   After a quickie wedding in Indiana, they settled on the South
Side. Robert Taylor got a job at the Wilson meat-packing plant, and
Koko Taylor went to work as a maid for a wealthy suburban family.
She earned $5 a day. She used to get $3 a week picking cotton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were doing all right for ourselves,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   On the weekends, they'd blow off steam in the raucous nightclubs
that dotted the South and West sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just carrying on, drinkin' whiskey, eatin' catfish. And all
the guys we'd used to hear on the radio were right there in
Chicago: Howlin' Wolf, Elmore James, Magic Slim.''
</P>
<P>
   On occasion, Pops, as Robert Taylor was now called, would brag,
``My wife can sing.'' So she'd get invited to sit in for a number
or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shamed. I'd sing with my eyes closed. Old Howlin' Wolf
would say, `Come on up here, gal, we don't care if you close your
eyes, just sing them blues.' ''
</P>
<P>
   One night, Willie Dixon _ the legendary bandleader, songwriter
and producer _ was in the crowd. Following her blistering
performance, he introduced himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked if I had a contract with anybody. I didn't know what
he was talkin' about because I didn't know what a contract was.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the immortal words of the moment, he said, ``You got what
it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Dixon got her an audition with Chess Records, gave her material
_ including a song titled ``You Got What It Takes'' _ and had her
rehearse incessantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a great person, a hard-working person,'' Taylor
recalls. ``When he passed away it was like chopping off my right
arm because we had got to be like family.''
</P>
<P>
   Dixon wrote Taylor's breakout song, ``Wang Dang Doodle.'' At the
time, Taylor thought it was silly and was embarrassed to sing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where you get this song?'' she says she asked him the night he
called her over to his little basement studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What were you thinkin' about?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   His reply: ``Money.''
</P>
<P>
   When it hit No. 1, Taylor was shocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when they told me about it, I said, `Y'all must be
talkin' about the Temptations or something.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But in the 1960s, black audiences forsook the blues in droves.
Taylor doesn't begrudge them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blues is a reminder of hard times, slavery and just bein'
black. Automatically, the black people don't need to be reminded of
the way it was. We been there, we lived that. We don't want to
hear, `I cried like a baby.' I want to hear some jump for joy.''
</P>
<P>
   A huge white audience filled the void.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the white artists were recording the black people's
songs. Eric Clapton. A lot of those English guys. It was good
music. I'm glad they did it because it helped open a lot of doors
for me and other blues artists.''
</P>
<P>
   On Chicago's North Side, the Wise Fools Pub (then Kingston
Mines) started booking blues bands.
</P>
<P>
   ``From that day forward, I was just going in white clubs,''
Taylor says.
</P>
<P>
   Concurrently, she established herself as a recording mainstay on
Chicago's Alligator Records. But for all its resiliency, the blues
still struggles for airplay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody rapping, riff-raffin', whatever,'' Taylor says.
``But as long as I open my mouth to sing, it's always going to be
blues.''
</P>
<P>
   So it's back to the road. But the highway exacts its toll. Pops
was at the wheel in 1988 when Taylor's tour bus missed a turn and
rolled down a Tennessee mountain. He died of a heart attack a year
later. Taylor believes he never fully recovered from the traumatic
accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that his spirit is right here with me,'' she says.
``While I'm sitting here eating this chicken, he knows I'm getting
ready to go do my show tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing he told me, I told him I was going to quit the
road, he said, `Uh-uh. I'll be dead and gone, but I want you to
keep on doin' what you doin'. You love what you doin' too much.
Don't give it up.' After he died, I remembered what he said. And
that's what kept me out here.'' &QL;

   CAMBODIA-AID (PHNOM PENH, Cambodia) The international community
has pumped more than $3 billion in aid into Cambodia over the past
decade, but the impoverished and politically divided nation remains
the basket case of Southeast Asia. Riddled with corruption and
accused of numerous human rights violations, the government of
Prime Minister Hun Sen has been denied international recognition
following recent elections that the opposition says were marred by
fraud and intimidation. The political stalemate brought thousands
of demonstrators into the streets, sparking a bloody government
crackdown that sent many opposition members into exile and left
scores of people missing or dead. Among those caught up in
Cambodia's seemingly endless downward spiral is a former Seattle
refugee counselor who says he has returned to his homeland to fight
for democracy and human rights. But, just in case, he has retained
his U.S. passport.

   CAMBODIA-NEWSPAPER (PHNOM PENH, Cambodia) Publishing a fair and
objective newspaper in one of the world's most politicized,
polarized and violent societies is often difficult, sometimes
dangerous and always rewarding, according to Cambodia Daily deputy
editor Jeff Hodson, who grew up in Seattle and worked as a
journalist in Chicago for 10 years before dropping everything and
moving to Phnom Penh. Hodson, 36, says he joined the tiny paper's
highly-motivated staff -- about half foreign and half Cambodian --
because he needed a change and wanted to do some good in a society
that has seen more than its fair share of bad.

   JEFFERSON-HEMINGS-RELATIVE (Issaquah, Wash.) Five-year-old
Rebecca Westerinen believed the family oral history she learned

Jefferson and Sally Hemings begot Eston, who begot Beverly, who
bore Carl, who begot William, who begot Julia, who in turn bore
William, young Rebecca's dad.

<P>
   TULTEPEC, Mexico _ Within minutes of the searing blast that
leveled a city block and killed six people here on a cloudy,
mid-October morning, most residents knew what they had to do.
</P>
<P>
   Their collective action was not discussed, yet people moved
swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   By the time rescue workers and a horde of radio, television and
newspaper reporters from nearby Mexico City arrived at the
outskirts of this city of 40,000, they found a human chain
determined to keep them out.
</P>
<P>
   For hours, all the outside world knew was the long-lens
television images from hovering helicopters. Those who would speak
to an outsider said only that a gas tank had exploded.
</P>
<P>
   Fiery accidents are common in Tultepec, Mexico's self-proclaimed
``Capital of Fireworks,'' and the Mexican press regularly spreads
lurid accounts of deaths, injuries and the city's clandestine
workshops across the front pages of tabloids and scandal sheets.
</P>
<P>
   This time, with the biggest blast residents of Tultepec have
ever witnessed, people knew that a centuries-old way of life was at
risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty percent of the people here dedicate themselves to
fireworks, and every time there is an accident, they put the
responsibility on us,'' said Dionisio Silva Fragoso, 39.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't like it that (the press) doesn't tell our side of the
story, so (now) we don't let people in to see what we're about,''
Silva said from the mud-and-rubble plot where his home stood before
last month's explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans, fireworks and the craftspeople who make them share an
intimate, complex, relationship dating to the Spanish colonial days
in the 1600s, said Alejandro Guzman Contreras, a Mexico City
cultural anthropologist who has written three books on Mexican
fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   While no Mexican celebration _ religious, patriotic or social _
is complete without a fireworks show, their very explosive nature
makes accidents fodder for journalists eager to count bodies, point
fingers and forget the fine points, Guzman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When fireworks are burned successfully, no one writes about
it, but when there are accidents, the press comes to count the
victims and scream at the guilty parties,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   From the air, Tultepec is one more small city rapidly being
swallowed by the Mexico City megalopolis. But in its soul, it is
apart, closer to its distant ancestors than to its modern-day
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans pay for their romance with fireworks. Just two weeks
after the deadly explosion here on Oct. 13 that also injured 34
more, 16 people were badly burned by fireworks at a festival in
Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, three people were killed when an illegal home
fireworks factory blew up here; in December 1988, a Mexico City
marketplace where illegal fireworks were sold exploded, killing 62
and injuring 83; and in 1984, more than 50 people were burned to
death when fireworks stored in a church caught fire during a
saint's day celebration in Santa Cruz Tlapacaya.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are the people of Tultepec well aware of the danger of
their trade, they wear it like a badge of courage, said Manuel
Gonzalez Navarro.
</P>
<P>
   Over generations, the hazards of blending gunpowder and other
explosive chemicals into stupendous, multicolored offerings to God,
saints and the temporal powers-that-be have been incorporated into
the town's collective consciousness, said Gonzalez, a social
psychologist at Metropolitan Autonomous University in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   ``That legacy of common danger unites them, shaping their
personal, familial and social lives; it informs their religious and
political institutions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As with the insistence that the explosion must have been caused
by a gas leak rather than a fireworks accident, ``They will protect
that identity by lying to the outside world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30,000 people in Tultepec derive their living from
fireworks, according to Mayor Dionicia Vazquez Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   Vazquez, a tall, middle-aged woman elegant in a gray skirt and
sweater, is one of the 325 people here licensed by the Defense
Secretariat to buy explosives and mix them for fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   Tultepec is a one-industry town based on two lines of endeavor,
Vazquez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are dedicated to making celebrations,'' she explained. ``We
make music and fireworks.''

   Born of a family of traveling musicians, Vazquez married a
``pirotecnico,'' or a fireworks maker, and took up her life's work.
</P>
<P>
   While she conceded that fireworks probably were part of the
recent explosion, she insists that clandestine factories do not
exist in downtown Tultepec, and that most of the danger is confined
to an area set aside on the city outskirts.
</P>
<P>
   There, on two large plots, the fireworks makers construct simple
concrete-block buildings. Electricity, which might spark, is
prohibited, so all work is done in daylight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here the permit holders do the dangerous work, mixing the
explosives by hand at dawn, before it gets too hot,'' the mayor
explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most dangerous part is mixing the explosives. We are not
studied people or chemists; oftentimes we don't know what is going
to happen,'' she said. ``But we accept the risk. It is what we have
always done.''

   Like corn and beans, fireworks are part of the fabric of Mexico.
But Sergio Gudino Valencia said he would like to make the
manufacture of fireworks a little safer.
</P>
<P>
   Gudino heads the Mexico state disaster relief agency that helped
dig the dead and wounded from the rubble here last month.
</P>
<P>
   For openers, Tultepec needs a fire department, Gudino said. The
town has no fire trucks, and only four volunteer firemen. Fire
engines now must come from the neighboring town of Tultitlan, eight
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Education and better working techniques will make production in
Tultepec safer, but its insular society is tough to penetrate,
Gudino said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem with Tultepec is that the work is done
clandestinely. We can't just go into houses looking for fireworks
makers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vazquez and Guzman say they expect the recent accident will
force changes in the way things are done. Despite the cordon that
kept the outside world at bay on Oct. 13, the pressure is on for
government to do something.
</P>
<P>
   And the explosion may have shaken something inside the people
here, who wrapped themselves in their courage for so many
generations, figuring that an occasional injury or death was the
price to be paid for making a living dangerously.

FOR CONGRESS, SOCIAL SECURITY TOPS THE AGENDA

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One of the top issues facing the newly elected
106th Congress, which convenes in January, will be how to preserve
the long-term stability of the Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties delayed the potentially fractious debate to avoid
fallout in Tuesday's mid-term elections. They wasted no time
squabbling Wednesday over who best could protect the public
retirement program, although neither party had yet to propose a
formal plan.
</P>
<P>
   The debate, with potential ramifications for nearly all
Americans, will compete for public attention with several other
issues that were considered in the current legislative session.
Several of the issues were not resolved, and others were killed by
the Republican majority or dropped amid the threat of a
presidential veto.
</P>
<P>
   Notable among the lingering issues are competing plans to
regulate managed health care programs. Lawmakers could not
reconcile their differences over the proposals this year, and it
remains to be seen whether the new Congress, which closely
resembles the current edition, will be more successful.
</P>
<P>
   How to allocate a rapidly expanding budget surplus will also
draw attention, with many Republicans pushing for tax cuts and
Clinton advocating saving much of the extra money until the Social
Security system is fixed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there is likely to be renewed debate over how to
improve public education, ensure the nation's military strength,
and protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of banning late-term abortions are expected to raise
the issue again, after Clinton vetoed a bill that passed the
current Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Also, supporters of a plan to overhaul the campaign finance
system are expected to try again after failing repeatedly in the
current session.

CALIFORNIA CONVENTION BID GETS A BOOST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and p coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With the outcome of Tuesday's elections,
California would seem to have clinched the 2000 Democratic National
Convention: control of the governor's office for the first time in
16 years, a new lieutenant governor who is now the nation's
highest-ranking state official of Hispanic descent, and a US Senate
triumph in a tight race.
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, a few snags, mainly Monica Lewinsky and a
Buddhist temple.
</P>
<P>
   Both caused trouble for the Democrats, one over White House sex,
the other over foreign campaign contributions involving Vice
President Al Gore. Both are said to make Gore nervous about setting
the convention in Los Angeles, since the city is home to both. And
as the putative nominee, he has the final say.
</P>
<P>
   But the latest election results may force Gore to swallow his
nervousness, several political analysts and state party leaders
said Wednesday. The Democrats' sweep of state races was too great,
their showing among women and Hispanic voters too substantial to
set it anywhere else now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, dear God, what more do you need to underscore the
resurgence of the Democratic Party?'' said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a
political scientist at Claremont Graduate University. ``This a
statement that they would want and need to showcase ... But it
depends on how self-confident Al Gore is about sending that message
from Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal is not clinched yet. Along with Boston, Los Angeles is
one of seven cities in the running. But Los Angeles, situated in
the most important electoral state, is certain to be on the list of
finalists announced next Thursday. Philadelphia, where black voters
have long backed Democrats, is also expected to make the cut.
Political observers described Boston's chances as solid but less
certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``California did itself no harm Wednesday with the extraordinary
wall-to-wall victories we achieved in what I can only describe as
the 800-pound gorilla of American politics,'' said Steve Grossman,
a Boston native who is chairman of the Democratic National
Committee. ``LA is going to be a major factor in this convention
decision-making process right to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   With 30 million-plus residents and 54 electoral votes,
California is more important politically than the six New England
states combined. It is also home to more Hispanics than any other
state, a demographic group being wooed strongly by both major
political parties. Major donors to the Democratic Party also live
here, among them David Geffen, cofounder of the Dreamworks SKG
movie studio, who helped put together the city's bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fundamentally this comes down to one simple fact: The
Democratic nominee for president cannot become president unless he
or she carries California,'' said Bill Wardlaw, a Los Angeles
lawyer who headed up Mayor Richard Riordan's efforts to win the
convention. ``Any successful strategy has to be based on securing
California as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   But DNC officials and others not involved in the selection
process stressed that numerous criteria go into the decision, from
availability of hotel rooms to transportation access to the design
of the convention facilities.
</P>
<P>
   One factor that could hurt California is a decision by voters
Tuesday to continue with open primaries, allowing anyone eligible
to vote to choose a candidate from any party -- a practice opposed
by the political parties themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we had such a big win here, such a comprehensive
one, obviously has a positive influence on picking Los Angeles for
the convention,'' said Bill Carrick, a Democratic media consultant.
``But it's not a given. My sense is that they're taking a hard look
at Los Angeles, Boston, and Philadelphia, which are all important
politically for different reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Leibowitz, Boston's director of intergovernmental
relations and Mayor Thomas M. Menino's point man on the convention
bid, said he remains convinced that the city is still in a close
race. Massachusetts' Democratic tradition is strong, he noted, and
on Tuesday Democrats carried ``everything that wasn't nailed down''
except the governorship.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of ways to reward a major state like
California besides a convention,'' said Leibowitz, such as
selecting US Senator Dianne Feinstein as the vice presidential
nominee in 2000. ``We still think Boston provides the best overview
of the accomplishments of the Democratic administration as we enter
the new millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, officials involved in the convention bid were
preparing to write letters and make telephone calls on the city's
behalf. Andy Spahn, an executive with Dreamworks, &UR;  &LR; said he and
others involved in the process want to ensure that national party
leaders know that Democrats held on to both the state Senate and
Assembly, and that a number of key leadership positions in both
houses are held by Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's obvious that the convention has to be here, in Al
Gore country, where people love him,'' said Art Torres, chairman of
the California Democratic Party. ``The temple and Monica Lewinsky
won't resonate with voters. If this election proved anything, it's
that the voters are smarter than people give them credit for.''

FOCUS SHIFTS TO PATAKI, GIULIANI 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and p coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With Alfonse D'Amato tossed out of power after an
18-year reign not only as US senator but also as kingmaker of the
New York Republican machine, all eyes are shifting to the state's
other two GOP powers, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and
Governor George W. Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are about the same age (54 and 53, respectively). Both
are lawyers, Roman Catholic, and relatively moderate on social
issues. And both are widely seen as holding ambitions for higher _
even the highest _ office.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki is the sharper object of focus this week, because, unlike
his onetime mentor D'Amato, he won his reelection battle Tuesday,
crushing Democratic challenger Peter Vallone 54-33, with a handful
of independent candidates dividing the remainder.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani won his second four-year term in the mayoral race last
year, but he gallivanted all over the country, campaigning for
several Republican candidates, D'Amato included.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Wednesday, Pataki waved off questions about
presidential prospects, though he has made no bones about them in
the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question,'' said one Republican political consultant, who
asked not to be identified, ``Pataki is on most people's
short-lists for president or vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Carroll, head of the Quinnipiac College Polling
Institute, asked, ``Why not? A northeastern, moderate, pro-choice
Catholic _ that sounds pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet others wonder whether Pataki was hurt or helped by Tuesday's
results.
</P>
<P>
   On a practical level, Democratic consultant Henry Sheinkopf
noted, D'Amato was going to be ``the man who would navigate Pataki
through the Washington corridors, through the PAC maze, through all
the fund-raisers.'' When D'Amato lost his Senate seat, Pataki
``lost his money man, and early money matters most of all in a
presidential campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   On a more analytic level, Pataki did not do as well himself as
his huge margin over Vallone suggests at first glance.
</P>
<P>
   First, he did not win New York City, though he very much hoped
to do so, as a display that he could carry the entire state.
</P>
<P>
   Second, statewide, Pataki won no more votes than he did in his
1994 squeaker over then-Democratic incumbent Mario Cuomo, about 2.4
million both on Tuesday and four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The difference this time was that his Democrat opponent received
so many fewer votes and the other, minor-party candidates,
especially the well-funded Independent Party candidate, Tom
Golisano, who picked up 350,000 votes, got so many more.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, though Pataki campaigned with D'Amato across the state
for four days solid, he could not help the man who pulled him out
of obscurity and made him governor four years ago hang on to his
seat.
</P>
<P>
   The scope and depth of D'Amato's defeat, at the hands of
Brooklyn Congressman Charles Schumer, was more profound than even
the decisive 54-44 vote count suggests.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato needed a big win upstate to offset Schumer's obvious
lead in the city. Yet, despite Pataki's own domination upstate,
D'Amato edged out Schumer there by a mere 5-to-4 margin.
</P>
<P>
   In the suburbs, where he also needed huge numbers, D'Amato held
a smaller lead still.
</P>
<P>
   And in New York City, where D'Amato needed to hang on to his
base support, Schumer crushed him, 3-to-1. Except for Staten Island
and two neighborhoods in Brooklyn, the Italian district of
Bensonhurst and the Orthodox Jewish enclave of Borough Park,
D'Amato did not win a single one of the city's Assembly districts.
</P>
<P>
   In several districts of Harlem, Washington Heights, and the
South Bronx, where black and Hispanic voters were galvanized by
President Clinton and union campaigns to turn out in greater
strength than usual, D'Amato lost by 10-to-1 margins or more.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki did much better than D'Amato everywhere, but, as several
analysts put it, he had no coattails. ``If he can't carry New York
state, not even upstate, for Alfonse D'Amato,'' one Republican
official put it, ``how can he carry it for George W. Bush,'' the
Texas presidential prospect who was handily reelected governor
Wednesday?
</P>
<P>
   However, another angle on the election figures puts Pataki in a
brighter light. The fact is, Pataki himself won every county
outside New York City. And even within the city, he cut into
Democratic strongholds.
</P>
<P>
   The proof is this: City voters favored Schumer over D'Amato by
600,000 votes, but they favored Vallone over Pataki by just
300,000. In other words, half of the city dwellers who voted for
Schumer split their tickets and pulled Pataki's lever for governor.
</P>
<P>
   This fact cannot help but intrigue Republican leaders who want a
candidate who can pull in urban Democrats and yet who find
Giuliani, a more high-profile possibility, a bit too personally
abrasive.

Faircloth's Capitol office. Faircloth, a hog farmer, was the

Hutchison, R-Texas, is the likely choice to fill Faircloth's slot

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES &UR;  &LR; _ ``fofo: EchoGreco,'' the visually astonishing
Dionysiac carnival playing at Hollywood's MET Theatre, is no
Grecian formula.
</P>
<P>
   Mixing performance art, sketch comedy, punk-vaudeville antics
and the seductive high-wire artistry of aerialist Montana Miller,
who has performed with Cirque du Soleil, this is a unique, if
incompletely realized and sometimes awkwardly executed
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously spoofing and celebrating all things Greek _ well,
ancient Greek anyway _ ``fofo: EchoGreco'' merits high marks for
its uninhibited artistic conception and its young cast's
what-the-hell high-spiritedness. To pull off such sustained
spectacle is a notable achievement. Evan A. Bartoletti's production
design of towering, diaphanous curtains, inscribed with scenic
artwork of nymphs, satyrs and Minotaurs by Francesco X. Siqueiros,
is simply gorgeous.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the show earns less enthusiasm for its frequently slipshod
writing and generally clumsy choreography, apart from Miller's
lyrically athletic Ariadne.
</P>
<P>
   Ariadne, you'll recall from Classics 101, was the beautiful
maiden imprisoned in a labyrinth by the cruel half-man, half-bull
minotaur and rescued by the heroic Theseus, only to be later
snatched up by Dionysius, god of love and libations.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Dionysius (Solomon Eversole) is depicted as a towering,
bulbous-headed cartoon clown (Joe Seely's masks are wonderful). He
doesn't get much to do, however, but preside mutely over the
ensuing variety-show bacchanal, which is amusingly goosed along by
geeky Professor Aeschylus (Paul Raczkowski).
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Theseus (Leif Tilden) is less a character threading
his way through a narrative than a frat boy fumbling along in a
free-form toga party.
</P>
<P>
   Though ``fofo: EchoGreco's'' anarchic appeal lies in its
essentially plotless structure, it could use stronger
characterizations and more thematic unity. Since its previous,
long-running incarnation last spring, the show has been nipped and
tucked, with its story line buffed up by its creators, MET artistic
director Thomas Dean Kellogg and associate artistic director Bari
Hochwald.
</P>
<P>
   Though they've gathered plenty of talent here, much of it put to
good use, the evening often feels like a series of talent-show acts
randomly adapted to sketches with titles like ``The Sirens'' or
``Eros and Thanatos'' (though Brandon Scott musters an eerie
presence in the latter as a sinister magician).
</P>
<P>
   In one of the more successful skits, a ``Miss Ancient Greece''
pageant, a frumpy plebian (Laurie Wollery) dukes it out with a
bare-breasted Helen of Troy (Erin Matthews), who imitates Marlene
Dietrich, breathily belting out ``I Love Paris'' (Paris, of course,
was Helen's Trojan lover).
</P>
<P>
   The final sequence, ``The Dismemberment,'' seems slightly off
the mark, because in Euripides' tragedy ``The Bacchae'' it's a
priggish moral guardian, not Dionysius, who gets torn limb from
limb by the wine god's frenzied female worshipers.
</P>
<P>
   Given America's current climate of sexual finger-wagging, maybe
this duality could furnish ``fofo: EchoGreco'' with a slightly
firmer conceptual spine. After all, it worked for Sophocles.

WHY DOES GEEKY `X-FILES' HAVE TO BE SO GOOD? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVE WALKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - If a visitor from another planet were to care enough
about television to monitor ``The X-Files,'' it would laugh long
and loud at our fascination with the show's never-ending
alien-invasion hook.
</P>
<P>
   ``A-ha, ha, ha, ha!'' it would say. ``Stupid Earthlings! A vague
hint here, a glimpse of some slimy creature there, and you're sated
until the next tiny bit of plot line is revealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every week it's the same: Talk, talk, talk. Walk down a dark
corridor with your flashlight flashing. Boo! Talk, talk, talk on
your cell phone. Walk into a dark office with your flashlight
flashing. Boo! `Mulder, you scared me.' Argue with your superior.
Talk, talk, talk. `To be continued.'
</P>
<P>
   ``What a waste of carbon your species is!''
</P>
<P>
   Rupert Murdoch's Fox entertainment empire has proved itself
expert at shamelessly milking a cash cow to death. The clone farm
of ``reality'' programs in prime time is the most obvious example,
but ``The X-Files'' might be the most heinous.
</P>
<P>
   Pieces of the larger story puzzle are released drip by drip,
here via bonus musings from creator Chris Carter on a soundtrack
CD, there via a few extra seconds of footage in the video release
of ``The X-Files'' movie, itself a cynical exercise in delayed
gratification, with its Mulder-Scully near-kiss.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ``X-Files'' consumers are expected to keep spending
along at home. The series supposedly has one of the most loyal
audiences on television, though hardly the largest, but isn't
unthinking devotion the kind of trait most appreciated by weird
cult leaders?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe most offensive, at least to casual viewers, is the series'
chronically late season premiere. Practically half the new fall
shows have been canceled already. Now, finally, comes the beginning
of ``The X-Files'' sixth season, with the promise of maybe figuring
out what this truly loony show is about.
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't so well done, we'd never put up with it.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there are a couple of bonuses in Sunday's
late-fall, near-winter premiere.
</P>
<P>
   One is for Valley of the Sun viewers: It's set, in part, in the
Phoenix area. Specifically, a space critter runs wild over the
rolling hills of Mesa (yep, the rolling hills of Mesa) and through
the local nuclear plant (which has been relocated to way east of
town). Not to nag, but, huh?
</P>
<P>
   The other is a hilarious homage to one of the series'
network-mates.
</P>
<P>
   This episode also officially marks ``The X-Files'' shift from
its frequently frosty production base in Vancouver, British
Columbia, to southern California. The opening shot, in fact,
celebrates the move with a long gaze directly into the desert sun.
Now fewer bit players will have Canadian accents.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, this hour's job is to tie up some of the loose ends
from last spring's season finale, in which the spooky documents
known as the X-Files were seemingly (oops!) destroyed, as well as
from the summertime film, which tossed the show's
always-so-tired-looking stars all over the globe in search of
unlikely whatevers.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in all this episode's talk, talk, talk, a few of those
loose ends are undoubtedly knotted, but only the chat-room geeks
will know for sure. Probably already do.
</P>
<P>
   None of which means it's time to give up on this show, at least
until after Nov. 22. Written and directed by Carter, that night's
``X-Files'' finds Mulder aboard a cruise ship in the Bermuda
Triangle in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   Don't ``Huh?'' me. This very cool episode is a technical marvel,
as Carter's hand-held Steadicam runs wild following Mulder through
the ship's corridors, then tracks Scully up and down and around FBI
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the sequences appear to be (but probably aren't) long
single takes, and the action unfolds in real time. The period look
of the ocean liner at times gives the episode ``The Shining's''
chilly vibe, and the story, as dependably silly as ever, actually
delivers one bit of action, hinted at for seasons, that hard-co re
fans won't want to miss.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, the stronger episodes of ``The X-Files''
have been like this _ stand-alone creepfests that never refer to
the bigger aliens-among-us arc.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the season opener, it's possible to enjoy this episode
without having to refer to any printouts, World Wide Web pages or
secret microwave transmissions that only you, Chris Carter and
Rupert Murdoch's accountants can receive.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there's an alien concept. &QL;

TAUT THRILLER `SIEGE' USES SURE FIRE ELEMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Saying a movie is ripped from today's headlines often
implies that the filmmakers didn't have enough imagination to come
up with their own story.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ``The Siege,'' they let their imagination run
away with them. They should have stayed closer to the headlines.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins on sure ground: with the FBI battling
terrorists in a tale of intrigue as taut, suspenseful and global as
``A Clear and Present Danger.''
</P>
<P>
   But director Ed Zwick has big plans for his movie. He ventures
into uncharted territory: what happens when terrorists force the
U.S. government to declare martial law.
</P>
<P>
   At this point ``The Siege'' not only loses steam, it abandons
credibility, too. Too bad, because the first half of the movie is
played on a tight wire.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Hubbard (Denzel Washington) is the head of the FBI's
anti-terrorism unit. He faces the campaign of his life when a group
of Arab terrorists strikes against New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Their attack is not an isolated bombing but a full campaign of
terror that threatens the American way of life, as well as the
lives of thousands of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   As Hubbard and his agents rush to discover the identity of the
terrorists before they strike again, they cross paths with Elise
Kraft (Annette Bening), a CIA agent who presents as much of a
mystery to Hubbard as the terrorist cells.
</P>
<P>
   Up to this point, the manhunt is first-rate, full of twists and
tension, as sadly realistic as the dangerous, unstable world we
have created for ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   But Zwick then gambles by conjecturing about what would occur if
the U.S. government were pushed hard enough to declare martial law.
</P>
<P>
   When Gen. William Devereaux (Bruce Willis) leads his troops into
New York City to conduct a military campaign against the
terrorists, ``The Siege'' stumbles badly and comes away looking
paranoid and foolish.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to give away anything crucial from the plot because
I think ``The Siege'' is worth seeing despite its faults. But at
one point, Zwick conjectures the formation of a spontaneous
coalition of Blacks, Jews and Arabs in New York City to oppose the
Army in a protest for civil rights during a state of war.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City? Wouldn't happen on a holiday, much less during
a state of war.
</P>
<P>
   Political correctness is probably at the heart of Zwick's
problem. Because his villains are Arabs, he tries to head off
protests from Arab-Americans by creating a military scenario in
which fair play becomes a more critical factor than marksmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Zwick, who was on solid historical ground when he directed the
account of black Civil War soldiers in ``Glory,'' sacrifices the
suspense and credibility in ``The Siege'' in favor of big speeches
about political awareness, patriotism and personal rights.
</P>
<P>
   Although his story tends to deteriorate under pressure, Zwick's
ability to direct does not. His sense of drama draws strong impact
with minimal bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Siege'' is not a ``Die Hard'' kind of actioner based on
the idea that heroes can shoot their way out of anything. It's a
mental cat-and-mouse game, with some big scenes. Zwick favors
clever scene construction where other directors would have gone for
simple pyrotechnics.
</P>
<P>
   The performances are also outstanding. Washington is excellent,
but when isn't he? He creates the kind of leader within whose team
we'd be honored to serve.
</P>
<P>
   Bening (``The American President'') plays a different kind of
spy: crafty, contentious, hard. While adding the sexual tension to
a movie that doesn't have time for sex, Bening gives real character
to a role that would have been a throw-away with a lesser actress.
</P>
<P>
   Willis, as the general who doesn't want a command but fulfills
it, is able-bodied but really has a minor supporting role.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, to build up Willis' role, Zwick has his general in
command appear in all kinds of front-line operations that no
general since the Revolutionary War has participated in.
</P>
<P>
   It's that kind of foolishness that weakens what should have been
the best thriller of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Siege'' is rated R for violence, profanity, nudity and
sex. 3 stars. &QL;

DIRECTOR LAYS `SIEGE' TO OUR CHERISHED IDEALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edward Zwick's what-if terrorist epic, ``The Siege,'' has its
share of chilling moments, white-knuckle suspense sequences and
A-level movie-star power going for it. In the tradition of his
``Courage Under Fire,'' it's a dandy thinking man's popcorn movie.
</P>
<P>
   It also has a higher sensibility. It's a sober cautionary tale
about what a major terrorist campaign in the United States might do
to our national principles.
</P>
<P>
   And it's been getting a bum rap from American Islamic groups who
have mounted a large and apparently well-financed campaign against
it, even though its story line shows how the larger U.S. Muslim
community could become the scapegoat of such a terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it lacks the subtlety and irony it needs to be truly
special. It's entertaining and thought-provoking, but it tells its
story largely in terms of stock characters, predictable situations
and author's message speeches.
</P>
<P>
   The script follows a New York City FBI agent (Denzel Washington)
and his Lebanese American partner (Tony Shalhoub) as they're
confronted by a series of terrorist attacks of increasing
proportions _ and a population on the edge of panic.
</P>
<P>
   They're joined by, and are frequently at odds with, a mysterious
and somewhat promiscuous CIA operative (Annette Bening) who has a
background in the Middle East and seems to know more about the
organization of terrorists in Brooklyn than she lets on.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the mix is a cautious and prescient U.S. Army general
(Bruce Willis), who desperately pleads against calling in the Army
to handle the crisis, but who happily turns into a Nazi once
martial law is declared and no checks exist on his power.
</P>
<P>
   One problem with the film is that a good deal of it _ the
general's mood swing, the endless interagency rivalry and bickering
in the face of such an overwhelming crisis, America's descent into
total martial law after only three bombings _ is not always
dramatically convincing.
</P>
<P>
   And while the big point that Zwick makes _ that the worst
catastrophe of a major terrorist campaign probably would be what it
does to America's cherished ideals _ is certainly a valid one, it's
too bad he couldn't deliver it more subtly. We get the message
without the big speech.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this quibbling aside, ``The Siege'' is an exciting movie
from start to finish. As a director, Zwick's sense of pace, rhythm
and flow is flawless. His big set piece _ a New York City bus blown
up by a terrorist-suicide squad _ is numbing in its realism. His
movie is authentically scary.
</P>
<P>
   And if Willis doesn't quite work as a smug militarist,
Washington and Bening carry the movie with their affable star
power. Washington, the great Everyman of '90s movies, and Bening,
with her deliberately frumpy look and smile that lights up the
world, are arguably the two most totally appealing stars in
American film. They make an irresistible team.
</P>
<P>
   It's also hard to imagine how ``The Siege'' could be any more
ethnically sensitive than it is. It goes out of its way in almost
every scene _ almost to the point of clumsiness _ to remind us that
Islam is a great religion, that not all Muslims are fundamentalist
terrorists and that Muslim Americans must never become scapegoats
for America's endless succession of Mideast blunders.
</P>
<P>
   The Siege. Directed by Edward Zwick. Screenplay by Lawrence
Wright, Menno Meyjes and Zwick. Cast: Denzel Washington, Annette
Bening, Bruce Willis, Tony Shalhoub, Sami Bouajila. 20th

`LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL' SCORES A TRIUMPH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a comic actor in American films, the career of Italy's
Roberto Benigni has been distinctly underwhelming. His appearances
in American Indies (``Down By Law,'' ``Night On Earth'') have had
little impact and his one Hollywood star vehicle, 1993's ``Son of
the Pink Panther,'' bombed.
</P>
<P>
   But as a writer-director-star of such Italian comedies as
``Johnny Stecchino'' and ``The Monster,'' Benigni has steadily
built himself a growing international audience, even while most
critics have remained hostile to his rather broad and slapsticky
comedy style.
</P>
<P>
   With his latest Italian film, ``Life is Beautiful'' (``La Vita e
Bella''), Benigni seems to have finally scored an across-the-board
triumph. The film has not only been a box-office smash in Europe,
it's also won over the critics, who handed him the Grand Jury Prize
at Cannes last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Set in 1939, the film starts out as a light comedy about Guido
(Benigni), a life-affirming, Italian-Jewish waiter who _ in the
happy course of the first act of the film _ moves to a small Tuscan
town and embarks on a fairy tale romance with Dora, the local
schoolteacher (Benigni's regular co-star Nicoletta Braschi).
</P>
<P>
   Guido and Dora get married, open a book store and have a son,
Giosue (Giorgio Cantarini) _ oblivious to Fascism, World War II and
the antisemitism that is rising to a peak in Italy. But Guido and
his son are eventually arrested and dispatched to a concentration
camp; and Dora, who is his not Jewish, demands, and is allowed, to
go along.
</P>
<P>
   In the concentration camp, Guido tells his young son that the
entire experience is ``all a game'' and the rest of the movie
involves his campaign _ sometimes comic, sometimes not _ to keep
his young son blind to the unimaginable horror that is going on all
around them, and convinced that ``life is beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's a concentration camp comedy, and the riskiest
imaginable proposition to bring off. But the magic of the movie is
that, while Benigni never for one moment blinks at the nightmare of
the Holocaust, he makes his character's epic act of denial seem
both very funny and a moving triumph of the human spirit.
</P>
<P>
   In many of his earlier films, Benigni's manic style and
rubber-face mugging has often seemed too broad to endure for a
feature-length running time. But here, he's toned down his delivery
and pace considerably, and added a slight, almost imperceptible,
sweetness and gentility to the character that makes him come
marvelously to life.
</P>
<P>
   While his other comedies have often seemed scattered and clumsy,
``Life is Beautiful'' is filled with imaginative and subtle
touches, such as Guido's delightfully romantic horseback rescue of
Dora from the clutches of her Fascist fiancee, or his surprising
friendship with a kindly German doctor (Horst Buchholz) who comes
to represent the staggering banality of evil.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every movie Benigni has made has been described by his
publicists as ``Chaplinesque,'' but this is the first one that
genuinely fulfills the boast. It's exactly the inspired blend of
satire, physical comedy, social commentary, character perversity
and childlike innocence that was Chaplin at his best.
</P>
<P>
   Life is Beautiful. Directed by Roberto Benigni. Screenplay by
Vincenzo Cerami and Benigni. Cast: Benigni, Nicoletta Braschi,
Giorgio Cantarini, Horst Buchholz. Miramax. 116 minutes. In Italian
with English subtitles. Rated PG-13 for Holocaust theme.

UNIQUE STYLE RECOMMENDS `VELVET GOLDMINE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For some reason, dramatic movies that deal with rock 'n' roll
history tend to be box-office poison: Even such critically
acclaimed efforts as ``Great Balls of Fire,'' ``Backbeat'' and
Oliver Stone's ``The Doors'' have died a miserable death at the
turnstiles.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Todd Haynes' enjoyably eccentric look at the glitter rock
explosion of the early '70s, ``Velvet Goldmine,'' definitely seems
to be tempting the fates. It deals, in an incorrigibly enigmatic
fashion, with what is perhaps the most brief and obscure chapter in
all of rock history.
</P>
<P>
   Still, frustrating and obscure as it may be, the film has a
unique style, much of it mesmerizing, and its energy and gay sex
appeal could combine with the cult following for director Haynes
(``Poison,'' ``Safe'') to make it an art-house exception to the
rock-movie rule.
</P>
<P>
   Opening in the mid-'80s, the script follows the investigation of
a young journalist (Christian Bale) into the fate of Brian Slade
(Jonathan Rhys-Meyers), a famous English glam-rock star of the
early '70s who vanished from public view after a publicity stunt
went awry.
</P>
<P>
   Deliberately aping the premise, flash-back structure and even
individual scenes of ``Citizen Kane,'' Haynes follows the young
bisexual journalist as he interviews Slade's ex-wife (Toni
Collette), his ex-agent and discoverer (Michael Feast) and his
ex-male lover (Ewan McGregor) _ gradually piecing together the
story of Citizen Slade.
</P>
<P>
   Like Haynes' previous films, however, this one has a look and
feel that is not quite like anything else you may have experienced
before and owes nothing to Orson Welles. Haynes is at his best in
creating his own unique world of outsiders, and shaping the
performances to fit it. It's very distinctive. (The word
``Haynesian'' seems destined for a place in the movie dictionary
alongside Hitchcockian, Lynchian and Fellinesque.)
</P>
<P>
   His films also tend to be all subtext, and, without trying very
hard, ``Velvet Goldmine'' wonderfully captures the visceral appeal
of glam-rock and the thrilling sense of liberation that David
Bowie, Iggy Pop, Roxy Music etc. communicated by abandoning, then
stomping on, the cult of macho in that unique moment of rock
history.
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad Haynes didn't strive to be a bit more historically
accurate in other ways. Veterans of the early '70s will blink at
the '90s VCRs in the background, a succession of glam-rock music
videos (which didn't exist at the time) and the spectacle of
top-billed McGregor clearly but anachronistically modeling his
character after Kurt Cobain.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad also that the film ends so badly, can't ultimately
deliver on its fascinating buildup, and is held together by a
particularly pretentious linking device _ a magical pendant handed
down by Oscar Wilde _ that never makes much metaphoric sense. In
the end, ``Velvet Goldmine'' becomes a tantalizing, magnificently
mounted shaggy dog story.
</P>
<P>
   Velvet Goldmine. Directed and written by Todd Haynes. Produced
by Christine Vachon. Cast: Ewan McGregor, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers,
Toni Collette, Christian Bale. Miramax. 127 minutes. Rated R for
language, sex scenes and nudity.

WELLES CLASSIC GETS A TOUCH-UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON RENFROE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - In the depths of film noir's black heart lies a film
that incorporates all the wonderful nastiness of the genre: Orson
Welles' 1958 classic, ``Touch of Evil.'' The bordertown story of
corruption, depravity and fear returns in a version re-edited to
more closely reflect Welles' vision.
</P>
<P>
   This posthumous ``director's cut'' contains about 50 changes _
some large, some small _ suggested by Welles during the editing of
the film but never carried out until now. Those familiar with the
film will notice changes right away, for they begin in its
groundbreaking opening sequence, a classic 3-minute, 17-second
take.
</P>
<P>
   The plot of Touch of Evil goes like this: In a Mexican border
town, a bomb is planted in a car, which explodes, killing its two
passengers. It just so happens that Mexican narcotics officer Mike
Vargas (Charlton Heston) and his bride, Susan (Janet Leigh), are
honeymooning there, and witness the explosion. Vargas feels
compelled to join in the investigation of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Vargas soon comes face-to-face with American police Capt. Hank
Quinlan (Orson Welles), a mountain of a man in more ways than one.
Revered and feared on the border, Quinlan takes control of the
murder case. The two officers at first agree to cooperate, but soon
Vargas suspects Quinlan of being a corrupt evidence-planter.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the border town's biggest underworld family, the
Grandis, seek revenge against Vargas, who has targeted them in
Mexico City. The Grandis try to get at Vargas by terrorizing Susan.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the effort to bring Welles' original vision to the film
was producer Rick Schmidlin, who got involved after seeing a
transcript of a 58-page memo written by Welles and sent to
Universal after the studio's edit of the film.
</P>
<P>
   Universal failed to carry out Welles' suggestions, and even
called in another director to add scenes intended to clarify plot
points.
</P>
<P>
   Since the debut of this new cut in September, many film writers
around the country have made Universal out to be the bad guy. But
Welles must share some of the blame for the studio taking the film
out of his hands in post-production.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as shooting was over, Welles flew off to act in another
film, leaving the studio little choice other than to begin editing.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Welles' 58-page memo was ``cautious,''
according to Schmidlin, not arrogant. Welles was not trying to make
the film wilder or more extreme _ quite the opposite, he was trying
to make its convoluted plot more accessible to the average
moviegoer, Schmidlin says.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing the new cut, it's clear the studio would've had a
better movie if it had carried out Welles' suggestions. As it was,
the film did poorly at the box office, often running as a second
feature.
</P>
<P>
   How much difference is there between the original 95-minute
version and the new 112-minute version? Heston, in a recent Phoenix
interview, says there is not ``a chasm of difference'' between the
two. Schmidlin disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There (begin ital) is (end ital) a great chasm of difference''
between the studio cut and what Welles wanted, he said in a recent
phone interview. ``When (Heston) saw (the recut) ``Touch of Evil,''
he hadn't seen it in 30 years. Because the cohesion is so much
better, it gives the impression that not much has changed from the
original.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the story does make more sense. For instance, through
the intercutting of the explosion investigation with Susan's
harassment at the hands of the Grandis, we see a clearer connection
_ and brewing confrontation _ between the bad guys and good-guy
Vargas.
</P>
<P>
   Some scenes, or pieces of scenes, were excised, some moved
around. All the changes that a fan can pick up seem to help. Making
the flow seem effortless was film editor Walter Murch, who won an
Academy Award for his work on ``The English Patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Just seeing this classic on a big screen would be treat enough
for film buffs, as its wonderfully sinister cinematography comes to
life much better in that medium.
</P>
<P>
   Adding substantially to the pleasure is Welles' superb opening
tracking shot, now without the hindrances of titles or theme music
that exist in the originally released version.
</P>
<P>
   Running without a cut for 3 minutes 17 seconds, the take far
outshines the much-ballyhooed long take at the beginning of this
summer's ``Snake Eyes.'' What director Welles did with restraint
and style, ``Snake Eyes'' director Brian DePalma did with a
sledgehammer. Welles' long take moves with balletic grace through a
sultry nightscape and demands the viewer's attention. DePalma's
scene depicts events at a boxing match that are less than riveting.
</P>
<P>
   During ``Touch of Evil's'' opening sequence, we see a bomb made
ready; the bomb planted by a shadowy figure; our main characters
appear; the scene of much of the film's action established ; and
the bomb exploding.
</P>
<P>
   That's more exposition in 3-plus minutes than most directors
provide in a half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scene took all day to rehearse and all night to shoot,''
Heston recalled. The camera begins tight on the bomb, moves back,
moves up, up, pans across _ all in a seemingly effortless sweep as
it follows the car that contains the bomb in its trunk.
</P>
<P>
   We feel we are flying over this seedy town that's both familiar
and foreign at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tour-de-force made even better with seemingly natural
sound effects: the tick of the bomb, car doors slamming, music
spilling from bars, shouts across the street. Most of that was lost
in the original version, masked by Henry Mancini's high-tempo
soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   All the acting in ``Touch of Evil'' is first-rate. With fake
nose and padded body, Welles is a hulking, threatening presence.
Heston, cast against type as the Mexican law enforcement officer,
has one of his best roles. Welles seems to have given Heston free
rein, especially as the angry husband defending his wife's honor.
Heston was always good at rage, and he really gets to rage here.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh excels at showing genuine terror as the Grandi gang gives
her one harrowing motel stay.
</P>
<P>
   The supporting cast is marvelous. Marlene Dietrich plays an old
acquaintance of Quinlan's: a seen-it-all bar owner. She has some of
the best lines in the film.
</P>
<P>
   There's also Dennis Weaver (yes, (begin ital) that (end ital)
Dennis Weaver, who would later star in TV's ``McCloud'') as the
whacked-out, paranoid motel night manager. He creates his own kind
of terror for Vargas. Imagine trying to find your spouse when the
only help you get is this loony who keeps saying things like, ``If
they think I'm gonna clean up that mess, they got another thing
comin'!''
</P>
<P>
   Schmidlin says ``Touch of Evil'' is catching on with a younger,
film-savvy audience. With all the junk that hits the screens these
days, ``what's appealing to audiences is to sit back and enjoy a
serious piece of work,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And, after talking to a number of Welles' close friends and
co-workers, Schmidlin feels certain that Welles would be happy with
the re-edit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Touch of Evil'' is unrated. It contains violent scenes that,
while mild by contemporary standards, probably would frighten
children. 5 stars. &QL;

`THE ALARMIST' IS DREADFUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This week's low-budget, American Independent black comedy by a
first-time director is called ``The Alarmist,'' and it's as
dreadful as anything we've had in this overworked movie genre all
year long. It's the 1998 equivalent of ``Keys to Tulsa'' or
``Killing Zoe.''
</P>
<P>
   At its core is the kernel of a fairly sound idea _ the moral
dilemma of a novice home-security-system salesman who basically has
to sell fear to his customers. But writer-director Evan Dunsky is
at a loss to make anything vaguely interesting out of it.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a better-than-usual _ and totally convincing _
performance by Stanley Tucci as an incorrigibly amoral scumbag of a
sales manager. In a better movie, this might have been the role of
Tucci's career. But it too goes nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   The hero is Tommy (David Arquette), a well-meaning and gifted
young salesman who is the protege of Heinrich (Tucci), the
fast-taking hustler of a sales executive who is not above breaking
into his potential customer's homes late at night to scare them
into a sale.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy's moral crisis comes when he learns that his mentor may be
up to even worse. He may be up to a large-scale burglary
conspiracy, and perhaps even to the murder of the sexy widow (Kate
Capshaw) who has become the love of Tommy's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Alarmist'' has too many problems to go into (not the least
of which is the fact that it's not funny). But a big one is the
fact that star Arquette, who comes across as a strange blend of
Charles Grodin and Pee-wee Herman, has none of the qualities of a
leading man and few skills as a comic actor.
</P>
<P>
   The movie also sinks in its own adolescent vulgarity, as in the
lengthy scene in which Capshaw's teenaged son describes in lurid
detail how he deflowered a virgin (heh-heh); or Capshaw's crude
monologue about how her vagina got athlete's foot.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse is the fact that Dunsky's idea of black humor is to
have his single sympathetic character brutally murdered and then
spend the rest of the movie making stupid jokes about it _ even the
final title card can't resist elbowing us about it one last time.
The movie is truly pathetic.
</P>
<P>
   The Alarmist. Directed and written by Evan Dunsky. Cast: David
Arquette, Stanley Tucci, Kate Capshaw, Mary McCormack, Ryan
Reynolds. Lions Gate Films. 95 minutes. Rated R for violence and
sexual references.

   Grade: D

`LIVING' TOUCHING, BUT TALKY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Can a woman betrayed and divorced find happiness in
her 40s? She might if she goes to see ``Living Out Loud,'' a
bittersweet comedy that suggests that the best revenge is laughing
at the bums.
</P>
<P>
   Holly Hunter stars as Judith Nelson, good wife to a successful
New York doctor, who discovers after 16 years of marriage that her
husband is cheating on her.
</P>
<P>
   After the divorce, Judith tries to find out where she left her
life and how she can restart it.
</P>
<P>
   Under the magnetic principle that one lonely person always
attracts another lonely person, Judith befriends her
apartment-house doorman (Danny DeVito), also divorced with money
woes, an ailing daughter and a need to make someone happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living Out Loud'' is a bitterly comic look at people stuck in
lives they don't want, thinking there has to be something else for
them.
</P>
<P>
   The laughter through the tears comes from Richard LaGravenese,
the writer who played similar heartstrings of
aging-but-still-in-love-with-love types in ``The Horse Whisperer''
and ``Bridges of Madison County,'' as he steps behind the camera to
direct his first film.
</P>
<P>
   As a director, he's a terrific writer. The film is full of
sparkling dialogue, barbed speeches and sharp one-liners.
</P>
<P>
   The movie works best when LaGravenese pictures Judith's
fantasies, which are aided by alcohol, drugs and sexual yearning.
But the movie's strength leads to its weakness, as ``Living Out
Loud'' has far too much chatter.
</P>
<P>
   As a director, LaGravenese is in dire need of something to move
his story along. It goes round and round a tight little track until
it wears a rut in our affections for Judith and her plight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living Out Loud'' plays like a collection of anecdotes,
fantasies and witticisms that dissects the pains of modern romance.
But the moments don't add up to a great movie, despite Hunter's
angry performance.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, last seen in ``A Life Less Ordinary,'' is a marvelous
actress, daring and unpredictable, which gives ``Living Out Loud''
its primary tension.
</P>
<P>
   DeVito, who also produced the movie, seems comfortable playing
outside comedy as a small man with smallish dreams of happiness.
</P>
<P>
   The movie also remakes Queen Latifah from the rapping bank
robber of ``Set It Off'' to a jazz crooner wise in the ways of
love.
</P>
<P>
   At times, ``Living Out Loud'' seems aimed exclusively at 40-ish
women who have been dumped by wealthy husbands for younger wives.
But maybe it will reach out and touch other people, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living Out Loud'' is rated R for profanity, nudity and sex. 3
stars. &QL;

`THE WATERBOY' IS GOOFILY ENJOYABLE _ AND BRIEF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adam Sandler skates by on a thin, one-note premise in ``The
Waterboy,'' which he also co-wrote with his old NYU college buddy,
Tim Herlihy. Fortunately, it's a mostly painless, goofily enjoyable
comedy that speeds along for its brief, 86-minute running time.
</P>
<P>
   It's also to Sandler's credit that he's cast the supporting
roles surprisingly well _ and with such big names as Oscar-winner
Kathy Bates, who plays his backwoods bayou mama. But Bates, Fairuza
Balk and Henry Winkler still are given relatively little to do
against the likable character that Sandler has created for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Boucher (Sandler) is a sweet, naive 31-year-old. He's been
home-schooled by his fiercely protective Mama (Bates) and the only
job he's ever held is as water boy (or ``water distribution
engineer'' as Bobby calls it) for a Louisiana college football team
whose players mercilessly abuse and torment the inept fellow.
Bobby, humiliated, forges on because he knows everything about
water and he toils laboriously to make sure the team is satiated
with the perfect blend of pure, chemical-free H2O.
</P>
<P>
   After being fired from the top team, Bobby has to take a job for
a school whose athletic department is run by Coach Klein (Winkler),
a worn-out, third-rate guy whose team has lost 40 games in a row..
One day Klein encourages Bobby to unleash his pent-up rage and
Bobby turns from a mouse into the most deadly, domineering tackle
on earth.
</P>
<P>
   Now all Bobby has to do is make sure his mama doesn't find out
he's playing ball, going to school _ and seeing a tough-talking
tomboy named Vicki Vallencourt (Balk), because Mama always said
that sports, women, college, electricity and even Ben Franklin are
products ``of the devil.''
</P>
<P>
   It's pretty easy to see where ``The Waterboy'' will wind up from
its opening frame. But Sandler and his cast appear to have a blast
together.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a film that's better than Sandler's hit, ``The
Wedding Singer,'' which seemed to drag on endlessly. Though the
formula is predictable, Sandler has obviously learned to tell his
tale without too many frills and distractions. The result is
good-natured silliness that quenches the comedic gratification pang
but is totally forgotten a minute after leaving the theater.
</P>
<P>
   The Waterboy. Directed by Frank Coraci. Written by Adam Sandler,
Tim Herlihy. Cast: Sandler, Kathy Bates, Fairuza Balk, Henry
Winkler. Touchstone Pictures. 86 minutes. Rated PG-13 for language.

`DOLLHOUSE' PREVIEWED DIRECTOR'S WEIRD WAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MELISSA MORRISON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Todd Solondz is a freak. He must be.
</P>
<P>
   Touched by the magic wand of Sundance for his first feature,
1996's ``Welcome to the Dollhouse,'' he had a free limousine ride
to Hollywood, where, for his next movie, he could have had studio
bucks, A-list actors, his own personal trainer, and, no doubt, a
beautiful starlet draped around his nerdish, four-eyed self.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he stayed back East and made a movie about a pedophile,
an obscene phone-caller and assorted other misfits. He passed over
stars to cast lesser-knowns. And he actively sought what amounts to
an NC-17 rating, the commercial equivalent of stamping a milk
carton with last week's sell-by date.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of American filmmaker would make such choices? A
freak. But a talented freak.
</P>
<P>
   Solondz's follow-up is ``Happiness,'' about the relationships
and near-misses among a group of loosely connected New Jersey-ites,
most of whom are people you wouldn't glance twice at in an elevator
(but better hope it doesn't get stuck between floors). The movie
won the acclaim of critics at Cannes and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have this great fortune of the kind of success of
`Dollhouse,' you want to take advantage of it,'' says Solondz, 39,
on the phone from New York. He has a voice like The Nanny, if she
grew up soft-spoken in New Jersey. ``The best way is to create some
script or project that would be impossible to get financing for if
you didn't have that success behind you. . . . You never know if
you'll be able to take advantage of it again.''
</P>
<P>
   He almost didn't. October Films, which is owned by Universal
Pictures, gave Solondz $2.5 million to make ``Happiness.'' But when
the CEO of Universal Studios saw the result, he forbade the film's
distribution. Another production company, Good Machine Releasing,
eventually took over.
</P>
<P>
   Solondz, who studied English at Yale, grew up wanting to be a
pianist. He says his parents forbade him from seeing anything but
G-rated films (``Chitty Chitty Bang Bang'' and Jerry Lewis were as
sophisticated as it got for me''). So when he got to college,
``because I had no social life,'' he saw everything, from Ingmar
Bergman to the Marx Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   He went to film school at New York University and eventually
made ``Welcome to the Dollhouse,'' which got the kind of critical
reception and box-office receipts aspiring filmmakers trade kidneys
for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happiness'' shares themes with ``Dollhouse,'' but on a much
more ambitious scale. ``Dollhouse'' was the story of Dawn Wiener, a
junior-high loser taunted by her classmates (``Wiener Dog!'') and
desperate to be popular. In most filmmakers' versions of the
adolescent underdog, Dawn would be nerdy-but-cute and eventually
triumph over her classmates' cruelty through some act of heroism.
</P>
<P>
   In Solondz's version, Dawn has an overbite that braces never
will correct, and acts as viciously to the few castes that remain
beneath her as the other kids do to her. Through her neglect, she
even contributes to her sister's kidnapping by a local pervert,
although no harm is done.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Happiness,'' though, harm is done. Bill Maplewood, a
married psychiatrist with three kids and a big house in the
suburbs, has earnest heart-to-hearts about sex with his 11-year-old
son, but eventually molests the kid's playmate during a sleepover.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes it tragic is he's in fact a great father that loves
his wife and son,'' Solondz says. ``He's not a monster, but he
struggles with a monster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no interest in pedophilia per se, I did no research on
the subject. . . . But for me these are ways of getting at themes
that most compel me, which are those of loneliness and desire and
isolation and alienation and that struggle to connect to a kind of
intimacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Reportedly, October Films pressured Solondz to cast a well-known
actor like Bill Pullman in the part of Maplewood. Instead, he chose
Dylan Baker, who till then had played supporting roles in movies
such as ``Disclosure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want a name actor for that role,'' Solondz says. ``I
wanted someone who would seem like a regular sort of person.''
</P>
<P>
   Solondz says that the part most sought by stars was the film's
dumpy office grub who makes sputtering obscene phone calls. ``They
would fly out from LA to meet and read for me, and say, `This is
me, this is my life,' '' he says. (Instead, Solondz cast Philip
Seymour Hoffman.)
</P>
<P>
   While other directors upgrade their sport utility vehicle for
their film's premiere, Solondz got an unlisted number. It was his
one concession to any uproar the film might prompt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people will start pacing with rosaries,'' he
says. ``It hasn't happened so far. But I don't see the point of
worrying about something I have no control over. The movie isn't
designed for everyone. It shouldn't be expected everyone would go
see it or like it.'' &QL;

`THE EEL' SHOWS HOW EASILY DORMANT PASSION CAN SPIN OUT OF
CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Japanese actor Koji Yakusho has made an art out of playing a
middle-aged corporate drone. In ``Shall We Dance,'' he was a
white-collar computer worker who took dancing lessons to put some
excitement in his life.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Eel,'' Shohei Imamura's 1997 film that won the Palme
d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, Yakusho again dons a blue suit _
but not for long. The suit almost immediately gives way to a
prisoner's drab green and then changes again to the sterling white
of a barber's smock.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Eel'' is a tricky film about dormant passion and how
easily it can spin out of control. After receiving a mysterious
letter, Takuro (Yakusho), learns of his beautiful wife's
infidelity. He sneaks home early from a fishing trip and catches
her making noisy, wild love with another man. In a rage, he
savagely stabs her to death and then, just as suddenly, compacts
all his untapped emotions back in check. He neatly covers her body
and bicycles to the police station, where he quietly turns himself
in.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years pass and Takuro is paroled. He takes his pet eel
with him. When asked, ``Why an eel?'' he responds, ``He listens to
what I say.'' Takuro's parole officer, who is also a Buddhist
priest, helps him begin life anew as a barber in a small fishing
community.
</P>
<P>
   But it isn't easy. With just his pet and an eccentric group of
oddball friends, Takuro stays contained and pent up in his safe,
quiet world. Though he's disturbed by nightmares of his wife and
brutal nocturnal memories of her grisly demise, he insists he's
``through with women.''
</P>
<P>
   One day he finds an unconscious Keiko (Misa Shimizu) lying near
the water. She's tried to commit suicide and he's instantly struck
by her more than fleeting resemblance to his wife. She recovers and
comes by to thank him. And she stays at the shop, cleaning and
cooking and creating life and beauty around Takuro.
</P>
<P>
   But he resists her influence, opting to stay apart from the
emotions she makes him feel. Her checkered past reappears, just as
Takuro's bad dreams continue. The two must find a way to heal and
to forgive themselves for the mistakes they've made.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Eel'' is a marvelous film about reconciliation and
self-preservation. Its humanist message is wrapped with absurd,
almost farcical events that give it an odd, screwball feel. But
it's really a dark work about the desire to re-connect with people
and life after being cut off from everyone and everything.
</P>
<P>
   In a lovely passage, Takuro takes his eel out on a trawl. Under
the evening's full moon he marvels over his pet's ability to swim
hundreds of miles to care for its young, facing certain death in
the process. At that moment, Takuro recognizes the capacity for
life itself and how, in its unpredictability, nature is full of
wonder and beauty. The film is made up of many moments like this.
</P>
<P>
   The Eel. Directed and written by Shohei Imamura. Cast: Koji
Yakusho, Misa Shimizu, Fujio Tsuneta. New Yorker Films. 117
minutes. Unrated with graphic violence, sexual content, nudity. In

RAPE, SUICIDE, PEDOPHILIA: THESE LEAD TO `HAPPINESS'? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MELISSA MORRISON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - ``Happiness'' begins with a break-up scene in a
restaurant. The dumpee is played by Jon Lovitz, and one expects the
mackerel-lipped comedian to burst into ``Saturday Night Live''
shenanigans. Instead, his face quivers, his eyes well up, and his
heart shatters like a windshield before he makes a bitter recovery.
The scene is exquisitely painful to watch. And funny.
</P>
<P>
   But it has nothing on what follows. ``Happiness,'' the second
film by past Sundance prince Todd Solondz (``Welcome to the
Dollhouse''), features a grisly murder (off screen), a mass-murder
fantasy (on screen), suicide, rape, obscene phone calls,
masturbation and, most notoriously, pedophilia.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, not everyone will find this funny. But like a
twisted wizard, Solondz spins comedy out of the black, rotting
heart of human relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Other auteur filmmakers get credit for portrayals of domestic
life that dare to deviate from the movie mainstream's conception of
people with good hair breaking up and making up amid ``House &AMP;
Garden'' splendor.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Allen's husbands and wives have their neuroses and
philandering, but by the final scene, they've recoupled and been
restored to relative harmony. And the troubled families of Paul
Thomas Anderson (``Boogie Nights'') and Tamara Jenkins (``Slums of
Beverly Hills''), despite their lovable, sometimes-appalling
behavior, stay together in the end. The audience leaves in a good
mood but sometimes with the tinny suspicion that the filmmaker
sacrificed honest follow-through to end on an up note.
</P>
<P>
   Solondz not only takes on the more disturbing aspects of human
relations, he plumbs them like Roto-Rooter.
</P>
<P>
   His world centers on three New Jersey sisters and their
families. A by-all-appearances upstanding father (Dylan Baker) with
a perky wife, good PTA attendance and a chintz-covered living room
has fantasies of blowing away his fellow citizens with an automatic
weapon and eventually rapes his 11-year-old son's playmate.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who has ever read yet another headline about
molestation charges against a Boy Scout leader or teacher and
wondered, ``Who (begin ital) are (end ital) these people?'' here's
one filmmaker's answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happiness'' was dropped by its original distributor because of
the pedophilia (which happens off screen) and other graphic subject
matter but was eventually rescued for distribution by another
company. However, the scenes that really pierce are those that show
its characters' attempts _ usually failed _ to make connections
with each other.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Neil Labute's ``Your Friends and Neighbors,'' another
misanthropic comedy, ``Happiness'' manages to remain absorbing as
characters commit or endure one repugnant act after another.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are a smut-minded apartment dweller (Philip Seymour
Hoffman, who played another compelling loser in ``Boogie Nights'')
and his fat, lovelorn neighbor (Camryn Manheim of TV's ``The
Practice'').
</P>
<P>
   There's Joy (Jane Adams), a wispy, guitar-strumming optimist _
and the closest thing the movie has to a sympathetic character _
who endures such a series of humiliations that the audience
develops a Pavlovian dread on her behalf every time she appears.
</P>
<P>
   Most harrowing, there's Dr. Maplewood (Baker), whose
facts-of-life chats with his young son (Rufus Read) begin as a kind
of sly ``Father Knows Best'' parody and end with a stunning and
deeply bitter exchange. That scene is shocking, and Solondz pulls
it off because it doesn't have a false moment.
</P>
<P>
   The film's comedy is of the laugh-otherwise-cry variety. But
much of it comes from spattering battery acid on the bland domestic
front under which all of this desperation and loneliness are
conveyed.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman's character spews out a pornographic fantasy to his
therapist, who picks lint off his trousers and goes over his
grocery list. The soundtrack is studded with hits by Air Supply and
Barry Manilow. The burps and tweets of an electronic TV game
provide the backdrop as Maplewood homes in on his child prey.
</P>
<P>
   The cast is rich with fine performances from actors who aren't
quite household names but are familiar from their checkered
resumes, including Cynthia Stevenson (``The Player''); Jared Harris
(``I Shot Andy Warhol''); Lara Flynn Boyle (``Afterglow''); Louise
Lasser (TV's ``Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman''); and Cassavetes ve
teran Ben Gazzara.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, amid such a herd, Solondz's stunt casting of a
famous divorcee in a minor role is jarring. And Boyle's glamorous
poet, though a brittle and funny performance, seems to belong to a
different movie, one that stabs West Coast artistes rather than
East Coast suburbanites.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just so trying to be admired all the time,'' she sighs.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie's biggest flaw is that, at 2 1/4 hours, this
carnival of horrors becomes numbing. The length diminishes somewhat
the movie's straight-no-chaser style _ but only somewhat.
Otherwise, ``Happiness'' is harsh, clarifying stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happiness'' is not rated, but no one younger than 18 will be
admitted. Aside from the previously mentioned elements, the movie
features some nudity and sex, graphic language and a host of other
offenses that guarantee it won't be showing up on the Disney
Channel. 4 stars. &QL;

JEFFERSON AND HEMINGS: SCIENCE BACKS A FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KIMBERLY A.C. WILSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISSAQUAH, Wash. _ Five-year-old Rebecca Westerinen believed the
family oral history she learned from her grandmother, Julia, long
before genetic test results linked her father to President Thomas
Jefferson and a slave known as ``Dusky'' Sally.
</P>
<P>
   Oft-told family legend holds that Thomas Jefferson and Sally
Hemings begot Eston, who begot Beverly, who bore Carl, who begot
William, who begot Julia, who in turn bore William, young Rebecca's
dad.
</P>
<P>
   A finding published this week in the scientific journal Nature
concludes it is ``unlikely'' that anyone other than Jefferson
fathered Eston Hemings Jefferson _ old news to the precocious
youngster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy's got the nose,'' Rebecca said as she pointed a finger
at Jeff Westerinen's prominent and vaguely familiar proboscis.
</P>
<P>
   What she and the rest of the Westerinen family also have is
confirmation of a melting pot heritage that includes one of
America's greatest statesmen and a slave whose grandmother was born
in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can be proud of the richness, proud of Jefferson and proud
that we've got some black heritage as well,'' said Microsoft
program manager Jeff (nee William Jefferson) Westerinen. ``I know
it sounds like a cliche, but it's a very American story.''
</P>
<P>
   However, despite the study's findings, the Jefferson-Hemings
liaison continues to draw skepticism from some of the president's
undisputed kin. Herbert Barger, a Jefferson descendant by marriage
who lives in Maryland, refuses to believe the Virginia plantation
owner who penned the Declaration of Independence would have
consorted with a woman he owned as a slave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say, right out loud, that maybe a Jefferson, but not Thomas,
is the father,'' said Barger, whose wife, Evelyn, is Jefferson's
first cousin, six generations removed. ``As long as he had a
brother and six nephews living down the road, you can't close the
book on Thomas Jefferson being the one.''
</P>
<P>
   The study in the Nov. 5 issue of Nature appears to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   Retired University of Virginia pathologist Eugene Foster
gathered blood samples from 18 Jefferson family descendants and
coordinated the yearlong research in the hope of using science to
solve a mystery rooted in circumstantial evidence, oral history and
physical resemblance.
</P>
<P>
   Foster compared Y chromosomes, which are only found in males, in
the DNA from male-line descendants of the president's paternal
uncle, from Hemings' eldest and youngest sons, and from male
descendants of one of Jefferson's sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Foster found genetic evidence that Thomas Woodson, Hemings'
eldest son, was not fathered by Jefferson. He also determined that
it was a hundred times more likely that Eston, Hemings' youngest
son, was fathered by Thomas Jefferson than by someone outside the
Jefferson clan.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, while not conclusive proof, resonate with the
stories Jeff Westerinen learned from relatives about the man he has
long considered his great-great-great-great-great-grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives recounted tales of life inside Jefferson's Monticello
estate: how Madison Hemings looked enough like the tall, pale,
red-haired president to startle guests when he served them dinner.
And of the pact the lovers are said to have made to grant Hemings'
children their freedom when they turned 21.
</P>
<P>
   More than once, Jeff Westerinen heard about the privileged
treatment, including schooling and violin lessons, that Hemings and
her children received in an era when the education of a slave was a
criminal offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother was very careful to point out that it was a loving
relationship,'' Westerinen said. ``I think he was a man of
brilliance and a man with frailties.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also a man of contradictions. Jefferson showed a puzzling
ambivalence toward slavery, making repeated but futile attempts to
outlaw it in public life, while resisting granting freedom to his
own slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Adds Westerinen's wife, Andrea: ``I don't know what it hurts
that Jefferson loved Sally Hemings. It certainly makes the case for
him being a human even before his time.''

ELEPHANT'S HEALTH PLAN HAS A PRICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - There is no tougher day on a newspaper hack than the
first Wednesday in November.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the polls close Tuesday, the political reptiles
who've been basking for months in constant media sunlight slither
back under their rocks, forcing scribblers like me to seek out
higher life forms.
</P>
<P>
   Which is what I tried to do.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, a press secretary for Ruby the Asian elephant
told me Wednesday morning that her client was ``in seclusion'' and
``unavailable to the public or the press.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally, a reporter wouldn't put much stock in the word of a PR
flak. In this case, however, the health problems of Ruby the Asian
elephant have been well documented, even appearing on the front
pages of local papers the morning of the big election.
</P>
<P>
   The calf Ruby's been carrying for nearly two years died inside
her and must be removed. The operation is tricky. She may not
survive.
</P>
<P>
   A team of medical experts from all over America is being
assembled at the Phoenix Zoo in preparation for the big operation. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Health care trade-offs &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Businesses and organizations ranging from Upjohn pharmaceuticals
to Discount Tires have donated materials to assist in the
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   (Tires are needed, apparently, to aid in the comfort of a
reclining 9,000-pound pachyderm.)
</P>
<P>
   In essence, Ruby the Asian elephant has a better health care
plan than 99 percent of Americans. Not that there haven't been
trade-offs.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I wanted to see her.
</P>
<P>
   The way I figure it, any thinking creature in Ruby's position
would use some of the time before surgery to reflect on life's
choices, or lack of them.
</P>
<P>
   She was born in Thailand, where freedom has its dangers. An
elephant there has a good chance of being killed by a poacher or
forced into hard labor. Elephants do the heavy work in local
logging operations, which also destroy their natural habitat.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, Ruby has her own barn and three square meals a day.
</P>
<P>
   She's got a lovely human name.
</P>
<P>
   She's even had a career in art, using her trunk to hold brushes
and then having her creations sold for thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of career track is unattainable for the less
artistically inclined Asian elephants currently lumbering through
the Thai woods.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do any of those elephants have humans in a major
metropolitan area conducting prayer vigils on their behalf, as Ruby
does. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Humans love Ruby &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A company called Sleep America, which sells mattresses, is
joining with the tire company to provide Ruby with a soft spot to
lie down.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of (begin ital) humans (end ital) don't have that.
</P>
<P>
   According to zoo officials, surgery won't occur before Friday.
In the meantime, donations and good wishes continue to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response has been overwhelming,'' I was told. ``Ruby is
very much loved.''
</P>
<P>
   That's true. Humans love her.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to other elephants, though, Ruby didn't get to
select a bridegroom of her liking, as she might have in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she was packed off to Oklahoma and forced to associate
with a husky fellow she'd never met so they could . . . you know.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure there's a human female on Earth who'd accept free
health care in exchange for two years of romantic interludes with a
Tulsa ruffian named Sneezy.
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of question Ruby might ask (begin ital) us. (end
ital)
</P>
<P>
   She also might wonder if there are many humans who'd volunteer
to trade their freedom for three square meals a day and a bed.
</P>
<P>
   I called Florence to find out.
</P>
<P>
   As of the moment I filed this dispatch, no line of hopeful
lodgers had formed outside the state prison. &QL;

`LIVING OUT LOUD' DOESN'T QUITE ACHIEVE ITS LOFTY GOALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Writer and first-time director Richard LaGravenese says ``Living
Out Loud,'' is based upon two stories by Anton Chekhov.
</P>
<P>
   And though his characters are drowning with Chekhovian
tragi-comic appeal and often act buffoonish and inappropriate when
placed in delicate situations, the film is nearer to Paul
Mazursky's 1977 epistle about a wife finding herself, ``An
Unmarried Woman,'' than to the Russian dramatist.
</P>
<P>
   It's an interesting idea to take dated _ if timeless _ ideals
and project them into a big, urgent, rushing city like Manhattan.
It's even more risky to show a character's vulnerability, inner
fantasies and wishes, performing them like numbers from a musical
or theatrical play, and then inter-cut them into life.
</P>
<P>
   But does it pan out? Give LaGravenese a pat on the back for his
lofty goal, but sorry, ``Living Out Loud'' feels oddly out of sync
and overwhelmed by its eccentricities.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that could easily be attributed to the casting. Holly
Hunter plays Judith, a 40-ish doctor's wife who learns her
cardiologist husband (Martin Donovan) is leaving her for a younger
woman. Judith hibernates in their tony Fifth Avenue co-op, drinking
too much and ruminating over what could have been. She ultimately
acknowledges, ``I don't know where I've been for the last 20 years.
I don't know who he left.''
</P>
<P>
   Her only solace is trekking downtown to Jaspar's, a nightclub
where she sips martinis and listens to the soulful songs of torch
singer Liz Bailey (Queen Latifah), who befriends Judith after she
gets drunk and heckles an ``amateur night'' participant.
</P>
<P>
   One night Judith engages Pat (Danny DeVito), the elevator man in
her building, in conversation. She learns his daughter has just
died from cancer and his wife booted him out because he gambled
himself into serious debt trying to earn enough money to please
her. The two lost souls become friends, and in a struggle to find
out who they are, learn timing is everything and, sometimes, love
alone just isn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   LaGravenese, who has a pretty decent track record writing films
that are rich with adult themes _ ``The Horse Whisperer,'' ``The
Fisher King'' and ``Beloved'' among them _ got his start in the
theater. ``Living Out Loud'' is rife with theatricality.
</P>
<P>
   Who in the world hasn't been in an awkward situation and at a
loss for words, only to later conjure up a million snappy retorts?
``Living Out Loud'' has the opposite problem. It's too full of
cleverness. It's laced with biting, zingy wit and implausible
dialogue that really only works onstage. Judith responds
brilliantly to every occasion and she's so vibrant, it's a wonder
her husband would ever leave such an exciting wife.
</P>
<P>
   While Hunter is certainly an acquired taste, she's makes full
use of her deft timing and oddball scrappiness. She manages to make
us feel her agonizing pain yet maintains a unique individuality.
DeVito is equally good. He's believeable as a man who just wants to
give love and his heartbreaking confession later in the film rings
intimately and uncomfortably true.
</P>
<P>
   But LaGravenese as a director can't keep up with his actors. He
zig-zags back and forth between reality, fantasy, tone and time,
and in the end, ``Living Out Loud'' becomes a mess of tics and
quirks. It might be entertaining and even moving fun at times, but,
alas, it's still a mess.

   PHOENIX - There is no tougher day on a newspaper hack than the
first Wednesday in November.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the polls close Tuesday, the political reptiles
who've been basking for months in constant media sunlight slither
back under their rocks, forcing scribblers like me to seek out
higher life forms.
</P>
<P>
   Which is what I tried to do.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, a press secretary for Ruby the Asian elephant
told me Wednesday morning that her client was ``in seclusion'' and
``unavailable to the public or the press.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally, a reporter wouldn't put much stock in the word of a PR
flak. In this case, however, the health problems of Ruby the Asian
elephant have been well documented, even appearing on the front
pages of local papers the morning of the big election.
</P>
<P>
   The calf Ruby's been carrying for nearly two years died inside
her and must be removed. The operation is tricky. She may not
survive.
</P>
<P>
   A team of medical experts from all over America is being
assembled at the Phoenix Zoo in preparation for the big operation. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Health care trade-offs &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Businesses and organizations ranging from Upjohn pharmaceuticals
to Discount Tires have donated materials to assist in the
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   (Tires are needed, apparently, to aid in the comfort of a
reclining 9,000-pound pachyderm.)
</P>
<P>
   In essence, Ruby the Asian elephant has a better health care
plan than 99 percent of Americans. Not that there haven't been
trade-offs.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I wanted to see her.
</P>
<P>
   The way I figure it, any thinking creature in Ruby's position
would use some of the time before surgery to reflect on life's
choices, or lack of them.
</P>
<P>
   She was born in Thailand, where freedom has its dangers. An
elephant there has a good chance of being killed by a poacher or
forced into hard labor. Elephants do the heavy work in local
logging operations, which also destroy their natural habitat.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, Ruby has her own barn and three square meals a day.
</P>
<P>
   She's got a lovely human name.
</P>
<P>
   She's even had a career in art, using her trunk to hold brushes
and then having her creations sold for thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of career track is unattainable for the less
artistically inclined Asian elephants currently lumbering through
the Thai woods.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do any of those elephants have humans in a major
metropolitan area conducting prayer vigils on their behalf, as Ruby
does. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Humans love Ruby &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A company called Sleep America, which sells mattresses, is
joining with the tire company to provide Ruby with a soft spot to
lie down.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of (begin ital) humans (end ital) don't have that.
</P>
<P>
   According to zoo officials, surgery won't occur before Friday.
In the meantime, donations and good wishes continue to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The response has been overwhelming,'' I was told. ``Ruby is
very much loved.''
</P>
<P>
   That's true. Humans love her.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to other elephants, though, Ruby didn't get to
select a bridegroom of her liking, as she might have in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she was packed off to Oklahoma and forced to associate
with a husky fellow she'd never met so they could . . . you know.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure there's a human female on Earth who'd accept free
health care in exchange for two years of romantic interludes with a
Tulsa ruffian named Sneezy.
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of question Ruby might ask (begin ital) us. (end
ital)
</P>
<P>
   She also might wonder if there are many humans who'd volunteer
to trade their freedom for three square meals a day and a bed.
</P>
<P>
   I called Florence to find out.
</P>
<P>
   As of the moment I filed this dispatch, no line of hopeful
lodgers had formed outside the state prison. &QL;

WE'RE ALL HEIRS OF JEFFERSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER DOKES  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Thomas Jefferson's sexual relationship with his slave
probably was as complicated as the days in which he lived, as
conflicted as the man himself.
</P>
<P>
   The nation inherited this Founding Father's self-contradictions
and hypocrisies on matters of race and equality. We are his people
indeed.
</P>
<P>
   The revelations about Jefferson and Sally Hemings having at
least one child together explain why the topic of race relations
makes fools and liars of us to this day.
</P>
<P>
   His life reflects our heritage of slavery and freedom, and all
their derivatives _ Jim Crow and ``equal protection,'' poll taxes
and the Voting Rights Act, discrimination and equal opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Bring Jefferson's story forward for a better understanding of
why a mom would fight Huckleberry Finn.
</P>
<P>
   Freedom rings hollow when your child comes home hurting from
lessons taught in a public school. (begin ital) That's (end ital)
why Kathy Monteiro sued the Tempe Unified School District. Not to
ban a book, but to protect her daughter from the racism embodied in
the word ``nigger.''
</P>
<P>
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Monteiro's bid to
remove ``Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' from a mandatory reading
list because of the offensive word. But it cautioned against
dismissing her concerns outright.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not take an educational psychologist,'' the court
said, ``to conclude that being referred to by one's peers by the
most noxious racial epithet in the contemporary American lexicon,
being shamed and humiliated on the basis of one's race, and having
the school authorities ignore or reject one's complaints would
adversely affect a Black child's ability to obtain the same benefit
from schooling as her White counterparts.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson's descendants know of that shame and humiliation.
Monteiro fought for the freedom their ancestor denied his flesh and
blood.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, yes, yes. Times were different then. Context and
perspective are essential to any discussion about race whether it's
circa 1998 or 1798.
</P>
<P>
   Some historians were absolute in their belief that Jefferson was
too good a man to father children outside of marriage and by a
slave no less. But the possibility was never that remote.
Slaveholders often made sexual use of their property.
</P>
<P>
   It may very well be that what Jefferson did with Hemings in
Monticello was different from the rapes committed by fellow gentry
in the slave quarters. The results were the same, however. The
liaisons produced children born into slavery.
</P>
<P>
   There is no scientific test that identifies with the certainty
of DNA markers the truth that lies in the hearts of men. Even if
there were, we still might not know what made Jefferson tick.
</P>
<P>
   The man who penned principles of freedom and equality for a new
nation was also a man who turned away from his abolitionist
leanings to criticize emancipation and to reject mixing of the
races. This transformation, if that's what it was, occurred at the
same time he was having sex with a mulatto, who by most reports was
young, stunningly beautiful and intelligent.
</P>
<P>
   The Jefferson story should help Blacks and Whites look more
carefully at shared roots that have created muddy dichotomies. It
should be easier now to ask, ``Do we really know what we see?''
</P>
<P>
   When a White preschool boy pronounces to a brown-eyed girl, ``No
Black people in block center,'' is this baby racism or is it simply
a little boy's way of reserving room for his friends?
</P>
<P>
   When we witness efforts to kill a program by the city of Phoenix
to address a substantiated pattern of discrimination in awarding
contracts, is this the typical swing of the equality pendulum or is
this grown-up talk for ``No Black people in block center''?
</P>
<P>
   We fairly worship the Founding Fathers' high ideals, but we also
can be backsliders, retreating from their goals and selectively
interpreting them.
</P>
<P>
   The Jefferson story helps us understand why. We were born that
way. It's in the genes. &QL;

STRUGGLE TO REBUILD PULLS A REFUGEE HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RON REDMOND  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ Former Cambodian refugee Ou Bun Long left
the comfort and security of Seattle in 1992 to join a massive
international effort aimed at rebuilding his war-ravaged homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Six years, two troubled elections and more than $3 billion
later, Cambodians and international aid workers still struggle in
this impoverished and politically divided nation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to recent political turmoil that has left it
paralyzed and internationally isolated, the country of 11 million
people has been hit by drought, pestilence, increasing food
shortages and rising crime, including robberies and kidnappings of
foreigners. Tourism barely exists. Prostitution runs rampant, along
with AIDS. As many as 6 million land mines litter the countryside,
and warlords rule many areas. In the north and northwest, the last
remnants of the communist Khmer Rouge _ whose 1975-79 reign of
terror killed as many as 2 million people _ continue to mount
small-scale guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Cambodia, by all accounts, is the basket case of Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Ou spent 11 years in Seattle, much of it as a refugee social
worker with the Asian Counseling and Referral Service. He was one
of thousands of Cambodians who immigrated to the Puget Sound region
but maintained close links with their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   With at least 25,000 to 30,000 Cambodian immigrants, Washington
state has one of the largest Cambodian American communities in the
United States. Ou, using the education and experience he gained in
the United States, has trained Cambodians in social work, human
rights and democracy since his return.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few years, however, he came to the conclusion that
no one was really listening, and that the only way to bring change
to Cambodia was through political power _ forcing reform from the
top down. So he joined a political party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked about democracy, human rights and helping others for
six years, but nobody was really applying these principles,'' said
Ou, now a senior official in the opposition Sam Rainsy Party. ``So
I decided I needed some power of my own in order to actually apply
the principles I've been preaching for the past six years.''
</P>
<P>
   That somewhat authoritarian approach to democracy may indeed be
a prerequisite for change here, but it underscores the polarization
that has contributed to Cambodia's seemingly endless downward
spiral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody talks about democracy and the popular will, but
everybody means something different by it,'' says Chea Vannath,
president of the Center for Social Development in Phnom Penh. ``If
you have three Cambodians, you have three single-minded solutions,
and no one is willing to compromise. They all want their own way.''
</P>
<P>
   That lack of cooperation is evident in the current political
stalemate that has paralyzed the country. The government of
strongman Hun Sen has been denied international recognition despite
its self-declared victory in July 26 parliamentary elections that
the opposition says were marked by fraud and intimidation. Hun
Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party, or CPP, won 64 of 122 seats
but failed to garner the two-thirds majority needed to form a
government on its own.
</P>
<P>
   The two opposition groups _ Prince Norodom Ranariddh's Funcinpec
Party and the Sam Rainsy Party _ have allied and refuse to join the
CPP in a coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Charges of vote fraud brought thousands of demonstrators into
the streets in late August and early September, sparking a
government crackdown that left scores of people missing or dead and
eventually sent many opposition members into exile.
</P>
<P>
   The stalemate has worsened an already desperate situation.
Cambodia's U.N. seat was declared vacant after a bloody coup last
year. Most foreign aid donors have delayed new programs or
suspended assistance altogether, pending completion of the July
elections and establishment of a credible coalition government.
Foreign aid is critical for Cambodia, providing an estimated 50
percent of its national budget in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Although there have been some reverberations from Asia's
yearlong financial crisis, most Cambodians are so far removed from
the economic mainstream that the regional turmoil has had no impact
on their impoverished lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy here is so unintegrated that there was hardly any
affect at all,'' said Jeff Hodson, deputy editor of The Phnom Penh
Daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cambodia's future looks very bleak politically,'' said Kao Kim
Hourn, another former U.S. refugee who is now executive director of
the Cambodian Institute for Cooperation and Peace, a Phnom Penh
think tank. ``If the political situation is not settled, the
economic and security situation won't improve either.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the opposition may have legitimate complaints about the
electoral process, many diplomats and analysts urge the two sides
to compromise and form a government as soon as possible. And while
international observers may have too hastily declared the July
elections free and fair, most believe that addressing opposition
complaints would not substantially change the overall poll results.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes two to tango, and right now, each side _ the
opposition and the government _ is equally responsible for the
stalemate,'' Kao said. ``They are not talking to each other; they
are talking past each other. The opposition and the government have
got to consider the well-being of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   But social well-being has never been high on Cambodia's official
agenda. With a per capita income of just $300 a year, corruption
runs rampant. Teachers demand payments from students for passing
grades. Firemen refuse to douse fires without a cash advance.
Medical treatment is denied unless the patient pays first.
Thousands of people on the payrolls of government ministries seldom
show up for work. Hundreds of dirty, malnourished children and
handicapped people beg on the poorly maintained streets of the
capital, where the palatial mansions of the rich tower behind high
walls topped with barbed-wire.
</P>
<P>
   A poll conducted by Chea Vannath's Center for Social Development
found that 98 percent of Cambodians believe it is ``very important
to end corruption'' and the vicious cycle of poverty that it
breeds.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, no one quite knows how to do it. Despite all the aid
and the presence of scores of foreign experts and humanitarian
agencies, social problems overwhelm Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the spread of AIDS, the poor health of the people,
malnutrition, drug trafficking, prostitution, human trafficking,
the logging of our forests and other environmental degradation,''
Chea said. ``But when we raise our concerns about any of these
social issues with the government, they take it personally. . . .
Everything is very, very politicized, and most of the social issues
just go unsolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, the government has a beautiful national plan with
plenty of international experts helping out, but implementation is
another thing,'' she added. ``There is no political will by the
leaders to tackle these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   So what more can an increasingly frustrated international
community do? Chea and other Cambodian activists believe developed
nations must remain committed to democratic change in Cambodia and
increase pressure on the government and politicians to settle their
differences and focus on the country's many problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international community says it doesn't want to interfere
in our affairs _ that it's a domestic issue,'' Chea said. ``That's
very nice, but we can't solve it ourselves. We need help. I'm
afraid the international community is suffering compassion
fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, as Hun Sen and the opposition remain locked in their
power struggle, some Cambodians still see a glimmer of hope for
their country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international investment in our country is not
worthless,'' said Lao Mong Hay, executive director of The Khmer
Institute of Democracy. ``Ninety percent of our voters turned out
for the July elections. In villages all over the country, they
queued up from early morning until midday to cast their ballots.
Peasants, students and others held peaceful demonstrations for
democracy. . . . They are involved in the making of a free nation.
They want freedom from the bottom of their hearts, and some of them
died for it. It is our responsibility to ensure that they are not
forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Ou Bun Long, he says he'll continue his work for the
opposition and for democracy in hopes of eventually landing a
government position, possibly as human rights chief.
</P>
<P>
   Just in case, Ou hangs on to his U.S. passport. If necessary, he
can return to Seattle, where his children live.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a U.S. citizen and I can go to the U.S. Embassy for help
in case anything happens,'' he said. ``I've already talked to them
about it.''

TRAVEL WEBSITES LURE VISITORS, NOT SHOPPERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAWN GILBERTSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - They're the window shoppers of the online world, and
they're giving the Internet travel industry fits.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you're one of them _ a traveler who checks out the online
travel agencies in search of a low fare or hotel bargain but never
clicks the ``Buy now'' button.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have too many lookers and not enough bookers,'' said
Terrell Jones, president of SABRE Interactive, creators of the
travel Web site Travelocity (www.travelocity.com).
</P>
<P>
   The big gap between browsers and buyers was driven home at a
travel industry conference in Phoenix this week.
</P>
<P>
   A survey released at the PhoCusWright Live 98 Conference found
that 80 percent of ``wired'' travelers have looked at online travel
sites but just 18 percent had booked travel online. A wired
traveler is defined as an adult American who has flown once in the
past year and visited a Web site (travel or otherwise) in the past
month.
</P>
<P>
   Jones says the travel industry has the biggest gap among online
retailers and ``that's the reason we're not profitable.''
Travelocity was one of the sponsors of the survey along with the
other major Internet travel players: MSN Expedia, Internet Travel
Network and Preview Travel. PhoCusWright, a Connecticut consulting
firm, also was a sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the top reasons travelers gave for not buying online:
</P>
<P>
   - Unsafe to use credit card (64 percent).
</P>
<P>
   - Have a travel agent (48 percent).
</P>
<P>
   - Afraid of missing best price (36 percent).
</P>
<P>
   - Use corporate travel agency (36 percent).
</P>
<P>
   - Someone else should do the work (35 percent).
</P>
<P>
   - Won't save money (33 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most discouraging for online travel companies, three out
of four non-buyers say they don't have any intention of buying
travel online anytime soon. At those rates, the industry could have
a tough time racking up the $5 billion in sales projected by 2000.
The current total is about $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with these sobering statistics, players in the fledgling
industry spent much of the conference figuring out how to get
travelers to buy the airline ticket or vacation package from them.
It's not a matter of turning dreamers into customers. The study
found that 70 percent of the online lookers bought the trip they
were researching from a travel agent, airline or other source.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the suggestions for the fledgling industry included:
</P>
<P>
   - Ease customer fears about using the credit card on the
Internet. Jones suggested a public relations campaign, in
conjunction with credit card companies, that says using the
Internet is as safe as using the phone. Individual sites also
should continue to promote their security systems on their home
pages. Travelocity promotes its shop safe guarantee with an icon of
a lock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has helped,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   He and others said it's mostly an emotional issue because there
haven't been any security breaches.
</P>
<P>
   One online travel executive says blaming the lack of bookings on
credit card fears is ``a lot of boloney.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is consumers don't see compelling benefits,'' said
Jay Walker, chairman of price &QL; 
line.com.
</P>
<P>
   When they see a benefit, they have no trouble providing a credit
card, he said, pointing to the $15 million in credit card offers
submitted to the site weekly.
</P>
<P>
   - Provide more incentives to book online. Many sites offer bonus
miles or other deals, but more perks are probably needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does boost traffic,'' said Simon Breakwell, group manager
of Expedia, which is part of the Microsoft family. Expedia.com has
been offering a $99 companion fare for a future flight to travelers
who buy tickets on Northwest or Continental.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Whilden, president and chief executive officer of ITN, said
United Airlines' site (www.ual.com) has seen a big jump in business
from its offer of 20,000 frequent flier miles for travelers who
book 10 trips online between September and December.
</P>
<P>
   Preview Travel plans to tailor its perks, with some designed to
lure frequent shoppers off the fence and others designed to reward
frequent buyers.
</P>
<P>
   On the airline side, Delta is reportedly considering making its
lowest fares available only through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   - Let customers put reservations on hold, preferably for more
than 24 hours. ``Instant purchase is scary,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   - Make the sites easier and speedier to use. Travelocity, for
example, will debut ``3 clicks to fly'' this month, down from the
12 clicks it takes to book a ticket now.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the challenges, those in the young industry remain
upbeat. They point to many successes, not the least of which are
the last-minute airfares travel lovers flock to the Internet for
each week. &QL;

EX-SEATTLEITE PUSHES FOR POWER OF THE PRESS IN DANGEROUS WATERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RON REDMOND  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ Publishing a fair and independent
newspaper in one of the world's most politicized and polarized
capitals is often difficult, sometimes dangerous and always
rewarding, according to a former Seattle resident serving as deputy
editor of the tiny but influential Cambodia Daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Cambodia, and they're not used to a free press here,''
said Jeff Hodson, a 36-year-old Whitman College graduate who left
his Chicago-area newspaper job about 18 months ago in search of
``change and humanitarianism.''
</P>
<P>
   He found opportunities for both in Phnom Penh. In the 18 months
that Hodson has worked at The Cambodia Daily, the capital has been
rocked by one major news story after another _ some ignored by the
government-controlled news media. First came a bloody coup in July
1997, followed this year by troubled parliamentary elections,
street demonstrations, a government crackdown on protests, more
charges of political killings and other human rights abuses, and a
continuing political stalemate that has seen many oppositionists
flee the country.
</P>
<P>
   Although the government of strongman Hun Sen may not agree, all
those events were covered as accurately as possible by the Daily's
35-member staff, Hodson said. Objectivity is a rarity in Cambodia,
where most news media answer to the government or to the political
parties that fund them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been accused of a lot of things _ pro-opposition,
pro-government, you name it,'' Hodson said. ``But everybody reads
us. Hun Sen reads us every morning.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cambodia Daily was founded five years ago by old Asia hand
and journalist Bernard Krisher, who remains the publisher. About 15
of its staff are foreign journalists and the rest are Cambodians.
Supported by Japanese and American assistance organizations, as
well as various U.S. and international news media, the Daily has a
masthead that states that the paper is ``dedicated to strengthening
a free press and training journalists.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Training Cambodian journalists is a major part of our work,''
said Hodson, whose father is a University of Washington Medical
School professor. ``We have seminars on various aspects of
journalism just about every day for our Cambodian colleagues. Many
of them have gone on to work for international wire services and
other newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   Although its circulation is only about 3,000, The Cambodia Daily
is required reading for diplomats, senior government officials, aid
workers, business people and any Cambodian who can afford the 1,200
riel (35 cents) cost. Cambodians also duplicate the paper on their
own copy machines, circulating it all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   The newsletter-size paper averages 16 pages Monday through
Saturday. Primarily an English-language publication, it recently
introduced a four-page Khmer language section containing the main
news stories of the day. The Khmer section is compiled by Associate
Editor Pin Sisovann, who last year spent six months at the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer on a journalism fellowship.
</P>
<P>
   A German publisher recently donated a new printing press, giving
the Daily some of the most modern production equipment in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the new machinery, the Daily has a typical cluttered
newsroom with old computers, tiny desks and hot, cramped work
spaces. The pay is low and the hours are long and hard, but it's a
labor of love for most staff members. Foreign staff average about
two years at the paper before resuming their careers elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commitment here is amazing,'' said Hodson, noting that a
recent Cambodia Daily ad in a U.S. industry magazine brought more
than 60 responses from prospective copy editors.
</P>
<P>
   Publishing under the nose of an authoritarian regime does carry
risks.
</P>
<P>
   In early October, government spokesman Khieu Kanharith
threatened to close the Daily over its coverage of a rocket attack
on a ruling party motorcade in the northern town of Siem Reap.
Khieu also warned on Oct. 5 that American and British journalists
could be ordered out of the country because the government could no
longer guarantee their safety.
</P>
<P>
   Khieu's statements drew immediate criticism from U.S. Ambassador
Kenneth Quinn, forcing the spokesman to back off. But the pressure
remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we print is closely scrutinized by editors,''
Hodson said. ``Each story is read at least four times before it is
printed. Every word, every sentence, every paragraph is attributed.
We take great care to make sure we're accurate and fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the many obstacles, The Cambodia Daily continues its
mission to strengthen the news media. And Hodson believes the
government will leave it alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, I think they're happy to have us here,'' he said.
``They can point to us and tell the world that Cambodia has a free
press.''

HIGH-PROTEIN DIET FASHIONABLE AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
 DIET-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MONTY PHAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - From the ``Lose weight fast! Here's how!'' vault, one
of Diet's Greatest Hits apparently is back for a revival.
</P>
<P>
   The high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet isn't new, but it's
trendy. Recently, such books as 1996's ``Protein Power'' by Michael
and Mary Dan Eades and last year's ``Dr. Adkins' New Diet
Revolution'' by Robert Adkins have detailed different versions of
the weight-loss program.
</P>
<P>
   The premise is fairly simple. The high-protein part of the diet
provides the body with the necessary amino acids it needs for
muscle growth. To lose weight, the intake of carbohydrates, which
break down into simple sugars and can lead to fat storage in the
body, is kept low. With less new fat being stored, excess fat then
can be burned off.
</P>
<P>
   But, like any diet, there's a delicate balance, says Dr. Michael
Steingard, a Phoenix orthopedic surgeon who has had bodybuilders
and other athletes as patients. He recommends stressing protein in
one's diet, but warns there are drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   A main concern is a condition called azotemia, caused by excess
protein, and, as a result, excess nitrogen. The body's renal
tubules become unable to handle the excess nitrogen, causing a
buildup and, possibly, kidney failure. He has seen the problem with
weightlifters who, after loading up on proteins, fail to drink
enough fluids to flush the excess nitrogen out of their systems.
</P>
<P>
   Steingard also recommends that anyone considering such a diet
get a complete blood test beforehand to make sure the person has no
underlying health problems. Then, after being on the diet for three
or four months, the person should get another test.
</P>
<P>
   Or the person could avoid all that by not going on the diet,
which is what Phoenix dietitian and nutrition consultant Claudette
Nicholas suggests. Her opinion reflects that of opponents to the
high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet: that the quick weight loss is
smoke and mirrors in the beginning and, ultimately, harmful in the
end.
</P>
<P>
   She says that such a diet deprives the body of its primary
source of fuel _ carbohydrates. When that source is depleted, the
body turns to the carbohydrates stored in muscle, leading to water
loss, and, eventually, weight loss. So most of the shed pounds
people on the diet experience is water loss, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Also, because the diet requires low carbohydrate intake, those
who practice it deprive themselves of high-fiber foods and
essential vitamins, Nicholas says. Not only that, such deprivation
eventually will lead to carbohydrate cravings, resulting in weight
gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``They make it sound really scientific, but the bottom line is,
these diets didn't work in the '70s, and they don't work now,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Labrada, a former Mr. Universe and owner of Labrada
Bodybuilding Nutrition in Houston, also is against such a diet for
people trying to lose weight quickly. It's a diet meant for those
who are obese, he says, and not for those with 10 or 20 pounds to
lose.
</P>
<P>
   That's a sentiment shared by Dan Klinder, a bodybuilder and
personal trainer in Phoenix. He usually recommends that his heavier
clients go on the diet for a set amount of time, then on a
different diet when sufficient weight is lost.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the difference in opinions, Steingard says such debates,
at the very least, get people to consider what they put in their
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting people back to thinking about what they're
eating,'' he says. ``I think that's great in and of itself. A few
of my patients have been on the high-protein diet and they say,
`Hey, it works, it's fine.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think that's another issue to bring up: If it's making
people think of what they're eating and they're doing it at home
and they're not having the fried foods and the high carbohydrates
of the candy bars, I think, just from that standpoint, it's eating
better.'' &QL;

POT ADVOCATES BUOYED BY BALLOT VICTORIES IN FIVE STATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Advocates of legalizing the use marijuana to
help treat ailments say the approval of several pro-pot ballot
initiatives Tuesday will put more pressure on the federal
government to change its hard-line stance on the drug.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at the White House drug policy office said they
were unfazed by the election results in Alaska, Arizona, Nevada,
Oregon and Washington state. The White House urged voters to reject
the measures, all similar to an initiative approved by California
voters two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not cause us to believe that marijuana is a safe
substance,'' said Jim McDonough, director of strategy for the
Office of National Drug Control Policy. ``The bottom line: It's not
science.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the initiatives, though, said the votes
demonstrated strong mainstream support that federal policy-makers
will find hard to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody, especially the drug office, thought
every one of them would pass,'' said Dave Fratello, spokesman for
the Los Angeles-based Americans for Medical Rights, which supported
the initiatives. ``This is so overwhelming, and such a rebuke. They
have to be soaking up the defeat and trying to figure out what to
do next.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has steadfastly opposed using
marijuana as a medicine, saying it is unproved, unsafe and sends
the wrong message about drug abuse to children.
</P>
<P>
   The state ballot initiatives, all tightly worded to apply only
to people with conditions such as AIDS, cancer and glaucoma, were
well-funded, with at least $2 million spent on the various
campaigns. Most of the money came from three multimillionaires,
including financier George Soros.
</P>
<P>
   In Nevada, the law requires that the initiative be voted on
again in 2000 before it could go into effect.
</P>
<P>
   A measure also was before voters in the District of Columbia,
but a last-minute provision added by Congress to the federal budget
forbids officials there from counting those votes. Still,
supporters say an exit poll showed it winning with 69 percent of
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Eligible patients in the states where the law goes into effect
likely will be issued cards to keep them from being arrested for
possessing marijuana. The measures don't allow people to sell
marijuana to those with medical needs, so patients still will have
to go to the black market, Fratello said.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, the group wants the government to reclassify
marijuana from a Schedule 1 drug, which means it has no medical
use, to a Schedule 2 or 3 drug that is regulated and can be
prescribed by a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Also under consideration is a federal judge's recommendation
that the government expand an obscure, decades-old program under
which eight people in the United States are getting marijuana for
medical purposes. The move could settle a class-action lawsuit
brought against the government by people trying to gain access, but
the Justice Department has indicated it is unlikely to go along.
</P>
<P>
   Fratello said he did not expect Tuesday's election results to
lead the government to reverse itself on that lawsuit, or its
larger policy stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be hard to turn the ship of state around on this
issue,'' he said Wednesday. ``The victory last night was
overwhelming, but we know the solution is still several years
away.''
</P>
<P>
   The government could pin some incremental policy changes on an
upcoming report from the National Academy of Science's Institute of
Medicine. The report may call for more research, and possibly for
the sanctioned use of cannabis in medical settings.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Americans for Medical Rights intends to resurrect
an invalidated initiative in Colorado next year, and to have one on
the ballot in Maine as well. Also in its sights are Massachusetts,
Florida, Ohio, Illinois and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``First it was California, and maybe people wrote off California
as an anomaly,'' Fratello said. ``Now it's the entire West, which
is convincing, but it's still not the Midwest. If we're going to
continue to legitimize this, those Midwestern states are looking
like the places where we intend to go.''

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    In 1844, thousands of American evangelicals fully expected Jesus
to return. When the predicted moment passed with no Lord in glory
appearing in the clouds, his saddened followers dubbed it ``The
Great Disappointment.''
 &HT;    For conservative Christians, the 1998 midterm elections may be
the second Great Disappointment.
 &HT;    The Republican party -- heavily dependent on a base of
evangelical voters -- failed to capitalize on the biggest
presidential scandal since Watergate. Even in the South, religious
right candidates like Alabama Gov. Fob James lost.
 &HT;    In the morning-after spin, Randy Tate, president of the
Christian Coalition, and his boss, Pat Robertson, accused
mainstream Republicans of ignoring their moral concerns -- thus
alienating the party's religious right base.
 &HT;    William Bennett used the moment to hawk books -- moaning about
the ``death of outrage'' and accusing a lax electorate of caring
more about money than morals.
 &HT;    Overall, it was a bad year for religious conservatives.
 &HT;    It did not start that way. In January, as rumors of a
presidential affair circulated, Christian conservatives could
barely contain their glee: Clinton's been caught with his pants
down! As the sordid details became public, America's neo-Puritans
predicted a religious right electoral landslide in November.
 &HT;    On television and radio, Jerry Falwell, James Dobson, Gary Bauer
and Pat Robertson self-righteously smirked over sin while privately
tallying impeachment votes.
 &HT;    What happened? Most of the die-hard religious right candidates
lost.
 &HT;    In 1996, I covered the Republican National Convention for a
local newspaper. Standing on the floor -- surrounded by true
believers -- I felt I'd witnessed Gettysburg. Although half of the
delegates in attendance claimed allegiance to some conservative
religious cause, it seemed evident that they had reached their
numerical limit in the party -- and were trying the patience of
more politically skilled mainstream Republicans. They could not go
any further than this, I mused.
 &HT;    That year, they failed to deliver for Bob Dole. This year, they
failed to deliver once again. In spite of getting Christian
conservatives to the polls, they lost.
 &HT;    The problem? Numbers. Quite simply, there are not enough
religious conservatives to actually win an election. Candidates may
win with them as part of a broader constituency. But the religious
right can not win alone.
 &HT;    University of Chicago historian Martin Marty has noted that,
since the 18th century, evangelicals make up somewhere between 25
to 33 percent of America's religious population -- rarely less and
never more. Therefore, evangelical political movements depend on
the appeal their causes have for people outside their churches. In
order to succeed, they must build coalitions around common American
concerns.
 &HT;    In Texas and Florida, the Bush brothers recognized this fact.
They won with the support of the religious right, but also the
support of Hispanic, African-American, women, and some Democratic
voters to whom a more moderate agenda -- like George Bush's
``compassionate conservatism'' -- appealed.
 &HT;    The Bush brothers are not themselves evangelicals -- a crucial
fact. Conservative evangelicals generally see the world in black
and white terms and are unable, by virtue of their own theology, to
compromise with anything they view sinful. By nature,
coalition-building is difficult for them -- leaving them dependent
upon Christian conversion for new voters.
 &HT;    Therefore, conservative evangelical candidates such as Fob
James, whose political agendas were lock-step with religious right
concerns, lost. They failed to reach beyond a particular ideology
and include voters not identified with those causes. In short,
their beliefs make them unable to build a constituency -- a crucial
failure for any politician.
 &HT;    Thus, single-mindedly waving their Bibles, these darlings of the
religious right became Tuesday's biggest losers.
 &HT;    Because they hold such clear beliefs, however, when voters want
ideology evangelicals deliver. But idea-motivated elections -- such
as the 1994 midterms -- are rare events in American history.
Instead, the electorate usually casts votes for local concerns and
economic prosperity -- and it is difficult for most people to trust
television preachers with their money.
 &HT;    An economically contented electorate will be predisposed to vote
against religious right candidates -- popularly perceived as
narrow-minded and dangerous. Their moral crusades -- including
impeaching a repentant president -- frighten many Americans who
believe conservative evangelicals would undermine individual
freedoms and derail economic prosperity. Their moral agenda strikes
most of us as preachy and somehow un-American.
 &HT;    Thus, 1998 is a great disappointment. The religious right should
now realize their 1994 victory was a fluke. If Fob James can not
even win Alabama, they must understand their agenda is not
America's agenda. And Jesus did not even return to rescue the
cause. After all that work and prayer, their ``Christian'' America
is not to be.
 &HT;    What a relief for the rest of us. Thanks be to God.

   CAMBODIA-AID (PHNOM PENH, Cambodia) The international community
has pumped more than $3 billion in aid into Cambodia over the past
decade, but the impoverished and politically divided nation remains
the basket case of Southeast Asia. Riddled with corruption and
accused of numerous human rights violations, the government of
Prime Minister Hun Sen has been denied international recognition
following recent elections that the opposition says were marred by
fraud and intimidation. The political stalemate brought thousands
of demonstrators into the streets, sparking a bloody government
crackdown that sent many opposition members into exile and left
scores of people missing or dead. Among those caught up in
Cambodia's seemingly endless downward spiral is a former Seattle
refugee counselor who says he has returned to his homeland to fight
for democracy and human rights. But, just in case, he has retained
his U.S. passport.

   CAMBODIA-NEWSPAPER (PHNOM PENH, Cambodia) Publishing a fair and
objective newspaper in one of the world's most politicized,
polarized and violent societies is often difficult, sometimes
dangerous and always rewarding, according to Cambodia Daily deputy
editor Jeff Hodson, who grew up in Seattle and worked as a
journalist in Chicago for 10 years before dropping everything and
moving to Phnom Penh. Hodson, 36, says he joined the tiny paper's
highly-motivated staff -- about half foreign and half Cambodian --
because he needed a change and wanted to do some good in a society
that has seen more than its fair share of bad.

   JEFFERSON-HEMINGS-RELATIVE (Issaquah, Wash.) Five-year-old
Rebecca Westerinen believed the family oral history she learned
from her grandmother, Julia, long before genetic test results
linked her father to President Thomas Jefferson and a slave known

Jefferson and Sally Hemings begot Eston, who begot Beverly, who
bore Carl, who begot William, who begot Julia, who in turn bore
William, young Rebecca's dad.

EX-SEATTLEITE PUSHES FOR POWER OF THE PRESS IN DANGEROUS WATERS

   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ Publishing a fair and independent
newspaper in one of the world's most politicized and polarized
capitals is often difficult, sometimes dangerous and always
rewarding, according to a former Seattle resident serving as deputy
editor of the tiny but influential Cambodia Daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Cambodia, and they're not used to a free press here,''
said Jeff Hodson, a 36-year-old Whitman College graduate who left
his Chicago-area newspaper job about 18 months ago in search of
``change and humanitarianism.''
</P>
<P>
   He found opportunities for both in Phnom Penh. In the 18 months
that Hodson has worked at The Cambodia Daily, the capital has been
rocked by one major news story after another _ some ignored by the
government-controlled news media. First came a bloody coup in July
1997, followed this year by troubled parliamentary elections,
street demonstrations, a government crackdown on protests, more
charges of political killings and other human rights abuses, and a
continuing political stalemate that has seen many oppositionists
flee the country.
</P>
<P>
   Although the government of strongman Hun Sen may not agree, all
those events were covered as accurately as possible by the Daily's
35-member staff, Hodson said. Objectivity is a rarity in Cambodia,
where most news media answer to the government or to the political
parties that fund them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been accused of a lot of things _ pro-opposition,
pro-government, you name it,'' Hodson said. ``But everybody reads
us. Hun Sen reads us every morning.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cambodia Daily was founded five years ago by old Asia hand
and journalist Bernard Krisher, who remains the publisher. About 15
of its staff are foreign journalists and the rest are Cambodians.
Supported by Japanese and American assistance organizations, as
well as various U.S. and international news media, the Daily has a
masthead that states that the paper is ``dedicated to strengthening
a free press and training journalists.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Training Cambodian journalists is a major part of our work,''
said Hodson, whose father is a University of Washington Medical
School professor. ``We have seminars on various aspects of
journalism just about every day for our Cambodian colleagues. Many
of them have gone on to work for international wire services and
other newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   Although its circulation is only about 3,000, The Cambodia Daily
is required reading for diplomats, senior government officials, aid
workers, business people and any Cambodian who can afford the 1,200
riel (35 cents) cost. Cambodians also duplicate the paper on their
own copy machines, circulating it all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   The newsletter-size paper averages 16 pages Monday through
Saturday. Primarily an English-language publication, it recently
introduced a four-page Khmer language section containing the main
news stories of the day. The Khmer section is compiled by Associate
Editor Pin Sisovann, who last year spent six months at the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer on a journalism fellowship.
</P>
<P>
   A German publisher recently donated a new printing press, giving
the Daily some of the most modern production equipment in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the new machinery, the Daily has a typical cluttered
newsroom with old computers, tiny desks and hot, cramped work
spaces. The pay is low and the hours are long and hard, but it's a
labor of love for most staff members. Foreign staff average about
two years at the paper before resuming their careers elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commitment here is amazing,'' said Hodson, noting that a
recent Cambodia Daily ad in a U.S. industry magazine brought more
than 60 responses from prospective copy editors.
</P>
<P>
   Publishing under the nose of an authoritarian regime does carry
risks.
</P>
<P>
   In early October, government spokesman Khieu Kanharith
threatened to close the Daily over its coverage of a rocket attack
on a ruling party motorcade in the northern town of Siem Reap.
Khieu also warned on Oct. 5 that American and British journalists
could be ordered out of the country because the government could no
longer guarantee their safety.
</P>
<P>
   Khieu's statements drew immediate criticism from U.S. Ambassador
Kenneth Quinn, forcing the spokesman to back off. But the pressure
remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we print is closely scrutinized by editors,''
Hodson said. ``Each story is read at least four times before it is
printed. Every word, every sentence, every paragraph is attributed.
We take great care to make sure we're accurate and fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the many obstacles, The Cambodia Daily continues its
mission to strengthen the news media. And Hodson believes the
government will leave it alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, I think they're happy to have us here,'' he said.
``They can point to us and tell the world that Cambodia has a free
press.''

   Actors are tempting fate whenever they use their traditional
``break a leg'' message of good luck. Today, on average, almost
half the performers in each production in London's West End succumb
to work-related injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Randolph Evans, a neurologist at the University of Texas at
Houston, and psychologist Richard Evans of the University of
Houston surveyed 269 actors and dancers in 20 West End musicals and
plays. Behind the glitzy scenes of many productions lay a story of
high stress and occupational injury. Forty-six per cent of all
performers had sustained at least one injury in their current
production, the researchers report in Occupational and
Environmental Medicine (vol. 55, p. 585).
</P>
<P>
   Most of the injuries were sprains and strains and did not
threaten people's careers. Injuries to ankles, feet, knees and
lower legs were most common, but back and neck injuries were
frequent, too. The most dangerous show was Starlight Express, with
an average number of 2.95 injuries per performer against a West End
average of 0.87.
</P>
<P>
   Women were more likely to suffer more injuries than men,
presumably because they often wear high-heeled shoes. Sixty-one
percent of performers thought their injuries were avoidable, and
believed sets were too dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   One big problem is raked or sloping stages which are designed
with the audience, not the performers, in mind. ``It's like
standing at the top of a ski slope,'' Evans says. ``You have to put
your weight back to stand on it.'' Some West End stages have a
slope of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The West End study follows a similar survey carried out by the
same researchers on Broadway in New York. After that research, the
Actors' Equity Association of the United States _ the union of
professional actors and stage managers _ introduced guidelines
recommending a maximum stage rake of 7.5 percent. The new survey
has already led to guidelines that oblige West End producers using
raked stages to employ a ``rake specialist'' _ usually a
physiotherapist _ to help performers work safely. &QL;

   Adult height depends mostly on a single gene, say researchers in
the United States. They have shown that one gene accounts for 70
percent of the height variation in humans.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike eye color, height varies continuously across a wide
range. So geneticists have long held that, given enough nutrition,
a person will grow to a height determined by many genes. ``That
seems reasonable,'' says Walter Nance of the Medical College of
Virginia in Richmond. ``But our data suggest that it is not the
case.''
</P>
<P>
   Nance noticed that people with an abnormality that gives them
three sex chromosomes, such as XXX or XYY, are unusually tall. So
he turned his attention to phog, a gene that is known to influence
height and is found on both sex chromosomes. He and his colleagues
tested 140 pairs of nonidentical twins and their parents to see
which version of the gene each carried.
</P>
<P>
   Twins who had inherited the same version of the gene from their
mother, as well as the same version from their father, were roughly
the same height at the age of 15, whereas twins who shared the phog
gene from only one parent were less likely to be the same height.
Twins who had neither copy of phog in common were the most
different in stature.
</P>
<P>
   Computer analysis of the twin data suggests that phog accounts
for most of the height variation in the population studied, Nance
says, and probably in the population at large. He adds that the
protein product of the phog gene is thought to regulate other genes
in bone cells. Because there was no height correlation to phog
before twins reached puberty, the gene may be involved in
controlling pubescent spurts in growth.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Tishler, a medical geneticist from Harvard Medical School,
says that while twin studies often fail to take confounding
variables into account, Nance's work looks solid. ``What he does is
much more sophisticated,'' Tishler says. &QL;

   Researchers in the United States predict that within five years
they will be able to help some blind people to ``see.'' After
successfully transmitting simple electronic images directly to 15
blind people's retinas, they hope to make devices similar to the
one used by blind engineer Jordi Laforge in ``Star Trek: The Next
Generation.''
</P>
<P>
   The team, headed by Mark Humayun at Johns Hopkins Hospital in
Baltimore, report that all 15 patients have been able to see either
spots of light or more complex patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see light after so long, it was just wonderful. It was
blue,'' says 71-year-old Harold Churchey, describing his first
visual experience after 15 years of blindness. ``It was just like
switching a light on.'' Churchey, who lost his sight because of the
degenerative eye condition retinitis pigmentosa, is one of the
group to whom the team have been able to give some fleeting vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great,'' Churchey said. ``They showed me the letter
'H'. I had trouble seeing the bottom part at first so I thought it
was a 'U.' But it was very clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Humayun previously demonstrated that a person who has lost
his/her sight through diseases of that affect the rods and cones _
the cells in the retina that detect light and color _ could be made
to see spots of light. This was done by bypassing the rods and
cones, and electrically stimulating bunches of the still healthy
nerve cells _ the ganglia _ behind the retina with single
electrodes. But he was unsure whether the brain could make sense of
more than one artificial signal at a time and worried that the
spots would merge. &QL;

   Imagine an advertising board with a full-color, moving hologram
of a hand reaching for a bottle and pouring a drink. This could
soon be a reality thanks to a London photographic laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Medora and Nigel Robiette of Colourholographics have
produced full-color, animated holograms up to half a meter square.
Their holograms are animated as the viewer walks past or moves
his/her head from side to side. ``No one has done full-color at
this size before,'' Medora says. ``The big challenge was
superimposing three holograms on one emulsion to get the red, green
and blue needed for true color.''
</P>
<P>
   By harnessing rostrum camera techniques from the movie industry,
the pair were able to achieve the accurate registration of image
frames needed for large holograms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other holographers use computers to make small images, but to
do big images you need to use film techniques,'' Medora says.
Computer imaging systems do not have high enough resolution for
large holograms. So instead of making holograms with a laser, the
images are first shot using conventional 35 millimeter film. A
tracked camera moves past the scene being recorded, capturing a
slightly different view on each frame of film. In the final
hologram, these frames are redirected to slightly different
viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hologram is like a window _ you can mask off areas and open
up others _ so you can use holography to store frames and animate
them,'' Medora says. To do this, a laser records each frame onto a
master holographic plate through a narrow vertical aperture, which
moves along the plate between frames.
</P>
<P>
   By reversing the master plate and making a holographic copy of
it, the final hologram recreates the effect of the apertures in
front of the image, so only one frame is seen from a particular
viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   The hologram can record motion as long as there aren't large
differences in the positions of objects between frames that would
destroy the stereo effect. Up to 150 frames can be recorded onto an
emulsion 7 micrometers thick, providing six seconds of animation.
Any footage containing a tracking shot can be used, so posters for
Hollywood blockbusters could now feature three-dimensional movie
clips. &QL;

paralyzed and internationally isolated, the country of 11 million
people has been hit by drought, pestilence, increasing food
shortages and rising crime, including robberies and kidnappings of
foreigners. Tourism barely exists. Prostitution runs rampant, along
with AIDS. As many as 6 million land mines litter the countryside,
and warlords rule many areas. In the north and northwest, the last
remnants of the communist Khmer Rouge _ whose 1975-79 reign of
terror killed as many as 2 million people _ continue to mount
small-scale guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Cambodia, by all accounts, is the basket case of Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Ou spent 11 years in Seattle, much of it as a refugee social
worker with the Asian Counseling and Referral Service. He was one
of thousands of Cambodians who immigrated to the Puget Sound region
but maintained close links with their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   With at least 25,000 to 30,000 Cambodian immigrants, Washington
state has one of the largest Cambodian American communities in the
United States. Ou, using the education and experience he gained in
the United States, has trained Cambodians in social work, human
rights and democracy since his return.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few years, however, he came to the conclusion that
no one was really listening, and that the only way to bring change
to Cambodia was through political power _ forcing reform from the
top down. So he joined a political party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked about democracy, human rights and helping others for
six years, but nobody was really applying these principles,'' said
Ou, now a senior official in the opposition Sam Rainsy Party. ``So
I decided I needed some power of my own in order to actually apply
the principles I've been preaching for the past six years.''
</P>
<P>
   That somewhat authoritarian approach to democracy may indeed be
a prerequisite for change here, but it underscores the polarization
that has cotributed to Cambodia's seemingly endless downward
spiral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody talks about democracy and the popular will, but
everybody means something different by it,'' says Chea Vannath,
president of the Center for Social Development in Phnom Penh. ``If
you have three Cambodians, you have three single-minded solutions,
and no one is willing to compromise. They all want their own way.''
</P>
<P>
   That lack of cooperation is evident in the current political
stalemate that has paralyzed the country. The government of
strongman Hun Sen has been denied international recognition despite
its self-declared victory in July 26 parliamentary elections that
the opposition says were marked by fraud and intimidation. Hun
Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party, or CPP, won 64 of 122 seats
but failed to garner the two-thirds majority needed to form a
government on its own.
</P>
<P>
   The two opposition groups _ Prince Norodom Ranariddh's Funcinpec
Party and the Sam Rainsy Party _ have allied and refuse to join the
CPP in a coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Charges of vote fraud brought thousands of demonstrators into
the streets in late August and early September, sparking a
government crackdown that left scores of people missing or dead and
eventually sent many opposition members into exile.
</P>
<P>
   The stalemate has worsened an already desperate situation.
Cambodia's U.N. seat was declared vacant after a bloody coup last
year. Most foreign aid donors have delayed new programs or
suspended assistance altogether, pending completion of the July
elections and establishment of a credible coalition government.
Foreign aid is critical for Cambodia, providing an estimated 50
percent of its national budget in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Although there have been some reverberations from Asia's
yearlong financial crisis, most Cambodians are so far removed from
the economic mainstream that the regional turmoil has had no impact
on their impoverished lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy here is so unintegrated that there was hardly any
affect at all,'' said Jeff Hodson, deputy editor of The Phnom Penh
Daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cambodia's future looks very bleak politically,'' said Kao Kim
Hourn, another former U.S. refugee who is now executive director of
the Cambodian Institute for Cooperation and Peace, a Phnom Penh
think tank. ``If the political situation is not settled, the
economic and security situation won't improve either.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the opposition may have legitimate complaints about the
electoral process, many diplomats and analysts urge the two sides
to compromise and form a government as soon as possible. And while
international observers may have too hastily declared the July
elections free and fair, most believe that addressing opposition
complaints would not substantially change the overall poll results.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes two to tango, and right now, each side _ the
opposition and the government _ is equally responsible for the
stalemate,'' Kao said. ``They are not talking to each other; they
are talking past each other. The opposition and the government have
got to consider the well-being of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   But social well-being has never been high on Cambodia's official
agenda. With a per capita income of just $300 a year, corruption
runs rampant. Teachers demand payments from students for passing
grades. Firemen refuse to douse fires without a cash advance.
Medical treatment is denied unless the patient pays first.
Thousands of people on the payrolls of government ministries seldom
show up for work. Hundreds of dirty, malnourished children and
handicapped people beg on the poorly maintained streets of the
capital, where the palatial mansions of the rich tower behind high
walls topped with barbed-wire.
</P>
<P>
   A poll conducted by Chea Vannath's Center for Social Development
found that 98 percent of Cambodians believe it is ``very important
to end corruption'' and the vicious cycle of poverty that it
breeds.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, no one quite knows how to do it. Despite all the aid
and the presence of scores of foreign experts and humanitarian
agencies, social problems overwhelm Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the spread of AIDS, the poor health of the people,
malnutrition, drug trafficking, prostitution, human trafficking,
the logging of our forests and other environmental degradation,''
Chea said. ``But when we raise our concerns about any of these
social issues with the government, they take it personally. . . .
Everything is very, very politicized, and most of the social issues
just go unsolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, the government has a beautiful national plan with
plenty of international experts helping out, but implementation is
another thing,'' she added. ``There is no political will by the
leaders to tackle these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   So what more can an increasingly frustrated international
community do? Chea and other Cambodian activists believe developed
nations must remain committed to democratic change in Cambodia and
increase pressure on the government and politicians to settle their
differences and focus on the country's many problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international community says it doesn't want to interfere
in our affairs _ that it's a domestic issue,'' Chea said. ``That's
very nice, but we can't solve it ourselves. We need help. I'm
afraid the international community is suffering compassion
fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, as Hun Sen and the opposition remain locked in their
power struggle, some Cambodians still see a glimmer of hope for
their country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international investment in our country is not
worthless,'' said Lao Mong Hay, executive director of The Khmer
Institute of Democracy. ``Ninety percent of our voters turned out
for the July elections. In villages all over the country, they
queued up from early morning until midday to cast their ballots.
Peasants, students and others held peaceful demonstrations for
democracy. . . . They are involved in the making of a free nation.
They want freedom from the bottom of their hearts, and some of them
died for it. It is our responsibility to ensure that they are not
forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Ou Bun Long, he says he'll continue his work for the
opposition and for democracy in hopes of eventually landing a
government position, possibly as human rights chief.
</P>
<P>
   Just in case, Ou hangs on to his U.S. passport. If necessary, he
can return to Seattle, where his children live.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a U.S. citizen and I can go to the U.S. Embassy for help
in case anything happens,'' he said. ``I've already talked to them
about it.''

 (She also has information on how to subscribe to Hollywood Stars, a
weekly column with color art.) 
 &HT;    
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    For nearly 60 years Lew Wasserman was one of the most powerful
men in America.
 &HT;    Wasserman and his mentor and partner in MCA/Universal Pictures,
Dr. Jules Stein, made superstars of Bette Davis, Cary Grant, Paul
Newman, Marilyn Monroe and Fred Astaire.
 &HT;    Without them Ronald Reagan might have remained a B-picture actor
past his prime, and Steven Spielberg might still be just a Long
Beach State dropout with a yen to make pictures.
 &HT;    These are some of the revelations made by Dennis McDougal in his
bombshell new book, ``The Last Mogul: Lew Wasserman, MCA, and the
Hidden History of Hollywood'' (Crown Books).
 &HT;    McDougal writes that Wasserman and Stein underwrote the
presidential aspirations of Ronald Reagan, who owed them both big
time. In the '50s, they gave him a new career on TV with General
Electric theater. In exchange, as president of the Screen Actors
Guild, Reagan sold his union members down the river by denying
their request for residuals from TV producers like Universal.
 &HT;    ``At the same time,'' says Dennis McDougal, ``Reagan is doing
side deals with Universal that keeps their studio working
throughout the SAG strike.''
 &HT;    With massive research and in meticulous detail, McDougal, a
former Los Angeles Times writer, charts the rise of Wasserman, the
boy from the wrong side of the Cleveland tracks, who started his
career as a cinema usher and rose to the top of the Hollywood heap.
 &HT;    Wasserman and Stein, first as agents then as heads of a movie
empire which encompassed films, music, theme parks and television,
developed a stranglehold on the entertainment industry.
 &HT;    Their methods, McDougal asserts, included every form of coercion
up to and including blackmail. And at the height of their power,
scarcely a picture could be made in America without their say-so.
 &HT;    Presiding over his kingdom from his Universal City black tower,
Wasserman was an enigma. Tall and very thin, with a thick crest of
snow white hair, thick black horn rimmed glasses and an
undertaker's costume of dark suit, white shirt and thin dark tie,
with nary a cigar in sight, he is scarcely the central casting
mogul of Hollywood mythology.
 &HT;    McDougal, whose book looks set to break over the back lots of
Hollywood like an incendiary device, blasts the enigma apart to
offer a grimy backstage reality behind the glittering Hollywood
facade.
 &HT;    Among the revelations: Wasserman, son of Russian immigrants,
loved only two things, money and movies and began his ties with
organized crime through his wife Edie whose attorney father Henry
Beckerman was a front man for the Moe Dalitz Mayfield gang of
Cleveland.
 &HT;    ``Nobody understood,'' contends McDougal, ``that the organized
crime strike force was interested (in MCA's ties to the mob) to the
point where they convened not one but two grand juries to
investigate MCA.''
 &HT;    The feds had received an anonymous letter, which McDougal prints
in the book, that alleged that Wasserman had hired a hit man to
kill his daughter's boyfriend.
 &HT;    Investigations of MCA and Wasserman however had a habit of
coming to naught. One Justice Department probe came to a grinding
halt in the '60s after the death of Marilyn Monroe who was
threatening to reveal all about her relationship with U.S. Attorney
General Robert Kennedy. McDougal implies that Kennedy may have
pulled off his attack dogs in exchange for Wasserman's assistance
with Kennedy's entanglement with Monroe.
 &HT;    The federal prosecutor who was pursuing MCA retired and moved to
a Beverly Hills law firm, where he suddenly died of a heart attack
at 47.
 &HT;    ``I've already been criticized in one prepublication review for
being strong on innuendo,'' McDougal admits. ``There are bold flat
statements about these deaths that I didn't make in the book and I
can't make them now. But I do think it's curious and worthy of
attention because both the Monroe death and the prosecutor's death
came at fortuitously convenient times. Maybe MCA just happened to
get lucky and these two thorns in their souls just happened to
expire at the same time in untimely ways.''
 &HT;    More solid is the story of the end of Tennessee Sen. Estes
Kefauver's investigation into the mob which had also drawn
perilously close to Wasserman and MCA, when the senator had the
misfortune to be found in bed in a New York hotel room with not one
but two hostesses from the nearby Chez Paree nightclub. The
incident found its way, in slightly altered form, into the Francis
Ford Coppola's Godfather epic.
 &HT;    In the year that Teamster chief Jimmy Hoffa disappeared and
gangster Sam Giancana was gunned down, Wasserman and his Hollywood
lawyer Sydney Korshak became more and more afraid, writes
McDougall. Korshak began traveling with a bodyguard and Wasserman
beefed up security at his Beverly Hills home and had his drivers
taught how to throw off a pursuit.
 &HT;    If Wasserman's business universe was suspect, his personal life
as depicted by McDougal, is a put under a harsh light. Sure to be
criticized for his revelations about the private life of Edie
Wasserman, a respected Los Angeles-based philanthropist, McDougal
says it was absolutely germane to his portrait of Wasserman the
mogul.
 &HT;    ``If you don't understand that Lew had no home life and that his
relationship with his wife at some point evolved into an almost
brother and sister relationship then you don't really understand
what made the guy run. He hated to go home. I mean to this day when
he's 85 and virtually retired, I understand he goes into the office
every day and does not relish the idea of having to go home,''
McDougal said.
 &HT;    Today MCA is owned by Seagram Co. Ltd.(who bought it from the
Japanese company Matsushita in 1995) and as depicted by McDougal,
the last mogul is a lonely figure with a poor relationship with his
only daughter, a strange marriage and no deep friendships.
 &HT;    ``He has no broad sweep of close friends that he can just sit
and shmooze with or feel close to,'' says McDougal. ``He's very
isolated , very alone. And I feel a certain compassion for him.''
 &HT;    In Hollywood where he has been a towering figure, and a large
donor to charities taking on Lew Wasserman even in the twilight of
his years, is a brave endeavor.
 &HT;    Says McDougal, ``One of his MCA vice presidents told me that the
most chilling thing you could ever hear was that Lew was
'disappointed in you.'''
 &HT;    McDougal admits there is much to admire in the man. ``I think he
has a very strong sense of what is good. But he compartmentalizes.
He is very capable of destroying a career and the next day ...
speak passionately and sincerely about helping labor get a decent
contract. He has many good sides but he's capable of being
absolutely ruthless.''

WHEN YOUR CHILD STEALS FOR ATTENTION
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Dr. Joy Browne, a licensed psychologist, has joined the New
York Times Syndicate to give your readers the warm, friendly _ and
professional _ advice that she supplies to 9 million listeners in
the United States and Canada through the WOR Radio Network. Her
weekly Q&AMP;A column, ``Dr.Joy,'' will answer readers' questions about
personal relationships that are key in having happy and productive
lives.) 
 By DR. JOY BROWNE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUESTION: My 10-year-old son is bringing home all sorts of
goodies from school. I don't think they're his, but I don't want to
accuse him of stealing. How common is stealing with kids, and if I
ignore it, are banks next? _ Chattanooga, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: It's not unusual for kids to steal, but it's not
something you want to encourage as a way to garner attention. Don't
condone or ignore his stealing, but shift the emphasis from
negative to positive. Make sure he is not stealing to get
attention. You don't need your kid to be the first jailbird in the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   If your son is stealing, ask yourself why he is doing this. Who
sees his booty? If no one, he probably wants it for its own sake.
If he shows his friends, he wants their approval. If he shows you,
he's most likely asking for help. He's figured out how to get your
attention, and unfortunately punishing him will only emphasize the
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Does he have an older sibling who gets a lot of attention for
sports or grades? Or a new baby in the house? Then he needs
reinforcement from you, including gold stars on the forehead, pats
on the back for positive behavior and help in making purchases.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to accuse him of stealing. Just explain you're
uncomfortable with his trading efforts and to cut it out before
other parents object. Suggest he takes no goodies to school and
brings no goodies home. If he doesn't already have an allowance or
job to pay for his own ``must-haves,'' institute a series of chores
to earn money that you will match.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I've been going with a woman 20 years my junior for a
little over a year. She's been divorced for a little under a year.
While she was married, she had numerous affairs. When I asked her
about them, she gave me sketchy details. Later I found out she'd
lied about the number and length of affairs. I want to leave her,
but I'm supporting her and her two children, ages 5 and 9, since
she doesn't work and doesn't receive sufficient alimony. What
should I do? _ Toronto
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: Heavens! So many red flares shot up as I read your
letter my office is on fire. Despite your noble intentions, you've
stumbled into nearly every relationship pitfall there is.
</P>
<P>
   What she did before is none of your business. What matter is
what's going on between the two of you today. Stop supporting this
woman, so both of you can evaluate your feelings for each other.
She needs to grow up, get a job and realize that a romance is not a
rescue. Stop being ``Wally the Wallet'' and take a breather from
this troubled relationship for six months.
</P>
<P>
   After that your head should be clear enough to see who this
woman is as a person _ not a project. If at that time, you still
want to pursue a relationship, proceed with caution. You never know
when a booby trap might spring up and bop you on the shins again.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I'm a guy trying to save money to buy a car, so I'm
living at home while I attend college. But my parents wait up for
me every night and want to know everything that goes on in my life.
Aren't I entitled to any privacy? _ Milwaukee
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: Of course, but you may have to get it the old-fashioned
way _ earn it by moving out. Everything in this life has a price
tag. You're finding the price tag for free room and board is
expensive in terms of personal privacy and independence.
</P>
<P>
   Live under your parents' roof and I guarantee you're going to be
treated like a child whether you're 14 or 114. If you're unwilling
to change your living arrangements, compromise. Volunteer
information if they promise not to ask. Tell them you'll be home by
a certain time and say goodnight when you get in. Your parents are
always going to be interested in your life even after you move out.
It doesn't mean they're nosy, just that they're your parents and
they love you.
</P>
<P>
   Your best long-term solution is to earn more independence, which
may mean finding less luxurious housing with a friend, foregoing
the car temporarily, getting a job or finding campus housing in
exchange for some work. Not only will your parents drive you less
crazy, but you'll also feel a lot more grown up.

   MITCH-NICARAGUA (Posoltega, Nicaragua) -- Officials say they

LIFE `WITH OSSIE &AMP; RUBY' IS A STORY OF HAPPINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE GANAHL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``We found after 30 years of talking to
audiences that the questions changed from `How do you get into show
business' to `What are the secrets to staying married so long?'''
chuckles veteran stage-and-screen actor Ossie Davis, the strength
of his basso profundo belying his 80 years of age.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we decided to write this book. To see if others might
benefit from what we'd learned.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Ruby Dee, his wife of 50 years and acclaimed actor in her
own right, ``It was a difficult process to bring it all together _
the rhythms of our personal life, the politics we were involved in,
and how we fit into that total pattern. But it was very
invigorating.''
</P>
<P>
   It took Dee and Davis two years to finish ``With Ossie &AMP; Ruby:
In This Life Together'' (William Morrow) a compelling memoir just
released to bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Ossie &AMP; Ruby'' sets their half-century-long marriage
against the backdrop of history, especially in regard to the
struggle for civil rights. Dee and Davis risked alienation from the
power establishment by devoting themselves to causes _ from Martin
Luther King to Malcolm X. Despite brushes with McCarthyism in the
'50s, they still managed to get choice roles. (Each has been
nominated for several Emmys, and are favorites of director Spike
Lee, who has cast them in many of his films, including ``Jungle
Fever'' and ``Do the Right Thing.'')
</P>
<P>
   They say their common passion for social change was one thing
that made their marriage flourish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were born into a struggle that was real, a life and death
one,'' says Davis, whose rural Georgia hometown was terrorized by
the Ku Klux Klan in his childhood. ``So the struggle was one of the
things that kept us together. We rarely had time to ask ourselves
`Are we happy, are our needs being met?' We had to be always on the
ready for combat.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Dee, who was raised in Harlem, ``We've had the same
challenges faced by all couples when they're married. But the
struggle was our common jumping-off point, and it gave us a sense
of something larger than us.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis and Dee met while performing together at the American
Negro Theatre in Harlem. Her first impressions of him were not
immensely favorable. She writes that his clothes were definitely
all wrong _ ``a tall, skinny man dressed in the well-worn apparel
of a short, fat man.'' He found his future wife more pleasing:
``like a teen-ager with long, plaited hair and big eyes _ a very
nice-looking young lady who turned out to be Ruby Dee.''
</P>
<P>
   The he-said/she-said format of ``Ossie &AMP; Ruby'' works
wonderfully, giving readers two sides of every anecdote. Dee says
they were a bit concerned about divulging intimate details of their
early courtship. ``But our children are all in their 40s now, so
we're all adults. In fact, our son called us in tears after he read
the book, to thank us for sharing ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said there were other difficulties involved in the
writing. ``Well, I found out a lot of things about Ruby's life that
I never knew! And in summing up your life you are forced to look at
what you've accomplished. But by and large we feel like we've done
pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   And their marriage is one thing they are the most proud of. Do
they have any sure-fire techniques to share?
</P>
<P>
   Laughs Davis, ``The most important thing I learned that helped
me enjoy 50 years of marriage was listening, and to always consider
what I'm listening to. It wasn't always easy. But I think I came
out of each session a little smarter.''
</P>
<P>
   And Dee denounces the notion that their marriage is the model of
smoothness. ``Let's say we're in the process of mastering it. Every
age, every year is an opportunity for new discoveries about each
other. For that we are grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   Do they have plans to retire, to just relax and do nothing for a
change?
</P>
<P>
   Dee laughs. ``Well, we never did get into fishing!''
</P>
<P>
   And Davis adds: ``Oh, that will never happen. There's so much to
be done! And the more we learn about life the more it seems there
is to do.''

<P>
   Spurred by fierce competition for students, colleges and
universities from Florida State to New York University are plunging
headlong into the rapidly evolving world of online education, a
world that barely existed five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, technologically adventurous professors worked
the Internet into their courses, posting the syllabus or readings,
sometimes responding to student queries. Some of the more
proficient put courses online. But only recently have universities
begun to offer whole programs and degrees on line, where a student
can sign up for a bachelor's, a master's or even a law degree _ the
1990s version of a correspondence course.
</P>
<P>
   No college can be certain whether the programs will attract
enough students to justify the considerable expense _ $50,000 or
more to create and support each class. But school officials say
that if they do not stake out territory in cyberspace now, someone
else will.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the hottest and most sweeping development I've ever
seen,'' said James H. Ryan, a vice president at Pennsylvania State
University, who has been in higher education for 35 years. ``It's
like being in a roller coaster; it's a thrill a minute.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as universities stampede onto the Internet, significant
questions have yet to be answered. How good is the education? Who
owns the courses _ the university or the professors who create
them? How should faculty members be paid? What works best in online
teaching? And will a degree from a virtual university be worth the
actual paper it is printed on?
</P>
<P>
   Frank Mayadas, a program officer at the Alfred P. Sloan
Foundation in New York, which has financed programs to improve
online teaching, said the picture was mixed. Some online degrees,
like Stanford University's master's degree in electrical
engineering or Drexel University's masters in information systems,
are sound, Mayadas said. But he is skeptical that other offerings
will endure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The predictability we associate with higher education
institutions isn't there yet,'' he said, ``and it needs to be there
for this to become a credible source of education.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, online classes are a considerable step up from
correspondence schools. Internet bulletin boards function as
virtual classrooms for students and teachers who can participate at
any time, from anywhere, using a computer and a modem. Instructors
post lectures and assignments; students turn in papers and tests
and discuss their studies with classmates and professors in online
conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Michele Acuna of Saugus, Calif., a 34-year-old mother with two
teen-agers who is working on a bachelor's degree from the
University of Phoenix, signs on almost every day to the Hewlett
Packard computer in her bedroom for a communications course. Her
professor is in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do a lot at night when my children are in bed,'' she said.
``That's the beauty of this stuff _ you can do it at 3 a.m.''

 UNDATED: at 3 a.m.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one knows exactly how many colleges operate on the Internet.
But what is clear is that the trend is picking up speed nationwide:
</P>
<P>
   _ New York University announced this month an audacious plan to
create a profit-seeking subsidiary to market Internet courses. The
venture would allow NYU to raise millions of dollars through a
stock offering or private partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   _ The University of Phoenix, a for-profit behemoth that has
officials at many traditional universities scared because of its
rapid spread online, has nearly 5,000 students in its online
program, more than double the number two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   _ Western Governors University, an online college sponsored by
17 states and Guam, was started this fall to improve access to
college education for adults and to help accommodate an expected
crush of students without building classrooms. The university
offers associate's degrees in liberal arts and applied science.
</P>
<P>
   _ The California Virtual University, a consortium of nearly 100
California universities and colleges, opened this fall with more
than 1,600 online courses.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Open University _ Britain's 29-year-old pioneer in
distance education for college students _ has applied for American
accreditation and is striking cooperative agreements with
universities like Florida State University.
</P>
<P>
   _ Penn State established its online ``World Campus'' in February
with just four courses and expects to have 30 courses by next
February.
</P>
<P>
   _ Florida State will begin offering courses next fall for a
bachelor's degree, but will concentrate on course work for juniors
and seniors.
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of online programs has many traditional
educators scratching their heads. A committee of the American
Association of University Professors concluded last year that
online learning could be ``a valuable pedagogical tool to increase
access to higher education.'' But it warned that developments could
compromise traditional notions of academic quality, academic
freedom, intellectual property rights and instructors' workloads
and compensation. In some cases, long-standing safeguards of
faculty members' rights may suffice, it said, but in others, those
protections may need reworking.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a traditional classroom course, for which a professor
creates and delivers each course, the professor becomes more
dispensable online after putting the course together in a form that
can be sent out again and again. Another instructor can be assigned
to answer questions and grade papers.
</P>
<P>
   Universities are creating different arrangements to determine
who owns what. Penn State, for example, is splitting revenues with
the faculty members who develop the courses and their departments,
while New York University says its new subsidiary will hold
ownership rights for the online courses.
</P>
<P>
   The student body for most online courses is part-time adults in
continuing education programs or full-time degree-seekers who take
most of their work in traditional classrooms. But the trend is to
make it possible to earn a degree online rather than just take a
few individual classes.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Carlo, a sophomore majoring in applied math and physics
at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, took a computer science
course online in the spring when he could not fit the regular
course into his schedule. He found the flexibility a mixed
blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice that you didn't have to be somewhere from 4 to
5:30 twice a week,'' Carlo said. ``The negative is that you really
have to keep on top of the work.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Acuna is using her computer for all of her courses. She said
she had always wanted a college degree. But as a single mother with
a full-time job as an operations manager for a retail chain with
night and weekend shifts, she could not commit to regular-class
attendance.
</P>
<P>
   She looked into several online programs before enrolling as a
business major at the University of Phoenix. At $370 a credit ($465
for graduate work), Phoenix charges more than the local community
college. Phoenix students typically take one course at a time for
five weeks, and then have a week off before starting the next.
</P>
<P>
   The only requirement Ms. Acuna was not able to fulfill at home
was the university's entrance examination, which she took at a
local school.
</P>
<P>
   In her current communications course she and her five classmates
write essays, read them and discuss them in teams _ but talk about
little else. There is no sense of a campus community, but she does
not mind.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Internet education is taking clearer shape, some
university officials are taking a closer look at the business
aspects.
</P>
<P>
   Active marketing is a major component of the NYU plan. Rather
than aiming to put all the courses it can on the Web, the
university is hoping to start with a dozen or so niche courses _
like computer and management courses that will be attractive to
people in industry. As these courses bring in revenues, others will
be added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online is a big, important field in higher education, but it
does not have a business model that works,'' said Gerald A. Heeger,
dean of Continuing and Professional Studies at NYU, who is
directing the university's new online enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dirty, little secret is that nobody's making any money,''
Heeger said. But someday they will, he added.

49ERS TRIM PRACTICE TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CRUMPACKER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ To keep his players fresh in the second
half of the season, San Francisco 49ers coach Steve Mariucci has
trimmed about 10-15 minutes from the daily practice. The shortened
sessions will benefit players with nagging injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did that last year,'' Mariucci said Wednesday, his 43rd
birthday. ``We want to freshen up a little bit and have less time
on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   The team is preparing for Carolina after Sunday's loss to the
Green Bay Packers. Mariucci said he expected at least as good an
effort in the second half of the season as the 49ers gave in the
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``You start over. This is our opener,'' he said. ``Whoever
handles this eight-game season the best will get the bye, will get
the home field advantage. If we take care of business in the second
half of the season, we'll be in good shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect our team to respond the right way. I expect our team
to regroup and play an emotional game Sunday against Carolina. I
expect us to play hard and with emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci also said it was important not to ``wallow around in
meaningless confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   As opposed to meaningful confusion, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gabe Wilkins, who had knee surgery in May, will play
against Atlanta next week. Wilkins has been practicing with the
team since last week, Mariucci said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a heck of a pass rush drill, much better than last
week. We have to make sure (his knee is) not going to swell up. If
he can put a couple-three practices back to back to back we'll
activate him fairly soon.''

MICROSOFT'S LATEST: A TELEPHONE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (af) 
 By PETER H. LEWIS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. does not go softly into hardware. When it
decides to enter a hardware niche, it typically has a good reason.
The rise of graphical user interfaces like the Windows shell
demanded a mouse, and Microsoft is now the big cheese in computer
mice.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's game-software division is a powerhouse, so the
company is trying to conquer the market for game paraphernalia like
joysticks, steering wheels and stereo speakers. William H. Gates
became a daddy, and now there is the Microsoft Actimates
Interactive Barney doll.
</P>
<P>
   And now Microsoft is going after the cordless phone business,
which says a lot about the company's vision for the future. It is a
future that blends telecommunications, consumer electronics and
computing, and it envisions increasing reliance on voice commands
to control common household devices _ that, not coincidentally, use
Microsoft operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's latest hardware product is a $199 cordless telephone
that connects to a personal computer and uses Windows-based call
management software. In theory, the Microsoft Cordless Phone
System, officially known as the PC Phone System MP-900, is supposed
to harness the power of the PC to improve the way we use the
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of weeks of testing the MP-900, I find it hard to
give it a ringing endorsement. Even so, the ideas behind the PC
Phone System MP-900 are so compelling that I eagerly await version
2.0.
</P>
<P>
   The MP-900 is a black, 900-megahertz cordless phone that comes
with a desktop cradle, a base station that connects to a PC and a
CD-ROM disk with call management software. In general,
900-megahertz phones are significantly superior to the
first-generation cordless phones, which operated at 46 to 49 MHz.
</P>
<P>
   The software enables the user to set up a voice mail system,
with separate voice-mail boxes for each member of a family or small
business.
</P>
<P>
   A voice command system lets the user make calls by simply
speaking the name of the recipient, once that name and phone number
are entered in a speed-dial directory. Up to 40 names can be
entered.
</P>
<P>
   For example, to call one's bookmaker, one simply presses the
voice command button on the handset and says, ``Call Weasel.''
(Your bookie's name may vary.) The phone looks up Weasel's number
in the PC database, dials it and logs the call.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the first successful examples of speech recognition
in my house, certainly more impressive than when I try to summon my
teen-ager by voice.
</P>
<P>
   If the user subscribes to a Caller ID service through the phone
company, the software can recognize calls from certain individuals
and play a custom greeting whenever that person calls.
</P>
<P>
   The phone handset also uses voice synthesis to announce incoming
calls. ``Gates, Bill, calling.'' Thus, the user can screen calls
even when away from the PC. Voice messages are stored on the
computer's hard disk and can be played back, even from a remote
location.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds great in theory. But to be broadly successful,
consumer electronics devices have to be relatively inexpensive,
simple to learn, easy to use, reliable and so compelling that
people eventually wonder how they ever survived without one.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone is one example, and the radio, the television, the
VCR, the stereo and the microwave oven are others.
</P>
<P>
   By those standards, the Microsoft Cordless Phone has not quite
made the connection. First, $199 is a lot to spend on a
single-line, 900-megahertz analog cordless phone.
</P>
<P>
   For just a few dollars more, you can get 2.4-gigahertz digital
spread-spectrum cordless phone with greater range, two-line
capability and protection against electronic eavesdroppers. (The
problem with many analog cordless phones is that your conversations
can sometimes be picked up on the neighbor's baby monitor.)
</P>
<P>
   Or you can buy a 900-MHz digital cordless phone with many useful
features for much less than $199. Sony just introduced several new
900-MHz digital phones, for slightly more money, that match some of
the more appealing features of the Microsoft phone, without the
need for a PC.
</P>
<P>
   While more than 70 percent of American households have a
cordless phone already, fewer than 45 percent have a PC, and of
those, not all have the features needed to operate the Microsoft
phone. These include a Pentium 90 processor (or faster) running
Windows 95 or 98, a vacant serial port, 32 megabytes of RAM, up to
100 megabytes of hard disk space and a Windows-compatible 16-bit
sound card with a microphone and speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the more appealing features require Caller ID, a
subscription service offered by local phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   The phone will not work with Windows NT, and there are no plans
to create a Macintosh version, Microsoft said.
</P>
<P>
   Connecting the MP-900 to my Windows PC was harder than I thought
it would be and required much fussing over serial ports. The
software installed easily, but it refused to work until other phone
extensions on the line were disconnected.
</P>
<P>
   The phone's battery must be charged for 10 hours before use,
which might frustrate users who require instant gratification.
</P>
<P>
   The special call management software is relatively easy to
configure. But it was unnecessarily difficult to import the
hundreds of names and telephone numbers I have collected in
Microsoft Outlook into the new phone's directory. The idea of
re-entering all those numbers manually was too much to bear. The
thought of attempting a link with Sidekick or some other
non-Microsoft contact-management software was truly odious.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how I tweaked the software, the phone refused to play
the custom announcements I lovingly recorded for special callers _
the Wicked Witch theme song for one, the submarine ``battle
stations'' sound effects for another, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the largest drawback is that to take advantage of all
the advanced features, you must leave the PC turned on. If the PC
is switched off or crashes, the MP-900 becomes a very expensive
cordless phone.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there a headset option for the MP-900, which disqualifies
it for use as my primary office phone.
</P>
<P>
   The sound quality of messages played back through my computer's
speakers was erratic, fading in and out. On the flip side, my
digital cellular phone is much less reliable, and I still put up
with it.
</P>
<P>
   On balance, the MP-900 is a clever device, and its call
management software deserves to be incorporated into future
generations of desktop and cordless phones. But the price is still
a bit steep, the inconveniences still outweigh the advantages, and
non-PC cordless phone technologies offer some of the same features.
</P>
<P>
   In last week's column about Macintosh OS 8.5, a brief reference
was made to the ``Revision B'' iMac computer. Apple would neither
confirm nor deny what it said were ``rumors'' about the existence
of the new model. Here are the details: Since introducing the iMac
in July, Apple has made several improvements to the original model,
including adding a faster graphics chip and more video RAM (6 MB
versus 2 MB). These Revision B iMacs come from the factory with Mac
OS 8.5 installed instead of 8.1.

DELL BEATS COMPAQ IN BUSINESS MARKET  
 CABLE GETS EVEN MORE CONFUSING  
 UNUSUAL SUPPORT FOR QUITTING SMOKING  
 LIFETIME DEAL SHORT-LIVED

   Market research figures released last week showed that Dell
Computer Corp. has pulled ahead of its archrival, Compaq Computer
Corp., in America's business computer market. Dell's 18.9 percent
share in the third quarter edged out Compaq's 18.4 percent. Though
that may look like a measly spread, it is huge for Dell, which has
been coming in second for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two companies have been battling for some time,'' said
Aaron Goldberg, executive vice president of Ziff-Davis Market
Intelligence, based in La Jolla, Calif. ``Every punch has always
met with a counterpunch.''
</P>
<P>
   In the consumer market, it is a different story. There, Goldberg
says, Compaq remains king. IDC, another market researcher, released
figures last week showing Compaq still holding a firm lead in the
overall market for personal computer shipments, with 15.8 percent
in the third quarter, compared with Dell's 14.1 percent. But in the
business sector, Dell's direct sales approach, along with its high
satisfaction rating, has found a niche with corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Dell and Compaq were not the only companies to swap places on
Goldberg's list. IBM, which had the third-largest share of the
nation's business computer market in the second quarter, fell to
fourth place in the third quarter, edged out by another direct
marketer, Gateway Inc.

   Motorola Organizes Cable Modem Conference
</P>
<P>
   If you thought the cable industry was confusing enough already,
hold on to your remotes. Sometime early next year, an assortment of
companies will start hawking data cable services and technology at
your local consumer electronics store, a move sure to stir things
up.
</P>
<P>
   To help move the process along _ and, presumably, to influence
its direction _ Motorola Inc., the current leader in cable modem
sales through cable companies, has invited just about everyone in
the industry to come chat it up at a first-of-its-kind conference
in Chicago next week. Called ``Retail Forum '98: Cable Modems Go
Retail,'' the industrywide gathering will include cable operators,
cable modem makers, retailers, computer companies and anybody else
who has a stake in high-speed data access. Featured speakers will
include Richard Sharp, chief executive of Circuit City Stores Inc.,
and Richard Borinstein, senior vice president of Radio Shack, a
unit of Tandy Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Cable modems are capable of transmitting data to home computers
at 50 to 100 times the rate of today's conventional modem
technology. Eventually, some analysts say, cable modems will be
ubiquitous and as cheap as modems today, someday even becoming a
standard item included in a home PC. But when the first cable
modems hit store shelves next year, they will be pricey, at
anywhere from $200 to $350.
</P>
<P>
   Cable modem makers like Motorola face a particular challenge as
they make the transition from selling only through cable companies
to selling to retail shoppers. Today, customers lease a cable modem
from their cable company, much as they would a cable transmitter,
and then pay roughly $40 a month for data services.
</P>
<P>
   Although Motorola has a huge lead today in sales through cable
companies, the competition is already fierce, with the likes of
Northern Telecom Ltd., 3Com Corp. and others set to enter the
retail market shortly. Dick Day, a corporate vice president and
general manager in Motorola's Multimedia group, insisted that
Motorola called the meeting not to promote its own agenda but to
insure that the nascent market gets off the ground without any
hitches.

   Cigarette Maker Gives Web Lesson in Quitting
</P>
<P>
   It's not often that a tobacco company tries to teach people how
to quit smoking. Still, Brown &AMP; Williamson, a unit of British
American Tobacco PLC, which makes Kool cigarettes and other brands,
has a section called ``Quitting Smoking'' on its Web site
(www.brownandwilliamson.com) alongside information on matters like
organizing your community to prevent smoking bans.
</P>
<P>
   The item went on the Web in May, and has received 150 to 200
visitors a month, the company said. ``We wanted to help people who
want to quit,'' said Sharon Boyse, director of scientific
communications at Brown &AMP; Williamson. ``That may sound unlikely,
but no manufacturer wants people to be in the position of using the
product if they don't want to.''
</P>
<P>
   The information, which Ms. Boyse said was culled from other Web
sites, including the American Cancer Society's, as well as academic
studies, notes that readers may have been ``persuaded by the media
that you're now an addict and that therefore, quitting is
impossible.'' It points out that 45 million people have quit. It
lists techniques, from drugs to hypnosis, that may be helpful,
adding, ``Many failures are the result of a less-than-100-percent
commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   But one expert said he found the information troubling. ``They
are mixing up a concept known as self-efficacy with the statement
that you need to be totally, 100 percent committed and convinced
you can do this,'' said Dr. Michael Fiore, director of the Center
for Tobacco Research and Intervention at the University of
Wisconsin's medical school. ``And the reality is that most American
smokers lack such confidence.'' Of the millions of smokers who try
to quit every year, he said, only 5 percent succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Fiore led the government panel that held hearings and issued
guidelines on the most effective means of quitting smoking. He said
he was also concerned about the Web site's discussion of smoking as
a habit, not an addiction. ``Everyone other than the tobacco
industry,'' he said, ``has recognized that this is a powerfully
addictive drug.''

   Lifetime Internet Access Faces Premature End
</P>
<P>
   Just how long is a lifetime on the Internet? About 21 months, if
you ask Bigger.net. In early 1997, the San Jose, Calif., Internet
service provider promised unlimited lifetime Internet access for a
one-time fee of $59, plus another $10 for a lifetime e-mail
account. Nearly 20,000 people believed it, hoping to rid themselves
forever of those pesky $19.95-a-month access fees.
</P>
<P>
   But as it turns out, the company did not have the technology, or
the management, to succeed. Last week, company executives filed for
bankruptcy. But at the last minute, a buyer appeared:
Brigadoon.com, an Internet service provider in Bellevue, Wash.,
paid an undisclosed sum for the company's assets.

ANTITRUST CASE IS HIGHLIGHTING ROLE OF E-MAIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (lb) 
 By STEVE LOHR   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The outcome of the Microsoft antitrust case may be a long way
off, but one thing is already clear: This is the first major e-mail
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The government's prosecution and Microsoft Corp.'s defense, to a
striking degree, are legal campaigns waged with electronic
messages. The human testimony often pales next to the e-mail
evidence. On the stand or in videotaped testimony, the people being
questioned shrug, mumble and forget. The e-mail is alive with ideas
and competitive zeal, punctuated with profanity and exclamation
points.
</P>
<P>
   The second week of the trial ended with the prosecutors being
frustrated because a lengthy cross-examination by Microsoft's lead
lawyer left no time for the government to show several hours of a
videotaped deposition of Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman. With a
new witness, an executive of Apple Computer Inc., taking the stand
Monday, it is uncertain when the Gates tape will be played.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and the 20 states suing Microsoft believe
that the tape will strengthen their case because it shows Gates
saying he was not involved in plans to take what the government
alleges were illegal steps to stifle competition in the Internet
software market. The Gates videotape, said David Boies, the Justice
Department's trial lawyer, offers an ``opportunity to judge Gates'
credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Gates credibility gap, if there is one, becomes an issue
not because of the videotape but because his taped remarks can be
compared and contrasted with the e-mail he wrote and received. The
e-mail record, the government insists, shows Gates waist-deep in
plotting the anti-competitive deals and bullying tactics that he
denies or professes to have never heard of in his taped deposition.
</P>
<P>
   If his machinations are central to the government's case, why
not summon Gates to the trial? ``The government does not need to
put Gates on the stand, because we have his e-mail and memoranda,''
Stephen Houck, a lawyer for the states, told the court.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft legal team has for months been preparing its
e-mail defense. First, Microsoft argues, anything that looks
damaging is taken out of context. ``I urge your honor,'' John
Warden, Microsoft's lead lawyer, told Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson, ``to view with considerable skepticism the crazy quilt of
e-mail fragments that seem to form the core of the government's
case.''
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft has also mounted an e-mail counterattack, culled
from the millions of messages it obtained by subpoena from
competitors in pretrial discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Warden's cross-examination ritual is to present a government
witness with an internal e-mail from his company and then pose a
declaration as a question. These interrogations have two refrains:
Isn't it true your company does exactly what you are accusing
Microsoft of doing, and isn't it true that Microsoft prevailed not
because it is a predatory monopolist but because of its superior
technology?
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is accused of trying to prod companies to stay out of
its way. So last week, for example, Warden produced e-mail from
Stephen Case, the chairman of America Online, suggesting a
partnership with Netscape Communications Corp. in which both
companies would focus on their respective strengths.
</P>
<P>
   That division of labor, Case wrote, would be the best way to
achieve the goal that Marc Andreessen, Netscape's cofounder,
described in an earlier e-mail as beating ``the Beast From Redmond
that wants to see us both dead'' _ a reference to Microsoft's
headquarters in Redmond, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Printouts of e-mail are just another form of written
communication. By the 1920s, as typewriters became common, typed
memoranda started to be used in court cases. From the 1950s through
the 1980s, legal experts say, there was an explosion of
documentation fueled by the new technologies of electric
typewriters, photocopying and fax machines, and then personal
computers.
</P>
<P>
   And e-mail, they add, has played an important role in legal
inquiries for years, like the Iran-contra case in the 1980s when
e-mail found in Oliver North's computer proved crucial.
</P>
<P>
   But the Microsoft case is the result of a sweeping government
antitrust investigation of a high-technology company where e-mail
has supplanted the telephone as the most common instrument of
communication. ``E-mail has just revolutionized investigations of
this kind,'' one senior Justice Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   While under investigation, Microsoft has handed over to the
government an estimated 30 million documents, mostly e-mail. In the
trial, the two sides have submitted about 3,000 exhibits, mainly
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   And in their e-mail, people often communicate more frankly and
informally than when writing a letter or a report _ tap it out,
punch a button and it's gone into cyberspace. But e-mail
communication is documentary evidence, which in legal cases
provides a rich, contemporaneous record of what people were
thinking and planning at the time.
</P>
<P>
   It can be a sharp contrast to formal oral testimony, so often
coached by lawyers and crafted by selective memory. ``The e-mail
record certainly makes the I-don't-recall line of response harder
to sustain,'' said Robert Litan, a former senior official in the
Justice Department's antitrust division who is now at the Brookings
Institution.
</P>
<P>
   It can also be powerful ammunition for pointing to
contradictions in testimony. And that is what the government will
do in attacking Gates' credibility with his videotaped deposition,
taken over three days in August.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The government offered a glimpse of that strategy on the first
day of the trial. It showed a few brief clips of a point in the
deposition when Gates was asked about a meeting on June 21, 1995,
at which, the government alleges, Microsoft offered to divide the
browser market with Netscape and to make an investment in the
company, which is its chief rival in that market.
</P>
<P>
   In the taped deposition, Gates says he recalled being asked by
one of his subordinates whether he thought it made sense to invest
in Netscape. He said that he was asked about it after the June 1995
meeting and replied, ``I didn't see that as something that made
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   But in an e-mail on May 31, 1995, Gates urged an alliance with
Netscape. ``We could even pay them money as part of the deal,'' he
wrote, ``buying a piece of them or something.''
</P>
<P>
   The contradiction between Gates' deposition and his e-mail,
though, does not of itself speak to the issue of whether Microsoft
made an illegal offer to Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, it is what Microsoft did _ not what it said in
e-mail communications _ that counts most. ``But once the e-mail
that looks bad gets in the record, you end up doing what
Microsoft's lawyers are going to spend much of this trial doing _
trying to explain it away,'' said Stephen Axinn, a leading
antitrust litigator with the firm Axinn, Veltrop &AMP; Harkrider in New
York.

SPORTSJONES JUST WON'T QUIT
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News   When University of
Iowa grad Royce Webb and his buddies decided they were tired of the
mainstream sports journalism and wanted to start their own on-line
site called SportsJones (http://www.sportsjones.com), they wrote
and posted a mission statement that included the following:
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We want you to join us as we take sports back from the
loudmouthed, cynical, corporate sports media. We're tired of
letting the media tell the same stories they've told 6,000 times
before, give meaningless stats and offer flash over substance.
We're sick of letting the media giants hound and tear down athletes
and sports in general. We deserve better.''
</P>
<P>
   So has the 33-year-old from Nashville backed it up?
</P>
<P>
   Updated several times daily since its June launch, SportsJones
has kept alive its fresh, alternative slant on sports issues
without sounding too high-falootin' to the common schlub who
probably doesn't get it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Webb's Web labor of love isn't just an outlet to rant like some
drooling cybergeek sports fan who just needs to see his opinions in
print; it's a site with substance, with depth and, as he described
in an interview with Online Journalism Review, a leader in the
``shift toward a more sensitive, progressive, humane perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, a currently posted SportsJones ``exclusive''
detailing how Kenneth Starr's investigation of President Clinton
has spread to activities of New York Yankees coach Don ``The
Gerbil'' Zimmer and his questionable relationship with former
Yankees pitcher Kenny Rodgers is more of the kind of stuff you'd
read in the on-again, off-again Spy magazine if it were all about
sports.
</P>
<P>
   So is the weekly NFL-picks section by Diane Chambers (the
barkeep from ``Cheers,'') whose system of mascot-vs.-mascot makes
as much sense as any.
</P>
<P>
   Some readers will see through it as sharp-witted parody. Others
will simply be baffled. This isn't meant for the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the more hard-edged stuff, the commentaries on why the
Mets backed down and signed Mike Piazza. This is what newspapers
should have.
</P>
<P>
   The best part of SportsJones (for now) is it doesn't have
advertising, making it the HBO of its kind in a world of CBS, NBC,
ABC and Fox. Publications without advertising support, obviously,
rarely survive. So take SportsJones and savor it for as long as
Webb and his pals can go without eating for another week.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Language tutor CDs lose a lot in translation
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Surely all of us, at one time or another, have wondered how it
would be to have our consciousness transplanted into that of
another, to see and understand from the viewpoint of someone else.
</P>
<P>
   My encounters with software conceived and whelped in France lead
me to believe that entering the mind of a Gallic software designer
would be like walking into a carnival funhouse for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   What got me into this train of thought is a product called Tell
Me More from Auralog, which is at once the most creative and the
most useless language tutor I have ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Tell Me More is a voice-recognition program that comes in
several languages; I looked at the Spanish version. It comes with
the mandatory headset (microphone and earphones), a couple of
manuals which are of only occasional help, and three CD-ROMs.
</P>
<P>
   The program provides almost every approach to language
comprehension you can imagine. The main screen is a scene full of
hotspots (remember Microsoft Bob?) leading you to to these various
approaches. Click on the notebook and you get the exercises. Among
the possible exercises are word associations, word order, filling
in the blanks in sentences, Hangman, a chance to take dictation,
associating words with pictures, and a crossword.
</P>
<P>
   All these are in Spanish. In other words, in filling in the
blanks, you get a sentence in Spanish and a set of words in
Spanish, from which you must choose the proper word to complete the
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Kinda tough if you don't know Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you go to the glossary and the grammar book. The
glossary is straightfoward and useful; it gives you a translation
of a Spanish word and a pronunciation of it. The grammar book, on
the other hand, is useless. For example, it attempts to demonstrate
the proper use of the word ``esta'' by using it in a series of
sentences _ none of which is translated.
</P>
<P>
   For further frustration, you can click on dialogue, which takes
you to a picture and a set of sentences. Another sentence is spoken
to you. You are supposed to select and utter the proper response.
</P>
<P>
   In some of these sections you can right-click on a word and get
some options such as a translation or pronunciation. The procedure
is, however, slow and cumbersome.
</P>
<P>
   What is utterly lacking in Tell Me More is any kind of cohesion
and direction. There is no step-by-step plan for learning, no sense
of ``Do this lesson and it will prepare you for that one.'' You
apparently are expected simply to jump off into the deep end and
sink or swim.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't know a good many Spanish words already, you'd
better take a life preserver with you.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear to me _ si, claro _ the French do not think the same
way I do. At least not the folks at 12 avenue Jean Bart, in Voisins
le Bretonneux.
</P>
<P>
   While we are on the subject of voice recognition, I took a look
at IBM's latest version, ViaVoice Executive 98. It terms of its
breadth, it is much improved. But in the critical area _ how well
it recognized my voice _ I can see no significant improvement. Once
again, I must conclude the time of the voice-recognition program
has not yet arrived.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Magazine provides sneak preview of 'Quake' update
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Parents don't much care for it, but that hasn't stopped
``Quake'' from being a hit with male children of all ages. Now the
third version of the gory shoot-'em-up is set for release, and the
November issue of PC Gamer has a sneak preview. The preview
includes 13 pages of inside information and screen shots from the
game. This version of ``Quake'' promises to be controversial.
Publisher id Software decided to try something new and focus on
just the DeathMatch part of the game. This version also will
emphasize multiplayer gaming over the Internet, says the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Online is going Hollywood. ``You've Got Mail,'' a new film
starring Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, is about a couple that romance

   In this time of financial turmoil, it's more important than ever
to investigate stocks before buying. That's especially true of
initial public offerings, or IPOs, which were among the hottest
sectors of the market until lately. There's no better place to
research an IPO than on the Net. Begin your research at Hoover's
IPO Central, a site dedicated to in-depth research of companies
going public. It holds, for example, thousands of profiles of IPO
companies, both past and present. There's also a primer on how to
judge an IPO. You'll find the site at http://www.ipocentral.com.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    New battery packs refillable
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A cellular phone without a battery is like a doughnut
without its hole. Maybe that's overstating things a bit, but
batteries are crucial.
</P>
<P>
   In the name of making batteries that last longer, Duracell
recently rolled out its Ultra line of refillable alkaline battery
packs.
</P>
<P>
   The new packs use AA- and AAA-size batteries. The packs are
billed as having 50 percent more life than standard alkaline
batteries. For cellular phones, that means more than 100 more
minutes of talking time, or up to 50 more two-minute phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   The batteries fit more than 60 percent of the phones on the
market, including Motorola's StarTAC and MicroTAC series, the Nokia
918 and 2100 series, the Qualcomm QCP820 series, and the Ericsson
200 and 300 series.
</P>
<P>
   The packs also can be used in digital and flash cameras,
minidisc players and
</P>
<P>
   camcorders.
</P>
<P>
   The packs, which retail for about $20, eliminate the need for a
charger or car adapter. They are on sale in stores where batteries
are usually sold.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrating the cheesy
</P>
<P>
   If your taste in movies runs similar to your taste in pizza,
there's a new Web site for you: http://www.b-movie.com celebrates
``the art and the industry'' of low-budget, cheesy B-movies.
</P>
<P>
   This month, the site is kicking off its first round of
inductions into its B-Movie Hall of Fame. Honorees were selected
from more than 1,000 nominations submitted by movie fans from
around the world. Participants selected their favorite films and
actors.
</P>
<P>
   Nominated B-movie actors include: The Bowery Boys, Bela Lugosi,
Ronald Reagan, Nancy Davis and John Waters.
</P>
<P>
   Nominated B-Movies include: ``Blood of Jesus,'' ``Death Race
2000,'' ``The Leopard Man'' and ``The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.''
</P>
<P>
   Voicing your opinion
</P>
<P>
   If you're the type who likes to voice your opinion on anything
and everything, but your friends and neighbors already have heard
it all, there's a Web site that might be your online haven.
</P>
<P>
   The site, http://www.sundbergf.com, is from SundbergFerar, a
Michigan-based firm that asks people their likes and dislikes about
the products they buy.
</P>
<P>
   This month's question: What do you think of your cordless drill?
</P>
<P>
   The information gathered is used to educate companies about how
their stuff is received. People who post responses have the option
of checking a box that ensures the name and information won't be
given to anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get consumers to realize their voice is really
important in the product process,'' said spokesman Mark Powers.
``Without the input, some companies are really missing the mark.''
</P>
<P>
   Combination deal
</P>
<P>
   Sony is pushing its minidisc hard this holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   The MD Bundle 5 combines the minidisc home recorder with a
portable minidisc player and a home minidisc player _ all for $350.
</P>
<P>
   The bundled package is designed to bring first-time users to the
minidisc way of thinking. The package features an MDS-JE320 home
recording deck, an MZ-E40 portable MD player and two 60-minute
MDW-60A recordable minidiscs. The MDS-JE320 home deck offers Wide
Bit Stream technology, which is designed to reproduce soft,
low-level music. A separate jog dial for text entry and track
selection is available for an estimated retail price of $199.
</P>
<P>
   The portable part of the package is a machine that weighs 10.6
ounces, including the headphone and batteries, and can fit in your
pocket. It takes two AA batteries, which provide four hours of
power. The machine also features a 10-second memory to make sure
any bumps or jolts don't interrupt the listening pleasure. The
totable unit's LCD readout lists battery life, track title, track
number and play mode. The minidisc format lets you add, erase, move
and mix tracks at the push of a button. According to Sony, the
minidiscs themselves can be re-recorded more than a million times,
with no loss of sound quality.
</P>
<P>
   Sony gives you three extra recordable minidiscs (a $15 value)
with each purchase of a minidisc player or recorder.
</P>
<P>
   Small-cap investors' site
</P>
<P>
   Next Wave Stocks, an online magazine designed for the investor
interested in small-cap stocks (companies with market
capitalization of less than $500 million), has started a Web site
for small-cap investors.
</P>
<P>
   The site, at http://www.nextwavestocks.com, bills itself as the
only barometer for small-cap technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Small-cap stocks took some of the biggest hits during the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Next Wave 100 composite index dropped 28.4 percent during
that time. The index of small-cap companies is made up of
information technology companies, technology manufacturing and
biotech.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Once you add the necessities, G3 is a better buy than iMac
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ No question about it. The iMac is one sharp-looking
computer. But is it a good buy? I'd argue not. A better investment
would be any of Apple Computer's G3 desktop models.
</P>
<P>
   Now, before you start flaming me with e-mail charges of
betrayal, let me explain. I consider the iMac a good, if not great,
computer. It works reasonably well, has a brilliantly sharp screen
and, of course, there's that striking bondi translucent body.
</P>
<P>
   But a computer is a lot more than looks. It needs to work out of
the box with existing software and devices like printers. It is
here the iMac falls short. In addition, the iMac really costs more
than its listed price. Here's why:
</P>
<P>
   For starters, there's no internal floppy drive. Apple Computer's
Steve Jobs doesn't think you need or want one. But I doubt few of
you can get by without a floppy drive. How better to save and carry
all those little files you create day in and out?
</P>
<P>
   That means you'll have to buy a floppy, and there's only one
available that works with the iMac. It's called the Imation
SuperDisk and sells for about $150. Adding an Imation drive raises
the price of the iMac to $1,450.
</P>
<P>
   And there's more
</P>
<P>
   That's still a good price _ but wait, you're not done yet. The
iMac's 32 megabytes of internal memory, or RAM, is inadequate to
run most of today's multimedia games, supposedly one of this
computer's strengths. You'll need to at least double the iMac's
RAM, which adds another $100 to $200 to the price.
</P>
<P>
   Don't close your wallet yet, especially if you'd like to print
anything from the iMac. It uses a new standard for connecting
peripheral devices, and your old printer won't work. That means you
either have to buy a new printer, for $270, or a special device
that will connect the iMac to old printers. Those devices range in
price from $40 to $100.
</P>
<P>
   In total, the iMac is not as inexpensive as Apple Computer would
have you believe. Its true price runs between $1,700 and $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   For that, you might as well buy a G3 desktop or PowerBook. Both
of them cost about the same and come with everything you need right
out of the box.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    It's time to start over with a lean, mean Net browser
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Not too many years ago, a good friend gave me one of
those fancy Swiss Army knives. It was a marvel (probably still is,
but it's lost in the clutter now, or perhaps has escaped back to
Switzerland).
</P>
<P>
   It contained a magnifying glass, two different kinds of
screwdrivers, a small saw, three or four knife blades, a fingernail
clipper, scissors, a hole punch and even a toothpick. All of them
worked, after a fashion, and none of them worked very well. If you
really needed a screwdriver or scissors, it was nothing like having
the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Every time I download a new version of Netscape Communicator or
Microsoft Internet Explorer _ the two most popular programs for
browsing the World Wide Web _ I think of that knife. The
competition has gotten so heated between the two Web browsers that
each tries hard to outdo the other by loading in new features.
There are so many I truly can't remember what all of them do. And
since I don't use them, I never get reminded.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, I can zip through the menus of Netscape Communicator and
find a way to design a Web page from scratch, or read postings in
the newsgroups, or send e-mail, join a chat group on the Net or
fire up AOL's Instant Messager to locate a friend online and send a
message. It's the same with Internet Explorer. Each time one
browser adds a new feature, the other duplicates that feature and
adds two additional ones.
</P>
<P>
   But all I want to do is browse the Web. That, after all, is why
I have the Web browser in the first place. When I want to send
e-mail, I use a program made to do that (in my case, Eudora Pro)
much better than a Web browser. When I want to browse the
newsgroups, I fire up NewsXpress. Dedicated programs truly do a
better job than a Swiss Army knife program.
</P>
<P>
   At first, all this feature-packing seems harmless. After all, in
the screwy world of Internet commerce, both Microsoft and Netscape
give these products away. You can download either program
(Netscape: http://home.netscape.com or Explorer:
http://www.microsoft.com) directly from the Internet without paying
a cent.
</P>
<P>
   But when you do, you'll find out one of the many reasons I wish
these companies would get out of the Swiss Army knife business and
back into the honorable business of creating a way to browse the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I'm spoiled by the high-speed T1 data line I use at work
when connecting to the Internet. It's like driving on the Autobahn
on a day when the traffic is light. But when I get home and use my
56k bps analog modem and the telephone lines, downloads crawl. And
both Internet Explorer and Netscape are huge. To give you a notion,
the full version of Netscape Communicator is more than 14
megabytes. That's bigger than the first hard drive I owned, back in
the dark ages.
</P>
<P>
   Since you fight both relatively slow download speeds and heavy
traffic at these sites, the download often gets painfully slow,
with speeds dipping well below the rated speed of most modems. I've
literally seen downloads that took hours.
</P>
<P>
   And if your Internet connection is at all shaky, you could have
the painful experience of waiting an hour or so for the download to
finish and _ at the last minute _ losing the connection. You have
to start all over again.
</P>
<P>
   That's what I wish Microsoft and Netscape would do. Start all
over again and build a browser that is lean and mean.

SPECIALISTS WORRY ABOUT THE COMPLEXITIES OF HIGH-TECH TOYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN   c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Erik Strommen, a designer for Microsoft, looked delighted as he
demonstrated his company's Interactive Arthur doll. Gently squeeze
the arm, foot, or ear of this cuddly $99 computerized character,
and it converses with its holder; add a device for another $60 and
it communicates with an Internet Web site, so it can be used for
playing and learning simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of toy is going to complicate children's worlds in
lots of interesting ways,'' Strommen said proudly.
</P>
<P>
   But some child psychologists, researchers, and academics are
worried about what those ``interesting ways'' may include. While
they think toys like Arthur have positive aspects, they point out
that there's no way to shut them off, so kids can't do things they
instinctively love to do with dolls _ like cuddle with them while
falling asleep.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, a growing number of specialists in childhood
development worry that high-tech toys, games, and Web sites _
including ones intended principally for education _ are
proliferating at such stunning speed that no one knows what effects
they could ultimately have on users. The specialists also complain
that the studies being done are overwhelmingly instigated by
industries with a vested interest in their outcomes, rather than by
governments or educational institutions whose sole objective would
be to examine the developmental repercussions for children.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers worry that _ like television _ the nascent,
computer-based media might grow and thrive without systematic
attempts to shape or steer them in ways beneficial to their
youngest users. Already, they say, these media are proliferating
without basic knowledge about how long children should use them,
whether they get in the way of forming friendships, and what
effects various games _ especially violent ones _ have on behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The technical innovations are moving more quickly than the
market can keep up with, and certainly more quickly than the family
can keep up with,'' said Sheri Parks, who is conducting research at
the University of Maryland on children's use of so-called new
media. ``And therein lies the rub.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Turkle, a sociology professor at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and one of the only psychologists in the
world specializing in computer culture, lamented that more
researchers aren't moving into her field, particularly since the
most significant changes in the ways children use new technologies
have occurred in this decade.
</P>
<P>
   When she began studying the subject 20 years ago, Turkle said,
children saw computers as ``evocative objects'' that they could
``think with.'' Today children essentially perceive computers as
``sort-of alive'' with thoughts and feelings, said Turkle, who
called computers an ``incredibly psychological technology.''
</P>
<P>
   She and others said this metamorphosis has potentially major
reprecussions for children's learning techniques, views of life and
emotions, and an array of other issues.
</P>
<P>
   They say that without guidance for both the creators of new
technology and the parents who buy it, market-driven research could
become the only determining factor in what products become popular,
or even available. Indeed, so little research has been conducted
that no consensus has developed on questions as basic as whether
computers can be ``seductive,'' in a negative way akin to being
mesmerized by television, or are inherently positive because of
their interactive nature.
</P>
<P>
   Prestigious firms like Microsoft, along with ones that
specialize in educational toys and software, insist that they take
their responsibility to children seriously. They explain, for
instance, that they use psychologists and focus groups to determine
the appropriateness of products before releasing them.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, these companies generally agree that most
destinations on the Internet, as well as many items on store
shelves, don't receive such scrutiny before they're launched _ and
few, if any, are the subjects of serious research into their
long-term effects on psychology, behavior, or socialization.
</P>
<P>
   The torrent of interactive games and sites with lurid or violent
content are subjects of particular concern, as is the blurring of
lines between information and advertising on the Internet. But even
such seemingly innocuous activities as participating in on-line
chat rooms raise questions in the minds of many specialists, who
wonder whether the computerized conversations may impede children
from learning social and verbal skills that have always been honed
through contact with their peers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Uncharted territory &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the enormous impact that everyone agrees these
technologies will have on our children's lives ... isn't it amazing
that there's no groundwork, no real basis for our assumptions, no
real knowledge base for what their impact's going to be?'' asked
Kathryn Montgomery, president of the Center for Media Education in
Washington, D.C. ``Studying the impact of these emerging media on
our children just isn't a field yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Which doesn't mean there's no research being done. A wide array
of tests are being conducted in venues as diverse as college
education departments nationwide, some of which accept corporate
backing and some of which don't; the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology's vaunted Media Lab, which has numerous marketplace
tie-ins; and the Children's Television Workshop, which produces
shows like ``Sesame Street'' and is collaborating on experimental,
on-line projects with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Few children's psychologists or other behavioral specialists are
doing in-depth work on this subject, though, and those who are have
not linked their efforts or attempted to form a database for use by
fellow researchers or parents. Moreover, specialists point out that
neither the federal government, large philanthropic organizations,
nor major scientific groups have weighed in with ongoing resources
or money.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Media Education and the Communications Department
of the University of Texas at Austin recently sponsored a
conference in Washington in an effort to connect diverse research
projects, stimulate broader ones, and develop strategies for
convincing national politicians and funding groups that there is a
problem that needs to be addressed. The attendees included some of
America's most prominent psychologists, educators, scientists,
researchers, and industry representatives who deal with children
and computers.
</P>
<P>
   Strikingly, there was little disagreement among the diverse
participants, regardless of their backgrounds or areas of
expertise. Some who came from the profit sector defended their work
against complaints that they aren't sufficiently focused on
children's developmental needs, but no one spoke against the idea
of more targeted, coordinated research, especially into long-term
consequences for children.
</P>
<P>
   Many participants expressed confidence that major players in the
marketplace would try to take children's needs into account on
their own, partly because business schools today stress ethics and
social responsibility more than they did in the past. At the same
time, they provided examples of games with gruesome and violent
content, and decried the lack of research to determine their
effects on users.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Computers are childhood staple &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the experts agreed that children are growing so
reliant on computers for education and recreation _ a trend that is
certain to accelerate _ that parents and teachers shouldn't rely on
the good intentions of the business world.
</P>

   Idit Harel, an alumna of Harvard's Graduate School of Education
and the MIT Media Lab, said many children born in the 1990s, in
particular, are being raised with computers as an integral part of
their lives rather than as an adjunct that they must learn to
master.
</P>
<P>
   ``For them, computers are the fifth food group,'' said Harel,
the founder of MaMaMedia Inc., one of scores of companies
nationwide that devise and market educational products for the new
media.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must determine, while this technology is still in its
infancy, what its effects are and where we should be going with
it,'' added Joanne Cantor, the author of ``Mommy, I'm Scared'' and
a University of Wisconsin communications professor who has long
studied the effects of movies and television on children.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all,'' she said, ``emotions are never checked at the
door when you interact with anything, including a computer.''

`THE SIEGE': NEW YORK AS BATTLEGROUND OF TERRORISTS AND TROOPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at the end of review.) 
(js) 
 By JANET MASLIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Attention, class: Would it be a good thing to see
U.S. Army troops marching over the Brooklyn Bridge? Should we
imprison those of foreign descent if they have putative links to
terrorism? In the event of martial law, would anyone want Bruce
Willis to be in charge? And if there were, quite literally, a bomb
in a Broadway theater, wouldn't it be sporting to let us see what
was on the marquee?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Siege'' provides the easiest of answers to all but the
last question (the name of the play is tactfully shrouded in
post-explosion haze) as it turns into a speechifying consideration
of civil liberties and constitutional rights. Too bad, because
Edward Zwick's ultimately sedate thriller starts out with crisply
efficient style and the potential for a much more involving story.
Incorporating a sense of real news and real peril, it begins with
the surreptitious capture of a suspected Arab terrorist, Sheik
Ahmed Bin Talal, and envisions the activities of US-based disciples
who seek his release. Among the film's most ominous shots is one
panning from a New York mosque to the Manhattan skyline, which
looks like one big tempting target in the context of this story.
</P>
<P>
   Presiding over the film's first few terrorist attacks, which are
menacingly staged, is Denzel Washington as the take-charge FBI man
Anthony (Hub) Hubbard. Lines like ``Put him in play!'' and ``Pin a
tail on her!'' and ``All right, let's roll!'' establish Hub as the
authoritative type, as does his way of sipping coffee from an FBI
mug while striding down the hall. Washington excels at bringing
teasing charm to such officious types, but Hub isn't given much
chance to develop into an interesting character. Once the film gets
a few shocking explosions under its belt (like that Broadway
attack, where ``the list of victims is a veritable Who's Who of the
city's cultural leaders''), it simmers down into an internecine cat
fight involving the military, the FBI and (with Annette Bening as
one brusque Mata Hari) the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   Caught up in the crossfire is New York's Arab-American
community, which has raised understandable objections to images
seen in ``The Siege.'' Though the screenplay (by Lawrence Wright,
Menno Meyjes and Zwick) is strenuously even-handed and even
incorporates a nice-guy, Beirut-born sidekick for Hub (played ably
by Tony Shalhoub), the film's stark images of scheming Arab
villains often speak louder than its diplomatic words. Bending over
especially far backward, the film gives Ms. Bening's tough cookie a
complex relationship to the Arabs in her past, with lines like:
``My first boyfriend was Palestinian. You know, my father used to
say they seduce you with their suffering.'' When, late in the film,
Arab-Americans are put in internment camps, there is the obligatory
cry: ``What if it was black people? Huh? What if it was Italians?
Puerto Ricans?''
</P>
<P>
   Well-intentioned words don't change either the film's visual
demonizing of Arab characters or its way of titillating the
audience with terrorist stunts. As Ms. Bening's worldly character
points out, it's often the television cameras that matter most in
hostage takings. And here it's the movie cameras, lending a deadly
frisson of excitement to bombs in a schoolroom, on a city bus, at a
federal office building and in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Washington and Ms. Bening play smart, interesting characters who
never quite connect, while Willis turns himself into the loosest
military cannon this side of ``Dr. Strangelove.'' His arrogance is
nothing if not persuasive, but it should be remembered that Willis
hit his stride as an actor playing salt-of-the-earth Everyman
types, without the sneer.
</P>

`CROSSING FIELDS': REAL PEOPLE WITH REAL PROBLEMS IN A MIDWESTERN
PLACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at the end of review.) 
(js) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a good little movie playing at the resurrected Thalia
Theater. It has no dazzling special effects or big-name stars, but
James Rosenow's ``Crossing Fields'' has memorable characters in
provocative situations that revolve around marriage, infidelity,
sexism, parent-child relationships and race.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, sad and sexy, this engaging film is set among essentially
decent people living modest, mainstream lives in a superficially
placid, churchgoing Middle Western community. Its principal story
contrasts the life of Carol (Reedy Gibbs), a woman in her 40s in a
solid if unexciting marriage, with that of her best friend, Jessica
(Gwynyth Walsh), a storm-tossed woman who responds to her husband's
affair by sleeping with, figuratively, half the men in town.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to this story, Rosenow, a New York University film
school graduate who is the writer, producer and director of this
well-acted first feature, provides a generous helping of others.
</P>
<P>
   While Carol's easygoing husband, Guy (J.K. Simmons) looks on,
Carol is in conflict with their daughter, Denise (Meadow Sisto),
who is fighting the idea of college and sneaking out of the house
at night to pursue her career as a rock musician.
</P>
<P>
   Into the lives of this family comes a boarder, James (William
James Jones), a handsome, muscular and altogether charming and
level-headed young black man who is seeking work and knowledge of
white society.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the comfortable beliefs Carol has lived by are shaken by
his presence and by Jessica's turmoil, compounded by a former
lover's threat to foreclose the mortgage on her family farm and the
prospect of resuming her marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenow handles his material and his cast with skill. Moviegoers
who look to shootouts, car crashes and explosions for stimulation
are advised to avoid ``Crossing Fields.'' Those who find
stimulation in intelligent issues, realistic characters and lively
storytelling are likely to find this film appealing.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION NOTES:

OUTLINES OF ENERGY DEFINE DE KOONING 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By HOLLAND COTTER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a nice piece of timing, three substantial gallery
exhibitions of drawings by Willem de Kooning _ at the Drawing
Center in Soho, Matthew Marks in Chelsea and Mitchell-Innes &AMP; Nash
on Madison Avenue _ have coincided with the enthralling Jackson
Pollock retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   The two men were friends and peers, but are very different
artists. Pollock, deeply and irrevocably mythologized, has taken on
the aura of an E.T. who briefly streaked in from another universe
and out again.
</P>
<P>
   The tirelessly productive de Kooning (1904-97) had both feet on
earth, and that's where the clamorous, humming energy of his
painting seems to come from.
</P>
<P>
   The same energy is evident in his drawings. The three shows (two
of which also include sculptures) don't pretend to add up to a
survey; they include nothing at all from the pivotal 1940s or early
50s. But the later work that they do have is protean stuff. It
includes high-spirited warm-ups for paintings, ultra-refined
finished pieces and all manner of glorified doodles, which together
illuminate a career.
</P>
<P>
   In shaping that career, de Kooning found ways to reign in his
natural facility as a draftsman in order to sharpen his pictorial
game. Some of those strategies can be seen in the four series in
the Drawing Center exhibition, organized by Klaus Kertess.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest pieces, dated 1958, are studio exercises of the
``write a sonnet about that chair'' variety, self-assigned tasks
set to keep the mind and eye alert. Titled ``Folded Shirt on
Laundry Paper,'' they are what they say they are: quick
ink-and-brush sketches of shirts.
</P>
<P>
   In de Kooning's hands, the results are almost absurdly
virtuosic, a witty, effortless dance between abstraction and
depiction. On the one hand, the shirts are distilled to
pictographs; on the other, they assume anatomical life as stout
upright phalluses or rectangular torsos topped by with plump
breasts.
</P>
<P>
   The human body, particularly the female body, was at the center
of almost everything he did. And it is the subject of a group of
charcoal drawings from 1966, all of which he executed with his eyes
closed, a Surrealist technique designed to tickle the subconscious
into action. (He also cooked up his own variation on this device,
which involved drawing with his left hand while watching
television.)
</P>
<P>
   In this period he was painting hot-pink nudes: Rubensian
good-time girls whose robust bodies ripple and blur as if reflected
in water. But the figures in the drawings are their opposites:
stooped hags with long arms, spindly legs and haunted eyes. Any
attempts to figure out de Kooning's ``real'' attitude toward women
through his art (a vain endeavor, surely) must take both sets of
images into account.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the mid-60s, he returned to the male figure in a series
of Crucifixion drawings; some two dozen are in the show. Barnett
Newman was painting his ``Stations of the Cross'' then, and Mark
Rothko his murals for the de Menil chapel in Houston, so something
was in the air. But exactly what prompted de Kooning's drawings is
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the crucified figures are nudes, with prominent genitals
and outstretched arms, though they rarely assume the spread-eagle
pose of sexual availability routinely found in his images of women.
The bodies are often framed by the lines of the cross itself. The
faces are tangles of lines, and some have cartoonish features, with
a sharp nose and bulging, forlorn eyes.
</P>
<P>
   De Kooning riffed on this motif for years. A scratchy 1969
pencil drawing of the Crucifixion carries the hand-lettered title
``Charleston Pose'' and includes a demure woman with long eyelashes
and a kneeling or splayed figure with what appear to be Philip
Guston-eque hairy legs. And an oil and ink-wash series from 1972,
``For Santa Emilia: Six Tears for Six Saints,'' turns the crucified
figure into spare, androgynous icons.

   Kertess proposes that the crucified men are self-portraits. In
any case, their emotional ambiguity is of interest. Are they
intended to be tragically expressive or merely klutzy? Parodies of
suffering, emblems of the real thing, or both? Here, as usual, de
Kooning took pains to complicate his work enough to put it beyond
easy grasp.
</P>
<P>
   His complications were also formal, as suggested by the
large-scale charcoal and oil on vellum pieces that close the
Drawing Center show. They were created not as stand-alone works but
as means of tracing and transferring images from paintings he had
finished to others still in progress.
</P>
<P>
   This process was clearly intended to interrupt the smooth flow
of the act of painting, to keep art itself impure; de Kooning used
other methods to do the same thing, like collage and techniques
that combined newsprint and paint.
</P>
<P>
   Examples of work using newsprint are at Matthew Marks and
Mitchell-Innes &AMP; Nash. In one oil sketch done on a page from a 1977
copy of The New York Times, a snarling, bug-eyed painted face can
be read as a response to a grisly headline and as a hilarious
counterpart to two suave models in an advertisement, who themselves
look pretty freakish in the context.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the gallery shows has the thematic coherence of the
Drawing Center presentation, but they are full of good things and
make some astute points. An ink drawing of a head at Marks really
could be a candidate for a self-portrait. And an oil-and-gouache
figure of a woman at Mitchell-Innes &AMP; Nash, just a twist of flesh
pink and lipstick red, distills the tradition of Baroque
mythological painting that was in de Kooning's blood.
</P>
<P>
   Both shows make useful links between drawings and sculptures. At
Mitchell-Innes &AMP; Nash, a jittery ``Clamdigger'' sketch, circa 1972,
appears in the company of a plaster version of the sculpture of
that title, on loan from the Nasher Collection in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   (Two big de Kooning bronze sculptures, incidentally, are on
temporary outdoor view in the Manhattan, under the auspices of the
Public Art Fund, one at Doris C. Freedman Plaza, the other in
Bryant Park.)
</P>
<P>
   The Pollock retrospective at the Modern includes drawings along
with the paintings, a good idea. The major de Kooning exhibition at
the National Gallery in Washington in 1994 did not, and we're still
waiting for the show that will integrate such materials _ the inner
mechanics of a career, what makes it tick _ into a comprehensive
survey of his work.
</P>
<P>
   But then, de Kooning is an odd case in postwar art. He's so huge
_ in the senses of being both ambitious and prolix _ that he's
elusive; so monumental that he can almost be ignored. Contemporary
art history hasn't really begun to tackle him. Theory-minded
scholars, who find much to say about Pollock, so far seem little
attracted to de Kooning. And a lot of critical writing on him is
gushy, still in the adoring, star-struck stage.
</P>
<P>
   This will probably change as de Kooning, who was still hard at
work just over a decade ago, gradually moves out of the present and
into history. He has certainly left future historians plenty to
work with, and the drawings in these three shows add a provocative
dollop to that dauntingly generous mix.

JONI MITCHELL, IN CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
JONI MITCHELL: PAINTING WITH WORDS AND MUSIC 
On: Pay Per View, $19.95 
Time: Friday night, 9-11 p.m. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A perfectionist, Joni Mitchell has fared enormously well in the
studio, where she can carefully gauge each vocal locution, each
guitar tuning, each harmonic flourish. Her best albums, from
``Court and Spark,'' ``The Hissing of Summer Lawns,'' and ``Night
Ride Home'' to the finest, ``Hejira,'' are unequaled among pop
singer-songwriters for their instrumental precision and finely
measured phrasing.
</P>
<P>
   But throughout her long career, Mitchell has not been
particularly at ease performing live onstage. She has a reputation
for public crankiness, an inability to roll with the punches of
mediocre sound systems and the chaos of crowds who may not want to
sit absolutely still. Anyone who attended her 1983 concert on the
Boston Common will certainly recall her leaving early, noting, ``I
can't play to people milling around.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, on pay per view at 9 p.m., fans will have the
opportunity to see Mitchell perform live in circumstances that seem
close to her ideal. The invited audience, circled around Mitchell
and her band, are seated comfortably (and quietly) on couches and
stuffed chairs, and she is enclosed in a collection of monitors
that allow her to hear herself clearly. Also, her beloved paintings
hang both around the back of the soundstage and in a show set up in
an adjacent gallery. While the special has an infomercial aura at
points, not least of all when she is introduced as the ``wonderful,
beautiful, amusing, incredibly interesting, intellectual'' Joni
Mitchell, it is nonetheless a fully wonderful two hours of song
with moments of drama and warmth. The special leaves no doubt about
the durability of Mitchell's best material, the classy evolution of
her voice, and her ability to surround herself with superior
musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell starts out with an early hit, ``Big Yellow Taxi,'' but
most of the set list focuses on her more subtle work from the
mid-1970s and the 1990s. After a pair of shaky solo songs, she
brings out her band _ including her ``magnificent ex-husband,''
Larry Klein, on bass _ and the music warms up quickly. A
beautifully arranged ``Harry's House'' is driven by some dynamic
drumming by Brian Blade, ``Amelia'' is distinguished by Greg
Leisz's flying pedal steel guitar, and Klein riffs off the late
Jaco Pastorius's studio bass lines for a sweeping ``Hejira.''
</P>
<P>
   You can see Mitchell loosening up, shimmying at the microphone
and delivering a fierce version of ``Sex Kills,'' a heartbreaking
``Magdelene Laundries,'' and a melodic ``Face Lift'' from her new
album, ``Taming the Tiger.'' She jokes about her propensity for
writing morbid Christmas songs, and asks the audience for help with
the lyrics of the long ``Song for Sharon,'' which builds to a
rousing ``by and by'' conclusion. Mitchell seems most unguarded
late in the show, during a trio of songs she didn't write,
including her smoky interpretation of ``Trouble Man'' and a killer
version of ``Comes Love,'' for which she takes off her sandals. By
the end, behind the credits, she is cozily lounging in the empty
seats of the hall, cigarette in hand, singing ``Dreamland''
surrounded by her band.
</P>
<P>
   The only odd occurrence is a visit by Graham Nash, who presents
Mitchell with the Hall of Fame award he accepted for her last year,
when she chose not to attend the induction ceremony. Did Mitchell,
who has clearly mapped out the whole show, plan this ``surprise''
presentation, which Nash makes ``on behalf of Jann Wenner and the
people at the museum''? ``It's perfect in a garbage bag,'' she
quips coolly about the award's packaging. Then, after telling a
long story about an early encounter with the trap of celebrity, she
launches into a gorgeous version of ``Woodstock'' that renders the
question of accolades and honors quite trivial.

`VELVET GOLDMINE' A GRAND LOOK AT GLAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDY CORDOVA  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - England's glam-rock scene in the '70s produced a lot
of records that pulsed and throbbed with a tense, erotic energy.
</P>
<P>
   It also inspired Todd Haynes' colorfully surreal ``Velvet
Goldmine,'' which shares the sexual undercurrent and mind-bending
edge of the best music from that long-ago era.
</P>
<P>
   The film is a trippy fantasy focusing on a displaced British
reporter (a gaunt Christian Bale) assigned to uncover the
whereabouts of Brian Slade (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), a charismatic
glam king who disappeared from the music scene after staging his
own death.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds straightforward enough, but the film cleverly bobs and
weaves through time. In one scene, it's 1984 New York, as Bale
struggles with a difficult assignment editor. The next minute, it's
1974 London and Rhys Meyers is dealing with the vagaries of his
newfound fame.
</P>
<P>
   As Bale plunges deeper into the mystery, time and place
seamlessly intermingle. It turns out that Bale came to terms with
his budding sexuality through the gender-bending antics of Rhys
Meyers, who juggles a relationship with his wife (Toni Collette)
and a drug-addled rocker (Ewan McGregor).
</P>
<P>
   Like a rock-and-roll ``Citizen Kane,'' the puzzle gradually
unravels, revealing more about the introverted reporter and the
enigmatic Slade. No one is as they first appear, we soon learn, as
different layers of the characters are peeled back.
</P>
<P>
   Touches of magical realism abound in the movie. A mysterious
jewel links the film's protagonists, while a UFO flits in and out
of the picture at odd times.
</P>
<P>
   It's a dazzling, visceral treat that Haynes has crafted. He has
an obvious appreciation for the era, with its platformed boots and
glittery clothes. He's also quite fond of his actors, filming them
with a loving affection. The camera doesn't just drift across Rhys
Meyers' pouty, androgynous face; instead, it caresses it, with a
dreamy, soft-focus abandon.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes is perhaps best-known for ``Superstar: The Karen
Carpenter'' Story,'' a bizarre indie project that told the life of
the tragic singer through Barbie dolls. In a playful homage to that
film, one ``Goldmine'' scene features a pair of copulating dolls in
p lace of two of its leading men.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes' delicate attention to visual detail doesn't mean he
shortchanges his actors. He draws out superb, understated work from
his cast, particularly the volatile McGregor, who plays a character
named Curt Wild and physically resembles Kurt Cobain.
</P>
<P>
   Even the supporting roles are carefully drawn. Michael Feast
takes a small role as Slade's first agent and turns it into a quiet
marvel of regret and heartbreak.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the movie twists its way to its unpredictable
climax, viewers will be tangled in its darkly complex web. ``Velvet
Goldmine'' is truly compelling, in that it manages to evoke such
great rock films as Michael Apted's ``Stardust'' and Ken Russell's
``Tommy'' but still feel like something completely fresh and
original . In that way, it resembles the best of rock and roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Velvet Goldmine'' is rated R for nudity, sex and adult themes.
4 stars. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Five days before the curtain goes up on ``The Radio
City Christmas Spectacular'' and the theater already smells like a
barnyard. Ted the donkey, Nina the camel and other domesticated
stars of the show's ``Living Nativity'' scene are camped out in a
room just off stage right, and an odor common to rural environs is
wafting among the electricians, dancers and dwarfs who are
scurrying about for an impending dress rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   Red strobes flash, warning the company that a swath of Radio
City Music Hall's massive stage is about to drop 40 feet. Spangled
Rockettes nervously tap out their moves in the wings while a prop
master checks to make sure that the giant bow-tied gifts, plywood
reindeer and a cradle holding baby Jesus (it's just a doll) are
ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minutes of boredom separated by seconds of sheer terror,''
mutters Eric Titcomb, who operates the three stage elevators, a
revolving turntable and the Music Hall's legendary ``dancing
curtain,'' a three-ton bolt of fabric whose contours are shaped by
13 separate motors.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the crackling of walkie-talkies, the hurly-burly
backstage has changed little since 1933, when the theater
impresario S.L. (Roxy) Rothafel first staged this sequin-encrusted
Christmas pageant for a city numbed by the Depression. Since then _
notwithstanding a 1978 brush with extinction _ the ``Christmas
Spectacular'' has become one of the nation's most enduring
extravaganzas and, like yellow cabs and dirty-water hot dogs, an
unmistakable _ if slightly hokey _ New York City icon.
</P>
<P>
   There are now five ``Christmas Spectacular'' franchises across
the country and a Las Vegas company of Rockettes that high-kicks
year round. Cablevision, the entertainment giant that last year
bought both the show and the lease to the landmark Art Deco
theater, has ambitious plans to take the Rockette brand even
further.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason why we have to be limited by the Christmas
season,'' said Bruce Michael, the producer of the Rockettes, who
rents out the dancers for conventions, television commercials and
private parties.
</P>
<P>
   The show, once staged between Thanksgiving and Christmas, opens
Sunday night with cameos by Tony Bennett and Liza Minnelli. And
despite its early November debut, the ``Christmas Spectacular''
usually has no trouble filling the Music Hall's 5,901 seats for its
two-month run.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, more than 1.1 million people saw the New York
production, which brought in $49 million, up from $35.5 million
five years ago. Radio City executives say it now draws more people
in eight weeks than any Broadway show does in an entire year.
</P>
<P>
   How so? By running six back-to-back performances on weekends,
beginning as early as 9 a.m. and as late as 10 p.m., and
aggressively marketing the show, on milk cartons, automated teller
machine screens and at fast-food restaurants. This year there will
be 205 performances, seven more than last year, and, a first, five
Spanish-language productions.
</P>
<P>
   This breakneck schedule may make for enviable profits, but it is
brutal on the 250-member cast and crew. ``You have to become like a
machine,'' said Julie Harkness, a Rockette from Indianapolis who
has danced at Radio City for the last five years. ``I have to
strictly monitor what I eat, how much I sleep and even limit the
amount of time I talk on the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is hard to find anyone in the company who isn't
starry-eyed about the ``Christmas Spectacular,'' which, despite a
few updated numbers, remains a perky museum piece of vaudevillian
razzle-dazzle. Over the 90 minutes, the audience, half of it
children, is treated to a brief film of Santa landing on the roof
of Rockefeller Center (projected on the Music Hall's 80-foot-wide
screen), ice skaters gliding on plastic, a herd of live animals, 11
major scene changes and a half-dozen ``little people,'' as the
dwarfs who play Santa's elves are called.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockettes, those smiling, perfectly synchronized automatons,
appear in almost every scene and go through eight costume changes,
100 kicks and ``1,200 pairs of panty hose during their eight-week
run,'' boasts the production notes.
</P>
<P>
   Michael, who remembers his first stage show in 1954 as if it
were yesterday, compared the holiday pageant to a grandiose MGM
musical. ``There's nothing as lush, as lavish or as breathtaking as
the `Christmas Spectacular,''' said Michael, who started working
for Radio City as stage manager in 1971, fresh out of college. ``In
a sense, we're preserving a vanished species.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the show was spiffed up four years ago by Robert
Longbottom, the choreographer and director who just revamped
Broadway's ``Scarlet Pimpernel,'' jaded New Yorkers and serious
theater buffs beware: the show includes 57 dancing Santas, numbers
syrupy enough to promote tooth decay in adults, and a halo-filled
Nativity pageant likely to provoke discomfort in nonbelievers.
</P>
<P>
   The opening scene, one of Longbottom's additions, is ``Santa's
Gonna Rock-and-Roll,'' which puts the whole cast through an ersatz
'50s-style number that includes a limber Santa gyrating and
vogueing. Next comes an endearing interpretation of Tchaikovsky's
``Nutcracker'' that features a multicultural collection of dancing
bears.
</P>
<P>
   This is followed by ``The Parade of the Wooden Soldiers,'' a
65-year-old mainstay that showcases the Rockettes' drill-like
precision and has costumes designed by Vincente Minnelli, before he
became a famous Hollywood director. The eight other scenes include
``Christmas in New York,'' shamelessly set at Rockefeller Center,
and ``Carol of Bells,'' which places prop bells in the hands of
every cast member.
</P>
<P>
   The tableau vivant set in a manger, the only nod to religion,
caps the show, followed by a rousing adieu from the two ``Mighty
Wurlitzers'' that flank the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas at Radio City officially started on Sept. 17, with the
Music Hall's highly publicized cattle call for new Rockettes. More
than 300 women from across the country showed up in leggings and
leotards that morning, hoping to fill one of the 20 vacancies this
year among the 56-member New York troupe. The women clogged the
sidewalk along West 51st Street, anxiously awaiting their turn to
do a quick series of tap and jazz steps.
</P>
<P>
   After being herded into a rehearsal room in groups of 30, they
were given one shot at the routine, which is briefly demonstrated
by three assistant choreographers. Cuts were made after the last
woman had finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you for entertaining us ladies,'' announced Tom Kosis,
an assistant choreographer, just before reading off the names of
those who would return for another round of auditions. Asked what
he was looking for, Kosis ticked off a list of Rockette attributes:
``Athletically fit. Great legs. A great smile. And shine.'' As he
spoke, a group of women _ most looking dejected _ filed out of the
room.
</P>
<P>
   Although the job is grueling, the dancers say the glamour
quotient _ and the $1,100-a-week salary _ makes up for the dizzying
performance schedule. Vetia Searcy, 21, an actress and dancer from
Mussel Shoals, Ala., said that to be a Rockette on the stage of
Radio City Music Hall ``is to be the most glamorous dancer in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   But this was not to be Ms. Searcy's year. She had the
unfortunate luck of being first in line, and unable to benefit from
watching others do the routine first, she flubbed the sequence. ``I
feel like such a loser,'' she sobbed afterward, hunched against a
wall in the corridor as the next group of hopeful dancers filed
into the room.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Amber Snow was one of the lucky ones. A dance teacher from
Twinsburgh, Ohio, Ms. Snow said joining the Rockettes fulfilled a
childhood dream sparked at age 11, when the company came to
Cleveland with Susan Anton as a guest star. ``After the show, they
had a meet-and-greet with the Rockettes; they let us kick with them
and I was smitten,'' said Ms. Snow, 20, who was wearing a
sweatshirt that said, ``Shut up and dance.''
</P>
<P>
   At 5 feet, 8{ inches, Ms. Snow stands perilously close to the
height limitation of 5 feet, 5{ inches to 5 feet, 9 inches that has
been strictly imposed for 65 years. (Despite a few attempts at
exaggerated uprightedness or slouching, several women failed the
tape measure test on the audition day).
</P>
<P>
   Uniformity, machinelike precision and extreme legginess are the
hallmarks of the Rockettes. Divas need not apply. ``If someone
stands out in the show, it's not a good thing,'' Longbottom said.
``This isn't for dancers who think they're going to get a solo.''
</P>
<P>
   The show's only real star is Charles Hall, a perpetually jolly
native of Kentucky who has been playing Santa Claus for the last
seven years. Hall's Santa is the show's master of ceremonies, and
his character helps stitch together the unrelated scenes. Hall, who
greets fellow cast members with a hearty ``Merry Christmas'' even
when he's out of character, takes his role very seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Santa is almost a spiritual thing for me,'' he said, taking a
break from the ``Santa's Toy Fantasy'' number, which features
prancing elves and oversize gift-wrapped packages. ``I have a very
important responsibility to the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall, who is 40, thin and nothing like the avuncular Santa
archetype, plays the role off-season as well, mostly for
promotional events. ``In August you can find me in some shopping
mall sweating in my Santa suit,'' he said. ``Santa pays the
bills.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Toy Fantasy'' number is the main showcase for the ``little
people,'' most of whom are under four feet. Marty Klebba, who is 4
feet, 1 inch tall, used to manage a chain of quick-change oil shops
in Detroit before he was hired to be an elf in 1991. Like most of
the little people, Klebba said the ``Christmas Spectacular'' had
changed his life.
</P>
<P>
   The exposure, he said, has led to other acting work, including a
job as a munchkin in a traveling production of ``The Wizard of Oz''
and the occasional television commercial. He said he did not mind
that the ``Christmas Spectacular'' featured his small stature, not
his acting abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking advantage of something that was a disadvantage all
my life,'' said Klebba, 29, who recently bleached his hair blond
and proudly displays an Oakland Raiders tattoo on his shoulder. He
and the show's other elves, who earn $30,000 for 10 weeks of work,
live at a residential hotel a block from Radio City.
</P>
<P>
   When he has free time, Klebba, who sometimes appears on the
Howard Stern show, likes to kick back at Scores, a topless club in
midtown.
</P>
<P>
   With its blocklong grand foyer and soaring auditorium, whose
curved arches are lit to resemble a sunrise, Radio City Music
Hall's architecture dazzles as much as the show does. When it
opened in 1932 as part of Rockefeller Center, Radio City was the
largest and most modern entertainment palace in the world and for
decades was a hallowed venue for live performances, movie premieres
and, more recently, President Clinton's 50th birthday party.
</P>
<P>
   Elaborate stage shows featuring the Rockettes, a live orchestra
and the ``Mighty Wurlitzers,'' once preceded every film. ``The
stage was never quiet,'' Michael recalled.
</P>
<P>
   But by the late '70s, the anachronistic stage show was losing
ground to racier forms of entertainment, and the music hall became
a drain on its owner, Rockefeller Center Inc. In 1978, the company
decided to replace the theater with a skyscraper, and the Rockettes
prepared for a final appearance on April 12.
</P>
<P>
   But at the end of that event, New York officials announced that
the state had agreed to invest $2.2 million to keep the theater
afloat until it could be brought back into the black. The
unprofitable stage shows, including the ``Easter Pageant,'' were
phased out, and concerts by Madonna, Menudo and the Grateful Dead
began drawing a new generation to Radio City.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ``Easter Pageant'' was briefly revived in 1990,
running for seven more years, the ``Christmas Spectacular'' remains
the only vestige of the variety show past.
</P>
<P>
   This is the show's last run before the music hall closes in
February for a six-month restoration. As part of its plan to make
the complex more profitable, Cablevision will spend $30 million to
replace the seats, the carpeting and the dancing curtain, which
will be threaded with fiber-optic lights that can produce a rainbow
of changing colors and patterns.
</P>
<P>
   The lobby's three-story Art Deco mural, the gold-leaf ceiling
and the blocklong marquee, with its six miles of neon tubing, will
also be restored. Cablevision plans to install a production center
for television specials and hopes to expand the Radio City name to
a cable channel, a record label and a radio station.
</P>
<P>
   Renovation is planned for the manual lighting system, which
includes 3,000 dimmer switches, and the fabled steam curtain, a
grill connected to Con Edison pipes that runs along the stage
spewing out steam for special effects.
</P>
<P>
   The hydraulic stage elevators, which can lift up to 23,000
pounds, will be updated for the first time since 1932. The system
was once considered so advanced that aircraft-carrier designers
studied it during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Rober is only the third person to run the elevators, among
the last in the country to operate on pressurized water. Both
Rober's father and a brother are employed by Radio City, a pattern
that has been repeated, it seems, among dozens of dressers,
carpenters and lighting engineers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always fascinated by old, greasy things,'' said Rober,
standing in the cork-lined pump room three stories beneath the
stage. ``I call it the Jules Verne room.''
</P>
<P>
   Rober is one of the few people left who actually understand the
hydraulic system, and he must make all repairs himself.
</P>
<P>
   When Radio City reopens next fall, the stage will be
computerized, as will the roving band car, which carries the
orchestra around the stage and is still driven by a technician who
must lie flat inside.
</P>
<P>
   As opening night approached and tensions spiked, a nasty flu was
passing through the company last week. Howard Kolins, the show's
executive producer, was one of the victims and found himself
griping more than usual. ``After 16 years on the show, and having
seen it thousands of times, I can complain and pick apart the show
like nobody else,'' he said, joking.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kolins' bad mood dissipated when the first audience _ at
a free dress rehearsal performance for disadvantaged and disabled
children _ poured into the auditorium early last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to make this into a religious experience, but
seeing those kids reminds me that this show can do incredible
things for people,'' Kolins said. ``It really does uplift the
soul.''
</P>

 &HT;    Field trip a frightening, exciting experience...for adults
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ The best part of taking 74 eighth_graders to
the zoo is bringing all 74 of them back. The boss is kind of picky
about coming out even, I remind myself as I watch the buses load.
</P>
<P>
   Four teachers, eight parent chaperones, four coolers filled with
bottled water, fruit, cookies, and enough ham and cheese sandwiches
to feed the economy section of a 747. I guess we're ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Count 'em,'' the principal orders just before the driver
closes the front door of our big yellow bus. I nod and turn to the
task. The writhing bodies remind me of fishing worms in a can.
</P>
<P>
   My first (silent) attempt at a headcount is futile so I begin
again _ out loud. From right to left: ``TWO, FOUR, SIX, TEN...''
Ten? I'm not much at math, but even I know that eight comes in
between six and ten. I try again: ``TWO, FOUR, SIX, TEN...'' Rats!
I have no choice but to thread my way down the aisle for a
close_up.
</P>
<P>
   ``TWO, FOUR, SIX, Aha!'' There in the next to the last pair of
seats are four heads where there should be only two.''You guys
going steady?'' I ask the four clowns who are piled up like a wad
of silly putty. They're playing dumb with that ``Who me?'' look
that kids do so poorly. It's a standoff they know they can't win
but that never stops them from giving it the old middle_school try.
</P>
<P>
   ``MOVE!'' I bark trying to sound scary.
</P>
<P>
   Four little boy faces gaze at me in wide_eyed innocence. I
threaten: ``Two of you move or this bus won't.'' The predictable
discussion follows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was here first!''''You move, it was your dumb idea.''''I'm
not sitting with a girl!''''Yeah,'' the fourth giggles,''girls have
cooties.'' I give them ten seconds and begin the countdown. The
rest of the bus counts with me. Too much pressure. The offenders
split and I count 40 heads.
</P>
<P>
   We're off. Next stop, the Toledo zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Before we unload, I make a couple of announcements. Lunch at
noon in the picnic area. Bus leaves at 1:15 _ be there! And
finally, I read off the names of the chaperones and the students in
their group. I know what's coming next so I beat them to it.''There
will be absolutely no changes _ no swaps. Relax and enjoy it.''
Groans but nobody threatens to jump ship.
</P>
<P>
   Suzy's pouting. She wants to be in the group with Donny _ her
love of the moment. Tearfully, she declares her life a ruin.''He's
with Patty and everyone knows she's been in love with Donny since _
forever!'' She's heartbroken. Ten minutes later I spot her on the
zoo train with Patrick. They're holding hands and giggling.
</P>
<P>
   Another teacher and I set ourselves up in a central location (a
picnic table under a buckeye tree) and prepare to serve as a
combined general information and missing persons bureau. Our first
customer is a runner for the chaperone of group seven.''We can't
find Bobby,'' a breathless Angie tells us.''He was with us in the
bug house but now he's gone.'' As if on cue, Bobby saunters by,
slurping from an ice cream cone bigger than his baby brother and
looking as if he had nowhere in particular to go. We send them off
to rejoin their group.
</P>
<P>
   Panic's ended. My colleague and I have a moment to focus on
students from another school district passing by. Naturally, we
compare notes. It turns out we're thinking the same thing: Boy, are
we lucky! This bunch looks like a traveling freak show. Our kids
have no green and yellow striped hair, no navel rings. Our school
rules don't even allow hats, frayed jeans, or shorts. It's a
respect thing.
</P>
<P>
   Before we know it, the day's over, buses loaded and we're on our
way home.
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes out of the zoo and 45 minutes away from school,
Benny yells up the aisle: ``Ms. Schuett! Ms. Schuett! I gotta'
go.'' I remind him this is a school bus not a Greyhound and he'll
have to wait. He moans and disappears into his seat.
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes later he's at it again.''Ms. Schuett, I really
gotta' pee!'' I tell him it's crude to share that kind of
information with a busload of folks, and remind him we're out in
the middle of nowhere _ nothing but cornfields. He says it sounds
good to him. I ask if he's going to mind having 40 kids watch. He
decides he can wait. But he was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   By the time we pull up to the school and the principal hops on
board to welcome us, Benny has had an accident in his pants, and
Bobby, the kid with the giant ice cream cone (and a small pizza,
(SET ITAL) and (END ITAL) a hot fudge sundae) has thrown up. But,
they're all here.
</P>
<P>
   My colleague and I write the trip up simply as: ``Things went
well.'' The boss likes to hear that.

 PAX TV's `LITTLE MEN' IS PRETTY MEDIOCRE  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Searching for straightforward, unvarnished preachments on how to
be a good person? You could do worse than ``Little Men,'' a series
premiering tomorrow on the Pax TV network. But not much worse.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Louisa May Alcott's lesser-known sequel to ``Little
Women,'' the first episode has an unrelenting pleasantness
reflective of the Pax TV ``family values'' philosophy, with breezy
references to Thoreau and Walden Pond tossed about to help educate
the masses.
</P>
<P>
   As serious drama, though, this adaptation of Alcott's 1871 story
about the grown-up Jo March flows swiftly into Lake Mediocre and
runs aground on Righteous Rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Men'' stars Michelle Rene Thomas as Jo, whose last name
is now Bhaer. In a departure from Alcott's story, Jo's middle-aged
schoolmaster husband, Fritz, has been killed off so Jo can carry
the single-woman-struggling-in-a-man's-world torch passed to her by
``Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' performance is earnest and unfailingly nice. Spencer
Rochfort is also nice as hunky handyman Nick Riley. And there's a
slew of nice kids at Jo's beloved Plumfield School for Boys.
</P>
<P>
   But running on nice is a sure way to slip and fall, and ``Little
Men,'' weighted down with artless pretension and overwrought
philosophizing, takes a serious header.
</P>
<P>
   Too, in aiming at an audience that includes young people,
``Little Men'' violates a cardinal rule: Don't talk down to kids.
For all its pleasantness, ``Little Men'' is unimaginative and
condescending, which guarantees passage on the next train to
sapsville.
</P>
<P>
   Little Men. Drama series about a young woman struggling to run a
boarding school founded by her late husband. Starring Michelle Rene
Thomas, Spencer Rochfort, Corey Sevier, Trevor Blumas, Brittney
Irvin, Alexander Campbell and Rachel Skarsten. Premieres Saturday.

49ERS TRIM PRACTICE TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CRUMPACKER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. _ To keep his players fresh in the second
half of the season, San Francisco 49ers coach Steve Mariucci has
trimmed about 10-15 minutes from the daily practice. The shortened
sessions will benefit players with nagging injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did that last year,'' Mariucci said Wednesday, his 43rd
birthday. ``We want to freshen up a little bit and have less time
on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   The team is preparing for Carolina after Sunday's loss to the
Green Bay Packers. Mariucci said he expected at least as good an
effort in the second half of the season as the 49ers gave in the
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``You start over. This is our opener,'' he said. ``Whoever
handles this eight-game season the best will get the bye, will get
the home field advantage. If we take care of business in the second
half of the season, we'll be in good shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect our team to respond the right way. I expect our team
to regroup and play an emotional game Sunday against Carolina. I
expect us to play hard and with emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci also said it was important not to ``wallow around in
meaningless confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   As opposed to meaningful confusion, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gabe Wilkins, who had knee surgery in May, will play
against Atlanta next week. Wilkins has been practicing with the
team since last week, Mariucci said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a heck of a pass rush drill, much better than last
week. We have to make sure (his knee is) not going to swell up. If
he can put a couple-three practices back to back to back we'll
activate him fairly soon.''

LIFE `WITH OSSIE &AMP; RUBY' IS A STORY OF HAPPINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE GANAHL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``We found after 30 years of talking to
audiences that the questions changed from `How do you get into show
business' to `What are the secrets to staying married so long?'''
chuckles veteran stage-and-screen actor Ossie Davis, the strength
of his basso profundo belying his 80 years of age.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we decided to write this book. To see if others might
benefit from what we'd learned.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Ruby Dee, his wife of 50 years and acclaimed actor in her
own right, ``It was a difficult process to bring it all together _
the rhythms of our personal life, the politics we were involved in,
and how we fit into that total pattern. But it was very
invigorating.''
</P>
<P>
   It took Dee and Davis two years to finish ``With Ossie &AMP; Ruby:
In This Life Together'' (William Morrow) a compelling memoir just
released to bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Ossie &AMP; Ruby'' sets their half-century-long marriage
against the backdrop of history, especially in regard to the
struggle for civil rights. Dee and Davis risked alienation from the
power establishment by devoting themselves to causes _ from Martin
Luther King to Malcolm X. Despite brushes with McCarthyism in the
'50s, they still managed to get choice roles. (Each has been
nominated for several Emmys, and are favorites of director Spike
Lee, who has cast them in many of his films, including ``Jungle
Fever'' and ``Do the Right Thing.'')
</P>
<P>
   They say their common passion for social change was one thing
that made their marriage flourish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were born into a struggle that was real, a life and death
one,'' says Davis, whose rural Georgia hometown was terrorized by
the Ku Klux Klan in his childhood. ``So the struggle was one of the
things that kept us together. We rarely had time to ask ourselves
`Are we happy, are our needMKDc.]L &LR;

`VELVET GOLDMINE': MIXING GLAM AND GLAMOUR IN A WILD, WILDEAN
SPIRIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: ``Velvet Goldmine'' was shown as part of this year's New
York Film Festival. Following are excerpts from Janet Maslin's
review, which appeared in The New York Times on Oct. 1. The film
opens Friday in Manhattan.) (js) 
 BY JANET MASLIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Todd Haynes' dazzlingly surreal ``Velvet Goldmine'' offers a
celestial ``Here's looking at you, kid'' to the heyday of British
glitter rock in general and to the David Bowie of the early 1970s
in particular. Without addressing Bowie directly, it appropriates
his shimmering, protean aura in virtuoso ways that put ordinary
period filmmaking or time-capsule musicology to shame.
</P>
<P>
   The astounding Haynes, whose last film (``Safe'') took place on
an entirely different planet from this one, brilliantly re-imagines
the glam-rock '70s as a brave new world of electrifying
theatricality and sexual possibility, to the point where
identifying precise figures in this neo-psychedelic landscape is
almost beside the point. ``Velvet Goldmine'' tells a story the way
operas do: blazing with exquisite yet abstract passions, and with
quite a lot to look at on the side.
</P>
<P>
   Structured as a rock ``Citizen Kane'' with an extraterrestrial
Rosebud, ``Velvet Goldmine'' traces its tendrils back to Oscar
Wilde, whom it imagines as a schoolboy. (``I want to be a pop
idol,'' this child sweetly announces.) A century later, the Wildean
spirit of flamboyance is spectacularly reborn, ready to erupt into
the glittery, pansexual pop utopia over which Bowie so dramatically
presided.
</P>
<P>
   The film doesn't force its musical references on audiences, but
it evokes them with vast fondness and fascination. ``People have
certain memories that they hold very dear, so you want to remain
true to them,'' Christine Vachon, the film's audacious producer,
has explained.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the wild Ken Russellish phantasmagoria of ``Velvet
Goldmine'' several essential characters emerge, central among them
the Bowiesque Brian Slade. Played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers as a
stunningly pretty, insolent, snake-hipped presence, he embodies the
provocative and mysterious heart of the film. Haynes, cerebral as
ever despite this film's explosion of visual sensuality, surrounds
Slade with implicit questions about art and inspiration, truth and
honesty, passion and repression.
</P>
<P>
   Playing what he has rightly called ``a birthday present of a
part,'' Ewan McGregor makes a fabulously charismatic rock star
named Curt Wild, who is both reproach and object of fascination for
Brian Slade. Whatever else he may be, McGregor's often hilariously
decadent Curt Wild is the real thing. With typically wicked wit,
the film mentions that Curt underwent early shock treatments ``to
fry the fairy clean out of him'' and that the net effect of this
was ``to make him bonkers every time he heard an electric guitar.''
</P>
<P>
   In a film that has at least one more major character than it
needs, and that like ``Safe'' overworks its elusiveness in ways
sure to confound some audiences, Christian Bale plays the
journalist a la ``Kane'' who investigates Brian Slade from the
chilly distance of 1984. That period is rendered no less fancifully
than the film's rainbow days, as Bale's doleful Arthur Stuart
reaches out from his dreary present to a past that both entices and
humiliates him. Arthur, the fan who is forever linked to Curt Wild,
conveys all the wistful distance of what it means to see the events
here from the outside, looking in.  &QL;

SOME POLLSTERS SAY `OOPS' ABOUT THEIR FINDINGS BEFORE TUESDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL DOUGAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Polls are not predictions _ a political reality
driven home by the gap between Tuesday's election results and the
highly publicized political surveys that preceded them in the final
week of campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   None of this year's polls in California erred so severely as in
1982, when Election Day projections placed Tom Bradley, not George
Deukmejian, in the gubernatorial winner's circle. Nonetheless,
academic observer David Kirp sized up this year's polling and
concluded Wednesday that the polls ``were farther off than usual.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Examiner's pollster _ Mason-Dixon
Political/Media Research _ judged U.S. Senate candidates Barbara
Boxer and Matt Fong to be in a virtual dead heat at the end of last
week. Boxer won by a 10-point margin. And Mason-Dixon gave Gray
Davis a 7-point lead over Dan Lungren in the contest for governor.
In fact, Davis finished with a 20-point lead by the time the smoke
cleared.
</P>
<P>
   The widely used Field Poll, conducted by a San Francisco firm,
missed calling the Senate race by only 1 point, but came up short
in declaring that Californians favored Davis over Lungren by 14
percent.
</P>
<P>
   National polls performed somewhat better: The Pew Research
Center and CNN-USA Today-Gallup declared, accurately, that voters
were split down the middle in their preference for Democratic or
Republican candidates. In fact, the final House vote was 211 for
Democrats, 223 for Republicans, while the Senate tally was 45
Democrats and 55 Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   On its Web site, the Gallup Poll suggested the Democrats might
even gain some House seats. The party ended up gaining five.
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters argue that even when their figures don't jibe with the
closing numbers, that doesn't mean they were wrong. Things change,
they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all due respect, I think we were right on the money,''
said Del Ali of Mason-Dixon. ``One thing a poll is not going to
predict is Hillary Clinton coming into (California) and the voters
being as energized as they were. ... I don't think anybody can
argue that this (senatorial) race didn't break loose until the
weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted the candidates campaigned for five days after the
poll-taking ended on Oct. 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at polls as a snapshot taken on a moving picture,''
said Mark DiCamillo of the Field Research Corp., which conducts the
Field Poll. For that reason, he said, it's not always a good idea
for polls to come out too close to the actual voting date.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, we want our final poll to correspond to the
election outcome,'' said DiCamillo. ``On the other hand, we know
that if we came out the day before the election, it would almost
certainly be judged as a prediction and we don't think that's the
best use of the polling methodology.''
</P>
<P>
   What value, then, do polls have in the process?
</P>
<P>
   ``The public is a nation of scorekeepers, just as you approach a
certain football game and ask `What are the odds?''' DiCamillo
said. ``That's what we're doing _ we're almost setting the odds
before an event occurs.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the Field Poll has on average come within 2 or 3
percentage points of matching election outcomes over its
half-century of polling Californians.
</P>
<P>
   Evaluating national results is trickier, said Frank Newport,
editor of the Gallup Poll. But he said his researchers came ``much
closer than the pundits'' to predicting the results this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few polls, even early in the fall, showed the Republicans
doing well,'' he said. ``As we got close this past weekend, we were
saying that the possibility for Democratic gains was certainly
real.''
</P>
<P>
   The danger, he said, is that ``mathematically a party can win 51
percent of the national vote and 100 percent of the seats if they
get 51 percent in every district.''
</P>
<P>
   Another hazard is that polls garner information through
questions that voters might not be ready to answer, said Kirp, a
professor and acting director at the Goldman School of Public
Policy at the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ask individuals to respond to questions that they may not
have fully thought through,'' he said. ``They get responses that
may not reflect the ... reality of the respondent's view.''
</P>
<P>
   This time out, he said, polls ``seemed to be missing some
current that spoke to the underlying economic satisfaction of
people. That was translated into election results that are pretty
status quo.''

LIFE `WITH OSSIE &AMP; RUBY' IS A STORY OF HAPPINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Refiling for those needing)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE GANAHL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``We found after 30 years of talking to
audiences that the questions changed from `How do you get into show
business' to `What are the secrets to staying married so long?'''
chuckles veteran stage-and-screen actor Ossie Davis, the strength
of his basso profundo belying his 80 years of age.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we decided to write this book. To see if others might
benefit from what we'd learned.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Ruby Dee, his wife of 50 years and acclaimed actor in her
own right, ``It was a difficult process to bring it all together _
the rhythms of our personal life, the politics we were involved in,
and how we fit into that total pattern. But it was very
invigorating.''
</P>
<P>
   It took Dee and Davis two years to finish ``With Ossie &AMP; Ruby:
In This Life Together'' (William Morrow) a compelling memoir just
released to bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Ossie &AMP; Ruby'' sets their half-century-long marriage
against the backdrop of history, especially in regard to the
struggle for civil rights. Dee and Davis risked alienation from the
power establishment by devoting themselves to causes _ from Martin
Luther King to Malcolm X. Despite brushes with McCarthyism in the
'50s, they still managed to get choice roles. (Each has been
nominated for several Emmys, and are favorites of director Spike
Lee, who has cast them in many of his films, including ``Jungle
Fever'' and ``Do the Right Thing.'')
</P>
<P>
   They say their common passion for social change was one thing
that made their marriage flourish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were born into a struggle that was real, a life and death
one,'' says Davis, whose rural Georgia hometown was terrorized by
the Ku Klux Klan in his childhood. ``So the struggle was one of the
things that kept us together. We rarely had time to ask ourselves
`Are we happy, are our needs being met?' We had to be always on the
ready for combat.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Dee, who was raised in Harlem, ``We've had the same
challenges faced by all couples when they're married. But the
struggle was our common jumping-off point, and it gave us a sense
of something larger than us.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis and Dee met while performing together at the American
Negro Theatre in Harlem. Her first impressions of him were not
immensely favorable. She writes that his clothes were definitely
all wrong _ ``a tall, skinny man dressed in the well-worn apparel
of a short, fat man.'' He found his future wife more pleasing:
``like a teen-ager with long, plaited hair and big eyes _ a very
nice-looking young lady who turned out to be Ruby Dee.''
</P>
<P>
   The he-said/she-said format of ``Ossie &AMP; Ruby'' works
wonderfully, giving readers two sides of every anecdote. Dee says
they were a bit concerned about divulging intimate details of their
early courtship. ``But our children are all in their 40s now, so
we're all adults. In fact, our son called us in tears after he read
the book, to thank us for sharing ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said there were other difficulties involved in the
writing. ``Well, I found out a lot of things about Ruby's life that
I never knew! And in summing up your life you are forced to look at
what you've accomplished. But by and large we feel like we've done
pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   And their marriage is one thing they are the most proud of. Do
they have any sure-fire techniques to share?
</P>
<P>
   Laughs Davis, ``The most important thing I learned that helped
me enjoy 50 years of marriage was listening, and to always consider
what I'm listening to. It wasn't always easy. But I think I came
out of each session a little smarter.''
</P>
<P>
   And Dee denounces the notion that their marriage is the model of
smoothness. ``Let's say we're in the process of mastering it. Every
age, every year is an opportunity for new discoveries about each
other. For that we are grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   Do they have plans to retire, to just relax and do nothing for a
change?
</P>
<P>
   Dee laughs. ``Well, we never did get into fishing!''
</P>
<P>
   And Davis adds: ``Oh, that will never happen. There's so much to
be done! And the more we learn about life the more it seems there
is to do.''

CD-ROM LANGUAGE TUTOR AIDS PRONUNCIATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By REBECCA ROLWING  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It's not enough to know that the pencil belonging to
Pedro is blue.
</P>
<P>
   On a new series of learn-a-language CD-ROMs, you'd better have
your Spanish pronunciation correct as well.
</P>
<P>
   Tell me (note: ``me'' is lowercase) More private tutor, which
scolds users out of bad accents, is made by Auralog S.A. of France,
which just set up its U.S. office in Phoenix in time for its recent
product launch.
</P>
<P>
   The $69.95 software is available in Spanish, French, Italian and
German. Japanese and Chinese are in the works and there's also a
version to teach English.
</P>
<P>
   The speech-recognition software asks users to engage in
conversation, play games, and watch skits and videos as part of the
learning process.
</P>
<P>
   That interaction should make the software fairly popular,
predicted Zim Jackson, senior marketing program manager for Tempe,
Ariz.-based Insight, which sells computers, software and
accessories over the Internet and telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be the cutting edge of technology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The software requires a computer with Windows 95 or 98, 486 DX4
100 MHz or higher. It's available at CompUSA and other electronics
stores.
</P>
<P>
   The concept for such technology has its roots in the early days
of speech recognition technology, when Auralog President Nagi
Sioufi was working for a company that manufactured airplane
engines. He was trying to create a system in which machinery would
respond to voice commands.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble was, the system worked only when workers carefully
pronounced the commands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was considered a failure,'' Sioufi said.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than scrapping the system, Sioufi came up with an
application in which enunciation of words was important _ a
language tutor.
</P>
<P>
   With a $10,000 price tag, early computerized tutors were hardly
affordable for casual users. Also, the technology could only grade
pronunciation of one word _ not a whole sentence _ at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Sioufi expects Tell me More, which was introduced in parts
of Europe in February, will be popular in America with tourists,
business travelers and students.
</P>
<P>
   Just like those days in high school Spanish class, the software
grades your pronunciation. It says whether you're speaking too
slowly and listens to your pronunciation.
</P>
<P>
   Those who don't know ``pelota'' (ball) from ``peligro'' (danger)
can adjust the software to be more forgiving. As the user becomes
more skilled in the language, a tougher standard can be set.
</P>
<P>
   The software has unlimited patience.
</P>
<P>
   If a word is troublesome, users can have the computer repeat it,
again and again. It also will play back how the student says a word
and will contrast it with how the word is supposed to be said.
</P>
<P>
   Exercises have the student carry on a conversation as though he
were in another country.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one drill has the student confirm a hotel
reservation, ask the cost of a room, ask to see the room and ask
for directions to a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's acting. It's pushing the student to act as if he is
playing a role in the conversation,'' Sioufi said.
</P>
<P>
   Cartoons liven up grammar lessons, and there are drills to work
on vocabulary and comprehension. Wrong answers get crash-and-burn
sounds while applause greets correct responses. &QL;

`ELIZABETH': AMOUR AND HIGH DUDGEON IN A CASTLE OF ONE'S OWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JANET MASLIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As when Leonardo DiCaprio (in ``The Man in the Iron Mask'') and
Isabelle Adjani (in ``Queen Margot'') reigned in France, the
captivating Cate Blanchett rules England in ``Elizabeth'' as if the
monarch's principal responsibilities were being bejeweled, choosing
consorts and saying ``Leave us!'' with a wave of the hand.
</P>
<P>
   This is indeed historical drama for anyone whose idea of history
is back issues of Vogue, but ``Elizabeth'' wants more. What with
the religious conflicts raging around her, the Virgin Mary as an
ultimate role model and the burden of keeping so many scheming
advisers at bay, this Elizabeth is presented as a glamorously
stressed-out modern woman who must cope with a super-intense case
of having it all.
</P>
<P>
   That the film's Indian director, Shekhar Kapur (``Bandit
Queen'') knew nothing about England's Queen Elizabeth I when he
undertook this lavish costume drama only helps to make his
Elizabeth that much sassier a sovereign, slouching on her throne.
</P>
<P>
   His film concerns itself with elaborate appearances,
anachronistically modern flourishes, Roman Catholic-Protestant
intrigue, the difficulty of resolving career with personal life and
the small matter of Elizabethan history, pretty much in that order.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging the influence of ``The Godfather'' on a film that
includes its own climactic bloodbath montage, Kapur and the
screenwriter Michael Hirst make spectacle their priority, often at
the expense of fact.
</P>
<P>
   Opening the film with an aerial shot of Protestant heretics
being burned at the stake pretty well establishes that this will
not be another staid royalty show. And Kapur's lusty, flamboyant
approach does suit the young Elizabeth, who is seen as she ages
from a blithe Botticelli Venus to the stony, regal monarch of the
film's last scene.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Blanchett, who was marvelous in ``Oscar and Lucinda,''
brings spirit, beauty and substance to what might otherwise have
been turned into a vacuous role. Still, it's jarring when the Queen
dances in the midst of admirers as if this were ``Saturday Night
Fever'' or sounds an awful lot like Tootsie when she declares: ``I
may be a woman, Sir William. But if I choose, I have the heart of a
man!''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Blanchett's flouncing Elizabeth is bolstered by an
impressive supporting cast, though the secondary characters engage
in so many schemes that you may wish Bill, that nice new playwright
from Avon, would drop into the film and make more sense of the
dramaturgy.
</P>
<P>
   Short of invoking Shakespeare before his time (the film begins
in 1554), ``Elizabeth'' tries every conceivable way to tart up its
action. Elizabeth's lover Lord Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes), who
would later be stepfather to her lover the Earl of Essex, is seen
here as an occasion for scenes of soft-core amour.
</P>
<P>
   Her wild suitor the duc d'Anjou (Vincent Cassel) cross-dresses,
while his scheming aunt Mary of Guise (Fanny Ardant) demonstrates
how fetching armor can look with a scarf thrown over one shoulder.
Kathy Burke rages so vividly as Queen Mary Tudor that it looks as
if Charles Laughton had ascended to the English throne.
</P>
<P>
   The other players, for whom a scorecard would be helpful,
include Geoffrey Rush as the coolly calculating Sir Francis
Walsingham, Elizabeth's trusted adviser; John Gielgud as the
scheming Pope in a resolutely anti-Catholic drama; Christopher
Eccleston as the stern Earl of Norfolk, and Richard Attenborough as
the busybody Sir William Cecil, who tries to keep a watchful eye on
the headstrong queen.
</P>
<P>
   Minor figures in this crowded story have names like Mary's
Dwarf, Male Martyr and Bishop (in Cellar). Also featured
prominently in ``Elizabeth'' are at least five castles and a
cathedral, as well as Hans Holbein (the younger)'s famous portrait
of Elizabeth's father, Henry VIII.

 A TENOR WHO LIVES A DRAMA
</HEADLINE>
   (af) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the American tenor Anthony Dean Griffey
portrayed the hulking, half-witted Lennie in Carlisle Floyd's opera
``Of Mice and Men'' at the Glimmerglass Opera in Cooperstown, N.Y.,
in 1997, he inhabited the role so thoroughly it was almost
frightening. The composer himself was deeply moved and mightily
impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``His was as perfectly realized a portrayal as anyone could hope
for, both musically and dramatically,'' Floyd recalled recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never found even one unconvincing moment in his work on the
stage, and believe me I looked,'' he added. ``He was always Lennie.
Other tenors sort of attack the role. He embodies it.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, who is 31, will undertake the role again when the
production, based on the John Steinbeck novella, comes to the New
York City Opera Saturday night. But how did this soft-spoken,
baby-faced young tenor come to understand so intimately such a
tormented and pathetic character?
</P>
<P>
   Lennie is slightly retarded, almost childlike in his innocence,
and genuinely unaware of his sometimes uncontrollable physical
power. Lennie and George, his friend and protector, are migrant
workers in California during the Depression. But they constantly
have difficulties with employers and the law because Lennie is
always inadvertently getting them into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I identify with Lennie deeply,'' Griffey said recently, taking
a break from a rehearsal at City Opera. ``But, in a way, I identify
with George just as much.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Lennie, Griffey knows what it means to be abused and
ridiculed. Growing up in High Point, N.C., a furniture factory town
of 75,000, he lived in constant fear of his illiterate, abusive and
alcoholic father, who mocked his son constantly about being
overweight. At its worst, the abuse turned physical.
</P>
<P>
   On three occasions, Griffey said, his father broke his nose,
eventually necessitating a corrective sinus operation. One time, he
added, his father broke his jaw, and Griffey still grapples with
the result: an underbite.
</P>
<P>
   But like George, Griffey had to become the protector, and
surrogate father, to the rest of his family: his younger brother,
Mark, and his mother, Joyce, a well-meaning woman who was nearly
illiterate, and, like her husband, a furniture factory worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a victim, too,'' Griffey said, ``and there wasn't much
she could do to stop it.'' As the eldest, he had to lock the doors
at night to the four-room, cockroach-infested house they lived in;
he had to read the mail and pay the bills. Several times he had to
fend off investigators from the child welfare department.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's father, who did not return telephone calls seeking
comment for this article, was eventually diagnosed with
schizophrenia. ``I wound up taking care of my father,'' he said.
``I remember once, when I was 9, calling up his employer to find
out why my father had been fired, and ask if he could please have
his job back.'' It was a childhood that could come right out of a
gritty Steinbeck novel.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is a triumphant side to this story. Somehow,
Griffey, whose early musical training came from his Baptist church,
found the will to accomplish a great deal: a master's degree on
scholarship from the Eastman School of Music; private studies in
New York with Beverly Johnson, who is still his teacher and mentor;
the advanced certificate program at Juilliard and acceptance into
the Metropolitan Opera's Young Artists Development Program.
</P>
<P>
   Now, his career is thriving. Last spring he sang one performance
in the daunting title role of Britten's ``Peter Grimes'' at the
Met, and he will sing the role at the Glyndebourne Festival in
England in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, he sang a widely praised performance in the title
role of Mozart's ``Idomeneo'' during the Mostly Mozart Festival at
Lincoln Center. Most recently, he created the role of Mitch in
Andre Previn's ``Streetcar Named Desire'' at the San Francisco
Opera, a performance that will be broadcast over public television
on Dec. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey stands just over 6 feet 4 inches, and weighs over 300
pounds. He has a voice to match his hefty build: a natural,
ringing, sizable tenor. Not surprisingly, he has been receiving
offers to sing the weighty dramatic tenor roles of Wagner and
Verdi. But he is wary of moving in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hard to cast, some people say, because they hear me with
their eyes instead of their ears,'' he explained. ``They see this
big guy and think: huge, dramatic heldentenor. But I actually think
of myself as a lyric tenor.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, more Mozart is in his future. The conductor Seiji Ozawa
has asked Griffey to sing in some forthcoming performances of
``Cosi Fan Tutte'' and ``Don Giovanni'' in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   But not surprisingly, given his personal history, Griffey is
most drawn to the anguished outsider roles, like Grimes, and, of
course, Lennie.
</P>
<P>
   The lyrical quality of Griffey's voice humanized his portrayal
of Lennie, Floyd said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unusual for someone with a voice of that size to be able
to sing with such delicacy,'' Floyd explained. ``His command of
mezza voce in his top voice is remarkable. And it's critical that
we fall in love with Lennie if we are to understand how George puts
up with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd singled out a defining moment in the first scene, when
Griffey brought a natural sweetness and vulnerability to the
poignant, halting soliloquy when Lennie explains why he has been
carrying a dead mouse in his coat pocket; he just likes having
something soft that he can stroke and pet.
</P>
<P>
   Singing in ``Of Mice and Men'' will be particularly meaningful,
and difficult, this time, because of the most recent trauma in his
personal life.
</P>
<P>
   In June, while he was in North Carolina to sing at the wedding
of a friend, his married brother, Mark, who Griffey said had been
increasingly unstable, appeared at his big brother's hotel room in
the middle of the night.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother is diabetic, and he was out of control, eating lots
of sugar, basically trying to kill himself,'' Griffey said. ``I had
to call a magistrate and check him into a hospital.'' As Griffey
had feared, the diagnosis was schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark is doing much better now,'' Griffey said. ``He lives in a
treatment center and is on medication. We talk every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Though his brother receives some disability benefits, and his
mother, who has completed her high school equivalency course, has a
job in a day-care center, they rely on Griffey, still the surrogate
father, for financial and emotional support. His parents are now
divorced; his father is confined to a retirement home, and they
have not seen each other in years.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Griffey had kept the most painful details of his
story to himself. But now, he says, he feels compelled to talk
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want people to have an awareness that mental illness is not
about the homeless person on the street,'' he said. ``It can be any
of us. And one family member's illness becomes the illness of
everyone in the family.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not a new concern for Griffey: he spent five summers
working at a camp for disabled and retarded children in North
Carolina. But there is more at stake in his openness.
</P>
<P>
   Often, when Griffey reached some performance milestone,
well-intentioned people would come up to him afterward to offer
congratulations. ``They say: `Oh, your parents must be so proud.
Are they here?' '' Griffey explained. ``I usually just say no. But
I guess I'm tired of putting up a front.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother has, though, attended two of his breakthrough
performances, despite considerable trepidation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, while in the Met's training program, Griffey made his
company debut in a minor role, as one of the knights in
``Parsifal.'' For the first time in her life, his mother traveled
outside of North Carolina, taking the train to New York and
attending the performance of this mystical, six-hour opera.
</P>
<P>
   Placido Domingo, whom she did not really know about, sang the
title role. ``It was a major culture shock, of course,'' Griffey
said. ``But it was still nice for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, she attended her son's performance as Peter Grimes,
traveling by air for the first time in her life. This just added to
the pressure on Griffey. As he was covering the role for another
tenor, he had not had a stage or orchestral rehearsal. Before the
performance that night, and during it, when Grimes is not onstage,
Griffey was walked through the staging in a rehearsal room.
</P>
<P>
   ``There I was, singing my first Peter Grimes at the Met,'' he
said. ``And all I could worry about was whether my mother somehow
had managed to follow my careful instructions and get herself from
the hotel to her seat.''
</P>
<P>
   What meant more to his mother was seeing Griffey on television,
when he sang in a performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony,
conducted by Ozawa, that opened the Winter Olympics in February in
Nagano.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd called Griffey a ``rare bird in this music business.'' He
added, ``He has maintained his authenticity as a person and not
taken on any professional veneer, which is very refreshing.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd said that while moved by Griffey's dramatic sensitivity as
a performer, he is equally impressed by his musical skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lennie is a very difficult role, in terms of tessitura and
rhythmic intricacy, and Tony Griffey sings it with complete ease,''
he said. ``I never expected to hear it sung as accurately as he
does. I had gotten used to hearing vocal accommodations, especially
during the very physical scenes: the fight, the murder.''
</P>
<P>
   For a man of his size, Griffey moves commandingly onstage, with
the vigor of other hefty actors, like John Goodman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a stand-and-sing opera singer,'' Griffey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been told by directors and conductors that unless I lose
weight, I will be relegated to character roles,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   So far, that has not happened. But Griffey acknowledges the
problem and, with time and continued support, he believes he can
boost his confidence and get in better physical shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every morning, when I wake up in my new apartment, in a nice
bed with nice sheets, I look for signs,'' he said. ``Am I OK? Did I
get through all this? That's why I got all this education, to prove
something to myself. Every time I sing, I have my little ritual. I
tell myself, `Sing to express, not to impress.' And I try.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I will even shed the weight,'' he added, ``when I get
some of the mud off my wings.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The composer Carlisle Floyd's 1969 adaptation of John
Steinbeck's ``Of Mice and Men'' will be performed Saturday evening
at 8 by the New York City Opera at the New York State Theater. The
cast of this new production includes Anthony Dean Griffey in the
role of Lennie and Dean Ely as his friend and protector, George.
Stewart Robertson conducts.
</P>
<P>
   The opera will also be performed Nov. 13 at 8 p.m., Nov. 15 at
1:30 p.m., Nov. 19 at 7:30 p.m. and Nov. 21 at 1:30 p.m. Tickets,
$20 to $90. Information: (212) 870-5570.

 &HT;    CLINTON PRESENTS 21 MEDALS FOR ARTS AND HUMANITIES
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (e) entertainment categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Celebrating the songs of a folk troubadour, one
woman's fight against illiteracy and the career of a Hollywood icon
who challenged the nation's views on race a generation ago,
President Clinton handed out 21 national medals for arts and
humanities Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the medalists were folk legend Ramblin' Jack Elliott, of
Marshall, Calif.; Nancye Brown Gaj (all cq), of Raleigh, N.C.,
founder of Motheread Inc., which helps impoverished parents learn
to read, and veteran actor Gregory Peck of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today, we honor an extraordinary group of Americans whose
daring vision and indelible contributions to arts and humanities
have opened all our eyes to the richness, diversity, and miracles
of the human experience,'' Clinton said, addressing several hundred
friends and family members of the recipients gathered beneath a
large white tent on the White House South Lawn.
</P>
<P>
   In a world of challenge and change, ''We need our artists and
patrons, our historians and educators, to help us make sense of the
world,'' Clinton said, adding that the medalists ''have laid the
foundation for a new century of greater American creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, an Arkansas native, had special words of praise for
Peck and his Oscar-winning portrayal of a courageous lawyer's
lonely stand against racism in a small Alabama town in the movie,
''To Kill a Mockingbird,'' based on the novel by Harper Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Peck's performance ''stirred the conscience of a nation,'' said
Clinton before presenting the Medal of Arts to Peck, whose black
moustache contrasted vividly with a full mane of silver hair.
</P>
<P>
   ''His performances have helped to heal some of our country's
deepest wounds,'' said Clinton, who has put the issue of race in
America near the heart of his own domestic agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ''For many,'' said Clinton, ''he will always be Atticus Finch,''
the character Peck played in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Elliot, one of the seminal inspirations cited by such rock
greats as Mick Jagger and Bob Dylan, said receiving his medal was a
high note in a career that has already produced 40 albums.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was just trembling from the joy and trying to keep from
falling off my feet,'' Elliot, wearing a calf-length black coat and
large black Western hat, said in a brief interview after the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he was surprised at the enduring impact his career
has had on popular music, Elliot said, ''These things are all very
difficult to digest. It's in the realm of magic. It's all
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard University humanities professor Henry Louis Gates Jr.,
was awarded the humanities medal for his work in African American
studies. He said his representation signaled the importance of the
field and reflected the relatively new emphasis on the nation's
cultural diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ''The group of recipients chosen signifies a measure of openness
we wouldn't have seen at a ceremony like this 20 years ago,'' Gates
said in a South Lawn interview. ''To those of us in fields like
African American studies, awards like this are testaments to our
field, because America has always been multicultural _ it's just
been in denial about it.''
</P>
<P>
   A medal of arts also went to the Steppenwolf Theatre Co., in
Chicago, and one of the most famous actors to come out of the
company showed up as part of a support troupe.
</P>
<P>
   John Malkovich said later that the award recipients reflected
the vitality and promise of the American arts and humanities
community.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of those people are sort of mold-breakers in a way, and in
a very American way,'' said Malkovich. ''It just shows that, on
some level, people are watching, people do read what they write,
people do think about what they say.''
</P>
<P>
   The national arts and humanities medals are awarded by the White
House each year to artists, patrons and scholars, based on their
life's work.
</P>
<P>
   The other medalists were:
</P>
<P>
   _ New York dancer and choreographer Jacques d'Amboise
</P>
<P>
   _ New Orleans rock 'n' roll pianist and singer Antoine ''Fats''
Domino

CALIFORNIA GIRDS FOR DEBATE OVER GAY MARRIAGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL NESS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For Charlie Spiegel and Jim Emery, San Francisco
lawyers and life partners, Hawaii and Alaska's resounding votes
against gay marriage spell the end of hope _ at least for a while _
that they can truly protect and provide for their baby girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it changes is that a number of us thought we would have
within the next couple of years the opportunity to go to Hawaii to
be legally married and come back to California and see what rights
and responsibilities we can take on here,'' Siegel said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The day before, two-thirds of voters in both Hawaii and Alaska
passed constitutional amendments to outlaw gay marriage. The votes
aimed to preempt courts that were considering making the states the
first in the nation to allow gay men and lesbians to wed.
</P>
<P>
   California voters will face a similar preemptive initiative on
the June 2000 ballot if it qualifies, as expected, by the end of
November.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Siegel and Emery will be among a number of couples
protesting at the San Francisco county clerk's office, along with
ministers and other advocates of same-sex marriage. They intend to
apply for a marriage license, knowing they'll be rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not necessarily to take the fight to the courts in
California, which would be one route, but to use it as an
opportunity to focus attention on the need for legal protection for
gay families,'' Siegel said. ``We have a 2-year-old daughter, and
there are certain protections she can only get if we are recognized
as a family.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Deaner, who is organizing the protest as head of the All
Our Families Coalition, said, ``The purpose is to sensitize
Californians to the fact that our perfectly good families are being
denied their family civil rights for no real reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay marriage opponents said the Hawaii and Alaska votes
bolstered their effort to pass the California Defense of Marriage
Act in 2000. It's patterned after the federal law passed by
Congress and signed by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results in Hawaii strengthen our hand in California
because it shows the voters that it is not anti-gay to support
traditional marriage,'' said Andy Pugno, spokesman for state Sen.
Pete Knight, the Republican who is the driving force behind the
anti-gay-marriage initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Pugno said gay rights advocates in Hawaii had tried to make the
case that preventing gays from marrying was discrimination akin to
the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II or the old
ban on interracial marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hawaiian voters didn't buy it,'' Pugno said. ``That is a good
indication for California.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said polls in the hard-fought Hawaiian campaign
had predicted a much closer vote, so polls showing that 58 percent
of voters here opposed gay marriage probably were understating
public sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   In Hawaii, the issue moves to the state legislature, which
voters Tuesday authorized to pass a law limiting marriage to
opposite sex couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, there will be an awful lot of energy and effort to
try to stop that from happening,'' said Jenny Pizer, an attorney
with the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, the gay civil
rights group leading the legal fight for marriage.
</P>
<P>
   And still pending is the court case that started it all,
awaiting oral arguments before the Hawaii Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The Alaska initiative amended the state constitution to limit
marriage to opposite sex couples, which likely spells the end to
the court challenge there, Pizer said.
</P>
<P>
   The focus now is shifting to Vermont, where the Supreme Court
will hear oral arguments Nov. 18 in a case brought by same-sex
couples that were denied marriage licenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the end of the issue,'' said Pugno. ``There's
still a great need for California to decide on the issue of gay
marriage before it becomes a reality.''

`THE WATERBOY': MUD DOGS! MUD DOGS! RAH RAH RAH! 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at the end of review.) 
(js) 
 By JANET MASLIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   That ``amazing 31-year-old freshman'' tearing up the football
field is none other than the former ``water distribution
engineer,'' Bobby Boucher (Adam Sandler). Bobby is a simple soul
from bayou country. He comes from a swampy home sweet home where
Mama (Kathy Bates) proudly cooks snake roast (the apple in its
mouth is a nice touch) and where Steve the pet mule is right at
home in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   When he first appears in ``The Waterboy,'' Bobby contentedly
rides a lawn mower about town at 10 miles an hour. He doesn't yet
have a clue about what fun it would be to put on a football uniform
and knock the stuffing out of an opposing team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Waterboy'' gives Sandler a perfect excuse to lapse into
happy idiot mode, with a silly voice and sillier grin and silly
sight gags all around him. But in collaborating again, after ``The
Wedding Singer,'' with a group of his college buddies, including
Frank Coraci as director, Sandler comes out looking like an
honorary Farrelly brother, turning dumbing-down into loony,
unapologetic fun. Like the Farrellys' ``There's Something About
Mary,'' this escapist comedy is so cheerfully outlandish that it's
hard to resist, and so good-hearted that it's genuinely endearing.
There's a lot more innocence to what Sandler does than there is in
many a film made specifically for children.
</P>
<P>
   As in ``The Wedding Singer,'' Coraci wisely surrounds Sandler
with seasoned, appealing actors who lend a touch of class. Ms.
Bates, decked out so colorfully that it looks as if the circus had
come to town, is an utter hoot as the domineering mother who keeps
Bobby in line. (She also appears in black-and-white flashbacks
talking to a young, impressionable water boy, since Bobby had the
job as a child and never grew up to do anything else.) Ms. Bates
has one of her funniest scenes feeding barbecued baby gators to
Vicki Vallencourt (Fairuza Balk), the sexy little jailbird who
means to lead Bobby astray.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Waterboy'' tells what happens when Bobby is fired by a
half-decent college team (with Jerry Reed as its fire-breathing
coach) and winds up on an abysmal one: the backwoods Louisiana Mud
Dogs, with a 40-game losing streak and cheerleaders so depressed
that they sit around getting drunk on the sidelines. Out here in
football Siberia, the coach (Henry Winkler) is another seasoned
loser, but soon he and Bobby have achieved a meeting of the minds.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the Mud Dogs only to make sure they don't drink
cockroach-infested sludge, Bobby accidentally shows his mettle on
the playing field. It turns out that anybody who slights a) Bobby's
mother or b) Bobby's water supply had better be ready for Bobby
Boucher, fighting machine.
</P>
<P>
   Though the film moves predictably enough from here _ want to
guess whether the Mud Dogs will have a phenomenally good season
with Bobby's help? _ it stays enjoyably goofy throughout. There are
bad-hair flashbacks to the 1970s, Louisiana frog cakes with the
legs sticking out, one guy who speaks with an absolutely
unintelligible Cajun accent, and heads that morph into Bobby's
imagined enemies just before he flattens players on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Sandler keeps himself sweetly ridiculous while also managing to
give his character some heart, and Ms. Bates makes a hilarious
comic foil. Even Ms. Balk, who usually plays much nastier roles,
fits into the film's overall high spirits and witty naivete.
Sandler succeeds in doing to football whatever he did to golf
(``Happy Gilmore'') and in making his version of the sports-savant
movie look like an awfully good bet.
</P>
<P>

convened his Cabinet on Thursday to ratify the Israeli-Palestinian

   NICARAGUA-MUDSLIDES (Posoltega, Nicaragua) _ Where just a week
ago there were fertile fields of corn, beans and peanuts almost
ready for harvest, there are now only discolored corpses, swelling
grotesquely in the sun. For Central America, Hurricane Mitch and
the floods and landslides that followed in the storm's wake have
been a catastrophe. No place, however, has been harder hit than
this collection of humble agricultural settlements, where at least

   SWISS-ANTISEMITISM (Geneva) _ Anti-Semitism has resurged in
Switzerland in reaction to recent intense scrutiny of the country's
wartime actions, a government commission said Thursday. A year-long
study of the phenomenon found that inhibitions against openly
expressing racist views had been swept away amid the bitter
controversy over Switzerland's responsibility to compensate

`KISS' ISN'T QUITE STRANGE ENOUGH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Kiss of a Stranger'' is an ``erotic thriller'' that follows
all the conventions of the genre _ except that somehow, it got
theatrical play. As the tired plot, the familiar faces who've seen
better days, and the obligatory nudity unfold, you feel like going
up to the projection booth to see if there's a video box lying
around.
</P>
<P>
   Among the movie's problems: 1) It's not all that erotic; 2) It's
not terribly thrilling; 3) Shannon Tweed must've been busy. So
Mariel Hemingway steps into the Tweed role as Nova Clarke _ great
erotic-thriller name, there _ an entertainment reporter who's some
sort of nightmare combination of Mary Hart and Kathie Lee Gifford.
</P>
<P>
   If that's not enough cheesy fame for you, Nova is the daughter
of popular singer Leslie Clarke (Dyan Cannon, lip-syncing songs
that wouldn't make it past the trash-or-smash segment on a
light-rock station) and has-been Irish rocker Peter Dixon (David
Carradine, doing everything he can to perpetuate a stereotype
except have a good Irish accent).
</P>
<P>
   But back to Nova. At a party after one of her mom's shows, she
hooks up with a smoldering stud named Nathan (Matt Battaglia), and
despite it being completely out of her character, she has a
one-night stand with him. Do you have to be told that this guy is
bad news?
</P>
<P>
   No, you don't, because virtually every straight guy in the movie
is some level of creep, although Robert Walden (Rossi on ``Lou
Grant,'' remember?) shows some sympathy as Leslie's manager. The
only really nice guy is Nova's co-host, Brian, who is gay, because
in Hollywood's mind, beautiful women just can't have platonic
relationships with straight guys. Not that we see much of Brian's
lifestyle _ he picks up a nice-looking dude in the early scenes,
and then we never see the companion again until the last scene,
because Brian spends all his time with Nova.
</P>
<P>
   This allows Brian to help Nova play Nancy Drew when Nathan
disappears after their brief fling, only to reappear two months
later, immediately inspiring more fear than curiosity in Nova. And
she should be scared, although if her instincts were working this
well the first time around, the whole movie never would've
happened.
</P>
<P>
   Let's be honest here. The only reason people really watch erotic
thrillers is for the erotic part; we know the thriller part isn't
going to be very good. So be warned: You aren't going to see
Hemingway naked. You do get to see her romp in the sack with
Battaglia, in a series of dissolve shots that are supposed to be
pretty but are merely pretentious.
</P>
<P>
   Which leaves the thriller part, which telegraphs every one of
its ``shocks.'' Frankly, it's not lurid or mean enough, although
there are some mildly interesting plot twists along with a heavy
dose of dime-store Freudianism. Writer-director Sam Irvin,
hamstrung by a small budget and a 12-day shooting schedule, had to
compromise his, er, vision to get familiar names like Cannon and
Corbin Bernsen, who plays Nova's producer. Irvin should have stood
his ground, because what he winds up with is a potentially edgy
tale that's too polite. You almost expect an ``excuse me for that''
line in the closing credits.

 &HT;    POSSIBLE GINGRICH CHALLENGER KNOWN FOR ABILITY _ AND HOT TEMPER

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Bob Livingston was considering leaving the
House this year, Speaker Newt Gingrich called to urge the tall,
hot-tempered Republican congressman from Louisiana to stick around.
</P>
<P>
   That call could come back to haunt the embattled speaker. With
Gingrich being blamed for the poor GOP showing in Tuesday's
elections, Livingston is widely rumored as a potential challenger
to lead the shaken, shrunken GOP majority in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning his third term as the powerful chairman of the
Appropriations Committee, Livingston has hardly kept secret his
ambition to become speaker.
</P>
<P>
   While he earlier dismissed notions that he would ever challenge
Gingrich, Livingston has told reporters that ``I've already got
most of the votes sewn up'' should the speaker someday decide to
step down. And that claim came before the election results left
some disgruntled House Republicans muttering about a quicker change
in leadership.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, few doubt that Livingston is tough enough for
the job. At 6 feet, 5 inches in height, the 55-year-old
conservative is an imposing figure. He is known for a fast and
fiery temper. Congressional Quarterly's ``Politics in America''
describes a 1995 incident when Livingston nearly came to blows with
an aide to Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., then the chairman of the
Agriculture Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some son of a bitch on your staff has been saying bad stuff
about my staff to the press and I'm tired of it,'' Livingston
reportedly told Roberts before being physically restrained.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as much as Gingrich, Livingston personified the ill-fated
government shutdown in 1995 _ a showdown between the congressional
Republicans and President Clinton that helped Democrats portray the
GOP as extremists in the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will never, never, never give in,'' Livingston vowed three
days before Christmas. ``We will stay here until doomsday.''
</P>
<P>
   Recalling how this thunderous sound bite was repeatedly shown on
television, Livingston later told The New York Times, ``My mother
told me not to do that any more. She thought I was a raving
lunatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston is not without a sense of humor, albeit one that is
sometimes pointedly political. On his first day as chairman,
Livingston came to an Appropriations Committee meeting armed with a
machete and a alligator-skinning knife _ ready to cut the federal
budget. In 1993, he wore a clown's hat and a red plastic nose to
ridicule what he called a ``goofy'' Democratic bill to change
campaign finance rules.
</P>
<P>
   The mercurial Livingston has been methodical in his quest for
the speakership, however.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the Appropriations Committee, he holds the
federal purse strings and can help Republican colleagues with
funding for projects in their home districts. His position also is
a magnet for hopeful political contributors, so he channels
campaign funds to needy Republican candidates. His political action
committee _ Building Our Bases, or BOB's PAC _ contributed $546,000
to more than 90 House members and Republican candidates, the New
Orleans Times-Picayune reported this week.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   First elected in 1977, Livingston has represented the First
District of Louisiana for 10 terms. Covering much of Jefferson
Parish, the district includes Metairie and other middle-class,
mostly white suburban communities around New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   One of Livingston's forebears helped negotiate the Louisiana
Purchase from France, and his ancestors include Southern
politicians and planters. A well-heeled lawyer, he was the first
Republican to represent the area since Reconstruction, but in the
changing South, he has had no trouble being re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Colorado, Livingston grew up in New Orleans. His parents
divorced with he was 7, and he and a younger sister were reared by
their mother. After dropping out of Tulane University, Livingston
joined the Navy. After his hitch ended, he married in 1965 and
returned to Tulane to earn a bachelor's degree and then to graduate
from law school.
</P>
<P>
   He is married to the former Bonnie Robichaux, and they have four
children.
</P>
<P>
   A steadfast fiscal conservative, Livingston was Gingrich's
choice to chair the Appropriations Committee when the Republicans
took over the House in 1994. One qualification was the toughness to
play Scrooge to political allies as well as enemies as the new
majority sought to slash spending.
</P>
<P>
   But in two decades in Congress, he has been wise enough in the
ways and means of Washington to have sent millions of dollars in
federal projects to shipbuilders in his district.

RESURGENT DEMOCRATS UNLIKELY TO ROCK BOAT IN CALFORNIA

   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ A sweeping cultural change is about to rush
through the state Capitol, with Democrats dominating the government
for the first time in 16 years. Yet don't expect tie-dyed
liberalism of the Jerry Brown days to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``For maybe one 24-hour period, when I realized there might be
Democratic control of the Assembly, the Senate and the governor's
office, my wish list got very long,'' said Kathy Dresslar, a
lobbyist with the Children's Advocacy Institute. ``But to think in
those terms can be very disillusioning, because the Democrats of 16
years ago are very different from the Democrats of the 1990s.''
</P>
<P>
   California voters on Tuesday elected a moderate Democrat, Lt.
Gov. Gray Davis, to succeed a pragmatic Republican, Pete Wilson, in
the governor's office. Wilson was barred by law from running for a
third term.
</P>
<P>
   Davis made education his top priority during the campaign, and
promised to call a special session of the Legislature to toughen
standards for students.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his proposals, however, have been debated extensively by
legislators and the gap between what Wilson sought and what Davis
wants are narrow.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest impact in the change is two years away.
Democrats, because they will control the Capitol, will get to
redraw the state's congressional and legislative districts after
the 2000 Census. Their work could add 10 seats in Congress for
Democrats, and change for a decade the face of politics in
California.
</P>
<P>
   The gains for Democrats in California stunned Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats kept the offices of lieutenant governor, controller
and state schools chief, and they gained the state treasurer's
office and the biggest prize of all: the governorship. Only
Republican Secretary of State Bill Jones and Insurance Commissioner
Chuck Quackenbush survived.
</P>
<P>
   Dejected Republicans attempted to regroup Wednesday, and
promised to be watchdogs for the next two years. In part because
Davis transferred hundreds of thousands of dollars from his
campaign into legislative races, Democrats gained five seats in the
Assembly and two seats in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just got run over by a truck,'' said Assembly Republican
leader Bill Leonard, who resigned his leadership position Wednesday
because of the devastating losses for his party. ``I believe no
matter what the fault is, when a loss occurs on a leader's watch,
it's time for a new leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard said Republicans would not fade away, noting he served
four years in the Assembly acting as a balance against the
administration of former Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown. He said Davis
ran this year on a centrist platform, and Republicans will hold him
to his promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's one thing the Republicans are going to be
watching very closely,'' Leonard said, ``whether it's a centrist
(administration) or an extreme one. I don't think voters are going
to be ready for the extremist one.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Madrid, political director for the GOP, said Democrats
could see a backlash if the Legislature goes too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be incumbent on Davis to keep the Legislature at
bay,'' Madrid said. ``The Democrats are probably going to be a
little overzealous, and they may overstep their bounds.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The old Robert McCrum was an adventurous and peril-prone fellow
whom I'd have enjoyed sharing a few beers with; the new Robert
McCrum is a thoughtful man I would seek out as a friend.
</P>
<P>
   Born the son of a Cambridge don into a family ``as fortunate and
privileged as you could wish for,'' McCrum at the age of 42 in 1995
was editor in chief of the British publishing company of Faber &AMP;
Faber, a firm he had joined 16 years earlier and whose ranks he had
ascended through a combination of talent and what seems certainly
to have been sheer enthusiasm for the work. Perhaps in reaction to
the accustomed certainty and evenness of his life, he had developed
what he calls an ``addiction to physical risk,'' traveling to
battle zones in far-off places in search of derring-do and danger.
He seems never to have been able to free himself of a certain
restlessness of soul. In fact, he had become restless even at the
job he so much enjoyed. He had been divorced for many years, and
his personal life was equally unsettled. Something within him had
begun insistently to urge a change.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the beginning of that change had presented itself in
October 1993 at the Frankfurt Book Fair, when cCrum was introduced
to Sarah Lyall, then a reporter for The New York Times covering
book publishing and now one of its London correspondents. Their
attraction to each other was immediate, and their subsequent love
affair was rendered no less intense by the necessity that so much
of its first months be conducted trans-Atlantically by phone and
jet flight. They were married on May 13, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Lyall was on assignment in San Francisco only six
weeks later, McCrum, alone in their house in London late one night,
suffered a stroke. Its cause in such a youngish man remains even
now undetermined, but there is no uncertainty about its effects.
His entire left side, including his face, was immediately
paralyzed, and he lost the ability to physically articulate speech,
although his mental functioning was fortunately unaffected. ``My
Year Off'' is a meticulous and highly literate account, written by
a gifted storyteller, of that harrowing night and its aftermath. It
is a book difficult to lay aside until its final sentence has been
reached.
</P>
<P>
   The author's intent is to lead his reader through every step of
the stroke's acute phase and the long recovery process, and in this
he succeeds admirably. He takes us with him from his agonizing
attempts to drag his naked, unwieldy body headfirst down two
flights of stairs toward the living room phone until his ultimate
return to a new career as literary editor of The Observer, almost
exactly a year later.
</P>
<P>
   All through the early stages of his treatment and the drawn-out
months when he found himself slowly resuming his ability to carry
out ordinary tasks of ordinary living, McCrum kept a diary and so
did Ms. Lyall. Many of the diary entries appear in this book. We
meet the doctors, nurses, therapists, friends and fellow stroke
veterans who contributed so much to his eventual rehabilitation.
And we smell the smells and taste the tastes of life in several
health care centers. Here is McCrum at his best as a chronicler.
But here also is my one serious quarrel with the way he has chosen
to tell his story.
</P>
<P>
   McCrum is too much the journalist, too much the reporter _
somehow needing to be just sufficiently detached from the turmoil
in his guts that it remains hidden from his readers. His is a book
more of observations than of feelings. When again and again he
tells of being ``depressed'' and even hints at ``shame'' and
``despair,'' he lets them only be words. He writes of ``a mood of
existential crisis, a mood that can still easily recur, lending the
world a strange, provisional air, even now,'' but he tells us no
more than that. Early in his book he states that ``communicating
experience is what I do,'' and indeed, he does it very well. But he
keeps his deepest emotion to himself, except to let us sense that
it is there for him to know but not really for us to understand.
Perhaps he can do no more: ``When I reread my journal now,'' he
writes, ``I am surprised how detached I seem to be about my
experience, but that, I suppose, lies in my nature.'' He was, after
all, brought up in ``a world in which the frank acknowledgment and
discussion of emotion was seen as needlessly self-indulgent.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lyall, on the other hand, lets us into her mind. The brief
passages from her diary light up this book with a humanity that
clarifies the perceptions and even the transformation that both of
them underwent as a result of her husband's illness. Her thoughts
are the key that opens up the rich chamber of their inner lives. It
is because of her willingness to give us an image of him that he
never fully discloses that I see him as someone who has passed
through a firestorm to become the man I would seek out as a friend.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It is given to the new Robert McCrum that he comes to view the
world and himself _ and his deepening love for his wife _ in ways
that would have been incomprehensible to him had he not been
plunged into the crucible of his sickness. His life, his values and
his attitudes are forever changed by what he has endured and
overcome. Long before awakening to find himself paralyzed, he had
begun his attempts to embark on a journey toward finding some
answer to the perennial questions we all ask ourselves continually,
or should. He states it succinctly as ``Who am I?'' The stroke
became the vehicle by which he could set out and find so much of
that answer, with his wife helping him to navigate his way. He has
used his illness well.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of ``My Year Off,'' the author sums up his
near-tragedy and its aftermath with the thought that he feels
``purged and renewed by the waters of ill health; perhaps _ who
knows? _ my stroke had been a blessing in disguise.'' At several
earlier points in the book, he has written of finding meaning in
John Donne's 1624 meditation, ``Devotions Upon Emergent
Occasions,'' and quoted the passages that clarified his
comprehension of what he was going through. It seems to me that
McCrum's experience exemplifies yet another sentence in that small
masterpiece: ``No man hath affliction enough that is not matured,
and ripened by it.''

<P>
   It was far from a landslide, as numbers went; but, politically,
it was stunning. With something resembling defiance, America's
voters on Tuesday returned a Congress containing five more
Democratic members of the House and exactly the same balance as
before between the parties in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   With a Democratic president, in his sixth year in office, facing
impeachment by a Republican Congress, this was not supposed to
happen. But even the Republicans' richly financed efforts in the
last week of the campaign to whip up contempt for Clinton fell
flat. The voters sent a message, through his party, that they liked
him and wanted him to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Assessing what this means for Clinton is easy: it buoys him up
remarkably. What it means for his party is less clear.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, candidates and voters did their best in the
campaign to blur or ignore party labels. In New York, Charles
Schumer won a Senate seat as a pro-death-penalty Democrat. In
Florida, Jeb Bush won the governorship as a Republican reaching out
to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere, Republicans were billed as ``moderate'' (read:
pro-abortion-choice), and Democrats as ``conservative'' (read: not
for high taxes). Growing numbers of voters, especially in outdoorsy
and heavily forested states, proclaimed that they were independent.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, too, relatively few people -- about 37
percent of registered voters, much the same as in 1994 -- actually
voted. The reasons for this apathy were short-term, in part.
Americans in 1998 are satisfied and prosperous: the savings ratio
is now negative for the first time in a generation, and
third-quarter growth, at an annualized 3.3 percent, is still
comfortably robust.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors, however, are much longer-term. Party affiliation
has always been more tenuous in America than in Europe. The clash
of ideologies is not much appreciated, still less the political
log-jams that go with it. Most voters do not want partisanship:
they want politicians who keep taxes low, make the streets safe and
get things done. In short, to most people, party hardly matters any
more.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is decidedly nothing to replace the two-party hegemony
of Democrats and Republicans. Except in states like Maine, where
the Independent governor, Angus King, won thunderous re-election,
or Minnesota, where a hulking pro-wrestler, Jesse ``The Body''
Ventura, won the governor's race as a candidate vaguely attached to
Ross Perot's Reform Party, there are no other parties remotely in
prospect. Even if there were, they would have no money unless their
founders bankrolled them privately.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-party mischief plays well on the hustings for all the
reasons given above; but almost all candidates, whatever their
pretensions, must be wired to a party money-machine like patients
to a drip-feed.
</P>
<P>
   As everyone now knows, the raising of such money in the 1996
elections took the party committees down some shady back-alleys.
But distaste only goes so far. Those who try to rip out their
money-dispensing tubes, as the Democratic Senate incumbent, Russ
Feingold, did in Wisconsin, are brave and lonely figures. (Feingold
won, but by the skin of his teeth.)
</P>
<P>
   Few candidates dare either to turn down the funds or to irritate
the party establishment. It is the strength of these
money-machines, above everything, that ensures that
campaign-finance reform is thrown out again and again in Congress,
which in turn ensures that the two main parties will keep their
grip on American political life.
</P>
<P>
   The party system in itself has virtues; in modern America, it is
always to be preferred to the alternative, which is the inherently
selfish pushing of policies by lobbyists and single-issue groups.
Yet the parties that approached the mid-term elections were
demonstrably in a shambles, disunited and contributing very little
to the progress or governance of the country. Hence the widespread
public indifference.
</P>
<P>
   What is interesting is that, as a result of the elections, both
the shambles and the indifference may now start to change.
</P>
<P>
   Start, inevitably, with the Democrats, whose despair of a few
weeks ago has now been transformed into delight. Going into the
elections the party was adrift, afraid to embrace the tainted
president but equally afraid to condemn him. Now, suddenly, it
knows which way to go; it can treat Bill Clinton as an asset again.
</P>
<P>
   This warm re-embrace is crucial, and not just because he is the
president. Clinton is the most talented politician the party has (a
man who, even this autumn, could still outflank the Republicans to
get the budget he wanted), and its only visionary. For six years
now -- indeed for closer to ten, if one counts Clinton's reforming
work at the Democratic Leadership Council -- the party has come to
depend on his ideas of what it should be: in short, a party
unafraid to befriend business, support free trade and begin to snip
the apron-strings of the nanny-state.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton does not have a great deal to show, in legislative
terms, for this bold shift to the center. The doomed attempt to
reform American health care in 1993 must now stand as the only big
reform that he tried on his own initiative. The reform of welfare
in 1996 and the balanced-budget agreement of 1997 came only after a
strong shove from the Republicans, who in 1994 had swept Congress;
and by then the president's reformist zeal had already become
miniaturist, revolving round school uniforms and V-chips in
computers.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy of his reckless slide into possibly impeachable
conduct was that his party's reformist program capsized with him.
It will hardly recover now -- too late for that -- but he might at
least become the Democrats' leader again.
</P>
<P>
   Some would say he has not quite managed that yet. He was never a
politician with coat-tails, and he has never schmoozed with the
congressional Democrats as, say, Lyndon Johnson did. His lack of
skill in this department, combined with his shift to the center,
has given an opening to the diehard chunk of the party that never
went away: the ``old'' Democrats, speaking for the poor,
minorities, environmentalists, blue-collar workers, and all who
feel threatened or left behind by the modern world. This is the
rump of the party that Franklin Roosevelt made in the 1930s,
committed like glue to activist government.
</P>
<P>
   These people have a compelling argument: they have seen the
future, they fear it, and they want government to help. Five years
ago the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA) almost fell to
left-wing sniping, and last year Clinton's attempts to get
fast-track authority for trade-agreements were wrecked by it. The
old Democratic line proved so persuasive in that case that only one
in four House Democrats gave the president their support.
</P>
<P>
   This wing of the party, captained by Dick Gephardt, the House
minority leader, has not been soothed by good economic times. On
the contrary, it has seen them as a new reason to condemn the
colossal inequities in American incomes and in society at large.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt has taken Tuesday's results as a vindication that ``the
people'' want to be heard. He said much the same when fast-track
fell. The labor unions, who contributed $37 million to the party in
1996, like his stand on trade, and may well finance Gephardt to
some extent if he decides to run against Al Gore in the Democratic
primaries in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   He will probably still run, but Tuesday's results may have
changed his calculations. For some time, Gephardt has maintained a
frosty distance between himself and Clinton, even declaring in 1995
that the House Democrats were ``an independent organization.''
Subsequent efforts to bind them to the main party, including a
meeting last July chaired by Hillary Clinton at her most soothing,
failed to lead to the hoped-for entente cordiale.
</P>
<P>
   But the very people who were most motivated to vote on Nov. 3 to
show their support for Clinton were precisely ``old'' or
``liberal'' Democrats -- women, Latinos, and especially blacks, who
almost doubled their share of the total vote. Given that wave of
sympathy, and given the strength of Gore's probable Republican
rival, Gephardt may make himself less thorny for a while. He may
become, for tactical reasons, almost Clintonite.
</P>
<P>
   This will give a respite to Gore. The vice president can only
benefit from the boost to the fortunes of his leader, to whom he
has always been linked as closely as hand to glove. After a period
when he seemed as uncomfortable in his inevitable succession as
Britain's Prince of Wales, he jumped rip-roaring into the last
weeks of the campaign, as if he could sense the way the wind was
blowing.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats will now undoubtedly begin to close ranks behind
Gore as Clinton's heir. But this has a drawback, from Gore's point
of view; it makes it harder for him to be his own man.
</P>
<P>
   He has never offered his party a philosophy, beyond the vaguely
spiritual greenness that used to be his trademark. Nor has he given
much indication of how good a leader he is. He has none of
Clinton's consummate political talent or his ability, on occasion,
to stare down awkward friends.
</P>
<P>
   But the plain fact is that no Democrat (not Gore or Bill Bradley
or Bob Kerrey, or those other time-worn names with a toe in the
water) impresses as much as the man who, by his own folly, has
deliberately made himself smaller than he should be.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the Democrats, how do the Republicans stand?
Since election day, the picture is more confusing. They have
become, and remain, the majority party in the sense that matters:
if America can be said to have a political complexion, this is now
Republican. In the past decade, almost all the social changes that
have swept America have moved it in a Republican direction.
Manufacturing industry, a rich source of Democratic votes through
the labor unions, has given way to the non-unionized service
sector.
</P>
<P>
   Whole regions have moved away, too. As the South has modernized,
abandoning its legacy of segregation, Republicans -- once spurned
as the anti-slavery party -- have not only gained a foothold there,
but have feasted on the region's natural conservatism. The
fastest-growing parts of the country, in California and the Rocky
Mountain West, are also natural Republican territory: gung-ho for
development, prosperous and suburban.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's elections do not alter that. The Republicans have very
slightly lost their grip on Congress, but they still control it.
Their position is even stronger at state level, where they hold 31
(previously 32) of the 50 governorships. This seems to underline
their supremacy well into the future, since it is governors who
will preside over the congressional redistricting that will follow
the census in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   For some years now, too, the more pushy and interesting
political figures have come from the Republican side of the fence.
The party has had momentum; it has had money, and, for a brief
glorious spell, it also had ideas. In September 1994, just before
the last set of mid-term elections brought a Republican landslide,
Newt Gingrich presented his ``Contract with America'': a list of
ten policies which, he promised, would get through the House within
100 days. Amazingly, most of them did, and even got further.
</P>
<P>
   The shell-shocked Democrats found themselves agreeing to
deregulation, devolution of power to the states, the loss of
congressional perks, and the wholesale rearranging both of federal
subsidies to farmers and welfare payments to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, however, nothing of this fervor remained. The
Contract died long ago, and nothing has succeeded it. The
Republicans assumed that Americans backed their revolution, when
the vote of 1994 was really a slap at the Clinton Democrats; and
they were stalled by their own arrogance, which reached its apogee
when they shut down the government in the winter of 1995 rather
than compromise over the budget.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, though they have held their slim majorities, they
have lacked the legislative skill to do much with them against a
Democratic president. As Gingrich told the Washington Post
recently, Republican leaders are still ``learning to govern.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich himself, reviled by the public and almost the victim of
an internal party coup against his speakership in 1997, has still
not recovered, and Tuesday has made it worse. The once-brilliant
leader is now mocked not just for being clumsy over the budget and
allowing Democrats the advantage, but for misreading the popular
mood and calling the election wrong.
</P>
<P>
   There are curious parallels here with the Democrats. The one
Republican who could be called a visionary, whose eyes are fixed on
a future Utopia and how to get there, has been weakened by his own
folly. Gingrich has his batty side, and it is not clear what his
new idea, ``21st-century Reaganism,'' really adds up to, beyond an
assertive foreign policy and lots more computers. But he gave his
party, for a while, a blistering coherence, and that has
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Political pundits think Gingrich, who has a formidable
money-raising machine, may just possibly recast himself and run in
2000; but his congressional troops will be harder to reassemble.
Their shoulder-to-shoulder unity on the various inquiries into the
president's conduct, culminating with the inquiry into impeachment,
looks all the more vindictive because the party is divided on so
much else.
</P>
<P>
   The internationalist Gingrich (and, to a lesser extent, the more
parochial southerners, Trent Lott and Dick Armey, who lead the
Republicans in the Senate and the House) are still bothered by the
wilder elements who came into the House with the landslide of 1994.
These Republicans -- now revelling in the acronym CATs, for
Conservative Action Team, and centered round David McIntosh of
Indiana -- have not forgotten the Contract and, especially, the
moral dimension it was meant to have. In small print at the bottom
of the list were limits on abortion, support for prayer in schools
and -- ever since the appearance of Starr -- a crusade against the
nationwide depravity represented by the president.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's results have been a decided slap in the face for that
crusade. Highly motivated conservative voters were balanced, to say
the least, by highly motivated Democrats. The public, which has
already told pollsters overwhelmingly that it does not want special
prosecutors to be preachers, does not want its politicians to be
preachers, either. Most Americans want abortion to stay legal. Most
prefer, too, to keep intact the wall the constitution has carefully
erected between church and state. And most think their sinning
president should be left alone.
</P>
<P>
   Every Republican nominee for president, down to Bob Dole in
1996, has struggled to incorporate the moralistic wing of the party
into some notional ``big tent'' where all opinions are ostensibly
respected. It is bound to do so, it supposes, because of their
legions of supporters outside Congress. Randy Tate's Christian
Coalition, Gary Bauer's Family Research Council, Jim Dobson's Focus
on the Family, are pressure groups the party hates to alienate,
even if they have nowhere else to go. Every time Dobson threatens
to flounce out of the party and take his people with him (as he
last did in February), the leaders must scramble to soothe him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they know now, for sure, that it is just as dangerous to
pander to these groups. Even throwing tiny bones in their direction
(as when Lott, in June, called homosexuality ``a sin'') gets them
into instant trouble with the great mass of voters who are tolerant
sorts.
</P>
<P>
   There have been strong signs, too, that the more the Republican
Party appears to be led by the nose by the religious right, the
more businessmen become unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   On China policy, for example, corporations were astonished that
the right cared more to make a point against religious persecution
than to secure open trade. It would be a disaster for the party if
business hands stayed in pockets. But the right is now so furious
with the party leaders' mistakes that they will now be more
disruptive than ever.
</P>
<P>
   There is also another problem to face: the cavalier way in which
the Republican Party has ignored or even antagonized the
fast-growing Latino electorate. Latinos, whose self-reliance and
old-fashioned morality would seem to make them natural Republicans,
have been enraged by Republican support for anti-immigrant
proposals, both locally and in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, sensing the drift, began last year to soft-pedal his
party's bids to restrict immigration and end job preferences based
on race. Several Republican candidates started Spanish lessons, and
governors in heavily Latino places (especially the Bush brothers,
George and Jeb, in Texas and Florida) made pitches for the Latino
vote. This worked in both states, with both Bush brothers winning
handsomely on Tuesday; but it made no difference in the most vital
contest, the governor's race in California, where two-thirds of
registered Latino voters are now Democrats. There, the Republican
lost.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Republicans' hubris has come back to haunt them.
They are indeed still learning, and sometimes they learn too late.
Shouting in a vacuum It is strange, but no accident, that most
discussion of the present state of the parties ends up by focusing
on the most disaffected sectors. These are the parts that make the
noise and provide the color against the vapid centrism of everyone
else.
</P>
<P>
   But, with their essentially backward-looking ideas, they also
keep Congress in an ideological log-jam in which little gets done.
If, for different reasons, the parties begin to unite and present
themselves more positively, matters might improve.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the parties have occasionally borrowed useful
ideas from each other and have even managed that American idyll,
bipartisanship. Indeed, the distinctions between the parties have
been blurring for a decade or so. President George Bush's brand of
Republicanism was advertised as ``kinder and gentler,'' caring
about the little man; Clinton's version of the Democratic credo
stressed fiscal responsibility and a certain social
hard-heartedness.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Gingrich eruption inspired, in the end, yet more
cross-dressing. Its apotheosis came in the agreement, last year, to
balance the federal budget; an agreement made easier for both sides
by soaring tax revenues as the economy boomed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this was almost all the last Congress produced. Old partisan
habits meant that, on most issues, the parties took up their
routine positions: in favor of spending the budget surplus on a tax
cut (Republicans), or for using it to save Social Security
(Democrats); against school vouchers (Democrats), or for them
(Republicans).
</P>
<P>
   Policies which require a certain amount of open-mindedness, or
which might be hard to explain in 30-second sound-bites to voters,
seem to sink in bipartisan indifference. This is what happened to
the attempt to reach agreement with the tobacco companies over
lawsuits against them; and it is what happened, almost needless to
say, over campaign-finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Debate did not simply evaporate because Clinton was distracted,
though that did not help. The parties were distracted, too. Their
job -- as they have seen it in recent years -- is not to tease out
policy, no matter how much the think-tanks on both sides ply them
with studies. Their job is to raise money continuously and on a
vast scale to make sure their candidates are kept in, or pushed
into, power.
</P>
<P>
   So, given that this remains their job, whom will the parties
push into power next? The answer is more encouraging than recent
history, with its record of carefully packaged and anodyne
presidential candidates, might suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, iconoclastic governors are the men to watch. Most
presidential campaigns contain a governor or two, and they have
often been the victors in recent years; but the present crop is
different. They have more power than their predecessors, because of
the devolution of social services that followed the 1994 Republican
sweep; and they have more money, because the economic boom has
filled their tax coffers. As it happens, every one of them is a
Republican: and they may offer precisely what the warring party
needs.
</P>
<P>
   The man on whom hopes have come to rest is George Bush, Jr., the
Republican governor of Texas, who was re-elected on Tuesday with 69
percent of the vote. He is a pretty mild version of the breed: a
man who is judged, and who sees himself, less as a great reformer
than a unifier of factions.
</P>
<P>
   But that is good enough. Bush has proved to have tremendous
coat-tails; so tremendous, that the Republicans won every statewide
race. He has a famous name, and he has -- at least on his Texas
showing, all cowboy boots and drawl -- a large dose of that
essential ingredient, charisma. Money pours after him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he is merely the most-marketable tip of Republican talent
from the states and cities. Consider Tommy Thompson, the governor
of Wisconsin, a pioneer both in reforming welfare and streamlining
government services; brother Jeb in Florida, with his new, caring
brand of Republicanism; Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, who has slashed
business taxes; and -- among the mayors -- New York's Rudolph
Giuliani, who has revelled in iconoclasm and showmanship as he has
cut crime and cleaned up the city.
</P>
<P>
   The energy of the Gingrich revolution, which has so notably
drained out of Congress, still survives at state level; and it is
this that has given America much of its present Republican
coloring.
</P>
<P>
   But here lies the irony. Voters overwhelmingly vote for these
men not because they are Republican, but because they get things
done. If a governor cuts taxes, draws investment and makes the
schools better, it does not matter what his affiliation is, just as
it does not matter what his race is. These men in their domains --
unlike the self-proclaimed ``free spirits'' among the congressional
candidates, who tend slavishly to vote with their party once they
get to Washington -- can seize or borrow any policy they choose,
pursue any group of voters they think useful, and have no
philosophy at all except what they like and what works. Their
wholehearted pragmatism also means that they either have little
time for the party's more moralistic policies, or give them a
gentler cast.
</P>
<P>
   This independence can cause occasional heartburn to the party
power-brokers. They do not know quite what these local Republicans
are up to, and are clearly afraid that on some issues, such as
education reform, they are getting way ahead of them.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the Republican governors have not forgotten how
the congressional party has blown hot and cold on block grants to
the states to fund social services. But the devolution of power to
the states is not to be reversed, unless a deep recession drives
the governors back into Washington's arms.
</P>
<P>
   The party therefore has to make an uncharacteristic leap of
faith: it can have its highly attractive Mr. Fixit candidates,
while accepting that they appeal directly to the voters' dislike of
partisanship and the party machines. But here an intriguing paradox
emerges. That same Mr. Fixit, if he can get past residual
suspicions, may end up uniting his disparate party behind him as he
has previously united his state. A George Bush, indifferent as he
may appear to political labels, makes his party stronger.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge, now that the elections have suggested greater
cohesion among both Democrats and Republicans, will be for stronger
parties to produce strong agendas and productive ideas. Eyes are
turning eagerly to the prospect of Bush v Gore: the new outsider
and the old insider, two potential soothers of party factions who
lead their rivals by miles -- but who are not noted for their
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   All that remains, if America is to enter the 21st century with a
two-party system that actually works, is for them to find the ideas
that will inspire their factions to unite rather than fight.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It was far from a landslide, as numbers went; but, politically,
it was stunning. With something resembling defiance, America's
voters on Tuesday returned a Congress containing five more
Democratic members of the House and exactly the same balance as
before between the parties in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   With a Democratic president, in his sixth year in office, facing
impeachment by a Republican Congress, this was not supposed to
happen. But even the Republicans' richly financed efforts in the
last week of the campaign to whip up contempt for Clinton fell
flat. The voters sent a message, through his party, that they liked
him and wanted him to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Assessing what this means for Clinton is easy: it buoys him up
remarkably. What it means for his party is less clear.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, candidates and voters did their best in the
campaign to blur or ignore party labels. In New York, Charles
Schumer won a Senate seat as a pro-death-penalty Democrat. In
Florida, Jeb Bush won the governorship as a Republican reaching out
to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere, Republicans were billed as ``moderate'' (read:
pro-abortion-choice), and Democrats as ``conservative'' (read: not
for high taxes). Growing numbers of voters, especially in outdoorsy
and heavily forested states, proclaimed that they were independent.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, too, relatively few people -- about 37
percent of registered voters, much the same as in 1994 -- actually
voted. The reasons for this apathy were short-term, in part.
Americans in 1998 are satisfied and prosperous: the savings ratio
is now negative for the first time in a generation, and
third-quarter growth, at an annualized 3.3 percent, is still
comfortably robust.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors, however, are much longer-term. Party affiliation
has always been more tenuous in America than in Europe. The clash
of ideologies is not much appreciated, still less the political
log-jams that go with it. Most voters do not want partisanship:
they want politicians who keep taxes low, make the streets safe and
get things done. In short, to most people, party hardly matters any
more.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is decidedly nothing to replace the two-party hegemony
of Democrats and Republicans. Except in states like Maine, where
the Independent governor, Angus King, won thunderous re-election,
or Minnesota, where a hulking pro-wrestler, Jesse ``The Body''
Ventura, won the governor's race as a candidate vaguely attached to
Ross Perot's Reform Party, there are no other parties remotely in
prospect. Even if there were, they would have no money unless their
founders bankrolled them privately.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-party mischief plays well on the hustings for all the
reasons given above; but almost all candidates, whatever their
pretensions, must be wired to a party money-machine like patients
to a drip-feed.
</P>
<P>
   As everyone now knows, the raising of such money in the 1996
elections took the party committees down some shady back-alleys.
But distaste only goes so far. Those who try to rip out their
money-dispensing tubes, as the Democratic Senate incumbent, Russ
Feingold, did in Wisconsin, are brave and lonely figures. (Feingold
won, but by the skin of his teeth.)
</P>
<P>
   Few candidates dare either to turn down the funds or to irritate
the party establishment. It is the strength of these
money-machines, above everything, that ensures that
campaign-finance reform is thrown out again and again in Congress,
which in turn ensures that the two main parties will keep their
grip on American political life.
</P>
<P>
   The party system in itself has virtues; in modern America, it is
always to be preferred to the alternative, which is the inherently
selfish pushing of policies by lobbyists and single-issue groups.
Yet the parties that approached the mid-term elections were
demonstrably in a shambles, disunited and contributing very little
to the progress or governance of the country. Hence the widespread
public indifference.
</P>
<P>
   What is interesting is that, as a result of the elections, both
the shambles and the indifference may now start to change.
</P>
<P>
   Start, inevitably, with the Democrats, whose despair of a few
weeks ago has now been transformed into delight. Going into the
elections the party was adrift, afraid to embrace the tainted
president but equally afraid to condemn him. Now, suddenly, it
knows which way to go; it can treat Bill Clinton as an asset again.
</P>
<P>
   This warm re-embrace is crucial, and not just because he is the
president. Clinton is the most talented politician the party has (a
man who, even this autumn, could still outflank the Republicans to
get the budget he wanted), and its only visionary. For six years
now -- indeed for closer to ten, if one counts Clinton's reforming
work at the Democratic Leadership Council -- the party has come to
depend on his ideas of what it should be: in short, a party
unafraid to befriend business, support free trade and begin to snip
the apron-strings of the nanny-state.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton does not have a great deal to show, in legislative
terms, for this bold shift to the center. The doomed attempt to
reform American health care in 1993 must now stand as the only big
reform that he tried on his own initiative. The reform of welfare
in 1996 and the balanced-budget agreement of 1997 came only after a
strong shove from the Republicans, who in 1994 had swept Congress;
and by then the president's reformist zeal had already become
miniaturist, revolving round school uniforms and V-chips in
computers.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy of his reckless slide into possibly impeachable
conduct was that his party's reformist program capsized with him.
It will hardly recover now -- too late for that -- but he might at
least become the Democrats' leader again.
</P>
<P>
   Some would say he has not quite managed that yet. He was never a
politician with coat-tails, and he has never schmoozed with the
congressional Democrats as, say, Lyndon Johnson did. His lack of
skill in this department, combined with his shift to the center,
has given an opening to the diehard chunk of the party that never
went away: the ``old'' Democrats, speaking for the poor,
minorities, environmentalists, blue-collar workers, and all who
feel threatened or left behind by the modern world. This is the
rump of the party that Franklin Roosevelt made in the 1930s,
committed like glue to activist government.
</P>
<P>
   These people have a compelling argument: they have seen the
future, they fear it, and they want government to help. Five years
ago the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA) almost fell to
left-wing sniping, and last year Clinton's attempts to get
fast-track authority for trade-agreements were wrecked by it. The
old Democratic line proved so persuasive in that case that only one
in four House Democrats gave the president their support.
</P>
<P>
   This wing of the party, captained by Dick Gephardt, the House
minority leader, has not been soothed by good economic times. On
the contrary, it has seen them as a new reason to condemn the
colossal inequities in American incomes and in society at large.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt has taken Tuesday's results as a vindication that ``the
people'' want to be heard. He said much the same when fast-track
fell. The labor unions, who contributed $37 million to the party in
1996, like his stand on trade, and may well finance Gephardt to
some extent if he decides to run against Al Gore in the Democratic
primaries in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   He will probably still run, but Tuesday's results may have
changed his calculations. For some time, Gephardt has maintained a
frosty distance between himself and Clinton, even declaring in 1995
that the House Democrats were ``an independent organization.''
Subsequent efforts to bind them to the main party, including a
meeting last July chaired by Hillary Clinton at her most soothing,
failed to lead to the hoped-for entente cordiale.
</P>
<P>
   But the very people who were most motivated to vote on Nov. 3 to
show their support for Clinton were precisely ``old'' or
``liberal'' Democrats -- women, Latinos, and especially blacks, who
almost doubled their share of the total vote. Given that wave of
sympathy, and given the strength of Gore's probable Republican
rival, Gephardt may make himself less thorny for a while. He may
become, for tactical reasons, almost Clintonite.
</P>
<P>
   This will give a respite to Gore. The vice president can only
benefit from the boost to the fortunes of his leader, to whom he
has always been linked as closely as hand to glove. After a period
when he seemed as uncomfortable in his inevitable succession as
Britain's Prince of Wales, he jumped rip-roaring into the last
weeks of the campaign, as if he could sense the way the wind was
blowing.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats will now undoubtedly begin to close ranks behind
Gore as Clinton's heir. But this has a drawback, from Gore's point
of view; it makes it harder for him to be his own man.
</P>
<P>
   He has never offered his party a philosophy, beyond the vaguely
spiritual greenness that used to be his trademark. Nor has he given
much indication of how good a leader he is. He has none of
Clinton's consummate political talent or his ability, on occasion,
to stare down awkward friends.
</P>
<P>
   But the plain fact is that no Democrat (not Gore or Bill Bradley
or Bob Kerrey, or those other time-worn names with a toe in the
water) impresses as much as the man who, by his own folly, has
deliberately made himself smaller than he should be.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the Democrats, how do the Republicans stand?
Since election day, the picture is more confusing. They have
become, and remain, the majority party in the sense that matters:
if America can be said to have a political complexion, this is now
Republican. In the past decade, almost all the social changes that
have swept America have moved it in a Republican direction.
Manufacturing industry, a rich source of Democratic votes through
the labor unions, has given way to the non-unionized service
sector.
</P>
<P>
   Whole regions have moved away, too. As the South has modernized,
abandoning its legacy of segregation, Republicans -- once spurned
as the anti-slavery party -- have not only gained a foothold there,
but have feasted on the region's natural conservatism. The
fastest-growing parts of the country, in California and the Rocky
Mountain West, are also natural Republican territory: gung-ho for
development, prosperous and suburban.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's elections do not alter that. The Republicans have very
slightly lost their grip on Congress, but they still control it.
Their position is even stronger at state level, where they hold 31
(previously 32) of the 50 governorships. This seems to underline
their supremacy well into the future, since it is governors who
will preside over the congressional redistricting that will follow
the census in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   For some years now, too, the more pushy and interesting
political figures have come from the Republican side of the fence.
The party has had momentum; it has had money, and, for a brief
glorious spell, it also had ideas. In September 1994, just before
the last set of mid-term elections brought a Republican landslide,
Newt Gingrich presented his ``Contract with America'': a list of
ten policies which, he promised, would get through the House within
100 days. Amazingly, most of them did, and even got further.
</P>
<P>
   The shell-shocked Democrats found themselves agreeing to
deregulation, devolution of power to the states, the loss of
congressional perks, and the wholesale rearranging both of federal
subsidies to farmers and welfare payments to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, however, nothing of this fervor remained. The
Contract died long ago, and nothing has succeeded it. The
Republicans assumed that Americans backed their revolution, when
the vote of 1994 was really a slap at the Clinton Democrats; and
they were stalled by their own arrogance, which reached its apogee
when they shut down the government in the winter of 1995 rather
than compromise over the budget.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, though they have held their slim majorities, they
have lacked the legislative skill to do much with them against a
Democratic president. As Gingrich told the Washington Post
recently, Republican leaders are still ``learning to govern.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich himself, reviled by the public and almost the victim of
an internal party coup against his speakership in 1997, has still
not recovered, and Tuesday has made it worse. The once-brilliant
leader is now mocked not just for being clumsy over the budget and
allowing Democrats the advantage, but for misreading the popular
mood and calling the election wrong.
</P>
<P>
   There are curious parallels here with the Democrats. The one
Republican who could be called a visionary, whose eyes are fixed on
a future Utopia and how to get there, has been weakened by his own
folly. Gingrich has his batty side, and it is not clear what his
new idea, ``21st-century Reaganism,'' really adds up to, beyond an
assertive foreign policy and lots more computers. But he gave his
party, for a while, a blistering coherence, and that has
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Political pundits think Gingrich, who has a formidable
money-raising machine, may just possibly recast himself and run in
2000; but his congressional troops will be harder to reassemble.
Their shoulder-to-shoulder unity on the various inquiries into the
president's conduct, culminating with the inquiry into impeachment,
looks all the more vindictive because the party is divided on so
much else.
</P>
<P>
   The internationalist Gingrich (and, to a lesser extent, the more
parochial southerners, Trent Lott and Dick Armey, who lead the
Republicans in the Senate and the House) are still bothered by the
wilder elements who came into the House with the landslide of 1994.
These Republicans -- now revelling in the acronym CATs, for
Conservative Action Team, and centered round David McIntosh of
Indiana -- have not forgotten the Contract and, especially, the
moral dimension it was meant to have. In small print at the bottom
of the list were limits on abortion, support for prayer in schools
and -- ever since the appearance of Starr -- a crusade against the
nationwide depravity represented by the president.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's results have been a decided slap in the face for that
crusade. Highly motivated conservative voters were balanced, to say
the least, by highly motivated Democrats. The public, which has
already told pollsters overwhelmingly that it does not want special
prosecutors to be preachers, does not want its politicians to be
preachers, either. Most Americans want abortion to stay legal. Most
prefer, too, to keep intact the wall the constitution has carefully
erected between church and state. And most think their sinning
president should be left alone.
</P>
<P>
   Every Republican nominee for president, down to Bob Dole in
1996, has struggled to incorporate the moralistic wing of the party
into some notional ``big tent'' where all opinions are ostensibly
respected. It is bound to do so, it supposes, because of their
legions of supporters outside Congress. Randy Tate's Christian
Coalition, Gary Bauer's Family Research Council, Jim Dobson's Focus
on the Family, are pressure groups the party hates to alienate,
even if they have nowhere else to go. Every time Dobson threatens
to flounce out of the party and take his people with him (as he
last did in February), the leaders must scramble to soothe him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they know now, for sure, that it is just as dangerous to
pander to these groups. Even throwing tiny bones in their direction
(as when Lott, in June, called homosexuality ``a sin'') gets them
into instant trouble with the great mass of voters who are tolerant
sorts.
</P>
<P>
   There have been strong signs, too, that the more the Republican
Party appears to be led by the nose by the religious right, the
more businessmen become unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   On China policy, for example, corporations were astonished that
the right cared more to make a point against religious persecution
than to secure open trade. It would be a disaster for the party if
business hands stayed in pockets. But the right is now so furious
with the party leaders' mistakes that they will now be more
disruptive than ever.
</P>
<P>
   There is also another problem to face: the cavalier way in which
the Republican Party has ignored or even antagonized the
fast-growing Latino electorate. Latinos, whose self-reliance and
old-fashioned morality would seem to make them natural Republicans,
have been enraged by Republican support for anti-immigrant
proposals, both locally and in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, sensing the drift, began last year to soft-pedal his
party's bids to restrict immigration and end job preferences based
on race. Several Republican candidates started Spanish lessons, and
governors in heavily Latino places (especially the Bush brothers,
George and Jeb, in Texas and Florida) made pitches for the Latino
vote. This worked in both states, with both Bush brothers winning
handsomely on Tuesday; but it made no difference in the most vital
contest, the governor's race in California, where two-thirds of
registered Latino voters are now Democrats. There, the Republican
lost.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Republicans' hubris has come back to haunt them.
They are indeed still learning, and sometimes they learn too late.
Shouting in a vacuum It is strange, but no accident, that most
discussion of the present state of the parties ends up by focusing
on the most disaffected sectors. These are the parts that make the
noise and provide the color against the vapid centrism of everyone
else.
</P>
<P>
   But, with their essentially backward-looking ideas, they also
keep Congress in an ideological log-jam in which little gets done.
If, for different reasons, the parties begin to unite and present
themselves more positively, matters might improve.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the parties have occasionally borrowed useful
ideas from each other and have even managed that American idyll,
bipartisanship. Indeed, the distinctions between the parties have
been blurring for a decade or so. President George Bush's brand of
Republicanism was advertised as ``kinder and gentler,'' caring
about the little man; Clinton's version of the Democratic credo
stressed fiscal responsibility and a certain social
hard-heartedness.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Gingrich eruption inspired, in the end, yet more
cross-dressing. Its apotheosis came in the agreement, last year, to
balance the federal budget; an agreement made easier for both sides
by soaring tax revenues as the economy boomed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this was almost all the last Congress produced. Old partisan
habits meant that, on most issues, the parties took up their
routine positions: in favor of spending the budget surplus on a tax
cut (Republicans), or for using it to save Social Security
(Democrats); against school vouchers (Democrats), or for them
(Republicans).
</P>
<P>
   Policies which require a certain amount of open-mindedness, or
which might be hard to explain in 30-second sound-bites to voters,
seem to sink in bipartisan indifference. This is what happened to
the attempt to reach agreement with the tobacco companies over
lawsuits against them; and it is what happened, almost needless to
say, over campaign-finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Debate did not simply evaporate because Clinton was distracted,
though that did not help. The parties were distracted, too. Their
job -- as they have seen it in recent years -- is not to tease out
policy, no matter how much the think-tanks on both sides ply them
with studies. Their job is to raise money continuously and on a
vast scale to make sure their candidates are kept in, or pushed
into, power.
</P>
<P>
   So, given that this remains their job, whom will the parties
push into power next? The answer is more encouraging than recent
history, with its record of carefully packaged and anodyne
presidential candidates, might suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, iconoclastic governors are the men to watch. Most
presidential campaigns contain a governor or two, and they have
often been the victors in recent years; but the present crop is
different. They have more power than their predecessors, because of
the devolution of social services that followed the 1994 Republican
sweep; and they have more money, because the economic boom has
filled their tax coffers. As it happens, every one of them is a
Republican: and they may offer precisely what the warring party
needs.
</P>
<P>
   The man on whom hopes have come to rest is George Bush, Jr., the
Republican governor of Texas, who was re-elected on Tuesday with 69
percent of the vote. He is a pretty mild version of the breed: a
man who is judged, and who sees himself, less as a great reformer
than a unifier of factions.
</P>
<P>
   But that is good enough. Bush has proved to have tremendous
coat-tails; so tremendous, that the Republicans won every statewide
race. He has a famous name, and he has -- at least on his Texas
showing, all cowboy boots and drawl -- a large dose of that
essential ingredient, charisma. Money pours after him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he is merely the most-marketable tip of Republican talent
from the states and cities. Consider Tommy Thompson, the governor
of Wisconsin, a pioneer both in reforming welfare and streamlining
government services; brother Jeb in Florida, with his new, caring
brand of Republicanism; Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, who has slashed
business taxes; and -- among the mayors -- New York's Rudolph
Giuliani, who has revelled in iconoclasm and showmanship as he has
cut crime and cleaned up the city.
</P>
<P>
   The energy of the Gingrich revolution, which has so notably
drained out of Congress, still survives at state level; and it is
this that has given America much of its present Republican
coloring.
</P>
<P>
   But here lies the irony. Voters overwhelmingly vote for these
men not because they are Republican, but because they get things
done. If a governor cuts taxes, draws investment and makes the
schools better, it does not matter what his affiliation is, just as
it does not matter what his race is. These men in their domains --
unlike the self-proclaimed ``free spirits'' among the congressional
candidates, who tend slavishly to vote with their party once they
get to Washington -- can seize or borrow any policy they choose,
pursue any group of voters they think useful, and have no
philosophy at all except what they like and what works. Their
wholehearted pragmatism also means that they either have little
time for the party's more moralistic policies, or give them a
gentler cast.
</P>
<P>
   This independence can cause occasional heartburn to the party
power-brokers. They do not know quite what these local Republicans
are up to, and are clearly afraid that on some issues, such as
education reform, they are getting way ahead of them.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the Republican governors have not forgotten how
the congressional party has blown hot and cold on block grants to
the states to fund social services. But the devolution of power to
the states is not to be reversed, unless a deep recession drives
the governors back into Washington's arms.
</P>
<P>
   The party therefore has to make an uncharacteristic leap of
faith: it can have its highly attractive Mr. Fixit candidates,
while accepting that they appeal directly to the voters' dislike of
partisanship and the party machines. But here an intriguing paradox
emerges. That same Mr. Fixit, if he can get past residual
suspicions, may end up uniting his disparate party behind him as he
has previously united his state. A George Bush, indifferent as he
may appear to political labels, makes his party stronger.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge, now that the elections have suggested greater
cohesion among both Democrats and Republicans, will be for stronger
parties to produce strong agendas and productive ideas. Eyes are
turning eagerly to the prospect of Bush v Gore: the new outsider
and the old insider, two potential soothers of party factions who
lead their rivals by miles -- but who are not noted for their
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   All that remains, if America is to enter the 21st century with a
two-party system that actually works, is for them to find the ideas
that will inspire their factions to unite rather than fight.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Esteemed members of the American Theater Wing,
devoted patrons of the Drama League, lunchtime habitues of Sardi's,
lend me your ears! Sandra Bernhard has alighted in our sacred
midtown midst and, well, she is showing absolutely no respect!
</P>
<P>
   Oh, how she picks, picks, picks! The vicious jibes at the
expense of ``The Scarlet Pimpernel''! The nasty little digs at
``Footloose''!
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' she announces contemptuously from Broadway's epicenter,
the stage of the Booth Theater, her head swaying in mock ecstasy,
her lips curled in a congenital sneer. ``This scene rocks!''
</P>
<P>
   Simmer down now, people. She's a hipster-provocateur, all right,
and if her breaches of common courtesy set your teeth on edge, I
plead with you, read no further. (The titans she makes sport of!
Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise. Alanis Morissette. Liza. Courtney
Love. Of all the nerve!) If, on the other hand, you're the
dastardly type who craves a little mouthwatering after-dinner
vitriol, who responds to a voice that calls forth your inner wild
child, who's fantasized about taking a trip to the dark side of
People magazine, then by all means, promptly pay a visit to Ms.
Bernhard's scathing fun house.
</P>
<P>
   There are no excuses for the outrages she commits in her
100-minute show, ``I'm Still Here ... Damn It!,'' which opened
Thursday night at the Booth for a limited run. And that's what
makes it such a guilty pleasure. (The things she says about Mariah
Carey! The denigration of Fiona Apple!) Ms. Bernhard may take
things all the way to the edge _ this is foul-mouthed comedy as an
extreme sport _ and even demonstrate a cruel streak, as in her
devastating impersonation of a vulnerable Jennifer Jason Leigh,
mumbling the words to ``Cabaret.'' Yet through her fearless
self-exposure, accentuated by her amazing get-ups, including a
see-through gown that clings to her slinky cheetah's frame, she has
the knack of making you an accomplice to her radical naughtiness,
as she turns wickedness into a grotesque thrill, a joyful release.
</P>
<P>
   The production is a shortened and revised version of her hit
one-woman show last season at the Westbeth Theater Center in
Greenwich Village. It is an eclectic evening in which, aside from
trashing fellow celebrities, she tells a few sentimental anecdotes,
reads a few poems and sings, with surprising depth and power, a few
original songs and rock classics, like ``Dream On'' by Aerosmith
and Jim Weatherly's ``Midnight Train to Georgia.'' Given the fans
she has acquired, through her appearances on ``Roseanne'' and her
performances in a previous off-Broadway show and as a demented fan
in Martin Scorsese's offbeat 1983 film, ``The King of Comedy,'' Ms.
Bernhard has earned her platform on Shubert Alley, even if she
professes ambivalence about it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as she makes plain, the distance she's traveled with
``I'm Still Here'' can't be measured in stops on the subway. At
times, you do need to have scored something close to a perfect 1600
on your HATs _ the Hipness Aptitude Test _ to get all the fashion
and music and lesbian references to things like Manolo Blahnik
shoes, the singer Ann Wilson and obscure downtown clubs. Smartly,
Ms. Bernhard never stops to explain herself _ ``Honey, I can't hold
your hand here,'' is the show's unspoken motto _ and anyway,
compiling an encyclopedia of in-ness is her obsession; it needn't
be yours.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The supercharged Ms. Bernhard seems like the kind of person to
whom you'd want to give a very wide berth on a bad day, but in
performance, a bad day is what you hope for. No one, but no one,
does high dudgeon quite the way she does; high heat is where she
really cooks. The best moments of ``I'm Still Here,'' even at its
most esoteric, are recited in ire. Invariably, what gets her going
is some injustice in the glossy worlds of the media and show
business, as in her parody song ``On the Runway,'' satirizing the
grief expressed by the supermodel community over the murder of
Gianni Versace, or her diatribe on the failings of today's young
female rock stars, or her pique at a recent Newsweek cover
depicting a man and a woman who have renounced their homosexuality
and married.
</P>
<P>
   So enter Ms. Bernhard's temporary house of worship _ the stage
is serenely bedecked in dangling votive candles _ and quake merrily
as she dismantles Linda Evangelista, snipes at Caller ID, inveighs
against Cher. ``I'm Still Here'' is the perfect experience for the
post-election season; it makes you choose sides. Me, I'd follow
Sandra all the way to the White House. Or at least as far as the
House of Gucci.

`LIVING OUT LOUD' SPEAKS TOO QUIETLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TODD CAMP 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Writer/director Richard LaGravenese's excruciating examination
of loneliness in the '90s, ``Living Out Loud,'' might be so
on-target that you can't help but leave more depressed than its
onscreen characters started off. Then again, it might just be
really boring.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt that LaGravenese is a talented screenwriter _
his knack for clever banter (''The Ref'') and intellectual subject
matter (''The Fisher King'') surface periodically in ``Loud,''
which draws inspiration largely from two short stories by Anton
Chekhov. Unfortunately, under his own direction, LaGravenese's
words fall flat and in some cases, come off as overblown.
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly not Holly Hunter's fault. She acts up a storm as
a doctor's wife forced to rediscover her own identity when her
husband abandons her for a younger woman.
</P>
<P>
   She retreats inside herself, listening to jazz CDs in her ritzy
co-op and dining on Chinese delivery with side dishes of self-pity.
When she finally ventures out to see her favorite singer perform at
a local club, the experience starts off disastrously, making her
feel even more ignored and alone than before. It's all beautifully
realized in Hunter's vivid imagination _ dreaming of things she
might have said or done, only to come crashing back to the dull
disappointment of reality.
</P>
<P>
   It's only after a chance encounter of mistaken identity in the
club's back room that Hunter banishes her own sense of invisibility
and begins to discover those unseen souls going through life around
her.
</P>
<P>
   Her first find is Danny DeVito, a divorced gambling debtor
struggling to makes ends meet in a variety of jobs, including one
as an elevator operator in Hunter's building.
</P>
<P>
   Her newfound attention for him prompts an odd friendship between
the two _ a relationship that's destined to remain platonic despite
DeVito's dreams.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not really about him. The best bits of ``Loud'' are
when Hunter's lonely life takes center stage _ her experience with
a masseur is both hilarious and sexy, as is a ``Basic
Instinct''-style dance sequence in a lesbian bar.
</P>
<P>
   But if it weren't for Hunter's powerhouse persona, ``Living Out
Loud'' would be a quiet, lonely exercise in futility. DeVito plays
his lovable schlub self as competently as always, and Queen Latifah
is convincing as a local jazz diva whom Hunter befriends after
emerging from her lonely shell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Loud'' scores some points for not wrapping up things nicely
with an everybody-gets-somebody ending, but not enough to make it
worth wading through for anyone other than Holly Hunter devotees.

MIND OVER EVEN THESE SEXY `MANNERS'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a burst of irony that's a little too obvious, ``Bad Manners''
begins with a couple zooming down the road as Elvis Costello belts
``(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love and Understanding.'' It's a
sign of the movie's indirectness; if it wanted to be direct, the
song would have been John Lennon's ``Mind Games.''
</P>
<P>
   Mind games are what the characters in this stagy drama play with
one another _ and what the movie plays with the audience. The
movie's two acts each center on a mystery, each of which is
compounded by the characters' tendency to jump to conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The cruising couple are Matt and Kim (Saul Rubinek and Caroleen
Feeney). He's a schlubby musicologist who's convinced that God has
spoken to him through a piece of ``found'' music; she's a younger
computer whiz who has a brazenly forthright manner and a taste for
danger _ you can tell by the way she obscures Matt's vision when
he's driving. She brings that taste to the home of Wes and Nancy
Westlund, a midlife-crisis-steeped academic couple played by David
Strathairn and Bonnie Bedelia. Matt is Nancy's ex-boyfriend, and a
whisper of attraction still lingers. Putting up your ex-lover for a
weekend _ looks like Kim's not the only one with a taste for
danger.
</P>
<P>
   Kim has such a chip on her shoulder that you have to wonder why.
But it does give us reason to side with Wes when he misplaces $50,
and he immediately suspects Kim, who winds up also missing $50 and
immediately suspects her hosts. And from there, things escalate.
</P>
<P>
   When you're watching a talky drama like this one, you'd better
hope that the characters onscreen are at least marginally
interesting, and for a long time, they aren't. But the movie's
first act has just enough incendiary potential to keep you
watching, and its second act provides just enough payoff to reward
your patience. It doesn't, however, leave you unnerved or gasping,
but rather more mildly bemused.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad, because it's a gem of a cast, and they all give
terrific performances _ especially Feeney, who displays the same
sort of dare-you-to-knock-this-off feistiness and aggressive
sexiness that turned Parker Posey and Catherine Keener into
indie-film stars. David Gilman's script provides them all with
sharp dialogue and show-stopping speeches, but the movie ends up
feeling like an interesting exercise rather than a verbally
visceral experience.

NFL MATCHUPS: WEEK 10 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; GAME OF THE WEEK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo (5-3) vs. Jets (5-3)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Bills (6) _ Consecutive victories vs. Jets; Jets (3-0)
_ Divisional record.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: It was unlikely at the season's start to believe that
this game at this juncture in the season would decide which team
remains in first place in the AFC East division. But that is what
is at stake. And more. For both teams, it is an attempt to keep a
good and surprising thing going. Both teams have been lifted by
stirring quarterback play from backups, Doug Flutie for Buffalo and
Vinny Testaverde for the Jets. Both feature big-play running backs
(Antowain Smith for Buffalo and Curtis Martin for the Jets) and
both employ defenses that have begun to sustain for four quarters.
It is special teams where the Jets make their mark in this battle.
Watch LeShon Johnson turn the game the Jets way with big returns.
The kicking game and field position give the Jets the edge. Jets,
23-20.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SUNDAY 1 P.M. GAMES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta (6-2) vs. New England (5-3)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: (862) Anderson rushing yards; Patriots (580) Edwards
rushing yards.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Jamal Anderson rushed for 172 yards and 3 touchdowns
against the Rams on last Sunday and he is enjoying a Pro-bowl type
season. He hits holes hard and keeps churning _ a lot like
Patriots' rookie back Robert Edwards. The Falcons are 6-2 for the
first time in club history and they rely on quarterback Chris
Chandler's prime decision making, on Anderson's running and
controlling the clock and on a defense that swarms to the ball. But
the Patriots have a bit more big-play people and deep-strike attack
and that swings this game in their favor. New England is 13-5 (a
.772 winning percentage) in November games since 1994. They add to
that total. Patriots, 21-14.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati (2-6) vs. Jacksonville (6-2)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Bengals (6) _ League's fewest turnovers; Jaguars
(17-2) _ Record at home in last 19.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Jacksonville hit its stride last week, thumping
Baltimore, 45-19, in a road game. Now they return home where they
are fearless and usually execute in exacting fashion. Cincinnati is
a team that does some big things right and little things wrong. And
it costs them dearly. The Bengals not only have committed the
fewest turnovers in the league but they also have committed the
fewest penalties (40). That often means a team is clicking, but not
in the Bengals' case. They came close to upsetting Denver last
Sunday, losing by 33-26 late in the game. They have played the
Jaguars six times total and each game has been decided by 8 or
fewer points. Not this one. Jaguars, 34-14.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit (2-6) vs. Philadelphia (1-7)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Lions (99) Sanders career rushing TDs; Eagles (-10) _
Turnover differential.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Here are two clubs spinning and toiling in mediocrity.
For Detroit, the biggest woe has been allowing too many big plays.
For the Eagles it is that and much more. The last time the Lions
played in Philadelphia was in a 1995 wild card playoff game, won by
the Eagles, 58-37. It was the highest scoring game in playoff
history. Neither of these current editions can match that. Sanders,
who with a rushing touchdown can earn the 100th of his career,
becoming the sixth player in league history to achieve that feat,
at least makes this struggle bearable. Lions, 17-14.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis (1-7) vs. Miami (5-3)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Colts (1) Sack allowed. in last 4 games. Dolphins
(4-0) Home record.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Did you know that Colts back Marshall Faulk is the only
player in the league with at least 500 rushing yards and 500
receiving yards? Those kind of achievements are often lost when
your team is 1-7. The Dolphins won at Indianapolis, 24-15, in the
season opener for both teams and in that game Dolphins' cornerback
Terrell Buckley intercepted two passes and returned one for a
touchdown. Expect more Miami thefts. The Dolphins will blitz
frequently against rookie quarterback Peyton Manning. Miami is
fuming after being foiled at Buffalo on last Sunday. It makes
amends. Dolphins, 33-9.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans (4-4) vs. Minnesota (7-1)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Saints (17) Takeaways. Vikings (76) Ed McDaniel
tackles.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: The Vikings can hit you hard for big gains that are
crushing. They lead the league with nine 40-yard touchdowns from
scrimmage (6 rushing and 3 passing). Robert Smith has produced
touchdown runs of 74, 67 and 57 yards. Receiver Randy Moss averages
19.1 yards per catch. The Saints average only 281.0 yards per game
on offense but Minnesota averages 375.8 yards. New Orleans will
have a difficult time keeping pace. No, make that a nearly
impossible time. Vikings, 44-14.
</P>
<P>
   Giants (3-5) vs. Dallas (5-3)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Giants (34) Sacks, most in league; Cowboys (15.9) _
Sanders punt return average.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Dallas won the first meeting, 31-7, in a Monday night
game on Sept. 21 where Deion Sanders returned a punt for a
touchdown and where the Giants fell all over themselves all night
long. Dallas can make it a sweep over the Giants and strengthen its
hold on the NFC East division. Dallas believes it can contain the
Giants because it is so familiar with the Giants offensive attack.
It's pretty simple. Stuff the run. No consistent deep threat
established, so no worry there. Just play it basic and attack. It
worked last time. Works again. Cowboys, 24-10.
</P>
<P>
   Raiders (6-2) vs. Baltimore (2-6)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Raiders (13) _ Interceptions; Ravens (8.5) Robert
McCrary sacks.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: This is crunch time for the Ravens who are watching a
season of high hopes tumble into doom and gloom. They are better
than this. Injuries and inconsistency at quarterback have hurt. A
sputtering offense has ensued. And Ted Marchibroda, the Ravens head
coach, is being saddled with the blame. Fair or not, he has to get
his team in gear and produce a strong showing in the season's
second half to have any chance to keep his job. And he is matched
against a Raiders coaching staff and team that is building
confidence and attempting to eventually match an 8-2 start, its
best since 1995. The Ravens surprise. Ravens, 22-17.
</P>
<P>
   Rams (2-6) vs. Chicago (3-5)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Rams (64.2) _ Tony Banks' QB rating; Bears (9) _
Fumbles recovered.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: The Rams are in trouble, hammered by the Falcons,
37-15, last Sunday and with as much trouble off the field as on it.
Leadership is lacking within the club and unity suffers. The Bears
have made wonderful strides and keep it going. It finds that the
Rams won't put up much fight once they get down. And they get down
early in this game. Chicago has averaged 117.3 rushing yards in its
three victories and gets more than that against a defense that
overall allows 312.5 yards per game. Bears, 20-16.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SUNDAY 4 P.M. GAMES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Carolina (1-7) vs. San Francisco (6-2)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Panthers (93.0) Beuerlein QB rating. 49ers (21) Young
TD passes.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: The 49ers come home to lick their wounds after being
roasted at Green Bay and home is where their healing is. The 49ers
are 11-0 at 3-Com Park under head coach Steve Mariucci. San
Francisco will find that moving the ball against the Panthers'
defense will be a lot easier than against Green Bay's. Quarterback
Steve Young to receiver Jerry Rice is now the league's all-time
most frequent touchdown passing duo with 80. That is a good place
for the 49ers to start in beating the Panthers. From there, watch
back Garrison Hearst, who rushed for 219 yards in a game vs.
Carolina last season. Hearst won't get that but he'll get plenty.
49ers, 31-6.
</P>
<P>
   Washington (1-7) vs. Arizona (4-4)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Redskins (40.9) _ Turk's net punting average;
Cardinals (25) Takeaways.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Hail to the Redskins! They finally won a game, beating
the Giants last Sunday, and now look for another victory in their
first meeting against this divisional rival. Too bad. The streak
stops at one. The Cardinals appear the last hope of catching Dallas
in this stumbling division and they won't let the Redskins stand in
the way. Defensive end Simeon Rice is soaring with 2 sacks and 2
fumble recoveries in his past three games. He proves a bundle for
Washington to defend. The Cardinals made 20 takeaways and 14 fumble
recoveries in 1997. Already they have 25 and 14. They add to that
total in this matchup. Cardinals, 26-17.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City (4-4) vs. Seattle (4-4)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Chiefs (7) _ TD passes allowed; Seahawks (6) _ Return
TDs.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: Kansas City has won seven straight over Seattle but it
will be difficult to make it eight. The Chiefs have trouble running
the ball and scoring in the Red Zone. It beat Seattle by 17-6 on
Oct. 4 in a rain-soaked game played on a sloppy, muddy field, but
no such problems in the Kingdome. Seattle is an underachieving team
but rights itself for this game. And, finally, snaps the Kansas
City string. Watch receiver Joey Galloway. He has never earned a
100-yard receiving game vs. the Chiefs. That changes here. So does
the entire Chiefs season. Seahawks, 24-16.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego (3-5) vs. Denver (8-0)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: (-10) _ Turnover differential. Broncos (20) _
Consecutive home victories.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: A team can't turn the ball over against Denver and have
any chance. The Broncos are too good. Turnovers help make them
nearly unstoppable. San Diego makes too many turnovers. It has the
No.-l-rated defense in the league, allowing an average of only
249.6 yards per game, but has too little to show for it. Ryan Leaf
said he did not understand the big deal about the Arrowhead Stadium
crowd before his first visit to Kansas City and then went there and
the crowd was deafening and he flopped. No such comments from Leaf
about Denver's Mile High Stadium. It will be a memorable visit for
Leaf _ for all of the wrong reasons. Broncos, 37-17.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SUNDAY NIGHT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee (4-4) vs. Tampa Bay (4-4)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Oilers (3-1) _ In last 4 games. Buccaneers (4-0) _
Home record.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: This could be the best game of the day. These two teams
are meshing now and both have excellent chances to make the
playoffs. Tennessee is 12-5 when Eddie George rushes for 100 yards
and he rushed for 153 yards vs. Pittsburgh. The Oilers scored 41
points vs. Pittsburgh. They look ready to break out but must do so
against a defense led by Warren Sapp that is the NFC's best vs. the
run, allowing 81.5 rushing yards per game. Trent Dilfer, the Bucs'
quarterback, has six touchdown passes and five interceptions but is
beginning to settle in. Great for the Bucs that he peeks in the
season's second half rather than the first. This is a major hurdle
for Tampa Bay, getting them over .500. Buccaneers, 17-10.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MONDAY NIGHT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay (6-2) vs. Pittsburgh (5-3)
</P>
<P>
   KEY STAT: Packers (87.8) _ Average rushing yards allowed.
Steelers (11-3) _ Coach Bill Cowher's Monday Night Football record.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENT: This game will tell us plenty about Kordell Stewart and
the Pittsburgh offense, particularly the passing game. Facing the
Packers' stout defense and pass rush and paired against Brett
Favre, Stewart and his receivers must play their best game thus far
this season to topple Green Bay. It likely won't happen. Look for
Favre to use a moving pocket, rolling right and left to buy extra
time for big plays. Look for back Travis Jervey to break long runs.
Look for a Packers victory and for the wolves to howl on Stewart
and the Steelers. It could get ugly. Packers, 26-20.

 &HT;    URBAN SPRAWL BECOMING A MAINSTREAM POLITICAL ISSUE
 &HT;    460&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Dismay over unbridled development has emerged as a
mainstream political issue, with voters nationwide signaling their
frustration with suburban sprawl, advocates of ``smart growth''
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is clearly an issue that is rising very dramatically on
the public agenda throughout the country,'' Richard Moe, president
of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, declared at a
meeting of activists to review the results of Tuesday's election.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen states voted on more than 200 state and local
initiatives to protect and preserve parks, open space, farmland,
historic buildings and watersheds. Nearly 70 percent of them were
approved, according to State Resource Strategies, a Washington
consulting firm that tracks growth issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters care a lot about this issue and they're willing to show
up at the ballot box and prove it,'' said Phyllis Myers, the firm's
president.
</P>
<P>
   More important, said Moe, anti-sprawl voters are now ``willing
to pay'' for measures that promote smart growth, added Moe. The
initiatives approved Tuesday propose spending $7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the clash of developers with preservationists and
environmentalists has intensified as burgeoning cities and suburbs
have required more land for homes, highways and shopping centers.
Since 1970, more than 19 million acres of once-rural lands have
been urbanized, according to the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the political fight over sprawl has been waged
mostly on the fringes. But with an increasing number of ballot
initiatives, the issue ``is now in the mainstream'' of American
politics, said Moe.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Vice President Al Gore has made several
speeches testing anti-sprawl themes, apparently intended to appeal
to voters in California and other Western states where development
threatens to outstrip resources and public services.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's office is reviewing federal housing, transportation and
tax policies to determine whether they promote urban sprawl. The
General Accounting Office, the watchdog arm of Congress, is
conducting a similar review, its report expected next spring.
</P>
<P>
   The best example is the densely populated state of New Jersey,
where two-thirds of the voters approved a proposal to spend $1
billion over the next 10 years to preserve farm and forest land.
The proposal, which will require some new tax hikes at the local
level, was advanced by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, a Republican
who came to office in 1994 on the strength of promises to cut
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Jersey invented sprawl, and now it is leading the country
in growth management,'' said Barbara Lawrence, president of New
Jersey Future, a nonprofit organization that helped to spearhead
the New Jersey initiative.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The biggest Election Day disappointment to the anti-sprawl
activists was the defeat of a proposal in Georgia that would have
raised real estate transfer taxes over four years to generate $30
million annually for the state's Land, Water, Wildlife and
Recreation Heritage Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``Georgia caught us by surprise,'' said Moe.
</P>
<P>
   Another major disappointment occurred in California, where San
Diego voters soundly rejected a measure to set aside 600,000 acres
of farmland. The measure was opposed by farmers.
</P>
<P>
   But a major victory on par with New Jersey was Florida's
approval of a constitutional amendment to issue bonds to finance
the state's acquisition of open land and to protect wildlife
habitats, parks, beaches and archeological sites.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Snow will accumulate on the high Plains from western Nebraska to
the western Dakotas and along the Front Range of the Rockies from
northern Colorado to Montana as a developing low pressure system
draws moist air from the southeast up the sloping terrain.
Moreover, moist air will cool on ascent, setting the stage for
snowfalls of 6 inches or more in some areas, with the heaviest snow
falling mainly on the highest east-facing slopes.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, scattered showers and spotty drizzle will dampen
the region from west Texas to western Kansas. Isolated
thunderstorms may develop later in the day across south Texas as
moist air from the Gulf of Mexico increases over the region.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, coastal rains and mountain snows will develop in the
Pacific Northwest from northern California to western Washington as
a cold, upper-level low pressure system arrives from the Gulf of
Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   With the remnants of Tropical Storm Mitch racing northeast
across the Atlantic Friday, waterlogged areas in south Florida,
which were deluged by as much as 8 inches of rain from Wednesday to
early Thursday, will rapidly dry out under ample sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly cloudy, chilly weather will persist from the Great Lakes
to the Appalachians Friday as Canadian air is moistened in transit
across tepid waters and then forced to rise over land. Splotches of
light snow or drizzle will prevail downwind of the southern and
eastern shores. Winds from the northwest will dry on descent from
the mountains, bringing partial sunshine to parts of the Northeast
Seaboard.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: SEA OF CLOUDS
</P>
<P>
   Low clouds hovered over much of the Great Lakes region Thursday.
Cumulatively, the Great Lakes act like an inland sea during the
cold season, helping to produce clouds downwind of eastern and
southern shores whenever invading Canadian air is moistened during
transit over relatively warm waters. On Friday, low clouds will
persist over much of the Great Lakes region, particularly the
eastern Great Lakes, as cold air continues to filter south. In
addition, broken bands of snow showers and snow flurries will
develop, one of the first installments in the upcoming season of
lake-effect snows.

<P>
   Yes, he has done it again. You can try to put the man down, load
him with inquiries, show him to be a liar and a philanderer, push
him into public apologies -- and still he comes back laughing.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since 1822, the party of a Democratic
president in his sixth year in office has picked up seats in the
House of Representatives. The Democrats gained two governorships,
too, and lost no ground in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   All across the country, the people most motivated to vote were
not Revolted Republicans but Democrats who, for months, had been
trying to tell anyone who would listen that they liked Bill Clinton
and intended to stick with him.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, putting a brave face on these results, can say that
the status quo ante is more or less preserved. In Congress, the
Democrats have not retaken anything; for the first time in 70
years, Republicans have kept control of both chambers for three
consecutive elections. In the governorships, Republicans still
control most states (and therefore, crucially, the congressional
redistricting that will follow the census in 2000).
</P>
<P>
   They can point out -- as is true -- that stirring Democratic
victories like those of Gray Davis in the California governor's
race, or Charles Schumer in the Senate race in New York, can be
mostly attributed to local gripes and aspirations. They can insist
-- as is also true -- that turnout was much as usual, 37 percent of
the electorate, meaning that almost two-thirds offered no
particular opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the unavoidable message from these results is that the
Republicans have not been given the mandate they hoped they would
get to proceed with their impeachment inquiry into the president's
conduct. When all the local factors are factored out, the message
is clear: lay off.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the publication of the Starr report, the
possibilities of a popular backlash in favor of Clinton had been
growing. His lowest point, in retrospect, was the non-apology to
the nation on Aug. 17. After that, all trends were subtly upward.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans had loathed Kenneth Starr, the special
prosecutor, from the outset. Even those, like this newspaper, who
supported his inquiries, thought his powers to probe every corner
of the president's life were excessive beyond the cause of justice.
</P>
<P>
   The public, as polls consistently showed, went much further than
this. They did not think a president should be removed either for
adultery, or for lying about sex in public and in a civil lawsuit;
and they thought the press (hardly an institution glowing with
virtue) was deeply hypocritical to suggest that he should.
</P>
<P>
   On top of this fundamental sentiment came the growing perception
of unfairness. The public did not like the way that the Starr
report was rushed out, with the president given no time to peruse
it first. They hated the airing of the videotape of Clinton's
testimony to the grand jury, the publication of Linda Tripp's and
Monica Lewinsky's bizarrely rambling conversations, the lopsided
vote in favor of the impeachment inquiry. Everything screamed
``Witchhunt.''
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton did impressive things -- outmaneuvring the
Republicans on the budget, brokering the Middle East peace talks --
the papers seemed to report them churlishly, still hoping for more
sex.
</P>
<P>
   Since the chattering classes in Washington were determined to
break this man, a fair number of Democratic voters round the
country -- especially, as it turned out, women, Latinos and blacks,
groups ever-sensitive to unfairness -- angrily determined to save
him.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans were well aware of this. Every step toward the
impeachment inquiry was accompanied by agonizing over how the
public would take it. During the campaign, Republicans avoided the
Lewinsky matter until the very last week. Their commercials, when
at last they appeared, were subtle in the extreme, never mentioning
the scandal overtly and airing only in districts that were full of
angry Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, on Wednesday morning, even that much milking of
the scandal seemed to have been a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   So what now? The impeachment inquiry is already under way in
Congress; on Nov. 16, the full Judiciary Committee of the House
will begin formal deliberations into whether Clinton committed
perjury or obstructed justice to conceal his affair with Miss
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the election, however, members were hoping the
inquiry could be short, with a limited list of witnesses, and that
a vote on whether to proceed to impeachment could be taken quickly
before the new Congress convenes in January.
</P>
<P>
   They will want to be all the quicker now, since the new Congress
will have a slightly more Democratic complexion, and the public
mood is so clearly against them. Their very haste suggests a
growing embarrassment: lumbered with this ungainly process, they
too would probably like to be rid of it and to settle for some
swift, simple reprimand, such as censure.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to rush would be a mistake. Having decided on this laborious
process, Republicans must treat it seriously, or further damage
both themselves and the rule of law. If they believed that they had
grounds for an inquiry, it should be a thorough one, for this
election has no effect on those grounds. If they thought they had a
case to make, they have to make it now all the more persuasively.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that, after all, nothing impeachable is found; but,
against all their populist vote-catching instincts, they must not
opt for a short-circuit.
</P>
<P>
   The next political year, with the presidential race of 2000
looming ever-larger in everyone's minds, will not be as the pundits
expected. Instead of a limping president keeping his distance from
a demoralized Democratic Party, there may well be a re-energized
leader with his troops more or less united -- both behind him and
behind his heir-apparent, Al Gore -- in sympathy and defiance.
</P>
<P>
   And instead of a comfortable Republican ascendancy, in
Washington and outside it, there will be a party watching the polls
with trepidation.
</P>
<P>
   Could anyone have predicted it? One man, at least: the
Incredible Rebounding President, whose career will leave in the
history books a trail inscribed in rubber.

<P>
   Yes, he has done it again. You can try to put the man down, load
him with inquiries, show him to be a liar and a philanderer, push
him into public apologies -- and still he comes back laughing.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since 1822, the party of a Democratic
president in his sixth year in office has picked up seats in the
House of Representatives. The Democrats gained two governorships,
too, and lost no ground in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   All across the country, the people most motivated to vote were
not Revolted Republicans but Democrats who, for months, had been
trying to tell anyone who would listen that they liked Bill Clinton
and intended to stick with him.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, putting a brave face on these results, can say that
the status quo ante is more or less preserved. In Congress, the
Democrats have not retaken anything; for the first time in 70
years, Republicans have kept control of both chambers for three
consecutive elections. In the governorships, Republicans still
control most states (and therefore, crucially, the congressional
redistricting that will follow the census in 2000).
</P>
<P>
   They can point out -- as is true -- that stirring Democratic
victories like those of Gray Davis in the California governor's
race, or Charles Schumer in the Senate race in New York, can be
mostly attributed to local gripes and aspirations. They can insist
-- as is also true -- that turnout was much as usual, 37 percent of
the electorate, meaning that almost two-thirds offered no
particular opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the unavoidable message from these results is that the
Republicans have not been given the mandate they hoped they would
get to proceed with their impeachment inquiry into the president's
conduct. When all the local factors are factored out, the message
is clear: lay off.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the publication of the Starr report, the
possibilities of a popular backlash in favor of Clinton had been
growing. His lowest point, in retrospect, was the non-apology to

   BUSH BROTHERS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ One calls himself a compassionate
conservative. The other says he's a multicultural Republican.
Whatever it's called, the Bush brothers may have found a winning
formula for Republicans. As GOP leaders assessed damage in
congressional races, some looked South for clues to the party's
future. The impressive victories by Gov. George W. Bush in Texas
and Gov.-elect Jeb Bush in Florida were among the few bright spots
in an election filled with Republican disappointments. By RON
HUTCHESON. Story has moved in ``p'' political category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VENTURA-GOVERNOR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Former pro wrestler Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura has won
the biggest bout yet for Ross Perot's Reform Party, raging out of
the far corner to capture the Minnesota Governor's Mansion and
leaving the nation blinking in disbelief. By BARRY SHLACHTER. Story
has moved in ``p'' political category. &QL;

   L I F E S T Y L E &QL;

<P>
   ANDERSON-COLUMN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Everyone is worried about the Y2K problem, the
computer crisis of the new millennium. But we have even more
pressing issues to address. Just listen to our children in their
like-new, teen-age, cynical bodies. Listen to the people around
you. Hear the anger. Hear their emotional pots boil as their lids
prepare to blow. Listen to your heart. Does it growl? Does it purr?
Does it speak? Are you sure? By MONICA ANDERSON. Story has moved in
``l'' lifestyle category. &QL;

<P>
   WOLFE-NEW BOOK &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Usually, when publishers claim that
soon-to-be-published books are among the finest ever written, the
hype far exceeds the quality of the writing. But Tom Wolfe's ``A
Man in Full'' is every bit as good as Farrar, Straus and Giroux has
claimed; this novel, which will be available in bookstores on
Friday, establishes Wolfe as one of America's all-time great
authors _ maybe even the best. By JEFF GUINN. Story has moved in
``e'' entertainment category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FILM-VELVET GOLDMINE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ I'm not sure if what you hear in writer/director Todd
Haynes' new picture, ``Velvet Goldmine,'' is the sound of the
picture trying to force down more than it can chew, but there
aren't many rock 'n' roll movies like it. I can't think of another
one that seeks to evoke the presence of Oscar Wilde while trying to
compare the glam-rock London of the early 1970s to Weimar Republic
Berlin. By ELVIS MITCHELL. Story will move in ``e'' entertainment
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FILM-THE SIEGE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Audiences caught up in the trailer for ``The Siege,''
a political suspense thriller by director Edward Zwick, are thrown
for a loop when Bruce Willis pops up as an Army general. In fact,
you could be injured by the projectile guffawing that erupts when
popcorn begins flying out of startled mouths. By ELVIS MITCHELL.
Story will move in ``e'' entertainment category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FILM-BAD MANNERS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ In a burst of irony that's a little too obvious, ``Bad
Manners'' begins with a couple zooming down the road as Elvis
Costello belts ``(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love and
Understanding.'' It's a sign of the movie's indirectness; if it
wanted to be direct, the song would have been John Lennon's ``Mind
Games.'' By ROBERT PHILPOT. Story has moved in ``e'' entertainment
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FILM-LIVING OUT LOUD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Writer/director Richard LaGravenese's excruciating
examination of loneliness in the '90s, ``Living Out Loud,'' might
be so on-target that you can't help but leave more depressed than
its onscreen characters started off. Then again, it might just be
really boring. By TODD CAMP. Story has moved in ``e'' entertainment
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FILM-KISS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ ``Kiss of a Stranger'' is an ``erotic thriller'' that
follows all the conventions of the genre _ except that somehow, it
got theatrical play. As the tired plot, the familiar faces who've
seen better days, and the obligatory nudity unfold, you feel like
going up to the projection booth to see if there's a video box
lying around. By ROBERT PHILPOT. Story has moved in ``e''
entertainment category. &QL;

   ECONOMY-TEXAS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Is the economic party over? Not yet,
according to a report released Wednesday by the Federal Reserve,
which described the national and regional economy as growing _
albeit more slowly. Manufacturing and construction remain high,
although there are signs of softening. Retail sales, while lower
than hoped, are not creating high inventories. And labor markets
remain tight, but not enough to push up wages. In Texas, overall
conditions are much the same: The economy is still strong, but it's
backing off, as consumers appear more cautious, the Fed's Beige
Book says. By MITCHELL SCHNURMAN. Story has moved in ``f''
financial category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BIZ-BOOKS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Hostile takeovers. Highly leveraged buyouts. Poison
pills. The vernacular of management buyouts of companies in the
1980s had a distinctively negative tone. Congress held multiple
hearings, the business press wrote unfavorable articles, union
leaders screamed and journalists wrote books with such titles as
``Barbarians at the Gate.'' But were LBOs really bad for American
business? By TERESA MCUSIC. Story has moved in ``f'' financial
category. &QL;

POTHOLES-ARIZONA (Phoenix) - Phoenix ranks second on a new survey
of American cities whose freeways are in the greatest state of
disrepair. Highways elsewhere in Arizona aren't so great, either,
according to the report by an advocacy group that earlier this year
ranked Phoenix's streets among the most dangerous in the nation. By
MARY JO PITZL. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
LANGUAGE-CDROM (Phoenix) - It's not enough to know the pencil
belonging to Pepe is blue. On a new series of learn-a-language
CD-ROMs, you'd better have your accent and pronunciation correct as
well. The Tell me More private tutor, scolds users out of gringo
accents. It's made by French-based Auralog S.A., which just set up
its U.S. office in Phoenix in time for its recent product launch.
By REBECCA ROLWING. Story moved in the ``F'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
ONLINE-TRAVEL (Undated) - They're the window shoppers of the online
world, and they're giving the Internet travel industry fits. Maybe
you're one of them _ a traveler who checks out the online travel
agencies in search of a low fare or hotel bargain but never clicks
the ``Buy now'' button. By DAWN GILBERTSON. Story will moved in the
``F'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MONTINI-COLUMN (Undated) - There is no tougher day on a newspaper
hack than the first Wednesday in November. The political reptiles
who've been basking for months in constant media sunlight slither
back under their rocks, forcing scribblers like me to seek out
higher life forms. Which is what I tried to do. Unfortunatly, a
press secretary for Ruby the Asian elephant told me Wednesday
morning that her client was ``in seclusion'' and ``unavailable to
the public or the press.'' By E.J. MONTINI Story moved in the ``A''
and ``K'' categories. &QL; 
 &QL; 
DICK DALE-MUSIC (Undated) - You may not know the name. But odds are
you've heard Dick Dale play. Think back to the grinding, groovy
guitar work that kept the action pulsing in Quentin Tarantino's
``Pulp Fiction.'' That's ``Miserlou,'' a Dale anthem from 1962 and
the song that helped introduce the surf-guitar god to a new
generation. Dale's cult success is proof that it's never too late
to achieve popularity. By RANDY CORDOVA. Story moved in the ``E''
ategory. &QL; 
 &QL; 
FAITH HILL-MUSIC (Undated) - If Faith Hill had to name her favorite
year, chances are '98 would be in the running.Her adventurous third
album, ``Faith,'' inspired music critics to pen virtual love
letters. And it clicked not only with country fans, but with
pop-music buffs who turned the jangly ``This Kiss'' into a Top 10
crossover smash. By RANDY CORDOVA. Story moved in the ``E''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
HAPPINESS-MOVIE (Undated) - ``Happiness'' is a gleeful, systematic
demolition of the myth of the suburban idyll. Set in a well-heeled
New Jersey suburb, it eviscerates the relationships among three
sisters and their extended family, finding bitterness, boredom,
sexual dysfunction and vicious sibling rivalry. The most
controversial scenes involve a respected local psychotherapist who
pursues a secret life as a pedophile. 4 stars. By MELISSA MORRISON.
Story moved in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SOLONDZ-MOVIE (Undated) - Indie director Todd Solondz, who won
Sundance praise two years ago with his first film, ``Welcome to the
Dollhouse,'' has made a giant leap with ``Happiness.''
``Happiness'' is much greater in scope and scale, and he pulls it
off masterfully. It's also much, much darker, with rape, murder,
and, most notoriously, pedophilia, figuring in the plot. In an
interview, he talks about what prompted him to make this film, how
he withstood industry pressure to keep it the way he envisioned it,
and what kind of reception he expects from theatergoers outside New
York City, where all that stuff is considered part of a normal day.
By MELISSA MORRISON. Story moved in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
LIVING-MOVIE (Undated) - ``Living Out Loud'' is a little film about
people fighting loneliness in the Big Apple. Judith Nelson (Holly
Hunter), is a woman adrift after her wealthy doctor husband left
her for a younger woman. In an attempt to reconnect with the
outside world, Judith begins frequenting Jasper's, a downtown jazz
club that features a sultry chanteuse (Queen Latifah) as its
featured entertainment. 3 stars. By BOB FENSTER. Story moved in t
he ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
VELVET-MOVIE (Undated) - England's glam-rock scene in the '70s
produced a lot of records that pulsed and throbbed with a tense,
erotic energy. It's also inspired Todd Haynes' colorfully surreal
``Velvet Goldmine,'' which shares the sexual undercurrent and
mind-bending edge of the best music from that long-ago era. 4
stars. By RANDY CORDOVA. Story moved in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
TOUCH-MOVIE (Undated) - In the depths of film noir's black heart
lies a film that incorporates all the wonderful nastiness of the
genre: Orson Welles' 1958 classic, ``Touch of Evil.'' The
bordertown story of corruption, depravity and fear returns today in
a version reedited to more closely reflect Welles' vision. This
posthumous ``director's cut'' contains about 50 changes _ some
large, some small _ suggested by Welles during the editing of the
film but never carried out until now. 5 stars. By DON RENFROE.
Story moved in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
SIEGE-MOVIE (Undated) - Saying a movie is ripped from today's
headlines might imply that the filmmakers didn't have enough
imagination to come up with their own story. In the case of ``The
Siege,'' they let their imagination run away with them. They should
have stayed closer to the headlines. 3 stars. By BOB FENSTER. Story
moved in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
PROTEIN DIET (Undated) - From the ``Lose weight fast! Here's how!''
vault, one of Diet's Greatest Hits apparently is back for a
revival. The high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet isn't new, but
it's trendy. Recently, such books as 1996's ``Protein Power'' by
Michael and Mary Dan Eades and last year's ``Dr. Adkins' New Diet
Revolution'' by Robert Adkins have detailed different versions of
the weight-loss program. By MONTY PHAN. Story moved in the ``L''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
X-FILES-TV (Phoenix) - Preview of ``X-Files'' season-opener, which
airs Sunday. By DAVE WALKER. Story moved in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
DOKES-COLUMN (Phoenix) - Thomas Jefferson's sexual relationship
with his slave probably was as complicated as the days in which he
lived, as conflicted as the man himself. The nation inherited this
Founding Father's self-contradictions and hypocrisies on matters of
race and equality. We are his people indeed. By JENNIFER DOKES.
Story moved in the ``K'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
AUTO-REVIEW (Undated) - Smooth, fast, luxurious, the Aston Martin
DB7 Volante is today's convertible DB model that continues an
84-year lineage of hand-built grand-touring cars. And it is grand.
The DB7's price tag, way up there in a range approachable only by
top CEOs and superstars, makes it more of a fantasy machine than a
real automobile. Just 200 coupes and convertibles will come to the
United States this model year. By BOB GOLFEN. Story will move in
the ``L'' category. EMBARGOED FOR SATURDAY, NOV. 7. &QL;

   DC-FAIRCLOTH _ WASHINGTON _ Some D.C. residents bid a harsh
farewell Thursday to Sen. Lauch Faircloth, R-N.C., who lost his
seat in the midterm election. Wearing pig noses and carrying signs,
they happily delivered a one-way ticket to North Carolina to
Faircloth's Capitol office. Faircloth, a hog farmer, was the
architect of legislation last year that stripped control of most
government agencies from the District's mayor. Sen. Kay Bailey
Hutchison, R-Texas, is the likely choice to fill Faircloth's slot
as head of the committee that oversees district spending. Residents
said Hutchison is a bad choice and would impose her views on the

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The struggling gallery scene in the
Williamsburg-Greenpoint section of Brooklyn is either reaching
critical mass or is about to contract a serious case of ``the good
old days.'' Maybe both.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood has long been known in the art world as a place
where artists take things into their own hands, opening galleries
and running them on shoestrings until energy, money or interest run
out, or their own work becomes more consuming.
</P>
<P>
   They have orchestrated elaborate performance events in abandoned
buildings and even established shaky but persistent alternatives to
alternative spaces. The most venerable of these, Four Walls, is
still in business (sort of) after eight years, without a single
outside grant.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, more and more gallery announcements are being sent out
bearing Williamsburg's palindrome zip-code _ 11211. This weekend
there are at least a dozen art shows to be seen in this sprawling
neighborhood's artistic heart _ the portion bounded by the
Williamsburg Bridge on the south and McCarren Park on the north,
and by the East River and, roughly, the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway
on the west.
</P>
<P>
   And that number, probably a record, doesn't include a few
galleries that are presently closed for installation, like Jessica
Murray's Salon 300 on Graham Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Time never stands still in the New York real estate market, of
course, and the chief harbingers of the next hot neighborhood have
often been artists, propelled by a need for cheap studio space and
aided by an innate sense of the architectural potential of
neglected buildings.
</P>
<P>
   In general, crime is down and so are the number of vacant
apartments and lofts in the neighborhood ; so real estate prices
and rents are up. One artist pointed to a brick garage and said,
with some astonishment, that it had just sold for $1 million;
another reported that $450,000 had been paid for a building so
decrepit that the price was ``mainly for the land.''
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen exactly how big the boom will be here,
given a sizable indigenous population and a building stock that
runs to tenements and small rowhouses punctuated by garages and
squat commercial loft buildings. In contrast, the area Down Under
the Manhattan Bridge Overpass, known as Dumbo, seems like another
universe: a land of majestic commercial edifices actively under
development, where the sky may be the limit.
</P>
<P>
   In low-lying Williamsburg, where the sky itself seems limitless,
it is hard not to feel change in the air. Some are attempting to
stave it off: partly because of unmanageable crowds at its film and
video evenings, Four Walls recently dispensed with its mailing
list, reverting to word of mouth.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the independent, inclusive spirit that has
always characterized the perennially nascent gallery scene here is
visible as never before. In this neighborhood, which feels a bit
like a spread-out East Village crossed with patch of big-sky
Chelsea, galleries come in all shapes, sizes and degrees of finish,
as well as in all kinds of architectural containers _ walk-up
tenement apartments, street-level garages and lofts, both live-in
and not.
</P>
<P>
   The art is equally varied, and not necessarily made only by
Williamsburg artists anymore. The play between the artworks and the
spaces in which they are encountered is remarkably rich. Here is a
tour of some of Williamsburg's current exhibitions, moving from
solo to group shows.
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   One of the quirkiest spaces in Williamsburg is Holland Tunnel,
on South 3rd Street, a front-runner for first place as the tiniest
gallery in the metropolitan area. Opened last spring by Pauline
Lethen, an energetic Dutch woman who sees it partly as a conduit
for Dutch art (hence the title), it occupies a small pre-fab
gardener's shed set in a pretty little yard behind an old apartment
building.
</P>
<P>
   Usually Ms. Lethen can be found sitting just outside at a table,
a position she claims to occupy regardless of temperature. She did
allow, however, that coming exhibitions _ the next will be a
display of contemporary Dutch photography _ may have to accommodate
a number of plants that are stored in the shed during the winter.
</P>
<P>
   The current exhibitor, Brendan Ballengee, has the space to
himself for ``Acme Labs Variation,'' a little black-light
installation whose anti-pollution message is softened by its modest
beauty. The walls are densely hung with thrift-shop landscape
paintings that Ballengee has touched up with iridescent paint.
</P>
<P>
   They glow in the dark, as does the ``Fermi Worm,'' an oozing
slug-like mass of (one assumes ) atomic waste surrounded by water
and wafting curls of smoke, which is named after the father of the
atomic bomb.
</P>
<P>
   As with many Williamsburg shows, music is an important component
here, specifically the eerie electronic sounds of
``Radioactivity,'' a 1978 album by Kraftwork.
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   Ranking high among the solo gallery shows is Katie Merz's
installation at Velocity Gallery, which Sarah Rossiter, an artist,
opened last spring in a high-ceilinged garage space on North 7th
Street. Previously known for bright spirited paintings whose
cartoon style exuded an anarchic feminism, Ms. Merz, who lives on
Manhattan's Lower East Side, is having her first gallery show in
five years.
</P>
<P>
   She appears to have jumped ship for other media, specifically an
energetic combination of photography, drawing and sculpture. These
all figure in an installation whose componentes are suspended on
string running from wall to wall, creating a first impression of
unusually colorful laundry hung out to dry.

SOFTWARE FIRM SUES LYCOS OVER USE OF DOG IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A dogfight over a Labrador retriever has landed
Internet search service Lycos in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Labrador Software Inc. of Danvers, Mass. filed a trademark
infringement suit Thursday in US District Court. The suit seeks to
stop a $25 million Lycos Inc. ad campaign featuring a barking dog
identified as ``Lycos, the Internet retriever.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see why both companies want to use the image of a
hunting dog _ they both make products that hunt through vast
amounts of computer data for specific pieces of information. The
Lycos search engine features an index of millions of Internet
sites. Labrador makes a computer program called ``E-Retriever,''
which uses simple keywords rather than lengthy Internet addresses
to find information on an Internet site or corporate network.
</P>
<P>
   Labrador officials concede they have never trademarked their
name and logo. But they say they have used both since 1996, in
honor of a dog owned by the firm's cofounders, brothers John and
Joe Furrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the strong advice of our attorneys, we felt that we had to
protect our corporate name, our brand,'' said Joe Furrier,
Labrador's vice president of sales and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Polk, Labrador's attorney in the case, says that
trademark law does not require formal registration. ``The law is
that people who use in commerce a mark, a name to identify
themselves, have priority over people who then come later,'' said
Polk.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos's adoption of the retriever image has blurred Labrador's
image in the computer industry, Polk claimed. ``We've gotten 12
phone calls from people in the industry asking, `Have you done a
deal with Lycos?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Davis, president of Lycos, scoffed at the lawsuit. ``To me
it's frivolous to the highest order,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis rejects the argument that Labrador's &UR;  &LR;  company name gives
it the right to stop other Internet firms from using the word
``retriever'' in their ads. He also noted that there's little
resemblance between the retriever images used by Lycos and by
Labrador.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't they sue Taco Bell while they're at it?'' he asked.
``They use a dog.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Davis predicted that the Labrador suit would be summarily
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos is based in Waltham, Mass.

 NEW YORK: to dry.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are lush photographs of small set-up sculptures, which the
artist makes from found objects, Playdo, food, hair gel and
fragments of other photographs. (One is on the floor; at least two
more float overhead on glass shelves.) There are delicate little
drawings, often populated by tiny figures and their exclamations,
which recall the artist's cartoon paintings. And there are curling
coils of clear plastic painted with these earlier cartoon
characters and literally cut to ribbons.
</P>
<P>
   There are also boxes of additional photographs, which one can
thumb through. The ensemble effect is playful yet oddly controlled,
a kind of vertical scatter piece in which nearly each part stands
on its own merits while also contributing to the larger, radiant
bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   Pierogi 2000, one of the area's most active art galleries, is
the brainchild of Joe Amrhein, who decided, in 1994, to promote the
work of Williamsburg artists by filling a flat file with their
drawing portfolios, creating a remarkably efficient way to enable
interested parties to see a lot of art.
</P>
<P>
   And remarkably mobile: the flat files, which now number three
and contain the work of 350 artists, have traveled to exhibitions
in London, Vienna and SoHo, as well as the Brooklyn Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   Amrhein, who is about to move to a larger space next door to
this current also mounts rather ambitious exhibitions in the space
that started out as his studio, including a recreation of ``Dead
Tree,'' an early installation work by the Earth artist Robert
Smithson.
</P>
<P>
   The current show features the wry Late Conceptualism and
art-about-art of an English artist who has called himself Bob and
Roberta Smith since the early 90s.. The match with this writer's
name is pure coincidence, but the double name takes strategic
advantage of the fact that artists' teams and female artists are
both very much in the foreground these days.
</P>
<P>
   The Smith work is of the slapstick variety. On video, Smith
harangues young artists to ``make your mark'' or recalls his
humiliating attempts to get art dealers to look at his slides
(names are named). Viewers are invited to participate in ``The Meat
Game,'' a variant on horseshoe-tossing that involves tossing
artificial cold cuts and steaks into matching holes cut in wood.
</P>
<P>
   The gallery walls are painted or hung with bright signs
announcing ``statements for the millennium.'' ( Amrhein's expertise
as a professional sign painter came in handy here.) These include
``hills are the new holes,'' ``cats are the new dogs'' and, best of
all, ``the late 90s are the new mid-80s.''
</P>
<P>
   When the laughs run out, which they rather quickly do, the flat
files await, and reward, attention. Amrhein will soon move to a
larger space next door to his current one, where he will have
expanded viewing surfaces for the files' portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   Art Moving is the accidental gallery of the artist Aaron
Namenwirth, who in 192 moved into a storefront on South First
Street that had previously been occupied by one of Williamsburg's
first galleries, Brand Name Damages. Passersby regularly inquired
about the next show; and the previous tenant's mail, which included
a fair amount of artists' slides, continued unabated.
</P>
<P>
   Finally Namenwirth, who supports himself with an art moving
business, caved. In 1994, he began holding sporadic shows of
neighborhood artists.
</P>
<P>
   When he was suddenly evicted from the space a year later, he
organized a few ``parasitic'' shows in the art moving truck, by
parking outside Four Walls in one case and the Postmasters Gallery,
then in SoHo, in another.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, he bought a two-story building, a former
chicken-feather cleaning factory, on North 12th Street, and,
working with his wife, Nancy Horowitz, has resumed his sporadic
exhibition program.
</P>
<P>
   The first show, reached by walking through an extremely raw
space, is a highly finished installation by Natalie Moore, who was
one of the instigators of Sauce, another short-lived artist-run
Williamsburg space.
</P>
<P>
   Embedding strands and unraveled tufts of copper and aluminum
wire in blazing white plaster walls that she built herself, Ms.
Moore has created a wall drawing at once subtle and animated. The
wires seem to tunnel through the plaster, pop up suddenly and then
resubmerge; little tufts of wire erupt here and there.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Moore joins a growing group of artists who work in
rather than on walls _ among them Ricci Albenda and _ the work is
also so familiarly Post-Minimalist that it could have been made 25
years ago. And while Namenwirth seems happy to have put down roots
again, don't expect complete stasis. He said the exhibition space
will probably move around within the building.
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   Despite the many solo exhibitions currently on view in
Williamsburg, shows of two or more artists are more the
neighborhood norm. Momenta, a three-year-old gallery that the
artists Laura Parnes and Eric Heist oversee in a former loading
dock on Berry Street, favors the double bill. Its current show
introduces the work of Liza Phillips and Pamela Lins, who share a
futuristic sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Phillips makes blurry paintings based on satellite views of
the earth that balance on the line between realism and abstraction.
Ms. Lin, whose work shows a bit more promise, animates conventional
pedestals by giving them metal vents and then appends them with odd
little sculptural incidents and architectural models.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vented Jump,'' which features a ski-jump-like scaffolding,
avoids conventional Surrealist oppositions most successfully.

   In a sunny tenement walk-up, Everything Is Everything is the
two-year-old project of the artists Michael Asente and Monique
Luchetti, who have lived in Williamsburg since 1984. The shows here
seldom match the charm and light of this pleasant apartment, and
the current one is no exception.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Bach's paintings, which feature rising suns in fields of
dark, carefully textured blue or green, have a congealed, Esthetic

maybe too much.

   Fragments of words (lazy, Baptist, dirty) and numbers (666, the
sign of the devil); bits of labyrinthine patterns and excesses of
pastel colors or piles of excremental browns. Sin and innocence are
all implied and nicely pitted against each other, but the visual
terms are familiar, uninventive and overly polished.

   Last year, Tim Spelios and Carolyn Cox opened Flipside in a
small room and hallway at the front of their Withers Street loft,
literally a stone's throw from the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway.
After several group shows, they have mounted their first two-person
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Ward Shelley shows a group of kinetic sculptures whose basic
theme appears to be failure. In ``Ambitious Toaster,'' the
appliance in question repeatedly attempts to climb a soup ladle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Floor Standing Ashtray'' consists of a pathetic, oddly
appendaged cylindrical ashtray (the kind positioned in office
hallways and doctors' waiting rooms in the days before No Smoking),
which futilely attempts to rise from the floor, only to fall with a
crash and a bounce, thanks to a red rubber ball affixed to its
side. Its moves resemble those of a drunken clown.
</P>
<P>
   In the gallery's drawer-lined hallway, Lynn Mullins, a Hoboken
artist known for ``Trouble,'' her weekly radio show on WFMU, has
concocted a whimsical installation that involves a peculiar, not
entirely convincing blend of the funky and the geometric.
</P>
<P>
   At one extreme are hard-edge wall paintings; at the other,
bright hand-knit covers for the drawer pulls and shower caps
holding strands of crocheted filament. In between are drawings on
teabags and drawings and paintings on vellum; the latter are full
of lacy forms and patterns, which, while in wide use these days,
are the best thing here. But even if the individual parts don't
always hold up very well, the overall effect is rather lovely.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   This month's group shows have all been mounted by relatively
young galleries. ``Offbeat: Humor in Life and Art,'' is spread
throughout a railroad tenement gallery called EYEWASH, which the
artist Larray Walczak opened on North 7th Street six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   This gathering of 16 artists maintains a reasonably high level
of amusement and is notable for the drawings of Ward Shelley, the
maker of the kinetic sculptures at Flipside. On paper, Shelley
elaborately and wittily diagrams such subjects as the history of
music in the universe, art world success (a drawing titled ``What I
Wanted/What I Got'') and five decades of American car design, good
and bad (``Cars R Us'').
</P>
<P>
   Also good here is a new project by Komar &AMP; Melamid that involves
paintings made by self-taught artists in a nearby senior citizens
center. And Lisa Hein and Bob Seng have rearranged and painted with
bright colors the components of three old-fashioned built-in
closets, creating what might be called site-specific abstract
reliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Another recent arrival is N3 PROJECT SPACE on North 3rd Street,
which the artist James Biederman has just opened in the living room
of his loft and plans to devote exclusively to painting. The first
exhibition features the work of six artists, most impressively the
little map paintings of Sharon Horvath, the loosely structured,
beautifully colored geometries of Craig Buckbee and the small
dream-like landscapes of Eric Holtzman.
</P>
<P>
   ROEBLING HALL, occupying in a big groundfloor space on Roebling
Street, is the latest gallery venture of Joel Beck a Williamsburg
regular. ``Utopia,'' the gallery's fourth exhibition, has been
co-curated with Christian Vivero-Faune, a Chilean critic living in
Williamsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Centering on the fairly ubiquitous theme of architecture and its
discontents, it is an impressively coherent effort. Lane Twitchell
renders the entrances of ersatz tract houses in glowing pastels
that do nothing to disguise their anonymity. Colin Keefe outlines
elaborate cities on huge sheets of paper. Also included are works
by Valorie Fisher, Soren Martinsen, K.K. Kozik and Fred Tomaselli.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn Art Gallery was recently carved out of the first
floor of a commercial building on North 6th Street by Joe
Caterinie, David Edgar and Michael Houston, artists and designers
who live or work in Williamsburg. Their inaugural show features
work by Hope Windle, Martin Mazorra and David Ellis, all of it
enthusiastically derivative. Ellis, who creates big
Surrealist-flavored, music-obsessed paintings, makes the most
memorable impression.
</P>
<P>
   __
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's MWMWM, an ``uncomfortable'' gallery (as the
latest generation of shoestring exhibition spaces are called in
Chicago) that has recently relocated from the Windy City to
Williamsburg. It is currently showing a videotape by Ulrich Heinke,
a German artist, which rather obscurely tackles the idea of
professionalism by showing the artist going through the motions of
bar-tending for invisible customers.
</P>
<P>
   Heinke has generously turned a second monitor over to several
other artists whose video tapes treat the same subject _ with an
equal lack of clarity, unfortunately. But his gesture suggests that
the inclusive spirit so basic to the Williamsburg art scene easily
rubs off on newcomers.

   &UR; Bloodsucking With Sensitivity &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This week the horror genre got a boost with the announcement by
Anchor Bay that Werner Herzog's ``Nosferatu the Vampyre'' (1979)
will be released for the first time on video in January. A faithful
and eerily beautiful remake of F.W. Murnau's 1922 silent classic,
``Nosferatu,'' the film stars Klaus Kinski as the Count, Isabelle
Adjani as the pure Lucy Harker and Bruno Ganz as her unfortunate
husband, Jonathan.
</P>
<P>
   Visually stunning, this ``Nosferatu'' is gentle and sensitive in
nature, with comic and erotic moments. The film rides on the
strength of Kinski's vampire, who is more sympathetic than the
Murnau creation.
</P>
<P>
   Videophiles generally regard the title the way the Count sizes
up the nape of Lucy's neck. ``It's one of those got-to-have
items,'' said Milos Stehlik of Facets Multimedia in Chicago. Norman
Scherer, a rare-video dealer in Manhattan, places ``Nosferatu''
high in the ranks of the most-asked-for but says he received many
more requests for, say, ``The Leopard'' by Lucino Visconti and
``The High and the Mighty'' by William Wellman, which have never
been on tape.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Douglas, Anchor Bay's vice president for acquisitions, said
rights for the film would revert to Herzog at the end of this
month, clearing the way for the release. The movie was originally
released by 20th Century Fox, but was lost in the shuffle, so to
speak, when it came to home video. The studio says it isn't
entirely sure why.
</P>
<P>
   There are two versions of the film, one in German and the other
in English. Both will be available, either singly or as a set.
Herzog shot them simultaneously, but they are cut differently.
``Run them side by side and one gets ahead of the other and then
the other catches up,'' Douglas said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all horror offerings come with those credentials, and last
week the genre made only a respectable showing among the first
inductees of the B-Movie Hall of Fame. ``The idea came from the
American Film Institute's list of 100 best films,'' said Ron Bonk,
founder of the hall and president of Salt City Home Video in
Syracuse, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Bonk set up two categories _ artists and films _ at his Web
site, the B-Movie Theater, and asked the public to name its
favorites.
</P>
<P>
   High among the artists, along with the likes of Roger Corman,
John Waters, Ronald Reagan and Inoshiro Honda (director of the
original ``Godzilla'' in 1954) is Jeanne Carmen, star of
``Striporama'' (1950) and ``The Monster of the Piedras Blancas''
(1958). In the film division, along with ``Carnival of Souls''
(1962); ``Death Race 2000'' (1975), with Sylvester Stallone and
David Carradine, and ``Detour'' (1945), Edgar Ulmer's cult
favorite, were George Romero's ``Night of the Living Dead'' (1968),
Sam Raimi's ``Evil Dead'' (1983) and Tobe Hooper's ``Texas Chainsaw
Massacre'' (1974).

</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Horse Whisperer &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Robert Redford's adaptation takes the scenic route around some
of the soapier elements of Nicholas Evans' novel. When Grace
(Scarlett Johansson) and her horse are grievously injured in an
accident, her mother, Annie (Kristin Scott Thomas), drives them to
Montana, where they are taken in hand by Tom Booker ( Redford,
above), a genteel cowpoke. A chilly New York magazine editor, Annie
has a hard time letting go in Big Sky country. Booker is a charming
fellow in an admirably decent kind of way, which grows on Annie.
But Redford's direction and restrained portrayal keeps the focus on
nursing the girl and the horse, which doesn't slam the door on
romance but keeps it on a reserved adult level. The film's one sin
is its excessive length, which might be excused, Janet Maslin wrote
in The New York Times, by ``the material's uncompromising spirit
and tranquil tone.''

<P>
   Survive one meteorite (``Deep Impact,'' available last week) and
darned if another one isn't right behind it. This time it's the
size of Texas, which is big even for a Jerry Bruckheimer
production. Rallying around the flag, a rowdy bunch of oil drillers
respond to their sensitive leader, Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis),
whom we meet as he's trying to kill his daughter's boyfriend (Ben
Affleck). With Stamper in command, the crew will ride a couple of
space shuttles out to the incoming rock, drill a hole, pack it with
explosive and kerblam. Patriotism swells around the old training
camp as the crew gets outfitted in orange space suits. Then it's
the boys vs. the boulder in action that's furious but not ``as
scary as the prospect of raising a generation of Americans on
movies like this'' (Maslin).

   When a small toy company is taken over by a big one, great ideas
start flowing. Why not take advanced computer chips used in
weaponry and put them in military figures for children, in effect
turning G.I. Joes into crazed little supersoldiers. To give voices
to such a gung-ho unit, Joe Dante's animated film employs the
voices of some of the original ``Dirty Dozen'' cast: Ernest
Borgnine, Jim Brown and George Kennedy. Tommy Lee Jones is the
flat-topped platoon leader Chip Hazard. ``Meet death with honor,
coward,'' he advises at one point. Offering opposition are the
nicer Gorgonites, but though the computerized figures are
impressive accomplishments, the story is ``too absurd to be
frightening and too creepy for lighthearted fun'' (Maslin).

NOW THE FALLING LEAVES, LATER THE FRISKY SPRING

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Spring and Fall,'' a ballet that John Neumeier
choreographed in Europe several years ago, had the misfortune to be
sandwiched between works by Frederick Ashton and Jiri Kylian at
American Ballet Theater on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Some might prefer Neumeier's ballets to those of either of the
other choreographers; taste follows no rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spring and Fall'' is certainly a serviceable novelty for a
brief season at City Center. Yet it is hardly convincing to suggest
that the choreography in this company premiere was up to the
professional level of Ashton's ``Patineurs'' and Kylian's
``Sinfonietta.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Neumeier's intelligence shines through a conceptual
frame, and there is a fine pas de deux, beautifully danced by Angel
Corella and Julie Kent, at the heart of the ballet. But the syntax
of the whole is awkward, choreography deprived of organic
connections.
</P>
<P>
   Since Kylian's ``Sinfonietta'' received one of its most
magnificent and exhilarating performances, the comparison was all
the more inevitable. Czechoslovak composers provide the music in
both cases. Kylian turned to Janacek while the five sections of
``Spring and Fall'' are set to Dvorak's Serenade for Strings in E
major.
</P>
<P>
   Nature is celebrated in ``Sinfonietta'' by a link between earth
and sky. Women plant their feet solidly on the ground and men
gallop around the stage in exultant leaps. The life cycle is
identified with the implied tilling of the land, celebrated in a
fleeting image of the Angelus.
</P>
<P>
   Like his music, Neumeier's choreography here is more classical
and muted, but it, too, relates to nature's cycle, suggesting even
a rite of spring with traditional courtship games.
</P>
<P>
   To chart the progress of Corella, as village lad, and Ms. Kent,
as modest village maid, toward mature love may be one way of
decoding the title, ``Spring and Fall.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be wishful thinking to see the title as a movement pun
related to springing up and falling down. Too often, the dancers
get entangled in their own feet or amid rolling bodies to do
either. Ballet Theater's men look uncharacteristically awkward
here.
</P>
<P>
   When part of the work was created in 1991 in Hamburg, Germany,
by Neumeier, the American director of the Hamburg Ballet, and
completed by him at the Geneva Ballet in 1994, the movement was
undoubtedly more understandable to the original casts.
</P>
<P>
   Many a ballet loses something when it is transferred across the
Atlantic. Neumeier has not made clear the link between his use of
the classical vocabulary, especially for the women on toe, and the
generalized physicality of the bare-chested men, who are prone to
push-ups and even to lying prone.
</P>
<P>
   A male ensemble begins the work in silence, walking forward or
back, until Corella, in the center, touching the ground with one
hand, is joined by Maxim Belotserkovsky and John Gardner. The
backdrop, designed by Neumeier, evokes foliage that symbolically
changes hues with the seasons (and Neumeier's lighting).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kent leads in an ensemble of men and women, whose stylized
folk dance, part mazurka, part czardas, is generic enough to evoke
a community. It takes a village to enact a fertility rite, no
matter how disguised.
</P>
<P>
   Four couples come to the fore here until a male ensemble engages
in the dives, tumbles and upside-down maneuvers of the ritual
games. Ms. Kent and Corella seem initiated into the courtship that
they dance to the larghetto of Dvorak's score.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the section that unites sound and movement best;
rising emotion matches a high note with a high lift in
choreography, whose curved shapes and classical base suggest
harmony and proportion.
</P>
<P>
   The finale briefly recapitulates the male parade of the
beginning until, at the end, Corella runs joyfully, arms spread
out, toward the audience and Ms. Kent. Ermanno Florio conducted.
</P>
<P>
   One could smell the grass more pungently when the men ran
through ``Sinfonietta.'' Ethan Stiefel, Joaquin De Luz and Corella,
as creatures of speed and air, were outstanding, as was Sandra
Brown in a different trio.
</P>
<P>
   But this was to stand out in an outstanding cast, which included
Kathleen Moore, Ethan Brown, Keith Roberts, Giuseppe Picone, John
Selya, Yan Chen, Ashley Tuttle, Marian Butler, Ms. Kent and and
Gillian Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Murphy, along with Stiefel, as the Boy in Blue, were
technically perfect in the simulated skating of ``Les Patineurs,''
Ashton's beautiful Christmas card of a ballet. Light and unaffected
in his virtuosity, polished in his final turns a la seconde,
Stiefel gave a performance to remember.

of Elliott throughout.

 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ramblin' Jack Elliott was ''trembling from the
joy'' and President Clinton was quoting Fats Domino at Thursday's
annual White House celebration of some of the country's greatest
artists and academicians.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was just trembling from the joy and trying to keep from
falling off my feet,'' said folk singer Elliott, one of 21
recipients of this year's national medals for arts and humanities.
</P>
<P>
   Asked later to reflect on a career that has produced 40 albums
and inspired such rock greats as Bob Dylan and Mick Jagger, Elliott
said it was largely a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ''These things are all very difficult to digest,'' said Elliott,
standing on the South Lawn wearing a calf-length black coat and
large Western hat. ''It's in the realm of magic. It's all
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was disappointed to learn that Antoine ''Fats'' Domino
wouldn't be present to receive an award for a lifetime of belting
out his own brand of rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I heard he couldn't make the ceremony, I thought, 'Ain't
that a shame,' '' Clinton said _ the title of one of Domino's
greatest hits.
</P>
<P>
   ''Domino grew up in New Orleans,'' Clinton said, ''speaking
French, English and boogie-woogie.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, an Arkansas native, had special praise for the work of
actor Gregory Peck, who Clinton said ''stirred the conscience of a
nation'' in his Oscar-winning portrayal of a courageous lawyer's
lonely stand against racism in a small Alabama town in the movie
''To Kill a Mockingbird,'' based on the novel by Harper Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, the president
awarded the medal to Peck, whose black mustache contrasted vividly
with a full mane of silver hair.
</P>
<P>
   ''His performances have helped to heal some of our country's
deepest wounds,'' said Clinton, who has put the issue of race in
America near the heart of his own domestic agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ''For many,'' Clinton said, ''he will always be Atticus Finch.''
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Harvard University humanities professor Henry Louis Gates Jr.
was awarded the humanities medal for his work in African-American
studies. He said his representation signaled the importance of the
field and reflected the relatively new emphasis on the nation's
cultural diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ''The group of recipients chosen signifies a measure of openness
we wouldn't have seen at a ceremony like this 20 years ago,'' Gates
said in a South Lawn interview. ''To those of us in fields like
African American studies, awards like this are testaments to our
field, because America has always been multicultural, it's just
been in denial about it.''
</P>
<P>
   A medal of arts also went to the Steppenwolf Theatre Co. in
Chicago, and one of the most famous actors to come out of the
company showed up as part of a support troupe.
</P>
<P>
   John Malkovich said later that the award recipients reflected
the vitality and promise of the American arts and humanities
community.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of those people are sort of mold-breakers in a way, and in
a very American way,'' Malkovich said. ''It just shows that, on
some level, people are watching, people do read what they write,
people do think about what they say.''
</P>
<P>
   The national arts and humanities medals are awarded by the White
House each year to artists, patrons and scholars, based on their
life's work.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ramblin' Jack Elliott was ''trembling from the
joy'' and President Clinton was quoting Fats Domino at Thursday's
annual White House celebration of some of the country's greatest
artists and academicians.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was just trembling from the joy and trying to keep from
falling off my feet,'' said folk singer Elliott, one of 21
recipients of this year's national medals for arts and humanities.
</P>
<P>
   Asked later to reflect on a career that has produced 40 albums
and inspired such rock greats as Bob Dylan and Mick Jagger, Elliott
said it was largely a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ''These things are all very difficult to digest,'' said Elliott,
standing on the South Lawn wearing a calf-length black coat and
large Western hat. ''It's in the realm of magic. It's all
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was disappointed to learn that Antoine ''Fats'' Domino
wouldn't be present to receive an award for a lifetime of belting
out his own brand of rock 'n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I heard he couldn't make the ceremony, I thought, 'Ain't
that a shame,' '' Clinton said _ the title of one of Domino's
greatest hits.
</P>
<P>
   ''Domino grew up in New Orleans,'' Clinton said, ''speaking
French, English and boogie-woogie.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, an Arkansas native, had special praise for the work of
actor Gregory Peck, who Clinton said ''stirred the conscience of a
nation'' in his Oscar-winning portrayal of a courageous lawyer's
lonely stand against racism in a small Alabama town in the movie
''To Kill a Mockingbird,'' based on the novel by Harper Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, the president
awarded the medal to Peck, whose black mustache contrasted vividly
with a full mane of silver hair.
</P>
<P>
   ''His performances have helped to heal some of our country's
deepest wounds,'' said Clinton, who has put the issue of race in
America near the heart of his own domestic agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ''For many,'' Clinton said, ''he will always be Atticus Finch.''
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Harvard University humanities professor Henry Louis Gates Jr.
was awarded the humanities medal for his work in African-American
studies. He said his representation signaled the importance of the
field and reflected the relatively new emphasis on the nation's
cultural diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ''The group of recipients chosen signifies a measure of openness
we wouldn't have seen at a ceremony like this 20 years ago,'' Gates
said in a South Lawn interview. ''To those of us in fields like
African American studies, awards like this are testaments to our
field, because America has always been multicultural, it's just
been in denial about it.''
</P>
<P>
   A medal of arts also went to the Steppenwolf Theatre Co. in
Chicago, and one of the most famous actors to come out of the
company showed up as part of a support troupe.
</P>
<P>
   John Malkovich said later that the award recipients reflected
the vitality and promise of the American arts and humanities
community.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of those people are sort of mold-breakers in a way, and in
a very American way,'' Malkovich said. ''It just shows that, on
some level, people are watching, people do read what they write,
people do think about what they say.''
</P>
<P>
   The national arts and humanities medals are awarded by the White
House each year to artists, patrons and scholars, based on their
life's work.

STALKING A LINDY OR TANGO, YOU MIGHT FIND THE BLUES 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By JOYCE WADLER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There may be something as nice as getting all dressed up and
dancing to something Gershwinish with a good-looking man in a dark
suit, but I have never found it, and this is why I find myself, on
a recent three-day weekend, at a Stardust Dance Weekend at a hotel
in the Catskills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over 70 workshops,'' ``Night and Day Dancing,'' ``4 fabulous
days, 3 Exciting Nights,'' ``Each class designed for specific
levels of proficiency,'' says the brochure I pick up at the Dance
Manhattan studio.
</P>
<P>
   I am, by ballroom standards, a mid-level beginner. I have taken
some lessons in the last year. In a strictly social situation _
i.e., a situation in which nobody else can dance either _ I am OK.
But when it comes to knowing actual steps, I get into trouble. I
attribute this to age.
</P>
<P>
   I was 16 in 1965 and started my dancing life with the Rolling
Stones. I never learned to waltz. I had no idea how a fox trot was
constructed until a year ago when my dance teacher put on ``Cheek
to Cheek.''
</P>
<P>
   But when I hear that music, that's it, I am gone. Images of New
York in the 40s and men who look like John Garfield and stockings
with seams come into my head: at last, I think, a score for my
immature fantasy life.
</P>
<P>
   A weekend of fox trot, night and day, sounded very good. Also, I
would perhaps learn to rid myself of my dancing flaws. I have two:
a tendency to lead, which makes men who know steps crabby, and a
habit of hollering when I miss a step.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aaaaaack!'' Something like that.
</P>
<P>
   With Argentine tango, I laugh and holler. I found the solution
for this only a few months ago: Stop doing Argentine tango.
</P>
<P>
   What do you pack for a dance weekend?
</P>
<P>
   The brochure offers no clue, so I go by what I have observed at
Midsummer Swing nights at Lincoln Center: Everything goes, but
skirts look prettier than pants.
</P>
<P>
   I pack everything. I throw in chinos and shirts for the 70 dance
workshops, plus three cocktail dresses, two long dresses and silk
pants and tops for my three exciting nights. A lot of the women
I've seen at dances wear practice shoes, dull black Mary Janes with
a one-and-a-half-inch heel. But I am not sure I am committed enough
to buy a special dance shoe, especially one that ugly. I take
sandals and open-toed shoes instead.
</P>
<P>
   The hotels for the Stardust dance weekends vary. This time, it's
the Hudson Valley Resort, a boxy, modern building between Kingston
and New Paltz, two and a half hours' drive from Manhattan. Under
previous ownership, it was the Granite Hotel and went bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   The new management isn't looking so good either. Arriving at
dinner (dress: sports jackets for the men and dresses for the
women), I find widespread malcontent. You cannot get a drink, hard
or soft, in the dining room. The food is slow in coming and not
very good. The crowd looks older than I: mid-50s and retirement
age, though there are some people in their 30s and 40s.
</P>
<P>
   But three dance floors have been set up in the L-shaped dining
room, and, just as advertised, people are dancing. Yet the
prospects for women without partners, for both dancing and
something more (it turns out there's a singles group here, too) are
reportedly not so hot.
</P>
<P>
   There are two single women at my table; attractive, sixtyish
Manhattan widows who give the impression that given 60 seconds,
they could scope out anything _ the lox at Fairway, the merchandise
in the designer room at Loehmann's _ and they are unimpressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing for us here,'' one says. ``This weekend is going to be
a waste.''
</P>
<P>
   The dancing?
</P>
<P>
   ``I danced with one of the so-called hosts,'' the second woman
says. ``He was supposed to be a dancer. He couldn't dance. He told
me he was a basketball player. A basketball player. It was
impossible to follow him. He had these big feet, enormous. His big
feet were all over you.''
</P>
<P>
   After a show featuring, of course, dancing, there's Latin
dancing in the bar, swing and smooth ballroom (fox trot and tango,
I think) in a larger room. I hang out in the Latin room, though I
am not a great Latin dancer. But the music is better, and I am
thinking I could use a drink.
</P>
<P>
   The room is full of exceptional dancers, many of whom seem to
know one another. There is a stocky man in his late 50s with
suspenders who looks like Claude Rains and leans into a tango with
such urgency and control that I construct a romantic life story for
him, and a woman with a spectacular figure who is dressed like
Chiquita Banana in a halter and a long white wrap skirt. She salsas
endlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Not me. I think I'm looking OK, in a short little cocktail
dress, but four hours into my dance weekend, I haven't danced one
dance. My Stardust information sheet says that dance hosts wear
blue badges, and that if you are not approached by a dance host,
you should feel free to ask one to dance.
</P>
<P>
   But there are more single women than dance hosts, and if you
have the nerve to grab one, which I do not, you have to be quick.
They're like the shrimp at a cocktail party; they get picked off
fast.
</P>
<P>
   A guy with a blue badge and a determined look in his eye comes
over to ask me to dance. He's a foot taller than I am, which is a
problem with dancing, and his feet are enormous. Though I can salsa
a little, I can't follow him at all. My first dance of this
weekend, I think, and I am visibly incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basketball player, right?'' I ask the tall man.
</P>
<P>
   My next partner is also a dance host, but he is closer to my
height and a stronger lead. A former New York City detective. I am
a reporter; I feel relaxed around cops. Too relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got spaghetti arm,'' the cop host says.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, right, my third dancing flaw.
</P>
<P>
   The cop-host waggles my right arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's limp,'' he says. ``It's hard for me to move you when your
arm is limp. Also, you're leading.''
</P>
<P>
   But I'm a part of the crowd now. I dance till 2 in the morning,
with Claude Rains; with the cop; with Lou Brockman, my dance
teacher from the city, who has been performing at the hotel and
pops in late.
</P>
<P>
   When I go to bed, my feet are swollen in a way they have never
been swollen before. I'm thrilled. It's like Tony Curtis getting
calluses in ``Trapeze,'' when he's learning to do the triple. By
Sunday, I figure I'll be ready for the Harvest Moon competition.
Then in February I'll go to Vienna for the Opera Ball.

 UNDATED: Opera Ball.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The next morning, there are blisters on my feet and sandals that
have always been comfortable are not. But I'm here to learn to
dance. I put Band-Aids all over my feet and go to three classes in
the morning: samba, because Lou is teaching, and he's always fun;
hustle, because it's a dance this crowd seems to do a lot; polka,
because I walk into the wrong room. As soon as I can politely
leave, I go to Lindy.
</P>
<P>
   The classes range from 24 students to more than 70. Two teachers
explain the steps slowly enough for the beginners; the other two go
so quickly that if you have not had some dance experience, you're
lost. Some partners are patient; some are not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spaghetti arm,'' a partner reminds me, again, and I start
seeing myself as a Marvel Comics heroine: Spaghetti Arm. By day,
she's a reporter who cannot spell Cincinnati, though that does not
bother her too much because she covers New York; by night, she
lures bad guys to the Rainbow Room and tangos them to death. Snaps
their vertebrae in one of those bend-'em-backward maneuvers I'm
seeing a lot of this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that means that Spaghetti Arm would have to lead, and
most of your dancing bad guys would probably not go for that. This
fantasy needs work.
</P>
<P>
   Back to the reality of the classes. There is one gloomy absolute
here: There are always a few more women than men, and those chosen
to dance are the younger, more attractive women. If the teachers
don't rotate partners, the single women are left to dance alone or
with other women, in which case one is doing the man's part.
</P>
<P>
   I am young in this crowd, so I usually have a partner. But I see
some women who are being left out and are getting upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are five of us left and the instructor says, `Stand on
the side, they'll trade off with us later,' '' says a woman in her
70s, after a class. ``Like we're baggage. Like somebody is doing me
a favor by dancing with me. So I walked out. I don't know, maybe
I'm too sensitive.''
</P>
<P>
   At lunch, I find a place with a gang of terrific dancers I've
spotted the night before. They talk past me. When I tell one of the
women I'm a beginner, here on my own, she wonders if I'm not
wasting my time. Beginners without partners don't get to dance that
much, she says.
</P>
<P>
   I can't completely agree. I've found some very generous
partners. But as the weekend wears on, I began to think she's
right. Outside the classes, at meals and cocktail parties, I am not
dancing as much as I'd like.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, I put on a long clingy navy dress shot with
silver and go down to dinner feeling great. Six hours later, having
danced four dances with four hosts, I return to my room, look at
myself in the mirror and decide I look like Marilyn Monroe in the
period when Robert F. Kennedy was giving her a hard time and she
was hitting the eclairs.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, I take a Lindy class in which the instructor
quickly and tactlessly gives up on my partner, a construction
worker. (``I didn't know it was a dance weekend,'' he says, wailing
as much as a construction worker permits himself to wail. ``I
thought it was a singles weekend.'') I try to teach him the dance
myself. Not so easy, he's got a hundred pounds on me.
</P>
<P>
   The next class is international waltz. I explain the first few
steps to a woman who comes in late; she thanks me and takes my
partner.
</P>
<P>
   I check out early.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, I go to the Marc ballroom, off Union Square, where
there is ballroom dancing every other Sunday night. Watching the
dancers, I realize something has changed: I am aware of patterns
now, the way when learning a language, one is suddenly able to
understand words.
</P>
<P>
   But my confidence level is still not 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a tendency to lead, and I holler,'' I tell my first
partner, the first time I stumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holler all you like,'' he says, and I relax, and for the next
half-hour, we're dancing.
</P>

U.S. TO SEND $70 MILLION IN AID TO STORM-BATTERED CENTRAL AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States will send $70 million in
equipment, food and services for emergency disaster relief to
Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, Clinton
administration officials announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials also said that Tipper Gore, wife of Vice
President Al Gore, will travel Tuesday to Central America to show
the U.S. commitment to aid victims of Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst disaster we have seen in this hemisphere,''
Brian Atwood, head of the Agency for International Development,
told reporters at a White House briefing.
</P>
<P>
   Atwood said that Boeing 747s, loaded with the first shipments of
a $20 million emergency food aid package, will begin leaving New
Orleans on Saturday for Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala. Later, a
fleet of ships will replace the planes and form a distribution
network that will send an additional $20 million worth of medical
supplies, fuel, transportation equipment and food to the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at risk of seeing disease and major problems resulting
from people being stranded without food for more than five or six
days now in Honduras,'' Atwood said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the food package, the U.S. military will provide an
additional $30 million worth of supplies, search and rescue
equipment and engineering services to rebuild roads and bridges,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military, which already has provided 17 helicopters and
three fixed-wing aircraft to the Honduran government, will also
send additional Blackhawk helicopters to Nicaragua, which currently
has only two.
</P>
<P>
   Army Brig. Gen. Robert Wagner, deputy director of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, said at the news conference that 600 U.S. troops
are in the region and that their search and rescue missions have
saved nearly 700 people. He added that the U.S. military has
distributed 345,000 pounds of relief supplies to thousands of storm
victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We began sending planes into the air within hours of the storm
letting up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Honduran officials estimate that at least 6,420 people were
killed throughout the country by the storm and that 5,807 others
remain missing. Some 600,000 people are crowded into thousands of
temporary shelters because their homes have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   International aid officials estimate that the hurricane killed
around 9,000 people throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   Atwood said Hurricane Mitch has caused more immediate and
widespread property damage than the civil wars in the region during
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take years before these countries are back to the way
they were,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The level of destruction has caused some administration
officials to fear that thousands of Central Americans could decide
to migrate to Mexico and the United States in coming months if they
continue to face food shortages and have little hope that their
economies will be repaired.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Schwartz, senior director for multilateral and humanitarian
affairs at the National Security Council, said the governments in
the region remain stable. He added that the United States will
provide the necessary aid to ensure victims of the storm that their
countries will be rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   Atwood said: ``It's important that the people of Central America
see an immediate response so that they don't feel that they need to
leave the area.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mrs. Gore will be in the region Tuesday and Wednesday and will
be accompanied by Atwood and a small congressional delegation.
</P>
<P>
   First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton also will travel to the
region, visiting Nicaragua and Honduras on Nov. 16. She later will
stop in El Salvador and Guatemala before going on to Haiti and the
Dominican Republic for a visit that had been canceled because of
Hurricane Georges, which struck the Caribbean in October.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's new aid package comes on the heels of sharp
criticism by Central American leaders and international aid
organizations that the initial U.S. response was too slow and that
American officials had underestimated the scope of the devastation.
</P>
<P>
   The Council on Hemispheric Affairs said Thursday that unless the
United States and other countries significantly increase their
relief efforts, ``it will take upwards of 20 years to restore the
infrastructures of Honduras, Nicaragua and Guatemala to the level
they were at before the hurricane hit.''

   PLEASANTVILLE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tobey Maguire, Reese Witherspoon, Joan Allen, Jeff Daniels,
William H. Macy, J.T. Walsh, Don Knotts &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Gary Ross &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PG-13, 116 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a weird-looking remote control, an incompatible
teen-age brother and sister, David ( Maguire) and Jennifer (Ms.
Witherspoon), are sucked into a television set and land in the
middle of a 1950s show called ``Pleasantville.''
</P>
<P>
   Far removed from HIV, ozone depletion and other troubling topics
under discussion at their high school, the incredulous pair find
themselves in a black-and-white world that makes ``Father Knows
Best'' look like ``Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   In Pleasantville, fathers are always in shirt and tie and expect
supper on the table at 6, teen-age couples build up to holding
hands and basketball players never miss a shot, let alone lose a
game.
</P>
<P>
   An ardent fan of the show and a student of its every detail,
David, now called Bud, knows just how to fit in and not upset the
show's rigid routine, which he considers mandatory if he and his
sister are to escape and return to their own world.
</P>
<P>
   But the lusty Jennifer, now addressed as Muffin, skips
hand-holding with a newly appropriated boyfriend. ``What's sex?''
asks her benighted Pleasantville mother, Betty (Ms. Allen).
</P>
<P>
   Soon David decides to help the Pleasantvillers work out of their
sterile ways, read books, explore ideas and express their feelings.
Those who embrace this new thinking take on color; those resisting
stay in black and white.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed by the ``coloreds'' among them, the town's leaders
initiate repressive measures. But liberation proves hard to resist
(is that Jennifer reading a book?).
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE When the suddenly unrepressed Betty turns up nude in a
wildly colorful Gauguin-like mural, the black-and-whiters riot,
wrecking a malt shop, burning books and otherwise acting like
Nazis. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX ``I've had 10 times more sex than any of these kids,'' says
Muffin, who has some of it, audibly if not visibly, in the back of
a car on lovers lane. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY Some up-to-date profane exclamations now and again
escape David and Jennifer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-7 They would like the gentle, charming David and his
feisty sister, but the story's convolutions and unsavory features,
as mild as they are, make the film inappropriate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 8-12 Children throughout this age range should be genuinely
taken with the ingenious retreat into the past and with David and
Jennifer and the ideas they represent. Parents should be aware of
the violence, sex and profanity, though, relatively speaking, they
don't amount to much. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 13 AND UP There could be appeal for younger teen-agers.

   T-REX: BACK TO THE CRETACEOUS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A 3-D Imax production at Sony Theaters Lincoln Square &QL; 
Liz Stauber, Peter Horton, Kari Coleman, Laurie Murdoch, Tuck
Milligan &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Brett Leonard &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No rating, 45 minutes
</P>
<P>
   No one has ever found a dinosaur egg, but Ally Hayden (Ms.
Stauber) is sure that the rocklike object her father, the eminent
paleontologist Dr. Donald Hayden (Horton), has brought back to the
natural history museum from a dig in Alberta, Canada, is indeed the
issue of a creature from the Cretaceous (the latest geological
period of the Mesozoic Era). What's more, she speculates, it could
have belonged to a Tyrannosaurus rex.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor, who is too preoccupied with major paleontological
affairs to give his daughter and her theories much more than a fond
passing nod, has his doubts. One evening, though, the egg or rock
or whatever it is rolls off a work bench and discharges a gaseous
emission that transports Ally into the museum's rain forest
exhibits, which are suddenly alive with dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE The woods are full of scary sights and sounds, but
nothing becomes too threatening. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOOTNOTE Head sets are required to view the 3-D action, which
becomes quite spectacular as dinosaur snouts poke right into the
balcony seats and a rock-climbing assistant at the dig takes a
spill down a sheer cliff (she's saved by a lifeline).
</P>
<P>
   On another matter, Ally's parents are apparently separated, or
becoming so, a story element that, for whatever reason, is
fleetingly injected and then not pursued. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-5 This is a large spectacle, full of big sights and
sounds that could occasionally startle and perhaps upset very small
children. It should only be momentary. On balance, if they can
manage the head sets, they shouldn't be overwhelmed by the movie. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 6-9 They will love it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 10-12 They, too, should have a grand time, even older
children who profess to have graduated from this kind of thing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 13 AND UP Many teen-agers wouldn't be caught dead in this
kind of movie, but they might find themselves enjoying it.

</P>
<P>
   Directed by Bryan Singer &QL;
</P>
<P>
   R, 100 minutes
</P>
<P>
   In Singer's adaptation of a Stephen King story, young, icy-eyed
Todd Bowden ( Renfro) leans close to the elderly Kurt Dussander (
McKellen). Todd has dusted Dussander's mailbox for fingerprints and
found 14 ``compares,'' or matches needed for absolute
identification of Dussander as a Nazi war criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Does Dussander realize what the police would do with the
information? Or the Israelis? All told, the boy concludes, it would
be better for the old man to do what he wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Todd wants Dussander to tell him what it was like at death camps
where Dussander was a guard and helped exterminate people. Todd
wants him to tell him how long it took to kill the victims in the
shower rooms and how they looked and acted as they were being
gassed and everything else about what took place. Tell him or Todd
will turn in the old man, who now lives as a recluse under an
assumed name.
</P>
<P>
   But Dussander proves to be a whole lot more than Todd bargained
for and, turning the tables on the boy with a nifty ruse, plunges
the two of them into a shifting game of survival.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE Not continual but a good amount, and graphic. Dussander
stabs a drifter and throws him in the cellar. Later the supposedly
dead man rises and attacks Todd, who brains him with a shovel. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX None. &QL;
</P>

   PROFANITY Strong obscenities. &QL;
</P>
<P>

<P>
   UNDER AGE 13 This is not a film for children, though older ones
in this group might be drawn by the subject matter. &QL;

teen-agers have seen as bad or worse in many films. Violence
acknowledged, the film does present provocative issues in an
intriguing manner.

 &HT;    CLINTON ORDERS $70 MILLION IN U.S. AID TO HURRICANE-RAVAGED
CENTRAL AMERICA
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Stunned by the rising toll of death and devastation
from epic flooding in Central America, the White House is sending
$70 million worth of food, medicine and other emergency aid to help
save lives in the shattered region.
</P>
<P>
   The assistance, officials said Thursday, is just the beginning
of what will likely be a years-long aid effort by the United States
and other nations to help hard-hit countries like Nicaragua and
Honduras recover from the trauma of a catastrophe without precedent
in this part of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the worst disaster that we've seen in this
hemisphere,'' said Brian Atwood, director of the U.S. Agency for
International Development, the assistance arm of the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to more than 9,000 people already believed dead,
''We estimate that some 25 years of investment in infrastructure
has been destroyed,'' said Atwood.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency aid is needed, Atwood said, to prevent uncounted
others from dying.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is just to save lives,'' Atwood told reporters at a White
House briefing. ''We are at risk of seeing disease and major
problems resulting from people being stranded without food for more
than five or six days now in some parts of Honduras.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the president's announcement Thursday, the bulk of the
aid being mobilized into the region --ravaged by Hurricane Mitch --
initially was coming from the private sector, led by groups such as
the Red Cross and Atlanta-based CARE, but including an overwhelming
number of American businesses, schools, churches and individuals.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton ordered the Pentagon to immediately send some
$30 million worth of military supplies and assistance to the
region, where some 600 U.S. troops and 40 American military
helicopters are already at work.
</P>
<P>
   They are helping with emergency search-and-rescue missions and
transporting critical supplies of food, water and medicine to
remote areas.
</P>
<P>
   Those missions will continue, as military engineers work to get
vital roads and bridges repaired, said Brig. Gen. Robert Wagner,
deputy director of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our helicopters have rescued nearly 700 people, (through)
direct evacuation,'' Wagner said.
</P>
<P>
   USAID is sending another $40 million worth of wheat and other
food to the region, as well as fuel, medicine, emergency shelter
and other disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
   The first of a scheduled 22,800 tons of emergency food aid is to
be airlifted out of New Orleans, La., on Saturday aboard a Boeing
747 jumbo jet.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is just an initial response,'' Atwood said of the
$70-million effort. ''It's clear that we will need to go and do a
second phase,'' aimed at longer-term rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to take a couple of years to get these countries
back to the kind of economic growth and stability that they have
been experiencing recently,'' Atwood said.
</P>
<P>
   And, while it's difficult to estimate the dollar-value of the
damage so far, he said ''you're talking about millions, if not
billions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States will likely bear the lion's share of the
international aid effort, Atwood said, though Clinton spoke
directly with Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo about assistance on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina, Canada and other nations in the hemisphere are also
expected to pitch in with disaster relief, as is the European
Union, the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think, as usual, the richest country in this hemisphere will
be the number one donor,'' Atwood said, speaking of the United
States. ''But we really want to see a coordinated effort here,''
involving other nations and institutions.

DEMOCRATIC EFFORT TO ROUST VOTERS PAID BIG DIVIDENDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In Illinois, union workers started their
door-to-door campaigns to activate voters last June. Vote for
Democrats, they told them.
</P>
<P>
   In Nevada, volunteers pressing the same point had reached 90
percent of the state's union membership by Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   And in Kentucky, Republican workers calling voters found out
that their opponents had already beaten them to the dial tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``People picking up the phone were saying, `My God, will you
please quit calling me?' '' said Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky,
a Republican campaign leader. ``They had obviously been called
three or four times by the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   Spread throughout the country, those grass-roots activities by
an array of Democratic groups turned an expected Republican
election victory Tuesday into an unexpected boon for the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   It came down to which party could turn out its base. And the
Democrats, despite being outspent by more than $100 million and
with a president facing an impeachment inquiry, won. Labor,
African-Americans, Hispanics and women turned out for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   On the GOP side, the Republicans' battle-tested troops,
religious conservatives, did not storm the barricades as strongly
as they normally do. A Christian Coalition survey showed that
Democratic congressional candidates received almost a third of the
religious conservative vote this year. In 1994, they received only
a fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christian conservatives are not a wholly owned subsidiary of
either party,'' Randy Tate, the coalition's executive director,
said Wednesday. ``They're up for grabs.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Democrats gained at least four seats in the
House, when historically the party controlling the White House
loses 25 seats or more in a midterm election. That brings the
breakdown in the House to 223 Republicans, 210 Democrats and one
Independent, who usually votes with the Democrats. A race in Oregon
was still undecided.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Democrats battled to a draw, maintaining the
55-45 split in favor of the Republicans. The GOP for a while had
contemplated reaching a 60-vote, filibuster-proof majority.
</P>
<P>
   So Wednesday became a day for rejoicing and recriminations.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats crowed that their campaign focusing on Social
Security, education and health care had not only set the political
agenda but had put into motion their own resurrection as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is the first day of Campaign 2000,'' House Minority
Leader Richard Gephardt said. ``The days of the Republican majority
are numbered.''
</P>
<P>
   With such a narrow margin in the House, Gephardt said, Democrats
will try to fashion alliances with moderate Republicans. He ticked
off a wish list that included tobacco legislation, money for more
classrooms, a minimum-wage increase, campaign finance reform and a
patients' bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, meanwhile, are hardly comatose. They still
control both houses of Congress and 31 governors' mansions. But for
failing to offer their own agenda, and more important, running ads
critical of President Clinton in the campaign's final days, the
Republican leadership was under fire.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding curiously like Vice President Al Gore, who in the days
before the election hammered the Republicans for wanting to
investigate and do little else, Tate said, ``If that is your one
obsession and you have nothing else to offer, you are going to have
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Voter surveys bore that out. Voter News Service reported that 62
percent of those surveyed said they disapproved of Congress'
handling of the president's problems concerning Monica Lewinsky,
and 58 percent said Congress should drop the impeachment issue
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys by the AFL-CIO and the Christian Coalition both showed
that Clinton's problems were not a significant factor with voters.
</P>
<P>
   The president clearly took heart from the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``In yesterday's election, I think the message the American
people sent was loud and clear,'' Clinton said before a meeting
with advisers about Social Security. ``They want progress over
partisanship and unity over division.''
</P>
<P>
   For the president, who largely confined his campaigning to
fund-raising events and Rose Garden pronouncements, Tuesday was a
sweet victory as he heads into an uncertain post-election season
expected to be dominated by impeachment hearings in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Houdini president does it again,'' said Bert Rockman, who
teaches political science at the University of Pittsburgh. ``He's
absolutely the most resilient, tactical, resourceful politician I
think I ever have seen.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rockman said Clinton also has the advantage of being
president at time when House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Majority Leader
Dick Armey and Majority Whip Tom DeLay ``reflect the face of the
Republican Party nationally. They are not an inviting face to many
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the results, Gingrich said the media's interest in
scandal prevented the Republicans from getting other issues aired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost impossible to penetrate the news media or the
talk shows on any topic,'' he said. ``Until we look at it better, I
frankly don't understand all the things that happened yesterday,
and I'm not sure anyone else in the country does, either.''
</P>
<P>
   But that may not get the speaker off the hook with some in his
own party. Some House conservatives are still bristling over what
they felt was Gingrich's cave-in to the White House on last month's
budget agreement. The speaker faced an aborted coup attempt more
than year ago, and some GOP conservatives were speculating
privately that another insurrection could be mounting.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republican leaders, meanwhile, simply blamed their own
inability to formulate an appealing agenda and energize their
voters. Rep. John Linder of Georgia, chairman of the National
Republican Campaign Committee, said the anti-Clinton ads, aimed
only at certain districts, largely in the South, to rev up the GOP
base, turned out be ``inconsequential.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he wished he had spent part of their $10 million price
tag on get-out-the-vote efforts, and he complimented the Democrats
on theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to congratulate them,'' Linder said. ``We had hoped
to be in a position for a wave, and there was one, and they caught
it. We lost virtually every close race. I expected we would gain 10
to 12 seats. We lost five.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic effort was aided by Clinton, Gore and first Lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton, who crisscrossed the country to campaign
for candidates, and a grass-roots organizing drive by a variety of
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an off-year election, you have to give people a reason to
vote,'' said Amy Chapman, assistant political director of the
AFL-CIO. ``We had to let members know that if they didn't vote,
they were putting the fate of a number of issues they care about _
HMO reform, Social Security _ in the hands of people who didn't
necessarily have the interests of working people at heart. In a
low-turnout election...anyone who turns people out is king.''

`VELVET GOLDMINE' DIGS DEEP FOR GLAM-ROCK GLITTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm not sure if what you hear in writer/director Todd Haynes'
new picture, ``Velvet Goldmine,'' is the sound of the picture
trying to force down more than it can chew, but there aren't many
rock 'n' roll movies like it. I can't think of another one that
seeks to evoke the presence of Oscar Wilde while trying to compare
the glam-rock London of the early 1970s to Weimar Republic Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Haynes sees the decadence of glam rock as a
liberating force, an icy stab into the weedy haze of the hippie
period, with its give-peace-a-chance fakery. The picture has a
gleeful taste for rot; Haynes doesn't avoid the '70s appetites for
flesh and drugs. ``Velvet Goldmine'' may not be the glam-rock movie
for people who like glam rock, but Haynes plays out his schoolboy
crush on the idiom with an appreciation for the damage that it
caused.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is missing a little something because its Dorian
Gray//David Bowie character (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) doesn't quite
become the big next thing as we watch. With his wide eyes and plush
lips, he's less reminiscent of Bowie than of T. Rex's Mark Bolan, a
full-featured icon who sent the girls into a frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   In a cheeky ``Citizen Kane'' wraparound, a reporter (Christian
Bale) is assigned to track down a missing rock star (Meyers), and
sets in motion a bigger story _ a lost believer looking to recover
his own version of the Christ myth. ``Goldmine'' cuts back to
flashes of thin androgyny running through the streets of London in
chunky shoes and blousons, presenting even more of a threat to
parents than the free-love hippie vibe that immediately preceded
it. Haynes definitely understands the appeal that gender-switching
glam had to kids still trying to figure out their sexual roles.
</P>
<P>
   In case you miss the '30s Germany theme, Ewan McGregor shows up
as Curt Wild, an American self-destruct mechanism who's equal parts
Iggy Pop and Lou Reed; Wild falls in with (as well as in love with)
Meyers. Like Iggy, Wild is a Midwestern hedonist who might set
himself on fire while crossing a room in order to see what it
looked like. McGregor's vigor gives ``Goldmine'' abandon and animal
crackle, even though his accent is as in-and-out as AM radio on a
long drive.
</P>
<P>
   McGregor and Toni Colette, in a knockout performance as Meyers'
wife, are alive and eager. As is the British comedian Eddie Izzard
as Meyers' manager, whose mercenary shrewdness is so vivid that he
makes a bigger impression than his wardrobe _ with wildly patterned
lapels that could serve as landing strips.
</P>
<P>
   Meyers can't quite pull off the combination of opportunist and
savant that ``Goldmine'' requires. Maybe the movie reveres its
Bowie figure a little too much. Bowie was the first Brechtian pop
figure, a man who laid out his career like a battle plan and
flashed a price tag for his soul.
</P>
<P>
   Pop may never have another figure like Bowie, whose influence
was so awesome but who sold relatively few records. Haynes misses
out by not dealing with the enormous amount of frustration that
would've caused his protagonist. Imagine a man with so much
ambition who had to wait almost two decades before he made a splash
on this side of the pond.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie has such an obsessional magic. It holds you, if
for no other reason than Haynes' display of dazzling technical
skill that may surprise those who've seen and liked his earlier
work. The movie may lack an inner life, but it has a vicious charge
and the intoxicating audacity of pop.

ECONOMY STRONG, FED REPORT SAYS; TEXAS AGRICULTURE, ENERGY
STRUGGLING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MITCHELL SCHNURMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Is the economic party over?
</P>
<P>
   Not yet, according to a report released Wednesday by the Federal
Reserve, which described the national and regional economy as
growing _ albeit more slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing and construction remain high, although there are
signs of softening. Retail sales, while lower than hoped, are not
creating high inventories. And labor markets remain tight, but not
enough to push up wages.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, overall conditions are much the same: The economy is
still strong, but it's backing off, as consumers appear more
cautious, the Fed's Beige Book says.
</P>
<P>
   Housing construction remains robust, consumer prices are low and
dropping, and most labor markets are still strong.
</P>
<P>
   But two sectors, agriculture and energy, are struggling badly in
Texas and they're expected to fall further. The Fed predicts that
up to 25 percent of Texas farmers and ranchers will be forced out
of the business within a year. In energy, widespread layoffs have
been announced, and more are expected.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has ``been growing jobs faster than our population for the
past couple of years, and there's a limit to how fast you can
grow,'' said Fiona Sigalla, an economist with the Federal Reserve
Bank of Dallas, who wrote the Texas section for the Beige Book.
``We're beginning to see some of the effects of the Asian crisis,
and we're definitely seeing a big change in commercial
construction. But we're just cooling to a level of growth that's
still the envy of much of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Although agriculture and energy have been the hardest hit in
recent months, manufacturers are feeling some pain, too. The Fed
said that sales were lower for cement and wood products in Texas,
and many semiconductor makers are reporting flat sales.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Rickett, chief executive of Dynamo Ltd. in Richland Hills,
said his company has faced a declining market since midyear. Dynamo
makes arcade games, selling many to other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Asian business is almost dead, and Eastern Europe has
dried up,'' Rickett said, adding that his company had trimmed about
40 workers in the past year to respond to shrinking demand. ``The
bright spots have been Mexico and South America. But we're
hunkering down right now, because we don't see anything improving
until next spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Dynamo sells many of its games to entrepreneurs who install them
in arcades. In the past few months, Rickett said, his clients have
been unable to land the financing to expand, and Dynamo has seen
its credit tightened.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed report says that lenders, concerned about borrowers'
credit quality, have begun to tighten standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commercial construction, some lumber companies and smaller
retailers all say they're having trouble getting the credit they
need,'' Sigalla said.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect for farmers and ranchers is more severe. They've
faced droughts in two of the past three years and that, combined
with low yields and low prices, means that many are ``in dire
financial shape,'' the Fed report says.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 25 percent could be driven out of the business over the
next year, the report says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among the people who depend on farming for their primary
income, a large percentage won't be able to stand up to the
economic adversity,'' agreed Bob Brown, executive vice president of
Farm Credit Bank of Texas in Austin. ``And many won't be able to
get bank financing.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown urged embattled farmers to contact their lenders before
their loans go into default, because they may have some choices in
adjusting the notes.
</P>
<P>
   In energy, the problem is global and regional. Global supplies
are strong, pushed by Russia and other countries eager to improve
their financial positions. In the Gulf of Mexico, tropical storms
hurt some domestic suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   The Beige Book is based on interviews with about 100 businesses
in dozens of industry groups. It represents the opinions of the
respondents, not the Federal Reserve, and is used by the central
bank when it considers monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   The report says that Texas' housing construction remains strong,
especially in lower-priced homes. But about six weeks ago, banks
put the brakes on loans for many commercial construction projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a complete stop to speculative building'' in
commercial real estate, Sigalla said.
</P>
<P>
   Retail sales appear to be softening in Texas, according to the
Fed report. And some stores said they were selling at lower prices
and making markdowns earlier than last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In VCRs and stereos, Asia is not missing an opportunity to
make a sale,'' said Stuart Schuster, president of Marvin
Electronics Co. in Fort Worth. ``But we're not having a big
close-out sale yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are more cautious, and they've changed their shopping
patterns in the past few weeks. But they're still spending as much
money.''

SMALL TOWN MAKES OUTCASE OF JUVENILE SEX OFFENDER WHO MOVES IN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By OSCAR AVILA  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORDLAND, Mo. _ Almost overnight, Jason Nester went from being
the popular new kid in high school to an outcast feared by parents.
</P>
<P>
   In late October, residents in this town of 500 learned of
Nester's criminal record. When Nester was 9, he served three years
in juvenile detention in Washington state for raping a younger boy.
</P>
<P>
   His parents came to Fordland, 15 miles east of Springfield, in
search of a fresh start. Instead, Nester has been shunned since the
news broke.
</P>
<P>
   ``People thought I was a pretty neat person,'' the 16-year-old
says quietly. ``Now they won't even talk to me because of my
past.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents are especially upset that a sex offender could move in
undetected. A 1994 law requiring offenders to register with local
authorities apparently doesn't cover juveniles such as Nester.
</P>
<P>
   Residents schedueled a town meeting for 7 p.m. Thursday night at
the middle school to discuss changing the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``People all over Missouri need to worry about this,'' resident
Anita Branson said. ``They could have people like this at any
school. This is a situation that needs to change.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy already has changed Fordland, residents say.
</P>
<P>
   This is a town where everyone knows everyone. One longtime
resident boasts that he could go down to the elementary school and
identify every student in his grandchildren's classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a small community and a lot of people have thought
that nothing bad can happen here,'' said Todd Clark, the town's
police chief. ``It can and does happen in small communities across
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are sort of waking up to that.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; brk:A warm welcome  &LR; tx:When Nester's family arrived in
Fordland, they saw why the town has a reputation for hospitality.
Students befriended the boy _ who they nicknamed ``Skeeter'' _ and
invited him to several Halloween parties.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Nesters had hoped for when they left the
Olympia, Wash., area. There, Nester was harassed and threatened at
school. Their landlord considered Nester a threat and tried to
evict the family.
</P>
<P>
   Laveta Nester, Jason's mother, said the family chose Missouri
because the state had no law requiring juvenile sex offenders to
register.
</P>
<P>
   A month after the Nesters moved to Fordland, someone faxed a
newspaper article about him to police. Word spread through town in
less than a day.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the town proposed ``a sort of backwoods justice,''
according to one resident. They had hoped to run the entire family
out of town. Since then, the family and residents agree that things
have calmed down.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Nester doesn't deny that he made a mistake. He said he
sexually assaulted a young boy ``out of curiosity,'' not with the
intent to hurt him. He was convicted in 1992 of first-degree rape.
</P>
<P>
   After spending three years in a juvenile facility, Nester said
he has learned his lesson and promises never to repeat his crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a stupid choice of mine,'' he said. ``I wish there was
some way that I could change it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many residents have never seen him, although stories around town
portray him as a muscular menace.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are talking like I'm 6-foot-5 and 300 pounds,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nester is no rail, but he's nowhere near those dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   In person, Nester comes across as quiet and shy.
</P>
<P>
   Nester proudly shows a visitor his rock collection, which he
built by writing to geological officials from other states. The
other day, he made a small rabbit out of clay he found outside his
house.
</P>
<P>
   His family says some people misunderstand Nester because he has
Tourette's syndrome, which sometimes causes him to inadvertently
blurt out profanity in class. His mother says medication is helping
control the symptoms. Nester also suffers manic depression and
hyperactivity, his mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Nester will be tutored at home because school officials worried
that his safety would be threatened at school.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone has turned away.
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago, a family came to the Nesters' door and offered
their support to the family, which includes Jason, his parents and
a younger brother. Their son even invited Jason Nester to go
fishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I meet people, I bend over backward to get along with
them,'' he said. ``I just want to make a good impression on people.
I'm not a bad person. I want them to think better of me.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; brk:Reaction is mixed  &LR; tx:There are signs that the town is
adopting a ``live and let live'' approach to the Nesters, the
police chief said. Police are patrolling his neighborhood to make
sure the family is safe.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents say it's an unfortunate situation for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorry for the entire family,'' resident Paulette Riddle
said. ``I even feel sorry for that kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, that sympathy is mixed with genuine concern.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents say they don't think Nester should be allowed
back in school. Teachers can't supervise him every second of the
day, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Parents also are upset that the school district didn't notify
them.
</P>
<P>
   Residents fear that Nester will commit another sex crime. The
Handbook on Sexual Assault, an international study, estimates the
recidivism rate for rapists at between 7 percent and 35 percent. A
five-year study on sex offenders treated in Missouri found that
about 9 percent become repeat offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Young sex offenders aren't unusual, either. A California guide
to child protection says almost half of offenders are under 18.
Programs to rehabilitate juvenile offenders have increased 30-fold
in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Washington authorities have classified Nester as a ``Type III''
sexual offender, the most serious category. Type III offenders are
``predators,'' who exhibit a pattern of assaults and the ability to
manipulate victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a behavior that is learned and it doesn't go away
easily,'' said Detective Daryl Leischner, who registers sex
offenders at the Thurston County Sheriff's Department in
Washington. ``I wouldn't want my kid playing with a kid with this
type of history.''
</P>
<P>
   Leischner said Nester was classified Type III in part because he
admitted to other sexual assaults. Nester now says he made up those
other incidents ``to make myself seem more important.''
</P>
<P>
   His family thinks Nester's problems stem from severe abuse he
endured before they adopted him. Nester received counseling in
Washington after being charged. He hasn't been counseled since he
moved to Missouri. The family plans to seek a psychological
evaluation to show that Nester is no longer a threat. But right
now, it's too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Residents say their concerns go beyond the Nesters.
</P>
<P>
   Residents want the law to force all sexual offenders to register
with the sheriff's department _ even juveniles, who aren't included
now. Juveniles typically are treated differently throughout
Missouri's justice system.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Missouri passed the law requiring registration. The law
was strengthened this year, allowing some sexual predators to
remain confined even after their jail sentence ended. Washington's
law, passed in 1990, was the first in the nation requiring
registration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important for the people in the area to be aware
that someone is here who might bother them or their family,'' said
state Sen. John Russell, a Lebanon Republican who is pushing a
change in the sexual-offender law. ``That lets them be more alert
to the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Legislators plan to ask the attorney general for a legal opinion
on the sex-offender law. Until then, a spokesman for the attorney
general's office would not comment on whether the law could be
interpreted to cover juveniles.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Nesters plan to stick around town, at least
for now.
</P>
<P>
   Nester spends his days at home, playing Nintendo or helping his
mother write a book about their experiences in Washington and
Fordland.
</P>
<P>
   Nester doesn't know how the final chapter will come out, but he
promises: ``This is going to be a pretty good book.''

<P>
   I just can't keep that woman out of the yard.
</P>
<P>
   She's out there again, leaf rake in hand, humiliating me in
front of the neighbors, all of whom hire teams of men with
mechanical blowers or order their minor children to collect up the
leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Please do not think I am lazy. Cheap, maybe, but not lazy. There
is nothing I would rather do than spend the next month or so
tidying up the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when we moved into the house 36 years ago this month,
the lawn was my governing passion.
</P>
<P>
   The man before me had a gift for growing grass. Probably he
fertilized. The result was a vigorous green turf, whose blades
stood stiff and straight as a Marine's crewcut.
</P>
<P>
   I also inherited from that previous occupant a contraption for
sweeping the lawn clean of leaves. It had revolving wire teeth in
front, and a huge canvas hamper in the rear, and the whole
apparatus was enormous.
</P>
<P>
   It was, I believe, the only such machine on the block. When I
wheeled the thing out of the garage, I was as swollen with pride as
a man bringing forth the family sailboat.
</P>
<P>
   It worked, magnificently. Nothing was missed. And if, after the
lawn was swept, I happened to notice an errant leaf spin down to
rest on the combed grass, I would rush out immediately to pluck it
up.
</P>
<P>
   That was the first year or two. Then, as happens, slippage
began.
</P>
<P>
   The fabulous machine broke. And so did the gasoline lawn mower
passed down from my wife's father. The grass became discouraged by
lack of feeding, and gave way first to weeds, then to beaten earth.
That's how it's been for years now.
</P>
<P>
   Leaves, however, we still have in great quantity. And, as I've
said, there is nothing I would rather do than deal with them
myself.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, my time is quite valuable and I have a great many
obligations. So it simply is not feasible that I should be expected
to rake the yard.
</P>
<P>
   If it were left to me, I would let nature have its way. For one
thing, there will be winds. Always in autumn there are winds. They
tend to blow in from a westerly direction. In due course, our
leaves would become the property of neighbors to the east.
</P>
<P>
   The few left behind we could classify as mulch, or eventually as
compost. Slow decay would return them to the soil to nourish new
growth. That is the normal cycle of living things.
</P>
<P>
   That the environmentally sound approach also happens to be the
easy one is entirely coincidental. It simply was not in Nature's
grand plan that the glory of the autumn should be turned into a
burden and a torment.
</P>
<P>
   The sensible course, then, is to let time handle things. By
spring, the leaves will be forgotten. Or if not this next spring,
certainly in a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   That's my view of it. But no! My wife insists on presenting
herself out there in full view of everyone on the street _ the leaf
martyr, the Joan of Arc of autumn with a rake for a sword. If I had
wanted to share life with a woman with calluses on her hands, I'd
have married a Russian beet-picker.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime I sit inside here, husbanding my valuable time, meeting
important obligations, watching her toil away in a pathetic bid for
sympathy. I know what other people must think of me, and the shame
I feel is rather great.
</P>
<P>
   But it is bearable.

LAYING `SIEGE' TO STEREOTYPES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Audiences caught up in the trailer for ``The Siege,'' a
political suspense thriller by director Edward Zwick, are thrown
for a loop when Bruce Willis pops up as an Army general. In fact,
you could be injured by the projectile guffawing that erupts when
popcorn begins flying out of startled mouths.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, audiences will get involved in the whip-smart
performance of Denzel Washington and the sense of dread that fills
the air when the possibility of internment camps begins to loom
over the country. New York City is being driven to its knees by a
terrorist threat that's Arabic in origin. As Hub, the FBI agent
assigned to the case, Washington cuts through the investigation
with a lethal assurance.
</P>
<P>
   He's not an empty-headed missile of his government, but Hub is
so involved in getting his job accomplished that he never thinks to
examine the bigger picture. When free-floating fear and anger lead
to the declaration of martial law, and Arab-Americans are herded
into prison camps, the story takes on a tragic aspect. It also
helps to have an African-American in the lead; Washington's pain is
palpable as he watches the prison camps fill, but the race issue is
never flaunted, and that's good.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Siege'' is built on a fundamental irony; it's about whose
job it is to ask questions, but the right ones aren't asked until
it may be too late. Like ``Glory'' and ``Courage Under Fire,
Siege'' is another of director Zwick's movies about a sensibility
rarely offered in American movies _ that patriotism is not only the
prerogative of the right wing.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is having quite a year. After his fine work in ``He
Got Game,'' he comes through with another alert turn. He's so
single-minded that his jock's confidence is shaken only when a
hostage situation literally explodes into catastrophe. He begins to
become a different man, and when his partner, (Tony Shalhoub) a
devout Muslim, sacrifices himself to the paranoia and helplessness
over terrorist attacks, Hub has to rouse himself from his one-track
thinking and dig deeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Siege'' has an efficient manner that's only derailed by
the presence of Willis. He even works in the first hour or so,
because his Gen. Devereaux has the most confessional sympathetic
lines to speak. He seems to show regret at being forced to exercise
military stratagems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Army is a broadsword,'' he says, softly, solemnly, ``not a
scalpel. You do not want us in an American city.'' But Willis
reaches his limit when he has his few scenes with Washington. You
can see Hub's respect for the decorated Devereaux _ and for this
arm of government _ diminish before your eyes. It's a subtle,
anguished moment; everything Hub has stood for is suddenly wrong.
Unfortunately, it's almost as if you can see Washington's respect
for Willis drain away, too. Willis just isn't up to what is asked
of him.
</P>
<P>
   The climax, then, makes Willis come off as a garden-variety
villain; he turns a smart movie into a genre. But ``The Siege''
motors along competently before it runs into a wall. Annette Bening
is a vague presence who plays both sides against the middle, and
ends up becoming the film's conscience. She has the most
information, and suffers the most. It's Shalhoub's awakening _ he
gives a nuanced, thoughtful performance (he may be constitutionally
incapable of bad acting) _ that makes ``The Siege'' linger. As good
as Washington is, you may ask yourself what the movie might have
been like if it had an Arab-American hero who was forced to choose
sides. And it's Shalhoub whose loss we feel.

 NOSTALGIA FOR ALL THINGS UTILITARIAN, PLAYFUL AND PLASTIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By GRACE GLUECK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Plastics were pretty dull stuff to have around the house until
the early 1960s, when new technologies for mass production
attracted the attention of home furnishings designers. Cued by
space-age innovations and Pop Art, the designers _ mostly European
post-modernists not unfriendly to kitsch _ seized on the potential
of plastics for bright, tutti-frutti colors, appealing surfaces and
sexy, rounded shapes.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the new plastic objects made their first appearance in
futuristic movies, like ``2,001: A Space Odyssey'' and ``Soylent
Green,'' warming up consumers to the bliss that awaited them before
the products themselves were actually on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Utilitarian and sometimes playful _ like a 1971 coat rack of
polyurethane foam in the shape of a cartoony cactus _ the
designers' creations made light of traditional furniture, with its
historical baggage and dust-collecting details. In fact, the
material itself affected the esthetics of plastic objects, which
could be stacked, easily moved and arranged in modular groupings by
their purchasers.
</P>
<P>
   But the plastics carnival that began in the early 1960s was
short-lived. By the mid-1970s, when the cost of petroleum (crucial
to plastics) went through the roof, designers turned back to more
conventional materials.
</P>
<P>
   Now this razzle-dazzle era has been reprised in ``Pop Goes the
Plastic,'' a show at the Katonah Museum of Art in Katonah, N.Y. On
view is just about as much as you want to see of the ``fun''
furniture, lighting equipment, inflatables, electronic gear,
fashions, decorative accessories and various works of Pop Art that
partook of the plastics revolution. The show was organized by the
Atlanta International Museum of Art and Design, with Scott Reilly,
an art historian who specializes in design of that era, serving as
guest curator.
</P>
<P>
   Seating is high on the show's agenda. One well-known example is
the inflatable armchair called ``Blow,'' made in 1967 by the design
team of Jonathan de Pas, Donato d'Urbino and Paolo Lomazzi for
Zanotta of Italy. Of transparent polyvinyl chloride (or PVC), this
feather-light but grandiose plopdown is actually a takeoff on
Eileen Gray's upholstered ``Bibendum'' chair of 1929, based on the
puffy Michelin Man logo of the Michelin Tire Company.
</P>
<P>
   More corporeally, there is the bright red ``Tomato,'' made in
1971 by Eero Aarnio for Asko Oy of Finland. This plump, bulbous
affair of glass-reinforced polyester would seem to put the sitter
smack in the middle of an overripe tomato. Among several stackable
chairs in the show, the cleverest is ``Cantilever,'' designed in
1960 (but not produced until the technology became available in
1967) by Verner Panton for Herman Miller Co. in the United States.
Jointless and legless, this all-of-one-piece affair with a modified
``S'' contour is supported solely by the cantilevered seat, which
also acts as its base.
</P>
<P>
   A lovable quality of plastic furniture was its flexibility.
Take, for example, the ``Modular Room Divider With Lighting
Elements,'' made in translucent white by Pierluigi Spadolini and
Paolo Felli for Kartell of Italy in 1969. It is composed of simple
single and double cylinders in two heights, which can be arranged
in a do-it-yourself grouping to serve as both room divider and
lighting unit. Then there's ``Baby,'' the bright red mobile cart
made in 1970 by Joe Colombo for Bieffeplast of Italy. An elegant
wheeled affair with well-orchestrated shelves, drawers and pockets,
it could be used for anything from holding tools to serving tea.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The ``Brick System,'' devised in 1971 by de Pas, d'Urbino and
Lomazzi, has as its basic unit a Lego-like plastic brick, used to
build bookcases and other kinds of storage units. Another multi-use
item was ``Quattriquarti'' (1960), by Rodolfo Bonetto for Bernini
of Italy: small, legged units in bright orange that could be used
singly or grouped to form a serpentine shelf or table.
</P>
<P>
   In lighting devices, the gamut ran from ``Tatu,'' a small yellow
table lamp shaped like a piece of industrial duct and designed by
Andre Ricard for Metalarte of Spain in 1973, to ``KD-59,'' a robust
1980 white floor lamp by Annig Sarian for Kartell that is nothing
more than a bare, tapering column topped by a big round bulb. A
particularly whimsical entry is ``Sinus'' (1972), by Ettore
Sottsass for Stilnovo of Italy, a vertical row of bulbs that looks
like a cross between a traffic signal and a makeup strip for an
actor's dressing table.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic goods in the show _ radios, televisions,
telephones, turntables, clocks and calculators _ were the most
affected by space-age design, housed in curvaceous casings that
echoed the shape of the moon and other sky bodies, with
techy-looking instrument panels. The TR-005, a 1972 tabletop
television by Panasonic cased in silver-painted plastic, was cued
by an astronaut's helmet; so was the Weltron 2001 portable
eight-track radio of 1970. JVC's Video Capsule of 1972 was actually
designed to look like a space re-entry capsule, with a swiveling
flip-up screen. Panasonic's Toot-a-Loop from the same year was a
bright red radio that curved around the wrist like a bangle.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkled through the show are cleverly designed household
accessories like bars, umbrella stands, wastebaskets, ashtrays,
bookends, magazine racks, tableware and an icebucket. And the
Katonah Museum has thoughtfully added a section devoted to fashions
to the original exhibition. Its bevy of oufits range from a 1967
Courreges-designed ``Baby Doll'' dress of crinkly white organza,
paved with pink satin daisies and iridescent plastic paillettes, to
an ankle-length evening ensemble of the same year, with matching
coat and dress in thin gold plastic. And it would be hard to top
the shoes designed by Herbert Levine in 1967: patent leather, clear
and silver vinyl that take the form of mini racing cars.
</P>
<P>
   It may not reflect the greatest moment in industrial design, but
no one can say that this show fails to deliver the (ersatz) goods.
And for those who love Toys-R-Us, the appeal will be instant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pop Goes the Plastic'' remains at the Katonah Museum of Art,
Route 22 at Jay Street, in Katonah, N.Y., through Nov. 29.

PAZIENZA HAS FIGHT ON HIS MIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MASHANTUCKET PEQUOT RESERVATION, Conn. _ Vinny Pazienza knows
why he's at Foxwoods Casino, and so does anyone who's ever heard of
him. He's here to fight.
</P>
<P>
   At 35, not much has changed for Pazienza but the shape of his
nose, which resembles a lefthand turn followed by a sharp right. He
has come here to do what he has been doing since the days when his
nose was straight and he thought the boxing game was, too.
</P>
<P>
   He's not here for the money _ which is all but incidental in
this case. He is here to punch somebody in the nose and, quite
frankly, probably get popped in the nose a time or two before he's
done with Arthur Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Allen is a scrappy, 6-foot-2-inch super middleweight with a 24-3
record whom Pazienza had no intention of fighting when this idea
came up of returning to Foxwoods for a tuneup before he challenged
Charles Brewer for the International Boxing Federation 168-pound
title.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was for him to fight an old and used-up warhorse named
Kevin Pompey to get ready for what he hoped would be a return both
to HBO and to a world championship. Then, as it does so often,
boxing intervened.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer lost his title on a controversial split decision to Swen
Ottke in Germany, a country where a lot of strange things seem to
happen to the guy who's not carrying a German passport when he
arrives at the arena to fight.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after that, it was learned that Pompey had forgotten to
mention that when he signed to fight Pazienza on ESPN2's new Friday
night series, he had to push his hand across the paper because he
had bone chips in his elblow floating around the way John Glenn has
been doing this week. When that came to light, it eliminated
Pompey, and promoter Jimmy Burchfield began to sift through a
half-dozen potential opponents in search of one acceptable to ESPN
matchmaker Russell Peltz, Foxwood boxing coordinator Tom Whipple,
and Pazienza.
</P>
<P>
   They finally settled on Allen, who had gone the distance with
Pazienza's New England rival, Dana Rosenblatt, a few months back
and thus held a special allure to the former two-time world
champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the fact he went 10 rounds with Rosenblatt,'' said
Pazienza (42-7). ``This guy is very durable. I don't understand how
these guys who are so skinny are so tough, but when it comes to
tough, they got my picture in the dictionary next to the word. No
one is tougher than me. I'm going to show Rosenblatt what should
have been done with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allen is kind of tall. He's 6-2 1/2, and I'm, what, 5-8?
Brewer was 6-1, so this would have been a good tuneup if Brewer
didn't lose, but I don't care who I fight. I think I can beat
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   He nearly has, winning legitimate world titles at 135 and 154
pounds from the IBF and World Boxing Association as well as three
fringe titles from the World Boxing Union, International Boxing
Organization, and International Boxing Council, titles even
Pazienza calls ``the off ones.''
</P>
<P>
   The quest for one last world championship is really why he is
here, fighting before a house that has been sold out for weeks. He
is here to go to work, to get closer to a shot at the man who beat
Brewer. But more than anything else, Vinny Pazienza is here to
punch somebody in the nose as many times as it takes to get rid of
him.
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of work he likes, sort of the way firefighters
like big fires and police officers like chasing armed robbers. It's
an odd and dangerous job, but he enjoys it more than anything else
he can think of except, maybe, starring in what he hopes will soon
be a movie of his remarkable life story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wake up thinking about fighting,'' Pazienza said. ``I go to
sleep thinking about fighting. I broke my neck and kept thinking
about fighting. I get sore hands and my neck gets stiff sometimes
and I think about fighting. That's what I do. I fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Pazienza understands he is running out of time. Boxing is a
cruel and disloyal mistress. She's turned her back on everyone who
ever loved her, even on Sugar Ray Robinson and Sugar Ray Leonard
and the incomparable Muhammad Ali.
</P>
<P>
   So Pazienza understands his days in the arena are winding down.
But until the night he knows he has no chance to win and no
inclination to fight over that notion, he will keep coming to
packed arenas to give all he has. Some nights that is a spectacular
knockout like the one he scored over Rosenblatt two years ago.
Other nights it is his blood. Every night it is his courage, which
he has shown so often that it seems unnecessary to mention it again
_ until you watch him crack his neck in his hotel room to get it
loose or look at the huge knot on one of his hands, an arthritic
remainder of when he broke it long ago against someone's hard head.
</P>
<P>
   That is what boxing is really all about for most fighters.
Boxing is about pain and how much of it you can take, and few
fighters have known more pain than Vinny Pazienza over the years.
Pain from cuts and broken bones and lost money and from a shattered
neck doctors told him had ended his career when, of course, he knew
better.
</P>
<P>
   He has won the biggest of fights _ world championship fights _
and he has lost the biggest of fights _ a million-dollar-plus
payday against Roy Jones Jr. in which he kept going down and
getting up until, when the bout was finally stopped, he lay on the
floor screaming at the referee, ``Let it go! Don't stop it! Let it
go!''
</P>
<P>
   That is the kind of guy a skinny kid from Pittsburgh named
Arthur Allen is facing in a packed arena. A guy who always gets up
with the intention of murdering you if he has to.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the arena is packed again, because the ticket buyers
know what Pazienza will give them. And when it's over, he'll move
on to the next fight.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes this fight will take him to Germany, where Brewer was
robbed and where Pazienza is willing to take his chances for one
last shot at a world title. If he gets it, he knows he will be
fighting against the odds in Germany. But then, he's been fighting
against the odds since the first day he slipped on boxing gloves
back home in Rhode Island and decided to give a new sport a try,
not knowing it was the one that hits back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was supposed to fight Brewer, so why not fight the guy who
beat him?'' Pazienza said. ``I know what's gone on in Germany, but
it would be something different. I wouldn't mind going there. I
believe I'll knock him out. You do that, they got to give you the
belt, don't they?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they do, so if he gets by Allen and gets to Germany this
winter, don't bet against him. He'll go there the same way he'll go
into the Fox Theatre Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   He'll go there looking for a fight.

ARTS(AT)LARGE 
 A REMEDY FOR STALE WEB DESIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  By MATTHEW MIRAPAUL 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Josh Ulm, five megabytes of cure is better than a bit's
worth of prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that the Internet was suffering from a nasty case of
the graphic blahs, Ulm concocted the Remedi Project, an online
showcase for 10 digital designers seeking to reinvigorate the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The Remedi Project -- its name is an acronym for ``redesigning
the medium through discovery'' -- acts as a tonic for eyes strained
from viewing insipid sites constructed with tired techniques and
too little imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Launched in May and expanded in September, Remedi serves as a
visual manifesto that, through its inventive examples, calls for
graphic artists to cast off the chains of design convention and
explore the evolving capabilities of the Web, a metamorphosis that
is symbolized by the animated butterfly that flutters around the
site's screens.
</P>
<P>
   In the small chunk of space it takes up on Ulm's server, Remedi
manages to expand perceptions of what can work on the Web. Remedi
participants created their pieces specifically for the project, and
most have successfully integrated sound and video into the mix in
interesting ways, as in John J. Hill's strange and evocative
``Transmitting Agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the pieces require visitors to abandon traditional
methods of navigating through a Web space. Matt Owens's ``The
Blinders,'' for example, uses overlapping windows to portray a
psychodrama. Ulm's own ``da fam'e le'' defines four characters
through words that are spoken at the cursor's touch, but the order
is determined mostly by the viewer, which can change the meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Ulm, a digital designer in San Francisco, said in a telephone
interview that many of the Web's interactive elements remain
undeployed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use the word to mean clicking on buttons and hyperlinks,''
he said, ``and interactivity can mean so much more than that. It
can mean changing the whole general direction, or it can mean
creating something unique that the author never intended. Those are
the kinds of things that some of these pieces try to do.''
</P>
<P>
   As an advocate for a new-design religion, Ulm is more of a
practitioner than a preacher. ``I don't want to be a movement
leader,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he professed to being saddened and frustrated by the state
of Web design today, feelings that are heightened when he considers
the Web's ability to revolutionize how people communicate and the
manner in which information is conveyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me sick to think that, with all of this technology
and all the potential for it, the best thing we can come up with to
express emotion with is drop-shadowed file tabs,'' Ulm said. ``It
makes me want to stand on a box and scream at these people to wake
up and start to do something that takes advantage of what they have
in front of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the most expressive pieces on the Remedi site is Annette
Loudon's ``Skyline,'' which offers a poetic panorama of San
Francisco rooftops that scrolls across the screen at a meditative
pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hers runs pretty slow,'' Ulm said. ``It's kind of Zen in that
way. You're not meant to rush through it, you're meant to sit back
and enjoy it as it scans by, which is a feeling that Remedi is
trying to get across, that people need to slow down and take in
what they're experiencing instead of clicking through everything as
fast as they can.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the pieces (especially Hill's) can require a substantial
amount of download time, and visitors' browsers need Shockwave and
QuickTime plug-ins to display many of the site's features.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the Remedi entries are groundbreaking. George Larou's
mischievous ``Ultra Clean'' sports a familiar '50s retro look, and
the maverick designer Terbo Ted's ``Terbo Remedi'' is a
well-executed version of that ever-popular genre, the Web-site
parody. ``If you took everything that was horrible about the Web
right now and put it into one site, you would have 'Terbo
Remedi,''' Ulm said.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Portland, Maine, who studied film at Syracuse
University, Ulm came up with the idea for the Remedi Project after
launching Eye Candy, a now-dormant site that allowed him to comment
on works of online graphic design that he admired.
</P>
<P>
   An informal virtual community of digital designers developed out
of his Eye Candy activities, and Ulm eventually invited 20 of them
to submit pieces to Remedi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to find a way that all of us could not have a client,
not have any kind of parameters around our work, and just
experiment and see what kinds of things we could do with the
Internet that had never been done before,'' Ulm recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Ten of the 20 invitees responded with the pieces that are now
enshrined on the site. Ulm said they may eventually be updated or
replaced with newer work.
</P>
<P>
   In September Ulm added a gallery, ``Further Maturation,'' which
will allow him to present new work. A standout at present is
Shannon Rankin's ``Flesh,'' a disturbing blend of interactive text,
images and sound.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in January, Ulm pledged, the gallery will be updated on
a quarterly basis with at least three new pieces, with works by
Eric Rodenbeck and Daniel Jenett scheduled for the new year.
</P>
<P>
   Ulm conceded that as the Web keeps changing, he runs the risk of
having his site lose its impact over time, but he does not yet know
how he can avoid that plight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea what it [Remedi] is going to require of me
three months from now, because the Web changes that fast,'' Ulm
said. ``For me to predict what I'm going to need to do to in order
to keep it fresh would be about as smart as me not keeping it
fresh.''

SCHOOLS GRAPPLE WITH COST OF 'FREE' COMPUTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  By PAMELA MENDELS 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new company called ZapMe! is offering schools thousands of
dollars worth of free computer equipment, software and Internet
access in exchange for the right to post advertising in schools.
Schools that accept ZapMe!'s free equipment get computers that use
an interface containing tasteful, but unmistakable advertisements
and corporate promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the San Ramon, Calif.-based enterprise say its
arrangement is a good deal for educators, bringing state-of-the-art
technology for no cost into cash-starved schools. ``When I first
heard about this, I asked the ZapMe! people 'Are you sure your
offices are in San Ramon and not the North Pole?''' said Theodore
F. Maddock, technology coordinator for Mt. Diablo High School, a
public school that uses ZapMe! and serves a largely poor and
minority student body in Concord, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But critics find little to cheer about in the venture. They say
ZapMe!'s offerings are a cyber-extension of what they view as a
troubling trend, an increased willingness by schools to give up
their long-held status as commercial-free zones and allow corporate
promotion in classrooms. ``This is one of a number of commercial
initiatives that tie in access to selling students' eyeballs,''
said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the nonprofit Center
for Media Education, an electronic media public interest group in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Selling is not the purpose of public education.
Educating students is.''
</P>
<P>
   ZapMe! was launched quietly as a pilot program last spring in a
handful of Northern California schools, both public and private.
The venture, which has placed its system in about 20 high schools,
middle schools and junior high schools, launched officially last
week, and plans to have its system running in another 280 schools
by the end of this year. If all goes according to plan, ZapMe! will
expand to elementary schools next year.
</P>
<P>
   Schools that join get free computer equipment and services --
including a satellite dish, 15 personal computers for a computer
lab and Internet access -- as well as support and maintenance of
the system. It is a package worth about $9,500 a month over a
three-year period, according to Frank J. Vigil, president of the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Users also get access to the World Wide Web, which can either be
unfiltered or limited to about 10,000 educational sites chosen and
reviewed in detail by ZapMe! content editors. Users see all of this
material, however, through the ZapMe! interface: a frame containing
an advertisement in its lower left-hand corner. The frame, always
with an ad, surrounds all ZapMe! material, as well as all Web sites
that students visit. In addition, some of the ZapMe! reviews and
other educational content may carry small boxes with advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Vigil said the company is sensitive to its student audience, and
would refuse advertisements for tobacco, alcohol or other products
generally considered harmful to minors. He said the company also
requires promotions to be tasteful, more akin to PBS sponsorship
notices than broadcast television commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Vigil asserted that advertising is becoming increasingly common
in schools and argued that ZapMe!'s plan was a common-sense way for
education officials to bring down the high cost of introducing new
media into the classroom. ``What is important is to recognize that
there is a big gap between what schools need to fulfill this
mission and what they can afford to provide,'' he said. ``Parents,
the local taxation [authorities] and the government haven't solved
the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But Andrew J. Hagelshaw, senior program director for The Center
for Commercial-Free Public Education, based in Oakland, Calif.,
compared the venture to Channel One, the controversial enterprise
that provides televisions and other equipment to schools in
exchange for students' being required to watch the company's
12-minute, advertiser-supported daily news broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelshaw argued that advertisements divert attention from
education and distort the priorities of school officials who should
be focused on pedagogy, not commerce. He said that in some cases
the ads can even undermine what children are learning by sending
mixed messages -- for example, if students learning about good
nutrition see advertisements in school from fast food companies, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``ZapMe! is just another example of advertising to a captive
audience of kids,'' Hagelshaw said. ``It's just using a new
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   But some people say ZapMe! points to a more fundamental problem
about using the Internet in the classroom: Much of the content, at
least on the Web, is supported by advertising, so students are
likely to encounter commercials anytime they surf, regardless of
whether they are using the ZapMe! system.
</P>
<P>
   For Peter A. Hutcher, instructional technology coordinator for
the Oakland Unified School District near San Francisco, this was
one of the key issues in the decision to accept ZapMe! into three
schools in the district.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is less intrusive than what you get if you go to Alta
Vista,'' he said, referring to an Internet search engine.

HOW LAPTOPS TRAVEL LIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  By STEPHEN C. MILLER 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everyone wants a lighter laptop, but one with all the speed,
disk space, and large, crystal-clear display to match any desktop
system.
</P>
<P>
   If the price also matched desktops, that would be ideal. But
realistically it is a tricky business making a light laptop with
all the bells and whistles of its desktop sibling. You start by
stripping off everything that is not absolutely necessary for the
operation of the computer -- the floppy drive goes, the CD-ROM
drive goes, you shrink the keyboard and you reduce the screen size.
</P>
<P>
   In today's marketplace, thin is in. To accomplish that, you also
have to dump the ports. A parallel port's required physical
dimensions is, at least, an inch and a half deep. Forget the
mouse/keyboard connector unless it is USB or infrared. You now have
a thin, light computer weighing in at 4 pounds or less.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you want to load software, play games, store files
to a floppy disk or print anything, you need to carry all those
things with you. That adds a couple of pounds or more and, well,
you see the problem.
</P>
<P>
   A new trend is developing that is, at least for me, an
acceptable compromise. It involves putting all the ports and drives
in a single case that connects to the bottom of the laptop and that
can be carried with you. The docking station can then add a few
extras like better speakers, a built-in network connection, another
bay for an extra battery, a second hard drive or a DVD drive.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of the docking stations is that there are no cables
to clutter up the desk, especially in hotels where desk space is
limited or non-existent. These portable docking stations can be
left at home, or, as I did on a recent trip, left in the hotel
secured with a security cable while I took the laptop to a meeting
to take notes.
</P>
<P>
   The Compaq Armada 3500's docking station (they call it the
Mobile Expansion Unit) gets a big plus because of its price, $199.
The 3500 itself allows for that low price by not using all the
normal weight-reducing options. It keeps all the ports -- printer,
serial, video, USB, etc. -- and that adds to the unit's depth and
weight.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, weight is relative. I don't consider its 4.4 pounds
for the entry-level model, with the 12.1-inch screen, all that
weighty, especially when you have 12.1 inch screen and an
adult-sized keyboard. Even at the upper end with the 13.1-inch
screen and a 6.5 GB hard drive, the 3500 comes in at 4.8 lbs.
</P>
<P>
   The Mobile Expansion Unit has a second drive bay that can handle
any of the popular storage options: Zip drive, LS120, floppy drive
or an additional hard drive. It weighs 2.6 pounds, and that brings
the combined weight to 7 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   It is a minor thing, but if you travel with the docking station,
you only need the power cord. The A/C brick is built into the unit.
The brick weighs half a pound. Of course if you are traveling
without the Mobile Expansion Unit, you have to remember to bring
the brick or you will be powerless.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean to gush, but the Toshiba Portege 7000 series is the
hands-down winner, for the moment, in the thin, light, portable
docking bay sweepstakes. This system just outclasses everything
currently available.
</P>
<P>
   While looks aren't everything, this is the most stylish computer
on the market. Its silver magnesium cover and battleship gray
interior is just too cool and futuristic for words. It is not only
great looking, but strong. A colleague calls it RoboCop. Unlike the
earlier Portege models, this one has a keyboard built for my fat
fingers. The 12.1-inch TFT screen is a large enough to use for
extended periods with some degree of comfort.
</P>
<P>
   The docking station, called the CD Network Dock (you'd think
with such a cool looking device, they'd come up with something a
little sexier) has all the usual stuff but it has a mouse and
keyboard connector, two USB ports and a NTSC video out connector.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite thing about the docking station is the speakers.
These are not tinny PC speakers. You can really crank those puppies
up and hear CDs or the tanks exploding in Total Annihilation.
</P>
<P>
   When I first started traveling with a computer, the venerable
Radio Shack Model 100, people would crowd around me at the airport
and on planes wondering what that ``thing'' was. Now people know
what a laptop is and most of the people gathering around me in the
terminal on a recent trip had one. But they still crowded around,
asking, ``What's that?'' and ``Wow, that's really a cool looking
machine.'' People wanted to pick it up because they couldn't
believe how light it was. I had to be downright rude to my seat
mate, who kept asking if he could use it. ``No, it's mine, you
can't play with it,'' I whined.
</P>
<P>
   The Portege 7000 weighs 4.1 pounds and the docking station
weighs 2.5 pounds, making it 6 ounces lighter than the Armada. And
even though the Portege docking station costs nearly $600, it came
in $2 cheaper than the comparable Armada from the same retailer.
The Armada is a first-rate machine but the Portege is out there in
a class by itself.

FREE BOOK SITES HURT BY COPYRIGHT LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  By CARL S. KAPLAN 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Nov. 11, the editor of a Web site dedicated to republishing
classic works of literature online will pull the plug on his
operation.
</P>
<P>
   It is a decision he made with regret. But Eric Eldred, founder
of Eldritch Press, said he has no choice.
</P>
<P>
   Eldred's action is a protest against a little-noticed law,
signed by President Clinton this week, that adds 20 years to the
existing copyright protection of books, films, songs and other
intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   That means, for example, that copyrights on old books that were
scheduled to lapse next year, putting the works in the public
domain, will now last until 2019. Only then can people republish
them without getting the copyright owner's permission or paying
royalties.
</P>
<P>
   The law disturbs the loose-knit group of book lovers like Eldred
who have been making classic texts available online since the days
before the Web. They fear the law will have a devastating impact on
their shared goal of creating a decentralized digital library of
books in the public domain, available to students, scholars and
fans around the world at no cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new law marginalizes me and my Web site,'' said Eldred, a
computer programmer by training whose site contains the texts of
about 50 classic works, including novels by Nathaniel Hawthorne and
more obscure works such as poems by Oliver Wendell Holmes, the
Boston physician and essayist.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everything is private property forever, which is the way
things are going, then there can't be a growing, global, free
public library,'' said Eldred, who runs his small Internet press
out of his home in Derry, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, copyright protection in the United States lasted 50
years after the author's death. In the case of corporate authors,
like the Walt Disney Company, and for works published before 1978,
the copyright term was 75 years. The new law, called the Copyright
Term Extension Act, generally adds 20 years to all the old terms.
</P>
<P>
   Under the old law, Hemingway's ``Three Stories and Ten Poems,''
published in 1923, was set to enter the public domain on Jan. 1,
1999. Eldred was eager to republish that volume online. Now the
book will not enter the public domain for what seems to Eldred to
be an eternity.
</P>
<P>
   Other books published in the early 1920s whose public-domain
appearance will be similarly delayed include Kahlil Gibran's ``The
Prophet,'' A.A. Milne's ``Winnie-the-Pooh'' and Dorothy L. Sayers'
``Whose Body?'', her first novel featuring detective Lord Peter
Wimsey.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the new law, including book publishers, the film
industry, music publishers and heirs of copyright owners, argued in
part that extending copyright was necessary to account for the
greater longevity of heirs and to bring American protections more
in harmony with European law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many American book publishers were concerned that they would
be at a competitive disadvantage with publishers in Europe,'' where
copyright terms are generally longer, said Allan Adler, vice
president for legal and government affairs at the Association of
American Publishers, a trade group.
</P>
<P>
   He added that there was also a sense on the part of most
publishers that they would like to continue to benefit from works
that they have promoted -- although he conceded that some
publishers who republish classic works in book form were against
copyright extension.
</P>
<P>
   Those arguments never impressed the creators and supporters of
free book sites, who say that the law upsets the balance between
the right of a work's creator to control its use for a limited time
and the right of the public to freely enjoy that work.
</P>
<P>
   Michael S. Hart, director of Project Gutenberg, one of the
largest online free book sites with about 1,700 public-domain texts
posted by volunteers, figures that the new law will essentially
prevent about one million books from entering the public domain
over the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thankfully, a lot of stuff which entered the public domain
this year squeaked by'' before the new law was passed, he said. The
books that ``just made it'' include James Joyce's ``Ulysses,''
``The Man Who Knew Too Much'' by G. K. Chesterton and Samuel
Butler's translation of ``The Odyssey'' -- all published in 1922.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my dreams I cried about the new law,'' said Hart, a
professor at Benedictine University in Lisle, Ill., and a visiting
scientist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pa. He said
he will not close his site but will increase his efforts to scout
out and post books published before 1923. ``I'm going to post 72
books today, just to say, 'Take that!'''
</P>
<P>
   John Mark Ockerbloom, editor of The On-Line Books Page, an index
site that links to about 8,000 public-domain books posted by
individuals and groups around the world, said he was ``disappointed
and full of grief'' about the new law, though, like Hart, he said
it emboldened him to continue his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'd love to see is some notion of conservancy in the book
community akin to nature conservancy,'' Ockerbloom said. ``Maybe
wealthy people could buy the online rights to a book and donate
them to a digital republisher, who could make the book available to
the world for free,'' he said. ``I don't know if that is going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Eldred of Eldritch Press is a former medical technician who went
back to Harvard, his alma mater, to study computing several years
ago. He said in an interview that he got involved in the digital
publishing of public-domain books as a hobby in 1995. ``The book I
started with was 'The Scarlet Letter,' by Hawthorne,'' he said.
``My three daughters were reading it in high school.''
</P>
<P>
   Eldred said his site gets about 3,000 hits a day from readers
who download the books to their hard drives for later reading. He
said his readers live all over the world, and many of them reside
far from libraries. Eldred is passionate about the Internet's
ability to preserve literature for future generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember the novel 'Fahrenheit 451,' where people became books
to preserve literature?'' Eldred said. ``Well, I am Hawthorne on
the Internet. I am Oliver Wendell Holmes. If these guys are going
to be preserved, someone has to scan their works and put them on''
the Internet, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eldred said he made up his mind to discontinue his site a few
weeks ago as a small protest ``to the public domain being
savaged.'' He said he felt he could not do otherwise, given his
belief in the importance of the public's access to its cultural
heritage. He said he would donate his digital public-domain library
to other free book sites on the Web after he closes shop on
November 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everything becomes pay-per-view, then the world is
diminished,'' Eldred said. ``That really is what is happening.''

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies. Ratings and running times are in
parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `AMERICAN HISTORY X,' starring Edward Norton and Edward Furlong.
Directed by Tony Kaye (R, 118 minutes). Flawed but gut-slugging,
renounced by its director yet still a showcase for his effective,
in-your-face style, this story of a neo-Nazi skinhead who develops
a heart of gold presses every possible hot button. And its toughest
images stick even when its lurid self-aggrandizing, presented in
the ersatz poetic idiom of videos and commercials, spins out of
control. In a show of De Niro-like fury and versatility, Norton
plays a savage, racist killer who learns the error of his ways
through simple-minded but brutally effective plot devices, and
through trying to protect his younger brother ( Furlong). Hotheaded
and sensationalistic, but startlingly tough. (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `ANTZ,' starring the voices of Woody Allen and Sharon Stone.
Directed by Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson (PG, 83 minutes). Computer
animation has advanced to the point where it can make a cute
romantic couple out of Allen and Ms. Stone. This and other surreal
tricks are shown off in a funny, ingeniously animated insect
picture that often reaches the anthropomorphic cleverness of ``Toy
Story'' and shows off Allen's sharpest comic timing with
one-liners. But ``Antz'' winds up overplotted in bizarrely
grandiose ways, with the threat of genocide invoked for a jarring
change of pace. Must every child-friendly adventure film, even one
with considerable potential to delight grown-ups, boil down to a
struggle for world domination? Surely a threat of bug spray in the
picnic basket would have done the trick. (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `APT PUPIL,' directed by Bryan Singer. Starring Ian McKellen and
Brad Renfro (R, 100 minutes). Adapted from the Stephen King novella
collection that seems to have been written under a lucky star (it
also yielded ``Stand by Me'' and ``The Shawshank Redemption''),
this is a handsomely made film by the director of ``The Usual
Suspects,'' with some of the same misanthropic chill. But the
deftness with which Singer stages a war of nerves between an aged
Nazi and a cruelly inquisitive high school boy is more impressive
than the story itself, which loses much of its novelty as it goes
along. (Eventually, somebody is killed in a basement with a
shovel.) McKellen, who can also be seen playing a deeper role in
``Gods and Monsters,'' brings all his ingenuity to playing the
shrewd old war criminal, but there's nobody here to like. (Janet
Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `BELOVED,' starring Oprah Winfrey, Danny Glover, Thandie Newton
and Kimberly Elise. Directed by Jonathan Demme (R, 172 minutes). A
transfixing, deeply felt adaptation of Toni Morrison's novel, with
all the complexity (and occasional opacity) that entails. Taking on
the most enticing yet daunting job of literary adaptation since
``The English Patient,'' Jonathan Demme succeeds in bringing the
novel's pulse to the screen. Though it begins too slowly and
literally, this daring effort escalates into a gripping,
imaginative film that mixes memories of slavery with the occult and
that isn't quite like any other. Its linchpin, Ms. Winfrey, is more
often a person acting than an intuitive actress. But she plays her
character, a onetime slave literally haunted by her past, with
enough presence to hold the film together. The other major
performances are extraordinary, especially Ms. Newton's in the
bizarre title role. (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE CELEBRATION,' directed by Thomas Vinterberg (R, 100
minutes). Working under a set of self-imposed restrictions that are
meant to return filmmaking to a fundamental honesty, this Danish
director shows off dazzling ingenuity. The story of a family
reunion that becomes a psyche-bashing blowout is told with a
hand-held camera, without any special lighting or props or sound,
and the effect is invigorating rather than austere. Imaginative
angles, nimble editing and agile camera work keep the film spinning
as a large Danish cast makes the festivities seem utterly real. The
central drama is Shakespeare for the tell-all age, as a patriarch
is haunted by past sins and vengeful children. ``It is quite a job
being toastmaster tonight,'' says one partygoer, putting it mildly.
(Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `THE CRUISE,' starring Timothy (Speed) Levitch. Directed and
produced by Bennett Miller (not rated; 76 minutes). Levitch, the
loquacious subject of Miller's fascinating documentary, is a
Manhattan tour-bus guide who happens also to be a sidewalk
philosopher, improvisatory poet and walking encyclopedia of New
York City history. More than anything, he is a free spirit.
Although he can be irritating at times, Levitch is a true original,
an erudite, intellectual version of a classic motor-mouthed New
York cabby. As he interweaves his personal story between spiels
about New York City landmarks, the city (beautifully photographed
in black and white) seems to come as alive as the man who is
describing it. (Stephen Holden)
</P>
<P>
   `GODS AND MONSTERS,' starring Ian McKellen and Brendan Fraser.
Directed by Bill Condon (not rated, 105 minutes). In a performance
that well deserves to be remembered at year's end, McKellen becomes
the deliciously urbane James Whale, playing the gay
``Frankenstein'' director late in life. Shaken by the after-effects
of a mild stroke, this Whale finds his past coming back to greet
him just as the present offers new fascination, in the Adonis-like
form of the gardener ( Fraser, also fine) whom Whale finds mowing
his lawn. This beautifully acted, witty and heart-tugging film,
from a book by Christopher Bram, imagines what Whale's final days
may have been like while shaping a splendid character study, and a
droll portrait of closeted gay Hollywood. Lynn Redgrave provides
ballast and comic relief as Whale's perpetually scandalized
housekeeper. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `HAPPINESS,' starring Jane Adams and Dylan Baker. Directed by
Todd Solondz (not rated; 135 minutes). In a much bigger film than
his ``Welcome to the Doll House,'' this audacious, deadpan
filmmaker explores loneliness in his murderously funny fashion.
Outrageous touches _ none more so than its title _ come easily to
``Happiness,'' and so do the dark secrets that would surely have
brought it an NC-17 rating. No point in cataloguing this film's
perverse details: what emerges most clearly is a ruthless yet
tender portrait of suburban characters seeking romance, captured
with enough acid precision to make this a ``Bob and Carol and Ted
and Alice'' for totally dysfunctional times. Ms. Adams plays the
dartboard in a three-sister family with hilarious tremulousness.
Baker's gutsy portrayal of a bland-seeming pederast who is also a
respected doctor and a loving father is impossible to forget
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL,' directed by and starring Roberto Benigni
(PG-13, 122 minutes). Italy's most antic funnyman dares to find
humor and tenderness in the midst of the Holocaust, and his risk
pays off. This Cannes prize-winner is as stubbornly entertaining as
its central character, a Jewish waiter named Guido who jokes his
way through the nightmare for the sake of his loved ones. Daring
also to combine an opening hour of romance and pranks with a more
somber second act, Benigni avoids all traces of the maudlin and
effectively creates a situation in which comedy is courage. In this
unpretentious, enormously likable film, he shines as a father whose
fibs and hilarious buffoonery know no bounds, and no fear. (Janet
Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `LIVING OUT LOUD,' starring Holly Hunter, Danny DeVito and Queen
Latifah. Directed by Richard LaGravenese (R, 102 minutes). Making
his directorial debut, this sensitive screenwriter remains very
much a writer, constructing a talky, introspective character study
laced with flights of musical fantasy. Ms. Hunter stiffly but
passionately plays a newly divorced woman trying to reinvent her
life. DeVito is warmly credible as a lonely elevator man who cares
for her. Queen Latifah is the film's most attention-getting figure,
in the small but glamorous role of a torchy nightclub singer.
Would-be Chekhovian touches abound in this story of lonely people,
but they don't make it jell. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `PECKER,' starring Edward Furlong, Christina Ricci, Martha
Plimpton and Lili Taylor. Directed by John Waters (R, 87 minutes).
Waters, the Trash King of Baltimore, does his best to puncture New
York art-world pretensions in a film whose biggest joke is its
title, though plenty of winking smaller jokes are here, too.
``Flavor of Month Causes Tizzy in Art World'' reads a headline
summarizing the career of the title character, a Baltimore
shutterbug who just won't quit snapping friends and neighbors. In
the film, fame and fortune threaten Pecker's trashy esthetic and
gross-out chic. Waters' own style hasn't had to sacrifice these at
all. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `PLEASANTVILLE,' starring Tobey Maguire, Reese Witherspoon, Joan
Allen, William H. Macy and Jeff Daniels. Directed by Gary Ross
(PG-13, 116 minutes). This cleverly executed fantasy, with a
back-to-the-future trip into the small-town, squeaky-clean paradise
of a 1950s television show, tends toward the black-and-white,
visually and otherwise. The missionary zeal with which teen-agers
from the '90s try to awaken benighted '50s types from their slumber
is an attitude that wears thin. But in the meantime there are witty
tricks integrating color into black-and-white images, and nice
little touches abound. The cast is both poignant and amusing, with
Ms. Allen especially touching as a pre-feminist housewife who's the
prime recipient of '90s hindsight. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `PRACTICAL MAGIC,' starring Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman.
Directed by Griffin Dunne (PG-13, 105 minutes). A new look for
Halloween: super-cute. In a bouncy, bubble-brained movie with the
look of a shelter magazine, it's Barbie Joins a Coven time as the
stars shake long flossy hair and play witch sisters. They flounce
through a story (based on Alice Hoffman's fanciful novel) in which
magic is for dealing with menfolk, and brooms look all too cozily
at home. Fatuous and retrograde as this is, it's also guilty fun,
especially when Dianne Wiest and Stockard Channing are on hand to
play the senior witches of this family. Aidan Quinn plays clean-cut
Right without casting a spell. (Janet Maslin)
</P>
<P>
   `SOLDIER,' starring Kurt Russell and Jason Scott Lee. Directed
by Paul Anderson. (R, 99 minutes). Playing a grim, futuristic human
killing machine named Todd who becomes obsolete when a new, better
model of soldier is introduced, Russell has little to do but glare
and mouth a few robotic phrases in this dreary science-fiction
adventure film. When Todd is dumped on a planet whose inhabitants
are a bunch of hardy, peaceable refugees from a crashed spaceship,
``Soldier'' becomes as mushy and preposterous as ``The Postman.''
The last third is devoted to tedious battle sequences as Todd
disposes of the new breed of soldiers and faces off with their
glowering leader. ( Lee) (Holden)
</P>
<P>
   `WHAT DREAMS MAY COME,' starring Robin Williams, Cuba Gooding
Jr. and Annabella Sciorra. Directed by Vincent Ward (R, 106
minutes). If the Gothic-romantic special effects in this turgid pop
fable set in the afterlife are some of the trippiest ever devised
for a serious drama, this sudsy fantasy about married soul mates
who meet after death never comes emotionally alive. Williams is at
his fake-sincere worst as the world's most devoted husband, who
dies in a car crash and goes to heaven. Ms. Sciorra is simply blank
as the wife who commits suicide and must be rescued from hell.
Gooding, glaringly miscast, plays Williams' angelic guide. (Stephen
Holden)

GLENN, WIFE SEALED HIS DEPARTURE WITH LUCKY PACK OF CHEWING GUM 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Through the years, John and Annie Glenn have shared a little
ritual.
</P>
<P>
   When as a Marine Corps aviator he was ordered away from home for
combat, test pilot duties and later to train as a Mercury
astronaut, Glenn would playfully tell his wife he was just going to
the corner store for a pack of chewing gum.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of his Oct. 29 liftoff aboard the shuttle Discovery,
the 77-year-old Glenn revived the practice, this time handing his
wife of 55 years a pack of Doublemint gum.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the last thing he handed me,'' Annie Glenn said
Thursday as she and the couple's two children, David and Lyn,
prepared for their famous husband and father's return to Earth.
``It was very emotional. I didn't have any idea he was going to
give it to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Glenn family made a quick pact. After dad lands at the
Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Saturday, each member of the
family will take a stick of the gum and chew it. The fifth piece
will be shared by David's wife, Karen, and Glenn's two teen-age
grandsons, Zachary and Daniel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait to chew it,'' said Annie Glenn. The family of the
elderly astronaut has closely followed the orbital phase of his
flight from Houston.
</P>
<P>
   They have exchanged electronic mail with Glenn, followed the
shuttle's developments on NASA television and participated in one
live but private audio-visual exchange with their famous family
member from mission control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel 100 percent better than I did one week ago,'' said
Annie Glenn, recalling Discovery's launching. ``At that time, I was
scared. I was really excited for John. Now, I can say the day after
tomorrow I will be able to touch him, and that is very special for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn made history on Feb. 20, 1962, when he became the first
American to orbit the Earth, a distinction that made NASA reluctant
to launch him again. Initially, Glenn's family objected to his
plans to end a 24-year career in the U.S. Senate with an encore
mission.
</P>
<P>
   As the riskiest phase of her husband's liftoff, the two-minute
thrusting of the shuttle's powerful solid fuel boosters, safely
passed, Annie Glenn wept.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing wrong with that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was 75 percent of my anxiety,'' David Glenn, a California
physician said about blastoff. ``I will feel a whole lot better
when he's back on Earth, but at this point I have not been losing a
lot of sleep. It's great to see him up there having a great time.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn has done well physically by all accounts, though NASA
protects the medical privacy of its astronauts unless their
conditions warrant a change in mission plans. The Discovery crew
has not missed an assignment and is on target to complete all 83
experiments included in their nine-day flight.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Glenn sounded eager to stay up longer, a possibility
NASA is not considering unless bad weather prevents the scheduled
landing Saturday
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish it could last another week,'' said Glenn. ``I miss
Annie, obviously, and the rest of my family, but we are doing a lot
of good work up here.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Glenns, there are stark contrasts and some similarities
between his solo five-hour Mercury mission of 1962 and his longer
shuttle flight.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six years ago, Annie Glenn and her two children
sequestered themselves in their Virginia home with a few neighbors,
all glued to a trio of televisions loaned to them so they could
watch the three networks of the day simultaneously. The stress of
waiting for liftoff through 10 postponements caused her to lose
weight.
</P>
<P>
   Annie Glenn has long since overcome a severe stuttering problem
that kept her from speaking publicly as she did on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``People thought I was shy,'' she recalled. ``I was not shy. I
just could not talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Now an activist for speech therapy, Annie Glenn characterizes
herself, as ``like a butterfly out of the cocoon.''
</P>
<P>
   A Minnesota counselor and artist, Lyn Glenn has welcomed the
change in the way her family has experienced her father's latest
flight, especially the opportunity to share in the drama with the
families of Discovery's other crew members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to see dad so much more than I ever imagined,''
said Lyn Glenn. Opportunities included a walk with him on a
secluded Florida beach before launch and a spirited meal with the
crew families.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so intimate and personal. That is the sort of thing
that made a difference for me,'' said Lyn Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   The Glenn family said they have been overwhelmed by the
outpouring of public interest in Discovery's flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has amazed me is all of the attention he is getting,''
said Annie Glenn. ``I wasn't prepared for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore is among the captivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a proud nation and a proud world watching you,'' Gore
told Discovery commander Curt Brown and his crew on Thursday.
``We're proud of each and every one of you.'' &QL;

NOW WHAT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In politics, what a difference four years makes.
What goes up can come down.
</P>
<P>
   Now what?
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Old Party has only itself to blame. If its leaders
don't move toward the middle, in two years the GOP could lose
control of Congress as well as flub the presidency again.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows what the election was NOT about. It is tougher to
pin down just why the Republicans blew it, beyond underestimating a
general public tendency not to throw bombshells or otherwise upset
the governmental apple cart. The new Congress will roughly resemble
the old one, divided and polarized but not in a revolutionary mood.
</P>
<P>
   The election wasn't about Bill and Monica. The exit polls
confirm that a solid majority of voters neither want to see the
president impeached nor hear anything more about the whole tawdry
mess.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Nixon administration's Watergate crimes in
1974, Republicans lost 47 House seats and four Senate seats. By
helping Democrats hold their own this year, voters demonstrated
they simply do not think lying about sex is a constitutional abuse
of power _ on the order of Nixon's abuses _ amounting to an
impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, rebuffed on sex issue, are nonetheless stuck
with House Judiciary Committee hearings on impeachment that are now
clearly a political liability. They will rush through them as
rapidly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, the process must go forward. There has
already been so much rhetoric condemning Clinton's sins that the
legislators cannot simply drop the subject.
</P>
<P>
   With a 12-seat margin, GOP control in the House is now so
razor-thin that the Democrats can block an impeachment
recommendation if only a few Republicans join them. That reality
makes a compromise settlement likely, punishing Clinton somehow but
stopping short of kicking him out of office.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton is never going to be on the ballot again anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The big story of this election is that the Republican Party now
faces a difficult choice: to go further to the right to consolidate
its base or to make a stronger effort to appeal to ambivalent
voters in the middle of the political spectrum. The two choices are
not compatible.
</P>
<P>
   It is time party leaders decided that the religious right has
worn out its welcome and should no longer dictate huge chunks of
national GOP policy.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike four years ago, the once-dominant troops of the Christian
right, who are the core voters of conservatism, were largely
missing in action this time. They didn't vote Republican in enough
numbers to carry the day for hard-right ideological GOP candidates,
all of whom but one lost their statewide contests.
</P>
<P>
   (The single right-wing winner, Peter Fitzgerald, beat Illinois
Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun, who was so unpopular that Mickey Mouse
could have defeated her).
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, 67 percent of those voters who identified themselves as
religious conservatives voted for Republicans. But on Tuesday only
54 percent did so, splitting their votes with Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   To galvanize that base, House Speaker Newt Gingrich and other
GOP congressional leaders had authorized an idiotic last-minute
television advertising campaign meant to turn the election into a
referendum on Clinton's morals. The anti-Clinton pitch backfired,
provoking angry minority voters and members of pro-Clinton union
households to go to the polls in record numbers. And it turned out
that the religious right wasn't any more driven to impeach Clinton
than the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, a massive turnout by the religious right got
political credit for handing control of both houses of Congress to
the Republicans. Their support encouraged GOP leaders to commit the
party to an intolerant ideological agenda of social issues beloved
by the right but opposed by most voters.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the Christian Coalition and similar groups
complain that Republican leaders have not paid enough attention to
their favorite issues, including criminalization of abortion, a ban
on flag-burning and mandated school prayer. Gingrich and others
have periodically demanded such legislation but have never mustered
the votes to win congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, kowtowing to the far right has cost the GOP support
among moderates who resist the notion that morality can be rigidly
codified in law in a nation as diverse as ours.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of the GOP problem is the 1996 platform plank that would
outlaw abortion without even an exception to save the life of the
mother-to-be. If left unchanged, this plank will hurt any GOP
presidential candidate, who would have to appeal to voters in
pro-choice states like California and New York. Did the GOP notice
that Colorado and Washington state just defeated initiatives to ban
late-term abortions, about which the most controversy swirls?
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, Gingrich and others are
blaming the party's lack of a positive agenda for their
disappointing showing. But the problem is not so much the lack of
an agenda as the fact that they espouse the wrong one.
</P>
<P>
   Initially the GOP seems to be sticking to old familiar themes _
the vague ``family values'' of the religious right, opposition to
abortion, indiscriminate tax cuts, smaller government, vouchers to
force taxpayers to subsidize private schools, an end to affirmative
action. They still oppose restrictions on the tobacco industry and
campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   If their reaction is to merely reframe the message rather than
change its substance, they still don't get it.

`MAMA FLORA'S FAMILY': A RELATIVE OF `ROOTS,' IN THE SOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Program notes are at the end of review. Time, channel are
for the New York area. Please check local listings.) 
(af) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The proper old lady sitting on the bus is clearly riding in from
the past, with her Sunday hat, neat white gloves and perfect
posture. Arriving in Baltimore in 1970, Flora (Cicely Tyson) hauls
her drunken granddaughter, Diana (Queen Latifah) and Diana's
toddler son back to the wholesome air of Stockton, Tenn., where she
will restore their bodies and spirits and tell the
multi-generational tale that is ``Mama Flora's Family.''
</P>
<P>
   To appreciate this swift, engaging mini-series (shown Sunday and
Tuesday on CBS), it helps to cast off its heavy excess baggage. As
it follows Flora from the turn of the century and her girlhood in a
Mississippi shack to the 1970s, it evokes the family-epic genre of
Alex Haley's ``Roots.''
</P>
<P>
   The fictional Flora is descended from the people in ``Roots'' in
a more substantial way, too. The new mini-series is based on an
unfinished novel, inspired by his maternal relatives, that Haley
left behind when he died in 1992. (Completed by David Stevens, the
book was published last month.)
</P>
<P>
   And as the brave black woman who strolls through some of the
highlights of the century, Ms. Tyson can't help but call to mind
her more groundbreaking role in ``The Autobiography of Miss Jane
Pittman.''
</P>
<P>
   These burdens don't help ``Mama Flora's Family,'' which is not
especially original or ambitious. On its own modest terms, though,
it is far more satisfying than most mini-series. Terrifically cast
and acted, it is best at charting the family dynamics that swirl
around Flora: the misunderstandings, the rivalries, the way
characters take shape.
</P>
<P>
   The most gripping and fleshed-out character, and the most
remarkable performance, comes from Blair Underwood as Flora's son
Willie, who goes from a zoot-suited gambler to a World War II hero
to a put-upon janitor trying mightily to provide for his family and
getting angrier every minute.
</P>
<P>
   The mini-series is weaker when it tries to chart the panorama of
history. Mama Flora gets up one morning in the 60s and decides to
integrate the local coffee shop, which she does with relatively
little trouble.
</P>
<P>
   As Flora tells her story, the film flashes back and forth in
time, too often and abruptly. The device allows Ms. Tyson to return
to the screen frequently even in the early sections when Flora is a
young woman, played strongly by Erika Alexander, who helps take the
character past the predictable writing.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents are tenant farmers on a plantation owned by a
wealthy black family, the Flemings. After the naive Flora is
seduced by the plantation owner's handsome son, Lincoln (Shemar F.
Moore), she gives birth to a boy who is immediately taken from her
to be raised by the Flemings. (In true mini-series style, the son
will eventually return.)
</P>
<P>
   The distance between rich and impoverished blacks is a striking
though underdeveloped theme in this section. Flora's own father
calls her seducer ``Massa Lincoln.'' And Lincoln coldly says of the
baby, ``With so much high yellow blood in some pickaninny, the
child could become an embarrassment if it grows up in the wrong
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   As Flora ages and Ms. Tyson takes over, the character becomes
even more sentimental and predictable. She marries a black man who
is killed by whites after he steals to feed his family. Alone, she
raises their son, Willie, and a niece, and is heartbroken when
Willie drops out of school to get a job.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of Tuesday's installment, Flora rediscovers the son
she was forced to give up. Luke, a successful lawyer, is played by
Mario Van Peebles, and the casting of him and Underwood as brothers
is one of the series' inspired choices.
</P>
<P>
   Though Luke's role as the rich, educated brother is too skimpily
written, these two actors create a trenchant sense of the
resentment and jealousy between Flora's sons. Where Luke turns his
anger outward on racist society, Willie tears himself apart over
his failure to provide a better life for his family.
</P>
<P>
   In this often schematic tale, Underwood brings unexpected
complexity to his portrait of a man who sometimes blames himself
and sometimes turns his fury on those he loves. Most difficult for
Willie to take, he finds himself helplessly caught in situations
(wrongly accused of a liquor store robbery) that his educated,
distant brother must help him out of.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tyson is dignified if unsurprising. Queen Latifah offers
fresh energy and an amazingly accomplished performance, making
Diana tough and believable even when the script lets her down with
trite scenes about her romance with a Black Panther. Flawed though
it is, this mini-series offers so much to savor that it is a happy
exception in a season of duds. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Hit the road, Jack.
</P>
<P>
   Some District of Columbia residents sang that old tune Thursday
as they delivered a basket full of sarcastic goodies and a one-way
bus ticket home to Sen. Lauch Faircloth, R-N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man came up here and trampled over our democracy,'' said
77-year-old Loree Murray, who wore a plastic pig snout and a ``Free
D.C.'' sign and cap to show her disdain for Faircloth, a
millionaire hog farmer.
</P>
<P>
   Faircloth, who was ousted in Tuesday's election by Raleigh
attorney John Edwards, was the architect of legislation last year
that stripped control of most government agencies from the D.C.
mayor and gave it to a federally appointed control board.
</P>
<P>
   Faircloth has made no secret of his strong dislike for the
district's outgoing, flamboyant mayor, Marion Barry, whom Faircloth
blamed for turning ``the capital city into a national joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry, in turn, likened Faircloth to the Southern
segregationists in Congress who, half a century ago, ran the city
like a private plantation.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, originally from Pinehurst, N.C., said Faircloth forgot
Barry was an elected official.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Faircloth) has spent all his time and energy attacking our
mayor _ a man who we freely elected. He (Faircloth) acted against
the will of D.C. residents,'' she said. Earlier this year, Murray
joined 13 bus loads of district residents who traveled to
Faircloth's home in Clinton, N.C., to protest his district
policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called all my friends and relatives in North Carolina and
asked them to vote against him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Leading Thursday's harsh bon voyage was Timothy Cooper, a member
of the Stand up for Democracy Coalition, a group of D.C. residents
who favor home rule and have lobbied against Faircloth's district
policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new day for the District of Columbia. This
(Faircloth's defeat) is the first step in achieving full rights
under the law,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   About 25 district residents echoed similar sentiments outside of
the Hart Senate office building. A few carried signs and wore
plastic pig snouts _ which they had to leave outside or put away
before heading up to Faircloth's office.
</P>
<P>
   The office was locked, allowing the group to merely peer through
its glass doors. No one could be seen inside, so the group left the
Greyhound bus ticket along with a gift basket outside the glass
doors.
</P>
<P>
   According to Cooper, the basket included ``Marion Barry''
preserves, a ``chocolate turkey from Chocolate City,'' jerk sauce
for ``pork down on the farm'' and Foggy Bottom beer for Faircloth
``to drown his sorrows.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman was unavailable for comment Thursday at Faircloth's
Washington office.
</P>
<P>
   While ecstatic about Faircloth's departure, the residents were
not happy about Faircloth's possible replacement as head of the
Senate subcommittee that oversees district spending _ Sen. Kay
Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she would be even worse than Faircloth,'' said John
Capozzi, a member of the Stand for Democracy group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a moderate Republican,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison, who already is a member of the subcommittee, would
impose her views on the district, Cooper said. If she gets
appointed, Cooper said the group would ``make some noise.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey Parham, a spokeswoman for Hutchison, said Thursday that
it is too soon to know whether Hutchison would be offered the
position, but that ``if it does come, she will take it and she will
want to make a positive contribution.''

COMMENTARY: KILLING U.N. INSPECTION  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By A.M. ROSENTHAL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.N. arms inspection system in Iraq is near death. Even if
Saddam Hussein lifts his new bans on inspection imposed three
months ago, Iraq and its friends at the United Nations have so
eviscerated the system that there is no realistic hope it can be
revived, with or without bombing, except as a thin facade.
</P>
<P>
   These realities are held secret at the United Nations because so
many bureaucrats and member nations share responsibility for what
is happening. Some countries, like Russia and France, eviscerate
quite openly; others, like the United States, use the hidden knife
of apathy. During election campaigns, we don't bother to talk about
it.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past days a few intimately informed U.N. people have
been willing to reveal these truths about the fate of the hunt for
Saddam's stockpiles of chemical, nuclear and biological weapons and
his plans to build ever more. They are not ready yet to go public,
as have Scott Ritter and David Kay of the U.S. and David Kelly of
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   By daily harassment and trickery, Saddam tried to prevent arms
inspection for the first six years after it was put in place by the
victors in the gulf war, to contain his power and dreams. But
inspection worked anyway. Without it, his weapons would be in use
by selected terrorists around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The inspectorate found 21 nuclear facilities that Iraq denied
existed. Warheads loaded with anthrax and botulinum, evidence of
VX, 400,000 liters of chemical agents, missiles, two million liters
of precursors used in making chemical weapons, lists of foreign
suppliers of death, a whole inventory from hell.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago inspectors drew close to more weapons, and weapons
programs, more foreign supply lines. So Saddam started his endgame.
</P>
<P>
   First he limited inspectors to four to a site. Then he put a
choke collar on inspectors _ where they could go with how much
advance notice, where they could never go. Then in October 1997 he
banned inspection altogether, as if the United Nations did not
exist; a reasonable attitude for a dictator with good friends
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan flew off to Baghdad in February
1998 to make a Saddam-appeasing deal, including allusions of
lifting sanctions. The United States approved, and warned Saddam _
do it again, we clobber you.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions hurt Iraqi civilians. But everybody knew Saddam could
end sanctions whenever he wished. All he had to do was reveal his
weapons of mass destruction; the agreement in 1991 was that he do
it within 15 days.
</P>
<P>
   Annan and the Security Council pretended that lifting the
sanctions was Iraq's major goal. That was world-class cynicism.
Anthrax, VX, missiles _ those goals Saddam cherishes over all of
Iraq's children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can do business with him,'' said Annan. He did _ until Aug.
5, five months later, when Saddam ordered U.N. inspectors out,
again.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration did nothing for three months. Now
there is serious talk of ``using'' Annan again! This would be one
more evisceration _ of the major-power responsibility on which the
United Nations was founded. Meanwhile Defense Secretary William
Cohen tries to get support for possible bombing of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, even two years ago, bombing might have made
Saddam permit real inspection again. Now, if bombing comes, he will
let the inspectors back for awhile, in confidence of his
controlling knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   International arms inspection is not just snooping around a
suspected site. It is a continuous complex of gathering information
from intelligence and commercial sources everywhere, scientific
analyses, laboratories, amassing data banks on Iraq's foreign
suppliers and pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   The information about U.N. inspection methods that Iraqi
specialists have collected by harassing, disrupting and banning
cannot be bombed out of their heads, or the new hiding places
Saddam now has created at home these past few years and in very
friendly nations abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists write as if what we report is the whole universe of
the story. Generally we do not mention the existence of what we do
not know, often the most important information.
</P>
<P>
   I do not know how, when or if arms inspection can be repaired
without obliteration of Saddam and his regime. And I do not know
when Americans will realize that the next terrorist explosion in
their country might suffocate a million people, and therefore is
worth talking about, even during a political campaign.

ANTIQUES: A MAGAZINE GIVES ITS PICKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Great Britain)  (mk) 
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has just become easier to buy important lots at auction.
</P>
<P>
   A new magazine, The Boulay 300, published its first issue this
week. It is a 50-page, by-subscription-only guide that promises to
identify the 300 most important lots of antiques and works of art
at auction all over the world in a given month.
</P>
<P>
   Its founder, Laure Boulay de Meurthe, is based in London. (She
was the last companion of Sir James Goldsmith, a noted collector of
art and antiques.) Ms. Boulay is also a collector of books and the
longtime publisher of the French magazine Pointe de Vue, a weekly
that covers French society.
</P>
<P>
   She described the new magazine as an appraiser of auctions,
explaining that it is a guide to the best lots being sold among
1,450 leading fine-art auction houses worldwide, including
Sotheby's, Christie's, Phillips and William Doyle Galleries.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Coorsh, the publisher of The Boulay 300, said the
magazine was to be published 10 times a year. It costs $500 for an
annual subscription. (Information: (011) 44-171-245-6826, in
London.) ``It's a magazine for collectors in general, auction
houses, museum people, anyone interested in art, because it's a
good summary of what's going on in the art world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a useful tool, particularly as more and more new
people come into the market,'' said Hugh Hildesley, executive vice
president of Sotheby's. ``The timing is very good because the
market has become so big and widespread that it will help people
sort things out. It does the groundwork for them.''
</P>
<P>
   A Christie's spokesman, Andree Corroon, said: ``It is an
excellent resource for collectors who buy at auction. Our client
base is more and more international, and clients who are not in New
York or who wish to remain anonymous bid by phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Diana Phillips, the Sotheby's spokeswoman in New York, said that
at Sotheby's 50 percent of the winning auction bids were by phone.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Page, a former editor in chief of Art &AMP; Auction magazine, is
the Boulay contributor from the United States. ```The 300' may not
all be masterpieces, but we find plenty of sleepers,'' she said.
``We censor by omission.''
</P>
<P>
   Godfrey Barker, the London-based editor in chief, who has
covered the art market worldwide since 1975, said he thought the
guide would appeal most to dealers. ``Every dealer has to do every
day what we are doing, searching out the very best at auction,'' he
said. ``But we come out ahead of the catalogs. We get our
information by torturing the auction house experts.'' He said
Sotheby's had told him that its press department was doing more
work for The Boulay 300 than it was doing for ``all the newspapers
put together.''
</P>
<P>
   Barker said, ``No dealer can match us in terms of research.''
The magazine lists the auction specialists and their telephone
numbers for each lot featured, and shows the work in color. The
auction houses supply the 300 transparencies to be shown in each
issue.
</P>
<P>
   No more than 50 percent of the items chosen are from Christie's
and Sotheby's, according to Barker. ``We are talking to auction
houses in South America and South Africa,'' he said. ``We are
covering sales in Beijing, Singapore, Mexico City, Istanbul and
Moscow. We are reaching into parts of the art market other
commentators cannot touch.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Page suggested that collectors would take advantage of the
guide. ``It's something to help busy people make decisions,'' she
said. ``We would not mention a sale that has nothing special in
it.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Nov. 24 sale at Christie's in New York, where French and
English antiques from the New York gallery French &AMP; Co. will be
auctioned, the magazine cites a pair of Louis XVI ormolu-mounted
Egyptian alabaster vases, circa 1770, that carry an estimate of $1
million to $1.5 million. The listing reports that the design is
attributed to Francois-Joseph Belanger and that the ormolu mounts
were executed by Pierre Gouthiere, one of the masters of the age.
The vases were bought by Louis XVI in 1782. The text also has a key
fact: what the pair went for the last time they were auctioned
($520,000, at Christie's in London in 1992).
</P>
<P>
   And what are Ms. Page's criteria for including a work in the
magazine? ``Rarity, condition and that oft-neglected category,
beauty,'' she said. After covering the market for 16 years, she
added, she also considers ``sheer quirkiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Some comments are hilarious. One listing, for Friday's sale of
20th-century British art at Christie's in London, includes a 1950
oil painting by L.S. Lowry, ``Father and Two Sons,'' which has an
estimate of $680,000 to $1.02 million. The magazine's commentary
reads as follows: ``This is grim stuff. We celebrate Lowry as the
only 20th-century British artist to address head-on the awfulness
of life in polluted, smoky cities and we admire his controlled
nostalgia and stoic humor in the face of so much suffering.'' It
then concludes, ``Important to any survey of Lowry, it is unlikely
to be popular at $680,000 plus.''
</P>
<P>
   Other listings pick out works many might overlook. The
highlighted lot of the Nov. 16 sale of Impressionist, contemporary
and modern paintings at Phillips in New York is a large painting of
the Champs-Elysees in winter by Jean-Francois Raffaelli. When asked
about the listing, a Phillips specialist, Guillaume Duhamel,
admitted that the picture was probably the ``sleeper'' in the sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``The painting is the most beautiful Raffaelli I've ever seen on
the market,'' he said. ``It's in the artist's later Impressionistic
style.'' The estimate is $130,000 to $160,000.
</P>
<P>
   Asked his criteria, Barker insisted that monetary value was
irrelevant. He said a work of art must ``have quality and be
supreme of its type.'' He pointed out that half of the listings
would be works costing under $20,000. ``In some fields, like
Chinese and Japanese works of art, supreme quality can be found for
$10,000,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher said the target audience was 10,000 people.

   Interactive Collector
</P>
<P>
   There is a new free Internet guide to auctions that covers sales
at most auction houses except for Christie's and Sotheby's. The
Interactive Collector (www.icollector.com) is a London-based
resource for buying and selling art, antiques and collectibles, and
it seems to focus on more affordable things.
</P>
<P>
   It is still experiencing birthing pains (not all the items for
sale have been photographed), but it is comprehensive, ranging from
Bonnards to knicknacks. James Corsellis, the 28-year-old managing
director, said he had signed up 133 auction houses and 64 art
galleries, and has a database with more than 3,000 items in 41
categories, from antiquities to stamps and coins.
</P>
<P>
   His strategy is to get Bonhams, Phillips and all the second-tier
auction houses around the world linked online, forming a critical
mass to attract serious buyers and sellers.
</P>
<P>
   The current auction, which ends at 1 p.m. on Thursday, is a
selection of 250 items from 13 houses around the world, from
platinum earrings ($1,500 to $3,000) to Titanic postcards from 1912
($450 to $650).

   NEW YORK _ After two months of reworking, four weeks of previews
and $2 million in corporate largesse, ``The Scarlet Pimpernel''
re-emerged on Wednesday to beaming investors, supportive reviews
and a revitalized box office.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, ticket sales in the first three hours were about
$70,000, the producers said, compared with $60,000 all day last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   For backers, including the giant Cablevision, the apparent
success may create some curious problems.
</P>
<P>
   First is how to market the new version without implying that the
previous show was old and tired.
</P>
<P>
   The show's executive producer, Tim Hawkins, said advertising,
much of it aimed at the suburbs, would try to ``communicate `new
and improved' without saying that,'' and without specifically
mentioning the overhaul. To stem the potential hard feelings of
those who saw the previous version _ and to boost sales _ this week
producers began offering discounted $45 tickets to previous
customers through direct mail.
</P>
<P>
   There may be a new cast album. As for the Tonys, Hawkins said
the producers had not decided whether to pursue a special citation.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, producers seem (almost) content. ``We have a
version that we're very proud of,'' Hawkins said. ``And it's a
version that's set. For now.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is rare that an artist's entire body of work
creates a stir on Broadway. But when the body is Nicole Kidman's,
people will talk.
</P>
<P>
   The question was simple: Will Ms. Kidman, arriving on Nov. 27 in
David Hare's ``Blue Room,'' appear nude, as she did in the London
production, or in more modest attire?
</P>
<P>
   The speculation was apparently set off by an article on Monday
in The New York Post, which reported that Ms. Kidman would appear
in ``only a see-through body stocking'' when the show moves into
the Cort Theater. For the uninitiated, a body stocking is a thin,
full-body sheath, usually made of Lycra, fine netting or something
called jumbo Spandex.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's essentially a glorified Capezio unitard,'' said William
Ivey Long, the costume designer of skin-saturated shows like
``Cabaret'' and ``Chicago,'' adding that the garment offers
``optical and psychological'' support. The Post report raised
eyebrows for those who had seen the show in London, where Ms.
Kidman was naked for several seconds in one scene. Were the
Americans being deemed too prim? some asked. Was Ms. Kidman just
being shy?
</P>
<P>
   No.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the show, Sam Mendes, said there were no plans
to change costuming from the London production to Broadway. ``I'm
perplexed,'' he said, ``that one very, very small piece of unerotic
nudity should cause such a fuss.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever her garb, one thing is certain: Ms. Kidman sells
tickets. As of Thursday, the three-month run was 80 percent sold
out.
</P>
<P>
   Taymor Stays Busy
</P>
<P>
   Julie Taymor is bushed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never worked so hard,'' said Ms. Taymor, in a telephone
interview from Rome, where she is filming her take on ``Titus
Andronicus.'' ``The 18-hour days are unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   And her schedule shows no signs of slacking. This week, she
announced that her next New York production would be ``The Green
Bird,'' Carlo Gozzi's commedia play about the adventures of
itinerant twins.
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds familiar, it is. Ms. Taymor originally directed
the play for the Theater for a New Audience in 1996 in a brief but
critically popular run at the New Victory Theater. This version,
once again with the Theater for a New Audience, will very likely
start rehearsals next winter, when Ms. Taymor returns from London,
where she will recreate her Broadway staging of ``The Lion King.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Green Bird'' is to open in early 2000, possibly on
Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always felt the work deserved a larger audience,'' said
Jeffrey Horowitz, artistic director of Theater for a New Audience.
``Now, because of `Lion King' and the introduction of so many
people to her work, Julie may get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the Way
</P>
<P>
   _ Cynthia Nixon will appear in the Drama Dept.'s ``Hope Is the
Thing With Feathers,'' by Frank Pugliese. The play, beginning on
Dec. 2 at the Greenwich House Theater, follows the lives of three
couples.
</P>
<P>
   _ A.R. Gurney's new play, ``Far East,'' will star Michael Hayden
as a 1950s naval officer, with Lisa Emery and Bill Smitrovich.
Performances begin on Dec. 11 at Lincoln Center's Mitzi E. Newhouse
Theater.

 &HT;    AARP program aimed at helping senior drivers
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If there had been any doubt today's senior citizens
are more mobile than in previous generations, it was removed in
landmark style by the space flight of 77-year-old John Glenn. But
Glenn is just a high-profile example of a new trend in senior
citizen behavior.
</P>
<P>
   As seniors are living longer and have more disposable income, we
find more and more of them are traveling on a regular basis. Many
of them are traveling by car. Unfortunately, statistics show this
group of drivers also has one of the highest accident rates.
</P>
<P>
   To address this issue, the American Association of Retired
Persons has initiated its 55 Alive Mature Driving program. Designed
not only to give safe-driving pointers but also to develop a bit of
introspection on the part of senior drivers, 55 Alive's goal is
reduce the accident rate among its members and at the same time
save them money on auto insurance rates.
</P>
<P>
   My friend Al, closing in on his seventh decade, recently
attended the program in Atlanta. The cost of admission was $8. He
said the course not only confirmed many beliefs but also opened his
eyes to many driving situations faced by older drivers.
</P>
<P>
   A workbook asks the driver to answer a battery of questions
relating to driving skills and situations.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, drivers over 55 do have more accidents per mile than
average. They also frequently suffer from impaired hearing or
vision. And yes, as we age, our night vision capacity diminishes.
</P>
<P>
   If older drivers restrict their driving to daylight hours only,
many insurance companies offer them a lower rate.
</P>
<P>
   Al also discovered the most frequent accident scenario for older
drivers is one that involves a left turn across traffic. His new
motto: ``Look twice, turn once.''
</P>
<P>
   Al said the course also did an excellent job of making seniors
aware of new technologies in cars, such as how anti-lock brakes
work in a panic situation or insisting a grandchild not ride in the
passenger seat of a car equipped with a passenger-side air bag.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers also learn how to use the seat height adjuster, or if it
doesn't have one, to sit on a small pillow. If you can't see out,
basically you really can't see. Using all of your mirrors can help
avoid blind spots.
</P>
<P>
   And proper maintenance is important. A roadside breakdown can be
a traumatic experience to a senior citizen.
</P>
<P>
   The course consists of two four-hour sessions on two consecutive
weeks, and completion earns a certificate that can give you a 10
percent discount with most insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, contact AARP at 1-800-424-3410 (cq) and
ask for information regarding their 55 Alive Mature Driving
program. There is a three- to four-month waiting period to get in
these classes, and as the word spreads, the wait could get longer.

 &HT;    Emory, Columbia partnership announced
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Four years ago, the proposed match looked awkward.
</P>
<P>
   On the one side was the Pac-Man of health care, Columbia/HCA,
under the acquisition-driven leadership of Richard Scott. On the
other stood the entrenched academic health center of Emory
University, making a late entry into the turbulent world of managed
care.
</P>
<P>
   The unlikely engagement was broken off months later. The
whispers centered on the inevitable culture clash between the
for-profit aggressiveness of Scott and the nonprofit tradition of
Emory.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, under different Columbia leadership and strategy,
and a different Emory structure, the courtship was renewed. And
Thursday, a joint-venture marriage between Columbia/HCA Healthcare
and Emory Healthcare was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Emory and Columbia said their agreement, signed Wednesday, would
attract managed-care contracts by offering a broad medical network
across metro Atlanta, from outpatient clinics to surgery centers to
a range of hospital services. That network would represent the
area's most comprehensive delivery system, Emory and Columbia said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a spectacular opportunity,'' said Dr. Michael
Johns, CEO of Emory Healthcare. ``We can learn a lot from
Columbia/HCA. We bring a lot to the table, and they bring a lot to
the table.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement will fold eight Columbia hospitals and five
surgery centers in the Atlanta area into a for-profit venture run
by Emory and Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Those Columbia facilities will add the Emory Healthcare name.
Emory, in fact, will also oversee the medical management and
quality assurance in those facilities, while Columbia will run the
day-to-day operational side.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the deal four years ago, which proposed a sale of Emory's
Crawford Long Hospital, ``this is not about who controls what, but
it's a partnership,'' said Dr. Johns, who will be chairman of the
joint venture.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was developed at the local Atlanta level, rather
than at Columbia headquarters in Nashville, added Frank DeMarco,
president of the company's Southeastern division. Columbia, he
said, ``is no longer an organization that is very centralized and
controlling.''
</P>
<P>
   Under new CEO Thomas Frist, Columbia has downsized its hospital
operations and sold off other assets. For more than a year, it has
been embroiled in a federal investigation into possible Medicare
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   But the joint venture won't be affected by the investigation nor
a subsequent settlement, Emory officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Emory-Columbia partnership, to go into effect early in 1999,
is expected to heighten competition for managed-care contracts with
the area's current market leader, Promina Health System.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and hospitals have aligned into such mega-systems in
order to meet the demand for low-cost care, triggered by the spread
of managed-care plans, such as HMOs and PPOs.
</P>
<P>
   And for employers and consumers, the joint venture _ and more
competition _ may lead to lower prices for medical services,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, current Emory Healthcare facilities, such
as Emory University Hospital, Crawford Long and Emory's 18
outpatient centers, will remain separate, run as always by Emory
Healthcare.
</P>
<P>
   Profits from the joint venture will be split between Emory
Healthcare and Columbia. The percentages to each organization were
not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia will continue to own its hospital and surgery
buildings, and each hospital will retain a local community board.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement just covers the Atlanta area. Emory will maintain
current relationships with affiliate hospitals across the state,
some of which compete with nearby Columbia facilities.
</P>
<P>
   In the shadow of the agreement, though, is the fast growth of
Promina, a 13-hospital alliance. ``I don't think you can ignore
Promina,'' said Charles Keaton of Columbia, who will be president
of the joint venture. ``They're the market leader. Their ability to
negotiate contracts is very strong.''
</P>
<P>
   As an academic health center, Emory has faced additional
financial pressure because of its research and teacher-training
missions. But Rein Saral, CEO of the Emory Clinic, emphasized that
the clinic and Emory's hospitals operate in the black.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about survival _ we're talking about
prevailing in the marketplace,'' Saral said.
</P>
<P>
   And Emory, with its new link to the 13 Columbia facilities,
gains in geographical reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emory needed additional access points before Promina lapped
the field,'' said Christopher Kane of consulting firm KPMG Peat
Marwick. ``Emory needs an awful lot of (patient) volume to fund
their three missions: education, research and patient care.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbia, in turn, will benefit from Emory's name and medical
expertise, Kane said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Columbia got local impact and even some national
credibility,'' which has suffered under the federal fraud
investigation, Kane said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Columbia can point at Emory and say, 'If we can do business
with a worldclass academic medical center, we should be able to do
business with anyone,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance could lead to cost efficiencies, such as supply
purchasing, Emory officials added. No staff cuts are expected at
this time.

 &HT;    Lowe's adds own tool line from Snap-On
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a new branding strategy becoming more popular with
the do-it-yourself giants, Lowe's Home Improvement Warehouse has
begun selling an exclusive retail line by Snap-On Tools.
</P>
<P>
   North Wilkesboro, N.C.-based Lowe's has formed a joint venture
with Kenosha, Wis.-based Snap-On to sell a private label line of
mechanics tools called Kobalt (cq) that will compete directly with
the Sears Craftsman brand and rival Atlanta-based Home Depot's
Husky brand tools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've carried sockets and wrenches, but we didn't have
anything like this,'' said Mark Kauffman(cq), a senior vice
president of merchandising for Lowe's. Kauffman joined dozens of
executives from Lowe's and Snap-On announcing the partnership
Thursday in Atlanta to coincide with the NAPA 500 race at Atlanta
Motor Speedway. Lowe's sponsors a NASCAR team with a company race
car.
</P>
<P>
   The Lowe's tool line is being made by Georgia manufacturer J.H.
Williams, a Columbus-based division of Snap-On.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership with Lowe's marks the first time Snap-On tools
will be sold outside of franchise dealers, who deliver the tools
directly to commercial customers. The products, which Snap-On
primarily sold to professional automobile mechanics, are being
marketed by Lowe's to the part-time enthusiasts and contractors.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 products, including wrenches, sockets and ratchets,
are being sold nationwide. The company also set up a Web site for
selling the tools, Lowe's first attempt at Internet retailing.
Rival Home Depot doesn't sell anything on its Web site, although it
has said it will eventually.
</P>
<P>
   Both Home Depot and Lowe's are aggressively lining up with
highly regarded manufacturers of private brands.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Home Depot forged a significant contract with Emerson
Tool Co. for an exclusive line of table saws, sanders and other
power products. Emerson was known for making the Sears Craftsman
power tools until Sears ended its relationship with Emerson and
took its power tool production offshore.

   &QL;  PHILADELPHIA TOPS GOP CONVENTION LIST
</P>
<P>
   By Paul Kane
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Nov. 5 -- The City of Brotherly Love will be hosting
a ``Grand Old Party'' in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Philadelphia the ``birthplace of freedom'' where the GOP
will be ``nominating a president for the new millennium'',
Republican National Committee chairman Jim Nicholson said Thursday
the city would host the party's quadrennial convention.
</P>
<P>
   To Nicholson, Philadelphia's historic attributes and the
significance of charting a course for the Republicans in the next
century made the city a logical choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these things were a combination,'' he said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Another key factor was Philadelphia's ``great facilities'',
Nicholson said, alluding to the First Union Center, which will play
host to the convention in the first week of August, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was originally expected at the end of this month,
but RNC spokesman Tim Fitzpatrick said the GOP's site selection
committee concluded its last field visit Oct. 16 in San Antonio --
and that the process went much smoother than expected, allowing for
Thursday's early announcement.
</P>
<P>
   It will have to be ratified at the RNC's annual winter meeting
in January, but that is a foregone conclusion to Nicholson and
other Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Philadelphia beat out four other finalists for
the GOP convention: New Orleans, New York, San Antonio and
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully expect to see a Republican convention in these cities
in the future,'' said Jan Larimer, chairwoman of the site selection
committee.
</P>
<P>
   But Larimer said Philadelphia had the best combination of
facilities: the First Union Center, 30,000 hotel rooms in the
Greater Philadelphia area and a mass transit system that could
handle the influx of 35,000 politicos and media types.
</P>
<P>
   And one Republican aide in Washington said Philadelphia had
another thing going for it, the decision by Nicholson to allow
Larimer's committee full sway in choosing the site. For the 1996
convention, Haley Barbour, who was RNC chairman from 1992 to 1996,
was dead set on going to San Diego because he believed it would
give the GOP nominee a better chance of capturing California's 54
electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   No such luck. Dole was trounced by President Clinton, 51 percent
to 38 percent, in California.
</P>
<P>
   But politics are still a consideration. The RNC wanted the host
city to have bipartisan support, which Philadelphia has with
Democratic Mayor Ed Rendell, Republican Gov. Tom Ridge and two GOP
senators, Arlen Specter and Rick Santorum.
</P>
<P>
   And Tuesday's easy victories by Ridge and Specter clearly didn't
hurt. ``Pennsylvania has become a great Republican state,''
Nicholson said.
</P>
<P>
   It will mark the first time the Republicans have held a
convention in the Northeast since 1948, when Philadelphia hosted
both the GOP and the Democratic conventions.
</P>
<P>
   But there will be no convention double-header this time for
Philadelphia, since the Democrats have a clause that forbids them
from having a convention in the same site as the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Rendell telephoned the Democratic National Committee early
Thursday afternoon to inform them of the Republican decision,
ending any chance Philadelphia had of hosting the Democratic
convention in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Until Thursday, Philadelphia was one of seven finalists for the
Democratic convention, and many insiders said the decision would
come down to Philadelphia or Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of speculation that those (Philadelphia and
LA) are the two frontrunners,'' said Tony Wyche, spokesman for the
DNC.
</P>
<P>
   The DNC, however, will not be making a decision until later this
winter, Wyche said. Next week, the DNC will narrow the field of
host candidates, probably to three cities, and Philadelphia was all
but certain to make that round of cuts. ``Philadelphia's going to
be a major player right until the end,'' Steve Grossman, chairman
of the DNC, said before the Republican announcement.
</P>
<P>
   So Philadelphia had to accept the Republican offer, rather than
wait a few more months to see what the Democrats decide.
</P>
<P>
   And for Rendell, who will leave office at the end of 1999,
before the 2000 convention, it didn't matter which party held a
convention -- as long as one of them did, bringing the Philadelphia
area an estimated $100 million in direct revenue and countless
millions of dollars in free advertising as the networks covered the
event.
</P>
<P>
   While some Republicans insisted that it was a nonpolitical
decision, they were already scripting how the event would unfold,
with plenty of activity centered around the Liberty Bell and
Independence Mall. Powerful political symbols that the GOP fully
intends to use to their advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to make a great back drop,'' said Fitzpatrick,
the RNC spokesman.

   NICARAGUA-MUDSLIDES (Posoltega, Nicaragua) _ Where just a week
ago there were fertile fields of corn, beans and peanuts almost
ready for harvest, there are now only discolored corpses, swelling
grotesquely in the sun. For Central America, Hurricane Mitch and
the floods and landslides that followed in the storm's wake have
been a catastrophe. But no place has been harder hit than this
collection of humble agricultural settlements, where at least 1,500
people, and perhaps many many more, perished when a series of

   ELN-DEMS-BLACKS (Atlanta) _ When it came to getting the black

gubernatorial candidate used every opportunity to get out the vote
among the city's 300,000 black households. Those efforts were
rewarded Tuesday. Across much of the South, where Democrats won
some of their most significant victories in years, the same pattern
emerged. By Kevin Sack.

<P>
   FED-GREENSPAN (Washington) _ Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve
chairman, says that investors and lenders are less fearful of
global financial turmoil, suggesting that the central bank is less
concerned now that a shortage of credit could derail the economy,
and thus that the Fed might see less need to reduce interest rates
again at its next policy meeting on Nov. 17. But the inadvertent
release Thursday by the Labor Department of employment data for
October, showing that the economy is gradually slowing, reinforced
the case for a rate cut. The result? A tangle of confusing signals.

ENCOURAGEMENT FOR BLACK FILMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (af) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DANA POINT, Calif. _ Cornel West is well known as an expert on
social issues and as a professor of the philosophy of religion and
of African-American studies at Harvard University. But for a few
hours on Sunday evening, West became confessor, revivalist preacher
and coach to black filmmakers and entertainment executives at a
gathering here at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   What was most striking about his appearance was the difficulty
he faced in offering hope to those frustrated by the Hollywood
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering at this resort south of Los Angeles was the second
annual ``summit'' of the Black Filmmakers Foundation, an
organization formed to help independent black filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of the meeting was to create a forum for networking and
deal-making for members of ethnic minorities; Latinos, American
Indians and Asian-Americans were also invited.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said they wanted to create an atmosphere like that of
an annual media and entertainment conference run by Allen &AMP; Co. in
Sun Valley, Idaho, which attracts people like the investor Warren
Buffet; Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft, and Michael Eisner,
chairman of the Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely 100 people were invited to attend the meeting, which
was underwritten by HBO. Among them were the directors Carl
Franklin, Robert Townsend and Kassi Lemmons; the actors and
producers Vondie Curtis Hall and Mario Van Peebles, and Robert
Johnson, founder and chairman of the Black Entertainment Television
cable channel.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the seminars and panels focused on specific subjects
like financing and marketing movies, and opportunities in
children's programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole point of this is to figure out strategies we can use
to be successful in this business,'' said Warrington Hudlin, the
foundation's president, and a producer of ``Boomerang'' and ``House
Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Hudlin and many others attending the meeting have found
some success in Hollywood, the air was frequently filled with
disappointment, particularly over the fact that while black music
like hip-hop attracts a broad audience in the United States and
abroad, black movies generally do not.
</P>
<P>
   Several people noted that ``Beloved,'' the movie based on Toni
Morrison's novel of how a black woman deals with the legacy of
slavery, had not done well with either white or black audiences.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is the latest in a string of films on black themes
have not broken out, including ``Why Do Fools Fall in Love,''
``Rosewood'' and ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back.'' Filmmakers
here expressed concern that the studios would be less willing to
finance such projects in the future.
</P>
<P>
   One person after another complained of inadequate marketing of
black movies by the major studios, a reluctance to market them
overseas and even of attracting black audiences to black movies,
particularly young blacks.
</P>
<P>
   West sought to transform the worries and complaints into plans
for practical action, and offered encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally believe that, in terms of entertainment, if there
was a really fair playing field, the entertainment industry would
look like the NBA,'' he said, adding: ``I think we're at an
historic turning point. There are tremendous expectations of all of
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Cundieff, a comic and a director, said young black
audiences shied away from entertainment that lacked a hard edge or
that appeared to be uplifting rather than gritty. He noted that
many of the young avoided seeing rap stars who have become role
models take on dramatic parts in which they were perceived to be
``going soft.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking such roles, he added, can rob the stars of their
legitimacy in the eyes of their audience. And if rap performers are
discouraged from taking those roles, one result is less diversity
of black entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   But the business of the meeting was business, and West sought to
refocus the discussion by noting that, though the white business
community is frequently divided, chief executives of major
companies tend to put differences aside and close ranks when their
economic interests are threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to close ranks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And the talk was all business when the panel discussions began.
Appearing on a panel, Johnson of Black Entertainment Television
made clear that capitalism, not altruism, led him to focus on
winning over black audiences. Asked by one participant whether
there was room for two black cable channels, Johnson said flatly,
``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also said that finding a white partner in the
entertainment industry was a necessity for most ventures; his own
company is partly owned by, and has received help from, John
Malone's Liberty Media. He added that complaining about hurdles was
not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wake up black in America, and that alone is a challenge,''
he said. ``But what are you going to do, go back to bed? For an
entrepreneur, those challenges are part of the standard operating
procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said that if blacks want to make films that are true to
their experience, they have to control the financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one will let you tell your story on film unless you own the
company,'' said Johnson, who has started a venture to produce four
to five movies a year at a cost of no more than $3 million each.
``You have to control the financial end.''
</P>
<P>
   Some participants said that creating movies that have crossover
appeal to a white audience should not be a concern, that black
producers should focus on winning black audiences because they are
potentially so large and because white-run film companies were
competing for their attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have something we can control, or should _ our own
markets,'' said Byron Lewis, founder of UniWorld Group Inc., an
advertising agency. ``Don't worry about crossover. If you dilute
your thing, you'll be doing yourselves a disservice.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that blacks would have to work hard to maintain a grip
on black audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Urban doesn't mean urban,'' Lewis said. ``It means black. It
is a word white people use so they can play in that area.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Johnson responded, ``They'll be using our best talent
and using it as an entree to our market, unless we can.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An Adman's Dream
</P>
<P>
   What person in, say, the advertising business hasn't kicked back
his feet at some point, stared out the window and thought about
bailing out of the rat race, traveling and maybe even writing a
movie script. And then getting some of Hollywood's top talents to
produce and act in the film and a former poet laureate to direct
it.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the dream of Myron Goble, advertising strategic
planner one day, well-traveled author of a script directed by Maya
Angelou, if not the next day, not too much later.
</P>
<P>
   Goble is the author of ``Down in the Delta,'' scheduled to open
on Christmas Day. The film is both a drama and an allegory about a
black family's path to redemption and dignity after undergoing the
brutal indignities of slavery and the diaspora from the rural South
to the industrial North.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beloved'' tackles the difficult subject of slavery with a mix
of brutal realism and dreamlike sequences. ``Down in the Delta,''
made for $3.5 million, approaches the issue largely through
metaphor.
</P>
<P>
   By his own account, Goble, 43, was an advertising man in
Manhattan when dissatisfaction with his career led him to take a
sabbatical in 1990 and, as he put it, just think about things and
clear his head. His six-month leave turned into a year as he
backpacked around South America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no real agenda,'' Goble said. ``Well, the only agenda
was living on 50 cents a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in New York in 1991, two fortuitous events gave him some
focus. He read ``The Promised Land,'' Nicholas Lemann's book on the
movement of blacks from the South to industrial centers in the
North, and he went to a bad movie. Goble said he walked out of the
movie feeling he could do better and, untainted by any advice on
how to do it, sat down to write a script.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by the book, he tackled the story of a black family in
inner-city Chicago that reclaims its roots in the Mississippi delta
in the era of slavery. The reconnection to the past is made through
a silver candelabra the family has passed down for generations and
dubbed Nathan. Understanding Nathan delivers the family from the
ghetto and destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Alfre Woodward plays the mother, who flirts with alcohol and
drugs; Mary Alice plays her earnest and sad mother; Mpho Koaho is
her struggling son, and Al Freeman Jr. plays an uncle back in
Mississippi who clings to the family history. Ms. Angelou, well
known for her poetry and autobiographical writings, directs her
first feature film.
</P>
<P>
   As pleased as he was with the finished product, Goble said, the
effort involved a difficult introduction to the ways of Hollywood
and required great reserves of patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just said: `Burn all your bridges and close all the exits.
If you don't get this movie made, you die,' '' Goble recalled,
adding that once ``Down in the Delta'' is released, he will begin
trying to sell his second script, about several generations of a
Southern family.

 &HT;    JUDGE ADMONISHES MICROSOFT DEFENDERS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After presiding for three weeks over the Microsoft
antitrust trial, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson voiced
his mounting frustration Thursday over both the thrust and pace of
the software company's courtroom tactics.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in the trial, Jackson sustained a government
objection when a Microsoft lawyer's sought to cross-examine an
Apple Computer Inc. executive on an 11-page technical document that
been downloaded from a Netscape Communications Corp. Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things are credible on the Web that are not
necessarily admissible (in court),'' Jackson told Microsoft lawyer
Theodore Edelman.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief recess, Apple Senior Vice President Avadis
Tevanian Jr. said he couldn't begin to comprehend the new defense
exhibit. When Edelman nevertheless persisted in seeking to question
Tevanian about the Netscape paper, Jackson's wrath showed beneath
his black robes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you better go on to another subject,'' he told
Edelman.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also rebuked Edelman after the attorney had asked
Tevanian about internal Apple e-mails that assessed Microsoft's
offer to collaborate on multimedia technology for personal
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Tevanian testified Microsoft had employed what he termed
``threats'' to pressure Apple to scrap its QuickTime multimedia
software for Windows so that it could more easily market its own
budding NetShow product.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are talking about pros and cons,'' Tevanian said,
referring to the engineers who were weighing Microsoft's 1997 offer
_ an offer, Tevanian added, that ``didn't make sense to us.''
</P>
<P>
   When Edelman had several times called the internal e-mail
exchanges ``Apple proposals to Microsoft,'' Jackson jumped in.
``You keep mischaracterizing what he told you,'' the judge
interjected, displaying rising impatience with Edelman's sarcastic
courtroom manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The witness just said this was not a proposal,'' Jackson
added. ``This was a predecisional communication by two Apple
engineers discussing a proposal which was explicitly rejected by
Mr. Tevanian and others. It's misleading language and it is not
acceptable to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also stepped in to directly question Tevanian about
whether Sherlock, a program to help users find information on their
computer or on the Internet, was ``built in'' to Apple's operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   The government bases its antitrust suit against Microsoft partly
on charges it linked products such as its Internet Explorer Web
browser to its Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Tevanian replied that the product was not ``built in,'' but
``bundled'' with the operating system, a defense Microsoft has
employed in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Tevanian, the government's third witness, will return on Monday
for a quick round of friendly questions from Justice Department
attorney Phillip Malone.
</P>
<P>
   In two full days on the witness stand, Tevanian stoutly
maintained that the software giant had threatened to scuttle an
upgrade of its popular Office for Mac software to force Apple to
give Internet Explorer a favored position on Macintosh computers.
</P>
<P>
   Edelman sought to repair some of the damage from this testimony
by showing a statement videotaped before the trial by Steven
Decker, the procurement officer for Compaq Computer's Presario
line.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Compaq had refused to bundle Apple's QuickTime 3.0
multimedia software in Presario models under pressure from
Microsoft, Decker replied: ``That's actually false. We'd be
shipping QuickTime today if Apple were giving it to us for free.''
</P>
<P>
   In his direct testimony, Tevanian had quoted fellow Apple
executive Phil Schiller has having been told by Decker: ``You have
to understand what's going on here. (Compaq is) very afraid of
doing anything to upset Microsoft. We are very wary of bundling
anything that would upset Microsoft because they touch us in so
many places.''

COMMENTARY: WHERE THE PORK IS TAX-FREE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By RUSSELL BAKER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The big election issue in Burgville was the meals tax. Would the
people approve a tax on restaurant meals to help pay for building
schools? Burgville's cry of ``No!'' was resounding.
</P>
<P>
   I knew it would be, so I voted for it. Voting to be taxed so
Burgville youth could get an education and amount to something made
me feel not only like a good citizen, but also like a wonderful
human being.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing the tax hadn't a chance of passage doubled the
satisfaction with which I cast the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Burgville elections are always rife with certainties. Everybody
always knows for certain that congressman Frank Buckner will be
re-elected, as he was on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He's Republican. Nothing but Republicans have been elected in
Burgville, or within a radius of 200 miles, since the Weather
Bureau began keeping records.
</P>
<P>
   I figured Buckner a good bet to get 75 percent of the vote, and,
being a student of history, I know that when a politician gets 75
percent of the vote it often goes to his head and, sooner or later,
he starts behaving like Lyndon Johnson or Caligula.
</P>
<P>
   So, though Buckner has actually been perfectly acceptable, as
Congressmen go, I voted against him as a matter of abstract
principle. Some show of opposition was important, I thought,
possibly to save Burgville from the caprices of tyranny.
</P>
<P>
   I remember reading that Caligula made his horse a consul of
Rome. Or was it associate emperor? It's not important what the
office was. It's the horse of the matter that interests me.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Burgville is surrounded by horses and all the
paraphernalia that goes with them: hounds, foxes, saddles, bourbon,
chukkas of polo, people so devoted to their horses that they hitch
horse carriers to their pickups and take them out for Sunday drives
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Is it inconceivable that in this venue a tyrant hardened by
incessantly winning 75 percent of the vote might make his horse
mayor of Burgville?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I guess it is if we are talking of sedate Frank Buckner in
his neatly pressed, but not ostentatiously custom-tailored,
middle-of-the road-Republican, not right-wing-nut, suits.
</P>
<P>
   Still, all this Burgville certainty _ there's something
unhealthy about it. So I voted for the Democrat, even though his
campaign literature disclosed an alarming amount of time spent in
divinity schools.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are bad enough about confusing Gospel and politics.
Why encourage the habit in Democrats? If he had had a chance of
winning, I might have reconsidered the wisdom of voting against
Buckner, and never mind the threat of tyranny.
</P>
<P>
   Since, however, nobody could recall a Democrat ever winning
anything in Burgville, I felt safe in acting on my intellectual
grasp of history, and voted Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the comfort of political life in Burgville. Here a
person can always vote the way a good citizen ought to vote and be
certain that the majority of the electorate will never let him
suffer the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Televised experts in faraway cities droned on far past 10:30,
when Jock's Exxon down the block closes for the night. I nodded by
the tube as the silence of downtown Burgville's empty streets
deepened outside and televised experts filled the house with expert
talk about significance.
</P>
<P>
   Several experts, not the least grateful to have the 1998 ordeal
behind them, launched into the politics of the year 2000. Several
were certain who the Republican candidates would be.
</P>
<P>
   No expert suggested the arresting possibility that their year
2000 nominees might forgo a crack at the White House rather than
have their sex lives fully investigated, an ordeal that all
Presidential candidates will have to face for a while to come.
</P>
<P>
   I thought certain that Burgville's unbeatable Frank Buckner
would have nothing to fear on the scandal front, but none of the
experts seemed to think he was Presidential timber.
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott began appearing on various channels
looking stunned and pretending to calmness about their unhappy day.
In Burgville, all had been certainty for hours, for days, for
years. There would be no new tax on dinner at Johnson's Charcoal
Beef House.
</P>
<P>
   At midnight I pushed the button that closed the turbulent story
of democracy with its poisonous commercials and slimy millions.
Squalor, squalor everywhere. But in Burgville, certainty.

HYDE SAYS GINGRICH DESERVES BLAME FOR GOP LOSSES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republican who will head the impeachment
inquiry against President Clinton said Thursday that House Speaker
Newt Gingrich deserves the blame for this year's election losses.
</P>
<P>
   In unusual public comments critical of Gingrich, House Judiciary
Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said that Republicans lacked
a ``unifying theme'' this year and instead ran a ``stall-the-ball
campaign'' that wound up costing the party five seats in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did conduct a status-quo, don't rock the boat,
stall-the-ball campaign, and it cost us,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leadership takes the credit when things go right. They ought
to take the blame when things go wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said he thought Gingrich would probably survive a challenge
to his leadership position, which some moderate and conservative
members are contemplating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rather think he will, but that remains to be seen,'' Hyde
said.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked if he plans to support Gingrich in his bid for
re-election as speaker of the next Congress, Hyde sidestepped the
question with a smile, muttering only a ``good morning'' as he left
the room.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde was just one of a number of influential Republicans who
were talking among themselves Thursday about the possibility of a
shake-up in the House Republican leadership team. Some moderate and
conservative members were urging Gingrich to resign while
encouraging House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Livingston
of Louisiana to run in his place.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Livingston, in a telephone conversation with
Gingrich, had suggested that he step aside.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans also were calling for the two Texans in the
leadership _ Majority Leader Dick Armey of Irving and Majority Whip
Tom DeLay of Sugar Land _ to resign as well.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers interviewed over the past two days said
Armey may be challenged. But they were less certain about DeLay,
who is generally viewed by both Republicans and Democrats as one of
the better whips to serve in the post in recent times. They also
said GOP conference Chairman John Boehner of Ohio was likely to be
replaced. Rep. John Linder of Georgia, who headed the House
Republicans' campaign committee, will also be replaced, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be some changes in the Republican
leadership,'' said Rep. Joe Scarborough of Florida. But he added
that he wasn't certain whether there would be a complete shake-up
involving a new cast of characters or whether just one or possibly
two members of the leadership team would be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Tom's in trouble because he was the lead guy after
Clinton,'' said another Republican. ``The general view is he led
the charge (to impeach the president) that wound up getting
rebuffed. But I think in the end he'll have enough votes to beat
any effort to dislodge him.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay communications director Mike Scanlon said Thursday the
congressman wasn't ready to comment on the election results or the
calls for a new leadership team.

   Ironically, DeLay was involved last year in the failed attempt
by GOP conservatives to remove Gingrich. Since then, however, the
Texan has been a loyal Gingrich lieutenant. In fact it was DeLay
who last spring reached out on behalf of Gingrich to the religious
right, arranging a meeting with Christian broadcaster James Dobson
and other Christian GOP leaders in hopes of enlisting their support
in the election.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of that meeting, Gingrich allowed votes to be held
on a number of issues important to religious and social
conservatives, including anti-abortion amendments, a school prayer
initiative and ending federal funding of the arts.
</P>
<P>
   The votes, which failed for the most part, upset a number of GOP
moderates who criticized the leadership for wasting valuable
legislative time on battles that had already been fought and lost
in previous sessions of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans will meet in two weeks to hold their leadership
elections. In addition to Livingston, Rep. David McIntosh of
Indiana and Steve Largent of Oklahoma are trying to generate
support for challenges to Gingrich and Armey.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, said he was contacted by McIntosh,
but still plans to support Gingrich ``unless he doesn't get the
message'' that the party ``needs to set a legislative agenda and
stick to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some members have mentioned House Ways and Mean Chairman Bill
Archer, R-Texas, as a possible Gingrich replacement. But he is said
not be interested in tackling the job and generally viewed as a
long shot anyway because he may not have enough broad support
within the conference. &QL;

PALESTINIAN LEADER ABU ABRA DENIES INVOLVEMENT IN SLAYING OF 2
ISRAELI HIKERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHLEHEM _ One day soon, Khader Abu Abra expects the
Palestinian police to arrest him for murder.
</P>
<P>
   A leader of a small Palestinian organization opposed to the
peace accords signed with Israel, Khader Abu Abra is accused of
ordering the killing of two young Israeli hikers three years ago,
an allegation he denies.
</P>
<P>
   He says he was in Jericho at the time Uri Shachor and Oded
Bachrach were shot dead in Wadi Kelt, a valley of desert trails
outside the West Bank town of Jericho.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis disagree. They've put Abu Abra's name on a list of
30 wanted Palestinians whose arrest they are demanding before they
agree to do their part of the new land-for-security deal signed at
the Wye River conference center last month.
</P>
<P>
   It's a quid pro quo that evokes looks of astonishment from Abu
Abra, unusual among wanted Palestinians for his candid television
appearances here, in which he professes his innocence. Most other
wanted Palestinians, accused of such acts as carrying out drive-by
shootings and facilitating suicide bombings, are in hiding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a victim of the Wye agreement,'' said Abu Abra, a
40-year-old father of three neatly dressed in a suit, tie and white
golfing cap in a sparse office in Bethlehem. ``I had nothing to do
with these murders.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Israel announced that the Palestinians had agreed
to a timetable for the arrest of the wanted men, the last hurdle
the Palestinians had to jump before Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu agreed to convene his Cabinet to ratify the Wye accord.
</P>
<P>
   Each time Israel transfers West Bank land to the Palestinians _
which is supposed to happen three times over the next three months
_ the Palestinians will arrest one-third of the wanted men, Israel
said.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the Israeli Cabinet met Thursday morning, four days
late according to a schedule outlined in the Wye agreement. They
debated for 13 hours and agreed to resume discussions Friday.
Netanyahu said he was confident the 17 ministers would ratify the
accord, by Sunday at the latest. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``We received the necessary assurances from the United States
that the (Palestinian Authority) would arrest all 30,'' Netanyahu
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was also promised to us that there would be no revolving
(prison) door,'' Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Israel had complained that often Palestinians
convicted of attacks against Israel later would be let out of
Palestinian prisons or that militants often were arrested and
released repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   The Cabinet also discussed for the first time a map outlining
which parts of the West Bank _ 13 percent in all _ that would be
turned over to Palestinian control. A special committee made up of
ministers, experts and settlers will review the map and make
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   By insisting on a timetable for the capture of wanted men,
analysts say Netanyahu has blunted criticism that the Wye accord
didn't include a demand emotional to many Israelis: extradition.
Israeli refer to extradition as ``transfer'' to avoid using terms
that seem to confer statehood on the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   The original Oslo peace accord called on the Palestinians to
hand suspects over to Israel unless they were being held in a
Palestinian prison. The new agreement doesn't mention this.
Instead, it says the Palestinians must arrest, interrogate and try
anyone involved in terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
   But arresting all the wanted men may not be so easy for the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Many ordinary Palestinians question the veracity of lists that
in the past have included dead Hamas bombmaker Mohieddin Sharif
long after his death and still fail to list Mohammed Deif, today
the number one wanted bombmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, earlier lists had put Ghazi Jabali, the Palestinian
police chief in Gaza, at the top. Israel accused him of ordering
attacks on settlers in the West Bank, a charge the Palestinians
deny. His name was deleted as an Israeli concession during the Wye
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   As long as things go smoothly, Palestinians stand to benefit on
several fronts that could boost their economy and unite families
separated for years by political obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   Besides turning over 13 percent of West Bank territory, Israel
has agreed to release 750 prisoners, to open an airport in Gaza and
to allow Palestinians to travel between the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian President Yasser Arafat seems determined to make
sure that nothing stands in the way of these gains.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, he said in Arabic that the wanted men had
committed ``terrorist acts''_ unusually harsh language,
particularly for a Palestinian audience. Arafat added that his
security forces had arrested 12 of those on the list and would make
a ``100 percent'' effort to arrest the others.
</P>
<P>
   In Bethlehem, Abu Abra lives the life of a wanted man. He's not
hiding, but he never leaves Palestinian-ruled Bethlehem. His
children sleep at the homes of relatives each night while he waits
for a midnight knock on the door.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes that if he is arrested, he'll be able to prove his
innocence.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, when the Israeli hikers were killed, he said he was in
Palestinian-ruled Jericho, where he had gone to escape arrest by
Israel on charges of belonging to an illegal organization, the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   While he was in Jericho, Israel arrested a Palestinian who
confessed during interrogation to committing the Wadi Kelt murders
and named Abu Abbara as the mastermind behind the operation.
</P>
<P>
   That Palestinian later was released after proving that he had
been at work in a Jewish settlement at the time of the murders, Abu
Abra said. Two other Palestinians were tried and convicted of the
crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``These accusations are based on false confessions,'' said Abu
Abra. ``I'm an easy target because I'm a political leader of the
Popular Front.

<P>
   B-
</P>
<P>
   In this sequel to ``Air Bud,'' Buddy, the hoop-shooting golden
retriever, and his boy, Josh (Kevin Zegers), trade basketball for
football. Scriptwise, it's little more than a glorified
``Afterschool Special,'' but it handles its messages well. And in
his K-9 jersey, pads and helmet, Buddy looks more athletically
heroic than Bruce Willis.
</P>

<P>
   With the voices of Woody Allen, Sharon Stone, Sylvester
Stallone.
</P>
<P>
   PG

</P>
<P>
   A visual picnic, a so-so script. This computer-animated feature
tells of worker ant Z (voice of Woody Allen), whose love of
Princess Bala (Sharon Stone) lands both of them in the scary world
outside the ant colony. It's fun, but the story is as predictable
as the spectacular visuals are not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apt Pupil''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ian McKellen, Brad Renfro.
</P>
<P>
   R (violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   B
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from a Stephen King novella, Bryan Singer's flawed but
chilling lesson in the infectious nature of evil stars Brad Renfro
as a teenager obsessed with the Holocaust who discovers an infamous
Nazi war criminal (Ian McKellen) living in his neighborhood. In
exchange for not turning him in, the boy makes him recount in
detail the atrocities he committed.

<P>
   The world interpreted as a video game. While ``Deep Impact''
treated a similar let's-save-Earth story with sobriety,
``Armageddon,'' showing at area discount theaters, never lets the
threat of global annihilation get in the way of fun. It's a
space-cowboy movie, with Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck saving the
world for Liv Tyler.

   Starring DMX, Nas, Tionne Watkins.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   C+
</P>
<P>
   This film debut by Hype Williams, who has produced music videos,
will be welcomed by hip-hop heads and fans of rappers DMX and Nas.
Although the images are dazzling and an opening heist scene is
promising, the story falls flat. Tommy (DMX) is a thug chasing
power, money and respect, but Sincere (Nas) wants to quit the crime
game for a more stable life.

Elise.
</P>
<P>
   R (violent images, sexuality, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   B-
</P>
<P>
   An A-list epic that inadvertently proves that Toni Morrison's
novels are unfilmable. Oprah Winfrey plays Sethe, a former slave
haunted by the ghost of her dead daughter, who takes in the
mysterious stranger Beloved (Thandie Newton). Too faithful to
Morrison's magic-realist prose, the movie substitutes mood for
emotional power and narrative clarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Chill''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Kline, Glenn Close, William Hurt.

<P>

   A
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years after its original release, Lawrence Kasdan's film
about some college pals from the '60s, reunited for a long weekend
by the suicide of one of their group, is more than a requiem for
that era. The picture is about friendship, change, coping, lost
ideals, found strengths and, perhaps most of all, about the many
ways we give life to those we care about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blade''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Wesley Snipes, Kris Kristofferson.
</P>
<P>
   R (profanity and extreme violence)
</P>
<P>
   C-
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't cut it. Wesley Snipes stars as the half-vampire,
half-human hero who can handle sunlight but also has a taste for
blood. Armed with an arsenal of sci-fi gadgets, Blade is devoted to
wiping out all vampires. Especially a strutting bloodsucker played
by Stephen Dorff. Alas, all the nonstop slash 'n' gnash action
becomes more repetitive than anything else.

   Chucky is back, thanks to his doll of a girlfriend, who recites
incantations from her book, ``Voodoo for Dummies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Dolittle''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Eddie Murphy. Voices by Chris Rock and Norm MacDonald.
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 (profanity, crude humor)
</P>
<P>
   B-
</P>
<P>
   This raucous but uninspired Eddie Murphy vehicle has almost
nothing to do with the old Rex Harrison musical. Murphy is John
Dolittle, a busy doctor who has neglected his wife (Kristen Wilson)
and his two daughters. One day, all kinds of animals start
pestering him vocally. Despite the zing of some nuttier moments,
the lame plot keeps dragging the movie to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever After''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Drew Barrymore, Dougray Scott, Anjelica Huston.
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 (violence and emotional situations)
</P>
<P>
   B+
</P>
<P>
   Happily, this ``Ever After'' proves you can teach an old doll
new tricks. Reinventing the Cinderella story in a way that targets
``Titanic''-loving teens, the movie stars Drew Barrymore as the
spirited heroine, Anjelica Huston as her scheming stepmother and
Dougray Scott as a prince who's more than just another trophy
husband.

   ``Happiness'' may be the most ironic movie title of the '90s.
This controversial film is a bleak, unsparing and yet relentlessly

``sad comedy'' to ``black comedy,'' but ``Happiness'' is about as
dark as they come.

Alice Hoffman novel, the two deal with backfired spells and that
most unpredictable magic, love. Co-starring Aidan Quinn, Dianne
Wiest and Stockard Channing, it's lightweight but works like a
charm.

   Ronin are shamed samurai who, having lost their master, are for
hire. Robert De Niro and Jean Reno lead some modern-day ``ronin'' _
Cold Warriors without a war _ hired to snatch a mysterious
suitcase. John Frankenheimer (``The Manchurian Candidate'') and an

   Kung fu king Jackie Chan and fast-talking comedian Chris Tucker
play two cops whose clashes go way beyond cultural differences.
Thrown together by FBI agents who don't want either mucking up
their search for a kidnapped child, the pair learn to work

   Part gung-ho heroism, part in-your-face horror show, Steven
Spielberg's superb film shows us World War II as we've never seen
it before. Tom Hanks leads a courageous squad on a mission to find
a private (Matt Damon) whose three brothers have already been
killed in combat. Hanks' performance is a miracle of decency and
subtle emotion, but kudos all around here.

<P>
   This modest, refreshingly decent film is set in the Tidewater
area of Virginia during the Depression. A 99-year-old former slave
(John Franklin Sawyer) arrives at the downtrodden home of the
Dabney clan, a formerly prosperous tobacco family. His one request:
to be buried on ``Dabney land.'' However, it's not as simple as it
sounds.

<P>
   Which would be worse: a series of terrorist bombings of New
York, or the martial-law takeover by the Army as a response? Denzel
Washington, Annette Bening and Bruce Willis star in a fast-moving,
well-made paranoid thriller that ultimately reduces a hot-button
topic to a standard Hollywood action cliche.

   Starring Ian Michael Smith, Joseph Mazzello.
</P>
<P>
   PG (sexual innuendo and violence)

<P>
   D+
</P>
<P>
   A little movie with big problems. In the early '60s, a
pre-adolescent dwarf named Simon Birch (Ian Michael Smith) is
convinced he will one day be a hero while his best pal
</P>
<P>
   (Joseph Mazzello) tries to solve the mystery of his real father.
Ashley Judd is Mazzello's close-mouthed mom. The movie is clearly a
labor of love; alas, it's also a labor to sit through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small Soldiers''

   Starring Gregory Smith, Kirsten Dunst
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 (violence and profanity)

<P>
   B-

<P>
   This action- and violence-packed movie is heavy on
computer-generated effects but woefully light on plot twists or
interesting characters (either flesh-and-blood or plastic).
Borrowing liberally from too many other movies, action figures come
alive, start warring with each other (and any human who gets in
their way) and destroy an idyllic small-town neighborhood.

   Rude, crude and hilarious. Ben Stiller plays Ted, a nerdy high

attending his prom with the class golden girl (Cameron Diaz).
Thirteen years later, the still-obsessed Ted hires a gumshoe (Matt
Dillon) to track her down.

   C+
</P>
<P>
   Alicia Witt and Jared Leto star in the latest knockoff of
``Scream'' and ``I Know What You Did Last Summer.'' The
college-campus, teen-kill thriller is slickly made, well-played,
instantly forgettable.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   R (sex, profanity, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   B-
</P>
<P>
   There is more style than substance in this re-creation of the
glam-rock scene in '70s London. Jonathan Rhys Meyers has the
central role of a rock star whose abrupt disappearance becomes the
object of a search conducted by a former-fan-turned-journalist. The
second half is hopelessly scattered, but the soundtrack is
terrific, as is Ewan McGregor as a Dionysian rocker.

   Starring Adam Sandler, Kathy Bates.
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 (comic violence, profanity)
</P>
<P>
   B
</P>
<P>
   A watered-down comedy. After a successful stab at romantic
comedy in ``The Wedding Singer,'' Adam Sandler returns to his
lowbrow roots with this story about a bayou bumpkin who becomes a
college football star. It's dumb and predictable, which would be OK
if there were more laughs. But Kathy Bates is hilarious as
Sandler's domineering mama.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Dreams May Come''
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robin Williams, Annabella Sciorra, Cuba Gooding Jr.
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 (emotional and

</P>
<P>
   B+
</P>
<P>
   In this tear-jerker, Robin Williams stars as a doctor exploring
aspects of the afterlife after he's killed in a car crash.
Annabella Sciorra is his widow; Cuba Gooding Jr., his spiritual
guide. The movie is emotionally and visually stunning, a little
simplistic story-wise.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   R (profanity, sex, drug use)

</P>
<P>
   This dark, dramatic biopic stars Halle Berry, Vivica A. Fox and
Lela Rochon as the women who were married to doo-wopper Frankie
Lymon, and whose court fight over his royalty ``estate'' clues us
to the singer's sorry life. Boasting some great late '50s and early
'60s rock sounds, this film, unfortunately, spins back and forth
narratively.

   It's the 60th anniversary of this all-time favorite. Based on L.

who, with her dog Toto, is blown out of Kansas by a twister and
into the Land of Oz. On the yellow brick road they meet up with the
Cowardly Lion, the Tin Man and the Scarecrow as they sing and dance
their way toward the Emerald City.

AMID VIOLENCE, COLOMBIA, REBELS PREPARE FOR PEACE TALKS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN OTIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ Against the backdrop of ferocious guerrilla
attacks, sabotage and kidnappings _ indeed, seemingly against all
odds _ the Colombian government and leftist rebels still are
preparing to talk peace.
</P>
<P>
   Such contact would be the first extensive dialogue between the
two sides in five years.
</P>
<P>
   In a clear acknowledgment of the insurgents' bargaining power,
President Andres Pastrana agreed to withdraw all police and army
troops from five municipalities covering 15,000 square miles in
southern Colombia. This demilitarized zone will be established
Saturday and last 90 days to provide a neutral setting for the
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as the clamor to end the 34-year war grows in Colombia,
Pastrana's strategy continues to be questioned widely.
</P>
<P>
   As the government offers concessions in the name of peace, the
guerrillas have answered with bullets and bombs.
</P>
<P>
   The DMZ, for example, will allow the 15,000-strong Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, to assume de facto control over
a swath of territory the size of Switzerland just days after their
latest military rampage.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, about 1,400 FARC guerrillas overran a police base in
the jungle town of Mitu near the Brazilian border. During a
three-day onslaught, the rebels leveled the police garrison, seized
the airstrip and blew up the communications tower. Nearly all the
base's 120 police agents were killed or kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   By the time government forces regained control Wednesday, 150
soldiers and seven civilians had died. The guerrillas said five
rebels were killed and 15 wounded. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``This is not a good way to sit down and negotiate,'' said an
editorial in the Bogota daily El Tiempo. ``If one is looking for
peace, the normal and prudent thing to do is to act peacefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Pastrana is moving forward. Even before all the
bodies were buried in Mitu, Pastrana insisted: ``The peace process
is not threatened. To have peace, you must have patience.''
</P>
<P>
   Stopping the carnage was the No. 1 theme of his election
campaign. Just weeks before he was sworn in on Aug. 7, Pastrana met
with Manuel ``Sureshot'' Marulanda, the FARC's legendary commander.
The clandestine reunion paved the way for the upcoming talks.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Pastrana also is urging Colombia's second
largest rebel group, the National Liberation Army, or ELN, to
negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the ELN and more than 200 politicians, civilian
activists and church leaders are scheduled to hold a so-called
``National Convention'' to discuss the nation's troubles and a
possible peace pact.
</P>
<P>
   But even this apparent breakthrough was followed by bloodshed.
Last month ELN commandos dynamited an oil pipeline in northern
Colombia. A river of oil spilled into the nearby village of Machuca
where it caught fire and burned at least 65 people to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Machuca incident, (the convention) is up in the
air,'' said Francisco Santos, a top editor at El Tiempo, and a
peace activist who was helping organize the convention. ``What the
hell is this? Are we being used as idiots?``
</P>
<P>
   Still, many analysts had predicted that rebel attacks and
sabotage would increase as the date for peace talks nears. Both
guerrilla groups want to come to the table in the strongest
possible position.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on Mitu netted the guerrillas another 40 to 45
captives at a time when the FARC is attempting to win the release
of 452 jailed guerrillas through a prisoner exchange. FARC
bargaining chips already included 300 police and army troops taken
hostage in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   The pending talks, which FARC leaders describe as a
``preliminary dialogue'' rather than binding negotiations, likely
will take place in San Vicente del Caguan in the DMZ 170 miles
southwest of Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   The FARC has been adamant that the discussions will not deal
with the possibility of disarming.
</P>
<P>
   Although the guerrillas probably lack the power to overthrow the
government, they regularly deal punishing blows to the demoralized
and poorly trained Colombian army.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas aren't even bothering to send any of their high
command to the talks. The FARC will be represented by three
low-ranking military leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``That raises doubts about whether the FARC is really serious,''
said Javier Torres, a private security consultant in Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Santos points out that the Colombian
establishment has yet to consider FARC demands for agricultural
reform, increased social spending and a more equitable distribution
of the nation's riches.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's one thing that the peace process has going for it
is that it is going to force us to talk about Colombia's real
problems,'' Santos said.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana is gambling that the DMZ will help build a measure of
trust and lead to real progress.
</P>
<P>
   The FARC and ELN refused to deal with the previous government of
President Ernesto Samper, in part, because he was elected with the
help of millions of dollars of drug money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to knock the military pullout as a sell-out, but
it's an initiative and the most serious one in years,'' said a
western diplomat. ``If that's what it takes to get people to the
table, it seems like a relatively small price to pay.``
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, some politicians fear that the price of the DMZ
will be an increase in coca cultivation and drug trafficking. The
FARC finances its war partly by taxing drug smugglers and coca
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   But during Pastrana's state visit to Washington last month,
President Clinton vowed to support his peace initiatives and
offered $280 million over several years in economic aid.
</P>
<P>
   And in reality, the military drawdown may turn out to be less
dramatic than it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   The zone is a traditional FARC stronghold. The guerrillas
exercise vast control of the countryside while federal authorities
stick to the urban centers. Even the Army rarely ventures outside
its sandbagged bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The territory has always been abandoned'' by the state, said
Javier Munera, director of CEUDES, a Bogota research center. ``Not
much will change and people know that.``
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, FARC leader Marulanda has accused the government of
trying to sabotage the peace process by creating special commando
units that he claims will try to assassinate him or Pastrana. Armed
Forces Commander Gen. Fernando Tapias strongly denied the
accusation.
</P>
<P>
   The Pastrana administration is considering granting a blanket
amnesty for imprisoned guerrillas convicted of a wide range of
crimes, including kidnapping and terrorism. By contrast, El
Salvador, Guatemala and other nations that recently ended civil
wars, dealt with that issue only when peace was nearly at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana also has had to address concerns that the guerrillas
are trying to carve Colombia into a series of nation-states. Many
analysts believe the FARC's long-term aim is to gain direct control
over several of Colombia's 32 states, and that the rebels will use
the DMZ as a trial run at local government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not accept peace at any price or agree to any de facto
division or balkanization of the country,'' Pastrana insisted in a
speech to the National Press Club in Washington. ``I did not become
president of Colombia in order to preside over its dissolution.''

   In this sequel to ``Air Bud,'' Buddy, the hoop-shooting golden

power, money and respect, but Sincere (Nas) wants to quit the crime
game for a more stable life.

   R (violent images, sexuality, nudity)

   B-
</P>
<P>
   An A-list epic that inadvertently proves that Toni Morrison's
novels are unfilmable. Oprah Winfrey plays Sethe, a former slave
haunted by the ghost of her dead daughter, who takes in the
mysterious stranger Beloved (Thandie Newton). Too faithful to
Morrison's magic-realist prose, the movie substitutes mood for
emotional power and narrative clarity.

   Fifteen years after its original release, Lawrence Kasdan's film
about some college pals from the '60s, reunited for a long weekend
by the suicide of one of their group, is more than a requiem for
that era. The picture is about friendship, change, coping, lost
ideals, found strengths and, perhaps most of all, about the many
ways we give life to those we care about.

   ``Blade''

   Starring Wesley Snipes, Kris Kristofferson.
</P>
<P>
   R (profanity and extreme violence)
</P>
<P>
   C-
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't cut it. Wesley Snipes stars as the half-vampire,
half-human hero who can handle sunlight but also has a taste for
blood. Armed with an arsenal of sci-fi gadgets, Blade is devoted to
wiping out all vampires. Especially a strutting bloodsucker played
by Stephen Dorff. Alas, all the nonstop slash 'n' gnash action
becomes more repetitive than anything else.

</P>
<P>
   B-
</P>
<P>
   This raucous but uninspired Eddie Murphy vehicle has almost
nothing to do with the old Rex Harrison musical. Murphy is John
Dolittle, a busy doctor who has neglected his wife (Kristen Wilson)
and his two daughters. One day, all kinds of animals start
pestering him vocally. Despite the zing of some nuttier moments,
the lame plot keeps dragging the movie to the ground.

   Happily, this ``Ever After'' proves you can teach an old doll
new tricks. Reinventing the Cinderella story in a way that targets
``Titanic''-loving teens, the movie stars Drew Barrymore as the

Dougray Scott as a prince who's more than just another trophy
husband.

   ``Happiness'' may be the most ironic movie title of the '90s.
This controversial film is a bleak, unsparing and yet relentlessly

``sad comedy'' to ``black comedy,'' but ``Happiness'' is about as
dark as they come.

   A mild comedy-drama that wastes Eddie Murphy's talents as a New

   There is more style than substance in this re-creation of the
glam-rock scene in '70s London. Jonathan Rhys Meyers has the
central role of a rock star whose abrupt disappearance becomes the

   A watered-down comedy. After a successful stab at romantic

NETANYAHU DEMANDS OFFICIAL VOTE BY PALESTINIANS ON COVENANT
LANGUAGE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DEBORAH SONTAG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu convened his
Cabinet on Thursday to ratify the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord
after a weeklong delay that established what is likely to be a
pattern of Israeli ultimatums, Palestinian protests and American
mediation.
</P>
<P>
   But as soon as he opened the meeting, Netanyahu issued a new
demand that went way beyond the terms of the written accord and was
immediately rejected by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   He pronounced that the whole deal would crumble if the
Palestinians did not formally revoke the covenant calling for
Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``They vote to annul the provisions, we will say they did their
part,'' Netanyahu said, during a break seven hours after the
Cabinet meeting began. ``If not, we simply won't give them the
territory.''
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the day the Cabinet had been expected to
approve the land-for-security plan, signed at the White House two
weeks ago, either on Friday or, after the Jewish Sabbath, on
Sunday. By midnight, however, it was no longer so certain.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's declaration was another sign that, facing threats
from the right wing to topple his government, he has chosen to
adopt an aggressive public posture toward the Palestinians even as
he moves closer to giving them more West Bank land.
</P>
<P>
   And after the Palestinians' rejection, the signposts to the next
Israeli-Palestinian showdown were clear.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's demand reopened a sensitive issue that was solved by
a compromise during the peace talks at the Wye Plantation in
Maryland. There the Palestinians agreed to ``invite'' legislators
to a meeting that would be attended by President Clinton, where
they would ``reaffirm'' what they consider to have been the
cancellation of the offending clauses in their covenant two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will not be anything that is called a vote,'' Ahmed
Qurei, known as Abu Ala, the senior Palestinian negotiator, said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Later Netanyahu responded, ``If they do not vote, there will be
no continuation of the process.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Cabinet recessed around midnight, the ministers issued
a statement demanding ``clarification'' from Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader, about whether there would be a vote, what kind
of vote it would be and by whom. Some ministers went further,
insisting that the Cabinet vote should be delayed until the
clarification was received.
</P>
<P>
   During the one-week delay before Thursday's meeting, in which
Netanyahu awaited a Palestinian commitment to jail 30 fugitive
terrorists, Israel had already rankled both the Palestinians and
the Americans. It unleashed a volley of vitriol between the two
sides, which worsened Thursday, fraying the fragile spirit of
cooperation at the start of what was originally expected to be a
12-week period of putting the accord into effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're off to quite a rough start, and they haven't even
begun to transfer territory,'' said Joseph Alpher, Israeli director
of the American Jewish Committee. ``It bodes ill for the
implementation.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, who has been house-bound with an
ear infection since his return from peace talks in Washington,
emerged from his ranch in southern Israel to attend the meeting.
And, for the first time, he acknowledged Thursday that he would
vote for the agreement he helped to broker in Maryland, contrary to
his earlier insistence that he never would.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his illness, Sharon looked as robust as ever as he
helped Netanyahu face down his right-wing ministers, who squirmed
as Sharon, a longtime hawk, played the role of defending a
territorial giveaway.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing for the first time maps that showed how the West
Bank would be chopped up, the ministers gave Sharon, the longtime
defender of the Jewish settlements there, a particularly hard time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You disappointed us,'' Rabbi Yitzhak Levy, the education
minister, told him, according to Israeli television's Channel Two.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli Defense Forces radio reported that nine new
settlements would become isolated islands in Palestinian-ruled
territory after troops withdrew from an additional 27 percent of
the West Bank under the agreement. About half of that land was
already under Palestinian civil control.
</P>
<P>
   By whatever margin it approves the agreement, however, the
Cabinet is likely to shackle its approval to a series of demands
that go beyond the accord _ that in the third redeployment, for
instance, Israel would turn over no more than an additional 1
percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   This underscores the holes in the accord signed in Washington.
Several divisive issues were left out or left vague, like the
arrests of the 30 fugitives, but they are still alive and
contentious, threatening the fragile cooperation between the
Israelis and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis went into the negotiations demanding that the
Palestinians reduce their police force, for instance, but they came
out with a written guarantee only that the Palestinians would
submit a list of who was on the force.
</P>
<P>
   The time line for carrying out the agreement is tight. The
interim peace agreement established in Oslo in 1993, which is the
framework for the most recent, more modest accord, expires in May.
Arafat has threatened to declare a Palestinian state then if the
promises in the Oslo agreement have not been met. ``Final status''
negotiations remain, dealing with the thorniest issues, like
borders, the fate of Jerusalem and the return of Palestinian
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   In what was to have been a triumphant moment, Arafat was
supposed to have inaugurated the new Palestinian airport in Gaza
Thursday by arriving home there from Madrid. But the Israelis
prohibited his landing because the government has not yet ratified
the accord, which would allow the long-completed airport to open.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Arafat landed in Egypt, and crossed into Gaza by
helicopter.

CELLUCI SAYS HE'LL HELP TEACHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Governor Paul Cellucci, lamenting his ``bad rap'' as a
teacher basher during the campaign, extended an olive branch to
those who make their living in the classroom Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In a wide-ranging interview with the Globe in his corner office,
Cellucci said one of the first things he will do as governor will
be to inspire bright young people to become teachers and help those
who have already chosen that career to continue learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that I want to put a little focus on is professional
development for teachers. I've got some recommendations coming up
there,'' said Cellucci, who did not elaborate. ``I think I got a
bad rap as a teacher basher. I never bashed a teacher. I think
teaching is the most important job in our society.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said that although the state will fund the last step of
the more than $1 billion education reform program this year, he may
push beyond that benchmark to increase spending on such things as a
scholarship program encouraging top students to become teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to work on recruiting more people into the
profession,'' Cellucci said. ``We've put this scholarship program
in place that we'd like to expand to offer the top performing high
school kids scholarships at a state university or one of the state
colleges if they agree to receive a teaching degree and teach in
Massachusetts for four years.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Cellucci took a drubbing from teachers when he won
tougher teacher testing standards after 59 percent of prospective
teachers could not pass a basic skills portion of the state's first
such exam.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the poor test scores, Cellucci and legislative
leaders announced a broad-ranging plan to restore prestige to
teaching, offering such things as $20,000 signing bonuses for new
hires. The plan will cost between $5 million and $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci is also seeking to test current teachers, something
that has drawn the ire of teacher unions and helped earn him his
teacher basher moniker.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how much expanding scholarship programs and
teacher development will cost.
</P>
<P>
   But the price could be estimated in more than dollars because it
will be weighed against Cellucci's other major initiative for the
coming Legislative session: A $1 billion tax cut that would result
from reducing the earned income tax rate from 5.95 percent to 5
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   And once again, House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran warned Thursday
that he would look critically on allowing such a massive tax
reduction, especially if funding for education is increased. But
the chances of both proposals happening in a year when the economy
is uncertain are slim, Finneran said.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a $20 billon budget, he is talking about ripping out 10
percent of the revenues,'' Finneran said. ``To pull 10 percent out
of the revenue side of our balance sheet might inhibit our ability
to do what you have promised to do in the area of education.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, however, insists the state can survive just fine with
less revenue and more spent on education and he is going to push
for both.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the right thing for our families,'' Cellucci said. ``It's
the right thing for the competitive position of our economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor also stressed the need to expand subsidized health
care to more families, adding that he expects to sign up another
100,000 recipients this year.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, Cellucci announced the establishment of a
transition team, led by lieutenant governor-elect Jane Swift, to
bring new energy and ideas to the administration.
</P>
<P>
   That team will be comprised of four groups overseeing education,
family and health care, the economy and fiscal policy, and quality
of life issues, which includes such things as public safety and the
environment. The administration has not announced any appointments
to those posts, but some will be recruiting from the private
sector, Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   Swift, who had a baby girl two weeks before the election, will
bring a new perspective to the administration,'' Cellucci added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when we're talking about child care and issues that
are important to working mothers it will be very helpful to have
someone who is living that experience,'' Cellucci said. ``I think
it's a very good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeling empowered by his margin of victory -- garnering a
greater percentage of the vote than he and former Governor William
F. Weld received in 1990 -- Cellucci said he believes he has a
``mandate'' from the voters on implementing the death penalty,
lowering taxes and improving education.

UN REPORT CITES MURDER OF AFGHANIS BY TALIBAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Afghanistan's Sunni Muslim Taliban murdered as
many as 4,000 civilians last August during a military campaign
aimed partly at wiping out the country's Shiite Muslim minority,
according to a UN report released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The killings began on Aug. 8, as the Taliban's army marched into
the northern Afghan stronghold of Mazar-I-Sharif. The report,
prepared by the UN human rights watchdog for Afghanistan, charged
the Taliban with targeting the city's ethnic Hazara residents, who
are Shiite Muslims, during a ``killing frenzy'' that lasted for two
weeks. As many as 3,000 Hazaras were executed in the first week
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers view the killings as retaliation for the May 1997
murders of some 2,000 to 3,000 Taliban troops in Mazar-I-Sharif.
Taliban forces, who entered the city under an agreement with a
local armed faction, later came under attack by another faction,
Hezb-I-Wahadat, the army of the ethnic Hazara community. Taliban
soldiers who survived the fighting were executed in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   In last summer's slaughter, Taliban forces, armed with machine
guns, entered the town and began indiscriminately killing women,
children, and the elderly. Shop owners, beggars, and some 35 boys
selling soft drinks on the street were also gunned down. Even the
town's donkeys, goats, and sheep were killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The arbitrary and indiscriminate killing and shooting lasted
the whole first day,'' wrote Choong-Hyun Paik of South Korea, the
UN human rights rapporteur for Afghanistan. ``Bodies remained on
the street for between four days and one week before inhabitants
were allowed to remove them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the following days, the Taliban conducted door-to-door
searches in the town, singling out the homes of ethnic Hazaras.
Residents were dragged from their homes and murdered.
</P>
<P>
   ``All killings were seen as systematic, planned and very
well-organized,'' Paik said. ``Many witnesses stated that the
Taliban knew exactly where to go, and even knew which houses were
owned by Hazaras.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said that surviving members of the town's Shiites
were ordered to renounce their brand of Islam or die.
</P>
<P>
   ``The loudspeakers of all mosques were used to call on the
surviving members to convert ... ``unless they wanted to be treated
like dogs and shot on the spot,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In a letter to the United Nations, the Taliban said the
``accusations are baseless, and are only directed to disrespect
Islam. The world will necessarily find out the truth in the course
of time.''
</P>
<P>
   The reports findings were impossible to corroborate
independently. A State Department official said Thursday that the
Taliban has refused US and UN appeals to allow a comprehensive
international investigation into the massacres.
</P>
<P>
   Paik, who resigned two weeks ago in frustration at being denied
access to the region by the Taliban, said that he had not traveled
to the site of the massacres or to the refugee camps in Pakistan,
where many of the survivors fled. But the report comes days after a
leading human rights organization released the findings of its own
investigation, based on interview with Afghan refugees in Pakistan,
that repeat many of the basic charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a very brutal war, this is a particularly brutal episode,''
said Patrician Gossman, a senior researcher for Human Rights Watch,
which produced a smaller estimate of the scale of the killings.
``We are talking about the systematic execution of perhaps 2,000
civilians, in large part because of their ethnic and religious
identity.''

PHILADELPHIA NAMED SITE FOR GOP CONVENTION IN 2000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans on Thursday selected Philadelphia as
the site for their 2000 presidential convention, rejecting four
other cities that had pledged millions of dollars to help stage the
political event.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing Philadelphia, the Republican National Committee's
site-selection team turned down bids from Indianapolis, New
Orleans, New York and San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Liberty Bell and Independence Hall will make a compelling
backdrop for nominating a president and promoting our party's
vision for a better America in the 21st century,'' Jim Nicholson,
the RNC chairman, said in announcing the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia bid $35 million, Indianapolis offered $25 million,
New York topped the pledges at $40 million and New Orleans offered
$22.5 million. The committee rejected San Antonio when the city's
business leaders failed to guarantee their portion of a $21.5
million bid.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Philadelphia also rewards Pennsylvania Gov. Tom
Ridge, a moderate Republican who could be in line for a Cabinet
post in a Republican administration.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in recent years that the party has turned
down San Antonio, a city that has promoted its ethnic diversity in
trying to attract the convention. The GOP picked San Diego over the
Texas city as the site of the 1996 convention.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who is seen as a front-runner for the
Republican presidential nomination in 2000, expressed
disappointment in the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Antonio is a great convention city, and this would have
been a great chance to show how Hispanics and Anglos work and live
side by side in one of the nation's largest and most vibrant
cities,'' said Bush, who won a landslide re-election Tuesday with
heavy support from Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Weddington, chairwoman of the Texas Republican Party, also
was dismayed by the national party's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, I am a bit bewildered by the decision considering
recent Republican victories and the growing Republican Hispanic
population in Texas,'' she said. ``I thought these factors and the
appeal of the city of San Antonio itself would have made Texas the
obvious choice to host the convention.''
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio's bid of $21.5 million included $6.5 million in city
services and $15 million in cash pledged by business leaders and
money to be raised by Bush and U.S. Sens. Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey
Hutchison, both Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Former San Antonio Mayor Nelson Wolff said the city's bid was
eliminated because the private-sector portion of the bid could not
be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought all along that that would defeat us,'' Wolff said.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio lost out to San Diego for the 1996 presidential
convention when the California city upped its bid by $5 million in
the final hours of the selection process.
</P>
<P>
   But California Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, failed to raise
the money and left the RNC with a $4.5 million deficit. The RNC was
leery of being left short in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia and Indianapolis guaranteed the cash portion of
their bids.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis, for instance, had $13 million in an economic
development fund raised by a hotel-motel tax to use as collateral.
Philadelphia pledged city funds to offset any private shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Philadelphia and Indianapolis included festivals
for convention delegates during the week-long event. Those events
grabbed the RNC's attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found Philadelphia is the city with the best combination of
what we need for an outstanding convention,'' said Jan Larimer,
head of the RNC's site selection committee.
</P>
<P>
   Tipping the scales, Larimer said, were Philadelphia's ``great
facilities, superior hotel accommodations, strong financing and
countless activities for our delegates and their families.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike McDaniel, Indiana GOP chairman, said he was disappointed
that Indianapolis finished second behind Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we are proud of the effort we made and as far along as we
got,'' McDaniel said. ``We'll have a great convention in
Philadelphia.''
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio leaders had hoped that Bush's overwhelming
re-election victory would boost the city's chances to land the
convention. Bush received 46 percent of the state's Hispanic vote,
and San Antonio made the courtship of Hispanics its strongest
argument for the GOP convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Presidential politics did not enter into the decision,'' said
Tim Fitzpatrick, an RNC spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia selection must be ratified by a the full
Republican National Committee at its winter meeting in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The party conventions are highly coveted by cities because the
week-long events, which culminate in the nomination of the party's
presidential nominee, are a boon, injecting as much as $100 million
into the local economy, according to RNC estimates.

`UNIVERSAL CELL' SAID TO REPRODUCE HUMAN TISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists say they have captured and tamed a universal human
cell that can reproduce forever in a laboratory dish and has the
potential to form any kind of cell in the human body.
</P>
<P>
   A report Friday on the achievement sketches a future in which
doctors might have an unlimited supply of made-to-order cells,
tissues and organs for transplant into patients for diseases
ranging from heart attacks to diabetes, Alzheimer's and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, studies made possible by the human embryonic stem
cell, or ES cell, could unlock secrets of infertility, early
development of the human fetus, and birth defects, say the
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The landmark work is being published in the journal Science by
biologist James A. Thomson and colleagues from the University of
Wisconsin and at the Technion University in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's enormous therapeutic potential here, and I'm confident
that there will be therapies in my lifetime,'' said Thomson, while
cautioning that it will be many years before the technology can be
applied to people.
</P>
<P>
   The team showed that the human ES cells could be maintained
indefinitely in the laboratory _ immortalized, in the technical
term _ and, when injected into mice, could form several different
types of body cells. But the scientists don't yet know how to steer
the stem cells into producing desired types of cells on demand.
</P>
<P>
   The isolation of human ES cells had been hotly pursued for years
in a number of laboratories, and one scientist, John Gearhart of
the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, said last summer that
he &UR;  &LR; had captured the elusive cell. But today's report is the first
official publication.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report...represents a major technical achievement with
great importance for human biology,'' Gearhart said in a commentary
accompanying the Wisconsin research article in Science. Gearhart
and colleagues are publishing their own report of human ES cell
isolation in next week's issue of the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The Wisconsin team isolated the cells, which are present only
fleetingly in the first few days of embryonic life, from
five-day-old embryos, called blastocysts, that had been created
through in vitro fertilization. The embryos were extra ones donated
by couples in Wisconsin and Israel who had undergone the
infertility treatment and who no longer wanted them.
</P>
<P>
   Because federal regulations banning research that risks harm to
human embryos, the stem cell hunt has been funded by the private
sector, and Thomson's work was carried out in a lab separate from
his university research.
</P>
<P>
   The major private funder, Geron Corp. of Menlo Park, Calif.,
established an independent ethical review board to evaluate the
isolation and use of human stem cells, said Dr. Thomas Okarma,
Geron's vice president of research and development.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board issued a statement that this research can be
conducted ethically as long as certain guidelines are followed,''
said Okarma.
</P>
<P>
   He stressed that although the stem cells potentially can create
tissues and organs, they lack the ability to develop into a fetus.
``We are not going to clone humans or transfer these cells into a
womb,'' said Okarma.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harold Varmus, director of the National Institutes of
Health, has directed its legal counsel to determine whether the
government could legally fund further development of the
laboratory-grown ES cells, since no new human embryo material would
be needed, said an official.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NIH recognizes how exciting this work is and the
tremendous potential it holds for science and for medicine,'' said
Lana Skirboll, director of science policy at NIH.
</P>
<P>
   Geron stock was traded at about 40 times normal daily volume
Thursday, and closed up 2 5/16, before the news was officially
released, but after the company issued an invitation to a 5:15 p.m.
conference call concerning ``recent corporate events,'' according
to Bloomberg Business News.
</P>
<P>
   Embryonic stem cells have been isolated in a number of animal
species over the last decade, so their presence in human embryos
was not a surprise. ES cell from mice are now commonly used to
create experimental mice with desired genetic traits.
</P>
<P>
   Michael West, a founder of Geron who now heads Advanced Cell
Technology in Shrewsbury, Mass., said that because the ES cells
continually divide in the lab, they will be good targets for
genetic engineering to give them desired traits, making them
compatible with the immune systems of transplant recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolf Jaenisch &UR;  &LR; of the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Mass.
commented:
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be a little bit cautious about this. (The scientists)
have to learn how to favor differentiation of the stem cells down
various developmental pathways'' before they can create desired
cells and tissues, he said. ``And this is not easy, even in the
mouse.''

   NICARAGUA-MUDSLIDES (Posoltega, Nicaragua) _ Where just a week

ready for harvest, there are now only discolored corpses, swelling
grotesquely in the sun. For Central America, Hurricane Mitch and
the floods and landslides that followed in the storm's wake have
been a catastrophe. But no place has been harder hit than this
collection of humble agricultural settlements, where at least 1,500
people, and perhaps many many more, perished when a series of

   FED-GREENSPAN (Washington) _ Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve
chairman, says that investors and lenders appear to be calming
down, suggesting that the central bank is less concerned now that a
credit squeeze could derail the economy. While reassuring, his
comments are interpreted on Wall Street to mean that the Fed might
see less need to reduce interest rates again at its next policy
meeting on Nov. 17. But the inadvertent release by the Labor
Department of employment data for October, showing that the economy
is gradually slowing, reinforces the case for a rate cut. By

 &HT;    Judge tells Microsoft to speed up its case
 &HT;    By Andrew J. Glass
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson voiced
his mounting frustration Thursday over both the thrust and pace of
the software company's courtroom tactics after presiding for three
weeks over the Microsoft antitrust trial.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in the trial, Jackson sustained a government
objection when a Microsoft lawyer sought to cross-examine an Apple
Computer Inc. executive about an 11-page technical document
downloaded from a Netscape Communications Corp. Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things are credible on the Web that are not
necessarily admissible (in court),'' Jackson told Microsoft lawyer
Theodore Edelman.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief recess, Apple Senior Vice President Avadis
Tevanian Jr. said he couldn't begin to comprehend the new defense
exhibit. When Edelman nevertheless persisted in seeking to question
Tevanian about the Netscape paper, Jackson's wrath showed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you better go on to another subject,'' he told
Edelman.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also rebuked Edelman after the attorney had asked
Tevanian about internal Apple e-mails that assessed Microsoft's
offer to collaborate on multimedia technology for personal
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Tevanian testified Microsoft had employed what he termed
``threats'' to pressure Apple to scrap its QuickTime multimedia
software for Windows so it could more easily market its own budding
NetShow product.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are talking about pros and cons,'' Tevanian said,
referring to the engineers who were weighing Microsoft's 1997 offer
_ an offer, Tevanian added, that ``didn't make sense to us.''
</P>
<P>
   When Edelman had several times called the internal e-mail
exchanges as ``Apple proposals to Microsoft,'' Jackson jumped in.
``You keep mischaracterizing what he told you,'' the judge
interjected, displaying rising impatience with Edelman's sarcastic
courtroom manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The witness just said this was not a proposal,'' Jackson
added. ``This was a pre-decisional communication by two Apple
engineers discussing a proposal which was explicitly rejected by
Mr. Tevanian and others. It's misleading language, and it is not
acceptable to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also directly questioned Tevanian about whether
Sherlock, a program to find information on ar computer or on the
Internet, was ``built in'' to Apple's operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The government bases its antitrust suit against Microsoft partly
on charges it linked products such as its Internet Explorer Web
browser to its Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Tevanian replied that the product was not ``built in,'' but
``bundled'' with the operating system, a defense Microsoft has
employed in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Tevanian, the government's third witness, will return Monday for
a quick round of friendly questions from Justice Department
attorney Phillip Malone.
</P>
<P>
   In two full days on the witness stand, Tevanian stoutly
maintained Microsoft had threatened to scuttle an upgrade of its
popular Office for Mac software to force Apple to give Internet
Explorer a favored position on Macintosh computers.
</P>
<P>
   Edelman sought to repair some of the damage from this testimony
by showing a statement videotaped before the trial by Steven
Decker, the procurement officer for Compaq Computer's Presario
line.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Compaq had refused to bundle Apple's QuickTime 3.0
multimedia software in Presario models under pressure from
Microsoft, Decker replied: ``That's actually false. We'd be
shipping QuickTime today if Apple were giving it to us for free.''
</P>
<P>
   In his direct testimony, Tevanian had quoted fellow Apple
executive Phil Schiller as having been told by Decker: ``You have
to understand what's going on here. (Compaq is) very afraid of
doing anything to upset Microsoft. We are very wary of bundling
anything that would upset Microsoft because they touch us in so
many places.

 &HT;    Family Journeys: Dad and daughter bridge the years on odyssey
into Irish heritage
 &HT;    By Mike Tierney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland_ So, Dad,'' came the voice of my firstborn,
Shannon, over the telephone, ``when are we going to Ireland _ like
you promised me?''
</P>
<P>
   The silence was long enough for a dime to ring up on my phone
bill. A 128-megs-of-ram search through my memory found no trace of
the alleged pledge. Even so, the idea sounded grand, to borrow a
term I'd heard often on my previous excursion, sans children, to
the Emerald Isle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next summer,'' I assured her while, this time, documenting our
conversation in my calendar book.
</P>
<P>
   A year passed, and in August we excitedly wedged ourselves onto
a sold-out Delta flight to launch a week in our ancestral homeland.
For now, though, the only kin I cared about was Shannon.
</P>
<P>
   We had lived under separate roofs since the divorce in 1984, and
in different states for a dozen years. We were as close as I could
hope for, given that our contact had been limited to summertime or
holiday visits mixed with sporadic letters and phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   When she brought home straight-A report cards, I wasn't there.
When her prom date rang the doorbell, I wasn't there. When she
needed some adolescent-era bogeyman frightened off, I wasn't there.
When she elected to enter medical school in St. Louis, when she
zeroed in on surgery as a career....
</P>
<P>
   How odd that we would bridge the distance between us by
cavorting on another continent. A mini-family reunion, this would
be. Well, that was my take on the trip. To Shannon, 22, it was an
escape from summer jobs and studies, her introduction to a foreign
land and different culture.
</P>
<P>
   Miles above the Atlantic, concern set in. How would we get
along? We are control freaks, passive but easily annoyed. She comes
by these traits honestly. I have no ready excuse.
</P>
<P>
   And somebody summon Madeleine Albright if the conversation
should veer toward politics. In college, the newspaper I helped
edit endorsed McGovern for president, and we were banned from a
Nixon speech; as a teen, Shannon volunteered for the Bush campaign
and defended Quayle. A few days after Kent State, I unwittingly
fell into a group that torched a campus ROTC building; her
boyfriend attended school on a ROTC scholarship. We are far enough
from the center, in opposite directions, that no wide-angle lens
could capture both of us.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the only politics on our minds was the tenuous
Irish truce between Catholics and Protestants. And, aside from
mapping out our figure-eight course, insisting only on detours to
three horse racetracks, I let her set the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Our own peace was tested at the outset in Dublin. Put me in a
rental car with the steering wheel on the passenger side, then
force me to drive in the left lane and read camouflaged road signs
the size of pizza boxes, and I will assuredly get lost.
</P>
<P>
   On our needle-in-a-haystack hunt for the hotel, I turned onto a
crowded pedestrian-only block, tried to retreat and could not shift
into reverse. An eternity passed while three sympathetic locals
took turns sliding behind the wheel before one discovered a latch
hidden at the base of the stick shift. We wiggled out with no
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   What should have been a 20-minute drive evolved into two hours.
But a mix of exhaustion and euphoria mellowed Shannon and she took
it in stride, which I interpreted as a welcome omen.
</P>
<P>
   Treading lightly traveled paths
</P>
<P>
   On overseas trips, my desires are pathetically low-brow: Find a
place to drink, dine, gamble, exercise, listen to live music or
mingle with the natives.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Shannon, who napped briefly after we checked in,
then arose in a sightseer's mood, guidebook in hand. First
destination: the Book of Kells, 8th-century Bible manuscripts
housed at the venerable Trinity College. ``Sure,'' I said, ``what
are they?''
</P>
<P>
   If looks could kill ...
</P>
<P>
   By the next morning, she had opened my eyes to the fact that we
were surrounded by landmarks whose significance reaches deep into
the past. Not only to be viewed, but experienced.
</P>
<P>
   At St. Patrick's Cathedral, we extended a look-see into a
morning of worship. Only by communing with the congregation could
we fully appreciate this museum/church, with its occupied crypts,
stained glass that belongs in the Louvre, neck-craning high walls
and plaques commemorating Irish heroes from distant centuries.
Neither of us regular church-goers, we were awed nonetheless. She
lit a candle for a cancer-stricken acquaintance, while I prayed for
peace.
</P>
<P>
   During the week, we went down the beaten visitors' paths, to
such magnets as the Blarney Castle. I warned Shannon that, to kiss
the Blarney Stone, you must climb a claustrophobic staircase limb
several flights to the roof, lie on your back and lean backwards
into an opening of the ceiling while a man holds your forelegs to
keep you from tumbling into the abyss. She, of course, did it. I,
naturally, did not.
</P>
<P>
   And to the Waterford Crystal Factory, where we watched,
mesmerized, as the factory artisans transformed liquid into
creative glasswork.
</P>
<P>
   But we also took lightly traveled tourist roads. Along the Ring
of Kerry, Shannon spotted a turn-off toward a 3,000-year-old fort,
billed as the country's oldest. Two winding miles later, we came
upon a small, roof-less structure of stones crammed together
without mortar. There was no admission fee, no narrator, one sign
with the briefest background and another that implored ``Do Not
Remove The Stones.''
</P>
<P>
   And to the Skeelig Islands, an obscure sideshow that satiated
our sense of adventure, good and bad. We had secured the final two
seats on the only ferry out of five not booked solid. (This, before
we had stumbled onto the last available room in town, courtesy of a
no-show couple from Italy.)
</P>
<P>
   As we 13 passengers boarded, the ruddy skipper cautioned that
the 90-minute ride would be ``a bit choppy.'' Do tell. One in our
group leaned over the rail nearly an hour into the ride and shared
her breakfast with the sea. Alternating deep breaths and gulps of
bottled water, I barely managed to hold mine in.
</P>
<P>
   Our hazy destination finally came into focus, revealing a sliver
of land less than two acres, out of which arose a magnificent rock
maybe 15 stories high. Shannon explained that the makeshift rooms
at the top were once a monastery, built in the 6th or 7th century
by monks who were hiding out from a society they believed had gone
to seed.
</P>
<P>
   We docked and began our winding ascent, past occasional
``danger'' signs. More than halfway toward the heavens, we spread
out on a field of grass and dandelions, fetched our sandwiches and
picnicked. We looked down to our left and saw crashing waves of
aqua. To our right and below, passive waters of a darker hue lapped
the base of the rock. The warmth of the sun, which seemed so close,
negated the stiff breeze. We had climbed more than 500 steps, each
created out of stone by the monks, and were staring up at 150 more.
The double dose of history and nature, more so than the altitude
and narrow staircase, took our breath away.
</P>
<P>
   On the ride back to shore, we swung by the smaller island,
off-limits to humans. An estimated 10,000 white birds _ and their
droppings _ blanketed its rock. We ventured near enough to spot
seals, standing sentry.
</P>
<P>
   Their wondrous sighting was not enough to ease Shannon's
advancing pain. Her hands, aching from sunburn and windburn, nearly
brought her to tears. Pouring bottled water over them provided
little relief. It was her first, and last, forgettable moment.
</P>
<P>
   Soaking up Ireland by the pint
</P>
<P>
   I didn't have to twist her arm to accomodate my affection for
Irish taverns. On our first night, during a pub crawl in Dublin's
Temple Bar district _ Buckhead with a brogue _ she declared her
intentions to sample each indigenous beer she could find. After we
tapped our feet to a wonderful Irish band _ the adjective is
redundant in these parts _ and chatted up some lads from Northern
Ireland who became the first of many to wish us a glorious stay,
she never resisted my invitation indoors for a pint.
</P>
<P>
   Our mid-afternoon thirst-quenching ritual one day led us to our
namesake, Tierney's Bar &AMP; Restaurant _ proud champion pub of
Tipperary County four years running, as the lettering advertised.
Well, they ought to have a sign designating Mr. Sean Tierney as My
Least Cordial Distant Cousin. My last time here, the proprietor hid
for an hour. When I corralled him at the front door, he complained
about the burden of greeting all of the traveling Tierneys.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon could care less. At the bar, she had found a new beer.
</P>
<P>
   In Ireland, drinking establishments are cheery social centers,
not the pick-up joints or chug-a-lug frat houses that describe so
many American bars. In fact, not until our second-to-last night did
Shannon notice young men ``making eyes'' at her. More typical was
The Nook in Youghal _ pronounced ``Y'all,'' no kidding _ where we
stumbled into a woman's birthday party and were approached by the
maiden of honor offering sandwiches and cake.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate pub moment held off until our final stop, an
undistinguished watering hole in Waterford where three old-timers
were glued to the bar. They introduced themselves as Smoky
Sullivan, Colly and John. They bought us beers, engaged us in
conversation about all things America, offered us free housing when
we returned and asked approximately between each sip if we were
enjoying ourselves. Shannon snapped their photo, exchanged
addresses and left beaming. ``At last,'' she said, ``this is how I
envisioned an Irish pub.''
</P>
<P>
   `I tried not to be too parent-y ...'
</P>
<P>
   Not just beer, but Shannon also announced that she would taste
all things Irish off the menu. Irish stew, mussels ... even black
pudding.
</P>
<P>
   Pudding, as we know pudding, it is not, but instead round, small
and solid, like a sausage patty. Black, it is, at least on the
outside. At breakfast, when she carved off a bite for me that
revealed reddish insides, I inquired about ingredients. Animal
blood, she said, nibbling away. ``You only live once.'' I stuck
with the ham and eggs.
</P>
<P>
   I had brought Shannon partly to open new doors to her. And here
she was, opening old doors for me, reminding me that the
risk-taking I embraced at her age had been co-opted by a creature
of habit, too often playing it safe.
</P>
<P>
   Once, I worried that I had exposed Shannon to too much. After
hearing her lament that she was overly career-driven and not
carefree enough, I envisioned her ditching med school for
bartending school. It was thus reassuring to hear these subsequent
words from her: ``Do you think they need any pediatric surgeons
over here?''
</P>
<P>
   If doors were not opened, at least tongues were loosened.
Conversations delved into unexplored territory for us. Boys (for
her), women (for me). Her feelings toward my 8-year-old son, her
stepbrother. Regrettable things we had done. Would we, could we,
have broached those subjects back home?
</P>
<P>
   We had observed incredible scenes. The beachcomber community
that had seemed airlifted from the Florida Panhandle and plopped
down along the Irish Sea. The town dotted with green and pink
houses. The herd of maybe 50 sheep trotting up a side road toward
the main drag, where a motorist blocked off the intersection for
them.
</P>
<P>
   We had inhaled incredible scents. Near the Blarney Castle, we
had wandered into a swampy area and became overwhelmed by nature's
intoxicatingly wondrous odor. ``If you could bottle this,'' Shannon
said, ``all fragrance-makers would be put out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   We had stayed one night in accomodations unmatched in my life's
globe-trotting, the Kilkea Castle an hour southwest of Dublin. From
the outside, it looks every bit its 818 years. But the rooms are
royally stocked with antique chest-of-drawers and writing desks,
while the closets reveal thick terrycloth robes and the bathrooms
are equipped with gold fixtures and a bidet. Sitting beneath
crystal chandeliers, we gorged ourselves on a five-course meal in a
whisper-quiet restaurant. The next morning, we passed on the
million-dollar fitness center/pool to sweat out the meal with a jog
amid the hares and swans, under flower-coated trellises, along the
golf course surrounding Ireland's oldest inhabitable castle.
</P>
<P>
   I tried not to be too parent-y but suffered occasional lapses.
When things didn't go as planned _ a wrong turn, an ATM spitting
back my credit card when we were penniless and poundless, B&AMP;Bs with
no-vacancy signs as far as the eye could see _ I explained that
travel means expecting the unexpected. Taking the bad with the
good. If Shannon grew tired of hearing those homilies, she kept it
to herself.
</P>
<P>
   Over dinner once, she asked me to identify my favorite part of
the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching you have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   She was taken aback, then finally said, ``Thanks.''
</P>
<P>
   Postscript: `My joy is tempered ...'
</P>
<P>
   Back home but not yet back to reality, we were unpacking when
word came that a bomb had exploded in Northern Ireland, ultimately
killing 28. Anywhere, this is an unspeakable tragedy. That the bomb
was detonated amid the human race's kindest people is nothing less
than one of life's great mysteries. Instantly, we were sobered. Our
reverie had passed.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, Shannon phoned from St. Louis to inform me that her
longtime boyfriend, the ROTC guy, has proposed marriage. And, that
she has accepted. For her, I am delighted, but my joy is tempered
by the realization that when Shannon returns to Ireland, she will
be accompanied by her beloved Chip instead of me.
</P>
<P>
   I sighed and began to wonder: What long-forgotten vacation have
I promised her younger sister?

 &HT;    COLUMN: A Wolfe in chic clothing
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL NOVEMBER 8: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Wolfe, as everyone knows, dresses to the nines and some
would say the 27s. The man has got some threads, most of them
white. Working in his home, he actually wears a suit and tie. Even
on weekends. If he gets up from his typewriter _ he's still not
online! _ to fix himself a sandwich, he has be careful with the
mayo, the mustard or whatever he's lubing the thing with. He wears
creamy white shoes that somehow never get scuffed. Pat Boone's were
always spotless, too, but people don't call Tom Wolfe a
goody-two-shoes. He's Little Lord Fauntleroy with a switchblade
knife.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Mailer's never gotten over the job Wolfe did on him. The
somnambulistic souls left over from the William Shawn period at The
New Yorker still shudder at the sound of his name _ three decades
after he wrote those two magazine articles, the first under the
mortifying headline ``Tiny Mummies! The True Story of the Ruler of
43d Street's Land of the Walking Dead!''
</P>
<P>
   That was vintage Tom Wolfe, irreverent before the gods of
Culture. No one was eviscerated like Leonard Bernstein. The
Bernsteins, Lenny and Felicia, used to throw parties that all the
interesting people in Manhattan went to. Barbara Walters would go,
and Harry Belafonte and Robert Silvers, the New York Review of
Books editor, Gian Carlo Menotti, Jason Robards, Peter Duchin and
his wife, Cheray. Very chic.
</P>
<P>
   And then Lenny and Felicia began inviting others, some people
from Oakland, Calif., who were not so much chic as radical. This
was in the '60s, when Afros were big. Since part of the guest list
was chic and part was radical, Wolfe put the two together and
called it Radical Chic. Made sense. The rads got first billing
because the chics were really quite taken with them. Smitten, in
fact.
</P>
<P>
   At one of those parties, Cheray Duchin meets this guy from
Oakland named Robert Bay. Robert is what was in those days called a
Black Panther. You can imagine the scene: Park Avenue. Panthers in
the penthouse. They're munching on Roquefort cheese rolled in nuts
of some kind, and the glittery people are cooing and fawning all
over Robert and the rest of them.
</P>
<P>
   Felicia greets them ``with the same bend of the wrist, the same
tilt of the head, the same perfect Mary Astor voice with which she
greets people like Jason, John and D.D., Adolph, Betty, Gian Carlo.
...'' It's a lovely evening, and cross-cultural too. Cheray tells
Felicia: ``I've never met a Panther _ this is a first for me!''
</P>
<P>
   And here's Tom Wolfe, standing off to the side, munching his own
cheese ball with nuts, and he's thinking: ``This is a first for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   You wonder how he got invited. You wonder a lot of things, but
you really wonder how this impish guy in a white suit, with eyes
and ears as alert as the antennae of a cockroach, got his foot in
the door.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Wolfe's been getting in doors for longer than most of us can
remember. We grew up with him. But he comes to Atlanta and somebody
gives him the run of the place. ``A Man in Full'' (Farrar, Straus &AMP;
Giroux, $28.95), his new novel just arriving in bookstores, is said
to do for Atlanta what ``The Bonfire of the Vanities'' did 11 years
ago for New York _ strip us bare, show us all our pretensions (we
didn't know them?) and show them to everybody else. Like, a million
or so people. And when the movie comes out, which it will, who
knows how many more?
</P>
<P>
   Let the mandarins of High Art maunder on about the human heart
(as William Faulkner, four sheets to the wind, did on accepting his
Nobel Prize) and things transcendent. Wolfe tells us about society
and status _ the ``statusphere,'' he once called it. Long before he
wrote ``Bonfire,'' his first novel, he made clear his view that
contemporary fiction was a well gone dry. Philip Roth, Norman
Mailer et al. were contemplating their bellybuttons when they
weren't rehashing their divorces. Worse, lesser novelists, holed up
in university writing programs, had become cloistered like
Trappists, singing their vespers in isolation from the outside
world.
</P>
<P>
   Fiction, in short, had abandoned the field that Balzac and
Dickens once mined, and the journalists had taken squatter's
rights. If the novelists didn't know where real life was, the
journalists did. ``My conviction,'' Wolfe told an interviewer
almost 20 years ago, ``is that the fundamental unit in analyzing
behavior is not the individual, but some sort of status group or
status structure. Who is in competition with whom and why? What are
the stakes and rules?''
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to hang around, observe, listen, record. Wolfe's
been doing it for longer than people realize. As the sun was
setting on the Eisenhower administration, Wolfe was breaking in as
a reporter for The Washington Post. That's when he started having
his clothes custom-made, a dandy even on deadline.
</P>
<P>
   In time he would write about the most unlikely subjects
imaginable: hippies on LSD, car customizers (Kar Kustomizers) in
California, Las Vegas billboard artists, the Peppermint Lounge.
``All these rancid people,'' he wrote in his first collection of
articles, ``are creating new styles all the time and changing the
life of the whole country in ways that nobody even seems to bother
to record, much less analyze.''
</P>
<P>
   But he kept upping the ante, taking on subjects of greater
status. In time he even got inside the space program. The flyboys
don't like him, even though he liked them. That book he wrote, it
should've been called ``The Wrong Stuff,'' one of them muttered.
</P>
<P>
   And the art crowd, they have no use for him at all. They're a
serious bunch, and they know a lot of hard words. The kind you
learn in graduate school. Wolfe should have understood that. He
went to graduate school himself, and at Yale. He even got a Ph.D.,
in something called American studies. But when he made fun of art
criticism in ``The Painted Word,'' it was like the smarty pants in
the back of the class, smirking at teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever really important people were, sooner or later you'd
find a prim hanger-on in a white suit, pinched collar and those
immaculate white shoes. Nobody has sized him up more perceptively
than Joseph Epstein. Tom Wolfe, Epstein once wrote in The New
Criterion, ``may be the only writer since Mark Twain to dress for
the job. Two white-suited Southerners, Twain and Wolfe resemble
nothing so much as characters who have somehow wandered off the
stage of a production of Jerome Kern's `Show Boat.'''
</P>
<P>
   In his prose as in his attire, he lets you know he's onstage.
(``If italics were neon,'' Epstein wrote, ``his prose would long
ago have suffered a power outage.'') Wolfe himself has said as
much: ``I felt I had to grab readers by the lapels and hold them
long enough to read my stories.''
</P>
<P>
   There are those who would say the essence of style is that the
writing _ or the wardrobe _ not call attention to itself. But Wolfe
doesn't wear Brooks Brothers and he doesn't understate. He beckons
you like a carnival barker. At the same time _ this is the trick _
he's not revealing much of himself.
</P>
<P>
   The garb works as a mask. How many people know that the
68-year-old didn't marry until he was 47; that the writer he
admires most is his father, a Virginian who was editor of a journal
called The Southern Planter (``I once went to the New York Public
Library,'' he told an interviewer, ``and he had more entries in the
card file than I did''); that he tap-danced and performed ballet
when he was young; that he was good enough a pitcher to try out for
the old New York Giants (not much of a fastball but, he says, ``a
slider, a sinker and every breaking pitch known to man''); that,
despite the seeming spontaneity of his prose, he writes slowly?
</P>
<P>
   With the garb and the hyperkinetic prose as a diversion (or a
distraction), the unsuspecting are taken in by Wolfe's exuberance.
Open to everything new, Wolfe is in fact culturally conservative.
In his introduction to ``The Pump House Gang,'' he writes of
appearing on a panel with Gunter Grass and Allen Ginsberg, both of
whom looked out upon the land and saw only darkness and dread.
There was a lot of alienation, repression, oppression, etc., etc.
</P>
<P>
   Interrupting, Wolfe said: ``What are you talking about? We're in
the middle of a Happiness Explosion.'' And this was in 1968, when,
in truth, there were a few clouds in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   The catch phrases with which he has described what he saw and
heard _ The Right Stuff, The Me Decade, Radical Chic _ have passed
into the language as everyday expressions. But the ebullience and
apparent glibness belie a seriousness of purpose. Many people who
read ``The Bonfire of the Vanities'' didn't completely grasp
Wolfe's view of our cities _ a fraudulent liberality and a social
pathology living in symbiosis.
</P>
<P>
   Taking to fiction, Epstein wrote, Wolfe found a way to say
``things that no one else in our time has quite dared to say, at
least not in print, not publicly.'' They are not entirely pleasant,
but neither are they entirely wrong.
</P>
<P>
   You have to peel away the pretenses and false faces to get at
them. But most people know that, underneath, they are there. We
just layer them over with symbols of status and the accouterment of
lifestyle _ what Thorstein Veblen, an earlier social satirist,
coined as ``conspicuous consumption.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom Wolfe,'' Epstein wrote, ``is pre-eminently the chronicler
of those people who do not so much live lives as they live
lifestyles. ... They are often very savvy, even self-reflecting
about the way they live, but finally the style dominates the
life.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be said that the style, in the same self-reflecting
way, finally dominates much of Wolfe's work. It is invariably
entertaining, grabbing you by the lapels, spinning you around and
all but shaking the eyeballs out of your skull. But once you
recover your balance, what you remember best is the fop in the
white suit and white shoes, spraying dots and dashes everywhere and
lighting up the page with italics.
</P>
<P>
   Much of it but not the best of it. Now, with ``A Man in Full,''
the satirist has harnessed his gifts for observation and grounded
them in the larger concerns of fictional realism. You can reread
``The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby'' or ``The
Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test'' and laugh still. But they read like
period pieces, as distant from today as ``Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
Hearts Club Band.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a recognizable world, not oldies but goodies, that Wolfe
gives us in ``A Man in Full.'' Andrew Ferguson, in The Wall Street
Journal, caught the pith of it precisely: ``One reason novels seem
so wan and attenuated these days is our novelists' sniffy refusal
to plunge into the muck of commercial life, the dirty work of
getting and spending, even though this is, after all, where most of
us spend our time.''
</P>
<P>
   In Wolfe's portrayal of failed breadwinners _ ``middle-aged and
hopelessly unemployed, staring out the window at their son's
basketball backboards in their driveways'' _ and bankrupt dreams,
there is a pathos that survives even the gaudy exhibitionism of
this most singular stylist.

 &HT;    Myriad characters jump from creative well that is John Updike
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON_ John Updike has the munchies.
</P>
<P>
   His dinner hour was eaten up by an overeager interviewer, you
see, but now is not the most convenient moment for a snack. In a
few moments this elder statesman of American letters must stride
into the auditorium of 250-year-old Faneuil Hall, up to the same
podium where Samuel Adams railed against King George III and
William Lloyd Garrison thundered against slavery, to read passages
from his latest novel, ``Bech at Bay,'' before a crowd ranging from
backpacked students to aging business executives. They murmur now,
expectantly.
</P>
<P>
   Updike, hovering in the on-deck circle of the lobby, has a ruddy
glow of health beneath the globe lights, as if he'd spent this
gloriously crisp autumn day sailing on Massachusetts Bay (he lives
next to it, in Beverly Farms, 20 miles north of here). Looking
eminently writerly in his green-checked tweed jacket, gray slacks
and argyle socks, tilting his head with waggish charm as he gossips
with his three young handlers from Knopf, his longtime publisher,
Updike puts a crinkle of apology into his smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uh,'' he says gently, ``is there a candy store in this
building, by any chance?''
</P>
<P>
   The woman handler, startled at the late request, knows as well
as the inveterate snacker (as Updike once described himself) that
there's nary a Snickers on this national historic site, but she
gamely dashes out toward the nearby market hall. ``I trust your
judgment!'' Updike calls after her. In a few minutes he is digging
into a plastic baggie of some blue, crunchy stuff, beaming like one
closer to 6 than 66, saying to the woman, ``I don't know what this
is, but I like it. How much do I owe you?''
</P>
<P>
   It's show time: Updike mounts the stage.
</P>
<P>
   As he is introduced _ in the awe-struck tones befitting a man
who has published 49 books in 40 years and won

 &HT;    Partygoers define chic at hip birthday bash
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until Webster's gets around to finding a place for ``jiggy'' in
the New World Dictionary, people will be left to their own devices
for defining the term.
</P>
<P>
   The word jiggy, which gained widespread popularity when Will
Smith released the jaunty single ``Gettin' Jiggy With It'' last
summer, was defined in about 2,000 different ways at Atlanta,
Georgia-based rap impresario Jermaine Dupri's 26th birthday gala
held recently in Atlanta. On the invitations, guests had been
advised to dress jiggy.
</P>
<P>
   Elton John interpreted the term to mean a black Versace tuxedo
festooned with silver sequins _ with matching sequined shoes, of
course. Former Georgia Tech basketball star Stephon Marbury, who
plays for the Minnesota Timberwolves, interpreted it to mean
lug-soled boots, droopy jeans, a tank top adorned with a garish
gold necklace and a backward-turned baseball cap. Esquire magazine
writer Tom Junod's take on jiggy was a blue pinstripe suit, a
spread-collared shirt and a silver tie.
</P>
<P>
   In a breathless and imaginative attempt to give jiggy an
all-encompassing definition, Dossier magazine editor Isabel
Gonzalez described it as ``Versace-wearing, Cartier-jiggling,
tattoo-displaying, body-piercing, high heel-wearing, Gucci-toting,
attitude-
</P>
<P>
   waving money.'' As the pictures our Model Citizens shutterbug
shot show, jiggy is all that and more.

`KUNI-LEML': OLD-FASHIONED, LIGHTHEARTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at the end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Beginning its 25th anniversary season, the Jewish
Repertory Theater is looking not only to its future but also
celebrating its past. Its opening attraction is a revival of
``Kuni-Leml,'' which won the 1984 Outer Critics Circle Award for
outstanding off-Broadway musical.
</P>
<P>
   Derived from a play by Avrom Goldfadn, widely regarded as the
father of Yiddish theater, ``Kuni-Leml'' not only evokes Jewish
life in Odessa in 1880, it also sounds a modern note in its
conflict between a father's concern for tradition and a nubile
daughter's attraction to education and self-determination.
</P>
<P>
   As directed once again by Ran Avni, founder and artistic
director of the Jewish Repertory Theater, ``Kuni-Leml,'' with book
by Nahma Sandrow, music by Raphael Crystal and lyrics by Richard
Engquist, is a lighthearted, old-fashioned diversion that moves
swiftly and smoothly to its happy ending. If it never attains
exhilarating heights, and if its seems to leave some of its
potential for humor unexploited (although plenty is evident), this
musical farce is nonetheless buoyed by an engaging cast and some
sweet and sprightly tunes, and glows with enough decency and
good-heartedness to warm a crisp autumn evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kuni-Leml'' tells the story of the turbulent romance of the
willful daughter (Jennifer Rosin) of the widowed Reb Pinkhos (David
Brummel). Disdaining her real name, she calls herself Carolina,
pronounced ka-roh-LEEN-a, uses words like retinue and parasite,
drops an occasional French phrase and is not at all disposed to
lend herself to her father's intention to marry her off to some
nice Hasidic scholar.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina has her heart set on Max (Jonathan Hadley), the
enlightened tutor who taught her the fancy words and French and is
no longer welcome in Reb Pinkhos' home. But Kalmen (Paul Harman)
is. This dapper fellow, with his checked brown suit and
color-coordinated yarmulke, is the local matchmaker. And the match
he has in mind for Carolina is Kuni-Leml (Danny Gurwin). As Kalmen
sings, ``The Boy Is Perfect,'' even if he has a limp, a stutter, a
squint and various other defects.
</P>
<P>
   Reb Pinkhos accepts. Carolina still has other plans, and before
long, there are two Kuni-Lemls on stage. Drawing on the masquerade
element of Purim, the period of the action, one is Max, disguised
so well as the limping, stuttering Kuni-Leml that even the innocent
Kuni-Leml is convinced that he must be the wrong Kuni-Leml.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the wedding day arrives, there are not only two
Kuni-Lemls running on and offstage, there are also two veiled
brides, the other being Libe (Farah Alvin), the matchmaker's
neglected daughter, who finds the real Kuni-Leml to be her ideal
match.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the fun are Jay Brian Winnick and Joel Newsome, who
play dual roles, respectively, as Simkhe and Yankl, who are Reb
Pinkhos' parasitic friends, and Sasha and Yasha, Max's
mischief-making pals.
</P>
<P>
   With an orchestra led by David Wolfson adding to the spirited
proceedings, ``Kuni-Leml'' is easygoing entertainment.

   FED-GREENSPAN (Washington) _ Alan Greenspan, chairman of the
Federal Reserve, said Thursday that investors and lenders appeared
to be calming down after the fright thrown into them by global
financial turmoil, suggesting that the central bank is less
concerned than a few weeks ago that a credit squeeze could derail
the economy. Greenspan's comments were interpreted on Wall Street
to mean the Fed might see less need to cut interest rates again at
its next policy meeting Nov. 17. But Labor Department data,
inadvertently released, reinforced the case for a rate cut and left
economists and investors once again to sort out muddled signals. By

<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ The note was scrawled on a scrap of paper and
thrust at a truck driver for a United States oil company stopped on
a rebel-held highway to the eastern plains of Colombia recently.
``Please do us the favor of coming to talk to us, so we can reach
agreements allowing you to work without problems,'' the note said.
``If you do not come, we will not be responsible for the
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   The company passed the extortion demand, penned in oddly formal,
misspelled Spanish, to Colombian military intelligence. Executives
at the multinational concern, who asked that the company not be
identified, did not give in to insurgents, but ordered their
drivers to skirt the area by taking other roads.
</P>
<P>
   The company could alter its routes and still conduct business,
said Enrique Urrea, head of a committee of security chiefs for U.S.
multinationals operating in Colombia. ``Not everybody can,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   A Colombian soft drink manufacturer, defying similar demands
from the insurgents, saw 54 of its trucks burned. In September, the
rebels kidnapped three of the company's drivers and executed one to
pressure the company. ``If they give up a road, they lose a
market,'' Urrea said. He asked that the company not be named,
saying publicity could endanger the lives of the remaining
hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Though the new government of Andres Pastrana seeks peace talks
with the country's three rebel movements in an effort to end three
decades of civil war, Colombia remains one of the riskiest places
in the world to do business. Threats to foreigners come from random
street crimes, kidnappers, extortion, vandalism and sudden
roadblocks thrown up by rebel factions vying for power.
</P>
<P>
   Half of all the reported kidnappings in the world happen in
Colombia; 806 occurred in the first six months of this year and
1,693 last year, according to the Presidential Anti-Kidnapping
Office. More people are murdered in this nation of 36 million than
in the entire United States, which has nearly eight times the
population. In 1996, the last year for which figures are available,
the Federal Bureau of Investigation reported 19,645 homicides; in
Colombia, there were 26,627.
</P>
<P>
   While the central government holds Bogota and the larger cities,
the countryside is fragmenting into a collection of fiefs
controlled by rebels or by right-wing paramilitaries that terrorize
peasants, often in collusion with army officers and the police.
Foreign businesses are particularly vulnerable to kidnappings and
extortion and kickback demands from the rebels. Security costs,
which average 4 percent of a company's operating costs in the rest
of the developing world, can run up to 10 percent here, security
experts and company executives say.

<P>
   Despite the limitations and risks, a variety of U.S. companies
have opened offices and factories in Colombia, particularly since
the country acted in the early 1990s to lower trade barriers and
otherwise open the economy to foreign investment. They include
Occidental Petroleum, Procter &AMP; Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive, Kellogg,
DuPont and Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
   Some businesses have left, but those that stay in Colombia have
learned to protect their interests. To discourage kidnappings, they
employ Colombian executives and use local contractors. They hire
such multinational security services as Control Risks Group and
Defense Systems Ltd., both based in London; Ackerman Security, and
the Kroll-O'Gara Co., in New York, to tailor security packages for
their executives, installations and trade secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies, sometimes working directly with protection
services, often demand strict security precautions from U.S.
executives in Colombia, said Joseph Finnin, head of the American
Chamber of Commerce here. One insisted that not only an oil company
president but also his wife use bodyguards and armored cars.
</P>
<P>
   The security services also analyze the risks of doing business
with a given Colombian company, perusing court records for
potential legal or tax problems. Earlier this fall, Kroll-O'Gara
bought a factory for making armored cars in Colombia, said Bruce
Goslin, a managing director of the company's office in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Because of security worries, foreigners largely confine
themselves to a small, safe piece of this grimy, bustling city.
They take apartments on the upper floors instead of houses, and
only in the priciest neighborhoods. They vary routes, switching
vehicles and vetting maids, nannies and gardeners with a
thoroughness J. Edgar Hoover might have envied. And they fly,
rather than drive, if they must leave Bogota.

</P>
<P>
   Oil companies pay a special war tax to the government, and they
contract with the Defense Ministry for special army platoons to
protect oil exploration and production sites or dangerous highways.
As threats to their business escalate, foreign companies are
sharing security information and tightening their lines of
communication with Colombia's military intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
   Through the committee that Urrea heads, the chiefs of security
for 65 of the largest companies in Colombia, most of them from the
United States, are in constant contact through beepers that flash
bulletins. Urrea heads security operations for Esso, the Colombian
subsidiary of Exxon. On one recent day, his beeper warned of a
strike by 700,000 civil servants that was paralyzing roads,
telecommunications, hospitals and airports.
</P>
<P>
   The Colombian military sends the committee daily intelligence
reports and other information, while the police provide financial
profiles of potential or actual employees. ``If there's no
information, there's no power,'' Urrea said.
</P>
<P>
   For Armando Lara, a former FBI officer who heads Latin American
operations for Control Risks, that maxim was vividly illustrated a
few years ago. Running late to a meeting with a military commander
in charge of eastern Colombia, Lara flipped on the radio to hear
that the commander had been killed when his car exploded a few
minutes earlier. If Lara had known security was so volatile in the
area, he would have avoided going there, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But more information means maintaining close ties to military
and police forces that have a record of chronic human rights
abuses. According to government investigators and human rights
groups, army and police officers have colluded with the right-wing
paramilitaries, which roam the countryside, terrorizing and
massacring peasants.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the 20th Intelligence Brigade, which supplied
information to every branch of the military, was disbanded, with
numerous officers facing criminal charges of running death squads
and carrying out political assassinations. For more than a year,
the State Department has been combing through the human rights
records of the Colombian army, seeking units with clean records to
receive aid to combat narcotics. But the human rights problems are
so pervasive that only one unit has been cleared, and another had
to be created fresh, culling officers and soldiers with unblemished
records from scattered units.
</P>
<P>
   Urrea said that most security chiefs working in the private
sector are retired military officers like him who have access to
the most senior officers in the Colombian military command.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I know, they are honest, but there are exceptional
cases where a person, in his impotence before the situation we're
living through, commits excesses and violates human rights,'' he
said. `` But that's the exception, not the rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Security chiefs and security firms have also been involved in
negotiating ransoms, which are technically illegal in Colombia. In
a famous case, Control Risks negotiated for the wife of a BASF
chemical company executive. The hostage, Brigitte Schone, was
eventually released when a German spy couple, Werner and Isabel
Mauss, elbowed Control Risks aside and paid rebels a ransom of $1.5
million _ 10 times the amount the company had bargained the ransom
down to. The case set off an international incident when the
Mausses were briefly arrested trying to leave the country with the
freed hostage, using false passports provided by the German
government.
</P>
<P>
   (In the latest illustration of how shadowy are the ties that run
Colombia, the Mausses emerged last summer as behind-the-scenes
figures arranging peace talks in Mainz, Germany, between rebels of
the National Liberation Army, or ELN, and Colombian business and
church representatives.)
</P>
<P>
   It is also illegal to pay extortion in Colombia. Most large U.S.
companies do not surrender to extortion, Lara of Control Risks
said, but added, ``So many have a policy of subcontracting to
Colombian firms, and Colombians feel, especially operating in rural
areas, that they've got to pay to keep themselves safe.''
</P>
<P>
   The most costly threat to foreign businesses has been attacks on
oil pipelines. The attacks have not ceased even as the government
prepares to open talks with the largest insurgent group, the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, in an effort to
end the civil war, which last year claimed 2,183 lives, according
to human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   Nestor Martinez, Interior Minister in the new government,
acknowledged that lack of security is a serious hindrance to doing
business in Colombia. ``Of course, we have problems, like all other
developing countries,'' he said, ``but we're dealing with them, and
we're beginning peace talks with the guerrillas.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the four major American oil companies working here_ Exxon,
Amoco, Chevron and Occidental Petroleum _ perhaps no company has
been more battered by the instability than Occidental. Oxy
Colombia, as the company's local office is known, pumps 160,000
barrels a day of crude from its complex at Cano Limon, near the
Venezuelan border.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, ELN rebels have blown up the pipeline 61
times. Last year, rebels bombed the pipeline 64 times and started
striking closer to home, at the wellheads.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels collect a 10 percent commission from contractors
hired to repair the pipeline and wellheads, said Robert Stewart, a
spokesman for Occidental.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting clobbered,'' he acknowledged. ``It used to be
the guerrillas would do their attacks and run. They're not even
scrambling anymore. Now, they sit around after, have a cup of
coffee and wait for the army to show up.''

   POSOLTEGA, Nicaragua _ Where just a week ago there were fertile
fields of corn, beans and peanuts almost ready for harvest, there
are now only discolored corpses, swelling grotesquely in the
tropical sun. Where the simple thatched houses of peasants have
always stood, all that remains are clusters of ripped and shredded
clothing and a few scattered kitchen utensils.
</P>
<P>
   For Central America, Hurricane Mitch and the floods and
landslides that followed the storm have been a catastrophe, killing
at least 7,000 people and inflicting billions of dollars of damage.
No single place, however, has been harder hit than this collection
of humble agricultural settlements near the Nicaragua-Honduras
border where at least 1,500 people, and perhaps many more, perished
after a series of landslides swept down upon them over a four-day
period ending Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a tragedy beyond measure, beyond our
comprehension,'' said Juan Alberto Munoz Gomez, a
36-year-old-farmer from one of the half-dozen villages that was
obliterated by the stream of mud. ``I thought we were all going to
die, and perhaps it would have been better if we had, for now we
have nothing, not our loved ones, not our houses, not our crops,
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the hurricane, it had been raining incessantly for
nearly a week here, forcing residents of the villages on the flanks
of the Casita Volcano to remain in their houses instead of going
out to investigate conditions. So when the first of the murderous
mudslides announced itself as a loud rumble just before noon Oct.
30, nearly everyone was taken by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, it sounded like a brigade of helicopters was
landing,'' said Fausto Moreira Ruiz, 63. ``But then the noise got
impossibly louder, the ground began to shake, and then, before we
knew it, the mud was on top of us.'' When it was over, he and his
daughter Ofelia, 31, were the only survivors of a family of nine.
</P>
<P>
   When Ana Francisca Sandoval Hernandez and her family heard the
sounds, they ran out to the local baseball field to get a better
view. It was there that they saw a wall of dirt mixed with trees,
rocks and roofs of houses, more than 20 feet high, heading towards
them, with a herd of frantic oxen running in front of the advancing
avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was the end of the world,'' Miss Sandoval, 22,
said from the hospital bed in nearby Chinandega where she is being
treated for injuries caused by the stones, sand and branches that
raked and scraped her body as she was dragged along by the mud flow
for nearly two hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst part now, especially at night or when there's a lot
of fog, is the fear that it is going to happen again,'' said
Ernesto Juarez, a farm worker in the settlement of Calle Real del
Bosque. ``All it takes is just a bit of rumbling, and people rush
out of their houses and begin running around every which way.''
</P>
<P>
   From the air, it looks as if a giant hand had descended from the
top of the volcano, its coffee-colored fingers clawing and gouging
their way indiscriminately across fields, streams, settlements and
highways.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those caught in the avalanche were buried alive as they
tried to outrun the mudflow, and will remain interred in unmarked
graves, but others were merely immobilized, trapped up to their
waists or shoulders and left to worry that the next wave would bury
them too.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``All night long, I could hear people yelling for help,'' said
Miguel Angel Cama Valdivia, 28, a farmworker from El Porvenir who
said he ran for three miles before the mud overtook him. ``And I
was crying out, too. I might still be there if a boy hadn't come
along and pulled me out of the mud.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelvin Madariaga Gonzalez, 11, survived the onslaught only by
taking refuge on an oxcart that had wound up lodged on top of a
tree. The boy, severely bruised, was eventually evacuated to a
hospital where he was reunited with an older brother, Humberto, 20,
but Kelvin still does not know what happened to his parents and
8-year-old twin brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are all in the other hospital,'' he said
hesitantly. ``That is what my brother told me.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the magnitude of personal loss the survivors have
suffered is so overwhelming as to stagger the imagination.
Francisco Javier Sandoval, for instance, counts 47 relatives who
were swept away and still have not been accounted for: ``uncles and
aunts, brothers, cousins, nephews and nieces, family members of all
sizes and ages,'' he said with anguish in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   Others are still struggling to accept what has happened. ``I
went up there again today looking for my wife, my children, my
brothers, my mother-in-law, and my brothers-in-law,'' said Felix
Pedro Caballero, a 26-year-old farmer. ``But I didn't find them.
All I found was a pair of pants belonging to my brother. But I'm
going to keep going back until I find them, dead or alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Relief workers say the odds are that Caballero's search, like
that of thousands of others whose relatives are still missing, will
never be satisfied. With so many decaying corpses strewn about the
landscape, health workers have abandoned hope of identifying and
burying the dead, and are now merely collecting bodies and burning
them en masse.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, peasants in remote areas are simply gathering
bodies and burying them in common graves without bothering to
report their actions to the authorities. ``My sons alone have
buried 40 or 50,'' said Maria Lourdes Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Another round of heavy rains Wednesday night only made the
situation worse. The downpour swept dozens of corpses down the
mountainside and into gullies, adding to the threat of epidemics by
contaminating drinking water, and making it easier for ravenous
pigs and dogs to feast on the flesh.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

<P>
   On Thursday morning, the decomposing, grayish-yellow bodies of a
half-dozen victims still lay in a sugarcane field just north of
Calle Real del Bosque. Some were adults, others were children; all
had been stripped of their clothing and any possible identifying
documents by the tremendous force of the mudslides, and most lay on
their backs, their mouths open and their arms stiffly extended as
if they had been swimming
</P>
<P>
   ``It is painful to say this, because we are Nicaraguans, and
these are our countrymen,'' said Jose Perez Aviles, a Ministry of
Health inspector who was leading a team equipped with cans of
diesel gasoline and rubber tires to dispose of the corpses. ``The
dead who are already buried are going to have to be left in place,
and the others are going to have to be incinerated because they are
a risk to the health of survivors.''
</P>
<P>
   By those macabre standards, Isaias Vasquez Santeliz has to be
counted as one of the lucky ones. The 12-year-old boy survived the
mudslide and was hospitalized over the weekend, but could not stave
off infections in the wounds he suffered when he was carried by and
trapped in the mud.
</P>
<P>
   So on Wednesday afternoon, his grandparents, uncles and aunts
wrapped his body in a blue tarpaulin and a white lace tablecloth
and placed him in a simple gray coffin that was hoisted onto a
flatbed truck. As a tractor led a procession to the cemetery here,
relatives and townspeople walked behind or rode on bicycles,
thankful that at least one child could be properly buried.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were six in that family, and now only one remains,
Isaac, the youngest son of my only daughter,'' the boy's
grandmother, Candida Morales Delgado, said tearfully as the casket
was lowered into the ground. ``We will care for him as best we can
because he is all that we have left.''

ANTISEMITISM SPREADING IN SWITZERLAND, GOVERNMENT STUDY SAYS   
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH OLSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Anti-Semitism has spread in Switzerland in reaction to
the recent scrutiny of the country's wartime actions, a government
commission said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A yearlong s4udy found that inhibitions against the open
expression of racist views had been swept away during the
controversy over Switzerland's responsibility to compensate
Holocaust victims for assets lost during World War II. The
controversy broadened into a wide-ranging examination of
Switzerland's role in the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Swiss believed that they were different, that they didn't
have dirty hands, that they were specially protected against all
that happened around them,'' said Doris Angst Yilmaz, the
commission's secretary general. ``This study showed that we are
like our neighbors. We are not special or different, even in
anti-Semitism.''
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss Jewish Federation said the finding ``shows there is a
significant need in Switzerland to improve education so that there
is better knowledge of, and communication with, the Jewish
minority.'' Of the seven million people living in Switzerland,
about 17,500 are Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Although prejudice has existed in Switzerland for centuries, the
most famous example occurred in 1938, when Switzerland asked
Germany and Austria to stamp a ``J'' on the passports of Jews, a
practice used to identify them in order to bar their entry into
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that prejudice against Jews is not organized
and is seldom linked to right-wing extremism.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find anti-Semitism here in daily life, not in organized
demonstrations,'' said Prof. Georg Kreis, a Basel University
history professor who specializes in World War II and who led the
study. ``It is not confined only to one class, but exists
throughout society.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``political crisis concerning Switzerland's self-image'' and
a recent economic downturn combined to bring anti-Jewish feeling
into the open, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latent anti-Semitism is again being increasingly expressed in
public by word and by deed,'' the report said. ``There often
emerges a dangerous differentiation between `the Swiss' and `the
Jews.'''
</P>
<P>
   `` `The Jews' were the villains and `the Swiss' were the
victims,'' Mrs. Yilmaz summed up.
</P>
<P>
   The study was undertaken after Jean Pascal Delamuraz, then the
Swiss President, in provocative remarks in December 1996, labeled
Jewish demands for compensation ``blackmail.''
</P>
<P>
   His remarks helped make Jewish stereotypes acceptable and
anti-Semitic sentiment burst into public view, the report said. He
later apologized, but the report said his view was supported by a
large number of Swiss, as shown in letters to newspapers, remarks
in the media and comments in markets and other public places.
Jewish groups and prominent individuals began receiving threatening
letters.
</P>
<P>
   Although the commission completed its report prior to the
agreement in August by Switzerland's largest banks to pay $1.25
billion to Holocaust survivors, the report warned that the deal
``may arouse new signs of anti- Semitism in Switzerland.''
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland signed international human rights accords in 1994,
and later 55 percent of the Swiss voters approved anti-racism laws,
similar to those in France and Germany, that forbid disparaging the
Holocaust. In 1995 the Federal Commission against Racism was
established.
</P>
<P>
   The report said this legislation ended Switzerland's position as
``a hub for slanderous anti-Semitic and `negationist' material in
Europe,'' a role that had grown because the country lacked legal
barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Yilmaz said there are about 100 bias cases currently in
Swiss courts, with 55 involving charges of anti-Semitism.

VOTE ENCOURAGES MODERATES WITH EYE ON PRESIDENTIAL RUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The perception that moderates triumphed in the 1998
election is already having a significant impact on the 2000
presidential campaign, with some likely Republican candidates
positioning themselves as centrists who will focus on education and
other family issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic field, meanwhile, could be shaken up if House
Minority Leader Richard Gephardt interprets the election as a sign
that Democrats might take control of the House in 2000 and make him
speaker, decreasing the chance he would seek the presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Now the race for message and money begins in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican tone for 2000 may have been set by newly
reelected Texas Governor George W. Bush, who said in his victory
speech that he has shown a Republican can be both conservative and
compassionate. Bush, considered the GOP front-runner for the White
House, also demonstrated he can pull in Hispanic votes, which is
important in a presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush plans to take his time before announcing whether he
will run for president, other prospects are all but declared. Just
hours after the polls closed on Election Day, likely GOP candidate
Lamar Alexander began running what might be considered the first
2000 campaign television ads, hitting the airwaves in 14 states
with commercials that touted his new agenda called ``We The
Parents.'' In an interview Thursday, Alexander sounded as moderate
as ever, vowing not to be ``pulled to the right by the party
caucus'' and saying he talks about abortion only when asked.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge, a Republican who romped to
reelection on Tuesday, said in an interview that the party needs to
``soften the edge a little bit'' and focus more on the way
Republican governors solve ``real world problems.'' Indeed, the
selection Thursday of Philadelphia as the site of the GOP
convention in 2000 is viewed by some as a reaction to this week's
vote, handing the prize to a region where Republicans are more
moderate.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the 1998 election may have ended the
presidential prospects of House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who many GOP
members hold responsible for developing the ads reminding voters of
the Clinton sex scandal that played so poorly in the last weeks of
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Not all Republicans received the same moderate message from the
election, however. Publisher Steve Forbes and conservative activist
Gary Bauer, who are both eyeing the Republican nomination, said the
GOP lost seats in the House because the party strayed from its
conservative roots and did not insist on tax cuts. Indeed, if
Gingrich faces a challenge for the speakership, it could be from a
conservative, not a moderate, lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, meanwhile, Vice President Al Gore
emerged as a winner because he campaigned hard for many candidates
who won and who might remain loyal to him. Moreover, following an
election that was seen as a vindication for the White House,
President Clinton plans to transfer increasing responsibility and
visibility to Gore to help the Tennessean run for president.
</P>
<P>
   As for Gephardt, spokesman Eric Smith said the Missourian has
been asked numerous times whether Tuesday's vote would prompt him
to reconsider a run for president. But Gephardt ``hasn't taken the
bait yet'' on the question, Smith said. ``He is thinking about
planning ahead for the 2000 congressional races,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democratic prospects include Senator John F. Kerry of
Massachusetts, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska and former Senator
Bill Bradley of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Even the surprise victory of former professional wrestler and
Reform Party candidate Jesse Ventura as Minnesota governor
contained a message for presidential aspirants. If voters across
the country are looking for a fresh, no-nonsense voice, as happened
in Minnesota, then a third-party candidate for president may emerge
in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   While the presidential election is two years away, most analysts
think the campaign started as soon as the polls closed. Candidates
need to raise enormous sums of money faster than usual because the
upcoming presidential campaign features an early series of
primaries in February and March, prompting some experts to suggest
the race might be over three weeks after the first vote in the Iowa
caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts predict that serious candidates will need to raise
about $20 million each in 1999 to prepare for the primaries,
something only a handful of people can accomplish. Alexander, for
example, thinks only four Republicans can raise that much money:
himself, the multimillionaire Forbes, Bush and perhaps one other
candidate who hasn't yet emerged as a top contender.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible Republican candidate, Senator John McCain of
Arizona, said in a recent interview that the difficulty of raising
so much money is daunting even for him. McCain told the Arizona
Republic, that he would rather ``bang my head up against the wall''
than try to raise the necessary $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Some prospective candidates are already running quasi-campaigns,
but without the usual fund-raising limits. Alexander, for example,
has set up several political action committees that are allowed to
receive unlimited contributions for ``issue ads'' to promote
Alexander and his agenda. Alexander said he has raised $5 million
this year through his various committees, including $2 million for
the ``We the Parents'' ads airing this week. Forbes, meanwhile,
raised millions of dollars for a non-profit company that runs ads
across the country touting his agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander exemplifies how Tuesday's results might affect the
2000 campaign. The former Education secretary no longer talks about
eliminating the Education Department, which was a poorly received
idea in 1996 and could be even more unpopular now since polls show
that education is one of the top concerns among voters. Instead, he
talks about improving schools, cutting taxes and ``cleaning up the
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, my message has more appeal to the center and the
right than the far right,'' Alexander said. While Alexander opposes
abortion, ``it is not a subject I bring up. I talk about it when I
am asked about it. It is not usually in my speeches.'' Bush,
similarly, opposes abortion but has said: ``The United States
Supreme Court has settled the abortion issue. There will be
abortion in Texas and the rest of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, a formidable contender because of his wealth, wrote a
memo Wednesday to Republicans that castigated the party for running
without a message. Forbes said in an interview that the party lost
because it gave up on an agenda of tax cuts and had a message of
``mush.'' Forbes, asked whether he plans to moderate his views in
light of the election, said he would run on a ``broad agenda'' that
appeals to all factions of the party.
</P>
<P>
   Still, drawing a conclusion from 1998 on how to run in 2000
could be politically hazardous. After all, Republicans picked up 52
House seats in 1994 by emphasizing their Contract with America. Bob
Dole picked up the theme two years later in the presidential race _
only to lose to Clinton.

   &UR; FOR SUNDAY, NOV. 8 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times News Service will send the following Money
and Business articles for release Sunday, Nov. 8, 1998:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ON THE SECTION FRONT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   EXECUTIVE-PAY (Undated) _ Has executive pay gotten completely
out of hand? An examination of the interplay of chief executives,
compensation committees of boards of directors and consultants who
help set pay levels calls into question whether ``pay for
performance,'' a mantra that companies have used for two decades to
explain their strategy for setting pay, accurately describes what
is happening behind closed boardroom doors. Through an elaborate
process that is fraught with conflicts of interest and marred by
questionable assumptions, executive pay is often set with methods
imported from Lake Wobegon, the place where Garrison Keillor
imagines that ``all children are above average.'' By Adam Bryant.

<P>
   COMPANIES-SOFTWARE (Undated) _ They call it corporate root
canal: Installing enterprise software, the monster
run-the-whole-show software packages made by SAP, Baan, PeopleSoft
and others that promise to boost efficiency, provide much better
management information and control and slash costs, can turn the
whole company painfully upside-down to get there. We get inside
three companies at different stages of the years-long process. By
Claudia H. Deutsch. (With Graphic and Photo.)

   BIZ-TELECOMS (Undated) _ When the bull market pooped out this
fall, a whole generation of telecomm startups were left in a tight
spot. Their business plans were predicated on getting big
injections of new capital around now through secondary equity
offerings, to pay the huge capital costs of getting going in the
phone business. With new equity now a non-starter for all but the
biggest, safest companies, the phone newbies have had to scramble
to find a plan B. We say what they are up to, and list about 8 that
have found alternative money in the past couple of weeks. By Seth

WOODWARD LAWYERS SEEK REVIEW OF DAMAGE ISSUE IN CIVIL SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Lawyers for British au pair Louise Woodward concede
that she is responsible for the death of eight-month-old Matthew
Eappen, but they are challenging the scope of the damages that can
be paid to his parents.
</P>
<P>
   After ignoring the wrongful death suit brought against Woodward
for more than four months, her newly-hired lawyers succeeded
Thursday in convincing a federal judge to reconsider the damages
issue.
</P>
<P>
   The &UR;  &LR; end result could be that a jury, not a judge, decides just
how much money the Eappens should get.
</P>
<P>
   US District Judge William G. Young said he would permit
Woodward's new lawyers, John P. Ryan and Myles W. McDonough, to
argue at a hearing Nov. 19 that the Eappens are not entitled to
punitive damages from Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Woodward's lawyers said they were ``tabling''
a request that Young lift the injunction barring Woodward from
spending any money she gets from selling her story.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that his firm's appearance in the case was
``11th hour,'' Ryan said Woodward did not become aware of
``possible alternative sources to help her defend herself in the
United States'' until late September.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan would not be more specific, but made references in court to
``carriers,'' presumably meaning insurance carriers. And his firm,
Sloane and Walsh, is known for its insurance defense work.
</P>
<P>
   But Ryan said his firm ``is not the insurance counsel...We're
representing Miss Woodward.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for EF Au Pair, the agency that spent $750,000
defending Woodward in her criminal trial, referred questions about
EF's involvement in the case to attorney Norman Jacobs of the
Boston law firm of Esdaile Barrett &AMP; Esdaile, saying ``it's not an
EF issue, it's an insurance issue.'' Jacobs did not return a phone
message seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, Ryan insisted that Woodward did not want the
injunction lifted that prohibits her from profiting from her story
so that she can be free to make money.
</P>
<P>
   ``This hearing was not for the purpose of releasing Miss
Woodward to go out and sell a story and profit, which is the way
I've seen this characterized, and I think that's regrettable,''
Ryan said. ``She has a right to be heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Both inside and outside the courtroom, the Eappens' lawyer,
Fredric L. Ellis, angrily challenged Woodward's claim that she had
no financial means to defend the lawsuit until recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason why the court should bend over backwards to
give her any relief at this point,'' Ellis said afterward. He told
Young he wanted to see an affidavit from Woodward swearing that she
had no money in July, when Young entered a default judgment because
Woodward had not responded to the suit in any way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe it,'' Ellis said, noting that Woodward got
$60,000 from a British tabloid, had money in her defense fund and
bought a new car. ``She could have used that for her defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue before Young in two weeks will be whether the Eappens
are entitled to punitive damages in addition to compensatory
damages. Woodward's lawyers say they are not, based on Middlesex
Superior Court Judge Hiller Zobel's finding in November 1997 that
Woodward acted out of ``confusion, fright and bad judgment, rather
than rage or malice'' when she fatally shook Matthew Eappen.
</P>
<P>
   To award punitive damages on top of compensatory damages, there
must be evidence of ``willful, wanton or reckless conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's lawyers said they wanted a full evidentiary hearing
on their claim that Woodward's conduct was not reckless, which
would require testimony. If that were the case, Ellis said, ``I'd
prefer to have a jury sitting in that box while we do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said he was not reluctant to go to trial. ``There is no
issue of liability,'' he said. ``The issue is how much the damages
are going to be. If he removes the default judgment we'll have a
jury determine that instead of a judge.''

ART NOTES: CHANGES AT THE WHITNEY; PRUNING A PRIVATE COLLECTION;
MUSEUM AT SKIDMORE COLLEGE; DIA CHAIRMAN; GRANT-SELWYN EXPANDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Maxwell Anderson, director of the Whitney Museum
of American Art, announced last week that he was reorganizing the
staff to assign specialized areas to specific curators, he omitted
the names of two of the museum's top curators, Thelma Golden and
Elisabeth Sussman.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Golden, a 10-year Whitney veteran, organized the current Bob
Thompson exhibition. Ms. Sussman, who has been at the museum for
seven years, supervised the 1993 Biennial, ``Florine Stettheimer''
in 1995 and last year's Keith Haring retrospective.
</P>
<P>
   This week, both women resigned from the museum. A Whitney
spokeswoman said they declined to comment on their departures.
</P>
<P>
   But Anderson had a lot to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to make some tough choices, and there were only so many
curators who could have lead positions,'' he said. ``Both Thelma
and Elisabeth felt they could not contribute as much to the
institution as they wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Golden was to have been in charge of the next Biennial.
Anderson said that he had offered her the Biennial assignment as a
part-time job, but that she had declined. He added that he and Lisa
Phillips, the Whitney's contemporary-art curator, would decide on
Ms. Golden's replacement for the Biennial.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sussman's resignation leaves the Whitney in a bind. She has
been organizing two major exhibitions: one on the photographer
Diane Arbus, the other on the Minimalist artist Eva Hesse. Ms.
Sussman has been working closely with the artists' estates, and a
Whitney spokeswoman confirmed that Ms. Sussman was planning to take
the exhibitions with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elisabeth and I are having fresh conversations about the
shows,'' Anderson said. ``If we are offered them, we'd like to have
them. But it's her intellectual property.'' He said he realized
that the exhibitions might go to competing museums.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is also planning to eliminate some jobs at the museum,
he said. One is that of the associate curator for film and video, a
post held by Matthew Yokobosky, who has worked at the Whitney since
1987. Yokobosky has agreed to stay on as a consulting curator,
helping the museum put together its giant show ``The American
Century: Art and Culture 1900-2000,'' which opens in April.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there are also two job openings for curators: one for
postwar art, defined as that from 1951 to 1989, the other for
photography.
</P>
<P>
   Saluting the Flag
</P>
<P>
   Even relatively new art collectors like Stephen Wynn, chairman
of Mirage Resorts, refine their collections periodically.
</P>
<P>
   Only weeks after he opened the Bellagio, his new Las Vegas,
Nev., resort that features a mini-museum filled with $285 million
worth of art by masters, including Picasso, de Kooning and
Lichtenstein, Wynn has privately sold about $30 million worth of
art.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Mnuchin, chairman of C&AMP;M Arts, the Madison Avenue
gallery, bought Jasper Johns' ``Flag on Orange Field II'' (1958)
from Wynn. Mnuchin declined to say what he paid for the Johns, but
experts in the field said they thought it cost him about $13
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a painting I've always loved, and I was thrilled to have
the opportunity to buy it,'' Mnuchin said.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn also sold two works to William Acquavella, the dealer who
is also his art adviser. The pieces are Brancusi's ``Mademoiselle
Pogany II,'' a portrait of a Hungarian student from 1920-25 that
Wynn bought at Christie's in New York in May 1997 for $7 million,
and Giacometti's ``Pointing Man,'' which he bought privately
several years ago. Acquavella confirmed the purchases, saying he
had bought the pieces for stock.
</P>
<P>
   Wynn was traveling, his office said, and could not be reached
for comment. Experts say he is trying to raise money to buy works
at Sotheby's and Christie's Impressionist, modern and contemporary
auctions later this month, among them a van Gogh self-portrait,
which carries a $20 million to $25 million price tag.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Big Museum on Campus
</P>
<P>
   Saratoga Springs, N.Y., is getting its first art museum. The
Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery, a $10 million project being
built on the Skidmore College campus, will be an interdisciplinary
arts center housed in a 34,000-square-foot building designed by
Antoine Predock, the Albuquerque, N.M., architect. Groundbreaking
is scheduled for the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a college museum that engages various disciplines
on campus,'' said Charles Stainback, who began as the new museum's
director a year ago after having been a curator at the
International Center for Photography in Manhattan for 13 years.
``It will be a hybrid between a Kunsthalle and an exploratorium.
This is quite adventurous for this small college.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum will have a 150-seat auditorium, classrooms, gallery
spaces that accommodate several temporary exhibitions at the same
time, and storage for the college's permanent collection of about
7,000 works that include 20th-century and Pre-Columbian art as well
as works on paper.
</P>
<P>
   The first show will be ``S.O.S./Scenes of Sound,'' which will
include sculptures and multimedia installations in which sound is
the primary component, and artworks whose theme is sound.
</P>
<P>
   The museum has been named in honor of Frances Young Tang, a
member of Skidmore's class of 1961 who died in 1992. Her husband,
Oscar Tang, a financier, has been one of the project's principal
benefactors. Tang is a trustee of the the Metropolitan Museum of
Art and a major supporter to the Met's new Chinese galleries, which
opened in May.
</P>
<P>
   New DIA Chairman
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Dia Center for the Arts announced this week that
Charles Wright was stepping down as chairman after three years.
Wright, who will remain a board member, is being replaced by
Leonard Riggio, chief executive of Barnes &AMP; Noble. Riggio, a
collector, gave Dia a group of three monumental steel works by
Richard Serra last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Tenenbaum, who has been on Dia's board for three years, will
become the vice chairwoman.
</P>
<P>
   Opening Coast-to-Coast
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York branch of Grant Selwyn Fine Art, a new
gallery formed by Anthony Grant and Marc Selwyn, is scheduled to
open on Nov. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Grant and Selwyn, major contemporary-art collectors, both
started out at Sotheby's and then migrated to Pace Wildenstein,
Grant working out of New York, and Selwyn from Los Angeles. In
March, they resigned to open their own gallery, with offices in New
York and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan branch, 3,000 square feet at 37 West 57th Street,
was designed by Michael Gabellini, the Manhattan architect who is
redesigning the facade for Rockefeller Center. The gallery's first
show will be a group exhibition of sculptures and related drawings
by David Smith, Donald Judd, Richard Serra, Sol LeWitt, Richard
Tuttle and others.
</P>
<P>
   Grant Selwyn's other gallery will open on Canon Drive in Beverly
Hills, Calif., in January. It is being designed by Fred Fisher, the
architect for the renovated P.S. 1 in Long Island City, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to focus on masterworks from the secondary
market,'' Grant said. ``But eventually we plan to begin
representing artists.''

KOPP LONG INVOLVED IN ANTI-ABORTION ACTIVITY, STEPMOTHER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Calif., Del., Texas)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT   AND BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURLINGTON, Vt. _ More than a decade before the shooting death
of an abortion doctor in New York, the man wanted for questioning
in connection with the murder launched a wandering anti-abortion
crusade across the country, protesting outside clinics from Florida
to Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   James Charles Kopp became well established in the ``radical
fringe,'' observers say, bearing an apocalyptic nickname and
accumulating a long rap sheet. And if he seemed unusually committed
to the movement, his stepmother said, it was from personal
experience: in 1982, she said, his fiancee aborted her pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was upset because it was his child, and he was not
consulted,'' said his stepmother Emaline Kopp, 60, from her home in
Irving, Tex. ``It just broke him. When he found out about it, it
just flipped him out.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the FBI issued a material-witness warrant for
Kopp, based on reports his car was seen near the upstate New York
home of Dr. Barnett Slepian. &UR;  &LR; The doctor was shot by a sniper Oct.
23 in the fifth such shooting in the United States and Canada in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have repeatedly insisted that Kopp, 44, is not a
suspect.
</P>
<P>
   In the opinions of acquaintances and relatives, Kopp is deeply
involved with the anti-abortion movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just worked menial jobs to support himself so he could
travel around and do this work,'' his stepmother said. ``We were
disappointed in him'' for his lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Kopp was raised in California, one of five children born to
Charles Kopp, a business attorney, and his wife, Nancy, a
registered nurse. After spending his teenage years as a member of
the high school band and an Eagle Scout, his stepmother said, he
went on to the University of California at Santa Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; It was in college that he met his future fiancee, whom his
stepmother recalled only by her first name, Jennifer.
</P>
<P>
   She said the couple moved to Texas to attend the state
university for graduate school, with Kopp studying marine biology,
she said. Sometime in 1982, Jennifer became pregnant; when she
ended the relationship and had an abortion, his stepmother said,
Kopp ``snapped.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a couple of years, he had decided to change his faith
from Lutheran to Catholic, and talked endlessly with his parents
about his revulsion toward abortion, Emaline Kopp said.
</P>
<P>
   And soon, he had volunteered with the pro-life group Operation
Rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most (Operation Rescue members) describe him as a loner, a
hermit, who got involved back in the early '80s,'' said Judy L.
Thomas, a reporter with the Kansas City Star and author of ``Wrath
of Angels,'' a book about the anti-abortion wars. ``He actually
even worked in the Operation Rescue headquarters in Binghampton,
New York for awhile.''
</P>
<P>
   In the decade that followed, Kopp became infamous within the
anti-abortion world as a soft-spoken but deeply committed crusader
with a high tolerance for jail time.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested repeatedly for violations outside clinics across
the country: in 1986 in Pensacola, Fla., in Atlanta two years
later, in Houston and in Levittown, N.Y., in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was arrested everywhere,'' Emaline Kopp said.
</P>
<P>
   And on March 20, 1990 _ at a time when observers believe Kopp
had abandoned Operation Rescue in favor of the more militant Lambs
of Christ _ he was one of 12 people arrested during a protest
outside the Vermont Women's Health Center in Burlington, according
to court records.
</P>
<P>
   The incident revealed both his religious devotion and
anti-abortion zeal.
</P>
<P>
   In that demonstration, protesters chained themselves with
``Kryptonite'' bicycle locks to an unregistered car they had parked
in the driveway, according to court records. Kopp was held on a
trespassing charge for 51 days without bail, primarily because he
refused to identify himself to the Chittenden County court _
instead referring to himself as ``Baby John Doe.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 6, 1990, Kopp wrote in an affidavit seeking to remove
the judge from the case: ``My jury and/or judge must hear, to rule
fairly, my evidence about FORCED ABORTIONS being performed in the
mill. I refuse to be stifled when talking about Jesus, His babies,
and the justification defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Kopp's sister, Anne Rodgers of Newark, Del., said Thursday that
her brother is a disciple of peaceful protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim is against violence,'' she said from her home, where she
runs a day-care center. ``His only arrests have been while
participating in peaceful prolife demonstrations -- similar to the
Martin Luther King model.''
</P>
<P>
   In reports published Thursday, Rodgers also offered a different
explanation for her brother's anti-abortion beliefs than his
stepmother described, saying he ``realized, gosh, around 1978 that
people were lying when they were saying it was a group of tissue
and it wasn't a human being.''
</P>

   Kopp also discovered he could not thrive in long-term
relationships, Rodgers told the Burlington Free Press. ``He
realized he couldn't devote himself to a wife the way he wanted
to,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators, meanwhile, said they were reviving an abortion
violence task force that was initially launched in 1995 to
investigate whether there were a conspiracy behind several clinic
attacks. Associate Attorney General Ray Fisher said Thursday that
the Department of Justice is ``heavily engaged in developing a new
plan'' to build on the previous task force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have gained new information,'' Fisher said. ``We think we
have a material witness that we are hopeful of bringing in so we
can question him and get more information. ... So all of that, we
hope, will bring an end to these threats.''

SECURITY COUNCIL UNITES TO MAKE DEMANDS OF IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The Security Council voted unanimously Thursday
to condemn Iraq and demand that President Saddam Hussein rescind
his ban on cooperation with United Nations arms inspectors. But the
council stopped short of authorizing or even mentioning the use of
force to back its demand.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution, making formal the outrage first expressed by
council members on Saturday after Iraq effectively shut down the
arms monitoring system, comes amid reports that the United States
may be preparing for military action against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials argue that they already have ample authority to
attack Iraq under previous resolutions, and Thursday the Clinton
administration moved ahead with preparations for air strikes,
administration and Western officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Several council members, however, warned against that course.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's representative, Sergey Lavrov, who said that his
government had been lobbying Iraq to change its policy, added that
the only way out of the impasse was through diplomatic and
political means. Nothing in Thursday's measure ``could be
interpreted arbitrarily as a kind of permission to use force,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any attempt to resolve the problem by using force,'' Lavrov
went on, ``would entail highly unpredictable and dangerous
consequences both for the capacity of the United Nations to
continue to monitor proscribed military activities in Iraq and for
peace and stability in the region and in the Middle East as a
whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's representative, Celso Luiz Nunes Amorim, said in an
interview on Wednesday that there was a sense among a number of
council members that Iraq's noncompliance was not enough to provoke
military action. ``If they did some physical damage or expelled
everybody, that would be different,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday the Brazilian and Russian representatives joined a
stream of speakers expressing frustration and anger over Saddam's
seemingly self-destructive move, given the diplomatic strides Iraq
made earlier in the year. Several diplomats speculated that the
Iraqi President may be more out of touch or under strain than
outsiders thought.
</P>
<P>
   For a year Iraq has been stepping up pressure for the lifting of
sanctions imposed after its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, and
the council repeatedly said this would not happen until Baghdad
answered all outstanding questions on its weapons programs. Last
week the Iraqi leadership said it had run out of patience.
</P>
<P>
   Alain Dejammet, the French representative, said that ``progress
toward lifting sanctions from which the Iraqi people are suffering
is for Iraq to rescind without delay the unjustifiable measures of
Oct. 31.''
</P>
<P>
   France withdrew its charge d'affaires from Baghdad on Thursday
to protest the Iraqi bans.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq first cut back cooperation with arms inspectors on Aug. 5,
then said on Oct. 31 that it would end all dealings with the U.N.
Special Commission, known as Unscom, while allowing the
International Atomic Energy Agency to continue some of its work.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Unscom officials reviewed the status of their staff
in Baghdad, where only maintenance work on monitoring equipment has
been permitted. Charles Duelfer, deputy executive chairman of the
commission, said in an interview that perhaps up to 20 of about 120
people might be withdrawn over the next few days. They would
include a visiting team sent to observe Iraqi missile tests and
some members of regular monitoring teams who are not needed since
inspection and monitoring activities have been frozen.
</P>
<P>
   The American threat is being taken seriously among Arab leaders,
who have urged Baghdad to rethink its harsh stand against
inspections. A letter from the Arab League to Iraq's deputy prime
minister, Tariq Aziz, Saddam's spokesman on the inspection issue,
urged the Iraqis to adopt a ``flexible'' position, the league's
representative at the United Nations said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very concerned about an escalation and the use of force
to settle this problem,'' said the envoy, Hussein Hassouna. ``It
would be better to negotiate, to convince the Iraqis to
cooperate.'' Hassouna said that Arab nations feared that the whole
region could be unsettled by another battering of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The resolution adopted Thursday restates the council's support
for the special commission, which has been under constant attack by
the Iraqi leadership. Iraq wants it restructured and its chairman,
Richard Butler, replaced. But there has been little or no
discussion in a week of debate about how to insure that meaningful
inspections will take place again if and when Iraq lifts its ban.
</P>
<P>
   Arms experts, looking back over months of confrontations with
Iraq, including another threat of U.S. military action almost a
year ago, have watched the U.N. Special Commission, the panel
created not only to disarm Iraq but also to prevent it from
rearming, get whittled down further with each crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the inspectors back to work, experts say, will mean more
than returning to the status quo before August, when spot
inspections were barred. The commission will have to be
strengthened, experts say, but they and some members of the council
add that this does not appear to be high on the American agenda.
</P>
<P>
   American diplomats here say that U.S. policy has not changed,
but comments in recent months from administration officials in
Washington reflect a preference for maintaining tight sanctions on
Iraq with the unified backing of the Security Council rather than
risking a rupture of that common front by forcing more intrusive
policing of Iraqi arms programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``No inspections _ and sanctions _ is much worse than full
inspections and diminished sanctions,'' said David Albright,
president of the independent Institute for Science and
International Security in Washington and a former inspector in Iraq
for the International Atomic Energy Agency. ``My sense is that the
U.S. government thinks that sanctions alone can do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright echoed other experts in saying that the atomic energy
agency, which watches nuclear developments, and Unscom, which is
responsible for checking on biological, chemical and missile
programs, are at the critical juncture between disarming Iraq and
setting up a system of long-term monitoring to prevent President
Hussein from rearming.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, France and China have been pushing for a quicker
transition from active, unannounced on-site inspections in Iraq to
less intrusive long-term monitoring, which would accompany the
lifting of the oil embargo, but not other sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   But arms experts, noting Iraq's recent stepped-up interference
with monitoring activities and Baghdad's demands that no more
on-the-spot inspections be used to back them up, say the value of
remote inspection systems _ 135 video cameras in 20 locations and
air, soil and water sensors and sniffers _ seems to have diminished
considerably, if it ever was as comprehensive as asserted.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Ritter, an American specialist in Iraqi concealment
methods who resigned from Unscom in August to protest what he
called the Clinton administration's and Secretary-General Kofi
Annan's willingness to muzzle inspectors, called the monitoring
system ``a joke'' in an interview on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Camera monitoring is an empty shell,'' he said, explaining
that there had been a debate within the commission under Butler's
predecessor, Rolf Ekeus, about where to best place the cameras.
Ritter said he and others had argued for cameras at ``choke points
that had easily identifiable signatures,'' like missile sites.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the cameras were instead placed haphazardly and
hurriedly in stationary positions in storage areas or production
plants, some watching machine tools, to the consternation of other
American experts, he said. Iraq has learned how to work around
them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States Department of Energy itself put out a video
on how easy it is to spoof cameras,'' he said.

BUILDINGS THAT SERVE AND THAT ARE SERVED 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By SARAH BOXER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The architect Louis Kahn had a radical idea about the
relationship between ``servant'' spaces and spaces that are
``served.'' According to Thomas H. Garver, an art curator who wrote
the introduction to the book ``Invisible New York,'' Kahn wanted
not only to make sure each kind of space was clearly articulated
but also to raise the status of ``servant'' spaces. A furnace room
should get as much consideration as a lobby.
</P>
<P>
   This is a helpful thing to keep in mind when comparing the work
of two very different photographers of architecture: Julius Shulman
(at the Yancey Richardson Gallery) and Stanley Greenberg (at the
Municipal Art Society and at Yancey Richardson).
</P>
<P>
   Shulman is known for his knockout black-and white pictures of
Art Deco movie theaters designed by S. Charles Lee and modernist
buildings by Richard Neutra, Frank Lloyd Wright and Philip Johnson.
Greenberg is known for his dank-looking black-and-white pictures of
catwalks, tunnels, reservoir gatehouses and power stations: places
where, as Garver puts it, ``the services essential to modern urban
life are created, harnessed and directed.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Shulman's photographs were taken above ground in Los
Angeles. Most of Greenberg's were taken underground in New York.
Shulman photographs buildings that are served; Greenberg, buildings
that serve.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally there are differences. One of Greenberg's most
memorable shots is down the spiral stairway of the reservoir
gatehouse under Central Park. The whole thing looks like the
aperture of a camera shutting down. At the center is a wall with
pipes and switches. The stairway swirls into that dark mechanical
vortex, its wrought-iron steps allowing specks of light to filter
through. There is no question that this is a ``servant'' space.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast this with Shulman's photographs of Art Deco movie
theaters in Los Angeles in the 1940s. A picture of the Vern Theater
at night shows the word Vern in lights, a delicate gem at the top
of a curving marquee.
</P>
<P>
   The theater is showing ``Meet John Doe.'' A picture of the
Academy Theater shows the building's white column rising
dramatically up through the roof, as a spiral ledge runs around it
catching each letter: A-C-A-D-E-M-Y. The spiral has no function
except to play with the name of the theater. ``Smith Goes to
Washington'' is on the marquee. Clearly these are photographs of
architectural confections, pictures of places where ordinary people
escape for vicarious adventures.
</P>
<P>
   For all the differences, though, there are overlaps. Formally,
Shulman's photograph of the Guggenheim Museum's ramp is not unlike
Greenberg's shot down the gatehouse tunnel. And the crisp
rectilinear frames of Neutra's houses seem to echo the endless
rectangle that Greenberg found in the valve chamber of Shaft 2B of
City Water Tunnel No. 3 in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The similarities suggest that when modern architects designed
``served'' spaces, they often looked to ``servant'' spaces for
inspiration. What were they after?
</P>
<P>
   It is in Shulman's showiest photograph _ his twilight shot of
Pierre Koenig's Case Study House No. 22 _ where the categories of
``servant'' and ``served'' meet in the most telling way.
</P>
<P>
   The photograph shows a living room that seems to be cantilevered
out over the twinkling lights of Los Angeles' grid of streets.
Inside there is a drama to rival the fantasies on the screens of
the movie theaters.
</P>
<P>
   The show playing there is not ``Meet John Doe'' or `` Smith Goes
to Washington.'' It is Mrs. Doe meets Mrs. Smith for cocktails at
six.
</P>
<P>
   Two women sit across from one another in the living room. They
look almost identical in their white party dresses. Both have their
legs crossed. This shot was carefully set up, as Shulman explained
in ``A Constructed View: The Architectural Photography of Julius
Shulman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After the floodlights were set, I had the girls sit down on
chairs,'' he recalled. ``Next I told the girls to sit down in the
dark with all the lights off, including the ceiling fixtures, and
then began exposure for ... twilight . .. I alerted the girls to
sit up and get into conversational mood _ they could continue to
talk but be relaxed. We switched on the light on the ceiling and I
flashed bulbs from my camera.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not merely a drama of escape; it is also a fantasy of
power. These women aren't isolated in suburbia. They are floating
on a cement slab above the city. The living room is an engineering
stunt worthy of a great bridge.
</P>
<P>
   The horizontal lines of the ceilings and floors run straight
from inside to outside and extend, if you use your imagination,
clear across the city, as if this house were the climax of a grand
scheme to harness the power of the city's grid, all its tunnels and
reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
   The illusion is of an escape, but one that is nonetheless
plugged into all the city's services. The house would not look
quite so lovely if the ``served'' house were not attached so
clearly to the ``serving'' city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Julius Shulman: Precision and Light: Modernist Architectural
Photographs, 1935-1963'' and ``Stanley Greenberg: Invisible New
York'' will remain at the Yancey Richardson Gallery, 560 Broadway,
at Prince Street, through Nov. 14. ``Invisible New York: The Hidden
Infrastructure of the City'' will remain at the Municipal Art
Society of New York, 457 Madison Ave., at 50th Street, through Nov.
27.

U.S. ECONOMY STILL EXPANDING, BUT MORE SLOWLY

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. economy is still expanding, but much more slowly than
in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department _ reporting on October a day ahead of
schedule after some data were accidentally posted on the
department's Internet site _ said that employers added just 116,000
workers to their payrolls last month, the unemployment rate held
steady at 4.6 percent and the hourly pay of most workers inched up
slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Though the department also said that it had badly underestimated
job growth in September _ revising its initial estimate to 157,000
jobs from 59,000 _ the labor market looked weaker in October than
forecasters had expected. Solid gains in the services and
construction sectors were offset by deep cuts by manufacturers who
are bearing the brunt of global economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``The markets for at least two weeks have been sending a very
clear message that the economy is slowing but will not lapse into
recession,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First
Albany. ``The jobs data are very consistent with that message.''
</P>
<P>
   After digesting the details of the report, which was officially
released in full at 1:30 p.m., stock investors focused on the
positive implications; the Dow Jones industrial average ended the
day up 132.33 points.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the labor market, still very tight by any
historical measure, is not getting any tighter, leaving the door
open, at least in principle, to further interest rate cuts by the
Fed. At the same time, the job market has not unraveled either. Job
security and income growth are crucial to consumer spending, the
economy's sole source of strength at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pattern is the same as for the past few months,'' said Tom
Nardone, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. ``Payroll
growth is tailing off, but not as dramatically as we feared.''
</P>
<P>
   Adjusting for the effect of the strike against General Motors
Corp. during the summer, which cut employment in July and bolstered
it in August, payrolls have risen an average of 148,000 a month in
the last three months compared with an average of 247,000 a month
in the first seven months of the year. That is the slowest pace in
the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   The dichotomy between the industrial sector and the rest of the
economy, evident since the Asian crisis first hit last winter,
widened further in October. While the sprawling services sector
added 154,000 jobs and construction payrolls expanded by 19,000,
manufacturers cut employment by 52,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest losses were in clothing and textiles, which lost
18,000 jobs, and in electronics, which lost 12,000. But there were
many smaller declines scattered across industries from machinery to
metals. Within manufacturing, Detroit was the only bright spot:
Automakers, which are still scrambling to keep up with strong
demand and to rebuild inventories depleted by the GM strike, added
7,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs have disappeared since March,
an important reason that consumers have begun to get nervous about
the global economic outlook. John Challenger, whose outplacement
firm, Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas, tracks layoff announcements,
said that the cuts could be attributed largely to mergers, cost
pressures and low oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   Companies announced _ though they did not yet carry them out _
73,000 job cuts in September and 91,000 in October, many in the
oil, metals, electronics and telecommunications sectors. Last
month, the three biggest cutbacks were announced by Halliburton Co.
and Schlumberger Ltd., two oil-services companies, and Bell
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were kinds of numbers we were seeing in 1993 at the peak
of the downsizing wave,'' Challenger said. His layoff figures had
been running as low as 20,000 a month as recently as last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Though the pace did not match that of earlier this year, hiring
in the services sector picked up last month. Computer and other
business services, which had been down in September, added 58,000
jobs. Work at temporary-help companies rose by 21,000 positions,
though the levels were still below their peak in June.
</P>
<P>
   As businesses turned to outsiders for advice, computer,
engineering and management services continued to hire; employment
grew by 13,000. And so, surprisingly, did financial-services
companies, which added 18,000 jobs, a large part in mortgage
banking, after no growth in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd create more jobs if we could find the workers,'' said
Bill Dunkelberg, chief economist of the Federation of Independent
Business. That organization's monthly survey of small businesses,
which was also released Thursday, shows that 32 percent of its
members still had openings that they could not fill.
</P>
<P>
   Total hours worked, a rough indicator of the growth of the
nation's gross domestic product, edged up two-tenths of 1 percent,
suggesting that output as well as employment expanded in October.
In an anomaly _ given the sharp drop in employment _ total hours
worked rose in manufacturing as well.
</P>
<P>
   Hourly earnings, meanwhile, barely edged up, rising by a penny
to $12.89. If the numbers are to be believed, wage inflation is
slowing. The 12-month increases peaked at 4.4 percent in June and
were down to 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists, however, consider this series less reliable
than the Labor Department's broader employment cost index, which
indicates that wage inflation rose during the summer.

 &HT;    President of Applebee's parent company resigns
 &HT;    By Mickey H. Gramig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The president and chief operating officer of Avado
Brands, formerly known as Apple South, has resigned amid
disappointing sales by the Madison-based restaurant company's
largest division.
</P>
<P>
   Former hotel industry executive S. Kirk Kinsell, who joined the
company in February 1997, is not expected to be immediately
replaced. Founder and Chief Executive Tom E. DuPree Jr., who
analysts say had taken a somewhat secondary role in the business,
is expected to assume Kinsell's duties.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Kinsell's departure, along with several divisional
management changes, ``the mission of the company, the strategic
direction of the company, really has not changed over the last
several years,'' Chief Financial Officer Erich Booth said.
</P>
<P>
   The company has been under industry scrutiny since it announced
last December that it was selling off its biggest and most
profitable division, Applebee's Neighborhood Grill &AMP; Bar. The
company was the nation's largest Applebee's franchisee, with 264
locations, and until the name change to Avado last month, its
moniker reflected that focus on Applebee's.
</P>
<P>
   The rationale for exiting the Applebee's business is so the
company could concentrate on its proprietary restaurants, which
were growing faster than the Applebee's division. However, Avado's
largest and fastest-growing chain, the 122-store Don Pablo's
Mexican Kitchen division, hasn't performed as well as expected this
year.
</P>
<P>
   And the company's stock has fallen more than 50 percent, from
$16.75, since the Applebee's sell-off was announced. The stock
closed at $7.81 1/4, down 68 3/4 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don Pablo's is the critical variable right now. Kirk appears
to have borne responsibility for that,'' said Bryan C. Elliott, a
restaurant analyst with Robinson-Humphrey.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, overall sales at Don Pablo's were down 6.7
percent; sales at locations open for at least a year, the best
measure of a restaurant company's success, were down about half a
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Robert A. Andreottola, formerly president of the Applebee's
division, was named chief executive for Don Pablo's; the position
was created this summer, around the time that Don Pablo's President
Larry Folk left and subsequently became president at Rio Bravo, a
rival Mexican chain.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Andrews, formerly with KPMG Peat Marwick, was named
chief financial officer for Don Pablo's, replacing Melba Stevens,
who left the company in September.
</P>
<P>
   Avado also named Michael B. Liedberg chief executive of its
19-store Canyon Cafe division.

 &HT;    Wait pays off for MindSpring insiders
 &HT;    By Robert Luke
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Insiders at MindSpring Enterprises _ taking advantage
of a rebound in the company's stock price _ sold some 1.9 million
shares in late October for about $75 million.
</P>
<P>
   The insiders originally had planned to sell the stock in May,
when the company sold additional shares.
</P>
<P>
   But the insiders, including founder Charles M. Brewer, decided
to postpone their sales after MindSpring Enterprises' shares fell
along with other Internet-related issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (company stock) offering went off at a price they weren't
comfortable selling at, so they pulled back at that time,''
explained Michael S. McQuary, president and chief operating
officer. He was among the insiders who sold in late October.

REPUBLICANS PARE DOWN IMPEACHMENT INVESTIGATION OF CLINTON 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rattled by election losses, House Republicans pared
down their impeachment investigation of President Clinton and
announced plans Thursday to publicly question only one witness _
independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Saying it's time to ``cut to the chase,'' Judiciary Committee
Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., outlined a bare-bones hearing schedule
and sent a letter to the president asking him to ``admit or deny''
81 allegations about his conduct with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, whose panel is investigating whether Clinton illegally
tried to cover up his affair with Lewinsky and should be impeached,
said the letter could help narrow the list of disputed issues and
bring the inquiry to a quick end.
</P>
<P>
   Other key figures _ such as Lewinsky, her former friend Linda
Tripp, presidential secretary Betty Currie, and presidential friend
Vernon Jordan _ are not being called before the committee because
their testimony was included in Starr's report to Congress, Hyde
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need to reinvent the wheel,'' said the chairman. ``I
like to cut to the chase on everything we do.''
</P>
<P>
   After talking by telephone with Republican members of his panel,
Hyde announced the streamlined schedule at a Chicago news
conference. His statement came two days after his party lost five
House seats in the midterm election, narrowing the GOP's margin of
control. Republicans, who ran ads asking voters not to reward
Clinton's behavior by electing Democrats, had earlier forecast a
double-digit gain.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde denied the voting played a role in the decision to speed up
his hearings and cited opinion polls showing impeachment ranked low
among voter concerns. Those same surveys, however, found six of
every 10 voters saying they want the impeachment inquiry dropped.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said the
election may make impeachment less certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the House was certainly going toward articles of
impeachment (before the election), and I just don't know if that
has changed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing schedule _ which calls for Starr to appear before
Hyde's committee on Nov. 19 _ meets both major Democratic demands
that were ignored until after Tuesday's election: wrap up the
investigation quickly and bring the special prosecutor in for
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, who is under investigation for allegedly leaking secret
grand jury information embarrassing to Clinton, will be questioned
by Judiciary Committee investigators. Also interrogating the
independent counsel will be committee members, some of whom are
Clinton's most loyal supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Starr welcomes the opportunity to appear before Hyde's
committee, said spokeswoman Elizabeth Ray. ``Judge Starr will
continue to be helpful and cooperative with the Congress,'' Ray
said.
</P>
<P>
   Following Starr's appearance _ which could stretch over two days
_ the committee plans to call at least one more witness, an expert
on testifying under oath and perjury, a committee staff member
said.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart called Hyde's decision to
expedite the inquiry a ``mostly positive'' development, but said
the administration would ``withhold judgment on whether that
process will ultimately be fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart declined comment on the committee chairman's letter _
which includes questions about findings from Starr's report of
possible impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The letter asks the president to concede the accuracy of the
findings or provide a detailed denial of those he believes are
untrue. The questions cover a wide range of issues related to the
Lewinsky affair, but none involve the sexually graphic material
that make up the bulk of Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
   The questions in Hyde's letter include inquiries about
misleading statements Clinton acknowledges making under oath in
Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit against him. The statements
involved gifts he and Lewinsky had exchanged that Currie, the
president's secretary, later retrieved from Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Hyde asks about lies Clinton told to White House
staff members and his public denials of an affair with Lewinsky.
Also in the letter are questions about Clinton's assistance to
Lewinsky in obtaining a job in New York and about his conversations
with Currie after Jones' lawyers surprised him with detailed
questions about Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton denies claims made by other witnesses who testified
before Starr's grand jury, the Judiciary Committee will have to
decide whether to try to resolve the disputed information or let it
drop.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said his letter to Clinton was designed to help ``narrow
the issues and bring this matter to a close more quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is free to dispute, of course, whatever he
wants. But by agreeing to those facts that he does not dispute, he
will allow us to narrow the issues and bring this matter to a close
more quickly,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said Starr might also be questioned about Whitewater,
misuse of FBI files, and the White House travel office firings,
topics he has examined during his four-year, $40 million
investigation of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has notified the Judiciary Committee that he is
considering whether to provide an additional ground for impeaching
Clinton. The allegation deals with Clinton's denial during his Aug.
17 grand jury appearance that he groped Kathleen Willey during a
White House meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Willey provided details of the November 1993 encounter to
Starr's grand jury, to lawyers in Paula Jones' sexual harassment
lawsuit against Clinton and on national television.
</P>
<P>
   While heartened by Hyde's expedited investigation agenda,
Democrats on the Judiciary Committee complained that they had not
been consulted about scheduling or limiting the number of
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan Rep. John Conyers, the ranking Democrat on the panel,
said it is ``unclear ... why the chairman would request
stipulations from the president on matters on which he has already
testified and for which there is already evidence available.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans are proceeding, as usual, with the cart before
the horse and in a manner that is not bipartisan,'' said Rep.
Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas. &QL;

`THE SPIRIT LIVES': A PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE ON THE SPANISH CIVIL
WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By MARGARETT LOKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Spanish Civil War pitted the well-equipped and
well-trained nationalist armed forces, led by Franco, against the
poorly armed and trained troops of the elected Republican
government. It was an unequal contest: Franco's forces were backed
by Hitler and Mussolini, and the leftist-liberal Republicans, or
Loyalists, were supported by the Soviet Union and the International
Brigades, some 40,000 volunteers with little or no fighting
experience from 52 countries who wanted to stop Fascism.
</P>
<P>
   Long on idealism but short on military know-how, the Republican
cause was doomed, even as it drew such champions as Andre Malraux,
Ernest Hemingway, George Orwell, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Tina
Modotti, Hans Namuth, David Seymour and Robert Capa.
</P>
<P>
   Then as now, some of the most compelling images of that war are
Capa's 1936 photograph of a Loyalist falling in battle; Picasso's
1937 painting ``Guernica,'' a wrenching tribute to the victims of
German aerial bombing of a Basque village, and Hemingway's 1940
novel, ``For Whom the Bell Tolls.''
</P>
<P>
   But if one could see the Spanish Civil War freed from these
familiar images, what would it be? ``The Spirit Lives: Photos From
the Spanish Civil War, 1936-39,'' at the Puffin Room in SoHo, comes
close to giving a freshly personal perspective to this conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn from the archives of the International Institute of Social
History in Amsterdam, most of the photographs in this exhibition
have not been shown before in the United States. They survived the
war because they were sent to the Paris branch of the Confederacion
Nacional del Trabajo, a major labor union and player in the war,
then to England and eventually to Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the photographers in ``The Spirit Lives'' bring a
so-called snapshot esthetic to their pictures of Republicans and
leftists preparing for war or at war. The photographers are all
anonymous except for Sam Walters, a veteran of the American
contingent of volunteers, the Lincoln Brigade.
</P>
<P>
   And the pictures are mostly quiet, taken by people who share a
casual familiarity with their subjects. It is that very
ordinariness that gives these images their surreal power.
</P>
<P>
   In an overhead shot of a roadside scene, a crowd has gathered
around a truck, which has the union's initials on the hood and
windshield. Another crowd stands and watches from the pavement,
both groups oblivious to a cannon parked nearby. What is going on?
``Distributing arms to the people from a C.N.T. truck, Madrid,
1936,'' the caption says.
</P>
<P>
   A picture of boys marching down the street on a sun-splattered
day appear to be playing at war, rifles over one shoulder. But the
rifles look suspiciously lethal, and emblazoned on the chest of
each boy's sweater is a star, at the center of which is the hammer
and sickle insignia. These are ``Young Communists exercising on the
streets of Madrid, 1936,'' the caption says.
</P>
<P>
   Two young couples pose for the camera as if out walking in the
park, the men in uniform, the women fresh-faced and smiling. They
are part of the Garcia Oliver Column setting out in 1936 from their
barracks in Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
   In 1931, a year before women first voted in Spain, the
Republican constitution introduced political equality for men and
women. Early in the war, a few women were leading figures of the
Republic, including the fiery Dolores Ibarruri, the Communist
leader known as La Pasionaria, who famously told the Republicans on
the radio in July 1936: ``It is better to die on your feet than to
live on your knees! They shall not pass!''
</P>
<P>
   But this liberating time for women was short-lived. They were
soon ordered back home to tend to housework or to work in
factories, replacing men who had gone to war. But while it lasted,
photographers made many striking images of fighting women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anarchist militiawoman, undated,'' in the exhibition, is a
close-up of a determined young woman, her hair tucked into a helmet
bearing a skull-and-bones sketch, the shiny barrel of a rifle
against one shoulder, her pale eyes steady.
</P>
<P>
   ``Militiawoman, Barcelona, July 1936'' shows a different kind of
fighter. Here, a young woman, in blouse, skirt and sandals, a purse
hanging from a belt, walks cheerfully down the street, toting a
rifle.
</P>
<P>
   In an arresting image, three Loyalists lie in wait on the edge
of a cliff overlooking a bucolic valley. Two are uniformed
soldiers; between them is a woman in a dress and sandals. And in
``Three generations of resistance, undated,'' a grim white-haired
woman raises a clenched fist, her daughter and granddaughter
following suit.
</P>
<P>
   In the photographs by Sam Walters, his camera is turned on the
international contingent and Loyalists waiting to go to war. These
pictures have a certain Yankee humor and directness, particularly
one of Jack Corrigan.
</P>
<P>
   According to the caption, this young man is convalescing, but
with his chest bare, a straw hat on his head, a bunch of grapes in
one hand, he looks in the pink of health. The caption, however,
says he was killed soon after the picture was taken.
</P>
<P>
   Walters shows a volunteer painting while he waits to be called
to battle. A Loyalist peruses an English-language newspaper. And in
a poignant photograph, three young women look out a high window
protected by a metal grill. They are smiling, care free, seemingly
untouched by war.
</P>
<P>
   The counterpoint of this image, taken by an anonymous
photographer, is ``Militiaman and girlfriend saying goodbye,
Barcelona, August 1936.'' Photographed from above, this is a spare
picture of a couple surrounded by people yet intensely alone, he
looking wordlessly at her, she with her eyes cast down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Spirit Lives'' ends with photographs of death and
destruction. In a devastating picture that brings to mind the image
of the stricken young woman kneeling by the slain student at Kent
State, a weeping Spanish woman, her arms outstretched in grief,
kneels by a body.
</P>
<P>
   Today, when photography has become, for many artists, a tool for
purely esthetic ends, the exhibition at the Puffin Room is a
welcome reminder that the camera can be both pitiless and powerful
when it records events that forever change people's lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Spirit Lives: Photos From the Spanish Civil War, 1936-39''
remains at the Puffin Room, 435 Broome Street, near Broadway,
through Nov. 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Spanish Civil War,'' by Abel Paz, published last year by
Hazan of Paris and available at $12.95 from D.A.P./Distributed Art
Publishers (800-338-2665), includes many of the pictures in the
exhibition as well as Paz's vivid recollections of what he saw and
did during one tumultuous and heady week in July 1936, when he was
a 15-year-old revolutionary in Barcelona.

HOW TO BUILD A KAYAK IN TUNE WITH TRADITION  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 8)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Wash.)  (af) 
 By TINA KELLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Each of us was going to build a kayak so attuned to
its environment, so highly evolved, so sturdily elegant, that it
could withstand 30-foot seas, hurricane winds and bashings from the
claw of a hammer.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, we would be joining an ancient tradition from a
cold chain of islands where nothing grew beyond knee height, where
no one had ever seen a living tree and where the boat makers
thought the driftwood they used was a gift from the sea gods.
</P>
<P>
   We would be building an Aleutian skin-covered baidarka, ``a
very, very sea-kind boat,'' our instructor said. It is at once
flexible, safe and svelte. ``If you do them right, they will be
like your personality,'' he said. ``One may be playful; one may be
conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   I had come to Corey Freedman's boat-building workshop in Seattle
because all wanted a vessel that I could hoist onto the roof rack
of my Honda Civic. By the second hour of the workshop, however, I
was a changed woman. I was ready to reserve baidarka books from the
library and dip into the fanatically detailed baidarka bulletin
board on the Internet, with its discussion of the proper placement
of spirit lines, the meaningful decorations hidden on the boat's
frame.
</P>
<P>
   Freedman is one of just a handful of specialists who teach the
nearly forgotten craft of building sea kayaks, as baidarkas are
commonly known. Our small class last month at the Center for Wooden
Boats, a nonprofit educational organization in Seattle, included a
reggae music promoter, a retired neurosurgeon, an artist and mother
enamored of anything Arctic and a journalist who hadn't touched a
router or countersink since seventh grade.
</P>
<P>
   But Freedman was ready for us: In overseeing the construction of
more than 350 boats over the last five years, he has developed a
low-key manner that put us at ease immediately. All sorts of people
have taken his course, he said, including many slight women like me
who seem to be drawn to lightweight boats. (The baidarka weighs
about 30 pounds.) Nobody, though, has ever given him a hard time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerks don't build these boats,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Freedman, 37, the son of a raw-materials distributor and a
homemaker, might seem an unlikely baidarka guru. He grew up in West
Orange, N.J., 20 miles from Manhattan and about 4,600 miles from
the Bering Sea, where baidarkas originated.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 17, after seeing baidarkas in books and at the
Smithsonian, Freedman knew that he wanted to live in the Northwest
and run a boat-building school. Eight years ago, he bought a barn
to house the operation.
</P>
<P>
   He holed up there for a year and a half to figure out how to
build the best baidarka _ and lost 35 pounds in the process. He now
runs Spirit Line Kayaks, which operates the school and makes
custom-built boats.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of class, we took several baidarkas out for a
wobbly, rudderless spin on Lake Union in the middle of Seattle,
dodging sailboats and marveling at our spindly, six-inch-wide
paddles and the kayaks' translucent skins.
</P>
<P>
   The memory of that brief cruise stayed with us as we worked nine
consecutive 10-hour days to cobble together our own crafts, bending
cedar ribs fresh out of the boiler, tying 572 rib lashings with
what feels like heavy, sticky dental floss and sewing on skin to be
tight as a drum.
</P>
<P>
   We worked without blueprints, glue or metal, just yellow and red
cedar, bamboo pegs made from whittled chopsticks (they're strong,
rot-resistant and affordable) and nylon for the lashings and skin.
The coating is the same kind of urethane used on parking garage
floors; none of the 350 boats has ever had a puncture.
</P>
<P>
   As we worked, we came to understand the reasoning behind some of
the baidarka's quirkier features, including its bifurcated bow. The
lower part it extends the keel, improving the boat's ability to
hold a course; the upper part acts as a hydrofoil, lifting the boat
above heavy seas. The U-shaped bottom helps the paddler stay
upright in swells, and the truncated stern helps the boat maneuver
in following seas.
</P>
<P>
   ``With these boats, you don't paddle them, you wear them,''
Freedman said, recalling how the native Alaskans would tie
themselves into their baidarkas to avoid falling into the frigid
sea.
</P>
<P>
   Freedman gets his wood from an 80-year-old miller in Concrete,
Wash., who salvages logs that were cut 30 or 40 years ago and cast
off because of flaws. The red cedar for the deck beams was fished
out of Baker Lake, in the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest,
while the yellow cedar ribs came from the Cascade Mountains east of
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Our seminar cost $850 including materials _ a bargain,
considering that professional builders charge several thousand
dollars for a new baidarka, and even fiberglass kayaks have retail
prices around $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   Once we had finished lashing and sewing our boats together, we
decorated, stained and coated them. My baidarka smelled of linseed
oil and cedar, wood taken from places where I had hiked just this
summer. As I lifted her easily and prepared to slip her into the
water, it was easy to think that such materials, and the old
knowledge of what to do with them, were of sacred provenance.

 &HT;    Enduring friendship: Kasdan's biggie still one great film
 &HT;    by Eleanor Ringle
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It'll still give you chills. And still make you laugh. Fifteen
years after its original release, Lawrence Kasdan's film about some
college pals from the 1960s who are reunited for a long weekend by
the suicide of one of their group is much more than a requiem for
that heavyweight decade. Though tied to a particular segment of the
population _ the baby boomers who made protest and pot a way of
life decades (eons?) ago _ the picture is really about more
enduring themes. Like friendship and change and coping and lost
ideals and found strengths and, perhaps most of all, about the many
ways we give life to those we care about.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's easygoing naturalism is an accurate, often hilarious
reconstruction of what friends are like when they're just hanging
out. Plus, not only does Kasdan understand group dynamics, but he
cast a dynamic group of actors to bring his characters to life. Try
these names as a who's who of up-and-comers from the early '80s:
Kevin Kline, Glenn Close, Jeff Goldblum, JoBeth Williams, William
Hurt, Tom Berenger, Mary Kay Place and Meg Tilly. Oh, and Kevin
Costner, in one of the most famous face-on-the-cutting-room-floor
performances in cinema history; he plays the deceased.
</P>
<P>
   Individually they're brilliant; collectively they're a miracle.
Fifteen years later, I can't think of a bunch I'd rather spend a
weekend with _ or a movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Chill''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A

   Starring Kevin Kline, Glenn Close and William Hurt. Written and

 &HT;    Style's the true star of `Velvet'
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Glitter and Be Gay,'' the title of a song from the 1950s
musical ``Candide,'' could easily serve as the unofficial anthem
for the early-'70s glam-rock scene in London that is so vividly
captured in Todd Haynes' worthy if uneven movie ``Velvet
Goldmine.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, a reporter embarks on a ``Citizen Kane''-like
investigation into the life of fictional glitter star Brian Slade
(Jonathan Rhys Meyers). Slade disappeared after a fake on-stage
assassination attempt was revealed as a hoax, thus alienating his
fans. Adding a level of complication: The reporter, Arthur Stuart
(Christian Bale), was one of those fans, and the more he digs into
Slade's life, the more he's reminded that through the rocker's
unashamed sequined sexual ambivalence, he was able to come to terms
with his own homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the story is stitched together from incidents in the
lives of real-life rock stars of the period: Brian Eno, Lou Reed,
Iggy Pop and, most especially, David Bowie. Slade even has a
party-hard American ex-wife (Toni Collette) who helps launch her
husband's anything-goes image and then regrets it.
</P>
<P>
   The Bowie comparison, alas, is one place the film goes wrong.
Rhys Meyers can't match Bowie's startling, almost otherworldly
beauty and charisma. Bowie disturbed; Rhys Meyers pouts. There's a
'90s aura of safety about him.
</P>
<P>
   A second casting problem: Rhys Meyers is upstaged by his
co-star, Ewan McGregor of ``Trainspotting.'' Soon to appear as a
new ``Star Wars'' warrior, McGregor plays Curt Wild, an American
rock idol whose Dionysian fury Slade both admires and envies. Slade
and his manager, Jerry Divine (Eddie Izzard, a dead ringer for the
early-'70s Oliver Reed), rescue a drugged-out Wild from his own
burnout and reinvent him as part of Slade's brazen bisexual circus.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes, whose earlier work includes ``Safe'' and ``Poison,'' is
all over the place. He doesn't give us a persona to ponder as much
as he does an era. The clothes, the hair, the terrific soundtrack,
even the opening credits are all an impeccably heightened
re-creation of the time.
</P>
<P>
   But Haynes isn't just trying for an ``Austin Powers'' nostalgia
kick. He sees glam rock's brief reign as a kind of bold rebirth of
dandyism, symbolized _ rather heavily, I'm afraid _ by an enigmatic
figure named Jack Fairy (Micko Westmoreland.) Fairy is the
unsinkable spirit of the Once and Future Queen, inheritor of Oscar
Wilde's emerald brooch, which he passes on to Slade, who passes it
to Wild, who passes it to Stuart.
</P>
<P>
   The film's subtext is that it took the fearless camp-aggression
cool of performers such as Bowie to liberate a generation of
teenagers ashamed or afraid of their sexual orientation. For those
who made that journey _ and for those still struggling with it _
``Velvet Goldmine'' will have an extra resonance. But while the
film, stylistically, has plenty of crossover appeal for straight
audiences, it lacks emotional heft. Haynes is trying to cover so
many bases that his picture's second half is long-winded and
unfocused.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is a lively, imaginative and, on one level,
heartfelt film. Near its end, a character says somewhat
regretfully, ``We set out to change the world and ended up changing
ourselves.'' Yet they helped create a world in which movies like
``Velvet Goldmine'' can be made. And be seen. No small thing when
you think about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Velvet Goldmine''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>

   Starring Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Ewan McGregor and Toni Collette.

 &HT;    `Life' enfolds hate in beautiful lie
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Your reaction to ``Life Is Beautiful'' (``La Vita E Bella'') may
depend on your feelings about the POW-camp antics of ``Hogan's
Heroes.'' Only, this film goes much further out on a limb. It's
about the various comic strategies designed by an Italian Jew to
fool his son into thinking that their incarceration in a
concentration camp is just a game.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, it's those wacky Nazis, with their ``showers'' and ovens.
Creepy? You bet. Yet, at the same time, you may feel a certain
admiration for the crazy mush-headed courage of writer/director
Roberto Benigni, who also plays the father. The jury at the Cannes
Film Festival last spring certainly did. They awarded him the Grand
Jury Prize.
</P>
<P>
   The film's first section, set in rural Italy in 1939, showcases
Benigni's Lou Costello low-comedy style. He's Guido, an
accident-prone dreamer with two things on his mind: opening his own
bookstore and marrying Dora (Nicoletta Braschi), a local teacher.
Fans of Benigni (I'm not among them) may enjoy his slapstick
attempts to bluff his way into a school assembly or his bumbling
shtick as a waiter at his uncle's hotel. The gags in general are
silent-comedy broad, and while Benigni may share Jim Carrey's
elasticity, he also has a weakness for strained pathos that
suggests late Jerry Lewis (Lewis made his own Nazi comedy, ``The
Day the Clown Cried,'' in the early '70s; a personal project, it
was never released).
</P>
<P>
   Though hints of anti-Semitism have been dispensed all along, the
film takes a darker turn after Guido and Dora are married and have
a small son, Giosue (adorable Giorgio Cantarini). The Nazis scoop
up father and son and put them on a cattle car. Dora, who is not
Jewish, begs to be taken, too, but she lands in a different camp.
Doing his best to protect the boy from fear and despair, Guido
insists that everything from the bare barracks to the bullying
guards is part of a giant contest with complicated, ever-changing
rules. The winner gets a shiny new tank.
</P>
<P>
   That Guido can so easily hide the horror from his son is hard to
buy. Further, the contrast between his manic foolishness and his
dead-eyed barracks-mates is so jarring that, at times, you wonder
why one of them doesn't just slap him silly.
</P>
<P>
   But balancing these negatives are some positives. Most notably,
the film's unflinching presentation of the simple, obscene facts of
the Final Solution. ``Shoah'' in all its haunting entirety doesn't
get more direct than little Giosue's frightened query, asking his
father if it's true that ``they make us into buttons and soap.''
It's a chilling moment that Guido determinedly makes light of by
clowning around: ``Look, I'm washing my hands with Bartolomeo. I'm
buttoning my shirt with Vittorini.''
</P>
<P>
   You can see why it's difficult to know what, exactly, to make of
``Life Is Beautiful.'' Putting a life-affirming spin on something
as horrifying as extermination does take a certain mettle, to say
nothing of a unique vision. But ``Life Is Beautiful'' kept striking
me as a beautiful lie _ a Holocaust film with a happy ending. And
I'm not convinced that the way to deal with monsters is not to take
them too seriously, though the argument could surely be made. I
guess the best way to look at ``Life Is Beautiful'' is to call it
the best concentration camp comedy I've ever seen. I also hope it's
the last.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life Is Beautiful''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring and directed by Roberto Benigni. Rated PG-13 for
Holocaust-related atrocities. In Italian with English subtitles. 2
hours, 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: ``Springtime for Hitler,'' for real.

DEMOCRATS IN SOUTH BENEFIT FROM LARGE BLACK TURNOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By KEVIN SACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When it came to getting the black vote out for
Tuesday's election, Roy Barnes did not leave much to chance.
</P>
<P>
   In the final days of the race, Georgia's Democratic candidate
for governor used every opportunity, in both his speeches and his
advertising, to accuse his Republican opponent of trying to divide
the state by race. The state Democratic Party targeted three
telephone calls and two mailings at each of 300,000 black
households, many of them in majority black Atlanta, with one flier
reminding voters that the Republican candidate for lieutenant
governor had threatened to ``kick Atlanta's ass.'' And last Sunday
morning, Barnes did not simply attend services at one black church.
He went to four, escorted by Atlanta's first black mayor and a
black Cabinet secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Those efforts were rewarded on Tuesday. Black voters went to
Georgia's polls in force, and 9 out of 10 cast ballots for Barnes,
according to surveys of voters leaving the polls. He almost
certainly would not have won without their extraordinary support.
As it was, he cruised to a nine-point victory over his Republican
opponent, Guy Millner, despite falling short of the 40 percent of
the white vote usually considered necessary for a Democrat to win
in this increasingly two-party state.
</P>
<P>
   Across much of the South, where Democrats on Tuesday won some of
their most significant victories in years, including the
governorships of South Carolina and Alabama, the same pattern
emerged. Although blacks comprised about the same share of the
national electorate as they did four years ago, according to
surveys of voters leaving the polls, their numbers increased
significantly in crucial Southern states.
</P>
<P>
   The fallout from that political debt will be substantial,
analysts said. ``In terms of governing, Tuesday's black turnout is
going to mean a heightened sensitivity to the concerns of blacks
within the party, perhaps in the way of particular policies,
appointments and benefits,'' said Merle Black, an Emory University
political scientist and an authority on Southern politics. ``And
that will be something that will persist for the indefinite
future.''
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, it took less than 24 hours for the state's
legislative black caucus to send its payback demands in a telegram
to Governor-elect Don Siegelman, a Democrat who defeated Gov. Fob
James Jr. The demands included the appointment of two blacks to
Siegelman's transition team and the selection of blacks for at
least one third of his cabinet positions. A spokeswoman for
Siegelman said he would make his appointments based on merit.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, Rep. James Clyburn, a black Democrat who
worked diligently to turn out the vote for Governor-elect Jim
Hodges, said he found the use of the word ``demands'' to be
distasteful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not be too pointed in our language,'' Clyburn said. ``We
can do this without using those inflammatory terms.'' But he added
that Hodges clearly must pay attention to his black constituents.
``He's a smart guy,'' Clyburn said. ``He knows where his margin of
victory was, and I don't think there's going to be any problem
getting our concerns addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Democrats' strength on Tuesday may also expose their
most enduring vulnerability as they challenge the Republicans for
majority status in the South. If the Democrats ever hope to lure
white moderates and suburban residents back into the fold, they
must shed the perception that the party is beholden to special
interests, including minorities, political scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Democrats can rejoice that they finally managed
to stall the seemingly inexorable advance of Republican troops
through the South. In the 11 states of the old Confederacy, they
claimed a net gain of one governorship, moving from three to four,
compared to eight in 1980. They picked up one Senate seat, and now
have eight in the region, compared to 16 in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   There was no numerical change in the South's congressional
representation, with Democrats continuing to hold 54 of the 125
seats, down from 77 of 108 seats in 1980. The Democrats won back
the North Carolina House of Representatives, which had been
considered a prime target for a Republican takeover. Now they will
hold 58 percent of all Southern legislative seats.
</P>
<P>
   But the importance of the black turnout to this year's
Democratic victories underscores the thesis that the party's
successes do not necessarily suggest any broad partisan realignment
in the South. Rather, many political analysts argue that the
Democrats benefited from unique circumstances that will be
difficult to replicate.
</P>
<P>
   This year's elections were influenced by a broad array of
unusual factors. The Democrats fielded moderate candidates who were
uncommonly well-financed. In South Carolina, for example, video
poker interests poured millions of dollars into defeating Gov.
David easley, a Republican who had crusaded to ban the industry.
Much of that money was spent on turning out the black vote,
Democratic officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In both South Carolina and Alabama, where Democrats won
governorships for the first time in 16 years, voters responded to
highly disciplined campaigns that focused on proposals for state
lotteries that would finance educational improvements. In the
governors' races in Georgia and Alabama, the Republicans fielded
flawed candidates _ a two-time loser in Georgia who went on to fail
a third time, and an incumbent in Alabama who had alienated many in
his own party by focusing relentlessly on social issues.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The heightened black vote was stimulated at least in part by
anger over the Republicans' pursuit of impeachment proceedings
against President Clinton, who remains popular among blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic strategists happily exploited that anger. One mailing
sent to black voters last week by the Georgia Democratic Party
featured photographs of Speaker Newt Gingrich and Kenneth Starr,
the Whitewater independent counsel. ``They couldn't win at the
ballot box, so now they want to overturn our choice,'' the
advertisement read. ``Send them a message.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did his part by speaking at a black church in Baltimore
last Sunday and by granting an interview that was broadcast on
Monday night on the BET cable network.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, black voters may also have been motivated by the
presence of three black candidates on the statewide ticket, two of
whom won. And they seem to have been incited by the perception that
Millner and his running mate, Mitch Skandalakis, had engaged in
race-baiting.
</P>
<P>
   Both men railed against the management of the city of Atlanta,
which has a black mayor that Skandalakis described in a television
advertisement as ``an incompetent boob.'' Millner closed his
campaign with an advertisement charging that Barnes favored racial
quotas in college admissions and state contracts, an accusation
that Barnes denied.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kahn, Barnes' campaign consultant, said the black vote
was ``essential, indispensable'' to his candidate's victory. In a
state where 27 percent of all registered voters are black and where
blacks almost always vote less reliably than whites, 29 percent of
Tuesday's voters were black, according to polls of voters leaving
the polling place conducted by Voter News Service. That compared to
16 percent in 1994 and 25 percent in the 1996 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
   Exit poll data was less clear in other states, with changes
within the statistical margin of error, but was consistent with
reports of heavier black voting. Compared to 1994, the black share
of the total vote was up two percentage points in South Carolina,
where Sen. Ernest Hollings, a Democrat, held on to his seat and
where Hodges, the former minority leader of the state House of
Representatives, ousted Gov. David Beasley. It was up two
percentage points over 1996 in North Carolina, where John Edwards,
a Democratic trial lawyer, defeated Sen. Lauch Faircloth, a
conservative Republican.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, where Siegelman unseated the incumbent Republican
governor, Fob James Jr., the black share of the vote declined by
one percentage point. But Siegelman won 95 percent of the black
votes cast, a bit more than the percentage won by other Southern
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most meaningful tribute to the Democrats'
organizational skills came from an unlikely source. ``All of us
want to pay the greatest respect to the ability of the Democrats in
this election to turn out their base,'' House Speaker Newt Gingrich
said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, who represents a congressional district outside of
Atlanta, said the Democrats ``have found a pretty effective formula
for competing with us head to head'' in the South. ``I think that
drive toward being a majority is now a little more in doubt,
frankly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, an estimated 260,000 blacks turned out on
Tuesday, about 50,000 more than in 1994, and Hodges defeated
Beasley by about 82,000 votes. In Georgia, an estimated 520,000
blacks voted, more than twice the 1994 number, and Barnes won by
about 150,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of selected precincts in the Atlanta area suggests
that this year's higher black turnout may have been a windfall from
increased voter registration under the motor voter law, which
enables people to register to vote in a variety of government
agencies, including motor vehicle offices.
</P>
<P>
   There were a number of precincts here in which the percentage of
black registered voters who showed up at the polls was actually
less than in previous elections. But the raw number of black voters
in those precincts was still higher because there is now a larger
group of blacks who are registered. Since 1994, the black share of
the electorate increased by three percentage points in Georgia and
nearly two points in South Carolina and North Carolina, and
remained about the same in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans won the governorships in the two largest Southern
states, with George W. Bush being re-elected in Texas and his
brother Jeb winning in Florida. But in the states where Democrats
won, they won handily, with Siegelman defeating James by 16
percentage points, Barnes winning by 9 and Hodges by 8 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many Republicans said those victories were poor tests of
the South's partisan loyalties. Beasley argued that his loss in
South Carolina, like those of other Southern Republicans, was ``an
aberration'' generated by unique circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had nothing to do with the Republican Party,'' he said.
``South Carolina is a Republican state, and will continue to be a
Republican state.''

(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 8) 
(af) 
 By PETER PASSELL  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Honda _ more to the point, Acura, Honda's luxury-sport division
_ has a problem. While the company's smaller cars, everything from
the Honda Civic and Accord to the Acura Integra and NSX, are class
beaters, its offerings in the hot ``entry level'' luxury market
have been greeted with yawns.
</P>
<P>
   The now-forgotten Vigor struck few customers as superior to the
less expensive Accord. And the 2.5TL, the Vigor's replacement,
proved to be an overpriced, underpowered bore.
</P>
<P>
   What to do? Acura stuck by the TL name, but has transformed the
car into a slick performer _ a worthy rival to the $30,000-plus
sport sedans from Mercedes-Benz, Saab, Volvo, Infiniti, Lexus and
many others.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, on the assumption that half-measures would not be
adequate to redeem the brand, Acura priced the new American-made
3.2TL several thousand dollars below comparably equipped
competitors from Europe and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with a sticker of $28,405 and a long list of standard
equipment, the sales strategists for the 3.2TL seem determined to
make the car the price-performance leader in this crowded corner of
the market.
</P>
<P>
   Get past the bad news: the styling. While the new TL was
designed at Honda's studio in California with an eye on the
American market, the finished product is still hard to spot in a
crowd of Japanese sedans. But that is the only criticism that
sticks.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the 3.2TL is a model of comfort, functionality and cool
good looks. The firm, nicely padded seats are covered in lush
leather; the driver's eight-way power seat, with lumbar support, is
infinitely adjustable. Controls, with oversize buttons and
uncluttered dials, are easy to read and use. And thanks to the
roomy cabin, the 3.2TL's back seat is a pleasure for two passengers
and is perfectly adequate for three. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every luxury convenience is standard equipment on the
3.2TL. The front seats are heated. The rear-view mirror
automatically darkens at night. The Bose-designed five-speaker
stereo, complete with cassette and CD players along with an
exceptionally sensitive radio, is superb.
</P>
<P>
   The automatic climate control system has a dust filter as well
as separate vents for the rear passengers. A power sliding and
tilting moonroof, keyless locking, anti-theft protection,
side-window defoggers, an outside temperature gauge,
steering-mounted audio controls, high-intensity-discharge
headlights _ even a second 12-volt outlet _ are included for the
base price.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the only options are floor mats at $109 and a navigation
system linked to global positioning satellites, at $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   But don't misunderstand what Acura has done. While the 3.2TL
offers luxury at a bargain price, the engineers were very much in
charge of the redesign. They abandoned the oddball five-cylinder
engine of the Vigor and the 2.5TL in favor of a zippy, all-new
3.2-liter aluminum V6 with variable valve timing.
</P>
<P>
   This very modern power plant delivers 225 horsepower and rockets
to 60 mph in less than 8 seconds, yet manages to go 27 highway
miles on a gallon of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   To complement the new engine, which is exclusive to the TL as of
now, Acura added a new four-speed automatic transmission that
offers both ``grade logic'' that alters the shift patterns on hills
and a Sportshift function that allows manual gear changes like
Porsche's Tiptronic.
</P>
<P>
   Less obvious, but equally important, the engineers toughened the
front suspension and installed a new rear suspension worthy of a
real sport sedan. Anti-skid brakes, 16-inch wheels with low-profile
tires and an advanced traction control system round out the
package.
</P>
<P>
   The proof is in the driving, of course, and here the TL does not
disappoint. The sedan feels big because it is, measuring four
inches longer and weighing 200 pounds more than an Accord. But size
does not translate into awkwardness.
</P>
<P>
   The TL's road manners are crisp, nicely straddling the line
between Teutonic firmness and Detroit sponginess. Cornering is a
pleasure, with little evidence of the understeer that sends many
front-wheel-drive cars forward when the driver wants to turn, or
the dreaded torque steer, a wobbly feel in the wheel so common on
takeoff in high-powered front-drive cars.
</P>
<P>
   Most drivers, I would guess, won't use the Sportshift much
because the automatic transmission does such a good job of
adjusting to hills. But this semi-manual mode does offer an
adrenaline rush on quiet, twisty roads, where it is practical to
keep the engine revving near the 6,300 rpm redline.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the new 3.2TL is not a sports car in sedan disguise. It
won't tempt drivers addicted to the more precise handling of a
3-Series BMW or the Audi A4. But the Audi and BMW are smaller
vehicles that trade a measure of comfort for performance, and they
are less indulgent for long-distance highway cruising.
</P>
<P>
   The more relevant comparisons are with the Lexus ES300, the
Infiniti I30, the C-Class Mercedes, perhaps the Cadillac Catera.
And here, the TL is second to none, offering more bang for the buck
along with the promise of superior fuel economy and low maintenance
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, of course, someone will come up with a better midsize
luxury sedan at a better price. But for the moment, Acura is top
dog in the pack.

SPORTS COLUMN: EVEN ATHLETES GET BENEFIT OF THE LAW  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By IRA BERKOW    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the first things you have to know about football players
is that if they truly cared about the health and welfare of others,
they wouldn't be playing football. Breaking someone's bones, after
all, is an aspect of the job description.
</P>
<P>
   And one of the first things you have to know about people who
run football is that if they truly cared about the health and
welfare of their football players, they wouldn't let them play
football.
</P>
<P>
   What must also be known about football players is that under the
law they must to be treated like any other citizen engaged in any
other occupation in the Republic. Even if they stand 6 feet 9
inches, weigh 350 pounds and have a cantaloupe for brains.
</P>
<P>
   The point that one out of five of the 500 players in the
National Football League, according to a recent study, has had some
brush with the law, from an arrest to an indictment to a
conviction, has led some to say that the league, for the crass
benefit of profit, turns a blind eye and deaf ear to the sometimes
repugnant if not illegal and even violent off-the-field activities
of some of its _ and our _ Sunday heroes.
</P>
<P>
   A most recent and egregious example occurred last week when
Leonard Little, a St. Louis Rams linebacker, was charged with
involuntary manslaughter after he rammed his sports utility vehicle
into a car. The other driver died, and tests found that Little's
blood-alcohol level was about twice the legal limit.
</P>
<P>
   To compound the problem, or perhaps to illuminate it, the Rams'
head coach, Dick Vermeil, said he would welcome Little back with
enthusiasm, ``I think it'll be good for him to get back and get
with his teammates and get going again.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Little is such an important player to us that
what he does elsewhere is his business _ and the law's _ as long as
he still sacks quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   In an Op-Ed article in Wednesday's New York Times, Jeff
Benedict, a co-author (with Don Yaeger) of the recently published
book, ``Pros and Cons: The Criminals Who Play in the NFL,'' wrote
that ``felons'' are allowed to play in the NFL, and should not be.
He said that ``the league today has dozens of players who have gone
from jail to the playing field.'' The NFL, Benedict added, ``should
declare ineligible for the college draft any player who has shown a
pattern of arrests for violent or drug-related crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It should also ban any current player who is convicted of a
violent crime or felony drug offense, with the option to reinstate
the player later,'' Benedict said.
</P>
<P>
   While a worrisome number of players in the league have had legal
problems _ and the league and the players' union provide for
counseling _ it is also understood that one who has paid his debt
to society under the law cannot be discriminated against in hiring.
</P>
<P>
   And just because 70,000 people cheer the exploits of a running
back charged with, say, rape or domestic violence or unlawful use
of a gun or some other heinous crime, it doesn't mean the man did
it. After all, there is a presumption of innocence _ the athlete's
role model or hero status, the fictions of an advertising age,
notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's only fair to give a man a second chance,'' said
Don Shula, the former coach of the Miami Dolphins, at the recent
Boys' and Girls' Club of America Hall of Fame dinner in New York.
``Sometimes it works; sometimes it doesn't. I remember that Irving
Fryar had a lot of problems when he played for us, but he overcame
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Shula might have added that if you can contribute to the team,
you are given a second or third or even fourth chance, unless, like
Lawrence Phillips, domestic assaulter but runner supreme, you may
actually be finished after your fifth or sixth chance.
</P>
<P>
   And if legal charges are dropped or the player is acquitted _
recall the false accusation against Michael Irvin _ the league
shouldn't play judge and jury and make its own findings.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict added that ``for years the NFL has been suspending and
banning playeRs who gamble or use steroids. Certainly, rapists and
drug dealers should be as strictly punished as a player who places
a bet.''
</P>
<P>
   Gambling and the use of steroids _ to gain an unfair advantage
and perhaps force opponents to use harmful drugs in order to
compete _ may affect the integrity of the game. The league is
within its bounds to ban players for that. As for the rest, what do
we have courts and hoosegows and gendarmes for, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   If guys aren't running from the law _ even, and this is
difficult to write, Leonard Little _ the law says properly that
they may be allowed, if they choose, to don football frocks and run
into each other for a living. &QL;

 &HT;    Annie Glenn goes where she wouldn't before: In front of the
media
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHNSON SPACE CENTER, Texas _ While John Glenn cruised the high
frontier on Thursday, his wife Annie explored a frontier of her own
_ the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Once afflicted with such a bad stutter she could not answer the
telephone, Annie Glenn sat with their son, Dr. David Glenn, and
their daughter Lyn in their first full-blown news conference since
NASA announced John Glenn's return to space in January.
</P>
<P>
   Annie Glenn described her feelings about her husband's fiery
ride into the heavens, their video and email exchanges and her
thoughts about the future _ feelings and opinions she could not
share when Glenn made his first space flight in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   She shunned the press then, but not because she had nothing to
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``People thought before that I was shy. I was not shy. I just
couldn't talk,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was an 85 percent stutterer. My kids answered my phone. My
neighbors helped me. John had always done so much for me,'' said
Glenn, who grew up with her husband in New Concord, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   But she lived quietly in the shadow of her astronaut-senator
husband's public life while one speech therapy program after
another failed her. Nineteen years ago, she said, she took a
three-week program that ``changed my life. I'm like a butterfly let
out of a cocoon. I make speeches. I have interviews.''
</P>
<P>
   So, nearly four decades later, Glenn sat on a stage with her
children before a battery of cameras and microphones and described
the emotional impact of her husband's first launch on an Atlas
rocket _ not to mention the many stalled countdowns that preceded
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so unknown, and I had watched a couple of the Atlases
explode. . . I was scared,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The anxiety of the delays caused the already petite woman to
lose weight. ``I was really glad it was over,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, she accompanied her husband to his training
sessions and, at mission commander Curtis Brown's invitation, sat
in on two weeks of training classes for the current mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had so much confidence in this orbiter and this
launching,'' she said, but she admitted that when Discovery roared
off the pad in Florida, ``I cried.''
</P>
<P>
   David Glenn said he was initially against the whole idea of his
father's return to space. ``It was pretty hard to accept. . . what
immediately came to my mind was the whole Challenger thing,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The space shuttle Challenger was destroyed and its seven crew
members killed when it exploded 70 seconds after launch in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   But David Glenn said he knew the shuttle has had a good safety
record since then, and his father ``was just like a little kid''
during training.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so happy and you just couldn't help but be happy for
him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lyn Glenn said the close relationships that developed among
Discovery's crew and family members during training helped her
accept her father's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say enough good about how NASA treats families and how
NASA has taken great consideration of the other human beings
involved in this besides the crew,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Annie Glenn said the training classes turned her into an
enthusiastic supporter of her husband's flight, but she doesn't
want him to try another one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over these months I've gotten to know the crew and I've
learned more and more and more, and I think it's very exciting. . .
But, more flights _ no,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, she wants some measure of privacy, and
Glenn's return to space has brought them more public attention than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always kept our private life private. We are a very
close family,'' she said. ``I'm going to hang onto that private
life as much as I possibly can.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she said, she hopes the attention she has received might
inspire others with stuttering problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been trying to devote as much time as I can to other
stutterers. . . I've been traveling a lot to make speeches, but I'm
getting a little older (and) it's very tiring,'' she told the media
crowd. ``Just being able to talk to all of you, this is one way I
can spread the word.''

 &HT;    GOP lashing out against Newt Gingrich and John Linder
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington _ Republicans looking to place blame for Tuesday's
election results are focusing on a pair of Georgians, Newt Gingrich
and John Linder.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the two longtime allies are jabbing at each other as they
fight to retain their positions in the congressional leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich has agreed to a change that threatens Linder's position
as chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee,
which recruits candidates and raises money for House elections.
</P>
<P>
   With that change, House Republicans will elect a NRCC chairman,
rather than allow Gingrich to continue to appoint one. That move
would force Linder to run for another two years in the job.
</P>
<P>
   Linder, appointed to the NRCC post by Gingrich in 1996, said the
change illustrates that Gingrich is prepared to sacrifice even his
most loyal defenders in an attempt to preserve his hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when Newt Gingrich's wife left a press conference
in tears when he blamed her. So I don't think he has any
compunction about blaming me,'' Linder said from his home in
Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Linder made his comments, he telephoned to say he
regretted injecting Marianne Gingrich into the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to a 1989 news conference that the Gingriches
called to explain the controversial financial backing for a book
the couple wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich told reporters his wife had set up the financial
arrangements for the book and she came to the news conference armed
with documents that provided details of her work.
</P>
<P>
   She fled the conference in tears, but news accounts at the time
said she was upset by reporters' behavior and questions, not her
husband's actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Gingrich left the room because of the media's overbearing
and irrelevant line of question and its shoddy treatment of her
husband,'' Christina Martin, Gingrich's spokeswoman, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Martin would not otherwise respond to Linder's comments.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of a rift between Georgia's most influential
members of Congress threatened to deepen the discord among
Republicans who are trying to assess who is at fault for the loss
of five seats in Tuesday's election, which left them with the
smallest majority since 1953. The 106th Congress will have 223
Republicans, 211 Democrats and one independent.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans will gather Nov. 18 to pick leaders for the next
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Both Linder and Gingrich, at home in Marietta, worked the
telephones Thursday to shore up support amid indications that most
leaders in the House would have opponents for a new term.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich talked to dozen of colleagues, Martin said. ``The phone
calls have been very instructive and most of them have been
personally favorable to Gingrich,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One call went to House Majority Whip Tom DeLay of Texas, the
third-ranking Republican in the House. Gingrich asked for DeLay's
vote and the Texan promised it, DeLay spokesman Michael Scanlon
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.), at a news conference in Chicago,
pointedly refused to endorse Gingrich for another term as speaker.
Hyde said he thought Gingrich would be re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a reporter asked if Gingrich, who led the Republican
takeover of Congress four years ago, should get another term.
``Good morning,'' Hyde said, ending the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.) offered conditional support for Gingrich,
who represents a neighboring district. ``I intend to support Newt
at this time, but I will retain an open mind in terms of the issues
we discuss and the answers I get'' at the meeting later this month,
Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   Barr and Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.) were, however, adamant that
Gingrich not make Linder a scapegoat for the disappointing
political season, and expressed dismay about the developing rift
between the Georgians.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Linder has supported Gingrich during some dark periods.
We in our Georgia delegation should not focus on each other,''
Kingston said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Linder has defended Gingrich against ethics
charges from Democrats and accusation of ineffective leadership
from conservative Republicans. He prowled the floor of the House in
1995 and 1996, during Gingrich's first term as speaker, and was
quick to respond to the Democrats' frequent attacks on Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Linder is in some ways the natural target for frustrated
Republicans, partly because he has been so close to Gingrich. But
he also predicted modest gains for Republicans all year and begged,
cajoled and even threatened incumbents to contribute to his
committee's $26 million ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The committee put more money into the 1998 campaign, $40
million, than any of its predecessors, said Mary Crawford, the
committee spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Linder has argued that the results would have been worse without
his efforts. And he said he received encouragement from other
Republicans, including the man who appears to be the most serious
threat to Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Linder said Rep. Robert Livingston of Louisiana, who is mulling
running for speaker, pledged to do whatever he can to help Linder
win his fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Livingston said he'd talked to 60 people and only one said
anything critical about me,'' Linder said. ``Livingston said he
would do whatever it takes to help me.''
</P>
<P>
   A Livingston aide said he could not confirm the substance of
their conversation.
</P>
<P>
   In other developments Thursday, Rep. Jim McCrery of Louisiana,
whom Linder named as a potential opponent, told the Associated
Press he would be interested in the NRCC job if it were vacant.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were urging Rep. Jennifer Dunn (R-Wash.), the
vice-chairwoman of the Republican conference, to run for a higher
leadership post.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn, according to one frequently heard scenario, could
challenge Rep. John Boehner (R-Ohio), the conference chairman, or
House Majority Leader Richard Armey of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. George Radanovich (R-Calif.) officially announced he would
run against Boehner.
</P>
<P>
   Linder said that, alone among top Republicans, DeLay was most
likely to escape a challenge for his post as chief vote-counter.

GREENSPAN HINTS FED'S CREDIT-SQUEEZE FEARS HAVE LESSENED 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also ECON-REPORT, MARKET) 
(mk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve,
said Thursday that investors and lenders appeared to be calming
down after the fright thrown into them by global financial turmoil,
suggesting that the central bank is less concerned than a few weeks
ago that a credit squeeze could derail the economy.
</P>
<P>
   While reassuring, Greenspan's comments were interpreted on Wall
Street to mean the Fed might see less need to cut interest rates
again at its next policy meeting Nov. 17. But the Labor
Department's inadvertent release Thursday of employment data for
October, showing that the economy was gradually slowing, reinforced
the case for a rate cut and left economists and investors once
again to sort out muddled signals about the prospects for the
nation's long expansion.
</P>
<P>
   After declining early in the day, stock prices surged, with the
Dow Jones industrial average gaining 132.33 points, to 8,915.47,
its highest level since July 30. Bond prices fell.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said the Fed was still more likely than not to trim
rates again this month. Many analysts are expecting a reduction of
a quarter-point in the federal funds target rate, to 4.75 percent,
after two quarter-point reductions in the last six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The odds slightly favor an easing at the next meeting,'' said
Bill Dudley, an economist at Goldman, Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan did not address the general economic outlook or
interest rate policy in his speech Thursday, delivered from
Washington by video conference to a meeting of the Securities
Industry Association in Florida. But while he cited some abating of
the pressures within the financial markets, Greenspan's decision to
devote much of the speech to investors' pronounced risk aversion
suggested that he continued to see it as a matter of concern.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed had cited wariness among lenders and jittery conditions
in the financial markets when explaining its last rate cut, on Oct.
15. A week earlier, Greenspan had called the development ``very
dramatic'' and suggested that the problem had not yet peaked.
</P>
<P>
   During the late summer and early fall, investors around the
world rushed away from all but the safest securities and also
demanded high levels of liquidity, or the ability to sell at an
instant's notice, a development that is ``virtually unprecedented''
and ``startling'' at a time when the economy is strong, inflation
is dormant and interest rates are not rising, Greenspan said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   That rush was set off by Russia's effective default on its
government bonds in mid-August, which led investors to conclude
that almost any investment could fall to the waves of financial
turmoil set off last year in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks the stock market has marched steadily upward
after its precipitous drop during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   More important from the Fed's perspective, there has also been
some narrowing of the gap between interest rates on U.S Treasury
bonds, the worldwide benchmark for investment safety, and bonds
issued by companies and other governments. Still, some Fed
officials and many economists said the spread remained larger than
it should be.
</P>
<P>
   Maury Harris, an economist at Paine Webber, said the difference
on Wednesday between the yield on 10-year Treasury notes and an
index of junk bond yields was 534 basis points, or hundredths of a
percentage point. That was down from 625 basis points since
mid-October but still way above the average for the first seven
months of the year of 300 basis points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is, of course, plausible that the current episode of
investor fright will dissipate, and yield spreads and liquidity
premiums will soon fall into more normal ranges,'' Greenspan said
in the speech to the Securities Industry Association. ``Indeed, we
are already seeing significant signs of some reversals.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Greenspan added, the improvement ``leaves unanswered the
question of why such episodes erupted in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   His answer was that ``when events become too complex and move
too rapidly as appears to be the case Thursday, human beings become
demonstrably less able to cope.'' In the financial world, that
leads to ``disengagement,'' he said, and ultimately to falling
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``That leaves us with the challenge: How can we harness
burgeoning international financial flows in a manner that does not
strain human evaluation capacities?'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   He argued against putting controls on international capital
flows, a strategy that is being seriously considered by developing
nations and one already adopted by Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that governments, central banks and organizations like
the International Monetary Fund were taking steps to develop
international banking standards and make sure that investors have
more financial information about the countries in which they are
investing. He said governments, in particular, had to pursue sound
policies if their financial systems were to be stable.
</P>
<P>
   But he said technology was changing the financial marketplace so
rapidly that regulators would always have trouble keeping up, and
that ultimately there would be little choice but to rely on the
market to police itself, with buyers and sellers judging what was
prudent and what was excessively risky to the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doubtless, tomorrow's complexities will dwarf even today's,''
Greenspan said. ``It is, thus, all the more important to recognize
that 21st-century financial regulation is going to increasingly
have to rely on private counterparty surveillance to achieve safety
and soundness.''

CLINTON LAWYER DECLINES OFFER OF SETTLEMENT  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL A. LEWIS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawyers for Paula Jones told the White House
Thursday that she would agree to withdraw her sexual misconduct
lawsuit against President Clinton for $950,000, but Clinton's
lawyer swiftly and firmly declined, lawyers involved in the
negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   The crisp rejection of an offer White House officials
acknowledged might have been seriously considered only weeks ago
may represent a new infusion of confidence on President Clinton's
part since the election on Tuesday. The failure of the Republican
Party to make any headway nationally after its emphasis on
Clinton's troubles has been widely interpreted as a lift for
Clinton in his impeachment confrontation with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The recent efforts to settle the Jones lawsuit, White House
officials had said, were motivated largely by a calculation that
such a gesture would help Clinton in any impeachment battle.
</P>
<P>
   It appears the White House may now be unwilling to engage in any
serious settlement talks until a federal appeals court in St. Paul
rules on whether Mrs. Jones' lawsuit should be reinstated. Her
lawsuit was dismissed last April, but her lawyers have asked the
appeals court to reinstate the case and order a trial to go
forward.
</P>
<P>
   If the appeals court, which may rule in the next two months,
decides against Mrs. Jones, Clinton might then be rid of the Jones
lawsuit without paying her anything.
</P>
<P>
   The latest round of negotiations came as Mrs. Jones' lawyers
have said they will soon be leaving the case. They have become
increasingly impatient with what they regard as her unrealistic
expectations in settlement talks, lawyers involved in the
negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's last offer was to pay Mrs. Jones $700,000 to drop the
lawsuit, in which she maintains that in 1991, when he was governor
of Arkansas, he lured her to a Little Rock hotel room and made a
crude sexual advance.

CARTER SIGNS TWO-YEAR CONTRACT WITH BRUINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Anson Carter was in the building just before 5 p.m.
Thursday. Wearing a baseball cap and carrying hockey sticks, he
quietly slipped into the Bruins locker room to get back to
business.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 minutes later, assistant general manager Mike
O'Connell, carrying papers and pen, followed Carter in to get his
signature on a two-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Carter was back on the ice, skating in the first period at
right wing on a line with center Joe Thornton and left wing Steve
Heinze.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, struck late Wednesday, put Carter back in the Bruins'
fold and sliced in half their number of free agent holdouts.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Kyle McLaren remains out, though O'Connell said there
were times in the last couple of days that the Bruins thought they
had reached a deal with him in negotiations he labeled ``bizarre.''
</P>
<P>
   The Carter deal was for $650,000 the first year, $850,000 the
second, with performance bonuses that could boost it another
$150,000, according to the Bloomberg News Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what happened was Anson started playing in the IHL and
decided it was probably not the place he wants to play and realized
that the money was OK,'' O'Connell said. ``We upped the ante a
little bit and they came down quite a bit, and basically, we met in
the middle and we gave him some incentives where he has the
opportunity to make some of that up.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell said there would be no hard feelings _ probably _ with
Carter, who had been talking about pursuing a trade if things could
not be worked out with the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see how he plays,'' O'Connell said, laughing. ``When we
first sat down with Anson, when we brought him in to talk, the
first thing we said was, `This is not a personal thing and don't
take it personally.' We told him, `You're trying to get the best
deal you can get and we're trying to get the best deal we can.
We're not going to have any hard feelings.'''
</P>
<P>
   Carter had played five games with the IHL's Utah Grizzlies,
scoring a goal with one assist. While he was out, the Bruins
started the season 4-6-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was playing center and now I've got to go back and learn
right wing again,'' Carter told NESN in an interview between the
first and second periods of Thursday night's game against Toronto
at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Carter had 16 goals and 27 assists with the Bruins in
his first full NHL season. The previous year, he came to Boston
from Washington along with Jason Allison and Jim Carey in a
megatrade for Adam Oates, Bill Ranford, and Rick Tocchet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just looking forward to getting back to the playoffs,''
Carter said. ``Last year was my first time, and it was a tremendous
feeling. The atmosphere around here was awesome. For personal
goals, I really haven't set any for myself. For the team, I want to
get back to the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell did not sound particularly optimistic about the way
the discussions with McLaren's agent, Doug Messier, have been
going. The sides talked Wednesday and again Thursday morning.
</P>

   ``We thought we had a deal done, and then all of a sudden, we
didn't have a deal done, and then we thought we had a deal done,''
O'Connell said. ``It's been a very interesting and frustrating
negotiation. It seemed we reached an agreement on a few occasions

   ``Absolutely no way,'' he said. ``If a player chooses to hold
out, he has to be aware he's not going to be paid for the time he
holds out. If we don't run our business that way, why not hold
out?''
</P>
<P>
   The situation, he said, ``is not frustrating. It's beyond
frustrating. I don't know what you'd call it. It's bizarre.''

HIV STUDY OF WOMEN RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT TREATMENT GUIDELINES 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Women infected with HIV may be at a more advanced stage of
infection and at a higher risk of developing AIDS than men with
identical results on certain blood tests, researchers are
reporting.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers suggest that official treatment guidelines, used
for both sexes even though they are based on research involving
only men, should be changed to recommend earlier treatment for
women. But other researchers have said changing treatment
guidelines at this point would be premature.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations are based on a study conducted at the Johns
Hopkins School of Public Health in Baltimore and being published
Friday in the Lancet, the British medical journal. The study's
researchers measured virus levels in the bloodstream, or ``viral
load,'' a major factor in deciding when a patient should begin
treatment with antiviral drugs. They found that at a given stage of
infection, a woman's viral load will be lower than a man's even
though her immune system has sustained just as much damage as his.
The researchers do not know why, they said. But they warned that
doctors who use the viral load as a benchmark may be misled into
thinking the woman is healthier than she really is.
</P>
<P>
   The new study adds fuel to a larger debate among AIDS experts
about the best time for people with HIV to begin taking antiviral
drugs. Combinations of those drugs have led to such stunning drops
in the death rate from AIDS that many researchers think patients
should be treated as soon as possible to suppress the virus and
prevent damage to the immune system. But other doctors, concerned
about dangerous side effects of treatment and the ability of HIV to
become drug resistant, say they think that patients who are not ill
should postpone treatment for as long as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most contentious issue now,'' said Dr. Jerome
Groopman, an AIDS expert at the Harvard Medical School. ``Do you
watch and wait, fearful that you'll burn your bridges, or do you
hit the virus early and hard? The answer now is no one knows. This
paper adds another dimension to the debate, makes it more vexing.''
</P>
<P>
   Guidelines issued this year by the United States Public Health
Service recommend starting treatment in both men and women when the
viral load climbs to 10,000 copies of HIV per milliliter of blood.
That level is generally taken as a sign that the immune system is
losing ground to the virus.
</P>
<P>
   But a viral load of 5,000 in a woman may be just as bad as a
reading of 10,000 in a man, according to today's study. A woman
with half the viral load of a man has the same risk of developing
AIDS as that man, and if the two have the same virus level, the
woman is more likely to develop AIDS, the Johns Hopkins researchers
found.
</P>
<P>
   Their conclusions were based on a study of 650 male and female
drug users who were infected with HIV Many had been research
participants since 1988, with frozen blood samples in storage that
allowed scientists to study virus levels over the years and see how
they correlated with the patients' health.
</P>
<P>
   A woman with the same viral load as a man had a 60 percent
greater risk of developing AIDS, said Dr. Homayoon Farzadegan, a
Johns Hopkins associate professor of epidemiology who directed the
study.
</P>
<P>
   ``Viral load in women is a different animal than it is in men,''
Farzadegan said in an interview. ``If you take the data from men
and apply them to women, we feel that women are going to be
undertreated, or get treatment too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers agreed that his findings were important, but
said that they thought it was premature to let the results
influence treatment guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kathryn Anastos, who studies AIDS at the Catholic Medical
Centers in Jamaica, N.Y. said, ``The study raises the question of
whether we should consider gender in establishing treatment
guidelines, but it doesn't answer the question.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be valuable to find out why virus levels differ in men
and women, Anastos said, adding:
</P>
<P>
   ``For years we wondered whether there were gender differences in
how AIDS progressed, and we went through a period in which we
thought gender did not make a difference. Now that we can see a
difference in something as concrete as the viral burden, it has to
give us more intellectual humility and make us realize we don't
really know what the virus is doing in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ruth Greenblatt, who heads an AIDS clinic for women at the
University of California at San Francisco, said, ``This will not be
the only study to find this difference in viral load.'' Greenblatt
and Anastos, with researchers at other medical centers, have
recently made similar findings that have not yet been published.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does seem like women run lower viral loads than men at the
same state of progression,'' Greenblatt said. But whether starting
treatment earlier would help those women is not known, she said,
adding, ``The way to test that would be to do a study and look for
a difference in outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Several other studies of sex differences in viral load are under
way, she said, and may help to resolve the question. In the
meantime, she said, ``I don't want to alarm women or make them feel
that the advice they're given based on viral load is somehow
inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenblatt said she handled the uncertainty by discussing it
with her patients and letting them decide when to begin treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we don't know and the experts don't agree,'' she said,
``my job is to explain it to patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases, said, ``I really would not go so far as to
say you need to modify the guidelines for women.'' But Fauci said
he would take the findings into consideration in treating female
patients, and would let them know that in women with lower viral
loads, HIV infection might progress at a rate comparable to that in
men with higher levels. Then, he said, he would try to help
patients work through the pros and cons of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Anastos said she hoped that eventually a better understanding of
the differences in HIV infection in men and women would lead to a
better understanding of the disease and improved treatment.

HEAD OF IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY ASKS CLINTON WHETHER HE LIED UNDER
OATH 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: 2nd take is scheduled to move at 9:30 p.m. ET) 
(sw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Forging ahead with an impeachment inquiry that most
Americans say Congress should drop, Rep. Henry Hyde on Thursday
asked President Clinton to say flatly whether he lied under oath,
tampered with witnesses, or obstructed justice.
</P>
<P>
   In a nine-page letter, Hyde, chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, asked Clinton to admit or deny 81 selected findings
gleaned from the Whitewater independent counsel's 445-page report
on the president's affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The Illinois Republican said the president could speed the
process along by not disputing the findings. But many of the
questions are pointed and ask Clinton to admit to accusations that
the president and his advisers have strenuously denied since the
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, sent his scathing report to
Congress. Take question No. 21, for instance:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you admit or deny that you gave false and misleading
testimony under oath when you stated during your deposition in the
case of Jones v. Clinton on January 17, 1998, that you did not know
if Monica Lewinsky had been subpoenaed to testify in that case?''
</P>
<P>
   Answering ``yes'' to questions like this, Hyde said, would help
him wrap up the inquiry by year's end. ``The cooperation we'd like
is to admit facts that are already, we think, established in the
record. That gets us from here to there rather quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers declined to comment Thursday night on Hyde's
letter, but they are certain to balk at many of the conclusions
drawn straight from Starr's report that they consider woefully
biased.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``At the appropriate time, in the appropriate way, we will say
whatever we intend to say,'' Clinton told reporters during a
meeting with Democratic congressional leaders at the White House.
``The important thing is that we've got to get back to doing the
people's business.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Chicago, Hyde described the letter to
Clinton as he outlined the schedule for the inquiry against
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde on Thursday underscored his goal to wrap up the inquiry by
year's end, announcing that the committee would likely summon only
one witness, Starr, on Nov. 19.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the shock waves from Democratic gains in midterm elections
have injected new doubts and uncertainty into the impeachment
process, lawmakers said on Thursday. And any alternative to
impeachment, such as censure, has been complicated by the
leadership fight that has broken out among House Republicans in
recriminations over Tuesday's debacle.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said on Thursday that the election would have ``no
significant impact'' on the impeachment proceedings. &QL;

MICROSOFT MAKES ANOTHER TRY AT PROFESSORS' DOCUMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Microsoft Corp. went to federal appeals court in Boston
Thursday to overturn a lower court ruling that the software giant
says would hurt its defense against a landmark antitrust suit.
</P>
<P>
   The Redmond, Wash. company is seeking documents and tapes of
interviews two business professors _ from Harvard and MIT _
conducted for their book on Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft wants to review the outtakes in case they could help
the company defend against the ongoing antitrust case brought by
the U.S. Justice Department and a group of states, which alleges
that Microsoft used its large market share in computer operating
systems to bully Netscape and other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard and MIT say Microsoft's demand for the material violates
academic freedom and First Amendment principles, and the schools
last month won a ruling in federal district court that denied
Microsoft access to the materials in most cases.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft appealed that decision to the US Court of Appeals'
First Circuit, where a three-judge panel Thursday heard lawyers for
the two sides reiterate their arguments. No appellate decision is
expected for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The two professors, David Yoffie of Harvard Business School and
Michael Cusumano at MIT's Sloan School of Management, spoke at
length with Netscape executives about their difficulties in
bringing new products to market for their new book, ``Competing On
Internet Time: Lessons From Netscape And Its Battle With
Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   In a filing to the appeals court, Microsoft's lawyers wrote that
the book ``contains extensive quotations from Netscape personnel
that eviscerate the DOJ's and States' claim.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the government's main allegation sis that Microsoft used
its clout in computer operating systems to improperly dominate the
market for programs used to browse the World Wide Web, such as
Netscape's Navigator software. But according to Microsoft's
appellate brief, the professsors' book describes interviews in
which ``Netscape personnel candidly concede that many of Netscape's
problems are of its own creation, and not the result of any
allegedly anti-competitive actions taken by Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   In rebuttal, attorneys for each school repeated their claim that
complying with Microsoft's demands would ruin the ability of
academics to conduct research.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they said, the professors made oral agreements with
Netscape executives to keep sensitive material out of the public
domain. Such agreements, the schools argue, were the only way for
the professors to gain the cooperation of Netscape executives.
</P>
<P>
   Yoffie's attorney, Jonathan Albano of Bingham Dana LLP, told a
three-judge panel that the professor's arrangments with Netscape
executives called for them to be allowed to review the book before
it was published, and also ``to object if they didn't wish to be
quoted.''
</P>
<P>
   But Judge Frank Coffin pressed for more detail on this point,
asking if the authors kept the final decision about what material
to use.
</P>
<P>
   Albano replied that the professors ``would be breaking their
word'' to their sources if they did so.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview after the hearing, Yoffie said his arrangements
with executives at Netscape actually called for sources to
``negotiate'' over just what material might be used.
</P>
<P>
   Without such arragments to put interview subjects at ease, said
Yoffie, who attended the hearing, ``I'd never be able to do another
book.'' In fact, he said, most other faculty members at the school
conduct their research under similar guidelines, as do professors
at MIT.
</P>
<P>
   Appellate Judge Bruce Selya said the court would try to decide
the case ``in time to be useful'' for Microsoft's pending defense
against the government's action, now pending in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft shares rose 7/8 Thursday to close at 106 3/8.

AT&AMP;T'S ARMSTRONG HITS BELL ATLANTIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ AT&AMP;T Corp. chairman C. Michael Armstrong has
challenged &UR;  &LR; Bell Atlantic Corp.'s claim that it has opened its
local phone monopoly to competition.
</P>
<P>
   The AT&AMP;T chief added that he will testify in Washington against
the proposed Bell Atlantic-GTE Corp. merger.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking Thursday at the Boston Harbor Hotel before the Boston
College Chief Executives Club, Armstrong said Bell Atlantic's
recent attempts to open the New York local telephone market to
rivals such as AT&AMP;T was fraught with problems. These included
missed deadlines for connecting customers and prematurely cutting
off dial tones for some customers switching away from Bell
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   He claimed Bell Atlantic has been late 85 percent of the time in
providing AT&AMP;T with confirmation that a customer wants to switch
service. And Bell Atlantic has been consistently unable to meet the
industry standard of switching customers to another provider within
five days, Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1996 Telecommunications Act, the Bell regional
telephone companies must open their local markets to competitors.
Once state and federal regulators agree that the local phone
monopoly no longer exists and that customers can speedily obtain
and switch service from one provider to another, the regional phone
companies will be allowed to &UR;  &LR; enter the long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the first state where Bell Atlantic is working to
provide competitive access, Armstrong said it is doing poorly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't ascribe any evil motives to Bell Atlantic,''
said Armstrong. ``But it seems pretty clear that they don't have
the systems and procedures in place to get this important job done.
And that's intolerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's comments came one day after Bell Atlantic chief
executive &UR;  &LR; Ivan Seidenberg told analysts the company will win
Federal Communications Commission approval to offer long-distance
service in New York during the first quarter of next year.
Seidenberg also said Bell Atlantic plans to seek FCC permission
next year to offer long-distance service in Massachusetts and
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Bell Atlantic Thursday disputed Armstrong's claims. ``This is
just another attempt by AT&AMP;T and other large long-distance
companies to delay the process of Bell Atlantic gaining approval to
enter the long-distance market,'' said Bell Atlantic spokesman Jack
Hoey.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong also asserted that a wave of telecommunications
mergers are anticompetitive. Bell Atlantic and GTE have agreed to
combine, as have &UR;  &LR; SBC Communications Corp. and Ameritech.

<P>
   HOUSTON _ The crew of the space shuttle Discovery spent much of
day seven of its nine-day flight speaking jocularly to journalists,
students and Vice President Al Gore. The crew members said they
were healthy, sleeping well and meeting a rigorous schedule for
scientific experiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot to do, and many thought we would not be able to
do it all in nine days,'' said Pedro Duque, one of the crew, which
has been carrying out 83 experiments, an unusually ambitious
program. ``So far we have been on schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   On a television linkup to the space shuttle from Washington,
Gore called the shuttle flight ``an unqualified success.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Scott Parazynski, a medical doctor, said he and the six
other Discovery crew members had been ``exceptionally healthy.''
The evaluation applied to John Glenn, who at 77 is the oldest
person to fly in space.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has been active, eating well and has had no problem
with motion sickness whatsoever,'' Parazynski said in a news
conference beamed from space with journalists asking questions from
the Johnson Space Center here.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Glenn said he was surprised he had escaped the space
sickness that affects most people who fly in space.
</P>
<P>
   The crew may be the first to have avoided motion sickness in
space.
</P>
<P>
   Most space fliers have experienced varying degrees of nausea,
vomiting or other symptoms of motion sickness, said Ed Campion, a
spokesman for NASA. About 70 percent of men and 50 percent of women
have experienced such symptoms, Campion said. The condition usually
occurs within the first days of space flight.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Charles, a NASA medical specialist, said in an
interview that his agency had often discussed motion sickness at
meetings. But, Charles added, he could not recall reports from such
meetings of another crew that had escaped motion sickness in space.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are conducting sleep experiments on the mission. And
to try to improve the quality of sleep in space and reduce the
fatigue most astronauts experience on return to earth, the crew has
been instructed to retire from 30 to 45 minutes earlier each night
of the flight.
</P>
<P>
   Curt Brown, the shuttle flight commander, said he ``usually has
no problem sleeping, no matter where I am.'' But, Brown added,
going to sleep earlier each night ``affects your sleep pattern a
little bit, so it is getting a little tougher to stay asleep for
the entire'' night.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn was dropped from one top priority sleep experiment that
involved taking a small amount of the hormone melatonin. He was
excluded because he had a pre-existing condition that made him
ineligible for it. Asked why he did not know he was ineligible when
he agreed to participate in the study after it was explained to
him, Glenn said he did ``not think this is the time to get into
that.''
</P>
<P>
   NASA had listed the melatonin experiment as a top priority of
the flight, which costs nearly half a billion dollars. Today, Glenn
played down the melatonin study, saying, ``It was such a small part
of the whole experiment, to me it was very insignificant.''
</P>
<P>
   The crew began packing up equipment used in some experiments
aboard the Discovery, which is due to land in Florida on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But Charles said that ``the mission is not over when the wheels
stop rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn and other crew members will continue to participate in
sleep, balance, metabolism and other studies for weeks after the
flight so scientists can compare the findings before, during and
after space flight.
</P>
<P>
   Because scientists are allowed one year from the final study
session before reporting findings to NASA, it will be some time
before final analyses are available, Charles said.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's wife, Annie, who had earlier objected to her husband's
return to space, said at a separate news conference that she was
``scared'' at the launching last week. ``I will feel a whole lot
better when he is back on Earth,'' she said.

WOODWARD LAWYERS SEEK REVIEW OF DAMAGE ISSUE IN CIVIL SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Lawyers for British au pair Louise Woodward concede
that she is responsible for the death of eight-month-old Matthew
Eappen, but they are challenging the scope of the damages that can
be paid to his parents.
</P>
<P>
   After ignoring the wrongful death suit brought against Woodward
for more than four months, her newly-hired lawyers succeeded
Thursday in convincing a federal judge to reconsider the damages
issue.
</P>
<P>
   The &UR;  &LR; end result could be that a jury, not a judge, decides just
how much money the Eappens should get.
</P>
<P>
   US District Judge William G. Young said he would permit
Woodward's new lawyers, John P. Ryan and Myles W. McDonough, to
argue at a hearing Nov. 19 that the Eappens are not entitled to
punitive damages from Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Woodward's lawyers said they were ``tabling''
a request that Young lift the injunction barring Woodward from
spending any money she gets from selling her story.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that his firm's appearance in the case was
``11th hour,'' Ryan said Woodward did not become aware of
``possible alternative sources to help her defend herself in the
United States'' until late September.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan would not be more specific, but made references in court to
``carriers,'' presumably meaning insurance carriers. And his firm,
Sloane and Walsh, is known for its insurance defense work.
</P>
<P>
   But Ryan said his firm ``is not the insurance counsel...We're
representing Miss Woodward.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for EF Au Pair, the agency that spent $750,000
defending Woodward in her criminal trial, referred questions about
EF's involvement in the case to attorney Norman Jacobs of the
Boston law firm of Esdaile Barrett &AMP; Esdaile, saying ``it's not an
EF issue, it's an insurance issue.'' Jacobs did not return a phone
message seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, Ryan insisted that Woodward did not want the
injunction lifted that prohibits her from profiting from her story
so that she can be free to make money.
</P>
<P>
   ``This hearing was not for the purpose of releasing Miss
Woodward to go out and sell a story and profit, which is the way
I've seen this characterized, and I think that's regrettable,''
Ryan said. ``She has a right to be heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Both inside and outside the courtroom, the Eappens' lawyer,
Fredric L. Ellis, angrily challenged Woodward's claim that she had
no financial means to defend the lawsuit until recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason why the court should bend over backwards to
give her any relief at this point,'' Ellis said afterward. He told
Young he wanted to see an affidavit from Woodward swearing that she
had no money in July, when Young entered a default judgment because
Woodward had not responded to the suit in any way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe it,'' Ellis said, noting that Woodward got
$60,000 from a British tabloid, had money in her defense fund and
bought a new car. ``She could have used that for her defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue before Young in two weeks will be whether the Eappens
are entitled to punitive damages in addition to compensatory
damages. Woodward's lawyers say they are not, based on Middlesex
Superior Court Judge Hiller Zobel's finding in November 1997 that
Woodward acted out of ``confusion, fright and bad judgment, rather
than rage or malice'' when she fatally shook Matthew Eappen.
</P>
<P>
   To award punitive damages on top of compensatory damages, there
must be evidence of ``willful, wanton or reckless conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's lawyers said they wanted a full evidentiary hearing
on their claim that Woodward's conduct was not reckless, which
would require testimony. If that were the case, Ellis said, ``I'd
prefer to have a jury sitting in that box while we do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said he was not reluctant to go to trial. ``There is no
issue of liability,'' he said. ``The issue is how much the damages
are going to be. If he removes the default judgment we'll have a
jury determine that instead of a judge.''

MITCH AFTERMATH HEIGHTENS US-HONDURAN TENSIONS

<P>
   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras _ Cardinal Bernard Law flew from Boston to
Honduras Thursday morning to see the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch,
but ended up stepping into a political storm between the United
States and Honduras over aid.
</P>
<P>
   Law arrived as tensions were rising between Honduras and its
longtime partner, the United States. This week, President Carlos
Roberto Flores and other officials have complained that Washington
has been slow to recognize the extent of the disaster in Honduras,
reluctant to commit American aircraft for rescue missions, and
stingy with its initial offers of aid.
</P>
<P>
   The officials also said that Washington at first paid more
attention to Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala, which suffered
less damage, but that have well-organized exile communities in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday afternoon, Law joined US Ambassador James F. Creagan at
the presidential palace in Tegucigalpa. What was to have been a
routine meeting turned into a less-than-diplomatic discussion
between the ambassador and the president, as Law played the role of
peacemaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to ask President Clinton to get a helicopter here
because the Ambassador needed 48 hours of notice to do that,''
Flores said in Spanish to Law and a small group of Boston Catholic
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   President Flores laughed. The ambassador laughed, but did not
look very pleased. Law broke the ice. ``Our president has all the
power,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 6,000 dead and 4,600 missing, Honduras has been
the worst-hit of the Central American nations slammed by Hurricane
Mitch for days last week.
</P>
<P>
   The overall death toll now tops 10,000, as Nicaragua revised its
count upwards to 4,000. El Salvador reported 239 dead; Guatemala,
194. Six people died in southern Mexico and seven in Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   Flores told reporters in another meeting that Mitch destroyed
more than 60 percent of the country's infrastructure, setting back
development by 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Ministry, concerned that crowded shelter conditions
could produce outbreaks of hepatitis, respiratory infections and
other ailments, announced an inoculation campaign, especially for
children.
</P>
<P>
   During the more than hour-long meeting in the president's
private office, Flores obliquely criticized the United States
several times while Ambassador Creagan referred to specific aid
projects that Washington is funding.
</P>
<P>
   Flores noted that Mexico's health minister has promised to
donate medicine, the government of France has sent experts to fix
water systems that supply the capital but Honduras is still stumped
as it tries to repair more than 100 bridges torn apart by surging
waters. ``Isn't there something you can do?'' Flores said to
Creagan.
</P>
<P>
   Creagan pointed out that US Army Corps of Engineers already is
trying to come up with replacements for a bridge that links
Tegucigalpa, the capital, to a port city. The ambassador also
mentioned that Washington has committed $500,00 to help Honduras
with its water problem.
</P>
<P>
   Law is the first religious leader from abroad to visit Honduras
since the hurricane swept through. He came to deliver a $100,000
check from the Archdiose of Boston and to promise food, medicines,
clothing and more money. He also came to remind Americans and
others that although the high waters are receding in Central
America, the broken families need to be healed, the lost jobs
replaced, the splintered houses and teetering bridges repaired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply by his presence, the Cardinal shows solidarity with the
Honduran people,'' said Msgr. Peter Conley, editor of the Boston
Pilot. ``Hopefully, he will be able to sharpen awareness at home
about the situation here.''
</P>
<P>
   Law, who was born in Mexico and raised in Panama and other
countries has an easy relationship with several Central American
religious and political leaders. He will fly to Nicaragua Friday
morning to assess the storm's damage and deliver a $100,000 check
to the Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the week, Ambassador Creagan presented
Honduras with $125,000 in emergency aid. By Wednesday night,
Washington had committed 700 tons of food, 11 tons of medicine, as
well as cargo planes filled with fuel, building supplies and
military transportation.
</P>
<P>
   But Flores pronounced the aid to Honduras ``modest.'' In an
interview with reporters on Wednesday, Moises Starkman, who directs
the Ministry of Technical Cooperation, said: ``The United States
government is helping us, but they could do more.''
</P>
<P>
   Politicians and TV commentators have lavished praise on Mexico,
which loaned Honduras 12 helicopters for rescue missions. US
officials were irritated, especially when the helicopters arrived
with no fuel and Honduras quietly asked Washington to fill up the
tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions increased when the Honduran military, which is
overseeing the relief flights criss-crossing the country,
complained that the Pentagon was slow to put American helicopters
and C-130 Hercules cargo planes to use.
</P>
<P>
   US officials said that Pentagon aircraft can only land on safe
air strips, that pilots must rest a certain number of hours, and
that aircraft must follow a strict maintenance schedule. The US
officials testily said that Honduran military planes are not being
maintained correctly.
</P>
<P>
   US officials are especially angry because they have told
Honduras that Washington is preparing an extensive plan for
long-term rebuilding projects, not just immediate humanitarian
relief. The US embassy is abuzz with rumors that someone _ probably
former President George Bush _ will be invited to visit Honduras to
highlight America's concern.
</P>
<P>
   During Thursday's meeting, President Flores spoke warmly to Law,
who was joined by a joint delegation from Boston: his secretary,
Msgr Paul McInerny; Dr. Michael Collins, president of Caritas
Christi, Joseph Doolin, director of Catholic Charities; and Conley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready to participate in any way we can,'' Law assured
the president.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the ambassador started to talk about the millions
of dollars in aid that the United States has promised Honduras. The
president interrupted: ``Let's not talk about millions,'' he said.
``There are several things we would like.''
</P>
<P>
   He leaned toward Law, saying that, more than any aid, Honduras
wants to be included in a free-trade agreement with the United
States. Speaking gently, in Spanish, Law promised to talk to
members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The ambassador, who has often spoken in favor of a increased
free trade with Honduras, was left to nod and offer his support.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Pushing the frontiers of biology closer to the central mystery
of life, scientists have for the first time picked out and
cultivated the primordial human cells from which an entire
individual is created.
</P>
<P>
   The cells, derived from fertilized human eggs just before they
would have implanted in the uterus, have the power to develop into
many of the 210 different types of cell in the body _ and probably
all of them. Because they can divide indefinitely in culture
without the signs of age that afflict other cells, biologists refer
to them as immortal.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, researchers hope to use the cells to grow tissue for
human transplants or to introduce new or improved genes into
people.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a thicket of ethical and legal issues, as well as
technical problems, to be overcome. The cells are obtained from
embryos created at in vitro fertilization clinics and so far do not
seem definably different from the primordial cells from which an
entire individual is created.
</P>
<P>
   Though some of the scientists involved in the work see nothing
unusual about working with these cells, other researchers say they
must be treated differently, given their human potential. Once the
work becomes widely known, it may draw criticism from those who say
it is wrong to interfere with nature by doing any kind of research
on cells like these.
</P>
<P>
   Known as human embryonic stem cells, they have eluded capture
until now because they exist in this state only fleetingly before
turning into more specialized cells, and need special ingredients
to be kept alive outside the body.
</P>
<P>
   The new cells have many possible uses of which the most
promising is to grow new tissue, of any kind, for transplant into a
patient's body. The cells may also offer effective routes to human
cloning, although both the researchers and their sponsor deny any
interest in this application. Another likely use is in gene
therapy, the insertion of new or modified genes into body tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Two forms of human embryonic cells have been developed, one by a
team under Dr. James A. Thomson of the University of Wisconsin in
Madison, the other by Dr. John Gearhart and colleagues at the Johns
Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Md. Thomson's
work is reported in this week's issue of Science, and Gearhart's in
the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Congress in 1995 banned federal financing of research on fetal
cells, including those derived from embryos, and the university
researchers whose work was announced today were funded by the Geron
Corporation of Menlo Park, Calif., a biotechnology company that
specializes in anti-aging research.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has potential health benefits which I think are extremely
promising, and I am sorry that the law prevented us from supporting
it,'' said Dr. Harold Varmus, director of the National Institutes
of Health.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After an egg is fertilized it divides several times and forms a
blastocyst, a hollow sphere with a blob of 15 to 20 cells, known as
the inner cell mass, piled up against one wall. It is from these
cells that the embryo develops. Thomson grew his embryonic stem
cells from the inner cell mass of blastocysts left over from a
fertility treatment and due to be discarded. Patients who had
undergone fertility treatment donated the blastocysts to be used in
research.
</P>
<P>
   As an embryo grows and develops its cells become irreversibly
committed to their fates as specialized components of the body's
organs. A pocket of cells, known as embryonic germ cells, is
protected from the commitment process so as to create the next
generation of eggs and sperm.
</P>
<P>
   Gearhart's group has developed embryonic stem cells from the
germ cells of aborted fetuses. The cells developed by the two
groups may well be equivalent but this has yet to be proved.
</P>
<P>
   If researchers are able to use the cells to grow new tissues,
the work could alleviate the shortage of livers and other organs
for transplant. Cultures of the cells in the laboratory could be
nudged down different developmental pathways to become heart or
bone marrow or pancreatic cells. Before reaching their final
stages, the about-to-become heart cells, for example, could be
injected into a patient's ailing heart. Guided then by the body's
own internal regulatory signals, the cells would develop into new,
young heart tissue, supplementing or replacing the heart cells
already there.
</P>
<P>
   The same approach should in principle work with any tissue of
the body. Human embryonic stem cells would thus serve as a
universal spare parts system. Because the cells grow and divide
indefinitely in culture, very few blastocysts would be needed.
</P>
<P>
   Many technical problems remain to be resolved. The art of
directing embryonic stem cells down specific pathways is in its
infancy. But heart muscle cells have been grown from mouse
embryonic stem cells and successfully integrated with the heart
tissue of a living mouse. Thomson in 1995 isolated the embryonic
stem cells of a monkey, and Geron intends to do pilot experiments
in these cells.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem lies in making grafted cells compatible with the
patient's immune system. Dr. Thomas B. Okarma, Geron's vice
president for research, said Geron would explore several ways of
doing this. One, the least preferred, would be to set up a bank
with enough different human embryonic cells that most patients
could be matched. Another would be to suppress the self-recognition
genes that make the stem cells appear foreign to the patient's
immune system or, more elegantly, to replace them with copies of
the patient's own self-recognition genes.
</P>
<P>
   A third approach would be to convert one of the patient's own
body cells back to embryonic form by fusing it with a human
embryonic stem cell whose own nucleus had been removed. Embryonic
cells may have the power, not yet understood, to rescue an adult
cell's nucleus from its specialized state by flicking all the
switches on its DNA back to default mode. This reprogramming of DNA
is presumably what happened when mice were cloned this July from
adult cells.
</P>
<P>
   The ethical status of the cells is also likely to be a matter of
discussion. They cannot become a fetus, as their blastocyst no
longer exists, yet are very similar, if not identical, to the 20 or
so primordial cells from which the embryo develops.
</P>
<P>
   Both research groups refer to their cells as ``pluripotent''
because, when injected into a mouse with no immune system the cells
develop into many of the major tissues of the body. The tissues are
disorganized and do not develop into a normal embryo.
</P>
<P>
   The cells may also be ``totipotent,'' meaning they can form
every one of the body's cell types, but the experiment to prove
this point would be unethical. The test for totipotency, developed
with mouse embryonic stem cells, would involve injecting stem cells
into another blastocyst. A normal mouse will usually develop but is
composed of a patchwork of cells, some from the blastocyst, some
from the injected embryonic stem cells, proving the stem cells
retain all their powers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It would be unethical to perform such an experiment on people
but if it could be done, it seems likely that the human embryonic
cells cultured by the researchers would also prove to be
totipotent. If so, they might be capable in principle of
contributing to the generation of a new individual.
</P>
<P>
   But ethicists say great care must be taken in work involving
human embryonic cells. ``Any time you take a cell off a blastocyst,
that cell could be used itself to create a human being, so some
groups in our society believe that in making it transplantable you
have derailed it into becoming a kidney or some other tissue,''
said Dr. Lori Andrews of the Chicago-Kent College of Law, an expert
on the laws governing reproductive technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some researchers say `It's just a bunch of cells, why should
people care?' But that totally avoids the fact that some people do
care, and I'm concerned that if the researchers don't take into
consideration the variety of viewpoints about embryos they might
ultimately end up with more restrictive regulations,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Geron, which obtained the exclusive rights to make use of the
cells from the researchers' universities, which hold patents on the
processes, says it regards them as qualitatively different from
other cells used in research. ``Because these cells are derived
from human blastocysts there is a moral authority here, so we take
these cells seriously,'' said Okarma of Geron.
</P>
<P>
   He believes that use of the cells is justified because they are
something less than a living embryo and life-saving treatments may
be derived from them. ``We are not saying the ends justify the
means, but that given that the moral authority of these cells is
subordinate to that of the embryo, the work we contemplate with
them is appropriate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gearhart said he did not consider the cells that he and
Thomson have isolated to have a special moral status because ``they
cannot form a fetus _ you cannot take one of these cells and form a
being out of it.'' Still, he said he would not argue with Okarma's
view that the cells had a different standing to ordinary cells.
Johnson, too, said that they were ``special cells.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kevin T. Fitzgerald, a geneticist and Jesuit priest at
Loyola University Medical School, said that if the human stem cells
are totipotent, ``then you are disputing the viability of life, and
we are back to the question of how to justify destroying life for
the purposes of scientific advancement.''
</P>
<P>
   The new cells may well reawaken fears of human cloning, although
many ethicists have now come around to believing that the public's
fears, despite science fiction writers' portrayal of clonal armies
of frenzied despots, are largely beside the point. Many experts now
predict human cloning is more likely to end up as a rare treatment
offered in fertility clinics, no different from the others like in
vitro fertilization and egg donation in that they were first
bitterly denounced and are now regarded as routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human cloning will likely also be accepted once it becomes a
reality. Most of today's ethical arguments against it were
previously used against in vitro fertilization and turned out to be
false,'' writes Dorothy C. Wertz, a bioethicist at the Shriver
Center, in the current issue of Gene Letter.
</P>
<P>
   The availability of human embryonic stem cells suggests a quite
different possibility to biologists, who are well aware of how
mouse embryonic stem cells have long been used to generate
genetically altered mice. The belief that humans can now be
modified like mice ``will be the knee-jerk reaction of the academic
community,'' Thomson said.
</P>
<P>
   He said human embryonic stem cells were unlikely to be used in
this way because there were more promising approaches for gene
therapy in people. For one thing, the mouse method requires the
creation of many embryos in order to obtain the few in which new
genes integrate in exactly the correct position, as well as the
breeding of a male and female mouse that have been genetically
altered. In its present form the technique is evidently
inapplicable to humans.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The National Institutes of Health and the university scientists
it funds often play a leading role in reviewing new biomedical
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   But because of the Federal funding ban, university scientists
cannot get government support to study human embryonic stem cells.
But industry can do whatever research it pleases, without
necessarily obtaining government approval. Academic biologists
believe this asymmetry is unfortunate and that the new technique
would receive better and more detached review if the N.I.H and its
scientists could take part in the discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Varmus said that an expert panel on human embryo research had
recommended to the NIH that attempts to derive stem cells from
human embryos should be permitted, but Federal efforts along this
line were thwarted in 1995, with the Congressional funding ban.
Varmus said he believed the public ``will see how important the
benefits of this research might be.''
</P>
<P>
   A Senate bill to ban human cloning was defeated in February, the
principal argument of its opponents being that its overly broad
language would prohibit promising research on human embryonic stem
cells.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, any ultimate use of human embryonic stem cells may
face legal hurdles in the nine states that have outright bans on
research on human fetal tissues, Andrews said.
</P>
<P>
   Some laws also prohibit payment for embryos, a restriction that
might extend to cell lines and tissues derived from embryos.
</P>
<P>
   The technique reaches to the central mysteries of life and
death. As biologists have recently begun to understand, the body's
cells are not inherently mortal. They become mortal only when
committed to developing into one or another of the body's mature
cell types. These specialized cells have mostly lost the ability to
grow and divide but a few, typically those of the skin and
intestinal lining, can divide in culture about 50 times and then
die.
</P>
<P>
   In January, biologists at Geron learned how to manipulate the
section of DNA that marks off the 50 or so permissible divisions.
By reversing the changes in this section of DNA, called the
telomere, they created lines of cells that divided well beyond the
usual limit and are still going strong, while retaining their
youthful vigor and appearance. Biologists refer to these cultured
cells as immortal because they are expected to grow and divide
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Embyronic stem cells are also immortal because, until they
become committed to specialized fates, their telomeres are renewed
each time they divide. Unlike ordinary cells, they grow
indefinitely in culture.
</P>
<P>
   In the lineage of living organisms, they cycle indefinitely from
the embryo to the germ line to a new embryo.
</P>
<P>
   Geron biologists believe they can manipulate the telomeres of
the human embryonic stem cells so that the cells stay immortal even
as they turn into specialized tissues. Can the mortal body
therefore be repaired with new, tissues that remain youthful
indefinitely? ``Exactly,'' Okarma said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have said it would be folly to tamper with the telomere
division-counting system because it probably arose in evolution as
the body's last-ditch defense against any run-away cell likely to
become a cancer. Okarma said that new experiments had largely laid
this concern to rest by showing that telomerised cells are no more
likely to become malignant than are normal cells.
</P>
<P>
   These grand schemes may or may not come to pass, but the
techniques now at hand for manipulating human embryonic stem cells
will at least allow them to be seriously attempted.

LAWYERS OFFER ARGUMENTS ON DETENTION OF PINOCHET 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CASTRO-PINOCHET)

 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Lawyers who are seeking to overturn a High Court ruling
made last week that granted Gen. Augusto Pinochet freedom from
arrest argued Thursday that legal decisions around the world had
long denied people charged with crimes like genocide and torture
the protection of sovereign immunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Concepts of crimes against humanity including torture and
hostage taking were established in international law before the
military regime took power in Chile in 1973,'' said Christopher
Greenwood, a lawyer for the Crown Prosecution Service.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwood represents the Spanish authorities who have brought
charges of mass murder against Pinochet, the former Chilean
dictator.
</P>
<P>
   Such crimes fall within ``universal jurisdiction,'' he said, and
could be tried by national courts regardless of the nationality of
the person charged or where the abuses occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwood cited inquiries and tribunals that had judged
atrocities committed as long ago as World War I and as recently as
in the conflicts in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia to argue his
point that people who had committed crimes even ``under the color
of authority'' could not avoid prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, another lawyer, Alun Jones, had argued that there was
an inherent contradiction in providing immunity to people charged
with genocide. ``It is almost in the nature of genocide that it
tends to be committed by people in positions of power and holding
offices of state,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The High Court ruled a week ago that Pinochet, 82, is immune
from arrest and prosecution because he was head of state when the
crimes that he is charged with were committed.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested here on Oct. 16 on a request from Baltasar
Garzon, a Spanish magistrate who is investigating atrocities in the
``dirty wars'' in Latin America in the 1970s and '80s. The Spanish
authorities hold Pinochet responsible for the deaths of more than
3,000 people, including Spaniards, Britons, Chileans and other
Latin Americans.
</P>
<P>
   He is under police guard at a secluded hospital in North London,
recovering from back surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The setting Thursday, the second day of the hearing, was a
genteel one for a discussion of genocide, torture and crimes
against humanity. The lawyers were dressed in wigs, high collars
and black robes, and addressed the judges as ``your lordships'' and
one another as ``my learned friend.'' The case is being heard by a
five-member panel of the Lords of Appeal, the highest court in
England, in a plain committee room off a Gothic inner court of the
senior chamber of the Parliament.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Law Lords were unable to complete the hearings Thursday as
they had hoped, and the appeal will resume on Monday. The afternoon
session concluded with the beginning of a presentation by Prof. Ian
Brownlie, an expert on international law. He has argued on behalf
of Amnesty International; the Redress Trust; the Medical Foundation
for the Care of Victims of Torture; the two sisters of William
Beausire, an Anglo-Chilean who ``disappeared'' during the Pinochet
government; and Dr. Sheila Cassidy, a British doctor who was
tortured in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   If the Law Lords rule in the general's favor he could leave the
country at once, and separate moves by Chilean exiles in Europe and
by other European governments to seek his extradition to Belgium,
France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Sweden and Switzerland would

HOUSE GOP SHRINKS IMPEACHMENT EFFORT; STARR TO TESTIFY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans, stung by an election backlash,
abruptly abandoned plans Thursday for a full-scale impeachment
inquiry and asked President Clinton to admit in a sworn affidavit
to numerous allegations stemming from his affair with former White
House intern Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Moving to hasten the impeachment probe after Election Day polls
showed broad public hunger for a swift resolution, the House
Judiciary Committee asked Clinton to help ``expedite the inquiry''
by responding under oath to 81 written questions related to charges
that he committed perjury, tampered with witnesses, obstructed
justice and abused the power of his office in trying to cover up
his 16-month affair with Lewinsky in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Notable among the questions: ``Do you admit or deny that you
made a false and misleading public statement ... on January 26,
1998, when you stated, `But I want to say one thing to the American
people ... I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Ms.
Lewinsky?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The White House had no immediate comment on Hyde's 10-page
document.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing plans to dramatically scale back the inquiry,
Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry J. Hyde said the panel also
expects to call only one major witness _ independent counsel
Kenneth W. Starr _ before recommending whether to remove Clinton
from office.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, whose $4 million, eight-month investigation of the affair
has made him a lightning rod for criticism among the president's
supporters, is scheduled to testify before the committee on Nov.
19.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have long sought to cross-examine Starr over the
Lewinsky investigation and his $40 million, four-year inquiry into
other allegations related to Clinton and White House operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans calling Starr as their only witness is
something of a Hail Mary pass,'' said Representative Martin T.
Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat who serves on the Judiciary
Committee. ``They hope he is going to be as compelling as Oliver
North was in the Iran-Contra hearings. We're going to have to get
organized and see what issues to explore.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Starr said, ``The judge will be helpful and
cooperative with Congress.'' She declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
   In paring down the investigation, GOP leaders effectively ceded
to Democratic demands to expedite the process and risked inciting
the wrath of House conservatives who favor a comprehensive probe
into as many as 15 allegations that Clinton may have committed
impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, in a news conference outside Chicago, said politics played
no role in his abandoning a full-scale investigation. The inquiry
could have included appearances by Lewinsky and a parade of other
controversial witnesses in nationally televised hearings.
</P>
<P>
   But Hyde acknowledged the growing urgency to resolve the
presidential crisis. ``No one knows more than I do that the public
wants us to end this matter as soon as possible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The only other witness Hyde is expected to call before the
committee is a legal specialist, to testify about the subject of
sworn testimony, an issue Starr and Clinton's lawyers have
disputed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, asked at the White House to comment on Hyde's plans to
scale back the hearings, alluded to the election results. ``The
American people sent us a message that would break the eardrums of
anyone who was listening,'' he said. ``They want their business
tended to. They are tired of seeing Washington focused on politics
and personalities.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart described Hyde's plan
for a scaleback as ``a positive development.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Hyde's 81 questions to the president relate to
allegations that Clinton engaged in an elaborate attempt to conceal
his sexual trysts with Lewinsky near the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you admit or deny that on or about October 11, 1997, you
met with Monica Lewinsky in or about the Oval Office dining room?''
Clinton is asked in question No. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the questions refer to Clinton's alleged role in helping
Lewinsky find a job in New York when she was subpoenaed in the
sexual harassment lawsuit brought against Clinton by Paula Corbin
Jones. Starr cited the allegation as possible witness tampering and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Many other questions relate to alleged perjury that Clinton
committed in a deposition in the Jones case and in videotaped
testimony for Starr before a federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Among the questions: ``Do you admit or deny that you gave false
and misleading testimony under oath in your deposition in the case
of Jones vs. Clinton when you responded (once or twice) to the
question, `Has Monica Lewinsky ever given you any gifts?'''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Clinton is also asked whether he had
knowledge that two private investigators, Terry Lenzner and Jack
Palladino, and his former chief of staff when he was Arkansas
governor, Betsy Wright, were contacted or hired to ``gather
information about witnesses or potential witnesses'' in any case
involving him.
</P>
<P>
   Lenzner worked for Clinton's legal defense team in the Jones
case, and Palladino was hired by Clinton's presidential campaign in
1992 to investigate allegations about his relationships with other
women.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said he and investigators for the Republican majority on
the Judiciary Committee believe the statements that Clinton is
asked to admit or deny are ``factual.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is free to dispute, of course, whatever he
wants,'' Hyde said. ``But by agreeing to those facts that he does
not dispute, he will allow us to narrow the issues and bring this
matter to a close more quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The document, which Hyde described as ``a notice to admit,''
poses a possible dilemma for Clinton, since he has consistently
said he has committed no crime or impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   If he refuses to answer the questions, the Judiciary Committee
could decide to try to prove certain allegations with a potentially
time-consuming investigation and Clinton could be seen as
stonewalling.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, who has vowed to try to complete the inquiry by Dec. 31,
appeared to begin laying the groundwork for blaming the White House
if the proceedings lapse into next year. Describing the letter to
Clinton as ``the most genteel way'' to obtain information from the
president, he said the future pace of the proceedings would hinge
largely on how quickly and thoroughly Clinton responds.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde noted that in 1974, the Judiciary Committee approved an
article of impeachment against President Nixon for usurping the
authority of Congress when he failed to cooperate with the panel's
Watergate investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the president's cooperation, we will meet our goal of
finishing by the end of the year,'' Hyde said. ``This, of course,
is up to the president and his advisers.''

   MADRID, Spain _ A Cuban exile group from Miami filed a suit here
Thursday against President Fidel Castro of Cuba, charging him with
genocide and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The group submitted the complaint to the Spanish court that has
brought similar charges against Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former
Chilean dictator who has been arrested in London.

CLINTON READY TO `HEED...THE AMERICAN PEOPLE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, holding out the hope of
bipartisan cooperation, said he wanted ``to heed the admoniton of
the American people'' and work with the Republican majority in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to go back to doing the people's business,'' Clinton
said, after an Oval Office meeting with Vice President Al Gore,
Senate Minority Leader Thomas Daschle and House Minority Leader
Richard Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people sent us a message that would break the
eardrums of anyone who was listening,'' Clinton said. ``They want
their business tended to. They are tired of seeing Washington
focused on politics and personalities. They want the people and
their issues and their future taken care of, and that's what we're
here to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Tuesday's elections turned out much better than expected
for congressional Democrats, voters still kept the GOP in the
majority, forcing Clinton to work with Republicans if he's to get
anything done.
</P>
<P>
   And with talk of impeachment still in the air, Clinton in the
past two days has toned down his partisan rhetoric and tried to
shift the focus to policy issues, hoping that Republicans will
sense a political advantage by turning away from the Clinton
scandals.
</P>
<P>
   For his first legislative priority when the new Congress
convenes in January, Clinton Thursday pointed to passage of a
patients' bill of rights, which would strengthen protections for
patients and increase regulation of managed-care organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In the last session, the measure lost by only five votes in the
House and came close to passage in the Senate, Clinton said. Its
chief co-sponsor in the House was Representative Greg Ganske, a
Republican physician from Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was seen by many lawmakers on both sides of the aisle
as a sure bet for passage before the Monica S. Lewinsky scandal
broke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this may be an intersting test of whether Clinton is
or is not willing to work with the Republican leadership in
Congress,'' Clifford D. May, director of communications for the
Republican National Committee, said of Clinton's statements on the
patients' bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he tries to do it strictly on his terms, I think we will
end up with gridlock. If he's willing to work with the Republicans,
who still hold the majority, there is a chance to get some
legislation done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we're going to learn,'' May said. ``Does Clinton
want to achieve something the next two years, assuming he stays in
office another two years, or does he want to continue the permanent
campaign he's waged in the last six years?''
</P>
<P>
   Though the election that denied Republican gains in the Senate
and unexpectedly gave Democrats five new House seats has emboldened
Clinton, it also kicked up dust among Republicans who had expected
big gains.
</P>
<P>
   With the GOP leadership apparently in jeopardy because of the
Republicans' showing, that matter will have to be settled before
Clinton can expect to move forward with legislation, said Stephen
Hess, a presidential scholar at the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sand is just running out the hourglass for him,'' Hess
said. ``He destroyed his sixth year. He may have a little time in
the seventh year. Certainly by the eighth year, he's a lame duck.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If he is to get anything out of this Congress, he will have
work quickly, and he will have to get through the impeachment
question quickly, and that's a question of mutual self-interest''
for Clinton and the Republican majority, who will want issues to
take to voters in 2000, Hess said.
</P>
<P>
   Though most voters Tuesday appeared to have ignored Clinton's
scandals, they have not disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   That was driven home Thursday when House Judiciary Committee
Chairman Henry J. Hyde, a Republican from Illinois, announced that
Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr would be the only major
witness in impeachment hearings against Clinton. Hyde also asked
Clinton to answer under oath 81 questions related to the Starr
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has the president cleared away his long-running dispute with
Paula Jones. Thursday, Jones's attorneys said the president's
private attorney, Robert S. Bennett, had turned down their $950,000
counteroffer to settle her sexual-harrassment suit against Clinton.
Her earlier demand was for $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't appear open to settlement overtures at this time,''
said Nisha Mohammed, a spokeswoman for the Rutherford Institute,
which arranged the lawyers for Jones.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joseph Lockhart declined to
speculate on whether the president's stronger position since the
election makes him less interested in settling the Jones suit.
Lockhart said he had ``no way of judging that.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his legislative plans, Clinton Thursday said he wanted to
``reach out to like-minded people in the other party to try to heed
the admonition of the American people and the direction that we
certainly agree we ought to take and get to work together.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his political future, he said, ``That's out of my hands.
That's up to the American people and the Congress. All I know is
I've got a day here, and I want to make the most of it.''

DEMOCRATS IN SOUTH BENEFIT FROM LARGE BLACK TURNOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (subs to correct to `Beasley' sted `easley' in 13th graf.)  (sw) 
 By KEVIN SACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When it came to getting the black vote out for
Tuesday's election, Roy Barnes did not leave much to chance.
</P>
<P>
   In the final days of the race, Georgia's Democratic candidate
for governor used every opportunity, in both his speeches and his
advertising, to accuse his Republican opponent of trying to divide
the state by race. The state Democratic Party targeted three
telephone calls and two mailings at each of 300,000 black
households, many of them in majority black Atlanta, with one flier
reminding voters that the Republican candidate for lieutenant
governor had threatened to ``kick Atlanta's ass.'' And last Sunday
morning, Barnes did not simply attend services at one black church.
He went to four, escorted by Atlanta's first black mayor and a
black Cabinet secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Those efforts were rewarded on Tuesday. Black voters went to
Georgia's polls in force, and 9 out of 10 cast ballots for Barnes,
according to surveys of voters leaving the polls. He almost
certainly would not have won without their extraordinary support.
As it was, he cruised to a nine-point victory over his Republican
opponent, Guy Millner, despite falling short of the 40 percent of
the white vote usually considered necessary for a Democrat to win
in this increasingly two-party state.
</P>
<P>
   Across much of the South, where Democrats on Tuesday won some of
their most significant victories in years, including the
governorships of South Carolina and Alabama, the same pattern
emerged. Although blacks comprised about the same share of the
national electorate as they did four years ago, according to
surveys of voters leaving the polls, their numbers increased
significantly in crucial Southern states.
</P>
<P>
   The fallout from that political debt will be substantial,
analysts said. ``In terms of governing, Tuesday's black turnout is
going to mean a heightened sensitivity to the concerns of blacks
within the party, perhaps in the way of particular policies,
appointments and benefits,'' said Merle Black, an Emory University
political scientist and an authority on Southern politics. ``And
that will be something that will persist for the indefinite
future.''
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, it took less than 24 hours for the state's
legislative black caucus to send its payback demands in a telegram
to Governor-elect Don Siegelman, a Democrat who defeated Gov. Fob
James Jr. The demands included the appointment of two blacks to
Siegelman's transition team and the selection of blacks for at
least one third of his cabinet positions. A spokeswoman for
Siegelman said he would make his appointments based on merit.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, Rep. James Clyburn, a black Democrat who
worked diligently to turn out the vote for Governor-elect Jim
Hodges, said he found the use of the word ``demands'' to be
distasteful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not be too pointed in our language,'' Clyburn said. ``We
can do this without using those inflammatory terms.'' But he added
that Hodges clearly must pay attention to his black constituents.
``He's a smart guy,'' Clyburn said. ``He knows where his margin of
victory was, and I don't think there's going to be any problem
getting our concerns addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Democrats' strength on Tuesday may also expose their
most enduring vulnerability as they challenge the Republicans for
majority status in the South. If the Democrats ever hope to lure
white moderates and suburban residents back into the fold, they
must shed the perception that the party is beholden to special
interests, including minorities, political scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Democrats can rejoice that they finally managed
to stall the seemingly inexorable advance of Republican troops
through the South. In the 11 states of the old Confederacy, they
claimed a net gain of one governorship, moving from three to four,
compared to eight in 1980. They picked up one Senate seat, and now
have eight in the region, compared to 16 in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   There was no numerical change in the South's congressional
representation, with Democrats continuing to hold 54 of the 125
seats, down from 77 of 108 seats in 1980. The Democrats won back
the North Carolina House of Representatives, which had been
considered a prime target for a Republican takeover. Now they will
hold 58 percent of all Southern legislative seats.
</P>
<P>
   But the importance of the black turnout to this year's
Democratic victories underscores the thesis that the party's
successes do not necessarily suggest any broad partisan realignment
in the South. Rather, many political analysts argue that the
Democrats benefited from unique circumstances that will be
difficult to replicate.
</P>
<P>
   This year's elections were influenced by a broad array of
unusual factors. The Democrats fielded moderate candidates who were
uncommonly well-financed. In South Carolina, for example, video
poker interests poured millions of dollars into defeating Gov.
David Beasley, a Republican who had crusaded to ban the industry.
Much of that money was spent on turning out the black vote,
Democratic officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In both South Carolina and Alabama, where Democrats won
governorships for the first time in 16 years, voters responded to
highly disciplined campaigns that focused on proposals for state
lotteries that would finance educational improvements. In the
governors' races in Georgia and Alabama, the Republicans fielded
flawed candidates _ a two-time loser in Georgia who went on to fail
a third time, and an incumbent in Alabama who had alienated many in
his own party by focusing relentlessly on social issues.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The heightened black vote was stimulated at least in part by
anger over the Republicans' pursuit of impeachment proceedings
against President Clinton, who remains popular among blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic strategists happily exploited that anger. One mailing
sent to black voters last week by the Georgia Democratic Party
featured photographs of Speaker Newt Gingrich and Kenneth Starr,
the Whitewater independent counsel. ``They couldn't win at the
ballot box, so now they want to overturn our choice,'' the
advertisement read. ``Send them a message.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did his part by speaking at a black church in Baltimore
last Sunday and by granting an interview that was broadcast on
Monday night on the BET cable network.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, black voters may also have been motivated by the
presence of three black candidates on the statewide ticket, two of
whom won. And they seem to have been incited by the perception that
Millner and his running mate, Mitch Skandalakis, had engaged in
race-baiting.
</P>
<P>
   Both men railed against the management of the city of Atlanta,
which has a black mayor that Skandalakis described in a television
advertisement as ``an incompetent boob.'' Millner closed his
campaign with an advertisement charging that Barnes favored racial
quotas in college admissions and state contracts, an accusation
that Barnes denied.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kahn, Barnes' campaign consultant, said the black vote
was ``essential, indispensable'' to his candidate's victory. In a
state where 27 percent of all registered voters are black and where
blacks almost always vote less reliably than whites, 29 percent of
Tuesday's voters were black, according to polls of voters leaving
the polling place conducted by Voter News Service. That compared to
16 percent in 1994 and 25 percent in the 1996 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
   Exit poll data was less clear in other states, with changes
within the statistical margin of error, but was consistent with
reports of heavier black voting. Compared to 1994, the black share
of the total vote was up two percentage points in South Carolina,
where Sen. Ernest Hollings, a Democrat, held on to his seat and
where Hodges, the former minority leader of the state House of
Representatives, ousted Gov. David Beasley. It was up two
percentage points over 1996 in North Carolina, where John Edwards,
a Democratic trial lawyer, defeated Sen. Lauch Faircloth, a
conservative Republican.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, where Siegelman unseated the incumbent Republican
governor, Fob James Jr., the black share of the vote declined by
one percentage point. But Siegelman won 95 percent of the black
votes cast, a bit more than the percentage won by other Southern
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most meaningful tribute to the Democrats'
organizational skills came from an unlikely source. ``All of us
want to pay the greatest respect to the ability of the Democrats in
this election to turn out their base,'' House Speaker Newt Gingrich
said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, who represents a congressional district outside of
Atlanta, said the Democrats ``have found a pretty effective formula
for competing with us head to head'' in the South. ``I think that
drive toward being a majority is now a little more in doubt,
frankly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, an estimated 260,000 blacks turned out on
Tuesday, about 50,000 more than in 1994, and Hodges defeated
Beasley by about 82,000 votes. In Georgia, an estimated 520,000
blacks voted, more than twice the 1994 number, and Barnes won by
about 150,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
   An analysis of selected precincts in the Atlanta area suggests
that this year's higher black turnout may have been a windfall from
increased voter registration under the motor voter law, which
enables people to register to vote in a variety of government
agencies, including motor vehicle offices.
</P>
<P>
   There were a number of precincts here in which the percentage of
black registered voters who showed up at the polls was actually
less than in previous elections. But the raw number of black voters
in those precincts was still higher because there is now a larger
group of blacks who are registered. Since 1994, the black share of
the electorate increased by three percentage points in Georgia and
nearly two points in South Carolina and North Carolina, and
remained about the same in Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans won the governorships in the two largest Southern
states, with George W. Bush being re-elected in Texas and his
brother Jeb winning in Florida. But in the states where Democrats
won, they won handily, with Siegelman defeating James by 16
percentage points, Barnes winning by 9 and Hodges by 8 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many Republicans said those victories were poor tests of
the South's partisan loyalties. Beasley argued that his loss in
South Carolina, like those of other Southern Republicans, was ``an
aberration'' generated by unique circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had nothing to do with the Republican Party,'' he said.
``South Carolina is a Republican state, and will continue to be a
Republican state.''

TREASURY APPEARS TO BENEFIT FROM EARLY DATA RELEASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also ECON-REPORT, FED-GREENSPAN)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A premature release by the Labor Department of
sensitive job figures brought down interest rates Thursday just as
the government was about to borrow $10 billion, upsetting much of
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department's error meant that the Treasury appeared to
save more than $200 million in interest costs over the 30-year life
of the bonds. It also bloodied bond traders, many of whom had
established their usual short positions ahead of the government's
auction and had hoped to distribute the new supply of bonds before
grappling with the job report scheduled for release Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody got whiplashed from this,'' said David Jones of
Aubrey Lanston, a specialist in Treasury securities, noting that
traders were already reeling from many weeks of market volatility
caused by foreign turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury would make no estimate of the impact on its
borrowing costs, though a spokesman did observe that other factors
could have intervened between 9:20 a.m., when rates responded
almost instantaneously to the leak, and the 1 p.m. auction.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the Treasury's savings, the benefit is likely to
prove short-lived, some Wall Street analysts said. ``The bad
memories will be carried over to future auctions,'' one predicted,
resulting in more cautious bidding.
</P>
<P>
   The monthly job figures are generally considered the most
important set of economic data, with the change in employer
payrolls _ contained in the table that was inadvertently released
on the Internet Thursday morning _ usually the figure with the most
market impact.
</P>
<P>
   After the mistake-induced rally, however, the bond market
retreated and interest rates, which move inversely to prices, rose
several hundredths of a percentage point for most maturities. The
30-year bond finished at 5.34 percent, up from 5.32 on Wednesday
and 5.30 at Thursday's auction.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market, down as much as 68 points in late morning,
rebounded smartly, with the Dow Jones industrials setting the pace
with a gain of 132.33 points, or 1.51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The change of heart in both markets was attributed variously to
a fuller look at the job figures, to relatively weak demand at the
Treasury's auction and to comments made by Alan Greenspan to the
Securities Industry Association's convention in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve chairman said he saw signs that yield
spreads and liquidity premiums among bonds of different quality
were narrowing again and that it was ``plausible'' that they would
``soon fall into more normal ranges.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond people seemed to interpret this as meaning that Greenspan
would find it less urgent to cut short-term interest rates again
when his policy body meets on Nov. 17. Stock people may have found
in his remarks reassurance that the economy was likely to keep
growing and avoid a credit crunch and business downturn that would
erode profits.
</P>
<P>
   Economists, too, came to differing conclusions after digesting
Thursday's figures, which included a rise in first-time claims for
unemployment insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of banks and brokerage houses were among the biggest
gainers. Charles Schwab jumped 4 5/8, to 58 3/8, while Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, Chase Manhattan, BankAmerica, J.P. Morgan and
BankBoston all posted gains of more than two points, perhaps buoyed
by more European rate cuts and, in Morgan's case, by takeover
speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Steel stocks had another strong day as the industry pressed its
case in Washington against what it contends is dumping by
importers. Nucor climbed 1 1/2, to 48 3/8, and USX-US Steel climbed
15/16, to 27 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines, up 2 3/4, to 108 3/4, led a higher airline
group.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index performed nearly as well
as the Dow industrials, rising 15.18, or 1.36 percent, while the
Nasdaq market and the Russell 2000 advanced fractionally.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's comments came just as investors prepared to bid on
$10 billion of bonds, in the third and last installment of the
government's $38 billion debt sale. The new bonds sold at 5.30
percent, 1 basis point higher than dealers expected and a sign of
dampened demand.

JOB FIGURES HINT AT ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER G. GOSSELIN   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The US stock market climbed again Thursday after
Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan said the risks of a
damaging credit crunch were receding and new employment statistics
suggested the economy is slowing, but not heading into recession.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed above 8900 for the first
time since last July.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow rose 132.33 points, or 1.5 percent, to close at 8915.47,
recovering from a 68-point decline earlier in the day. Other major
market measures also rose. The increases were the latest in a
five-week rally sparked by Fed interest rate cuts in late September
and mid-October that have added 835 points, or 10.3 percent, to the
Dow.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Fed chairman's remarks and the new employment figures
suggest that the economy is recovering an unusual, ``not-too-hot,
not-too-cold'' balance that it exhibited for almost three years,
but seemed to lose last summer when an unexpectedly rapid spread of
the Asian crisis to Russia and Latin America shook investor
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Goldilocks economy continues,'' said Roger Brinner, chief
economist with The Parthenon Group, a Boston management strategy
firm. ``Employment is still growing, but not so much that it adds
to the risk of inflation,'' he said. In addition, he said,
``investors' fears are becoming more reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   The government released figures showing that US employers added
fewer-than-expected jobs last month, keeping the unemployment rate
at 4.6 percent. The October job increase of 116,000 was the
smallest job gain in seven months and was sharply lower than
predictions of 180,000 new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Investors and analysts were caught off-guard by the employment
report, not so much because of what it contained but because it was
not due for release until today. Someone at the Bureau of Labor
Statistics apparently issued some charts connected with report by
mistake on the Internet, forcing the agency to move up the full
release. Labor Department officials said they would investigate why
the information was released early.
</P>
<P>
   As with all government statistics, the employment report is
released at the same pre-announced time so that no investors have
an unfair advantage in using the information to make trades.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, investors interpreted the new job figures as
signaling a weaker-than-expected economy, and drove stock prices
down. But buoyed by analysts' comments that the numbers likely
cleared the way for further Fed rate cuts and by Greenspan's
remarks about the fading danger of a credit crunch, the market
reversed direction and shot upward.
</P>
<P>
   In an afternoon speech to the Securities Industries Assocation
in Florida, the Fed chairman said that investor fears about holding
anything else besides the very safest Treasury bonds seemed to be
slacking, and with them the risk of a financial freeze-up.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank cited ``growing caution by lenders and
unsettled conditions in financial markets'' in making a surprise
quarter point cut on October 15 in the so-called federal funds
rate, the rate at which banks lend to each other. But Thursday,
Greenspan said ``we are already seeing significant signs of some
reversals'' in those problems.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan offered no hint in his speech whether he thought the
improvements have been sufficient that the Fed does not need to cut
interest rates further. But other Fed officials have suggested
recently they have not been.
</P>
<P>
   The problem that captured the attention of Greenspan and the
central bank emerged in mid-August when Russian officials announced
that the country was devaluing the ruble and defaulting on part of
its foreign debt. Although the Russian economy is not significant
on a global scale, the actions provoked a sudden clutching by
investors worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   In a matter of days, the premium that investors demanded to hold
even high quality corporate bonds instead of safe Treasury bonds
almost doubled, and the spread between riskier junk bonds and
Treasurys jumped several fold. Fed officials worried that if the
trend continued companies would find it impossible to raise the
money they need to operate and the economy would falter.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, ``Greenspan issued the all-clear sign'' said Richard
B. Berner, chief economist of Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh.
``Basically, he told us the liquidity crunch is abating,'' Berner
said.
</P>
<P>
   The news caused investors to yank money parked in the safe haven
of Treasury bonds and invest it elsewhere, a move that caused
Treasury bond prices to fall and their yield, which moves in the
opposite direction, to rise. The 30-year Treasury bond fell 7/32,
or $2.19 per $1,000 bond. Its yield, which as recently as a few
months ago was hovering in the middle four percent range, rose to
5.34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among the stocks into which investors pumped money Thursday was
Merck &AMP; Co., the world's biggest pharmaceutical manufacturer, whose
stock gained 3 11/16 to close at a record 142 a share after the
firm offered a money-back guarantee to patients using its
top-selling cholesterol drug, Zocor.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Dow, other major market measures that rose during
the day were the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index, which climbed 15.01,
or 1.3 percent, to 1133.68, and the Nasdaq Composite Index, which
gained 13.53, or 0.7 percent, to close at 1837.10.

REP. DUNN'S STAR RISES AS REPUBLICANS SQUABBLE OVER LEADERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A group of House Republicans, angry over the GOP's
disappointing performance in Tuesday's elections, is urging Rep.
Jennifer Dunn to make a bid for a top House leadership post.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn, R-Wash, said Thursday that she does not expect to attempt
to rise in leadership, where she now holds a junior position, but
added, ``I don't rule anything out.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans plan to choose leaders for the next Congress
Nov. 18, and some Republican sources said Dunn's status is rising
as a result of dissatisfaction with the current leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not clear that there will be any changes, but what's
interesting in the discussion having to do with leadership and the
future is that almost everybody includes her _ she seems to be on
everybody's slate,'' said Jack Abramoff, a leading Republican fund
raiser and a lobbyist with the Seattle-based law firm of Preston,
Gates, Ellis &AMP; Rouvelas Meeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's positioned very well because she's very articulate, able
to articulate the Republican message in a very user-friendly
format, viewed very positively by the moderate part of the party
and yet she is not viewed with huge hostility by the
conservatives,'' Abramoff said.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitol Thursday was engulfed in post-election machinations
as rebels plotted to overthrow the leaders they blame for losses in
the House. Speaker Newt Gingrich, at home in Georgia, called
allies, including Dunn, in an effort to shore up support. House
Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Livingston, R-La., considered
a bid to unseat Gingrich, and former Seattle Seahawk Steve Largent,
R-Okla., mulled a race against House Majority Leader Dick Armey,
R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. George Radanovich, R-Calif., announced Thursday that he
plans to seek the office of House Republican Conference Chairman,
now held by John Boehner.
</P>
<P>
   Among those promoting Dunn is Rep. Joe Scarborough, R-Fla., who
said ``the Republican governors are doing a great job, but in
Washington, D.C., we seem to think that the only people eligible to
lead our party are white southern Republicans. We need to reach out
to people in the House like Jennifer Dunn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some significant folks have called and urged her to consider
moving up,'' said Phillip Bond, a longtime Dunn adviser and vice
president for government relations at the Information Technology
Industry Council. ``The point they all make is that now, more than
ever, the party needs her in a more visible role.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn said she has received calls from members encouraging her to
challenge Boehner, but that she does not plan to do so. She also
has been mentioned as a possible candidate for majority leader or
chairwoman of the National Republican Congressional Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of talk right now, as there always is,'' said
Dunn, who said she had a ``productive conversation'' with Gingrich
in which he pledged to respond to concerns of disgruntled members.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a confusing time,'' she said. ``People need to take
out their frustration and their anger, and there should be some
changes made.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those calling for changes is Rep. George Nethercutt,
R-Wash., a Livingston ally who said he spoke with him Thursday
about his possible challenge to Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be open to changes in leadership, because I think for
the benefit of all of us we need to have a good strong two years
and not be as easily defined as our critics have defined us,'' he
said. ``Jennifer is an essential part of any team that emerges in
the 106th Congress, because she's done a great job thus far and has
a lot to offer the conference.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn's job as vice chairwoman of the House Republican Conference
has few defined responsibilities, but has given the three-term
congresswoman from Bellevue a seat at the leadership table and an
opportunity to work on a project of particular interest to her,
ending the gender gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm planning to run for vice chairman again, but this is a
very strange time when things can change very quickly,'' Dunn said.
``I don't have any intent to challenge Armey or Boehner, not that
those wouldn't be jobs I'd enjoy doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn has several attributes that make her attractive to
Republicans looking for a change in leadership. She is female in a
party that has trouble reaching out to women voters, and she is
telegenic in a party whose leaders do not always communicate well
on television. She has for years been talking about the importance
of communicating a message of compassionate conservatism _ a
message now in vogue among Republicans concerned that the party is
perceived as harsh.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn has one hurdle to overcome as she rises in party leadership
_ she has a libertarian position on abortion and has at times
managed to anger both supporters and opponents of abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jennifer can present a conservative agenda in a manner that
appeals to a majority of Americans,'' said Rob Nichols, an aide to
Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., and a Dunn adviser. ``She's got style,
she's a good spokesperson, and she can deliver the message, so of
course there are folks who want to increase her visibility within
the national Republican Party.''

CELL DISCOVERY CATAPULTS SMALL COMPANY INTO THE NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif.)  (With SCI-STEM-CELLS) 
(htv) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a small biotechnology company, Geron Corp. sure knows how to
make headlines. For the second time this year, it has electrified
the scientific world.
</P>
<P>
   Geron financed the university researchers who announced Thursday
that they had succeeded in growing in the laboratory human stem
cells, the embryonic progenitors of all other types of cells. In
January, the company announced that it had found a way to keep
human cells alive well past the time they normally die.
</P>
<P>
   The two discoveries have vast implications for medicine and for
Geron's business, which is aimed at treating cancer and diseases
associated with aging. The stem cells, for instance, conceivably
could be grown into nerve cells, heart cells and other types of
cells for use in transplants. For instance, new heart muscle cells
could replace tissue destroyed by a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``The integration of these two technologies positions us
ultimately to be able to repair degenerating tissues of our mortal
bodies with immortalized cells,'' Dr. Thomas Okarma, vice president
for research and development told securities analysts Thursday.
``It's an outstanding opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   However, big profits from the discoveries are probably years
away. The company, which is based in Menlo Park, Calif., has no
drugs in clinical trials yet, or even one that it is getting ready
for such trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about as early stage as they can get,'' said Richard van
den Broek, biotechnology analyst at Hambrecht &AMP; Quist.
</P>
<P>
   He said Geron also could face competition from other companies
pursuing stem cells, such as Novartis, a large Swiss pharmaceutical
company.
</P>
<P>
   Geron's stock, traded on Nasdaq, soared 2], or 31 percent, to 9
15/16 in trading that was 40 times heavier than average. The
company did not announce its findings until after trading closed,
but it had told securities analysts earlier in the day that some
announcement was coming.
</P>
<P>
   Such a spike in stock price is typical for young biotechnology
companies making big announcements but it can be short-lived. In
January, after Geron's last big announcement, the stock rose to
about $17 from about $10 but then dropped back.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Eastman, president and chief executive of Geron, said in
an interview that although developing tissues for transplants could
take years, the company could very quickly begin selling stem cells
to other pharmaceutical companies for use in research. The cells
could be used in finding genes or grown into different types of
human tissues on which to test drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a business opportunity almost immediately here,''
Eastman said. He also said that Geron is hoping to collaborate with
one or more big companies that would help finance and accelerate
the development of the stem cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one company would have the ability to fully exploit this
discovery,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Geron was started in 1990 by Michael West, who has a doctorate
in cell biology. He dropped out of medical school to develop
products based on a theory of aging that he had been researching.
The company's name, pronounced ``JEH-ron,'' comes from gerontology,
the study of old age.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Geron has been aggressive in financing academic
scientists in exchange for the exclusive commercial rights to their
work. It financed three groups working on stem cells, two of which
_ the University of Wisconsin and Johns Hopkins _ announced results
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The theory that intrigued West was that of telomeres, which cap
the ends of chromosomes like the tips of shoelaces. Each time a
cell divides, the theory goes, telomeres get shorter until they
eventually run out and the cell dies.
</P>
<P>
   In January, in what seemed to confirm the theory, the company
showed than an enzyme known as telomerase can keep the telomeres
from shrinking, thereby allowing cells to live, perhaps
indefinitely. West, who had been a vice president, quit the next
month to start a company to apply telomere theory to animals, an
effort that Geron executives had declined to pursue.
</P>
<P>
   It might seem a big leap from cell death to stem cells, which
are found in embryos at the start of life. But the company was
drawn to the study of stem cells because telomerase is active in
embryos, in which cells rapidly divide. But once the basic stem
cells differentiate into nerve cells, heart cells and so on, the
telomerase disappears and the clock leading to cell death starts
ticking. Telomerase, however, is found in cancer cells, allowing
them to divide and multiply indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Geron is working with Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, a big drug company, to
try to find a drug that will block telomerase and could be used to
treat cancer. Geron also hopes that telomerase itself can be used
as a drug or turned on inside cells to fight the diseases and
deterioration of the skin, eyes, brain and other organs associated
with aging.
</P>
<P>
   Besides formidable scientific challenges, the company faces
ethical issues about working with stem cells. There is a ban on
federal financing of work using tissues derived from human embryos.
The company has formed an ethics committee of outsiders to advise
it on such matters.

WORKER SHORTAGE   THREATENS ECONOMY, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ An acute shortage of skilled workers in Massachusetts
will continue to plague high-technology and related companies and
could further limit growth of an economy that is already slowing,
according to a new report.
</P>
<P>
   A booming economy and unemployment at historically low levels
have created such a tight labor market that some Boston-area
companies compete ruthlessly for skilled workers, luring them from
competitors across town or in other states with sky-high salaries,
signing bonuses, and stock options.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom has it that a slowdown eases a tight labor
market as unemployment rises and more people look for work. But
report to be released Monday found that a decline in the pace of
job growth, which is being forecast by local economists, will not
be enough to ease a shortage of skilled workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's counterintuitive,'' said William Guenther, president of
Mass Insight, the Cambridge economic consulting firm that prepared
the study.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``The fact is the kind of people you need in these highly
skilled and technical areas are in short-supply all around the
world, and they will continue to be in short supply'' in a
slowdown, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mass Insight's report highlights the gap between education and
the needs of any modern, high-technology-based economy. But as the
economy heads into its first slowdown after &UR;  &LR; more than seven years
of expansion, the labor market problem will, if not addressed,
persist and could hinder growth, economists said.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts' job growth is expected to slow in 1999, by half,
to less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The state's jobless rate, at 3.3 percent in September, was far
below the US jobless rate. The Labor Department Thursday &UR;  &LR; pegged US
unemployment at 4.6 percent in October, unchanged from September.
</P>
<P>
   Business in the Boston area, with its high housing costs,
tightness of commercial office space, and cold climate, has had
difficulty competing for workers against other high-tech cities
such as San Francisco or Austin, which is known as the ``Third
Coast'' due to its fast-growing technology industry.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the problem, the report said, is the business mix in
Massachusetts. Local firms in software, telecommunications,
financial services and other sophisticated industries are heavily
reliant on highly trained workers.
</P>
<P>
   Companies have gone to great lengths to train workers, even
creating educational programs on the job site, Mass Insight said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such efforts, ``executives interviewed indicated that
their expansion is now being constrained by the difficulties'' of
hiring, Yolanda Kodrzycki, an economist for the Federal Reserve
Bank of Boston and Mass Insight adviser, said in the report.
</P>
<P>
   The report was based on interviews with 10 key Boston employers
from Fidelity Investments to Zoom Telephonics, and interviews with
five Boston-area universities.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity, for example, had more than 600 open positions,
reflecting the demands of updating its information and computer
systems. But the world's largest mutual fund firm sometimes can't
fill positions for skilled technology professionals because they
prefer going to companies at the cutting edge of the technology
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Millenium, a Cambridge healthcare technology firm, reported that
it had to go outside the state, to California, for one quarter of
its work force.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's big advantages over California and Texas, the study
found: Its universities.
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage is the large number of immigrants into
Massachusetts who are well-educated in comparison with immigrants
going to southwestern states. The labor shortage is blamed partly
on a population increase that, at one-half percent a year, is below
the national average.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, there was a net loss of 5,000 Massachusetts workers to
other states. This was more than offset, however, by a migration to
the state from other countries, for a net increase in population
due to migration of 8,200 individuals, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   That's quite an improvement over recent years, Guenther said,
but added, ``It's too slow to keep up with the job increases.''

   WASHINGTON _ An intense struggle for control of the House is
underway, with Rep. Bob Livingston conducting a telephone campaign
to replace Rep. Newt Gingrich as speaker and Gingrich fighting with
a counter-campaign that has given some members pause about ousting
him.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a small band of Republicans vowed on Thursday
that they would not vote to re-elect Gingrich under any
circumstances, a move that, because of the Republicans' shrunken
House majority, could tie the party in knots for months because it
could throw the speakership to a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., said: ``I personally have made the
decision that I cannot vote for Newt Gingrich for speaker in
January, and there are six others who have told me they feel the
same way, seven people who just will not, and it takes six to
deadlock the vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Fury at the speaker has boiled over since Tuesday's elections,
when Republicans suffered a net loss of five seats in the House.
They blamed Gingrich, the party's chief strategist. But many were
already angry at him for what they said was his failure to
articulate a clear message for the party going into the elections
and for a messy budget process that gave President Clinton a
political edge and contradicted Republican principles of fiscal
conservativism by containing massive amounts of pork spending.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans are to meet Nov. 18 to vote by secret ballot
for their leaders. Whoever wins the party's nomination for speaker
then stands for election by the full House in January. Even if
Gingrich wins the secret ballot, he could be denied re-election as
speaker in January if Salmon and at least five others refuse to
vote for him. Because the Republicans now control the House by only
12 seats, it would take just six votes against Gingrich to deny him
a majority and allow Democrats to potentially elect one of their
own as speaker.
</P>
<P>
   With such a chaotic and unacceptable prospect looming,
Livingston told Gingrich that he should step aside for the good of
the party, according to Republican officials. The officials said
that Livingston spoke to Gingrich shortly after the disastrous
election returns but also before the election, reflecting
Livingston's earlier displeasure with the speaker over the budget
process.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans said that both Livingston, the chairman of
the Appropriations Committee and one of the few members with the
stature to stand for speaker, and Gingrich were working the phones
on Thursday in a struggle for votes. Livingston has said nothing
publicly about a challenge to Gingrich, but several members and
aides said on Thursday that he would announce his intentions,
possibly as soon as Friday, after he had determined if he could
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't do it 'til he has his ducks in a row, and right now a
lot of people are still loyal to the speaker,'' said an aide to a
Republican who, like many others, is trying to straddle the line
between fealty to a speaker who may retain power and encouragement
to a challenger who offers a salve to an embattled party.

FRANCE OFFERS TO LEAD FORCE SENT TO KOSOVO WITH MONITORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Originally skedded as FRANCE-NATO.) 
(js) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   PARIS _ Dismissing doubts about France's support for NATO in
Kosovo after a French officer was charged with passing bombing
plans to Serbia, the French government offered Thursday to lead the
allied force that will protect international observers in the
Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
   France backed NATO's threat to carry out air strikes against
Serbia last month if it had refused to pull back forces that were
attacking ethnic Albanian civilians in Kosovo, Defense Minister
Alain Richard said Thursday. He said France would provide between
one-third and one-half of the 1,200 to 1,800 troops in the
``extraction force'' that would be ready to rush to the aid of the
unarmed observers who are to monitor the Serbian pullback in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO diplomats said that demonstrative support for the new
mission by Richard and Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine at a joint
appearance in Paris Thursday showed French determination to limit
the damage from the espionage scandal and underline France's
commitment to a more effective European security policy in the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials in Brussels said that the French openness in
revealing the spy case this week and their willingness to deal with
its consequences had been reassuring to other allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hard blow,'' Richard said of Monday's disclosure that
French authorities had arrested Maj. Pierre-Henri Bunel, an army
officer assigned to the alliance's top-level military committee in
Brussels, on suspicion of passing secrets to a Serbian agent in
Brussels. ``But we made the decision not to try to settle the
matter in private,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear from what Richard and Vedrine said Thursday that
they hoped that the frankness would nip in the bud any suspicions
that Bunel's action stemmed from secret French sympathies with
Serbia that date to their alliance in World War I.
</P>
<P>
   Doubts had been raised last winter, especially in Washington, by
disclosures that another French officer, Maj. Herve Gourmelon, had
been withdrawn from the NATO peacekeeping force in Bosnia after
being accused of tipping off the Bosnian Serb leader, Radovan
Karadzic, about plans the allies had to arrest him on war crimes
charges.
</P>
<P>
   The plans were put off and the initial disclosure in Washington
was followed by near-total silence in Paris. French officials said
then that the officer had only been following orders in pursuing
contacts with the Bosnian Serb leadership. They conceded that
perhaps he had been a little too zealous in trying to persuade
Karadzic to surrender, rather than wait for U.S. or other allied
troops to come and get him. They took no further action against
Gourmelon.
</P>
<P>
   Bunel has reportedly confessed that he passed military secrets
to Serbia because he took a liking to the Serbs during service in
Bosnia in 1996. As the French daily Le Monde noted, some allies
wondered whether the major's sympathies might be shared more widely
within the French military establishment.
</P>
<P>
   During the Bosnian war, Francois Mitterrand, then France's
president, said, ``As long as I live, France will never make war
against Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   But France nearly did make war against the Bosnian Serbs in
1995, after Mitterrand was succeeded by President Jacques Chirac,
who was outraged when Serbian forces in Bosnia took French U.N.
peacekeepers hostage to try to ward off NATO bombing that summer.
</P>
<P>
   An intense NATO bombing campaign, and new backbone by reinforced
French and British troops serving with the peacekeepers, led
Slobodan Milosevic, who was president of Serbia at the time, to
negotiate an end to the fighting in Bosnia. Now, as president of
Yugoslavia, Milosevic agreed under the threat of bombing last month
to stop Serbian attacks against civilians and separatist Albanian
forces in Kosovo and to negotiate an agreement that would give
Albanians autonomy in the province, but not independence.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   According to Le Monde, it was U.S. Army intelligence that first
became suspicious of Bunel's contacts with a Serbian intelligence
operative in Brussels, Col. Jovan Milanovic, and tipped off French
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Richard refused to confirm that account Thursday, and officials
in Brussels had no comment. But French investigators lost no time
in summoning Bunel to Paris, obtaining a confession and turning him
over to civilian prosecutors. They could charge him with supplying
intelligence to a foreign power, punishable by a 15-year prison
term.
</P>
<P>
   Richard said Thursday that what the major had turned over was
not a detailed target list, as reported in Le Monde, but
``preparatory documents'' that gave a general idea of what the
allies planned to do if Milosevic refused to back down in Kosovo.

LOS ANGELES-AREA CONTRACTOR VYING FOR REUSABLE-ROCKET CONTRACT
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attention Washington state editors.) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JIM SKEEN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The north Los Angeles County community that built
the B-2 stealth bomber and regularly welcomes the space shuttle
fleet back from its missions may soon be the site for the final
assembly of a fleet of reusable rockets that will deliver
satellites into space.
</P>
<P>
   Kistler Aerospace, a Washington state company, plans to award a
contract by January for the assembly of five rockets in 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates for the work are Northrop Grumman, which would
use Site 4 at Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale; and Lockheed Martin,
which would use a facility in Louisiana, said Sydney Shaw, a
spokeswoman for Kistler.
</P>
<P>
   Site 4 in Palmdale is now being used for the B-2 stealth bomber
program, but that work is winding down. Site 4 is also being eyed
by Antelope Valley officials as a potential final assembly site for
the joint strike fighter.
</P>
<P>
   If Kistler chooses Palmdale, the rocket work could be completed
in plenty of time for Site 4 to accommodate the joint strike
fighter program. A prime contractor for the production of the plane
is scheduled to be made in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   No job estimates were available from Kistler. Those familiar
with the project estimate that it would bring in more than 100
positions.
</P>
<P>
   Kistler is developing a two-stage rocket to lift satellites into
space. Each stage would be equipped with parachutes and air bags to
allow them to be recovered and used again in future flights. The
company plans to conduct its launches in Nevada and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Kistler is considering Palmdale is another
indication that California, in general, and the Antelope Valley, in
particular, are well-positioned to grab a piece of the commercial
space industry. There are several space companies in California,
including four in the Antelope Valley, and there is a wealth of
aerospace expertise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're moving from airplanes to space,'' said Mayor Frank
Roberts of Palmdale's neighboring city Lancaster. ``California is
the ideal place for that kind of work.''
</P>
<P>
   A study entitled ``Beyond Consolidation _ A Study of the
Continuing Transformation of Aerospace and Defense in Southern
California'' concludes the region can pick up 73,000 new aerospace
jobs over the next 20 years, mainly from commercial space activity.
</P>
<P>
   The aerospace study was conducted by Chicago-based consultants
A.T. Kearney on behalf of the Los Angeles Regional Technology
Alliance and the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The study states the commercial space industry has the potential
for 10 percent annual growth over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most visible commercial space effort is VentureStar,
a reusable spaceship being designed by Lockheed Martin's Skunk
Works plant in Palmdale. The goal of the spacecraft is to lower the
cost of putting a payload into space from $10,000 a pound to less
than $1,000 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   The $4.5 billion VentureStar is projected to begin flying in
2004.
</P>
<P>
   As a stepping stone toward VentureStar, Skunk Works is building
the X-33, a suborbital aircraft that will test technologies the
company plans to use on the spacecraft. The X-33 is expected to
make its first flights in late 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Other space companies in the Antelope Valley are the Boeing Co.,
which modifies the space shuttle fleet at Air Force Plant 42; and
two entrepreneurial start-ups _ Space Access in Palmdale and Rotary
Rocket, which is building a plant at the Mojave Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Palmdale is located 22 miles northwest of downtown Los
Angeles. &UR;  &QL;

MARKET PLACE: TALKS STILL ON FOR EUROPEAN MEGA-MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France, Germany)  (mk) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talk about an on-and-off affair. The French drug maker
Rhone-Poulenc SA and Hoechst AG of Germany are again pondering a
merger that would create one of the largest sellers of
pharmaceutical and agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of the courtship between Rhone-Poulenc and Hoechst have
circulated in Europe for weeks. Yet news reports last week that the
deal had ended apparently upset several executives involved.
According to an executive with knowledge of the negotiations, they
are progressing.
</P>
<P>
   If a deal emerges, it will rival in scope the industry's three
failed mergers earlier this year. Just as many top drug makers are
out to become life sciences companies, with holdings in
biotechnology, agriculture and pharmaceuticals, Rhone-Poulenc and
Hoechst would be a world leader.
</P>
<P>
   The merged company would have a 14 percent share of the world's
$50 billion agribusiness market, according to analysts, making it a
co-leader with Novartis AG. Rhone-Poulenc and Hoechst would also
have $13 billion in worldwide pharmaceutical sales, easily
outpacing the American giants Johnson &AMP; Johnson and Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has happened here is that Novartis has been a good
business model, with agribusiness and pharmaceuticals,'' said Mark
Becker, an analyst who follows European pharmaceuticals for J.P.
Morgan Securities in London. ``But it is very important that the
next deal that is announced be completed. After the mergers that
failed this year, nobody is going to believe any deal until it
actually gets done.''
</P>
<P>
   Both companies declined to comment Thursday. But even investors
were having an odd reaction to the merger speculation, bidding up
one and dropping the other. Shares of Hoechst closed Thursday in
Frankfurt at 73.74 marks, up 1.9 percent. During the past two
weeks, Hoechst's shares have soared 16.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders of Rhone-Poulenc have not been so fortunate. After
rising sharply last week, the company's shares closed in Paris
Thursday at 256.5 francs, down 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   American investor reaction to a possible merger has shown the
same pattern. Within the past two weeks, the American depository
receipts of Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc have risen sharply. Hoechst's
closed Thursday at $44.75, up $1.6875. Rhone-Poulenc's dipped 31.25
cents, to close at $46.75.
</P>
<P>
   Investors may have cause to be skeptical. Even though
Rhone-Poulenc and Hoechst can transform themselves from two
second-tier pharmaceutical players into a global monolith with the
merger, analysts are not applauding the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Their complaint: Rhone-Poulenc and Hoechst could find more
strategic merger partners. Both companies get roughly 25 percent of
their pharmaceutical sales in the United States, according to
Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, a brokerage firm in Britain. That is
sharply less than most of their competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The companies' failure to pursue the U.S. market has been
costly. The pharmaceutical market in the United States is growing
at 10 percent annually, compared with a growth rate of just 4
percent in Europe, according to Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. If
Rhone-Poulenc and Hoechst merge, they will be going in the wrong
geographic direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this merger occurs, it won't meet the strategic need of
either company,'' said Anthony Cox, a pharmaceuticals analyst with
Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. ``The core pharmaceuticals at both
companies are poor and they lack marketing power in the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Several roadblocks could easily sidetrack the merger
discussions. Analysts note that Rhone-Poulenc and Hoechst will be
hard pressed to dismiss any employees if a merger succeeds.
</P>
<P>
   Hoechst has already angered many of its workers in Germany
through an extensive restructuring. Not only is Jurgen Dormann, the
company's chairman, unloading many of the company's chemical
operations, he is winnowing the work force by 80,000 jobs through
next year, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, like any merger discussion, this one has its share of
drama. European stock analysts believe the deal is being pushed
from the French side. Several large European investors in
Rhone-Poulenc, analysts said, are convinced that the merger may be
a way to rid themselves of Jean-Rene Fourtou, the company's chief
executive officer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Fourtou never appears to be on top of things,'' said Jonas
Morner, a pharmaceuticals analyst with Deutche Bank Securities in
London. ``He has a reputation in analysts' meetings of getting his
facts wrong, of not knowing the company's income or debt levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts recall incidents in which colleagues nudged Fourtou
beneath the table for making misstatements. But investors might
have overlooked these problems had it not been for Rhone-Poulenc's
problems with Centeon, the company's blood plasma joint venture
with Hoechst.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration temporarily shut down
Centeon's Illinois manufacturing plant in August so the company
could make quality control improvements at the plant. The shutdown
came after repeated warnings from the FDA, and contributed to a net
loss at the joint venture that could total $150 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   A Rhone-Poulenc spokesman said Fourtou was a highly intelligent
man who was responsible for the company's successful expansion. The
spokesman said the fact that English was Fourtou's second language
may have caused some language misunderstandings at analyst
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite the steep hurdles it faces, the merger may indeed
happen. Analysts note that Hoechst has mysteriously switched an
analysts meeting on Nov. 17 to Frankfurt from New York. Hoechst
officials told one analyst in Europe that the switch was made
because three of the company's directors could not travel to New
York on that day. They could, however, come to Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The switch has ignited speculation among investors and analysts
that Hoechst will announce that it is selling off Celanese, a
Dallas petrochemical company that had sales of $4.77 billion last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening is that Hoechst is getting rid of its
chemical baggage,'' said one analyst who asked not to be
identified. ``What the company is doing really is getting rid of
its poison pills. After the chemical companies are gone, Hoechst is
going to look like a cheap life sciences company.''

ADMINISTRATION SAYS IT IS PREPARING TO STRKE IRAQ, BUT SETS NO
DEADLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also IRAQ-U.N.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the Security Council declared President Saddam
Hussein in ``flagrant violation'' of United Nations resolutions,
the Clinton administration moved ahead Thursday with preparations
for air strikes against Iraq, Administration and other Western
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Thursday night, President Clinton called Iraq's
decision to end cooperation with United Nations weapons inspectors
``totally unacceptable'' and suggested that the United States was
prepared to act soon if Saddam did not reverse the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The burden is on Iraq to get back in compliance and meet its
obligations _ immediately,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has not yet set a deadline, however, and
officials said it had no timetable for military action. But they
also made it clear that the United States did not support a new
11th-hour mission by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan or other
diplomats, suggesting that a military response could come swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows what he needs to do,'' an administration official
said of Saddam. ``He doesn't need any more messages.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen completed a tour Thursday of
the Persian Gulf allies with stops in Oman and the United Arab
Emirates, before flying to Egypt, where he met with President Hosni
Mubarak and other Egyptian officials. Cohen, traveling with Under
Secretary of State Thomas Pickering and the commander of U.S.
forces in the Gulf, Gen. Anthony Zinni, ended the day in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cohen won no public expressions of support for the
Administration's stance against Iraq, officials said he had
received pledges of cooperation from some gulf allies for any
attack the United States might lead. The officials said that while
many Arab states expressed sympathy for the Iraqi people, there had
been less opposition to the use of force than in previous
confrontations with Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   In brief remarks at the White House earlier Thursday, Clinton
said he believed that the Persian Gulf allies had pledged support
for ``whatever decisions we ultimately make.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration and the Pentagon have refused to disclose
details of exactly what support Cohen and his entourage are
seeking.
</P>
<P>
   But American and European officials said Thursday that Saudi
Arabia had, for instance, agreed to let the United States use
aircraft based at Prince Sultan Air Base outside Riyadh to support
a strike. The officials also said Kuwait and the United Arab
Emirates had agreed to allow American planes based in those
countries to be used if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has sharply reduced the size of its forces in
the area, from a high of more than 400 aircraft to about 170
aircraft now. It has also reduced its fleet in the gulf to 13
warships, led by the aircraft carrier Dwight Eisenhower, though it
has doubled the number of cruise missiles those ships are carrying.
For a time earlier this year, the United States had two carriers
and more than 30 other warships.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at the Pentagon said the forces there could
conduct a potent strike against Iraq on a moment's notice.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday Cohen's entourage is scheduled to visit Turkey, which
allows U.S. and British aircraft to patrol the so-called no-flight
zone over northern Iraq from its air base at Incirlik. Cohen then
plans to stop in Paris for meetings with French military officials
before returning to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The White House announced that the president's national security
adviser, Sandy Berger, would meet with his counterparts from
Britain and France, John Holmes and Jean David Lavitte, during a
previously scheduled trip to Paris on Saturday.

 &HT;    Hyde: Independent counsel to be star witness
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington _ When House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde announced
Thursday that the marquee witness of his impeachment inquiry would
be independent counsel Kenneth Starr, the Illinois Republican was
giving Democrats exactly what they had been asking for.
</P>
<P>
   But in addition to calling Starr as his only major witness, Hyde
is asking Clinton to admit or deny 81 statements derived from the
Starr report, which has some Democrats complaining that Hyde's move
is a political trap.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton does not admit to all the stipulations,they say,
including those that he made ``false and misleading'' statements
under oath, then the Democrats will most likely have to call their
own slate of witnesses to rebut Starr. They could then be blamed
for dragging out the proceedings they have tried to limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine a trial where the District Attorney is the only
witness,'' said New York Democrat Jerrold Nadler, a member of the
panel. ``This is like the Moscow show trials from the 1930s, I mean
why bother putting on a defense at all?''
</P>
<P>
   The 81 questions are set out in an 11-page letter from Hyde to
Clinton asking the president to ``admit or deny certain facts that
appear to be established by the record.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the questions are fairly innocuous, such as the one
asking the president to admit or deny that he is the ``chief law
enforcement officer of the United States of America.'' Others, are
more tantalizing, prying into the president's involvement in what
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky told a federal grand jury
about their relationship and whether the president tried to
influence the testimony of Betty Currie, his personal secretary who
often acted as a go-between during his 18-month relationship with
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in one question, the Republican investigators ask:
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you admit or deny that on January 18, 1998, at or about 5
p.m., you had a meeting with Betty Currie at which you made
statements similar to any of the following regarding your
relationship with Monica Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   a. 'You were always there when she was there, right? We were
never really alone.'
</P>
<P>
   b. 'You could see and hear everything.'
</P>
<P>
   c. 'Monica came on to me and I never touched her right?'
</P>
<P>
   d. 'She wanted to have sex with me and I couldn't do that.'
</P>
<P>
   The questions also ask Clinton to admit or deny his involvement
in helping Lewinsky snare a job in New York, including whether his
close friend Vernon Jordan intervened on her behalf. Starr has
suggested that Lewinsky was offered a job in exchange for her
silence.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also charged that Clinton encouraged Lewinsky to lie, and
that is addressed in the questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you admit or deny that you discussed with Monica Lewinsky
... that if either of you were questioned about the existence of
your relationship you would deny its existence?''
</P>
<P>
   The White House expressed little enthusiasm for the questions or
the notion of having Starr be the main witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Chairman Hyde is looking for Mr. Starr to be the main and
primary witness, I think fairness would dictate that there will be
some access or release to the Democrats _ and hopefully to the
White House _ of all the information that he's compiled,'' said Joe
Lockhart, press secretary to the president.
</P>
<P>
   But Hyde, speaking to reporters in Chicago, said that the
impeachment inquiry would continue with or without the answers to
the questions. He also left open the possibility that other
witnesses would be called before or after the Nov. 19th hearing
featuring Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``The election is over, and we must now turn back to the
unpleasant duty that the Constitution requires of us,'' Hyde said.
``The search for the truth must now begin without distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting the public's frustration with the inquiry, Hyde said
wanted it over as soon as possible. Hyde said the hearings, a
committee vote and a floor vote on articles of impeachment could
happen by the end of the year. If that is true, then House Speaker
Newt Gingrich would have to call members from the 105th Congress
back to town in December to take the historic step of voting out
articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   John Conyers, the ranking Democrat of the committee, said he had
had not been consulted about the questions. He spent his day
gathering input from fellow Democrats on the committee about how to
proceed. ``I am also concerned that Chairman Hyde has concluded,
before even a single hearing has been held that there will be
articles of impeachment,'' Conyers said. ``That does not square the
assertion of a fair and judicious process.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in quality, not quantity,'' said Georgia Republican
Rep. Bob Barr, praising Hyde for limiting the witness list to
Starr. ``I've maintained all along that there is not need to have a
lot of witnesses. ``
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Nadler's statement, Barr said that the impeachment
trial occurs in the Senate, not the House. ``These people (the
Democrats) do not understand the process or they are doing this on
purpose,'' Barr said. ``This is not a trial. This is akin to a
probable cause hearing. No matter what we did they would find
something to complain about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr, one of the most outspoken members of the Judiciary
Committee and the first to call for the impeachment of the
president, said he did not think that the panel needed to reinvent
Starr's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a great deal of evidence, but it is very clear, there
is no need to invent the wheel,'' Barr said. ``I think we are
moving forward and we will be ready to put forward articles or an
article of impeachment by the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   And to lawmakers who are not on the committee, there was a
palpable concern that it could erupt into partisan squabbling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Judiciary Committee still continues to puzzle me,'' said
Georgia Republican Jack Kingston. ``No matter what Henry Hyde does,
they will not agree. If he calls it square, they will say it has to
be round, if he calls it round, they will call it square. This is
why the public is sick of this. ``

 &HT;    Hyde: Independent counsel to be star witness
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington _ When House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde announced
Thursday that the marquee witness of his impeachment inquiry would
be independent counsel Kenneth Starr, the Illinois Republican was
giving Democrats exactly what they had been asking for.
</P>
<P>
   But in addition to calling Starr as his only major witness, Hyde
is asking Clinton to admit or deny 81 statements derived from the
Starr report, which has some Democrats complaining that Hyde's move
is a political trap.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton does not admit to all the stipulations,they say,
including those that he made ``false and misleading'' statements
under oath, then the Democrats will most likely have to call their
own slate of witnesses to rebut Starr. They could then be blamed
for dragging out the proceedings they have tried to limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine a trial where the District Attorney is the only
witness,'' said New York Democrat Jerrold Nadler, a member of the
panel. ``This is like the Moscow show trials from the 1930s, I mean
why bother putting on a defense at all?''
</P>
<P>
   The 81 questions are set out in an 11-page letter from Hyde to
Clinton asking the president to ``admit or deny certain facts that
appear to be established by the record.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the questions are fairly innocuous, such as the one
asking the president to admit or deny that he is the ``chief law
enforcement officer of the United States of America.'' Others, are
more tantalizing, prying into the president's involvement in what
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky told a federal grand jury
about their relationship and whether the president tried to
influence the testimony of Betty Currie, his personal secretary who
often acted as a go-between during his 18-month relationship with
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in one question, the Republican investigators ask:
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you admit or deny that on January 18, 1998, at or about 5
p.m., you had a meeting with Betty Currie at which you made
statements similar to any of the following regarding your
relationship with Monica Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   a. 'You were always there when she was there, right? We were
never really alone.'
</P>
<P>
   b. 'You could see and hear everything.'
</P>
<P>
   c. 'Monica came on to me and I never touched her right?'
</P>
<P>
   d. 'She wanted to have sex with me and I couldn't do that.'
</P>
<P>
   The questions also ask Clinton to admit or deny his involvement
in helping Lewinsky snare a job in New York, including whether his
close friend Vernon Jordan intervened on her behalf. Starr has
suggested that Lewinsky was offered a job in exchange for her
silence.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also charged that Clinton encouraged Lewinsky to lie, and
that is addressed in the questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you admit or deny that you discussed with Monica Lewinsky
... that if either of you were questioned about the existence of
your relationship you would deny its existence?''
</P>
<P>

BRAZIL'S AUSTERITY PLAN CLEARS IMPORTANT HURDLE ON PENSION COST 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Congress approved measures late
Wednesday intended to reduce imbalances between the public and
private pension systems, a major element of the austerity plan
announced by the government last week.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was closely watched by the International Monetary Fund,
which is working out the details of a $30 billion bailout for
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Reducing pension inequities is the key element in a package the
government hopes will restore the confidence of international
investors. Fears have grown that Brazil's expanding debt may
trigger a recession throughout Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Minister Pedro Malan took charge of presenting the
reforms to the public and to Congress, preaching that civil service
pensions, which are expected to run a $35 billion deficit next
year, are draining the country.
</P>
<P>
   He said the imbalance between the systems was crippling Brazil:
while $46 billion went to provide benefits for 18 million workers
in the private system, the government spent $33 billion on pensions
for fewer than 3 million retired public employees.
</P>
<P>
   The measure bases retirement in the private sector on the number
of years a worker has contributed to the plan rather than on years
worked. It also sets new minimum retirement ages in the civil
service of 53 for men and 48 for women, provided the men have paid
into the pension system for 35 years and the women for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It signals in a very clear way that the government has the
necessary majority to pass the fiscal adjustment measures,'' said
Aecio Neves, the House leader of President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso's Brazilian Social Democracy Party.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders, however, argue that the government is
unfairly penalizing civil service pensioners because of the
economic crisis. As its currency has weakened, Brazil has raised
interest rates, which has depressed growth.
</P>
<P>
   Olivio Dutra, governor-elect of Rio Grande do Sul state and a
rising star in the opposition Workers Party, said the government
should lower interest rates to help small and medium-size
businesses. Government incentives for agriculture and small
businesses, he added, would rebuild the tax base. ``The government
is doing exactly the opposite,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The government failed to scrap the generous system of giving
civil servants full salaries until they die. But the president is
expected to issue an executive order next week that would require
civil service pensioners collecting over $1,000 a month to pay up
to 20 percent of their benefits back into the system.
</P>
<P>
   Riordan Roett, director of Latin American studies at Johns
Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, said
that while the vote Wednesday was encouraging, Brazil would have to
do more to establish its credibility. Last year, he recalled,
Cardoso's government announced a harsh austerity package to raise
$18 billion, only to abandon most of it. ``People are more
skeptical this time,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Cardoso dispensed with his trademark aloofness and openly pushed
for his program, meeting with party leaders and sending telegrams
summoning coalition members to vote.
</P>
<P>
   A bloc of 37 legislators representing agricultural businesses
was promised by the government that it would delay repayment of
more than $1 billion in farmers' debt in return for their votes,
said Hugo Biehl, leader of the farmers' bloc in Congress. The
government also granted farm businesses $280 million in concessions
in exchange for their support.

GOP AWARDS 2000 CONVENTION TO PHILADELPHIA  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republican National Committee on Thursday chose
Philadelphia over New York and three other cities for the party's
national convention in 2000, a decision that disappointed New
York's mayor, Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   With an announcement that turned attention from the Republicans'
dispiriting election results, party leaders picked a city that was
also a finalist for the Democratic national convention in 2000. But
after Philadelphia officials were told they had won, they informed
the Democrats that they were withdrawing their bid, leaving Los
Angeles as the probable front-runner for that convention.
</P>
<P>
   Denver and Boston are among five other cities competing for the
Democrats, who are expected to narrow their finalist list next
week. The final selection is expected by January, but many senior
Democrats say party leaders favor Los Angeles as part of an effort
to win California's 54 electoral votes, the most of any state.
</P>
<P>
   At a City Hall news conference in New York, Giuliani attributed
the rejection of New York City, in part, to Sen. Alfonse D'Amato's
loss to Rep. Charles Schumer in New York's Senate race, combined
with a record victory by Pennsylvania's Republican senior senator,
Arlen Specter, who won with his widest margin of victory, 26
percentage points, in four general elections to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very hard to overcome the election results,''
Giuliani said. ``I was afraid that something like this would
happen, and I think it had an impact on it.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It had come down to three cities, and I think
something like this can tip the balance in terms of atmospherics
and feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he understood that Indianapolis was the other
finalist, but San Antonio and New Orleans were also under
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   It was not especially surprising that Philadelphia won a
national convention, after intense sales pitches to both major
parties by a bipartisan committee, known as Philadelphia 2000, made
up of business and political leaders from Pennsylvania, New Jersey
and Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   But it was somewhat unexpected that it was the Republicans who
grabbed it first. Philadelphia, the nation's fifth-largest city,
with a population of 1.3 million, is a heavily Democratic, highly
unionized city that frequently wins federal dollars through efforts
of Mayor Edward Rendell, a Democrat who is close to President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Rendell, who wore an elephant-adorned tie to an afternoon news
conference, is a rising star in the Democratic Party, a strong
leader who has steered his city out of financial chaos into a
vibrant metropolis with new restaurants, museums, hotels, a
convention center and, perhaps most strikingly, a sense of pride.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, Rendell has proved to be a political
pragmatist, maintaining a solid working relationship with state
leaders, most of whom are Republicans. He enjoys a particularly
strong alliance with Gov. Tom Ridge, a popular Republican whose
vice-presidential aspirations could be considerably enhanced by the
staging of a party convention in his home state. On Tuesday, Ridge
won election to a second term with 57 percent of the vote in a
four-way race.
</P>
<P>
   Together, Ridge and Rendell served as honorary chairmen of the
Philadelphia 2000 efforts and appeared together to announce their
prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a great day for us,'' Rendell said. ``If I had told
Philadelphia five years ago that we had beat out New York and
Chicago for the most important convention, nobody, but nobody would
have believed us.'' Chicago was eliminated earlier.
</P>
<P>
   As a further justification for the selection, Republicans
control both chambers of the State Legislature and have both United
States Senators, Specter and Rick Santorum. Beyond that, however,
Pennsylvania is a presidential-year plum, with 23 electoral votes
that, in the past two elections have swung for the Democrats.
Clinton carried the state twice after George Bush won in it in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia, which promotes itself as the cradle of American
democracy as home to the Liberty Bell and the site of the signing
of the Declaration of Independence, is no stranger to political
conventions. The Republicans have held their nominating convention
there five times, the last in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   But to win any convention, the city had to overcome the problem
of an insufficient supply of hotel rooms downtown. The bid
committee made a major thrust of its work pushing for construction
of 2,000 new hotel rooms by the year 2000. David Cohen, a
co-chairman of the bid committee and a former chief of staff to
Rendell, said in an interview that 13 hotels were under
construction in the metropolitan area.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Snow will accumulate on the high Plains from western Nebraska to
the western Dakotas and along the Front Range of the Rockies from
northern Colorado to Montana as a developing low pressure system
draws moist air from the southeast up the sloping terrain.
Moreover, moist air will cool on ascent, setting the stage for
snowfalls of 6 inches or more in some areas, with the heaviest snow
falling mainly on the highest east-facing slopes.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, scattered showers and spotty drizzle will dampen
the region from west Texas to western Kansas. Isolated
thunderstorms may develop later in the day across south Texas as
moist air from the Gulf of Mexico increases over the region.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, coastal rains and mountain snows will develop in the
Pacific Northwest from northern California to western Washington as
a cold, upper-level low pressure system arrives from the Gulf of
Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   With the remnants of Tropical Storm Mitch racing northeast
across the Atlantic Friday, waterlogged areas in south Florida,
which were deluged by as much as 8 inches of rain from Wednesday to
early Thursday, will rapidly dry out under ample sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly cloudy, chilly weather will persist from the Great Lakes
to the Appalachians Friday as Canadian air is moistened in transit
across tepid waters and then forced to rise over land. Splotches of
light snow or drizzle will prevail downwind of the southern and
eastern shores. Winds from the northwest will dry on descent from
the mountains, bringing partial sunshine to parts of the Northeast
Seaboard.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: SEA OF CLOUDS
</P>
<P>
   Low clouds hovered over much of the Great Lakes region Thursday.
Cumulatively, the Great Lakes act like an inland sea during the
cold season, helping to produce clouds downwind of eastern and
southern shores whenever invading Canadian air is moistened during
transit over relatively warm waters. On Friday, low clouds will
persist over much of the Great Lakes region, particularly the
eastern Great Lakes, as cold air continues to filter south. In
addition, broken bands of snow showers and snow flurries will
develop, one of the first installments in the upcoming season of
lake-effect snows.

 WASHINGTON: impeachment proceedings.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   But whether voters intended to or not, the outcome of the
election has been widely viewed by many Democrats and Republicans
as a referendum on the scope and scale of the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly doesn't make our job any easier,'' said Rep. Bob
Barr, R-Ga., who is one of Clinton's fiercest critics on the
committee. ``There'll be no impact on what we do on the Judiciary
Committee. But other Republicans' view of impeachment will be
colored in by political considerations.''
</P>
<P>
   In light of public resistance to removing Clinton from office,
the slim Republican majority in the House seems to stand little
chance of mustering the 218 votes required for impeachment. ``Some
people are really depressed,'' said a Republican aide. ``It's taken
the wind out of our sails.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats seized on their gain of five seats in the House of
Representatives and polls of voters that showed Americans' strong
desire to end the inquiry now. Rep. John Conyers Jr. of Michigan,
the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said, ``If the
election has made clear one thing it is this: The American people
do not want President Clinton impeached.''
</P>
<P>
   The truncated schedule Hyde described today would abandon plans
to call such central figures as Bruce Lindsey, the presidential
aide, and Vernon Jordan, Clinton's longtime friend and confidant,
although Hyde said more witnesses could be added.
</P>
<P>
   Other committee Republicans praised Hyde's approach. ``Bringing
in witnesses to rehash testimony that's already concretely in the
record would be a waste of time and serve no purpose at all,'' said
Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, only Starr will testify, probably for two days. Starr
has expressed eagerness to defend his four-year, $40 million
inquiry that critics say has turned into a personal vendetta
against the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the center of this inquiry,'' Hyde said at his news
conference in Chicago. ``He's someone everybody wants to hear from,
and we're going to give him that opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats want Starr to testify, to put him on the
defensive. But other Democrats fear Starr could make a compelling
case against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a greater risk for the White House are the 81 questions
Hyde posed on Thursday. Some simply restate the president's job
title: ``Do you admit or deny that you are the chief
law-enforcement officer of the United States of America?''
</P>
<P>
   Other questions ask Clinton to affirm that he met or spoke with
Jordan or Ms. Lewinsky at a particular time on a particular date.
</P>
<P>
   Most go to the heart of the accusations Starr has made. For
example, question No. 27: ``Do you admit or deny that on or about
Dec. 28, 1998, you requested, instructed, suggested to or otherwise
discussed with Betty Currie that she take possession of gifts
previously given to Monica Lewinsky by you?'' Hyde denied the
questions constituted a witch hunt. ``It would be a witch hunt if
we served him with a subpoena to come in, get under oath and
testify to a cross-examination from all members,'' Hyde said.
``That would be pushing the envelope. We're doing it in the most
genteel way.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SHENZHEN, China _ The nation is in a state of decay. The old
moral code has broken down. Corruption is rampant. Crime is rising.
The underpinnings of civil society are collapsing, and gloom is
filling the void.
</P>
<P>
   He Qinglian, a writer whose hot-selling book, ``China's
Pitfalls,'' outlines this apocalyptic view of contemporary China,
is taking on the nation. She attacks wherever she sees darkness,
and that is almost everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one dares say the emperor has no clothes,'' Ms. He said in
a long conversation in this southern Chinese city on a recent
afternoon. ``They are all afraid. But I am not afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. He, 42, laments the terrible problems racking her nation
today, in her writing and her conversation: officials abusing
power, the widening chasm between rich and poor; and the wholesale
robbery of state property that is one result of China's efforts to
shift from a state-run to a market economy.
</P>
<P>
   A quixotic warrior, fighting hopelessly against a tide of
relentless commercial fervor sweeping China: so Ms. He would paint
herself. She certainly is unusual. Most Chinese writers are hemmed
in, not just by publishers afraid of stepping over the line of what
is permissible, but also by the pressure of a society that demands
conformity and attacks individual thinking like a disease. Ms. He
is proud to be different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most accounts of current history are too glowing, too
positive,'' she said, donning a modesty that hides and reappears
over the course of conversation. ``I felt there was a need for
something more realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. He's unblinking look at the stunning scale of official
malfeasance and corruption rings true with ordinary Chinese because
they are so commonplace: the factory head who walks off with a
company's property; the provincial official who determines a fixed
price for each appointment he makes, based on the opportunity for
payoffs; the monopolization of business by the well connected.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. He makes much of what she calls the ``marketization of
power,'' an academic-sounding way of saying that people in
positions of authority are increasingly making money. She also
devotes a large section of her book to the growing gap between rich
and poor.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ms. He's notions are so littered with exaggeration and
pessimism that her punch loses its full force. Not all of the
nation's billions in bank deposits are being squandered, as she
asserts. Not every Chinese official is a crook; nor is moneymaking
limited to officialdom. And not all Chinese people are immoral.
</P>
<P>
   In her voice, beneath the heavy disillusionment with everything
she sees, lurks a hint of a disappointed idealist.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not what reform was supposed to bring,'' Ms. He said,
her voice rising in indignation. ``Deng Xiaoping promised that some
people would get rich first, not that they would get richer and
richer, while the poor get poorer and poorer.''
</P>
<P>
   It may seem silly for anyone, especially an experienced
journalist and trained economist like Ms. He, to have ever believed
the Communist Party line that market capitalism would equally
reward all Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it is hard not to sympathize with her despair
over how the evaporation of Communist beliefs has allowed the party
apparatus to turn into a network of opportunism. ``I see no way
out,'' Ms. He said simply.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   She recalls the idealistic reformers who emerged in China 100
years ago, revolted by the decaying rule of incompetent emperors.
Deflecting the suggestion, she chooses instead to point out that
Chinese thinkers are still stuck where they were in 1898, proposing
the adoption of Western science while preserving Chinese morals.
</P>
<P>
   ``What morals?'' she asked indignantly. ``Chinese people have
few morals. That is the most basic problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. He's assessment of China's recent history seems to ignore
the vast improvements in personal freedom and living standards of
Chinese in all social strata, including writers like herself. But
she brushes away the suggestion that she is being too pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Or that her view is colored by her location. Criticizing China's
reform program from Shenzhen, a freewheeling frontier town
bordering Hong Kong, is like relishing life in Las Vegas while
harping on the excesses of U.S. capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Little more than a village 20 years ago, Shenzhen has since
boomed as a model economic zone. Now a living exhibit of the
extremes of China's economic reform, Shenzhen is overflowing with
banks, private enterprise, prostitutes and con men.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. He moved here 10 years ago from Shanghai, where she
completed a degree in economics. She has worked as a reporter at
The Shenzhen Legal News for the last five years. ``I don't
particularly like Shenzhen, but it is where I ended up,'' Ms. He
said. ``I feel very much like an observer, an outsider here.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamenting the decline of morality and the flowering of adultery,
Ms. He believes that China's basic problems are rooted in
immorality and a lack of family structure. Like many urban Chinese,
she and her husband put their only child, a 6-year-old son, in a
sleep-away school, and see him one night a week.
</P>
<P>
   Nine publishers shied away from Ms. He's manuscript in 1996 when
she first presented it, saying it was too critical. It was finally
published last January after a version of the book appeared in Hong
Kong and then won the direct endorsement of Liu Ji, a professor and
one of President Jiang Zemin's closest advisers.
</P>
<P>
   The leadership's approval of this book is interesting, too.
Jiang and his advisers want to portray him as opposing the
corruption in China. They want to use a limited amount of criticism
of real problems, as long as it does not blame the leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not criticizing leaders, I'm criticizing the system,'' Ms.
He said. ``Even the best leader can't thrive in a bad system.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides,'' she added after a pause, ``criticizing leaders
would limit my ability to speak freely.''
</P>
<P>
   Although her book has attracted attention in a relatively small
corner of the intelligentsia, it sold out its initial print run of
30,000 in the first month. Another 20,000 copies were printed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then the pirating began,'' she said. ``Several times more have
been printed that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. He said she is uncomfortable with the attention her book _
not yet translated into English _ has attracted in the West. After
an essay about it by Liu Binyan and Perry Link appeared in The New
York Review of Books, she feared that it would be misrepresented by
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to take what they want out of your book,''
she said, adding wearily, ``There's nothing you can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet people are not welcome to take her name; Ms. He is suing a
publisher who used her name on a book she did not write.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I feel I don't understand China at all,'' Ms. He
summed up. ``The more I look at it, the less I understand.''

 &HT;    Space experiment could help with cancer treatment
 &HT;    By Dick Stanley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ One of the biggest problems with treating cancer
is that as cancer cells grow they often develop resistance to the
drugs used against them, similar to the way bacteria may evolve
resistance to antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   But in several years of cell experiments aboard the space
shuttle, researchers at the University of Texas and their
colleagues elsewhere have found that cells don't develop resistance
when they grow in the microgravity of low Earth orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, as part of his return to space this week, U.S. Sen. John
Glenn has been conducting an experiment on the shuttle Discovery to
grow white blood cells for drug resistance studies. The experiment
is being conducted in conjunction with a similar experiment on the
ground in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   It has long been a plot device in science fiction to have a
character be sent into space for some form of cancer therapy that
won't work on the ground. But as expensive as most cancer therapies
are, they would be prohibitively so if a seat on a space shuttle
had to be included in the price.
</P>
<P>
   So Edward Piepmeier, a UT assistant professor of pharmacy, and
his colleagues at the University of South Carolina and the
University of Alabama are hoping to learn enough about why cells
grow differently in space to defeat drug resistance on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually all kinds of cancer may become resistant to drugs in
two ways,'' said Piepmeier, who helped devise the experiments Glenn
is doing. ``They can spit out the drugs through proteins they
develop on their membranes, or others of their proteins can
metabolize the drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Cancer drugs used in cell experiments on previous shuttle
flights didn't get spit out or metabolized. Instead, they remained
effective.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers looking at the new cancer drug Taxol, for instance,
might focus on the cytoskeleton, or structure of a cell, which
doesn't form as readily in space as it does on the ground. Studying
such differences may help researchers figure out how to avoid
resistance to Taxol.
</P>
<P>
   The space experiment, which Glenn has operated during this
week's flight, involves a four-syringe apparatus that feeds growth
nutrients to white blood cells, allows them to divide and grow and
then fixes the results with a formaldehyde solution for later
study.
</P>
<P>
   Each time Glenn has pushed one of the syringes aboard Discovery,
Marian Lewis, a National Aeronautics and Space Administration
biologist, has done the same with a similar setup at the Kennedy
Space Center in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is done identically, at the same time, in space and
on the ground, so we know what's caused by microgravity and what
isn't,'' Piepmeier said.
</P>
<P>
   After Discovery lands in Florida on Saturday, some of the cells
grown in space, and those grown on the ground, will be shipped to
Texas, Alabama and South Carolina for evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Piepmeier doesn't expect definitive results right away. He and
his colleagues have a similar experiment planned for a shuttle
flight next spring.

AND THIS LITTLE PIGGY GETS TO STAY HOME 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RON NISSIMOV 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ An appellate court ruled Thursday that Whoopi the
Vietnamese pot-bellied pig can continue to live in the Inverness
Forest subdivision, north of Houston, overturning a lower court
ruling that said the pig must go.
</P>
<P>
   Whoopi's owner Ed Malmgren was willing to spend a lot of bacon
to keep the 7-year-old pig at his house in the 900 block of Pear
Tree, where he has lived since 1967.
</P>
<P>
   If the 1st District Court of Appeals had ruled against Malmgren,
he would have had to pay $47,500 in attorneys' fees to the
Inverness Forest Residents Civic Club, in addition to his own fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been worth it,'' Malmgren, 59, said. ``I can't
take my money with me, but I can take my integrity with me.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if I didn't have $48,000 to spend I might have had
different thoughts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Malmgren, who runs a small metal forging plant and two other
businesses, said it is unfortunate that people who are less
well-off would not have been able to buy justice for their pets.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Gordon, the attorney for the association, declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Malmgren, a bachelor for 20 years, said he bought Whoopi as a
piglet in November 1991 from a farm in Navasota, Texas, after
seeing that ``movie stars got them (pot-bellied pigs).''
</P>
<P>
   He first named her ``Julie Belle,'' after an unusually fertile
sow he raised while growing up in a farm near Peoria, Ill. But one
of his Houston neighbors with a very similar name ``thought I was
tormenting her,'' so Malmgren's son Greg renamed the pig Whoopi.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until late 1995 that a long-standing board member of
the association knocked on Malmgren's door ``and challenged me,
saying he's the almighty and that I better get rid of the pig,''
Malmgren said.
</P>
<P>
   A few months after the encounter, the civic association sued in
a justice of the peace court.
</P>
<P>
   The deed restriction of the 450-home association says, ``The
raising of hogs, horses, poultry, fowls, or other livestock on any
part of the subdivision is prohibited.''
</P>
<P>
   Malmgren went hog wild, saying the restriction was being
selectively enforced because ``canaries are fowls'' but are allowed
to happily chirp away in people's homes.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, he said Whoopi, who is spayed, is not livestock
because she was not being raised for breeding or slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Malmgren is not shy about his feelings. A sign on his lawn says,
``Homeowner protests selective and unequal enforcement of Inverness
Forest Deed Restrictions _ Oink if you agree.''
</P>
<P>
   The justice of the peace court ordered the two sides to
mediation, and Malmgren said he offered to settle if the
association would grandfather Whoopi from the restriction and
rewrite its rules.
</P>
<P>
   The association refused, dropping its suit in the lower court
and refiling it in state district court in April 1996. State
District Judge John Devine granted the association's motion for a
summary judgment before the matter reached trial.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court never ruled on the issue of whether pet pigs
are livestock, saying the state district suit was filed too late by
the civic association. Under the statute of limitations, the
association only had four years to file the suit after first
finding out about the pig, the court ruled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of Malmgren's neighbors testified (in an appellate
hearing) they knew about Whoopi since November 1991, when Malmgren
first acquired her,'' the ruling said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the court's ruling said, a former civic association
block captain coordinator ``distinctly remembered watching Whoopi
eat watermelon when Malmgren first acquired her in 1991.''
</P>
<P>
   Malmgren's lawyer David Furlow said no Texas appellate court has
ruled on whether pet pigs should be considered livestock, but in
three other states courts have ruled they are not.
</P>
<P>
   Malmgren said he will ask Devine to order the association to pay
his attorney's fees, which he declined to disclose.
</P>
<P>
   However, Malmgren said that if the judge awards him his fees,
every family in the subdivision will end up paying between $100 to
$200 in the failed effort to remove Whoopi.
</P>
<P>
   Malgrem, who owns a copy of ``Babe,'' the movie that features an
impossibly cute pig that saves the day, said pigs are intelligent
and clean animals, and people who do not think they should be pets
are ``prejudiced.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Whoopi often sleeps on a recliner in his living room,
which is decorated with several stuffed pigs and pig trinkets, much
like the rest of the house. During the day while Malmgren is at
work, Whoopi happily hangs out with Malmgren's dog and cat. The pig
takes care of her business in a litter box, he said, and only eats
about a pound of feed a day.
</P>
<P>
   But ``even Whoopi likes a good ham bone every now and then,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Malmgren said he doesn't know exactly how much Whoopi weighs,
but it is much less than the several-hundred pound pigs he raised
on the farm. He said he was pleasantly surprised to learn Whoopi's
life expectancy is 25 years, because when he was a boy ``we always
sent old boars and sows to the market after they were 10 years old.
I assumed that's how long they lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been this way all my life, right is right and wrong is
wrong,'' Malmgren said about his willingness to stand up for his
pig. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. _ In the office of Daniel Jordan, president
of the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation at mountaintop
Monticello here, a stark black and white drawing of Jefferson
stares from the wall. The nose is thin, aristocratic, the eyes
dark, enigmatic, the mouth sealed in a thin line, offering nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 200 people trying to keep up with one man _ one dead
man,'' said Jordan, a tall, white-haired, distinguished-looking
Southerner from Philadelphia, Miss. ``And we will never catch
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Here at the research foundation that oversees Jefferson's home
and conducts tours _ really walking historical lectures _ of both
the house and the life of the United States' third president,
compelling DNA evidence that he fathered at least one child with a
slave, Sally Hemings, has given tour guides one new piece of
information to pass along, and has stirred up countless new
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those questions, tied to the nature of that
relationship, are disturbing: Was it a loving or even willing
relationship? Or one of ugliness, of a master and his slave? And
why did Jefferson never seem to acknowledge the child, a son, in
any familial way, or even with any particular fondness?
</P>
<P>
   ``My immediate reaction was to be reminded of just how vicious,
abominable and complex the institution of slavery was,'' said
Jordan of the DNA evidence.
</P>
<P>
   If the evidence is correct, ``it shows us the exploitive side of
slavery,'' Jordan said. That much, he added, is not in question.
</P>
<P>
   But questions there are. One possibility is that the two were
bound in ``a tragic love story,'' he said. ``The other is one of
brutal exploitation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We know more than anybody,'' he said, ``and we don't know
anything about the nature of that relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, he said, it humanizes Jefferson, and allows
historians to paint a richer picture of him.
</P>
<P>
   Both Jordan and the tour guides have, for years, included the
possibility of such a relationship in their discussions, though the
offspring identified in the DNA testing was not the Hemings son
they had so long guessed it might be.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure did not send historians here scrambling to
rewrite history _ the staff here will now go to work trying to
verify, academically, the scientific evidence, Jordan said _ and
will not drastically alter how guides at Monticello do their job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we've always discussed,'' said Jean Myer, who
has been giving tours of Monticello for six years. That Jefferson,
who owned slaves even as he wrote the Declaration of Independence
and said all men are created equal, might have engaged in a sexual
relationship with Hemings and fathered a son is part of his
history, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to say, `Nature intended me for the tranquil pursuit
of science, by rendering it my supreme delight,''' Ms. Myer added.
``Now, here we are with a scientific development that gives us an
insight into his life. Certainly, we will acknowledge that.''
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Harriman, who takes visitors on tours of the home and
plantation, including the slave quarters known as Mulberry Row,
said her lectures on Jefferson the family man might be altered by
the DNA findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jefferson was always such a family man,'' she said. ``Now we
find he may have had another child, on Mulberry Row. How did he
look on that child?''
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence, at least in his writings and through other
research, that he ever acknowledged having the child.
</P>
<P>
   The DNA evidence, Ms. Harriman said, will not alter the public
image of the man but may change the way people look at his role as
a father.
</P>
<P>
   If the DNA evidence is correct, ``he had a double standard,''
said Robert Gillespie, a lawyer in Richmond and a Jefferson
descendant. Jefferson gave Martha and Maria, his two daughters by
his wife, Martha, ``love and attention,'' said Gillespie, who heads
the Monticello Association, made up of Jefferson's descendants.
</P>
<P>
   If he treated the Hemings child with any familial love, there
seems to be no evidence of it in accounts by his slaves, collected
after his death, of life at Monticello.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reservations Jefferson had for ending slavery was
that emancipation would lead to a mixing of the races.
</P>
<P>
   Now, all of this will have to be cast in a different light by
the tour guides, who will form their own interpretations. The
tours, which take some 550,000 people a year through the house, are
not scripted, Jordan said, although the guides are expected to keep
them historically accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think we are hiding something,'' he said. ``We're not.
We say all we know. Within 24 hours of learning about the DNA
evidence, our guides were talking about it. You follow the truth
where it leads.''
</P>
<P>
   The report that brought about this information, from blood
samples collected by Eugene Foster of Charlottesville, a retired
professor of pathology at Tufts University, indicates strongly that
Eston Hemings, Sally Hemings' youngest son, had unusual Y
chromosome mutations, the same as in the Jefferson lineage.
</P>
<P>
   Historians have long debated whether Jefferson or some of his
relatives fathered a child with Hemings because of a striking
resemblance to the Jeffersons in an older son, Thomas Hemings. The
DNA evidence seems to confirm a sexual relationship with Hemings,
but it points to Thomas' younger brother Eston.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists at Monticello, who tend to be people already interested
in history, said the DNA evidence did not surprise them, that they
had heard of a relationship between Jefferson and Hemings and would
have been more surprised if there had not been a child.
</P>
<P>
   No one said they thought less of Jefferson the hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't change my opinion of him at all,'' said Richard
Green, a tourist from Silver Spring, Md., who works for Adventist
World Radio of the Seventh-day Adventist Church there. ``It just
shows me that he's human like the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The DNA evidence could lead to physical changes at Monticello.
Only those of the Jefferson lineage have been allowed to be buried
in the family cemetery, which is controlled not by the foundation
but by his descendants, through the Monticello Association.
</P>
<P>
   Gillespie, who heads the Monticello Association, said the voting
members _ from 700 to 800 _ may now vote to ``extend burial rights
to the others.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he believed that the high ideals that his ancestor put
down on paper would live on, as would Jefferson's legacy as a
national hero.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said he believed that in the long run, this new
information would only help make Jefferson more real, more a living
person instead of the enigmatic icon.
</P>
<P>
   He does not hope to ever understand him, Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he said, ``I have always found him good company.''

U.S. ENVOY PLEADS FOR END TO CONGO WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By IAN FISHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ A top U.S. diplomat ended a weeklong trip to
Africa Thursday by again urging a political solution to the war in
Congo, which has drawn in neighboring countries and threatens to
become a larger regional conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a strong desire on the part of literally everyone we
talked to for peace,'' the diplomat, Susan Rice, assistant
secretary of state for african affairs, said Thursday evening in a
telephone interview from Zambia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The frustrating aspect, and the irony, is that as much as
everyone wants peace, everybody is prepared to keep fighting unless
peace can be found on the basis of a formula that all find broadly
acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   The open question after her at-times stormy visit to seven
African countries, five of which are fighting in Congo or are
widely suspected to be involved, is what exactly might create that
peace. Ms. Rice emphasized that devising such a plan was not the
goal of the trip, which she said was purely ``consultative.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact the delegation pointedly avoided any public discussion
of concrete solutions, saying it broadly supported efforts by other
African nations like South Africa and Zambia for a cease-fire and
the removal of foreign troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's hard to envision, but we really did not come here
with a fantasy that we're going to shake our finger at these actors
and tie this thing up in a bow,'' said Gayle Smith, senior director
for african affairs at the National Security Council, who traveled
with Ms. Rice.
</P>
<P>
   The rebellion in Congo, formerly known as Zaire, began on Aug.
2. From the start it was not confined to the forces that were
trying to overthrow President Laurent Kabila, who took power in a
similar rebellion last year. It is almost universally assumed that
neighboring Rwanda and Uganda are involved, in part to secure their
borders from rebel groups based in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Uganda concedes it has troops in Congo to protect its borders,
but denies a role in the rebellion. Rwanda has completely denied
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila has cast the rebellion as an ``invasion'' by those two
nations and found military support from Angola, Namibia, Chad and,
particularly, Zimbabwe, which has sent several thousand combat
troops. President Robert Mugabe has seemed ever more militant about
the role of Zimbabwe in Congo, even though he faced huge protests
at home against that effort.
</P>
<P>
   Several rounds of peace talks have failed, and Kabila refuses to
speak with the rebels, who call themselves the Congolese Rally for
Democracy. On Thursday the foreign minister of South Africa, which
has been promoting a peace plan, warned that the situation was
becoming graver.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this conflict is not stopped the danger of a massive
African war is a reality,'' Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad said in
Cape Town.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Friday, South African President Nelson Mandela is to hold
another meeting with the most powerful politician in Rwanda, Vice
President Paul Kagame, and will reportedly push for a plan that
calls for Rwanda to admit its role. That admission, according to
published reports, would be aimed at a cease-fire, followed by the
withdrawal of foreign troops and the arrival of a peacekeeping
force that would help protect the Uganda and Rwanda borders.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. delegation has not endorsed any particular plan. Ms.
Rice said her role was to listen to each nation and repeat what the
United States has said from the start are its base-line goals: a
cease-fire and the withdrawal of foreign troops.
</P>
<P>
   Starting last Wednesday she visited Kabila in Kinshasa, the
capital, and stopped in South Africa, Angola, Zimbabwe, Rwanda,
Uganda and Zambia, whose president, Frederick Chiluba, has been
sponsoring peace talks. She visited Chiluba Thursday for a second
time before returning home.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rice did not receive a warm welcome from Mugabe, who kept
her waiting for several hours, or President Jose Eduardo dos Santos
of Angola, who said he could not see her because of a scheduling
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night she met four members of the rebellion
movement in Kigali, the capital of Rwanda. In an interview Thursday
the president of the rebels, Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, described the
talks as useful but declined to give details.

HEAD OF IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY ASKS CLINTON WHETHER HE LIED UNDER
OATH 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Forging ahead with an impeachment inquiry that most
Americans say Congress should drop, Rep. Henry Hyde on Thursday
asked President Clinton to say flatly whether he lied under oath,
tampered with witnesses, or obstructed justice.
</P>
<P>
   In a nine-page letter, Hyde, chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, asked Clinton to admit or deny 81 selected findings
gleaned from the Whitewater independent counsel's 445-page report
on the president's affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The Illinois Republican said the president could speed the
process along by not disputing the findings. But many of the
questions are pointed and ask Clinton to admit to accusations that
the president and his advisers have strenuously denied since the
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, sent his scathing report to
Congress. Take question No. 21, for instance:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you admit or deny that you gave false and misleading
testimony under oath when you stated during your deposition in the
case of Jones v. Clinton on January 17, 1998, that you did not know
if Monica Lewinsky had been subpoenaed to testify in that case?''
</P>
<P>
   Answering ``yes'' to questions like this, Hyde said, would help
him wrap up the inquiry by year's end. ``The cooperation we'd like
is to admit facts that are already, we think, established in the
record. That gets us from here to there rather quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers declined to comment Thursday night on Hyde's
letter, but they are certain to balk at many of the conclusions
drawn straight from Starr's report that they consider woefully
biased.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``At the appropriate time, in the appropriate way, we will say
whatever we intend to say,'' Clinton told reporters during a
meeting with Democratic congressional leaders at the White House.
``The important thing is that we've got to get back to doing the
people's business.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Chicago, Hyde described the letter to
Clinton as he outlined the schedule for the inquiry against
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde on Thursday underscored his goal to wrap up the inquiry by
year's end, announcing that the committee would likely summon only
one witness, Starr, on Nov. 19.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the shock waves from Democratic gains in midterm elections
have injected new doubts and uncertainty into the impeachment
process, lawmakers said on Thursday. And any alternative to
impeachment, such as censure, has been complicated by the
leadership fight that has broken out among House Republicans in
recriminations over Tuesday's debacle.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said on Thursday that the election would have ``no
significant impact'' on the impeachment proceedings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But whether voters intended to or not, the outcome of the
election has been widely viewed by many Democrats and Republicans
as a referendum on the scope and scale of the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly doesn't make our job any easier,'' said Rep. Bob
Barr, R-Ga., who is one of Clinton's fiercest critics on the
committee. ``There'll be no impact on what we do on the Judiciary
Committee. But other Republicans' view of impeachment will be
colored in by political considerations.''
</P>
<P>
   In light of public resistance to removing Clinton from office,
the slim Republican majority in the House seems to stand little
chance of mustering the 218 votes required for impeachment. ``Some
people are really depressed,'' said a Republican aide. ``It's taken
the wind out of our sails.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats seized on their gain of five seats in the House of
Representatives and polls of voters that showed Americans' strong
desire to end the inquiry now. Rep. John Conyers Jr. of Michigan,
the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said, ``If the
election has made clear one thing it is this: The American people
do not want President Clinton impeached.''
</P>
<P>
   The truncated schedule Hyde described today would abandon plans
to call such central figures as Bruce Lindsey, the presidential
aide, and Vernon Jordan, Clinton's longtime friend and confidant,
although Hyde said more witnesses could be added.
</P>
<P>
   Other committee Republicans praised Hyde's approach. ``Bringing
in witnesses to rehash testimony that's already concretely in the
record would be a waste of time and serve no purpose at all,'' said
Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, only Starr will testify, probably for two days. Starr
has expressed eagerness to defend his four-year, $40 million
inquiry that critics say has turned into a personal vendetta
against the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the center of this inquiry,'' Hyde said at his news
conference in Chicago. ``He's someone everybody wants to hear from,
and we're going to give him that opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats want Starr to testify, to put him on the
defensive. But other Democrats fear Starr could make a compelling
case against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a greater risk for the White House are the 81 questions
Hyde posed on Thursday. Some simply restate the president's job
title: ``Do you admit or deny that you are the chief
law-enforcement officer of the United States of America?''
</P>
<P>
   Other questions ask Clinton to affirm that he met or spoke with
Jordan or Ms. Lewinsky at a particular time on a particular date.
</P>
<P>
   Most go to the heart of the accusations Starr has made. For
example, question No. 27: ``Do you admit or deny that on or about
Dec. 28, 1998, you requested, instructed, suggested to or otherwise
discussed with Betty Currie that she take possession of gifts
previously given to Monica Lewinsky by you?'' Hyde denied the
questions constituted a witch hunt. ``It would be a witch hunt if
we served him with a subpoena to come in, get under oath and
testify to a cross-examination from all members,'' Hyde said.
``That would be pushing the envelope. We're doing it in the most
genteel way.''

GOP MOST AFFECTED BY LOWEST TURNOUT SINCE '42, STUDY SAYS

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fewer eligible Americans _ 36 percent _ voted on
Tuesday than in any election since 1942 when the nation was at war,
according to a study made public Thursday based on unofficial
voting figures.
</P>
<P>
   The examination, by the Committee for the Study of the American
Electorate, raises serious doubts about the longheld notion that
core Republican voters can be counted on to be more energized about
voting _ and that therefore low turnout benefits Republican
candidates. This year, Democrats capitalized on the expected low
turnout and were particularly successful at persuading blacks,
union members and women to go to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election perhaps nailed the coffin on the belief that low
turnout benefits the GOP,'' said Curtis Gans, director of the
committee, a nonpartisan group.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout was down substantially in New York and California, for
instance, and the Democrats wrested the California governor's seat
and a New York Senate seat from Republicans in two hotly contested
races.
</P>
<P>
   This dwindling participation capped an election season
overshadowed by President Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky. On
the television networks this year, there were roughly six news
stories about the scandal for every one story about electoral
politics, according to an analysis by S. Robert Lichter, president
of the Center for Media and Public Affairs in Washington. He said
there were 73 percent fewer stories on the networks about the
elections than during the midterm campaign four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Lichter found that ABC, NBC and CBS collectively devoted 11
hours and 49 minutes to the Lewinsky case from Sept. 7 through Nov.
2. In that same period, the networks allotted two hours and 26
minutes to the conflict in Kosovo; two hours and 18 minutes to the
elections, and two hours and six minutes to Sen. John Glenn's
return to space.
</P>
<P>
   The dip in turnout came in the face of a nearly 8 million
increase in the number of Americans eligible to vote _ and a 4
million increase in those registered, according to Gans. In all, an
estimated 72.5 million (72,500,000) Americans voted on Tuesday,
down more than 2.5 million from 1994. And the largest number of
eligible Americans in history opted not to vote, estimated at
119.45 million (119,450,000).
</P>
<P>
   The highest turnout of any state _ 59.5 percent of eligible
voters _ was recorded in Minnesota, where Jesse Ventura, the former
pro wrestler and Reform Party candidate, was elected governor.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in turnout affected Republicans the most.
Republicans accounted for an 18 percent share of the eligible vote,
compared with 22 percent in 1994. Democrats suffered more modest
loses; the party's turnout was 16.8 percent, compared with 18.9
percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve states saw higher turnout, and in eight of those states
the most competitive races were won by Democrats: Maryland,
Georgia, South Carolina, Hawaii, Louisiana, Wisconsin and North
Carolina. But at least 36 states and the District of Columbia
reported lower turnout.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout declined in every region of the nation except the
Midwest. And Gans said ``one of the sad findings'' is that turnout
is diminishing appreciably in the South. Until recently, he said,
the South ``helped keep turnout from falling to truly historic
levels by virtue of the enfranchisement of blacks and the
development of a two-party system.''
</P>
<P>
   Gans said the slashing attack commercials in the New York Senate
race, where Rep. Charles Schumer, a Democrat, ousted Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato, contributed to a historic low in the state's turnout.
``Voters were so turned off,'' he said, ``that Gov. George Pataki's
one-sided victory had a higher turnout than the senatorial
battle.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest increases in turnout occurred in four states with
particularly tight contests: Kentucky (an increase of 10.7
percentage points), Minnesota (up 6.8 percentage points), North
Carolina (up 5.1 points) and Wisconsin (up 4.2 points.)
</P>
<P>
   Among the lowest turnouts in states with statewide contests were
Oregon (18.2 percent), Tennessee (23.6 percent), Arizona (25.8
percent), Texas (26.2 percent) and Louisiana (30.8 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Another estimate of turnout put the overall percentage at
slightly higher than Gans', at 37 percent. That figure was from
Voter News Service, a consortium of the television networks and The
Associated Press, and was based on surveys of 50,000 voters leaving
the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The VNS study estimated that turnout was slightly higher among
men than women; it also found that 37.6 percent of white voters and
29.6 percent of black voters went to the polls. Among age groups,
the survey found that turnout was highest _ 51.7 percent _ for
people ages 45 to 64.

U.S. SUING LOUISIANA ON PRISON ILLS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By FOX BUTTERFIELD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Justice Department filed suit Thursday accusing the state of
Louisiana, widely believed to have the worst juvenile prisons in
the nation, with failing to protect youthful inmates from brutality
by guards and providing inadequate education, medical and mental
health care.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, to force the state to improve conditions, is an
unusually forceful action by the Justice Department. It follows two
years of investigation by department experts and unsuccessful
negotiations with the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and
Corrections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is incredibly unusual,'' said David Utter, director of the
Juvenile Justice Project of Louisiana, which has also filed suit
against Louisiana over conditions at one of its four juvenile
prisons, the privately owned Tallulah Correctional Center for
Youth. ``I don't even know when the Justice Department ever filed
suit against a state in a case like this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past two years, the Justice Department has repeatedly
advised state officials of the specific deficiencies and the
corrective action needed,'' the department said. ``The state has
failed or refused to address the Justice Department's findings in
many critical ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Stalder, the secretary of Louisiana's Department of
Public Safety and Corrections was traveling Thursday and could not
be reached for comment. A spokesman for his office said he would
have no comment, because the department had yet to receive a copy
of the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana has repeatedly insisted that it has tried to make
changes in the four juvenile prisons and that the federal
investigators have exaggerated the troubles. The owners of Tallulah
have also complained that the improvements demanded by the Justice
Department would be so expensive it would put them out of business.
</P>
<P>
   With Thursday's action, the Justice Department will join the
suit by Utter's group, as well as another suit dating to the early
1980s, in a case scheduled to be tried in federal district court in
Baton Rouge in February. Utter's group is an offshoot of the
Southern Poverty Law Center.
</P>
<P>
   Another lawyer, Scott Wolleson of Monroe, La., is also planning
to file a suit on behalf of up to 50 young inmates at Tallulah
seeking damages for injuries they sustained in beatings by guards,
including broken cheek bones and punctured ear drums.
</P>
<P>
   Tallulah is operated by Trans-American Development Associates,
which is owned by several close friends of former Gov. Edwin
Edwards. Trans-American was named as a defendant in the suit filed
by the Justice Department Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana officials took over temporary management of Tallulah
in July after Justice Department investigators reported high levels
of brutality and an almost total lack of education or care for the
large number of inmates suffering from severe mental illness. At
the time, the state sent in a new team of guards from its adult
prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Utter said some of the brutality had decreased, but there were
also new reports that the state guards were occasionally more
violent than the private guards they replaced.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, said Shannon Robshaw, executive director of the
Mental Health Association of Louisiana, there had been no
improvement in education or medical or mental health care at
Tallulah since the state took over. In fact, Ms. Robshaw said, she
had received a report that one mentally ill boy, who was hearing
voices, had stuck broken glass in his ears but had not been given
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   As an indication of how unusual the Justice Department suit is,
department officials noted that in recent years they had also
investigated conditions at juvenile prisons in Kentucky, Puerto
Rico and Georgia, and had subsequently reached agreement with each
on improving the problems that had been found.
</P>
<P>
   ``As in all cases,'' said Bill Lann Lee, the acting assistant
Attorney General for Civil Rights, ``we had hoped to resolve this
matter short of contested litigation. At the moment, however, it is
clear that federal court action is the only way to protect
juveniles in Louisiana's secure correctional facilities from
unlawful conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Robshaw said the action of the Justice Department in joining
the lawsuit ``is extremely significant,'' providing further
momentum and legal resources for the team of public interest and
private lawyers already pursuing the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a profound statement of the magnitude of the
problem and the state's refusal to address its deficiencies,'' she
said.

 WASHINGTON: embattled party.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many Republicans immediately blamed Gingrich for the party's
losses on Tuesday. Talk quickly emerged the next day of a slate of
candidates to oppose Gingrich and his lieutenants. The list of
possible candidates for leadership positions included Rep. Steve
Largent of Oklahoma, who talked with Livingston on Thursday about
challenging Gingrich, Republican officials said, speaking on the
condition that their names not be reported.
</P>
<P>
   Those officials said that Largent told Livingston that he wanted
to run with him on a ticket and that he would challenge Rep. Dick
Armey, the majority leader. But, Largent reportedly said that if
Livingston did not challenge Gingrich, Largent would run for
speaker instead.
</P>
<P>
   Other names surfaced on Thursday for leadership posts. They
included Reps David McIntosh of Indiana for speaker and Jennifer
Dunn of Washington as conference chairman.
</P>
<P>
   As a sign of the uncertainty prevailing among House members on
Thursday, Rep. Henry Hyde, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee
and one of the House's most venerable members, rebuffed a chance to
endorse Gingrich as speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said that Gingrich bore responsibility for the party's
losses Tuesday. ``Leadership takes credit when things go right,''
he said. ``They ought to take the blame when things go wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Gingrich should remain speaker, Hyde said: ``I rather
think he will, but that remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The energy that many vented publicly on Wednesday as anger
toward Gingrich seemed devoted on Thursday to intense internal
political calculations about whether Livingston could succeed in
toppling Gingrich and whether he should succeed.
</P>
<P>
   While many support him as a veteran who understands the House
and has shown shrewd political skills in managing the massive
federal budget, others are reviving images of the Louisianan as a
hot-head who gave the party a bad name during the government
shutdown two years ago and who tends toward arm-flailing in heated
moments.
</P>
<P>
   One conservative leader said that he and his allies had
reservations about Livingston because he was ``obsessed'' about
trying to keep social issues out of the budget process. The budget,
he said, ``has been a vehicle for conservatives over the years to
add restrictions on federal money for abortion and other things you
can't get through the Senate or past a presidential veto. If
Livingston is the challenger, I doubt that will cause a rallying of
the real conservatives in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Some moderates said they were prepared to support him. Rep.
Marge Roukema, R-N.J., said, ``I would be amenable to Livingston.''
Still, she cautioned, ``I'm not after Newt. But it's wrong not to
sit down and seriously look at our options.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Johnson, an aide to Rep. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin, R-La.,, said
that his boss was ``emblematic'' of the confusion among the broad
base of House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy has been loyal to both Speaker Gingrich and Dick Armey,
and he's still loyal to them, but he also wants to hear what they
have to say before committing to them in the next election,''
Johnson said. ``Everyone is asking the same question: Can we
refocus the message and re-energize our base without re-aligning
the leadership?''
</P>
<P>
   With the challenge under way, Gingrich has been trying to show
members that he is responsive to their concerns. After an election
night in which he portrayed the Republicans as victorious even as
they lost seats, the next day he took ``responsibility'' for the
losses. In another move, Gingrich has indicated that he is willing
to cede control over the party's congressional campaign committee,
allowing the whole House to select its members.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich is also making strong personal appeals to Republicans.
Said one top House aide: ``He'll get support. How much? Only his
own vote-counters know.''

INSIDE HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL'S THURSDAY NIGHT LIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The sight of a 35-foot television truck squeezing
through the narrow service roads on the Canoga Park High campus
Thursday afternoon as it headed for the dirt track next to the
football field could have easily caused a commotion.
</P>
<P>
   But almost like another rocket launch, what teen-ager isn't used
to seeing a TV truck these days? Even when it's there to televise a
couple of rival teams playing on their field.
</P>
<P>
   It's nearly seven hours before kickoff, but the groundwork for
Thursday night's El Camino Real-Taft game on Fox Sports West 2
already had started in earnest. Eighteen crew members were
uncoiling cables, uncrating cameras and winding wires around the
grass field to transform the otherwise unassuming piece of land
into a temporary outdoor TV studio.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few hours, there'd be 30 members of the production team
on site, including announcers Jim Watkins and John Jackson. And
when the game ends at about 10 p.m., they'll all disappear in about
an hour.
</P>
<P>
   (Actually, Pacific Bell workers were there the day before to
install additional phone lines and set up the transmitter equipment
for Fox's production).
</P>
<P>
   A group of students from a P.E. class jog around the track at
about 2 p.m., but otherwise don't notice the casually dressed
technical folk unless they have to hurdle over a wire or avoid a
forklift. Only the sheep and chickens penned across the way that
belonged to the school's Future Farmers of America club seemed to
be making noise about what was going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of ways, this set-up is more interesting to watch
than before a Lakers or Dodgers game,'' said Micah King, the game's
producer who looks no older than one of the Canoga Park High
students.
</P>
<P>
   King, a 27-year-old Long Beach State grad, has been working on
the Fox Sports pregame shows for the Lakers and Dodgers, where all
the trucks have to do is pull in, plug in and do a show. King
appreciates the opportunity to do a live sporting event, which is
what he aspires to do as a full-time career.
</P>
<P>
   The reason this comes off looking like a college-quality
telecast on TV has a lot to do with the equipment put into these
shows by Fox, in its second year of a deal with the CIF to televise
a football game of the week.
</P>
<P>
   If ratings for these games appear as nothing more than a blip on
the cable ratings radar, it serves many purposes for Fox to do
them. It's file footage of local stars who eventually go on to play
for USC or UCLA and can be used on either school's half-hour sports
shows. Games are picked up on satellite dishes by recruiters as
well as media members who vote in national polls. Even a live game,
like the Mater Dei-De La Salle contest earlier this year, is of
interest to the Fox Bay Area regional outlet.
</P>
<P>
   And, as was the case Thursday night, it fills a programming
void. Before the NBA lockout, a Clippers game had been penciled,
which would have forced the El Camino Real-Taft game to a delayed
broadcast. Instead, high school football went live.
</P>
<P>
   King, who has rotated this season on the FSW2 high school
football game of the week with John Heffner and Dave Frederick,
knows this is just as much a hands-on experience for him as it is
for much of the crew manning the cameras and loading the graphics.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us are the front-line guys,'' said King without
sounding condescending. ``Everyone here has had limited experience,
so this really is learning on the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Technical director Ismael Soto finds the most interesting part
of these games is when high school students come by during the
telecast to look in the truck at all the monitors, or talk to the
cameramen about what they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The students love to poke around; it's just like getting job
information for them,'' said Soto, who has worked on half the games
this season. ``These schools bend over backward to help us out
anyway. Many go beyond the call of duty.''
</P>
<P>
   Added King: ``I never had this kind of access when I was in high
school. All I ever saw was the big truck outside. I never knew what
was in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, how one of those rigs could ever make it through a narrow
gate on a high-school campus.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT SMOKES
</P>
<P>
   _NFL profiteer Michael Ovitz comes off as a ``very compelling,
bright, charming guy who has a vision and a reputation for making
dreams happen,'' said reporter !racepay!Tom Murray, whose two-part
interview with the man trying to bring football to Carson airs
during the new episode of ``Goin' Deep'' magazine show for Fox
Sports Net (airing on Fox Sports West at 9 p.m. Sunday).
</P>
<P>
   _New Jersey Nets never-at-a-loss-for-worry forward Jayson
Williams and teammate Keith Van Horn are guests tonight (11:30
p.m.) on HBO's ``Chris Rock Show'' to talk about the NBA labor
situation. On CBS' ``Late Show'' with David Letterman on Wednesday,
Williams blurted out about NBA commissioner David Stern: ``Good
guy, great guy, brilliant guy, but did you see his new beard? Here
goes a 5-foot-2 inch Jewish guy, right, sitting across the table
from 7-foot black guys from the ghetto and he's cutting off their
million dollar checks every month _ and he thinks he's scaring them
with that beard. You got to come better than that Dave.''
</P>
<P>
   _NBA players have been muttering about a boycott of NBC and
Turner during the lockout, calling them co-conspirators since both
TV networks will soon pay the owners rights fees even with canceled
games. To which Dick Schaap said on ESPN's ``The Sports
Reporters'': ``Does this mean Michael Jordan is no longer going to
confide in Ahmad Rashad? How are we going to get Michael's
innermost thoughts with Ahmad's probing questions? How will
journalism survive?''
</P>
<P>
   _Mike Lupica's show on ESPN2 has been canceled, reportedly
because of low ratings, high production costs and the fear his ego
would implode with the coming of High Definition Television.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT CHOKES
</P>
<P>
   _Speaking of Ahmad: NBC's ``NBA Inside Stuff'' shows the fallout
of no player participation. On Saturday's show, for example, the
``inside stuff'' is about Lakers trainer Gary Vitti, a gym
dedication to WNBA star Lisa Leslie, pieces on new Sacramento
assistant coach Byron Scott and new Milwaukee head coach George
Karl, plus a retrospective on the career of Washington GM Wes
Unseld.Calm down, kids. Your folks can tape it for you if you miss
it.
</P>
<P>
   _Terry Bradshaw's beard.
</P>
<P>
   _Fox announced it will buy $2 million worth of additional TV
advertising to promote its Fox Sports News cable show. As if this
idea hasn't crossed their minds _ take that cash and bring over
Keith Olbermann.
</P>
<P>
   _ By the way, Fox Sports News has yet to hire a studio analyst
to replace Craig Simpson, who split last summer to become a CBC-TV
analyst in Canada. Cammi Granato, Jim Fox and the Kings' Russ
Courtnall have been substituting so far. Suggestion: Take the
Kings' Ray Ferraro. Please. The 34-year-old has done it before on
ESPN and has been fighting off injuries the past few seasons. And
it would give the team a break by not having someone take penalties
in key situations.
</P>
<P>
   _NBC, the edgiest sports network on TV, has come up with an
unusual concept to air this summer called the ``Gravity Games,''
featuring 11 ``adrenaline-based'' sports including biking, inline
skating, street luge, wakeboarding ... hey, if you're thinking this
is just a knockoff of ESPN's wildly successful ``X-Games,'' well,
you're WRONG. ``We're always looking for exciting new programming
concepts,'' said NBC Sports chief Dick Ebersol, who apparently
doesn't have cable.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He was not on the ballot, but Tuesday's election
was a referendum of sorts on Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky
Republican who is chairman of the National Republican Senatorial
Committee and a staunch foe of revising the campaign finance laws.
The results were decidedly mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Bad news for McConnell came from Wisconsin, where Russell
Feingold, a Democrat, was re-elected. Feingold has been crusading
to pass legislation to overhaul the campaign finance system, and he
made the effort a central issue in his race against Rep. Mark
Neumann. McConnell not only was the leader of efforts to kill the
campaign finance bill this year, his committee had poured nearly $1
million into Wisconsin television commercials attacking Feingold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm coming your way Senator McConnell,'' Feingold declared on
Tuesday at his re-election victory party in Middleton, Wis., vowing
to redouble his efforts to change the way elections are financed.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell had hoped to expand the Republican majority and had
fattened the coffers of his committee with more than $75 million,
compared with $52 million raised by the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee for the 1998 elections. Yet the impressive pile
of cash did not bring any gains in the Republicans' 55-to-45 seat
Senate majority. And the two Republican senators who lost, Alfonse
D'Amato of New York and Lauch Faircloth of North Carolina, were
ousted by Democrats who championed campaign financing changes.
</P>
<P>
   On the bright side for McConnell, his Kentucky colleague,
Representative Jim Bunning, beat Rep. Scotty Baesler, a Democrat
who also backed campaign finance change, in a race to replace
retiring Sen. Wendell Ford. That race was uncomfortably close,
despite the millions McConnell spent in his home state.
</P>
<P>
   At a news briefing Thursday with Rep. John Linder of Georgia,
the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee,
McConnell said he did not think the issue was decisive in the
Feingold race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw no survey data from Wisconsin indicating that campaign
finance reform decided that race,'' he said. In that contest and
others, McConnell said he thought Democrats were ``more
motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   But the advocates of campaign finance overhaul disagreed. They
said the Maginot Line the Kentucky Republican has fortified in
Washington against reforming election spending might be cracking
under pressure from the states. Massachusetts and Arizona passed
ballot initiatives intended to drive special interest money out of
election financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mitch McConnell substantially misread the public on this
issue,'' said Ellen Miller, the executive director of Public
Campaign, an organization that advocates public financing of
federal elections. ``Tuesday gave us some concrete evidence that
voters are tired of the status quo when it comes to how we finance
our elections.''
</P>
<P>
   There was also grousing by some Republicans that McConnell had
limited committee financing for the Republican candidate in
Washington, Representative Linda Smith, a champion of changing
campaign financing, in her Senate race against the Democratic
incumbent, Patty Murray, who was re-elected. Even some Democrats,
who were celebrating the election results, questioned whether there
had been a mandate for campaign finance overhaul or a rebuke of
McConnell. Many Democratic candidates were aided by the $10 million
to $12 million that the Democratic senatorial committee spent on
issue advertisements, financed with so-called soft money, the
unrestricted money that can be donated to political parties for
general campaign use. Such money would be banned under Feingold's
bill, co-sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Although all 45 Senate Democrats voted for the campaign finance
bill, not every Democrat is truly eager to see it enacted. ``There
aren't many incumbent Democrats who want to give up their financial
edge,'' a party strategist said. ``The current system works well
for many of them.''

JUDGE IN MICROSOFT CASE TRIES TO CUT THROUGH JARGON AS HE QUESTIONS
WITNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOEL BRINKLEY and STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Exhibiting increasing frustration with the slow
pace of the antitrust trial against Microsoft Corp., and with the
sometimes incomprehensible techno-jargon, the presiding judge
stepped forcefully into the courtroom proceedings Thursday,
repeatedly rebuking Microsoft's lawyer and then asking the witness,
an Apple Computer Co. executive, a long series of questions that
went directly to the heart of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson of U.S. District Court is both
judge and jury in this case, and he has made clear over the course
of the trial that he is not a technophile. He has also shown
impatience with Microsoft's long and often tedious
cross-examination of government witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The witness on the stand this week, Dr. Avadis Tevanian Jr., a
senior vice president of Apple, is the first witness to testify who
is an engineer, not a businessman, and Jackson took the opportunity
to ask for explanations on several key points.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's lawyer, Theodore Edelman, was nearing the end of his
cross-examination of Tevanian Thursday afternoon, when Jackson
stepped in, asking first that Tevanian explain the difference
between bundling software with an operating system and fully
integrating it into the operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The government accuses Microsoft of wielding the monopoly it has
achieved with its Windows operating system to disadvantage its
principal competitor in Internet software by the way in which it
has combined its Internet Explorer Web browser with Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft argues that Internet Explorer is a fully integrated
and inseparable part of the operating system, not simply a
``bundled'' product that can be removed. To take the browser out of
Windows, Microsoft says, would ``break'' Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Apple makes Mac OS, the only major operating system for personal
computers that competes with Windows, and for a while Apple
included its own Web browser, Cyberdog, with Mac OS.
</P>
<P>
   Edelman was trying to demonstrate that Apple, like Microsoft,
saw advantages in combining the browser and operating system, when
the judge interrupted and asked, ``From a technological
perspective, what are the technical advantages of integrating a
browser, as opposed to bundling it?''
</P>
<P>
   Tevanian said Apple had made a study of this question, had tried
integration instead of bundling but had found that it resulted in
``confusion, extra overhead, and there were were easier ways to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge asked, ``You don't think there is a benefit in any
way, and there may even be a detriment?''
</P>
<P>
   Tevanian responded: ``That's right. We have found that we are
able to achieve what customers want by bundling browsers.'' As
Jackson continued his questioning, Tevanian testified that Apple
could remove the browser from Mac OS without harming the operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The questions and answers cut to the heart of Microsoft's key
defense. Tevanian is a government witness, so it was not surprising
that he gave answers that supported the government's case. But he
is also a top executive of the only company other than Microsoft
that makes a commercially viable operating system and thus the only
other company with experience in combining operating systems and
browsers.
</P>
<P>
   Edelman stood by silently as Jackson's questioning capped a day
marked by increasing friction between the lawyer and the court.
Several times during the day Jackson criticized Edelman for asking
``misleading'' questions and ``mischaracterizing'' what Tevanian
was saying on the stand.
</P>
<P>
   Once, when Edelman tried to question Tevanian about a complex
technical document that the witness had never seen, a government
lawyer objected, and Jackson told Edelman, ``I think you'd better
go on to something else.''
</P>
<P>
   As the day ended, Microsoft introduced testimony to rebut one of
Tevanian's allegations, namely that Steven Decker, a senior
executive of the Compaq Computer Corp., had told another Apple
executive that Compaq would not license Apple's popular multimedia
player, Quicktime, because ``that would upset Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Edelman played part of a videotaped deposition in which Decker
said that Compaq had decided not to license Quicktime simply
because Apple wanted to charge too much for it. The subject of
Microsoft never came up in the discussions, Decker said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Tevanian elaborated on his charge that
Microsoft tried to force Apple to stop developing its Quicktime
software for use on Windows computers. He said that Microsoft had
bluntly described this demand as ``knifing the baby.''
</P>
<P>
   This threat, he said, was made in a meeting in August 1997, when
two Apple executives met with two executives from Microsoft.
Tevanian said this was merely the most graphic expression of
Microsoft's efforts to use its market muscle to dominate the
fast-growing market for the multimedia software used to play audio
and video transmitted over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Edelman repeatedly portrayed Apple's allegations of Microsoft's
threats as vastly overstated. To support that, Microsoft introduced
internal Apple e-mail and strategy documents showing that Apple had
hoped to try to get Microsoft to adopt Quicktime as a standard for
Windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The e-mail record shows that Apple wanted Microsoft to adopt
its technology, which is what the government is accusing Microsoft
of doing as an illegal act,'' said Mark Murray, a Microsoft
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   With all three of the government witnesses who have testified so
far, Microsoft has introduced evidence intended to suggest that the
three companies they represented _ the Netscape Communications
Corp., America Online and Apple _ all employed complaints to the
Justice Department's antitrust division as a competitive tactic
against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   To that assertion, Tevanian testified: ``When someone is
threatening to use monopoly power against you, it is a perfectly
reasonable recourse to go to the Department of Justice. Our goal
was to get Microsoft to play fair.''
</P>
<P>
   The conflict between the two companies over multimedia software
continued even after they had reached an agreement in 1997 that
included settlement of a patent dispute, a $150 million investment
in Apple by Microsoft and Apple's adoption of Microsoft's Internet
Explorer as the preferred browser on Macintosh computers.
</P>
<P>
   The subject was still a sore point on Feb. 3, when Steven P.
Jobs, Apple's acting chief executive, e-mailed William H. Gates,
Microsoft's chairman. Even with the improving relationship between
the two companies, Jobs said ``there is one thing that threatens to
be quite divisive'' _ the behavior of Microsoft's multimedia
executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are really going out of their way,'' Jobs wrote, ``to say
that they intend to kill Quicktime, and they are being quite
threatening and rude about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jobs added that he hoped Apple's ``honest and proper effort'' to
make Quicktime competitive did not meet with ``down and dirty
tactics'' from Microsoft.

COYOTES DOWNPLAY SHOWDOWN WITH MOTOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It's the closest thing to playoff hockey the Coyotes
and their fans likely will see until April or May. The game has
virtually been sold out for months. It's so big, it will be aired
on two different television stations, including ESPN, which will
roll out its No. 1 broadcast team of Gary Thorne and Bill Clement.
</P>
<P>
   The Whiteout? Bah! Get ready for the Red Out.
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes vs. the hated Detroit Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight.
</P>
<P>
   America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Faceoff at 6.
</P>
<P>
   This game has been hyped so much, it's almost starting to sound
like one of those classic heavyweight boxing bouts for the
unification of the championship belt. Or worse, the Super Bowl.
Everyone's been yakking it up, gushing about what a showdown it
will be.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, some of the players are a little sick of all the
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you guys care? Just because (expletive) Detroit's
coming to town, all of a sudden you're looking for a big story,''
Coyotes defenseman Gerald Diduck barked. ``It's not the end of the
world or the dawn of a new day or anything like that. It's just a
freakin' hockey game and it happens to be against Detroit.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a little more than that, though. The Red Wings are the
two-time defending Stanley Cup champions. When they come to
Phoenix, a good portion of the crowd usually shows up wearing
Detroit gear.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings also have dispatched the Coyotes from the playoffs
two of the past three seasons. There's a natural rivalry brewing.
And on top of that, tonight's game has some signifigant meaning to
both clubs.
</P>
<P>
   If the Coyotes win, they will improve to 6-2-1 and will climb
four games over the .500 mark for just the second time since
relocating from Winnipeg three years ago. Detroit, meanwhile, is
6-5-0 and trying to avoid losing four straight since October, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great chance to see where we are right now, but at the
same time, it's just another game and we can't get too excited just
because it's Detroit,'' forward Juha Ylonen said. ``I like playing
them. It's usually great hockey. But it's just one game.''
</P>
<P>
   Even goalie Nikolai Khabibulin tried to downplay the hype,
calling it ``just another game, but a game we have to play well to
win.'' And this from a guy who usually says he gets jacked up to
play Detroit more than any other team in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the Coyotes are issuing the standard company line,
however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I kind of enjoy (the hype),'' center Jeremy Roenick
said. ``Peaople are talking about us being a quality hockey team,
one of the tops in the league. They're talking about us versus
Detroit. If we weren't anything special, they wouldn't be talking
about us, so it's got to be flattering.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes Coach Jim Schoenfeld and his staff have had five full
days to get the team ready for the matchup. Phoenix hasn't played
since blanking Los Angeles on Sunday, 3-0, for its third straight
win and because of the delay in the schedule, the team has been
able to specialize a portion of its practices squarely to gameplan
against Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Detroit) is the best team in the world so it's a great
measuring stick for us,'' Schoenfeld said. ``We feel we've had a
good start, but let's see how we are against the Stanley Cup
champs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is, and the guys who are telling you not
to get over-pumped are right, we have to make sure we channel our
emotion in the right direction or we'll end up playing
uncharacteristic hockey and spending eight of the first 20 minutes
in the penalty box.'' &QL;

MISSING SHIP MAY SAIL AGAIN ONLY IN DREAMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've only sailed the Fantome in my dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but what dreams they are.
</P>
<P>
   I've splayed my bare feet on her smooth, teakwood deck, felt the
salt spray in my face, heard the wind sing in her rigging.
</P>
<P>
   I've climbed out onto the widow's nest under the prow to hang
there in the netting, watching her bow slice cleanly through the
blue waters of the southern Caribbean 15 feet below.
</P>
<P>
   I've watched the wind billow the sails on her four masts,
sending her skimming across the waves, and slept in the gentle
rocking of her passage.
</P>
<P>
   But only in my dreams.
</P>
<P>
   And now she may be lost forever.
</P>
<P>
   In the immense tragedy of human suffering and destruction
wrought by Hurricane Mitch on Honduras, Nicaragua and surrounding
islands, the story of the missing ship Fantome, prized jewel of the
fleet of Windjammer Barefoot Cruises, has been mostly reduced to a
few lines in the newspaper each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Search continues for missing tourist ship. Empty rafts and
life jackets found. No sign of the 31 crew members who were aboard
when she sailed out of Belize, trying to outrun the storm.''
</P>
<P>
   No sign.
</P>
<P>
   The words are almost more than I can swallow, too painful to
comprehend.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a 'Jammer. It's as simple as that.
</P>
<P>
   We _ my wife and I and six other friends _ discovered the
wonderful secret of Windjammer cruising two summers ago. We sailed
the Flying Cloud out of Tortola and through the British Virgin
Islands and we were hooked, like the barracuda the crew members
occasionally caught off the stern of the ship.
</P>
<P>
   Last June it was the Polynesia and a week in the French West
Indies, shopping and diving and dancing at Le Select, where Jimmy
Buffet wrote his famous ``Cheeseburger in Paradise'' on St. Bart's.
I thought I'd gotten too old to have that much fun.
</P>
<P>
   There's something magical about sailing the tall ships,
something that stirs the blood and makes a person as dizzy as the
potent, icy rum swizzles the stewards ladle out by the bucketful
every afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   These ships are the true greyhounds of the sea. Swift. Silent.
Aristocratic.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, as the sails are raised, the ship's speakers come
alive with the sound of bagpipes playing ``Amazing Grace.'' It is
the fleet's theme song and each of the tall ships plays it
faithfully before a sail.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the deck of a big sailing ship, watching the canvas
go up, maybe even pulling on a rope, having that music engulf and
fill you, is one of the most moving experiences of my life. They
will play that song, complete with bagpipes, at my funeral, when I
make my final sail.
</P>
<P>
   The Fantome, we'd all decided, would be our next ship. We'd sail
out of Belize and dive the famed Blue Hole, then on to Lighthouse
Reef, Puerto Cortes and Roatan.
</P>
<P>
   The Fantome is _ I won't say was, not yet _ the flagship of the
Windjammer fleet, built in 1927 for the Duke of Westminster. At 282
feet and easily able to accommodate 120 passengers, she is among
the largest four-masted schooners in the world. She was built for
kings.
</P>
<P>
   She has been owned, at various times, by the Guinness Brewing
family and by Aristotle Onassis, who bought her as a wedding gift
for Princess Grace and Prince Rainier. When he wasn't invited to
the wedding, the gift was never delivered.
</P>
<P>
   She joined the Windjammer fleet as its flagship in 1969 and
underwent a $6 million refurbishment.
</P>
<P>
   And now, heartbreakingly, she and her crew may be gone.
</P>
<P>
   Aboard the Polynesia in late June, just on the cusp of the
hurricane season,
we had asked a steward what actions the ship took in the event of a
big storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We drop the passengers and female crew members at the nearest
island with a hotel,'' we were told, ``and then we try to outrun
the wind.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like a chilling strategy, but there's little else that
a ship that size can do. There's no anchor that would hold it in
gale force winds, no pier to tie up to that wouldn't batter it to
pieces. Its only option is to hoist sail and run.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Fantome did on Oct. 27, a week ago Tuesday.
Passengers were put ashore in Belize and arrangements were made as
quickly as possible to get them home. The ship sailed out again
immediately, trying to find some open sea. When last heard from by
satellite phone, 10 days ago, the ship was reporting 100-knot winds
and was listing more than 40 degrees from gigantic waves, somewhere
southwest of the island of Roatan.
</P>
<P>
   Then the phone line went dead. The ship has not been heard from
or seen since. Three Coast Guard planes continue to search an area
the size of Colorado. The British Navy vessel HMS Sheffield
recovered two empty life rafts, half a dozen life jackets and other
debris it believes came from the Fantome. The 31 crew members
aboard have vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Searchers are becoming more and more convinced that the ship is
now at the bottom of the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Since crew members sometimes move from ship to ship, there may
have been someone on board who sailed with us on the Flying Cloud
or Polynesia. Windjammer Barefoot Cruises, still holding out hope,
won't release a crew manifest unless the worst case scenario is
realized or they are rescued.
</P>
<P>
   Lord knows, we need a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   I keep thinking of the crew, courageously trying to save that
beautiful ship by taking her out into the open ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Running from the wind.
</P>
<P>
   This time, she may not have been able to run fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   The only way we may ever sail her now, is in our dreams.

   POSOLTEGA, Nicaragua _ Where just a week ago there were fertile
fields of corn, beans and peanuts almost ready for harvest, there
are now only discolored corpses, swelling grotesquely in the
tropical sun. Where the simple thatched houses of peasants have
always stood, all that remains are clusters of ripped and shredded
clothing and a few scattered kitchen utensils.
</P>
<P>
   For Central America, the storm that raged off the coast for days
and the floods and landslides that it brought have been a
catastrophe, killing at least 9,000 people and inflicting billions
of dollars of damage. No single place, however, has been harder hit
than this collection of humble agricultural settlements near the
Nicaragua-Honduras border where at least 1,500 people, and perhaps
many more, perished after a series of landslides swept down upon
them over a four-day period ending Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a tragedy beyond measure, beyond our
comprehension,'' said Juan Alberto Munoz Gomez, a
36-year-old-farmer from one of the half-dozen villages that was
obliterated by the stream of mud. ``I thought we were all going to
die, and perhaps it would have been better if we had, for now we
have nothing, not our loved ones, not our houses, not our crops,
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the hurricane, it had been raining incessantly for
nearly a week here, forcing residents of the villages on the flanks
of the Casita Volcano to remain in their houses instead of going
out to investigate conditions. So when the first of the murderous
mudslides announced itself as a loud rumble just before noon Oct.
30, nearly everyone was taken by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, it sounded like a brigade of helicopters was
landing,'' said Fausto Moreira Ruiz, 63. ``But then the noise got
impossibly louder, the ground began to shake, and then, before we
knew it, the mud was on top of us.'' When it was over, he and his
daughter Ofelia, 31, were the only survivors of a family of nine.
</P>
<P>
   When Ana Francisca Sandoval Hernandez and her family heard the
sounds, they ran out to the local baseball field to get a better
view. It was there that they saw a wall of dirt mixed with trees,
rocks and roofs of houses, more than 20 feet high, heading towards
them, with a herd of frantic oxen running in front of the advancing
avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was the end of the world,'' Miss Sandoval, 22,
said from the hospital bed in nearby Chinandega where she is being
treated for injuries caused by the stones, sand and branches that
raked and scraped her body as she was dragged along by the mud flow
for nearly two hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst part now, especially at night or when there's a lot
of fog, is the fear that it is going to happen again,'' said
Ernesto Juarez, a farm worker in the settlement of Calle Real del
Bosque. ``All it takes is just a bit of rumbling, and people rush
out of their houses and begin running around every which way.''
</P>
<P>
   From the air, it looks as if a giant hand had descended from the
top of the volcano, its coffee-colored fingers clawing and gouging
their way indiscriminately across fields, streams, settlements and
highways.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those caught in the avalanche were buried alive as they
tried to outrun the mudflow, and will remain interred in unmarked
graves, but others were merely immobilized, trapped up to their
waists or shoulders and left to worry that the next wave would bury
them too.

POSOLTEGA, Nicaragua: them too.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``All night long, I could hear people yelling for help,'' said
Miguel Angel Cama Valdivia, 28, a farmworker from El Porvenir who
said he ran for three miles before the mud overtook him. ``And I
was crying out, too. I might still be there if a boy hadn't come
along and pulled me out of the mud.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelvin Madariaga Gonzalez, 11, survived the onslaught only by
taking refuge on an oxcart that had wound up lodged on top of a
tree. The boy, severely bruised, was eventually evacuated to a
hospital where he was reunited with an older brother, Humberto, 20,
but Kelvin still does not know what happened to his parents and
8-year-old twin brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are all in the other hospital,'' he said
hesitantly. ``That is what my brother told me.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the magnitude of personal loss the survivors have
suffered is so overwhelming as to stagger the imagination.
Francisco Javier Sandoval, for instance, counts 47 relatives who
were swept away and still have not been accounted for: ``uncles and
aunts, brothers, cousins, nephews and nieces, family members of all
sizes and ages,'' he said with anguish in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   Others are still struggling to accept what has happened. ``I
went up there again today looking for my wife, my children, my
brothers, my mother-in-law, and my brothers-in-law,'' said Felix
Pedro Caballero, a 26-year-old farmer. ``But I didn't find them.
All I found was a pair of pants belonging to my brother. But I'm
going to keep going back until I find them, dead or alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Relief workers say the odds are that Caballero's search, like
that of thousands of others whose relatives are still missing, will
never be satisfied. With so many decaying corpses strewn about the
landscape, health workers have abandoned hope of identifying and
burying the dead, and are now merely collecting bodies and burning
them en masse.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, peasants in remote areas are simply gathering
bodies and burying them in common graves without bothering to
report their actions to the authorities. ``My sons alone have
buried 40 or 50,'' said Maria Lourdes Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Another round of heavy rains Wednesday night only made the
situation worse. The downpour swept dozens of corpses down the
mountainside and into gullies, adding to the threat of epidemics by
contaminating drinking water, and making it easier for ravenous
pigs and dogs to feast on the flesh.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, the decomposing, grayish-yellow bodies of a
half-dozen victims still lay in a sugarcane field just north of
Calle Real del Bosque. Some were adults, others were children; all
had been stripped of their clothing and any possible identifying
documents by the tremendous force of the mudslides, and most lay on
their backs, their mouths open and their arms stiffly extended as
if they had been swimming
</P>
<P>
   ``It is painful to say this, because we are Nicaraguans, and
these are our countrymen,'' said Jose Perez Aviles, a Ministry of
Health inspector who was leading a team equipped with cans of
diesel gasoline and rubber tires to dispose of the corpses. ``The
dead who are already buried are going to have to be left in place,
and the others are going to have to be incinerated because they are
a risk to the health of survivors.''
</P>
<P>
   By those macabre standards, Isaias Vasquez Santeliz has to be
counted as one of the lucky ones. The 12-year-old boy survived the
mudslide and was hospitalized over the weekend, but could not stave
off infections in the wounds he suffered when he was carried by and
trapped in the mud.
</P>
<P>
   So on Wednesday afternoon, his grandparents, uncles and aunts
wrapped his body in a blue tarpaulin and a white lace tablecloth
and placed him in a simple gray coffin that was hoisted onto a
flatbed truck. As a tractor led a procession to the cemetery here,
relatives and townspeople walked behind or rode on bicycles,
thankful that at least one child could be properly buried.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were six in that family, and now only one remains,
Isaac, the youngest son of my only daughter,'' the boy's
grandmother, Candida Morales Delgado, said tearfully as the casket
was lowered into the ground. ``We will care for him as best we can
because he is all that we have left.''

VAUGHN SWEEPSTAKES BEGIN; SOX NOT ALONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Under a full moon at 12:01 a.m. Friday, Mo Vaughn was
free to take offers from any and all comers.
</P>
<P>
   From southern California to the South Bronx and down to
Maryland's Eastern Shore, cell phones and pocket calculators were
on full alert. The Dodgers, Angels, Orioles, and Yankees are among
the teams believed to have serious interest in Vaughn, who has
attracted ``enthusiasm that is obvious,'' according to one source
familiar with the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   On Yawkey Way, meanwhile, the Red Sox, though no longer enjoying
the exclusive privilege of talking dollars with Vaughn, are
expected very shortly to make another overture to the player's
agents, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
   They have yet to produce an offer to the first baseman as CEO
John Harrington has said in print and TV interviews that they would
like to see what the market price will be first.
</P>
<P>
   But in some respects, the Red Sox set the market when they gave
pitcher Pedro Martinez a six-year deal worth an average of $12.5
million annually a year before he was eligible to become a free
agent. While Harrington has called Mike Piazza's seven-year, $91
million deal with the Mets the market ``standard,'' the catcher's
contract barely gave an upward nudge to the bar set by the Sox and
Martinez last winter.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Vaughn ultimately comes in over or under that bar
remains to be determined, of course. His published comments
Thursday that he is seeking a guaranteed five-year contract should
have come as no surprise to the Red Sox; sources familiar with the
negotiations said the Sox have been aware of Vaughn's desire for a
contract of that length for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Club spokesman Kevin Shea labeled reports that Vaughn wanted
five years as ``speculation'' even though the player was quoted.
Shea said the club would have no comment on negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   While the duration of the deal looms as an important factor in
Vaughn's decision, it is merely one component of a total package in
which the other terms will also have to fall into planetary
alignment: the dollars, of course, and no-trade provisions, and
perhaps, as in the case of Martinez, language that would allow
Vaughn to request a trade if the Sox fell short of playoff
contention. Weight clauses could be another issue.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Red Sox expect Vaughn's agents to grant them last
call _ a chance to match or beat any offer _ they're mistaken, one
source said. ``Mo's not coming back to anybody,'' the source said.
``At some point, Mo's going to decide, `This is where I want to
be,' and it will be over. There are teams that could make a short
game of this.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to remain a participant in that game is for the Red
Sox to make. Publicly, they continue to say re-signing Vaughn is
their top priority. And Vaughn and his agents have said publicly
and privately that they will not rule out a return to the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Sox have said they were puzzled that Vaughn's
agents did not make a counteroffer to the four-year, $37.5 million
proposal the club made at the All-Star break, sources say Vaughn's
agents did not bother because that offer fell so far short of what
the 30-year-old veteran is seeking.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Dan Duquette is scheduled to travel to Naples,
Fla., this weekend for the GMs' annual meeting, one at which the
groundwork for future signings and trades will be established. The
Red Sox say they don't want to wait long on Vaughn so they can move
on to other alternatives. The most attractive option is Yankees
center fielder Bernie Williams, the American League batting
champion and Gold Glove winner whose agent, Scott Boras, has said
his client wants a minimum of seven years. White Sox slugger Albert
Belle remains another possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox have said they want to add another front-line
pitcher but do not appear to be among the front-runners for the top
two free agent prizes, Kevin Brown and Randy Johnson. An attractive
alternative could be Texas righthander Todd Stottlemyre, who is
expected to be courted by the Yankees and Orioles as well.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 136 players filed for free agency, including 10
members of the Sox: pitchers Steve Avery, Butch Henry, Dennis
Eckersley, Pete Schourek, and Greg Swindell; infielders Mike
Benjamin, Mark Lemke, Tim Naehring, and Vaughn; and outfielder
Darren Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox have talked to Henry, Eckersley, Swindell, and Naehring
about re-signing, and manager Jimy Williams has said he'd like
Lewis back. Benjamin would also seem to have a good chance of
returning.
</P>
<P>
   Avery's agent, Boras, said four teams have shown interest in the
lefthander, while Schourek has indicated a preference to return to
the National League, according to pitching coach Joe Kerrigan.

STRUGGLE BLAMED ON YOUTH  
 MATURITY SHOULD BRING IMPROVEMENT TO CARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - It's easy to bash the Cardinals. Very easy.
</P>
<P>
   They've made themselves targets for all manner of wise guys by
their failure to produce a winning record during their decade in
the desert.
</P>
<P>
   They've come close. They've had chances. For a multitude of
reasons, few of which correlate with this year's unit that is 4-4
at midseason after an 0-2 start, they haven't climbed over the
hump.
</P>
<P>
   What sets this team apart is its date of birth. It is young.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the three years I've been here, we've had opportunities and
didn't get it done, but I think that steeled our team, strengthened
our resolve,'' Coach Vince Tobin said. ``Again, we have the
opportunity to do something. This could be something that really
matures our team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' closing schedule appears favorable. Five of the
eight games are at home. Among the remaining foes, only Dallas
(5-3) has a winning record. Kansas City and New Orleans are 4-4.
San Diego (3-5), the New York Giants (3-5), Washington (1-7, two
games) and Philadelphia (1-7) are in territory normally associated
with the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a fantastic situation for a mature team. But this is
not a mature team, and that is the root of the inconsistency, the
Cardinals say.
</P>
<P>
   Among 24 key players _ the starters on offense and defense, the
kicker and punter _ 15 came into the season with two or fewer years
of NFL experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an extremely young team, with guys learning on the
run,'' said linebacker Jamir Miller, who, in his fifth season, is
among the old-timers. ``This team has a ton of talent, but we've
paid the price for Cardinals teams past, no question, in the way
we've been criticized. People have to realize this is a different
team. I know they don't want to hear it, but there are reasons why
this team has struggled, and the biggest is youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The faces that were here when I first got here aren't here
anymore. From the time I was drafted, there are only three guys
still here, and I've only been here five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobin, who coached for winning teams at Chicago and
Indianapolis, is aware of the growing pains a young team endures.
He knows how difficult it is to keep young players on top of their
game week to week.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin also understands the magnitude of Sunday's home game
against the Redskins, one that could give his team a winning record
in November for the first time in his tenure. Remember, his last
game with the Colts before becoming the Cardinals head coach was
the AFC Championship game in Pittsburgh, and they came within a
bobbled Hail Mary of a trip to Super Bowl XXX in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is critical,'' Tobin said. ``Any division game is
critical. All the tiebreakers start with division games. It would
be a big step for us to get over that hump. It has been such an
elusive mark for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Inexperienced players think they know, but really don't know,
what it takes to win in the NFL, even if the player was bred in a
winning college program, according to Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say there's not that much difference from college to
pro, but it's huge,'' Miller said. ``Now it becomes a more mental
game. In college, you may face a player with NFL potential three or
four times a year. Now, you're getting one every week. So you have
to be mentally ready every week. It takes time for younger guys to
understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller points to the egg the Cardinals laid two weeks ago when,
at 3-3, they went to New York and were pummeled, 34-7, by the
Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every young team has letdowns,'' Miller said. ``We have not
reached the level of maturity yet where we play every game the best
we possibly can.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no player has been as inconsistent as quarterback Jake
Plummer, who is in his first full season as a starter. He's been
through it before with a maturing team at Arizona State, going from
loser to teaser to a consistent team that was undefeated in the
regular season his senior year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teamwork and unity started to come together at ASU,''
Plummer said. ``You can feel that out here now, too. Everyone gets
along. We're in it together. Although we haven't been doing well on
offense, the defense is still pulling for us. That's the first step
in building a consistent winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Murrell, the Cardinals running back who saw a struggling
New York Jets team mature from a loser to a winner before he was
traded in March, said the speed of the game is an eye-opener to
young players.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get here, and the game now comes so quickly,'' Murrell
said. ``The tempo of the game picks up. That's what we're going
through. Our tempo now has to pick up to match that. If we do that,
we will win our share of games in the second half because we've got
the talent to do what we set out to do. But we're very young.''
</P>
<P>
   And because they are young, it would be a mistake to overhype
the importance of getting past .500 with a win Sunday, Pro Bowl
left tackle Lomas Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing we can't do is put too much emphasis on it,'' Brown
said. ``What we have tended to do when we get to the point where we
have a big game is overemphasize it. That causes you to be tight
and do things you probably wouldn't do because of the magnitude of
the game. Yes, it is a big important game, but it is just another
game, another step toward where we want to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young teams have growing pains. The thing we have to do is
just be patient. . . . I don't know which way we'll go, up or down.
I know fans are frustrated. We are, too, but we're hanging in
there, and all we can do is ask them to hang with us.'' &QL;

PALMER POISED TO THROW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Carson Palmer nervously called his father last
week with one bit of news that varied from their usual
conversations about USC football. The freshman revealed that he
would make his first start at quarterback for the Trojans, then
swore his dad to secrecy, per instructions of the USC coaching
staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was concerned I would tell somebody, or Washington would
find out and the coaches would be upset,'' Bill Palmer recalled.
</P>
<P>
   It just might have been the first time this season that the
18-year-old has shown any emotion. Whether dodging a defensive
player or talking to his teammates in the huddle, it's been nearly
impossible to find an instance where USC's new starting quarterback
wasn't calm and relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first comment anybody made to us, since he was a
quarterback in the ninth grade, was how much poise he had,'' Bill
Palmer said. ``It's old hat to us.''
</P>
<P>
   And to Palmer, being laid-back is as natural as becoming just
the second nonredhirt freshman in USC history to start at the
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't have a bad temper,'' Carson Palmer said. ``I'm
pretty easygoing about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   That personality trait is probably as responsible for Palmer's
success as the golden arm that has captured the hearts of USC fans
since the season opener against Purdue, when he sparked the Trojans
to a 27-17 come-from-behind victory in his college debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings an air of confidence with him,'' wide receiver Mike
Bastianelli said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, USC coach Paul Hackett finally relented and named
Palmer the starter over sophomore Mike Van Raaphorst. Palmer
responded by passing for 279 yards in the Trojans' 33-10 victory
over Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer was his usual deadpan self when analyzing his effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I did well, but I didn't think I did anything
spectacular,'' Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   But in one performance, he effectively ended the quarterback
controversy that enveloped USC for the first eight games of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, Carson gives us the best opportunity to win the
next three games, therefore he'll be the starter,'' Hackett said.
``I wasn't sure whether or not we'd feel comfortable enough with
him being the starter this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had hoped we would. By no means is he an accomplished
quarterback, but his poise and natural ability to handle himself,
his ability to pass, were obvious on Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   There's that word again, ``poise.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a trait he inherited from his father. While discussing
Carson's rapid ascent from near unknown to starter in less than
three months at USC, Bill said, ``It's been exciting, but frankly I
expected it to happen sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Mike is a very good, decent quarterback. But I think
there's a difference between them that stands out.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer's demeanor, however carefree on the surface, should never
be confused with apathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't misread him. He's very competitive. He doesn't like to
lose,'' Bill Palmer said. ``He's always been easygoing. What's
going on inside is probably different.''
</P>
<P>
   It just rarely shows itself.
</P>
<P>
   Around his close friends, his schoolmates from Santa Margarita
High, he is different. Palmer routinely runs up a $200 monthly
phone bill talking to his friends all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talks to his friends constantly,'' Bill said. ``Most of
them see another personality.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, Palmer has not strayed from his usual pose, even
though everyone now knows he is the No.1 quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm completely comfortable,'' he said. ``It really doesn't
seem much different. I know every play this week. I started
studying Monday night.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer's likable nature has also prevented his relationship with
Van Raaphorst from fraying since they have switched roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The night I found out I was starting, I told Mike, `I know
it's hard, but I don't want to mess up what's between us,''' Palmer
said. ``He was like an extra tutor for me. Without Mike _ ever
since he got here he was my workout partner, showing me the plays.
He's helped a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst said his relationship with Palmer has not changed,
but he remains at a loss for explaining how he lost his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look back at my performance and I saw steady improvement,''
Van Raaphorst said. ``I was improving as a quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst doesn't wield much influence over playing time,
however, and is no longer even platooning with Palmer for the final
three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike's job is to support Carson and be ready when the time
comes,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   It might never come. Many are already speculating that Palmer
could be good enough to leave USC after his junior season for the
NFL. But high expectations are nothing new. When he was 13, a
family friend had then-USC coach John Robinson autograph a schedule
poster. It said, ``Dear Carson, We'll see you in the Class of
'98.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer has the poster today, and always had USC in the back of
his mind when it came time to select a school.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a homebody,'' Bill Palmer said. ``He wanted to stay close
to his family.''
</P>
<P>
   There was another reason, according to Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like the reason I came to USC, the reason Carson came to
USC was to be the best in football. Not just to be the starter or
to win games, but to be the best in football. That will take
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing much else has for Palmer.

JAPANESE STOCKS UP ON POSITIVE ANALYSIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The ruling Liberal Democratic Party is reluctantly
discussing a temporary reduction of the nation's 5 percent sales
tax in an effort to win support from the opposition Liberal Party.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Party, headed by a former ruling party member,
Ichiro Ozawa, has made a rollback of the ``consumption tax'' _
essentially, a national sales tax _ part of the price of its
support. The ruling party needs the Liberals if it is to curb the
opposition's ability to hold legislative proceedings ransom to its
demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the price we must pay,'' said a senior party leader,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Party would like to see the tax temporarily reduced
from 5 percent to 1 percent to stimulate consumer spending and lift
Japan's stagnating economy. U.S. officials have urged a permanent
cut in the consumption tax.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the government denies that a tax cut may be in the
offing. Akitaka Saiki, spokesman for Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi,
said Thursday, ``I am not aware of such discussions'' about a
possible rollback.
</P>
<P>
   Other sources in the Liberal Democratic Party confirmed that
talks were under way; cuts in the consumption tax are being
publicly discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be more and more momentum behind the idea of a
temporary cut in the consumption tax,'' said Ron Bevacqua, an
economist at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. in Tokyo, who warns that a
temporary cut would distort consumption patterns and do more harm
than good. ``Even though it makes no sense economically, the
politicians have shown time and again that they are not above this
kind of thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling party lacks a majority in the Upper House of
Parliament and is casting about for ways to secure a better hold on
power before the next parliamentary session, which could start late
this month.
</P>
<P>
   It sees alliances with small opposition parties like the Liberal
Party as the best way of achieving that goal and has been
bargaining hard in recent weeks to curry their favor.
</P>
<P>
   It is discussing a plan to issue gift certificates as a way of
spurring consumer spending and winning the cooperation of Komeito,
another opposition party whose support would give the LDP the
minimum needed for a majority in the Upper House.
</P>
<P>
   And it has been talking with Ozawa, who has been a thorn in the
LDP's side since he left the party in 1993, about expanding credit
guarantees to small firms and a temporary, partial rollback of the
consumption tax, perhaps starting next April.
</P>
<P>
   Although senior members of the Liberal Democratic Party
generally oppose a cut in the tax, that they have gone so far as to
discuss it at all is a measure of the pressure they feel to put
together even a shaky majority. Without it, they say, the party is
uncertain it could survive a sudden no-confidence vote.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kabun Muto, a senior Liberal Democratic Party member from the
conservative wing of the party, has said he would favor a one-year
reduction in the tax, and Hiromi Nonaka, chief cabinet secretary,
has made it clear that he considers ties with the Liberal Party of
paramount importance.
</P>
<P>
   The consumption tax, which was enacted in 1989, is one of the
major achievements of Noboru Takeshita, a former prime minister who
continues to wield considerable power. Takeshita controls the
largest faction in the LDP, and Obuchi is seen as his protege.
</P>
<P>
   An increase in the tax to 5 percent from 3 percent in April
1997, imposed in hopes of reducing a budget deficit, is often
blamed for precipitating a steep decline in consumer spending that
has compounded Japan's economic woes.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. secretary of the treasury, Robert Rubin, even suggested
that the government here consider such a rollback in a private
meeting earlier this year in New York with Kiichi Miyazawa, a
leading party elder who subsequently became finance minister.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that the party will be forced to backtrack on
the tax is the buzz of Nagatacho, the area where most legislators
have their offices. Many party members are worried that the party's
efforts to woo the opposition are going too far, although they
concede the necessity of winning opposition support.
</P>
<P>
   The contemplated rollback, like the proposal to issue gift
certificates, is opposed by the Ministry of Finance, arguing that
once the tax is reduced, it will be hard to reinstate.
</P>
<P>
   And some economists warn that any temporary cut will wreak
economic havoc, first causing sales to stop until the tax cut is
enacted, then causing a year-long spending spree followed by a
sharp contraction when the tax moved back to its current level.
They say a temporary tax cut will have a particularly severe
negative impact on consumption of big-ticket items like cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``As occurred in 1997 with the temporary reduction of the auto
tax in France, spending was postponed from the announcement date
until the tax cut became effective, and then, upon the expiration
of the tax cut, new-car sales fell off the cliff,'' said Jay
Woodworth, an independent automobile analyst.
</P>
<P>
   But Ozawa may be figuring that the political pain of restoring
the tax once it is rolled back might be too much for the LDP to
stomach, in which case he would win immense credit with voters for
master-minding a reduction in a tax that many have hated from the
start.

SCOTTY'S RETURN MAY GET WINGS BACK ON QUACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, ARIZ. - ``Quaaack! Quaaack!''
</P>
<P>
   Was that the mating call of the green-winged teal duck
reverberating around the rink Thursday at the Cellular One Ice Den?
Wait a minute, what would a duck be doing at the Coyotes'
Scottsdale practice facility?
</P>
<P>
   It was none other than Scotty Bowman, the legendary head coach
of the Detroit Wings, chirping out line changes on his legendary
silver-plated duck call whistle.
</P>
<P>
   It was music to the ears of the two-time defending Stanley Cup
champions,
</P>
<P>
   So what if Bowman ran them into the ground during an exhausting,
one-hour, 15-minute practice? So what if the Big Red Machine has
lost three straight games and their coach is understandably a tad
grumpy? So what if he stills carries around that goofy duck call?
</P>
<P>
   Scotty's back, and that's all that matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the same Scotty as before,'' Detroit captain Steve
Yzerman said. ``I don't think he's ever going to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably not. But if Bowman hadn't changed his mind about
retiring this season after a summer of uncertainty and health
concerns, the NHL's all-time winningest coach wouldn't be back
where he belongs, trying to lead the Detroit to its third straight
Stanley Cup championship.
</P>
<P>
   Some things in life are destined to remain the same. Autumn
leaves always change colors. English muffins always get stuck in
the toaster. Scotty Bowman always is behind the bench with one of
hockey's most talented and feared teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I'd do if I didn't have this,'' Bowman
confessed as he sat in one of the Ice Den's remote locker rooms.
``This has been life for so long now. It's what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also who he is.
</P>
<P>
   Now in his 27th season, Bowman has won eight Stanley Cups, tied
for the most in history with former Montreal Canadiens Coach Toe
Blake, his mentor.
</P>
<P>
   Bowman has won a record 1,059 NHL games as a head coach and will
be shooting for 1,060 tonight when Detroit meets the Coyotes at
America West Arena. But much like their coach, who underwent what
amounts to a total knee transplant, the Wings limped into the
Valley having lost three straight.
</P>
<P>
   They haven't lost four in a row since Bowman's first month on
the job in Detroit in October of 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll get things straightened out,'' he said calmly.
</P>
<P>
   Just like he did, personally, by straightening out his health
problems and questions as to whether he should finally retire his
lucky duck call for good.
</P>
<P>
   It started in June, shortly after the Red Wings celebrated their
Stanley Cup championship by sweeping Washington in four straight
games.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Bowman, Scotty's brother and a scout for the Buffalo
Sabres, died of a heart attack at age 59. While in Buffalo less
than two weeks later for the NHL's entry draft, Scotty, 61, looked
as if he had come to the realization he should step down and leave
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, but that was a rough time for me in Buffalo that week,''
he said. ``My brother had just passed away and a lot of things
we're going through my head.''
</P>
<P>
   One of them was to make sure he was healthy enough to continue.
After undergoing a battery of tests and extensive examinations,
doctors recommended he have angioplasty to clear blockage in an
area around his heart. Next, he decided to fix that old and tired
arthritic left knee, something he had been putting off the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
   That surgery, performed on Aug. 19, kept him away from the Red
Wings during all of training camp, the preseason and the club's
first five regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, he thought the recovery process would keep him out
until December. That might have led to a decision to retire, he
revealed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like the format of coming back that late because I
don't think it would have been good for the team,'' he said. ``The
team was doing well and the guys did a hell of a job adjusting, so
did (assistant coaches) Barry (Smith) and Dave (Lewis). But over
time, when you go that long without a head coach . . . it's too
much to ask. Any further delay was not the answer. I was concerned
that if I didn't come back before I did, it wouldn't have helped.''
</P>
<P>
   But he's back and he's still Scotty.
</P>
<P>
   One his first day back behind the bench, he split the team's No.
1 line of Brendan Shanahan, Yzerman and Darren McCarty. He's moved
slumping center Sergei Fedorov everywhere except to defense. He
still keeps everyone on their toes and guessing.
</P>
<P>
   Especially when he talks about his future. Will he leave the
game if he surpasses Blake's record and the Red Wings threepeat as
champs?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about the record,'' Bowman said. ``I'm just
worried about what I would do if I didn't coach. That's something
that's going to happen. There will be a day that comes when I won't
be able to do it. Either I just won't feel like I'm up to it or . .
. it will just depend on the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, you just reach the end of the line with some teams.
It's tough for a veteran coach to go rebuild a team. For a young
coach, on his first bounce-back job, it's easier. A guy like Craig
Hartsburg, for instance, who was in Chicago and is now in Anaheim.
He'll do good. Same with a guy like (former Colorado Avalanche
Coach) Marc Crawford. He'll bounce back and be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? Maybe in a year or two, Crawford will take over for
Bowman in Hockeytown. Without the duck call, of course. &QL;

IN POLITICS, MONEY ISN'T EVERYTHING, BUT IT SURE HELPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., N.C., Ill., N.M., Wis., Minn.)  (Eds: See also ELN-DEMS-BLACKS, ELN-DEMS-SOUTH, ELN-MCCONNELL,

 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even though the Republican Party outspent the
Democrats by $110 million in the midterm elections, the strong
Democratic rebound illustrates the point that money isn't
everything.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans poured $25 million into a much-publicized
television campaign on behalf of House candidates, but only 19 of
them won, while 38 lost. And some of the most expensive campaigns
in the country ended in defeat: Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., spent
$18.7 million; Sen. Lauch Faircloth, R-N.C., spent $8.3 million;
and Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun, D-Ill., spent $7.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   For most candidates, however, money did make a difference. In 94
percent of Senate races and 95 percent of House races, the
candidate who spent the most money won. Only rarely did a financial
longshot win a congressional seat. Rep. Heather Wilson, R-N.M., for
instance, spent only a quarter of the $2.7 million spent by
Democrat Philip Maloof and she still won.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, victory has increasingly gone to the
richest candidate. In 1992, 89 percent of the House candidates with
the most money won, as did 86 percent of the richest Senate
candidates. By 1994, this grew to 88 percent for the House and 86
percent for the Senate. It increased again in 1996, when those
candidates with the most money won 92 percent of House races and
and 88 percent of Senate races.
</P>
<P>
   When the final accounting is done, the 1998 midterm elections
will continue to raise the financial bar and break fund-raising
records. More than $1 billion was spent to elect a House and a
Senate that changed only slightly. A total of $387.3 million was
raised by the 775 people running for the House, and $243.2 million
was raised by the 68 Senate candidates. On top of this was the
money raised by the parties: $284.6 million by Republican
committees and $173.8 million by Democratic committees.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, incumbents raised more money than challengers
by a disproportionate margin _ and won. In more than 60 House
districts, for instance, incumbents had a 10-1 cash advantage. More
incumbents were re-elected _ 98 percent _ than at any time in the
past decade, one of the highest rates in this century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money doesn't guarantee winning, but it sure gives you a big
advantage,'' said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a
nonprofit group favoring campaign finance reform. ``Almost all the
congressional candidates who won had substantially more money then
their opponents _ and almost all those folks were incumbents. It
was as lopsided as I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The financial mismatch was most pronounced in House races. The
average House incumbent raised $733,731, compared with $184,357 for
the average challenger, according to an analysis of Federal
Election Commission data by Common Cause, the nonprofit lobbying
group.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, incumbents raised a total of $156.7 million
compared with the $64.6 million raised by challengers. Moreover,
political action committee donations went overwhelmingly to Senate
incumbents, $37.1 million, while challengers got only $3.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The big difference in spending by the two parties came in the
use of soft money, the unrestricted donations that campaign finance
watchdogs want to cut off. Much of the soft money flowed into
battleground states _ California, New York and Kentucky for the
Democrats and Nevada, New York and Michigan for the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Democrats, with less cash, spent their money primarily
on cheaper get-out-the-vote efforts, while the Republicans financed
a more costly attack advertising campaign that, in many races,
backfired.
</P>
<P>
   Money was one of the reasons cited for the strong showing by
Democrat Charles Schumer in the New York Senate race, the most
expensive in the country. A $12 million war chest, collected over
his many years as U.S. representative, was large enough to take on
D'Amato, a fund-raiser of legendary proportions. D'Amato raised $25
million, more than any other congressional candidate, and spent
$18.7 million. By law, he can use what is left over to fund other
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Even though national Republican committees paid for an expensive
television campaign on behalf of Wisconsin Senate challenger Mark
Neumann, he lost to Democratic incumbent Russell Feingold, who lead
the fight for campaign finance changes and refused to allow
Democratic soft money to be spent on issue advertising on his
behalf. Still, both candidates waged expensive campaigns: Feingold
raised $4.4 million by Sept. 30 to Neumann's $3.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't discount the value of money, but it has to be spent in
a skillful way,'' said Larry Makinson, executive director of the
Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit research group. ``You
have to run a good campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, there were the upsets that challenge
traditional rules about money. Reform Party candidate Jesse
Ventura, a former professional wrestler and radio shock jock, spent
only $250,000 to win the Minnesota governor's race. His Democratic
and a Republican rivals spent a combined $4.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   With so much money raised, campaign finance watchdogs worry
about the impact of these donations on the 106th Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at who spent the most money in these races and
where it came from,'' said Ann McBride, president of Common Cause,
``you see that it has come from tobacco, and labor and gambling and
other interests. The people who have received it are now beholden
to those interests. The money has been raised in a way that it will
have real influence in the upcoming Congress.''

HEALTHY WOODSON MORE AGGRESSIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Darren Woodson stretches his muscular right arm
to emphasize how much it hurts. Fact is, many of us would be unable
to even slam a car door or push a grocery cart if faced with the
pain that Woodson has faced.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the Cowboys have asked their star strong safety to extend
his surgically repaired limb to defend speedy receivers and tackle
bullheaded fullbacks. Until recently, Woodson admits he has not
made the plays like the three-time All-Pro that he has become.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Cowboys prepare to play the New York Giants on
Sunday, Woodson said he's as healthy as he has been all season. The
effects from off-season shoulder and biceps surgery still linger,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But a healthy Woodson covering tight ends and wide receivers
across the middle can only help the Cowboys' defense cut down on
big plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't played that well. My arm definitely affected that
early, and for the first five, six games I just didn't feel
right,'' said Woodson, who tore a biceps muscle in March while
rehabilitating his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the coaches were concerned about it a bit. But now, I'm
feeling a lot more comfortable, mentally and physically. I told
them I'm ready to go. It's still a little sore when I stick my arm
out. But I really feel like I'm coming on. I really feel like I'm
ready to play like I'm capable of playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his aches and pains, Woodson still has been sturdy
enough to record 66 tackles, second on the team. Where his arm
problem showed up most was in defending against passes.
</P>
<P>
   As he struggled to manage the pain that accompanied bump-and-run
coverage, Woodson allowed Denver's Shannon Sharpe and Oakland's
Raghib ``Rocket'' Ismail to run free for touchdown receptions. He
knocked down just two passes. He had no interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Because much of the attention on the Cowboys' shaky pass defense
(six of the first eight passing touchdowns the club had yielded
were of distances longer than 23 yards) had been focused on
cornerback Kevin Smith, Woodson was able to come and go quietly
from Valley Ranch without much fanfare. But being a competitive man
of pride, he didn't need to be reminded of his shortcomings. ``I
hate not being able to play like I'm capable of,'' he said. All he
could do was continue to play his best and wait for his arm to
heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with Darren playing three quarters speed, that is a lot
better than most guys playing full speed,'' defensive coordinator
Dave Campo said. ``So there was never a big question as to how he
was playing. But he wasn't as aggressive as he had been in trying
to get to the ball and doing some of the things he's done in the
past. I knew eventually, though, that if he didn't have those
problems with his shoulder that he'd come around.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodson said he started feeling better in the middle of October.
And it has showed in his past two games, when he has not allowed a
receiver to catch a touchdown pass and has three pass deflections.
He recorded his first interception since Sept. 28, 1997, with a
diving stab of an errant Bobby Hoying pass against the Eagles
Monday night. He had another interception against the Eagles called
back because of a penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking like this could be the start of something,''
Woodson said. ``It has been a long time since I had an
interception. But I feel like once you get one, you get on a roll
and they just start coming your way. ''
</P>
<P>
   Now confident in his abilities, Woodson has reassumed his
customary leadership role in the secondary. Campo said Woodson has
been more assertive in tutoring the younger safeties on the team,
such as Omar Stoutmire and Kenny Wheaton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's starting to take control out there,'' Campo said. ``When
you are trying to take care of yourself, and not playing as well as
you need to be, you tend to not worry about what the other guys are
doing. That's not a leader. And Darren is a leader. The better he
feels about himself, the better leader he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really playing well now.''

SUN DEVILS HOPE KICKING BECOMES SNAP FOR BAKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - ``Snap, kick''.
</P>
<P>
   Got it? ``Snap, kick. Snap, kick. Snap, kick. Snap, kick''.
</P>
<P>
   The Kicker's Mantra drums through Stephen Baker's head each time
he steps on the football field. When he's punting, the incantation
has served him well. As a field-goal kicker, ``snap . . . please,
please, please'' might be more appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Baker's first season has been a wild ride. The Arizona State
redshirt freshman is the nation's second-ranked punter (46.1 yards)
after a brief stint at No. 1. But as a place-kicker, he has
struggled, hitting 5 of 11 field goals. He missed a 41-yarder with
one second remaining against Stanford on Oct. 22, but the Sun
Devils came back to win in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never missed a game-winner before,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the real world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he really knew what it was going to be like,''
said his older brother, Jon Baker. ``High school hints at it, but
this is a whole different atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Baker knows. He was one of the better kickers to land at
ASU. He made 18 field goals in 1993; six times in his two-year
career, he nailed three in a game.
</P>
<P>
   But even he had rough spots. He missed a 47-yard try with 23
seconds remaining in the 28-27 loss to Arizona in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Fabulous Baker Boys talk on the phone several times a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows what it's like to miss, and he knows what it's like
to have a bad game,'' Stephen said. ``He tells me, `You've just got
to shake it off. Worry about next week. Just concentrate on your
job.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Although Jon kicked barefoot, Stephen always felt he had big
shoes to fill.
</P>
<P>
   At Foothill High School in Bakersfield, Calif., Jon set all the
records, and Stephen wiped them out. Stephen's 55-yarder still
stands as the school's longest. Ninety-two percent of his kickoffs
went into the end zone, and he averaged 43.1 yards on punts.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jon never punted, he had been around punters long
enough to begin grooming Stephen when he was young.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jon was always out there helping him with his punting
technique,'' said their father, William Baker. ``It's made a real
difference for Stephen today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils knew Baker had a strong leg but they never
dreamed his punting would be so effective his first season. His
46.1 average is second-best in Pac-10 history.
</P>
<P>
   Baker won the punting job before the season, and redshirt
freshman Mike Gauthier was awarded field-goal kicking
responsibilities. When Gauthier struggled early, Baker took over.
</P>
<P>
   He is 2 of 2 from 20 to 29 yards but 3 of 7 from 40 to 49. His
longest is 48 yards. Gauthier continues to kick extra points and is
22 for 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``ASU is in a tough position,'' Jon Baker said. ``They have two
kids that obviously have a lot of talent, but neither is in a
groove. And that's kind of what it is when you're young. It's about
getting on a roll.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to work harder to try and get better because it's
just not there yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I think it's psychological. And it's still a little
bit of technique. It always is when you miss. I think I kind of
psyched myself out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker's saving grace has been talks with his brother. The two
were always close, but usually in a competitive way. Jon was the
Pac-10's long jump champion, and both are scratch golfers.
</P>
<P>
   Now Jon is more of a mentor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think their relationship has evolved,'' William Baker said.
``Jon's really there for him and they talk a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember one time when Jon was little, we were watching a
football game and I told Jon, `Maybe one day you'll be good enough
to play on TV.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I never dreamed they'd go as far as they have with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping up he family tradition is their younger brother, Ryan, a
redshirt kicker at Bakersfield College.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Baker, meanwhile, continues to pursue the dream.
</P>
<P>
   He signed a free-agent contract with the Dallas Cowboys in 1995
and handled kickoffs in their first three games. He was cut to make
room for Deion Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the next two training camps with San Francisco but was
slowed because of injuries. He played with Scotland of the World
League this past season and made 6 of 7 field goals. He is still in
the pool of kickers that NFL teams turn to, but hasn't secured a
job yet.
</P>
<P>
   His brother hopes to feel more secure with his kicking job soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a pretty emotional kid, and when I say kid, I mean that
affectionately,'' ASU Coach Bruce Snyder said. ``We're just trying
to help him establish his rhythm and build some confidence. He's
getting there.'' &QL;

CLINTON PRESSED FOR CURBS ON STEEL IMPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton came face-to-face Thursday with
the political costs of the world economic crisis, meeting with
steel executives and union leaders who are demanding that
Washington cut off the import of extremely low-cost steel _ much of
it from Brazil, Russia and Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Steel imports in the United States have surged by more than 75
percent in recent months, and the United Steelworkers of America, a
union the White House cannot afford to antagonize after it helped
mobilize Democratic votes on Tuesday, has been insisting for months
that the administration take action.
</P>
<P>
   After their recent comeback, almost all of the country's major
steelmakers now are cutting production and some have begun layoffs,
as prices for steel decline to some of the lowest levels in six
years.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton, as one of his economic aides said the other day,
has ``no good options.'' Any move to limit the flow of low-cost
steel here runs the risk of undercutting the recovery of some of
the nations that are hardest hit by the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it would increase costs for automakers, construction
firms and other manufacturers _ potentially making their goods less
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   So in lengthy meetings and dinners with Commerce Secretary
William Daley and Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, among others,
the steel union officials and top executives _ who rarely find
themselves on the same side of a bargaining table _ have been
engaged in a detailed debate over Clinton's choices.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely option is that the president would pressure
countries to reduce steel exports to the United States, a step
Japanese officials say they are already taking. In the meeting at
the White House Thursday evening, Clinton indicated that he would
take up the issue later this month during his trip through Asia
that includes visits to Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the United States could raise tariffs on imported
steel. But it can only impose those ``anti-dumping duties'' if the
United States International Trade Commission finds that the
imported steel is being sold here at unfairly low prices, causing
injury to American firms.
</P>
<P>
   Such duties were recently imposed on stainless steel coil plate
imported from Taiwan South Africa, Italy, Canada and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   But in the broader complaint filed by the steel industry, the
case may not be clear cut. Foreign officials insist that some of
the price cuts did not result from ``dumping,'' but were created by
the sharp devaluation of Asian and Russian currencies. That
exchange rate advantage makes all goods imported from those
countries less expensive in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the surge in exports from the hardest-hit countries is
exactly what the International Monetary Fund has tacitly been
seeking as a way to boost foreign reserves and rescue faltering
economies. Export increases are factored into the IMF's recovery
plans for several nations, especially Thailand, Korea and
Indonesia. And the United States Treasury approved those
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton acknowledged the problem at an earlier meeting with
steel officials last month, noting that ``the yen got too week, and
it led, for example, to the breathtaking imports of Japanese steel,
which hurt a lot of our industry, people and workers.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's aides point out that after further study they
determined that the problem was immensely complicated _ and that
every proposed solution carried a significant cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take measures to protect the steel industry it hurts
the auto industry,'' one White House official noted recently.
``Eventually, that hurts sales and other workers.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry argues that the damage is already starting. Weirton
Steel, the seventh largest steelmaker, announced recently it was
laying off 300 workers, or nearly 9 percent of its hourly workers,
and it says it may have to dismiss more workers.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Clinton administration needs the steel
workers. Vice President Al Gore has been wooing the industry's
leaders, who are suspicious of the administration's free-trade
leanings, and opposed the effort to expand the president's right to
negotiate trade agreements that can be approved or turned down by
Congress _ but not amended. The divisive arguments over that
authority, called ``fast track,'' are likely to be revived next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides are also worried about a revival of trade
tensions around the world as the American trade deficit mounts each
month.
</P>
<P>
   Charlene Barshefsky, the United States Trade Representative, has
warned that the current account deficit _ the broadest measure of
trade flows _ could hit $300 billion. Daley has warned of ``a major
political backlash that is brewing'' if the flood of imports begins
to cost American jobs.

NEXT BOUT FOR TYSON UP IN AIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Mike Tyson's first two days of an extended training
camp at Phoenix's Madison Square Garden included speculation and no
sparring.
</P>
<P>
   The sparring is expected to begin next week, according to
Madison Square Garden's Ricky Ricardo, who said Tyson hit bags,
shadow-boxed and did conditioning work Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The speculation never ceased.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, there still was no confirmation of either the
reported date, Jan. 16, or the reported opponent, Frans Botha, for
Tyson's first bout since he bit both of Evander Holyfield's ears on
June 28, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   However, there was confirmation that Dan Goossen of the
Denver-based America Presents is Tyson's new promoter. Goossen said
he has a contract with Tyson advisor Shelly Finkel and the Showtime
cable television network, which holds broadcast rights to the
former heavyweight champ.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll work with Mike, Shelly Finkel and Showtime to present
the man we think is the most interesting and biggest attraction in
the sport,'' Goossen said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Goossen declined to talk about either the date or the
opponent for Tyson's comeback, probably at Las Vegas' MGM Grand.
</P>
<P>
   Botha continued to be mentioned as the leading possibility.
</P>
<P>
   However, three other names, Vaughn Bean of Chicago, Brian
Nielsen of Denmark and Axel Schulz of Germany, also have been
mentioned as possibilities if there is no progress in negotiations
with Botha, who is promoted by Frank Warren of London and managed
by Sterling McPherson of Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   McPherson was in the Valley on Monday for a fight card at
Veterans Memorial Coliseum. He said there is no agreement for a
fight with Tyson, who plans to train for 10 weeks at the central
Phoenix gym. &QL;

BRITISH CUT INTEREST RATE BY UNEXPECTEDLY HIGH HALF-POINT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ After a slew of European interest-rate reductions, the
Bank of England ordered a larger-than-expected cut in a key rate
Thursday, half a percentage point, to 6.75 percent. It was the
second reduction in a month, reflecting heightened anxiety over
slower economic growth both in Britain and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two months before the introduction of a single
European currency, though, Germany's central bank resisted strong
political pressure from the new finance minister, Oskar Lafontaine,
to cut rates and said they would remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Financial markets here showed little enthusiasm for the Bank of
England's decision, with the London Stock Exchange declining 2.5
percent. Investors were apparently worried that the unexpectedly
large cut showed that the central bank was more worried about the
economy than it had let on.
</P>
<P>
   Traders also thought that the half-percentage-point cut in the
repurchase rate, an important short-term lending gauge, contrasting
with the bank's more usual quarter-point increments, meant there
was little likelihood of further cuts soon.
</P>
<P>
   But British business, which has blamed high interest rates and a
strong pound for a deep slump in manufacturing and exports,
generally pressed for further cuts. ``With further reductions in
interest rates and in sterling, businesses can get back to the job
of competing and investing for growth,'' said Ian Peters, deputy
director general of the British Chambers of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Britain is not among the 11 countries adopting the new currency,
the euro, in electronic trading on Jan. 1, and is in the throes of
debate over its chances of avoiding recession next year. Two days
ago, Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer, cut his
estimates of growth next year to a range of 1 percent to 1.5
percent. And government figures on Thursday showed a
bigger-than-forecast four-tenths of a percent drop in manufacturing
output in September.
</P>
<P>
   Other European nations face a more complex array of
interest-rate pressures. Those that will adopt the euro are
supposed to harmonize key interest rates at 3.3 percent, in line
with France and Germany. Spain and Portugal lowered key rates by a
quarter of a percentage point this week to move closer to that
target.
</P>
<P>
   The German central bank, by contrast, argues that its rates are
already low and that any further reduction would make it harder for
other nations to bring their rates down before the euro is
introduced and the European Central Bank assumes responsibility for
monetary policy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In addition, the Bundesbank is locked in a battle of wills with
Lafontaine, the left-leaning finance minister, who has been
exerting political pressure for lower rates to spur growth and
combat Germany's stubbornly high joblessness.
</P>
<P>
   Figures announced Thursday showed German unemployment slightly
lower _ down 43,000, to 4.106 million, on a seasonally adjusted
basis in October. There was, though, a widespread perception that
this could be attributed to job-creation measures before last
month's national elections rather than any upturn in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Lafontaine attended Thursday's meeting of the Bundesbank council
in Frankfurt, and his ministry said later that European interest
rates had been ``a particular emphasis of the discussion'' _
suggesting strong resistance by the central bank to his demands for
lower rates. A Finance Ministry statement insisted, however, that
``no member of the government is questioning the independence of
the Bundesbank or the European Central Bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweden and Denmark, both outside the euro zone, also cut rates
earlier this week, and Denmark cut its benchmark rate another
quarter-point Thursday, to 4.40 percent from 4.65 percent. The
Danes were retreating from a rate increase in September intended to
protect their currency from world financial upheaval, said Jose
Luis Alzola, an economist with Salomon Smith Barney. The cut in
Sweden, he said, was inspired by ``a gloomier assessment of
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a common theme across Europe,'' Alzola added.
``Expectations for growth are being revised downward.''

IT'S A NO-BRAINER: STANFORD IS TERRIFIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Forget Jim Plunkett and John Elway and Mike
Mussina and all those swimmers. Sit down, you Nobel laureates.
Economists, physicists, pillars of society, paragons of brilliance,
thanks for all your good work. Now leave. Chelsea who? Who cares?
This is what really matters right now:
</P>
<P>
   Stanford's got game.
</P>
<P>
   It's hoops heaven down on The Farm, where the men have finally
caught up with the women, where the most skilled medical minds on
campus can't cure basketball fever, where brains plus brawn equals
a Cardinal team good enough to share that rarified air with the
sport's usual suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Like, say, Duke, coincidentally another bastion of academic
excellence. Stanford and Duke are within a brain wave of each other
in the polls, which raises the specter of the Final Four in St.
Petersburg, Fla., resembling a Mensa convention. But regardless of
whether the Cardinal gets there, this season represents unexplored
territory in terms of interest and expectations.
</P>
<P>
   For example, students started camping out for the first
practice, a k a Midnight Madness, a k a Cardinal Chaos, two weeks
beforehand to ensure getting in, which would thus ensure them
getting season tickets. About 60 tents went up before the
administration came up with a lottery system to preclude the poor
babies from being exposed to the elements. For the first time,
Maples Pavilion, capacity 7,391, is sold out for every game.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of all the ruckus is Coach Mike Montgomery, who,
accordingly, was the featured attraction at Pac-10 Media Day on
Thursday. Montgomery brought pizzas to the campers in a manner
similar to Mike Krzyzewski at Duke, where tents are the preferred
form of housing among student fans. Montgomery seems slightly
bemused by all the attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said, ``if anybody needs to camp out at any
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever the pragmatist, Montgomery added, ``But if there's a threat
of not getting tickets, I guess you have to make a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery has built a solid program at Stanford (which has had
an exceptional women's program for years) since leaving Montana in
1986. He had six 20-game winners and five NCAA Tournament clubs
going into last year, when all heck broke loose. The Cardinal won
its first 18 games and ended up in the Final Four, losing to
Kentucky, 86-85, in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   With all five starters, and the top eight scorers, back this
year, the polls and others in the prediction game have responded
accordingly. In the Associated Press media poll released Thursday,
Stanford is third.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery responded accordingly, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's flattering people think enough of us to put us in
the Top 10,'' he said. ``Certainly it's not unexpected. I just hope
people recognize it for what it is, and not make too much of it.
But we're going to enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   The players are probably better equipped than most to deal with
all the hype, mainly because they have other things in their lives.
Also, Stanford takes the team concept to ridiculous lengths. Last
year, 10 players averaged at least 10 minutes a game and no one
averaged more than 14.5 points. And few teams put forth a
comparably consistent, grinding, physical effort game after game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very competitive in practice,'' guard Kris Weems said,
``which makes the games easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Weems for the most part doesn't buy into the Stanford-Duke
comparison. For one thing, he said, Stanford is a tougher place to
gain admission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really feel our academic standards are tougher for
athletes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he said, ``Duke has been doing it for a long
time.'' And, campus life at Stanford seems to be more diverse.
Weems generally downplays the basketball renaissance, which is fine
with Montgomery. But certain facts are obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always assumed people were not going to take that big of an
interest in basketball,'' Weems said. ``But now they're starting
to.'' &QL;

SPRINT OFFERS MONTHLY PLAN FOR UNLIMITED LONG DISTANCE CALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For decades, consumers have paid a little more with each passing
minute they spent on the phone making a long-distance call. This
weekend that will begin to change.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking with longstanding practice in the $80 billion
long-distance market, Sprint Corp. introduced an all-you-can-eat
pricing plan Thursrday that allows consumers to make unlimited
long-distance calls on the weekend for $25 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The marketing wars in the long-distance business are among the
fiercest in any industry, with Sprint, AT&AMP;T and MCI Worldcom each
spending millions each year to win the ears and mouths of consumers
everywhere. The new Sprint Unlimited plan seems sure to give
Sprint, the No. 3 long-distance carrier, a big boost in that
battle.
</P>
<P>
   If the plan proves both popular with consumers and profitable
for Sprint, it could usher in a time when people could elect to pay
a flat charge for unlimited long-distance calls all week,
eliminating the cringe factor when the phone bill arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Internet users have enjoyed unlimited-use plans for years. Most
people _ except those in much of New York City, of course _ can
make unlimited local phone calls without incurring additional
charges. Most cable television channels offer unlimited viewing for
a flat monthly fee.
</P>
<P>
   But pricing plans in the long-distance business have remained
resolutely a la carte. Even as the long-distance giants have
started offering special calling plans that eliminate different
rates based on geographic distance, those charges have remained
resolutely per-minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole notion that a caller can get on the phone and not
worry about how long they are on the call is pretty
revolutionary,'' said Rebecca Sachs, a spokeswoman for the
Telecommunications Research and Action Center, a nonprofit research
group in Washington. ``It is consistent with attitudes people have
about the Internet. You don't think about sending e-mail to people
in Asia or how long your message is.''
</P>
<P>
   But do not try to send e-mail with Sprint's new plan. The catch
in the program is that Sprint intends the service to be used only
for voice calls and will try to ferret out those who use the plan
for modems, fax machines or other data services.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not available for data usage, Internet connections,
because of the usage profile that would be associated with ongoing
data connections,'' said Tim Kelly, a Sprint vice president for
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   In other words: people spend so much time on line that if they
used the Sprint Unlimited plan to make long-distance calls into the
Internet, Sprint could end up having a hard time making money on
the program.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Sprint is that the new program could end up
being highly attractive to cyberspace denizens and fax users. The
America Online phone lines in your area are jammed or cranky? Try
California. Want to send faxes to a few hundred friends? Wait until
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll monitor the network to identify that,'' Kelly said. ``We
have ways of tracking it.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that Sprint would not monitor calls but would instead
analyze use patterns to figure out whether consumers are making
unauthorized use of the program. Customers who use a modem could be
kicked off the plan.
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom already offers a 5- cent-a-minute rate on Sundays
and AT&AMP;T offers a 5-cent-a-minute rate all weekend. That means that
users would have to make about two hours of calls every weekend to
make the Sprint plan economical.
</P>
<P>
   The Sprint plan is available nationwide and allows users to make
unlimited calls to anywhere in the country on the weekend. During
the week, calls cost 10 cents a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said that the plan would have a positive effect on
Sprint's financial results. But Eric Strumingher, an analyst for
Paine Webber, estimated that Sprint must pay about 5.5 cents a
minute to local phone companies for beginning and ending
long-distance calls.
</P>
<P>
   That means that the program could potentially hurt Sprint's
financial performance if many of its customers signed up for the
program and then switched a lot of their calling from the week to
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   An MCI Worldcom spokesman said his company had no plans to offer
an unlimited-use plan. AT&AMP;T said that it would consider such a plan
if its customers asked for it.

FLORIDA IS HIT BY REMNANTS OF HURRICANE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ After devastating Honduras and Nicaragua as a hurricane,
the tropical storm struck Florida on Wednesday night, causing only
moderate damage as the fast-moving system crossed the state in less
than 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the storm, called Mitch, whipped up 55 mph winds, dumped
at least three inches of rain and spawned several tornadoes in
South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Keys, which were still recovering from the effects
of Hurricane Georges less than two months ago, suffered the brunt
of the damage. In the upper Keys, Mitch's winds knocked over trees
and power lines and yanked off parts of roofs, causing the most
destruction to mobile homes in Key Largo. About 12,000 people lost
electricity; the local electric company, The Florida Keys Co-op,
was restoring power Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, about 60,000 residents in Dade and Broward
counties suffered power failures.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 people sustained minor injuries, local officials
reported.
</P>
<P>
   By 4 p.m. Thursday, with rains and winds considerably calmed,
the National Hurricane Center in Miami issued its last advisory on
the once-deadly storm that meteorologists had watched closely for
almost two weeks. It had moved off the east coast of Florida and
was about 100 miles northeast of Little Abaco Island in the
Bahamas.

UCLA COULD CHALLENGE STANFORD THIS SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Having someone other than Stanford favored to win
Pac-10 women's basketball for the first time in a decade is about
time to some, audacious to others.
</P>
<P>
   For no matter what happened at the end of last season and how
many players are gone to the pros, this is Stanford, the four-time
defending champion that has lost two of 72 conference games over
that span.
</P>
<P>
   But the media predicts this is the season of change, that UCLA
with its fabled 1996 recruiting class now juniors will bump the
Cardinal down a rung. Even the coaches agree, giving the Bruins the
edge in their poll, but Stanford's Tara VanDerveer is far from
bothered by the doubters.
</P>
<P>
   Her prediction Thursday at Pac-10 Media Day: ``We will be (in
the national Top 10),'' when postseason play begins to determine
who Stanford will play host to during the NCAA Final Four, March
26-28 in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is staying healthy. We have athleticism, better
team speed. I honestly think we can be better than last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is saying something since the Cardinal was a virtual given
for a fourth straight Final Four berth until that fateful week of
pre-tournament practice when Kristin Folkl and Vanessa Nygaard were
lost with severe knee injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was absolutely numbing,'' VanDerveer said. ``It felt so
surreal,'' particularly the end result, a 71-67 first-round NCAA
loss on its home court to Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   How much more surreal, then, that within 10 minutes of each
other during practice Oct. 19, two starters suffered what were
first diagnosed as 6-8 week injuries. Senior forward Regan Freuen
(sprained tendon right foot) could indeed be out that long, but
prized 6-foot-1 freshman guard Lindsey Yamasaki (arthroscopic right
knee surgery) is ahead of rehab schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The absences _ and departures of Olympia Scott, Heather Owen,
Folkl and Nygaard _ give weight to the polls, including the
Associated Press national top 25 to be released today that also is
likely to favor UCLA over Stanford. But to bale too early on the
Farm would be a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you overlook Tara, for her it's more of a
challenge,'' said UCLA Coach Kathy Olivier. ``You never take
Stanford lightly. They're young, but Lindsey comes out of a high
level program (four-time Oregon 4A champion Oregon City High
School). It's not that big of a jump for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus VanDerveer is ready to unveil 6-6 center Carolyn Moos, who
had 25 points in an exhibition win Monday, and backs her with 6-7
freshman Cori Enghusen. Another freshman, Lauren St. Clair, will
receive significant minutes at least until Freun and Yamasaki
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great time for Stanford basketball,'' VanDerveer said,
with the men ranked second nationally in the AP poll. ``Our players
are working hard to hold up their end of the bargain.'' &QL;

DISHMAN MAY START VS. 'SKINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Cardinals coaches might have to lasso offensive
guard  &UR; Chris Dishman to keep him out of the starting lineup Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Dishman, who has missed four consecutive games because of a neck
injury, participated in contact drills Thursday and didn't
experience any pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great,'' said Dishman, a second-year pro from Nebraska.
``I feel perfect. I feel back to normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach  &UR; Vince Tobin said that Dishman could start Sunday at left
guard against the Washington Redskins if he doesn't have any
``setbacks'' the rest of this week.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said  &UR; Jerome Daniels, who has replaced Dishman the past
four weeks, and  &UR; Matt Joyce also likely would play at left guard in
the game. &QL; 
Making progress
</P>
<P>
   Starting cornerback  &UR; Tom Knight, out the past four games because
of a hamstring/knee injury, still isn't at full speed but likely
will return to action Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He worked with the first unit in nickel coverage on Thursday but
was on the second team behind  &UR; J.B.  &UR; Brown in all other drills. &QL; 
More good news
</P>
<P>
   After missing last Sunday's game with a calf injury, starting
running back  &UR; Adrian Murrell tested the leg Thursday in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first day I really tried to press on it,'' Murrell
said of the calf. ``I felt good. I'm excited about this weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Murrell was a late scratch against Detroit. &QL; 
Metcalf ailing
</P>
<P>
   The tendinitis in  &UR; Eric Metcalf's left leg forced him to miss
Thursday's workout, but Tobin thinks Metcalf will be able to play
against the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   If he can't play, he would be replaced at slot receiver by  &UR; Fred
 &UR; Brock and  &UR; Ronnie Anderson, who hasn't played this season.
</P>
<P>
   Brock would handle Metcalf's punt-return duties. The kick-return
job would go to Brock,  &UR; Mario Bates or rookie  &UR; Michael Pittman. &QL; 
Getting comfortable
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Cardinals played the Redskins, quarterback
 &UR; Jake
 &UR; Plummer threw for 337 yards and four touchdowns against them at Sun
Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just going out there and playing,'' Plummer said.
``Against the Giants last year, I also threw for a lot of yards and
this year did nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer threw for an NFL single-game rookie record 388 yards at
Giants Stadium a year ago but had only 139 yards there earlier this
season. Thinking sometimes can get in the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, last year I was just worried about getting the ball
out of my hands and into somebody else's,'' Plummer said. ``You can
only live by that so long before teams will shut you down.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a period of time when I struggle with it. But
there will be a time when I sit back there like  &UR; Warren Moon, who
looks like he's reading a book and sipping tea back there.'' &QL; 
Short shots
</P>
<P>
   Washington offensive lineman  &UR; Joe  &UR; Patton (hamstring) and
running back
 &UR; Terry Allen (ankle) were downgraded to doubtful on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's game will be blacked out. There have been 42,219
tickets distributed. &QL;

SOME VOTERS SUGGEST NEGATIVE ADS BACKFIRED IN N.C. 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ Jean Carpenter, a registered Republican and
sometime independent voter, said she expected more from a candidate
than mean-hearted language, negative, simple-minded advertisements
and rigidly partisan politics.
</P>
<P>
   That is why, on Tuesday at least, Ms. Carpenter pulled a
Democratic lever in the North Carolina race for the U.S. Senate
between the incumbent Republican, Lauch Faircloth, and his
challenger, John Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Kary Schmidt, who voted for Bob Dole in 1996 because she liked
his character, said she had voted against Faircloth because she
liked his Democratic challenger's ideals _ because he seemed to
have some.
</P>
<P>
   Patty Hutchins, a registered Republican in Charlotte, voted
Democrat in the Senate race because she grew sick of advertisements
in which Faircloth compared Edwards to President Clinton. Ms.
Hutchins said that she kept waiting to hear talk _ serious talk _
about issues but that it seemed to come mostly from the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   No one is quite sure yet how many Republicans actually turned
against their party's candidates on Tuesday, either by voting
against them or not casting a vote for a specific office while
still voting Republican for others. It may be, here in North
Carolina as elsewhere, that Democrats just turned out better than
disgruntled or unmotivated Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Carolinas, especially North Carolina, the election of
the relatively obscure Edwards, a Raleigh trial lawyer making his
first race for political office, capped off what has been heralded
as a great day for a party _both in the state and elsewhere in the
country _ that could use a little good news.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. L. Melvin Watt, a Democrat from Charlotte, became the first
black candidate in North Carolina to win in a majority white
district _ the district lines had been redrawn _ while Democrats
unseated Republicans on county commissions and other, local races.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the victory by Edwards that most people here wanted
to talk about, perhaps because some voters said his opponent ran
not so much on any political ideology as on criticism of Democrats
_ including advertisements showing Clinton and Edwards side by
side, their noses growing like Pinocchio's.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Lew, a Charlotte Republican, did not cast a ballot in the
Senate race, voting Republican for others but not backing an
incumbent who ran such a negative campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just couldn't pull the trigger for him,'' Lew said.
</P>
<P>
   But ``they should not take this as a mandate,'' he said,
referring to an Election Day in which Democrats nudged Republicans
from North Carolina offices ranging from the U.S. Senate to the
Mecklenburg Board of County Commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Lew and other Republicans said, their party should take
it as an appeal for something more than they were getting,
something beyond Clinton-bashing.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carpenter, of Fayettevile, a 50-year-old insurance
coordinator for a construction company, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just silly,'' she said, ``and voting to me has always
been sort of serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican candidates seemed to bank too much on resentment over
Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think what he did was impeachable,'' Lew said. ``It's
just not a big issue.''
</P>
<P>
   National Republicans leaders, like Speaker Newt Gingrich,
acknowledged that Republicans had not given supporters enough
reasons to vote for a candidate, as opposed to reasons to vote
against the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Patty Hutchens, a Republican who works in an accounting office,
said that she wanted to hear candidates talk about about serious
issues like jobs but that she got negative advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care for it,'' Ms. Hutchens said, so she voted for the
candidate who was the target of those advertisements, Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Carpenter, too, it was more a vote against the
Republican incumbent than for the Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did nothing but negative ads, the last two weeks,'' she
said. ``You have to go with your instinct. You can't vote the
straight ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said Edwards had simply won them over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I vote for the candidate,'' said Ms. Schmidt, who designs
instruction programs for computers, so she had often voted
Republican, as she did in the 1996 presidential election. This
time, the issue of character caused her to turn against the
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked that he seemed to be idealistic,'' she said of
Edwards, adding that she was looking for a candidate who would
``make practical decisions based not on party politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Other voters said that the Republican turncoats had little to do
with the race and that it was just a greater turnout by registered
Democrats. Whatever the reasons, it was good news for people like
Barbara Rosenberg, an office worker.
</P>
<P>
   Most election mornings, lately, it seems as if the Republicans
have just claimed more and more offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, after an Election Day,'' Ms. Rosenberg said, ``I feel
sick.''

TIME TO WAKE UP, TAKE THE SLEEP ERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This time of year, most fantasy leagues break into two camps _
the guys stocking up on players for the playoffs, and the guys
starting
 &UR; Kerry Collins at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it. Eight or nine losses will take the sizzle out of
any fantasy season. And after you lose interest, you tend to send
in some, uh, interesting lineups to the commissioner's office _ if
you send in any lineup at all.
</P>
<P>
   But there's still some fun to be had. It's always a great joy to
sneak up on one of those playoff-bound teams and knock it for a
loop. And if you're headed for the playoffs, there are still some
players out there to grab before the trading deadline hits.
</P>
<P>
   Some second-half sleepers, division by division:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NFC EAST: Can anybody play this game? Actually, they can, just
not in the worst division in football. After watching an average
Cowboys team walk all over the Eagles on Monday night, I'm tempted
to warn you away from the whole division. But what fun would that
be?
</P>
<P>
   I'd take a look at the  &UR; Davis brothers:  &UR; Billy, the Dallas wide
receiver, and  &UR; Stephen, the Redskins running back. (Dear Irate
Caller: Yes, I realize they are not really brothers. Please go back
to watching ``Wrestlemania XIX''.)
</P>
<P>
   I also like Giants running back  &UR; Gary Brown and his teammate,
wide receiver  &UR; Ike Hilliard, as well as Washington running back
 &UR; Skip Hicks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NFC CENTRAL: This is one talent-laden division. Most of the
name players have been grabbed up, but there are a few decent guys
who may still be out there in your league.
</P>
<P>
   I like Bucs receiver  &UR; Reidel Anthony and Packers running back
 &UR; Travis
 &UR; Jervey. On the Vikings, try tight end  &UR; Andrew Glover or running
back
 &UR; Leroy Hoard, who gets the ball near the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NFC WEST: If your league is anything like mine, every 49er with
a pulse has been picked. So try some of the other teams.
</P>
<P>
   On the Saints, I like tight end  &UR; Cam Cleeland and former Arizona
State wide receiver  &UR; Keith Poole, who has gotten open deep a few
times and had five catches for 90 yards against Carolina last week.
Falcons tight end  &UR; O.J. Santiago is a keeper.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AFC EAST: Buffalo Coach  &UR; Wade Phillips finally wised up and
named
 &UR; Doug Flutie the starter over  &UR; Rob Johnson, who has been playing bad
and getting hurt, not necessarily in that order.
</P>
<P>
   As for tight ends, how about a story about a man named  &UR; Brady,
as in
 &UR; Kyle, who has been ripped in this space before but may be the real
deal. Buffalo's  &UR; Jay Riemersma is worth grabbing as well. I also
like Jets running back  &UR; Leon Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AFC CENTRAL: Receivers  &UR; Courtney Hawkins and  &UR; Charles Johnson
have come alive for the Steelers. If someone gave up on Johnson in
your league, it might be worth picking him back up.
</P>
<P>
   I also like Baltimore running back  &UR; Roosevelt Potts, who's been
getting some reps for the Ravens lately. With  &UR; Keenan McCardell
hurt, Jaguars receiver  &UR; Reggie Barlow should get some action.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AFC WEST: Carlester Crumpler lives! The Seattle tight end had
five catches against the Raiders on Sunday and should remain a
target for
 &UR; Warren Moon or for whoever subs for him after his broken body is
scraped from the turf.
</P>
<P>
   Running back  &UR; Bam Morris may take away  &UR; Donnell Bennett's
starting job in Kansas City. Chiefs wide receiver  &UR; Derrick
Alexander is finally healthy and worth a look. I also like Chargers
wide receiver  &UR; Mikhael
 &UR; Ricks, even if it is a chore to spell his name. &QL; 
Tip of the week &QL; 
Stay away from Colts running back  &UR; Marshall Faulk against the
Dolphins this week. Miami held the Colts to 64 yards rushing in the
opener. &QL; 
Waiver wire &QL; 
Dump Kansas City tight end  &UR; Tony Gonzalez and pick up somebody
better. Saints wide receiver  &UR; Sean Dawkins might be worth a look. &QL; 
Bill Muller's Fantasy Football notebook appears every Friday. He
can be reached at 602-444-8178 or at bill.muller(at)pni.com via
e-mail. &QL;

MITCH'S VICTIMS SCRAPE THROUGH MUD IN SEARCH OF SURVIVAL

<P>
   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras _ While rescue crews used dogs to search a
collapsed hillside for the bodies of Hurricane Mitch's victims on
Thursday, ragged teen-agers worked nearby, bagging sand to sell to
construction workers.
</P>
<P>
   At a Western Union office, Blanca Nubia Herrera waited in line
most of the afternoon, hoping to receive money from her brother in
Atlanta to help her cope with the loss of her home and most of her
family's possessions.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the countless poor neighborhoods near the center of
this desperately poor city, Vicky Barahona said she had found a way
to provide water to her seven children while the municipal water
system is out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may give my children diarrhea, but I don't think it will
kill them,'' the 35-year-old mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Barahona said she and her neighbors placed a bucket on a rope
and lowered it down a manhole to collect muddy water dripping from
a small plastic pipe. Barahona hopes the water is not contaminated
with sewage.
</P>
<P>
   A week after devastating rains from Hurricane Mitch brought
lethal floods and slides to the capital city of Honduras, the
people of Tegucigalpa have been forced to improvise just to get by.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say the storm left hundreds of people dead and more
than 16,000 people homeless in this city alone.
</P>
<P>
   After sitting off the Honduran coast for several days last week,
Mitch marched across Central America, leaving a trail of death and
destruction, before entering the Gulf of Mexico and moving to the
northeast. On Thursday, the remnants of Mitch crossed southern
Florida and headed into the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The official estimate of Mitch-related deaths throughout Central
America rose to more than 10,000 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In Honduras, officials revised their estimate on the number of
dead from 7,000 to 6,000. Thousands of people, however, remain
missing, and the extent of the devastation in much of the country
remains unknown.
</P>
<P>
   In Nicaragua, the government raised the death toll to 4,000, up
from 1,452, and said that hundreds of bodies swept away by
floodwaters had been found in canals along the Pacific Coast.
</P>
<P>
   El Salvador, Guatemala, Costa Rica and Mexico also have reported
Mitch-related deaths.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton ordered that $70 million in aid
be sent to Central American countries devastated by Mitch and said
he would dispatch Tipper Gore, wife of Vice President Al Gore, to
the region. First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton added Nicaragua and
Honduras to the itinerary of a trip she had planned to Haiti and
the Dominican Republic later this month.
</P>
<P>
   In Nicaragua, rescuers continued to search the slopes of a
dormant volcano near the city of Chinandega, where at least 2,000
people were killed by a massive mudslide caused by Mitch's rains
early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful of an outbreak of cholera and other disease, search
teams continued burying bodies found in the thick ooze, which at
points reached depths of five feet or more. There were reports that
some victims remain trapped alive in the deep mud.
</P>
<P>
   The Nicaraguan government warned that thousands of
anti-personnel mines _ planted around bridges and dams in the 1980s
during the socialist Sandinista government's war with U.S.-backed
rebels _ were washed away by the floods and posed a grave hazard to
farmers. French mine experts flew into both Nicaragua and Honduras
to help search for the explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Nicaraguan army troops and private contractors continued working
Thursday to repair or replace bridges swept away by the storm. But
traffic on the main highway between Managua and the country's
second largest city, Leon, remained halting at every river and
stream.
</P>
<P>
   Adriana Silva, a 22-year-old mother of two spent Thursday
tacking plastic sheeting over her family's tiny shack in the
roadside village of El Ciebo. The sheet-metal walls of Silva's
house _ and about everything else the family owned _ was washed
away by the floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
   Silva's food supply for her family of four consists of a
two-pound sack of rice, a pound of black beans and several green
bananas stored in a plastic bucket. A marginally better-off
relative donated the food earlier in the week, Silva said. She
doesn't expect to get any more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a spoon, a fork, a bowl to hold food with,''
said Alejandro Mendoza, a 46-year-old whose house was carried away
by the torrent in the village of Reparto. ``We're alive. But we got
out with just the clothes on our backs.''
</P>
<P>
   Limited amounts of food, medicine and other supplies, however,
have begun to reach refugees gathered in makeshift shelters in
Leon, Chinandega and nearby towns.
</P>
<P>
   In Tegucigalpa, where Mitch's rain showered down for nearly five
days, landslides took out entire poor neighborhoods. Floodwaters
covered much of downtown, even on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This city is paralyzed,'' said Roberto Dimas Alonso, the head
of COPECO, the Honduran relief agency.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of Comayaguela, Tegucigalpa's run-down sister city, were
devastated when the Choluteca River, which divides the two cities,
overflowed and washed away houses, a coffee factory and parts of
the prison and central market. Two of the four bridges connecting
the cities collapsed into a heap of concrete into the roiling brown
waters.
</P>
<P>
   The two remaining bridges are open only to foot traffic. On
Thursday, instead of directing motorists, police waved thousands of
pedestrians on their way to their jobs across one of the spans in
single file. Dozens of vultures sat on the roof of the Comayaguela
market, occasionally swooping down into the river to scour for dead
pigs.
</P>
<P>
   The headquarters of the Honduran Red Cross in Tegucigalpa was
swept away, adding problems to the relief effort.
</P>
<P>
   The Honduran capital city also lost its leader to the storm. The
popular mayor of Tegucigalpa, Cesar Castellano, died in a
helicopter crash while viewing damage to the city on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the city's dead have been buried in mass graves. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Relief supplies have been unable to reach the city of 800,000
along the country's highway system, much of which has been
destroyed or remains impassable. Food and other essentials are in
short supply.
</P>
<P>
   At one gasoline station, taxi drivers lined up all day, but the
station never opened. Around the corner, people seeking kerosene
formed a line outside a store displaying a sign that said there was
no kerosene for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Free-lance journalist Edward Hegstrom reported on this story
from Tegucigalpa. Chronicle staff writer Dudley Althaus reported
from Nicaragua. &QL;

 &HT;    Trickle's first pole of '98 comes easy
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ That the last shall be first came to be again
Thursday. Dick Trickle, No. 52 in the Busch Series qualifying
order, won the pole for Saturday's Stihl 300 at Atlanta Motor
Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Trickle, 57, a Wisconsin native, ran 186.673 mph to win his
first pole of the year and sixth of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Trickle made it look simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were fourth fastest right off the truck. After that, I
drove only seven practice laps, all wide open once we got through
the gears,'' Trickle said. Matt Kenseth claimed the outside pole
with a speed of 185.778 mph. Mike McLaughlin was third, 185.610
mph. Atlanta's Buckshot Jones was 14th, 184.615 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Other Winston Cup drivers in the top 10: Joe Nemechek, fifth,
185.468; Dale Jarrett, eighth, 185.071; and Mark Martin, 10th,
184.917.
</P>
<P>
   For sale
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen hundred additional tickets go on sale this morning for
Sunday's NAPA 500. The $55 seats are located above turn one and
will be sold on a first-come, first-come basis. Tickets also remain
available for tonight's ARCA Winn Dixie 250 and Saturday's Busch
Stihl 300.
</P>
<P>
   ARCA seconds
</P>
<P>
   Rick Skinner led second-round qualifying for today's Winn Dixie
250. It's only the third ARCA start for the Medford, N.J., native,
who last weekend won the WKA World Unlimited Enduro Karting
championship at Charlotte. He finished 16th in both Pocono races
this year. ``Heck, the karts I run are the lay-down kind, and we
hit speeds of well over 150 miles per hour. Those are scarier than
these cars are,'' Skinner said.
</P>
<P>
   Crew chief change
</P>
<P>
   Greg Zipadelli is the new crew chief for Joe Gibbs Racing and
driver Tony Stewart for the '99 Winston Cup season. He comes to his
new job from Roush Racing, where he was the chassis expert for Jeff
Burton. ``Zappi's'' background is the short tracks in the
Northeast, where he worked for Busch North series champion Mike
Stefanik.
</P>
<P>
   NAPA and Hornaday
</P>
<P>
   NAPA will sponsor a Dale Earnhardt-prepared Chevrolet Monte
Carlo for Craftsman Truck star Ron Hornaday in the NAPA Auto Parts
300 Busch race in February at Daytona International Speedway.
``I've always dreamed of racing at Daytona,'' Hornaday said. ``I
told Dale that I didn't care what I raced at Daytona when I went to
work for him _ horses, go-karts, bicycles. I just wanted to one day
race there. This is a dream come true.'' Hornaday is the winningest
drive in the truck series (23) and has more than $2million in
earnings.

 &HT;    Drivers: Skill best safety weapon on slowed AMS
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ That collective sigh of relief this week emanating
from stock car racing shops throughout the Southeast could have
been because of NASCAR's decision to increase the size of spoilers
before putting the cars on the unbelievably fast track of Atlanta
Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   The spoiler change is expected to give drivers much better
control of their cars on a track that carries a perception of speed
and danger.
</P>
<P>
   How fast is Atlanta?
</P>
<P>
   _ Last November, Geoff Bodine qualified with a track record of
197.478 mph. That's about four or five mph faster than the top
qualifying run at Daytona on a track that is a half-mile shorter.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the spring, John Andretti put his Pontiac on the pole with
a speed of 192.956 mph.
</P>
<P>
   _ The ARCA race was a demolition derby. Fifty of the 77 laps
were run under caution, the most ever for that circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of places that are too fast, but that's just the
nature of the sport,'' driver Bobby Hamilton said. ``I don't
understand people complaining. If you don't like going fast, you
should have played chess or something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   When the NAPA 500 begins on Sunday, technology will prevail. On
the same track in 1971, for example, 162 mph was not too fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now you have single-carbureted motors, five-inch spoilers,
and 730 horsepower and guys running 185 miles an hour in Atlanta,''
Hamilton said. ``That's the technology, and the drivers not having
sense enough to let up off the gas. A perfect example: Bodine runs
197 in qualifying, and they said, `Can you run that?' I said,
`Yeah, but I'm not going to.' We've got a gas pedal; we don't have
to go that fast.
</P>
<P>
   Restrictor plates have been mentioned as a slow-down cure for
Atlanta, but Dale Jarrett doesn't agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us want that,'' he said. ``When they changed the track
(before the November, 1997 race), they created more problems for us
because of the new surface and how they designed the track. It's a
situation where you understand going in that it's going to be fast,
and as long as nothing happens, everybody can handle those
situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``But faster doesn't make for better racing,'' he said. ``And as
we go faster it takes away more control that we have, and therefore
you lose putting on a good show for the fans. They want the racing
to be better, and the only way we can race is to get these cars
back with downforce and create a situation where, if you miss the
setup a little bit, you can still race pretty fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you miss it now with the reduced downforce we have,''
Jarrett said, ``the car doesn't drive good, and it shows up on the
race track that if somebody gets hooked up they pretty much can
beat the field pretty bad, and it doesn't look like we're having
good racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Penske acknowledges that teams are running faster here
than at other tracks. The G forces are greater because of the
banking, something that Penske says needs to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You run a restrictor or you don't,'' Penske said.
``Unfortunately, with restrictor plates, there's no ability to use
the throttle to get yourself out of trouble. So basically, I think
it's going to have to be another race to get the data and make a
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``These fellows know how to run fast together,'' he said, ``and
it's going to be up to the drivers to communicate to NASCAR to
determine should they have more spoiler or go to restrictor
plates.''
</P>
<P>
   Penske also said: ``I would say restrictor plates don't give you
the opportunity to get out of trouble if your car isn't handling
the way you want it. On the other hand, if you go to more spoiler,
you're going to create more speed in the corner and be able to run
wide open. But you start running wide open, and sometimes those
wrecks are worse because once the car breaks loose, you have no
ability to control the car at that high G loading.''
</P>
<P>
   Bodine says nobody will come close to last November's lap. The
cars are slower, the engines have a little less power, the tires
are somewhat tougher, and the track is worn down some. ``The track
will never be faster than when it's brand new,'' Bodine said.
``Race speeds will be slower, maybe more consistent. It should be a
better race, because it will have more than one groove.''
</P>
<P>
   The last word comes from team owner Michael Kranefuss.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't even thought about it. I don't see any reason to
even discuss it. It's the same race track as Charlotte, Michigan or
Fontana (California). All of them are fast. You've got to have your
stuff together. It's racing; it's all relative. You use your foot
when you need to.

 &HT;    Tubby's 'Cats, Lady Vols are top SEC picks
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ For the second time in three years, the SEC
has two teams defending national championships, which normally
would be a sign of a strong league. Yet the Kentucky men and the
Tennessee women are heavy preseason favorites as runaway SEC
winners once again.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats, who won a surprise national title in former
Georgia coach Tubby Smith's first season in Lexington, were chosen
by SEC media to win the league title once again, getting 17 votes,
to just three for Tennessee, which is a darkhorse pick in some
circles. Arkansas garnered a single vote.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Smith is wary of declaring his team the frontrunner. He lost
seniors Jeff Sheppard, Allen Edwards and Cameron Mills as well as
center Nazr Mohammed, who turned pro with a year of eligibility
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``The senior leadership last year was the best I've ever been
around,'' Smith said. ``Our seniors this year have that kind of
potential, but it's going to be tough to replace what we had last
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Point guard Wayne Turner and forward Scott Padgett are the two
returning senior starters inheriting that role, but Smith thinks
the contribution of his incoming players, especially Desmond
Allison and Tayshaun Price, will be important. ``We're going to
have to have younger players contribute sooner than our younger
players did last year,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's women, winners of the last three NCAA crowns, have
no such problems.
</P>
<P>
   Only one senior graduated from a 39-0 team that returns
All-Americans Chamique Holdsclaw and Tamika Catchings and welcomes
two of the top high school post prospects in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the biggest question may not be if the Lady Volunteers
become the first women's team to win four titles in a row, but if
they do, whether it would be in perfect style once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about that,'' coach Pat Summitt said. ``We
never intended to go undefeated last year, especially not when you
play in the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to be in that national championship game.''
</P>
<P>
   McKie, Holdsclaw tapped
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina senior guard B.J. McKie and forward Chamique
Holdsclaw of Tennessee were near-unanimous choices for preseason
SEC player of the years honors. McKie got 16 votes, with Georgia's
Jumaine Jones coming in second with three. Turner and Tennessee's
Tony Harris got a vote apiece. Dominique Canty of Alabama was the
only other female player who got votes. She received two. ... The
preseason All-SEC men's team includes McKie, Jones, Harris, Padgett
and Mississippi State center Tyrone Washington. Holdsclaw is joined
by Canty, Catchings and Semeka Randall of Tennessee and Auburn's
Conswella Sparrow. ... The Georgia men were picked to finish fourth
in the SEC East, while the Georgia women were chosen second behind
Tennessee.

 &HT;    Patriots missing several starters
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This is getting to be a regular thing. When the
Falcons (6-2) play at New England (5-3) on Sunday, they'll face a
team for the second week in a row that is hamstrung in the passing
game, and beat up in general.
</P>
<P>
   By all appearances the Patriots will be without starting WR
Terry Glenn (hamstring), and backups Troy Brown (ankle) and Vincent
Brisby (foot). Also, starting WR Shawn Jefferson almost certainly
will play, but he has bruised ribs.
</P>
<P>
   Things are so bad for the Pats they signed Henry Ellard, 37,
away from a high school assistant-coaching job last week, and he
caught three passes in a 21-16 win over the Colts.
</P>
<P>
   In last Sunday's 37-15 win over the Rams, St. Louis was missing
leading receiver Isaac Bruce, a WR, and second-leading receiver Amp
Lee, a RB, and fourth-leading receiver and TE Ernie Conwell.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, DE Willie McGinest, an top-notch pass rusher who has
missed the past two games with a groin injury, practiced Thursday,
but DT Henry Thomas (sprained ankle) did not. He was on crutches.
</P>
<P>
   DT Chad Eaton (bruised thigh) has been slowed, and fourth-round
draft choice Leonta Rheams, a DT, has been bumped from the practice
squad to the active roster.
</P>
<P>
   FB Tony Carter, who underwent arthroscopic knee surgery three
weeks ago, is out, and the starter will be rookie Chris Floyd,
giving New England an all- first-year backfield with former Georgia
star Robert Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Admiring Anderson
</P>
<P>
   Patriots reserve DT Mark Wheeler came away from film sessions
impressed with Falcons RB Jamal Anderson. ``He reminds me of ``the
Bus'' (Pittsburgh's Jerome Bettis), except that he's faster,''
Wheeler said. ``Everybody in the NFL is good, but he's real good.''
</P>
<P>
   Lagging late
</P>
<P>
   After losing their opener to Denver, the Patriots reeled off
four straight wins, and when they beat the Chiefs 40-10, they were
being called one of the premier teams in the NFL. They're widely
considered to have one of the most talented rosters, but they've
struggled in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   They led the Jets, at home, 14-10 going to the fourth quarter,
but lost 24-14. And two weeks ago, they had a 9-6 lead at Miami
with two minutes left, but lost 12-9 in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   For the season, they've been outscored 58-47 in the fourth
quarter and overtime. They hold edges in the other three quarters,
37-27 in the first, 64-33 in the second, and 43-20 in the third.
</P>
<P>
   The Pats have one rushing TD all season in the fourth quarter,
and rank 21st in the NFL in fourth-quarter passing, completing 50.9
percent with three TDs.
</P>
<P>
   Dominant ``D''
</P>
<P>
   The New England defense saved last Sunday's 21-16 win over the
lowly Colts. It took two interceptions by SS Lawyer Milloy in the
final minutes of the game to preserve the win, and Indy rushed for
just 32 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Milloy, who has four of the Patriots' NFL-best 13 interceptions,
is not especially strong in man-on-man coverage, but is solid
against the run, as is the entire New England defense.
</P>
<P>
   CB Ty Law (5-11, 200 pounds), who is tied for the NFL lead with
five interceptions, is having an outstanding season, and plays the
physical style of bump-and-run defense that sometimes gives Atlanta
WRs Terance Mathis and Tony Martin trouble _ much like Jets CBs
Aaron Glenn and Otis Smith two weeks ago. The other CB, Chris
Canty, a second-year pro from Kansas State, continues to struggle.
He also was arrested and charged Wednesday morning for driving with
an open container of beer.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots blitz in all manners, and from all angles, often
sending SLB Chris Slade, or ``nickel'' LB Tedy Brusch.
</P>
<P>
   New England is No. 2 in the NFL against the run, allowing just
76.9 yards per game. Ted Johnson, a former second-round choice from
Colorado, is one of the top three or four middle linebackers in the
NFL. He has been in on 91 tackles.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' injury situation improved some, as the team spent
half of practice in pads, and half in ``shells.'' WR Todd Kinchen,
who suffered a concussion last week against the Rams, practiced,
and is almost certain to play. ... DT Travis Hall, however, could
miss his third straight game as he recovers from arthroscopic
surgery to remove debris from behind a knee cap. He is listed as
doubtful. If he practices today, he could be upgraded to
questionable. ... No other injuries are serious, excluding the knee
injuries that will keep CB Ronnie Bradford and WR-RB Tim Dwight out
Sunday, and likely a minimum of at least one more game.
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have in hand a return proposal from Furman
University regarding next summer's training camp being held at the
Greenville, S.C., campus, but there's work to be done. There are
still hangups regarding logistical matters related to the way the
team will be billed for dining, security personnel, and usage of
certain facilities and more. Front office officials likely will
drive to Greenville next week for more talks.. ... Sunday will be
the first time Atlanta has played at New England since 1986, a
25-17 win for the Patriots. The Falcons beat the Patriots in
Atlanta in '89, '92, and '95, and lead the all-time series 5-3. ...
Falcons LB coach Don Blackmon played linebacker for the Patriots
from '81-'87, and his safety of former Tampa Bay QB Steve DeBerg in
'85, was the last for a New England player. ... Falcons C Robbie
Tobeck and Patriots QB Drew Bledsoe were teammates at Washington
State, and the two former roommates are close friends. Tobeck was
the best man in Bledsoe's wedding.

 &HT;    Burning up NFL: Falcons'Anderson torched house as youngster
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Falcons running back Jamal Anderson always has a story
to tell or a spin to sell, and sometimes a little of both.
Thursday's edition was a doozy.
</P>
<P>
   When Anderson was 6 years old, he and younger brother Jaleel
were misbehaving at home near Newark, N.J. The Anderson family of
10, including mom Zenobia and dad James were preparing to move to
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going to move anyway, but what hastened it was me and
my brother burned down the house,'' Anderson said. ``We were
jumping up and down on the couch with candles, and my brother fell
behind the couch, rolled and hit a curtain (with the candle).
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember pushing the couch. I had my body wedged between the
wall and the couch, pushing with tears in my eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   He got his brother out.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Anderson is playing superhero, or at least Super
Back, for the Falcons, who will try to improve on a 6-2 record, the
best in their 33-year history, at New England on Sunday .
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is burning up the NFL with 862 yards, more than every
back except Terrell Davis (1,150) and Barry Sanders (872). He is
averaging 4.6 yards per carry, has scored six touchdowns, has
rushed for more than 100 yards in five of the past six games _
doubling the number of 100-yard games in the first four years of
his career _ and has caught 16 passes for 215 yards and a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   His seven scores are tied for second in the NFC, fourth in the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, 26, isn't just playing at a Pro Bowl level. If the
voting were today, he'd be a top-five candidate for NFL MVP.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, he rushed for a career-high 172 yards and two
touchdowns and caught two passes for 31 yards and a touchdown in a
37-15 victory against the Rams, earning honors as NFC offensive
player of the week
</P>
<P>
   This week, he's been featured on HBO, ESPN and FOX.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons media-relations employees say it is the most attention
any Atlanta player has received since 1992, when cornerback Deion
Sanders was practicing in pads by day and helicoptering to Braves
playoff games by night.
</P>
<P>
   None of the sudden celebrity, or the Falcons' sudden success,
surprises Anderson. He is caught off guard only by failure, whether
his or his team's.
</P>
<P>
   It has been that way since he was young and his father worked
security for Muhammad Ali, singer Donna Summers and other stars. It
wasn't uncommon for such celebrities as boxer Sugar Ray Leonard to
attend his youth games or for former Lakers guard Byron Scott to
cut his hair.
</P>
<P>
   His father is chief of security for Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom says (that),when I was 3 or 4 years old, I used to
watch the old NFL films,'' he said. ``From watching all those films
and being around all those celebrities, I learned that if you're
going to play, you've got to be the best. Always be No. 1 -- win,
win, win. And the competition among my (four) brothers and (three)
sisters was fierce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember they said, '(Sugar) Ray is coming to your (Pop
Warner football) game,' and I was like, 'Cool. I'll have to score a
couple touchdowns.' And then when I didn't score a touchdown, I
cried. We won, but I was furious I didn't score.''
</P>
<P>
   It an ego thing.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was a seventh-round draft choice from Utah in 1994, the
24th running back selected. He took one look at the depth chart on
a bulletin board as a rookie and drew an arrow moving his name from
fourth to first.
</P>
<P>
   That season, he had two carries, and lost 1 yard. In '95, he had
39 carries for 161 yards and one touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   But in '96, while Atlanta was on its way to a 3-13 record,
running back Craig Heyward wasn't getting the job done, and
Anderson got his chances.
</P>
<P>
   He rushed 232 times for 1,055 yards (4.5-yard average) and five
touchdowns. Last year, a badly sprained ankle held him under 300
yards through seven games, but he rushed 290 times for 1,002 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of the team, he excelled in the second half of the
season, when the Falcons went 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   The improvement has continued this year, with games of 123, 117,
110, 132 and 172 yards, and the two longest runs of Anderson's
career, 48 and 42 yards. Only one of the 23 running backs drafted
ahead of him, the Colts' Marshall Faulk, has more combined rushing
and receiving yards for his career.
</P>
<P>
   One of the keys has been getting used to running behind fullback
Bob Christian (5-11, 230), who often goes through holes first.
</P>
<P>
   He's learned to see like Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think both of us have a much better feel for each other,''
Christian said. ``He can anticipate which way I'm going to block. I
can anticipate where he's going to cut, and I'll block in a way to
. . . give him the best hole.''
</P>
<P>
   The offensive line also has been solid in the running game.
</P>
<P>
   But Anderson has made the most changes. He is much quicker
picking his running lanes. He's not as indecisive as before.
</P>
<P>
   And when Anderson, a stocky man with legs strong enough to squat
670 pounds, wants to run somewhere, stopping him isdifficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has tremendous power,'' Falcons coach Dan Reeves said.
``He's a hard guy to tackle because he doesn't give you much of a
target to hit. All you see is helmet, shoulder pads and knees, and
those things are no fun to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the success is surprising to Anderson, including the
team's 6-2 start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am an eternal optimist,'' he said. ``My expectations of
Jamal are to be at the top. People laughed when I said this team
was going to win 10 games. I fully expect to win 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's school, sports, speeches, whatever, I want
everybody to come away thinking, 'He's good.' If I'm giving a
commencement address at a high school, I want people to walk away
saying, 'He must do this for a living.' That's how I approach
everything.''

 &HT;    Tway shoots a cool 66
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASELTON, Ga. _ In chilly, damp weather more typical of a
European Tour event in the British Isles, American Bob Tway adapted
nicely Thursday in the first round of the Subaru Sarazen World
Open.
</P>
<P>
   After baking in equally unseasonable 80-degree temperatures at
the Tour Championship down the road at East Lake last week, Tway on
Thursday felt the more unpleasant end of the meteorological
spectrum at Chateau Elan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had been like this last week,'' Tway said, ``we might
never have finished.''
</P>
<P>
   On a day when the mercury barely hit 50, Tway's impressive
number at the Legends Course was a 6-under-par 66. Good enough for
first-day honors in the $2 million tournament featuring open
champions from 29 countries, it led English-born, Las Vegas
resident Edward Fryatt (67) by one stroke and built a two-shot edge
over 68s by Germany's Bernhard Langer and New Zealand's Greg
Turner.
</P>
<P>
   American Brad Faxon, Scotland's Andrew Coltart and Mark McNulty
of Zimbabwe were in a group three shots behind Tway at 69.
Americans John Huston and Craig Stadler, and Ireland's Padraig
Harrington were at 70.
</P>
<P>
   And Coltart, for the record, was just fine with the weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very similar to back home,'' Coltart said, ``but there
would be a biting wind. This is nice. You see all these old buggers
taking a little bit longer to stretch on the range in the morning,
you know you've got an advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Tway, who tied for eighth at the Tour Championship, could have
imagined himself back home in Oklahoma, where the weather
frequently changes this quickly. Finishing like a man with plenty
of feel in his fingers, Tway birdied 15, 16 and 17. But then again,
after East Lake, this is a mental vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week, if you relaxed once, you hit in the rough and made
bogey,'' said Tway, who received a late Squire's Selection into the
Sarazen. ``This is a little bit more relaxed, but it would be a
great tournament to win, so you still have to grind it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Langer played without a practice round, having just arrived
Wednesday from Europe, but said, ``My caddie worked out the
yardages yesterday and pointed me in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Faxon, who is staying with buddy Billy Andrade and carpooling
with him to the tournament from Brookhaven, also birdied three of
the last four holes. After finishing 74th on the PGA Tour money
list this year during a season of personal conflicts, failing to
make the Tour Championship, Faxon merely enjoyed a return to the
competitive mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a horrible tournament to watch and not play in,'' Faxon
said of the Tour Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Smyrna's Stewart Cink opened with a par 72, two shots better
than Andrade. Defending champion Mark Calcavecchia also shot a 72.
In a tighter spot was two-time champion Frank Nobilo of New Zealand
at 76.
</P>
<P>
   American Scott Hoch, distressed with his game and not thrilled
with the weather, withdrew after his 74.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to get out of here,'' Hoch said, ``before I make an ass
of myself.

 &HT;    That wreck at AMS changed my life
 &HT;    By Steve Park
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steve Park, who drives the No. 1 car for Dale Earnhardt Inc.,
was seriously injured at Atlanta Motor Speedway in March while
qualifying for the PrimeStar 500. In a special column for the AJC,
Park discusses the fast track at AMS, the wreck and its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ hen you hit the wall at Atlanta Motor Speedway at
almost 200 mph, you aren't going to remember much. That's probably
a good thing. Most times you get lucky and only have the breath
knocked out of you or a pretty good headache. But I wasn't so
lucky. The wreck in March changed my life.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. Atlanta is probably just as safe as any
other track. And I really like Atlanta. I finished 15th there last
year when our team was just getting started and ran a few selected
races in preparation for my rookie year in 1998. But fond memories
of Atlanta faded quickly on March 6.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday morning, we were one of the quickest in the first few
minutes of practice. I remember thinking we really had a chance to
win the pole. We started doing qualifying runs just to be sure the
car was fast enough for a top-five or to sit on the first row. It
was just a routine day. As I was coming through turn four,
something broke on the right front of my Pennzoil Monte Carlo and
made it do a hard right into the retaining wall. I've seen the
video about 50 million times. The car bounces off the fourth-turn
wall, then slides down the front stretch into that wall before
hooking left, cutting across the grass and hitting the pit wall
head-on. It hurts each time I watch it.
</P>
<P>
   I remember waking up in the car with all the safety workers
staring at me. As a race-car driver, your first thought is to hop
out and figure how to fix the car. But it didn't take long to
realize I wasn't going to hop out on this day or any other for the
next several months.
</P>
<P>
   It's safe to say that I broke my leg hitting the wall, and
during one of the three other hits the microphone in my helmet
chipped a couple of front teeth. That's because I banged the
steering wheel pretty hard with my helmet. That joyride also
fractured my right shoulder blade and my left collarbone. In about
three seconds, I went from being one of the best-conditioned
drivers to almost an invalid.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeons at Georgia Baptist took care of me, repairing the
leg and other injuries. An air ambulance flew me back to Charlotte
a few days later. That began about five months of rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   The mental aspect of the recovery was difficult. At times you
felt like the whole racing community had forgotten you. Then the
mailman brings in boxes of letters, some of them describing some
horrific injury or problems they suffered, and I realized mine
weren't so bad after all.
</P>
<P>
   I returned to racing on Aug. 1 at Indianapolis, and it was like
riding a bike again.
</P>
<P>
   You probably wonder why someone who went through all that would
want to go racing at Atlanta again. It's hard to answer. I think
what happened was a freaky thing that won't happen again. Accidents
and injuries are part of the sport. My injury was one of the worst
in the past few years, yet I bounced back pretty quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Racing is what I love to do most in life. Our cars are pretty
safe. Like I said, the worst feeling I've had in the past months is
sitting at home. So getting back and competing has been good for
me.
</P>
<P>
   I have a saying taped to my locker on our truck. It says, ``That
which we persist in doing becomes easier to do, not because the
nature of the task has changed, but our ability to do has
increased.''
</P>
<P>
   I hope that holds true at Atlanta this weekend.

UCLA HESITANT OF TURF WAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's not the elements that worry UCLA. It's the
carpet.
</P>
<P>
   The aging AstroTurf at Oregon State's Parker Stadium may disrupt
the Bruins more than driving rain and 45-degree temperatures
Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   They have not played on artificial turf this season. OSU's
15-year-old carpet is considered the worst in the Pacific-10 _ a
thin, green layer of plastic sitting on cement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very slick,'' said UCLA defensive coordinator Nick
Aliotti, who visited Parker Stadium several times as an Oregon
assistant from 1988-94. ``It's a fast turf. It's shiny, and the
rain stays on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The turf is so bad, even the Beavers dread it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we do,'' coach Mike Riley said. ``We don't practice on
it much. It has to be changed.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be. The Beavers are replacing the carpet with natural
grass after the season.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA coach Bob Toledo is concerned about knee and ankle
injuries, but he said tailback DeShaun Foster, recovering from a
sprained knee, will play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some guys more vulnerable to injury,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   BCS note of the week: UCLA's power rating may not suffer this
weekend despite Oregon State's ranking (45th) in the USA
Today/Sagarin ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State plays No. 42 Michigan State. Kansas State faces No.
43 Baylor, and Tennessee plays No. 124 Alabama-Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   It may be Parent's Weekend at some schools, but it's Patsy
Weekend at the top of the BCS poll.
</P>
<P>
   Review of the Week: All-America offensive tackle Kris Farris is
a film buff who wants to make movies when his career ends. He has
agreed to review a movie each week for the Daily News. This week:
``American History X.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Edward Norton's Oscar-caliber turn as the hateful leader of a
white supremacy cult makes `American History X' a powerful and
intense film. Norton's screen presence is terrifying, and the large
white swastika tattooed on his chest sends chills up your spine.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what makes the film special is that director Tony Kaye
lets the audience into the mind of an extreme racist. Because of
this, countless scenes are nearly impossible to sit through.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ensemble cast provides solid performances. The editing and
cinematography are top-notch. While the film is hard to digest _
you'll leave the theatre disturbed _ `American History X' is an
outstanding cinematic achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 3{ pancakes (out of four).
</P>
<P>
   Lineup update: True freshman Julius Williams and walk-on Mark
Reynosa, a Sylmar native, will return kickoffs. Williams replaces
Ryan Roques, the starting cornerback and No.1 punt returner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roques is on the field more than anybody we have,'' Toledo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Mike Wiley (ankle) will not make the trip, but
linebacker Ramogi Huma is healthier than he's been in weeks.
Reserve offensive lineman Josh Webb (sprained shoulder) will travel
for depth purposes.

 &HT;    Stalking the big buck with bow and arrow
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sun is barely peeking over the pine trees as we trudge to
the pasture at the end of Worth Jacobs Road, in the woods outside
Woden. It's Sunday morning. The time fell back an hour last
weekend, which means we're up at 6 a.m. to get to the deer stand
before daylight. I don't do 6 a.m. on Sunday real well.
</P>
<P>
   We're all dressed in camouflage _ my brother, his eight-year-old
son and me. My brother, the only real hunter among us, has a hat
with camouflage netting to cover his face, camo gloves, and a buck
caller around his neck. He's carrying his bow and arrows.
</P>
<P>
   I'm carrying a lawn chair, a book and a camera.
</P>
<P>
   I don't hunt anymore. I never did hunt much, tagged along at
times for the heck of it with friends who are into this national
pastime of East Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, I shot at a squirrel and luckily missed, while
hunting in Mount Enterprise. Last time I went deer hunting, about
12 years ago, I had a clear shot at a modest-sized buck on some
land I leased in San Augustine, but held off when I started
thinking about field dressing the deer and then having to actually
eat the venison to keep from feeling guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, I have eaten all manner of wild things: deer,
squirrel, raccoon, quail, dove, alligator, rattlesnake and even
possum. Don't ever eat possum. Eat your boot first. It will be
easier on the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   It took a long time for me to conclude that the only reason I
was eating meat you can't buy at the grocery store was because of
peer pressure. ``Go on,'' someone would say. ``Try some of this
barbecued 'coon. It's some good eating.''
</P>
<P>
   And I would do it, scarf down some mystery meat slopped over
with a sauce to disguise the fact it didn't hold a candle to a pork
rib or a cut of filet mignon. Soon my stomach would be singing
arias of complaint. Especially with that possum. Let me reiterate.
Don't ever eat possum.
</P>
<P>
   So I quit hunting. I have nothing against it. Without deer
hunters, whitetails around here would be as plentiful as squirrels.
Deer hang around my yard out here in the semi-country all the time.
Closest I came to killing a deer in my life was a year or so ago
when one ran out in front of my golf cart as I was careening down a
hill. I missed it by maybe two feet. Lucky I did, since I didn't
have a hunting license.
</P>
<P>
   My brother, a big-city boy now, loves this stuff. It's the
ex-Marine in him. So I took him out on a morning when normal people
are sleeping, to try to bag Bambi with a bow, this being archery
season. My job is simple. Drive out to my wife's family farm, down
the road named after my father-in-law, set my brother up on a piece
of ground filled with deer tracks, then read my book, drink coffee,
and keep my nephew quiet while his dad chases the big
</P>
<P>
   buck. Or doe. He's not picky. You can't be picky when hunting
with a bow.
</P>
<P>
   Greg is actually quite good at shooting the bow. We practice in
my yard the night before. He yanks back the 55-lb bow-string with
little effort and lets fly with an arrow that hits in the kill zone
from 20 yards away, time and again. I try and can't get the blamed
string back. He has to help me. The arrow lets fly and buries
itself in the grass about five yards in front of the target. It
takes us about 10 minutes to find it in the dark. That is my
</P>
<P>
   only attempt at archery. Give me a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Next morning, it's quite pleasant out in the pasture _ quiet,
cold, the coffee tasting wonderful, the ragweed redolent in the
fall air. I'm warm enough in my camo regalia and contented to read
a James Carlos Blake novel, while my nephew excitedly watches his
dad carefully stalking a deer, blowing his Big Buck Caller, which
sounds more like a bawling heifer to me.
</P>
<P>
   I guess he's stalking a deer. I never see anything save a few
buzzards and a half-dozen squirrels. A few hours into the hunt, I
hear an arrow fly.
</P>
<P>
   He comes back a few minutes later and says he missed a shot at a
spike buck. Couldn't get the bowstring back quickly enough. I'm
not-so-secretly relieved. The notion of chasing down a deer with an
arrow in its side, gutting it if we ever actually find it, and then
hauling it to the meat processor doesn't appeal to me. I can see
this turning into an all-day project. Then I'm stuck eating deer
sausage for six months. Gotta eat what you kill.
</P>
<P>
   Let's go eat breakfast, I suggest. His son, being eight, is
ready for some pancakes and bacon. So am I. We leave and tromp into
Denny's, still in camo outfits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Been deer hunting?'' the waitress asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yup,'' I say. ``Nearly got one, too.''

 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE and MELINDA HENNEBERGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A struggle for control of the House is under way,
with Rep. Robert Livingston conducting a telephone campaign that
could lead to him running against Newt Gingrich as speaker. But
Gingrich's counter-campaign has given some members pause about
ousting him.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a small band of Republicans vowed on Thursday
that they would not vote to re-elect Gingrich under any
circumstances, a move that, because of the Republicans' shrunken
House majority, could tie the party in knots for months.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., said: ``I personally have made the
decision that I cannot vote for Newt Gingrich for speaker in
January, and there are six others who have told me they feel the
same way, seven people who just will not, and it takes six to
deadlock the vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Fury at the speaker has boiled over since Tuesday's elections,
when Republicans suffered a net loss of five seats in the House.
They blamed Gingrich, the party's chief strategist. But many were
already angry at him for what they said was his failure to
articulate a clear message for the party going into the elections
and for a messy budget process that gave President Clinton a
political edge and contradicted Republican principles of fiscal
conservativism by containing massive amounts of spending for local
projects.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans are to meet Nov. 18 to vote by secret ballot
for their leaders. Whoever wins the Republican nomination for
speaker must stand for election by the full House in January. Even
if Gingrich wins the secret ballot, he could be denied re-election
as speaker in January if Salmon and at least five others refuse to
vote for him. Because the Republicans now control the House by only
12 seats, it would take just six votes against Gingrich to deny him
a majority.
</P>
<P>
   With such a chaotic and unacceptable prospect looming,
Livingston told Gingrich that he should step aside for the good of
the party, Republican officials said. The officials said that
Livingston spoke to Gingrich shortly after the election returns but
also before the election, reflecting Livingston's earlier
displeasure with the speaker over the budget process.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans said that both Livingston, the chairman of
the Appropriations Committee and one of the few members with the
stature to stand for speaker, and Gingrich were working the phones
on Thursday in a struggle for votes. Livingston has said nothing
publicly about a challenge to Gingrich, but several members and
aides said on Thursday that he would announce his intentions,
possibly as soon as Friday, only after he had determined if he
could win.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., was one of several members who spoke
with Livingston on Thursday. ``He told me he's making a number of
phone calls, that he's gotten a very positive response about
running for speaker, and he'll decide within the next 48 hours,''
King said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't do it till he has his ducks in a row, and right now a
lot of people are still loyal to the speaker,'' said an aide to a
Republican who, like many others, is trying to straddle the line
between fealty to a speaker who may retain power and encouragement
to a challenger who offers a salve to an embattled party.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans immediately blamed Gingrich for the party's
losses on Tuesday. Talk quickly emerged the next day of a slate of
candidates to oppose Gingrich and his lieutenants. The list of
possible candidates for leadership positions included Rep.e Steve
Largent of Oklahoma, who talked with Livingston on Thursday about
challenging Gingrich, Republican officials said, speaking on the
condition that their names not be reported.
</P>
<P>
   Those officials said that Largent told Livingston that he wanted
to run with him on a ticket and that he would challenge Rep. Dick
Armey, the majority leader. But, these officials said that if
Livingston did not challenge Gingrich, Largent would run for
speaker instead.
</P>
<P>
   Other names were floated Wednesday for leadership posts. They
included Reps. David McIntosh of Indiana for speaker and Jennifer
Dunn of Washington as conference chairman. Added to the mix on
Thursday was the name of Rep. Christopher Cox, a California
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   As a sign of the uncertainty prevailing among House members on
Thursday, Rep. Henry Hyde, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee
and one of the House's most venerable members, rebuffed a chance to
endorse Gingrich as speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said that Gingrich bore responsibility for the party's
losses Tuesday. ``Leadership takes credit when things go right,''
he said. ``They ought to take the blame when things go wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Gingrich should remain speaker, Hyde said: ``I rather
think he will, but that remains to be seen.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The energy that many vented publicly on Wednesday as anger
toward Gingrich seemed devoted on Thursday to intense internal
political calculations about whether Livingston could succeed in
toppling Gingrich and whether he should succeed.
</P>
<P>
   While many support him as a veteran who understands the House
and has shown shrewd political skills in managing the massive
federal budget, others are reviving images of the Louisianan as a
hot-head who gave the party a bad name during the government
shutdown two years ago and who tends toward arm-flailing in heated
moments.
</P>
<P>
   One conservative leader said that he and his allies had
reservations about Livingston because he was ``obsessed'' about
trying to keep social issues out of the budget process. The budget,
he said, ``has been a vehicle for conservatives over the years to
add restrictions on federal money for abortion and other things you
can't get through the Senate or past a presidential veto. If
Livingston is the challenger, I doubt that will cause a rallying of
the real conservatives in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Some moderates said they were prepared to support him. Rep.
Marge Roukema, R-N.J., said, ``I would be amenable to Livingston.''
Still, she cautioned, ``I'm not after Newt. But it's wrong not to
sit down and seriously look at our options.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Johnson, an aide to Rep. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin, R-La., said
that his boss was ``emblematic'' of the confusion among the broad
base of House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy has been loyal to both Speaker Gingrich and Dick Armey,
and he's still loyal to them, but he also wants to hear what they
have to say before committing to them in the next election,''
Johnson said. ``Everyone is asking the same question: Can we
refocus the message and re-energize our base without re-aligning
the leadership?''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon said his refusal to support Gingrich no matter what was
based on Gingrich's track record of ``one failed strategy after
another,'' including the impeachment process and the pork-laden
budget.
</P>
<P>
   With the challenge under way, Gingrich has been trying to show
members that he is responsive to their concerns. After an election
night in which he portrayed the Republicans as victorious even as
they lost seats, the next day he took ``responsibility'' for the
losses. In another move, Gingrich has indicated that he is willing
to cede control over the party's congressional campaign committee,
allowing the whole House to select its members.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich is also making strong personal appeals to Republicans.
Said one top House aide: ``He'll get support. How much? Only his
own vote-counters know.''

 &HT;    Willie Nelson: The original 'Comeback Kid'
 &HT;    By Jay Milner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Willie Nelson's songs, at least with him singing them, may not
be heard on today's country radio stations like they once were, but
Willie is experiencing another one of his famous comebacks. He's
had enough to rank him right up there with our reckless young
president as the ``Comeback Kid.''
</P>
<P>
   This time around Willie is being honored at the Kennedy Center
in our nation's capitol for his lifetime contribution to national
culture, or something along that line of thinking. Fellow honorees
that night at the Kennedy Center include Bill Cosby, Andre Preven,
and a couple of other big timers whose names don't come up on my
mental Rolodex at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   And there's another book about Willie and his music just
released by Austin's Eakin Press, a big paperback with 472 pages
including a complete index. This one is by a fellow named Steven
Opdyke who lives in Florida where he's worked in various capacities
in the record business and put together a book about all the books
about Elvis Presley.
</P>
<P>
   This Willie book is titled simply ``Willie Nelson Sings
America.'' It was introduced in August in Carthage, Texas, during
the inauguration of the brand new Texas Country Music Hall of Fame
where Willie along with Tex Ritter, Jim Reeves, Roy Rogers, Gene
Autry, Cindy Walker and Joe Allison were the initial inductees.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Opdyke discusses several puzzles of current radio
programing, particularly the fact that it's almost impossible these
days, or nights, to hear a song by Willie, Waylon, George Jones,
Merle Haggard or anybody else in the business over 45 years of age.
It's especially puzzling since just about every one of today's
``hot'' country stars are wimpy imitations of one of the old
timers, wearing a hat, with a couple of shirt buttons unbuttoned.
Why in the world, some of us feel compelled to ask, don't they play
the
</P>
<P>
   originals instead of the imitators?
</P>
<P>
   Willie, Waylon, George Jones, Jerry Jeff Walker and others over
45 years of age still draw large crowds where ever they perform,
but those who program today's radio stations seem to have been born
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Willie is quoted in the book as saying he knew ``that radio-wise
I was getting into a little bit of trouble when I heard some guy
say, 'Boy, I wish they'd play some of those old guys again like
George Strait and Randy Travis.'''
</P>
<P>
   Opdyke also quotes Willie as saying to a reporter from Scene
magazine in 1997 that gaining radio air play had: ``gotten so
political that in order to fight that battle you've got to attack
it from a higher spot than where I am. You gotta go up there to
those guys that program a hundred radio stations.''
</P>
<P>
   For those of us who have been wondering why local radio stations
everywhere play the same records in the same order, day in and day
out, that's the answer: They are all being programmed by people in
some offices somewhere else, probably on the East or West coasts.
Which brings forth the question: Why can't stations program their
own music according to the tastes of their
</P>
<P>
   local listeners? Who knows the answer. It probably has something
to do with money and the lack of the ability to reason.
</P>
<P>
   Opdyke's book on Willie talks about much more than the stupidity
of current country radio programing, however. An enormous amount of
research has gone into this work. Opdyke outlines, with quotes from
Willie and his associates down through the decades, every album
Willie has made, since way back in his
</P>
<P>
   Nashville days through his recent fascinating efforts in his own
Austin studio and in studios as far away as Europe and the British
Isles.
</P>
<P>
   Also discussed are his albums and special guest appearances with
such brilliant peers as Ray Charles, Bill Monroe, Johnny Cash and
Kris Kristofferson, as well as his more famous collaborations with
Waylon Jennings.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if you are interested in Willie Nelson's
professional life and his songs, this is a book for your personal
library.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't find a copy at your local bookstore, it may be
ordered from Eakin Press, P.O. Box 90159, Austin, Texas.

JUMPERS, AERIALISTS AND ARTISTS TO THE HILT 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two hundred horses, artists all, and from all points
of the globe, transformed midtown Manhattan into an international
equine wonderland Thursday night as the 115th National Horse Show
got under way at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   There were German, French, Dutch, and even Argentine-bred grand
prix jumpers, the horse show world's version of aerialists, and
there were five-gaited saddlebreds, homegrown in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibitions featured the trick horses of the charro champion
Jerry Diaz, who surrounds himself and his palomino with a spinning
lariat, as well as a balletic dressage demonstration by the
four-time United States Olympian Robert Dover and Anky van Grunsven
of the Netherlands, whose bay horse, Bonfire, is the Michael Jordan
of this sport.
</P>
<P>
   Summoned to the show ring by the traditional call of the
coaching horn, the horses, if not the spectators, arrived on time
and immediately got down to business in a speed stake, the $10,000
Etienne Aigner Horseshoe Classic.
</P>
<P>
   The course required a dozen jumping efforts by its 18
competitors, including the teams from the United States, France and
Canada, which sent its first all-female riding squad to the
National and which will compete Friday night in the Nations Cup.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, three riders from the American team, led by the
veteran Leslie Burr Howard, occupied the first three spots on the
leader board Thursday night. But when Patrice Delaveau and
Aurnella, representing the French team, flashed through the course
in 45.65 seconds without nicking a jump, the male rider on the
10-year-old French-bred mare moved into the first position and held
it.
</P>
<P>
   Howard, riding Jane Clark's French-bred mare, Ulane de Plessix,
took second place with a brisk and unflawed 46.83-second trip round
the course. Howard was a member of the United States equestrian
squad that won a team gold medal at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics
and a team silver in 1996 in Atlanta; this year she already has
nine grand prix victories, and she is in such demand that she is
commuting this week between the National and the Royal Agricultural
Winter Fair in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Third place went to the American squad's Eric Hasbrouck on Miss
Flo, the only Argentina-bred equine in the class; their clean ride
was timed in 48.62 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The Garden and Canadian team debut of 17-year-old Frankie
Chesler, the youngest rider ever to represent Canada, did not go as
smoothly as the teen-ager had hoped. She came in last in the field
on Virtual Village Elton III, with five knockdowns and a time of
118.09 seconds. Gail Greenough, the Canadian chef d'equipe,
attributed Chesler's opening night woes to an overdose of
adrenaline and an unruly horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``She'd never ridden the horse in competition before, and though
I told her to slow things down in her mind when she visualized the
course, once she got out there, she put it in fast forward,'' said
Greenough. ``But that can happen here on your first time out. It's
New York, it's the Garden, it's impressive, and you want to go for
broke.''
</P>
<P>
   Chesler, who was born in Miami but lives in Orangeville,
Ontario, with her string of seven jumpers, earned her place on the
Canadian team with a stellar 1998 campaign that has put her in
third place in the World Cup standing among Canadian riders.
</P>
<P>
   Last year she won the individual and team silver at the North
American Young Riders Championship with Braveheart, a black
quarterhorse that survived a bout with cancer in 1996. Two weeks
ago at the Washington International, Chesler finished second in the
$25,000 International Open Jumper class aboard Ravenna Z, her
favorite horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to have my own horse business, do the Olympics and win
a gold medal, and next year I want to ride in the Pan American
games, that's my biggest goal for now,'' said Chesler, who elected
to represent Canada rather than the United States because she
suspected, accurately as it turned out, that she had a better
chance of making the Canadian team in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the U.S., there are too many older riders just as good as
or better than me who've been waiting for a spot on the team, so it
wouldn't have been fair for them to pick me. And here I am already
on the Canadian team. It's a big honor.''
</P>
<P>
   The dressage specialist van Grunsven, a three-time World Cup
Final champion who won double silver at the Atlanta Olympics,
waltzed through her musical ride on 15-year-old Bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that Anky is the state of the art of our sport,''
said Dover, the United States dressage champion. ``And Bonfire is
the same way: he's so far advanced beyond most of the other
animals. He just has this incredible desire to get it right.''

CONE SAYS HE'S TRYING TO REMAIN A YANKEE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Cone said he would have preferred to be talking
about Lou Gehrig's disease. And Thursday night, he was on his way
to fulfill a decade-old promise to a Long Island Little League
organization.
</P>
<P>
   But Cone knew the question on everyone's mind during a busy day
of appearances Thursday. And that was simply this: Was he going to
re-sign with the Yankees or go elsewhere?
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, my preference is to stay,'' Cone said Thursday at a
midtown fund-raiser for the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
Association. ``There is no place I'd rather play. We've extended
the deadline twice. I'm hopeful we'll be able to get this done. And
hopefully, I'll end my career right here.''
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old right-hander, who won 20 games for the World
Series champions this past season, said he was ``bending over
backwards'' to try to get something done that would keep him a
Yankee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked about restructuring the set-up of a deal with no
incentives kicking in,'' Cone said. ``We've talked about one year
and we've talked about two years. But we really haven't gotten into
depth. It's not really the money. It's more the structure of the
deal. Whether it's for one year or two, whether there's an option,
and how the option kicks in.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, for the second time in the last week, Cone and the
Yankees agreed to extend the deadline hanging over his head. So
Cone now has until next Wednesday to again decide whether to accept
a $5.5 million contract option for 1999, or to see if he and the
Yankees can agree on a more attractive deal by then.
</P>
<P>
   Cone qualified for the 1999 option by pitching more than 200
innings last season. And if Cone were to accept the 1999 option, he
would also have a $5.5 million option for the year 2000 _ if he
pitches 192 1/3 innings in 1999. But that, said the pitcher who has
undergone arm surgery twice in the last three years, is actually an
incentive he could do without.
</P>
<P>
   For Cone, it was a way of acknowledging that after all the
mileage he has put on his pitching arm and all the durability he
has displayed in the last dozen years in the majors, he cannot be
quite sure how many innings a game he could pitch in the future.
And while he continued to negotiate with the Yankees, he also filed
Thursday for a provisional free agency, which he will only exercise
if he and the Yankees ultimately cannot agree on a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Cone is believed to be asking the Yankees for $16 million over
two guaranteed years, a figure his agent, Steve Fehr, would neither
confirm nor deny Thursday. The Yankees are believed to be more
inclined to offer one year at $7 million because of the questions
they have about how much Cone has left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may just talk about one year,'' Cone said. ``But I'd like
two or three years. And I'd like to get rid of the 200-innings
deal. I don't want it to become an issue again. If I need to miss a
start in September, I'd like to go ahead and be able to do it. Last
year, I was in a position to win 20 games. But I was also looking
at 200 innings. And it was certainly in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How much I have left is a valid question,'' added Cone, who
will turn 36 in January. ``But I'd like to think that I can pitch a
couple, maybe even three, more years.''
</P>
<P>
   And if not with the Yankees, then perhaps somewhere else. An
interesting development could occur if the Mets ever show interest.
As for now, both of the Mets' owners _ Fred Wilpon and Nelson
Doubleday _ have indicated an unwillingness to bid for Cone or
Bernie Williams, the Yankees' free-agent center fielder, apparently
because they do not want to start a war with the Yankees' owner,
George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   But Cone wants to remain in New York. And friends of Cone's have
said in the past that he would not be against re-signing with the
Mets, the team on which he first emerged as a major league star.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the winter of 1987, after Cone's 5-6 rookie season
with the Mets, that he appeared at a banquet for the Rockville
Centre Little League and took a $1,000 appearance fee _ ``I needed
the money,'' Cone said with a smile _ promising that if he ever
became a star he would appear at another of the league's banquets
for free. And so, 11 years later, that was what Cone was preparing
to do Thursday night, unbeknownst to the Little Leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he could not resist responding to his rambunctious
teammate, David Wells, who joked the other day that Cone might find
himself missing a couple of teeth if he does not re-sign with the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably will take a shot at me,'' Cone said of Wells.
``But I did my part to keep him out of jail all year. I think
that's the main reason the Yankees want to bring me back.''

 By ETHAN BRONNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHLEHEM, Penn. _ John Updike has lived in Massachusetts so
long _ more than four decades _ that it is hard to remember he was
born and raised in eastern Pennsylvania. This area is, he says,
still his emotional and literary home, the setting of his four
``Rabbit'' books and the yeasty source of much of his keen
observation of the American middle class.
</P>
<P>
   As he once wrote of Shillington, the farm town 30 miles
southwest of here where he spent his early years, ``I love
Shillington not as one loves Capri or New York, because they are
special, but as one loves one's own body and consciousness, because
they are synonymous with being.''
</P>
<P>
   Updike was back for a two-day visit this week to read from his
work at Lehigh University here and speak to a class studying his
work. It was a visit filled with the poignancy and irony that
permeate his writing, at once a victory lap for an esteemed man of
letters and an encounter with a generation that does not tend to
view high-minded writers as cultural heroes.
</P>
<P>
   He said being back in the area had a slightly unreal quality, as
if time was stretched. He took note of the solid church spires
rising from Bethlehem's russet countryside, the diner where his
sandwich cost $1.75 and the rusting hulks of steel that evoke a
time memorialized in his early novels.
</P>
<P>
   Bethlehem, whose steel works used to employ 30,000, is trying to
turn its old steel mills into a museum of industrial history in
cooperation with the Smithsonian Institution. The changing face of
American industry is not a foreign theme to Updike, whose character
Harry (Rabbit) Angstrom got rich when U.S. car buyers turned
suddenly to Toyotas in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in gray flannel slacks, penny loafers, tweed jacket and
striped tie, Updike, 66, sensed there was something quaint, if not
strange, about his presence at the seminar, attended by a dozen
students. ``I must seem like a dinosaur,'' he said by way of
self-mocking introduction. ``You study it but you don't expect it
to show up in your classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Updike's appearance was especially charged because the title of
the class is, ``Should John Updike Be Awarded the Nobel Prize?''
and the professor, Jack De Bellis, is among the most knowledgeable
and obsessed of Updike's devoted readers (he himself calls it ``my
gentle madness''). ``Jack knows more about me than I know about
myself,'' Updike said with a twinkle, deferring to De Bellis about
a character in an early Updike story.
</P>
<P>
   De Bellis, 63, has published an Updike bibliography _ no mean
feat given the prodigious Updike output of stories, novels, poems,
essays and other writing _ and is completing an 800-page Updike
encyclopedia with plot summaries, descriptions of characters and
personal and historical background.
</P>
<P>
   De Bellis also has one of the world's most extensive collections
of Updikeana, including scores of signed books and a 1968 cover of
Time magazine with a painting of a sandy-haired, turtle-neck-clad
Updike, who had just published the best-selling and then-shocking
novel ``Couples.''
</P>
<P>
   So there the two sat in class, the author and his chronicler, a
Philadelphia native who has spent the last 30 years here, with
their matching mops of unruly hair, finely pointed noses and light
Pennsylvania accents, as Updike defended himself against
accusations from students that the women in his fiction lacked
substance and that he wrote of incest to shock and sell books.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't think women are dumb,'' Updike said, his face
mottling pink over traces of psoriasis, a condition he
painstakingly described in the essay, ``At War With My Skin.''
</P>
<P>
   On incest, he replied: ``All love comes from the family. Yet it
is an effort to break out of the familiar, to become intimate with
another, to reconstruct the cuddling, the tickling and the comfort.
It is part of being human. Eros is everywhere. It is what binds.''
</P>
<P>
   On his hopes and chances for a Nobel Prize, Updike, who has won
nearly every major American literary award, including the Pulitzer,
tried to be dismissive without being disrespectful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some Greek leader was once asked why there was no statue to
him in the town square,'' he told the students. ``He replied that
he would rather people ask why there isn't one than why there is
one.''
</P>
<P>
   But Updike has clearly given the question some thought. His
latest book, ``Bech at Bay,'' his third about Henry Bech, a
Jewish-American writer who serves as a satirical alter ego, ends
with Bech collecting the prize in Stockholm as the surprise winner
from a split Nobel committee. ``I thought that by giving the prize
to Bech I could end the speculation,'' he offered. ``It seems to me
that the Nobel committee is not in search of aging, white Western
men these days.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, Updike gave what he called ``an
all-Pennsylvania reading'' of poems and stories to a packed
audience of several hundred. He selected a story from his previous
Bech book, ``Bech Is Back.''
</P>
<P>
   In it, Bech finds himself in Pennsylvania being paraded around a
small university. While in the area, Bech visits Marvin Federbusch,
a collector of Bech books whose voice and manner seem an odd mirror
of the fictitious author's.
</P>
<P>
   And so the inside laughter rang out as a number of those present
recognized their colleague, De Bellis, as Updike's own Federbusch.
The line was long for those seeking a signature. Most of the
seekers were middle-aged.
</P>
<P>
   For the students, the visit was not like, as Bech had described
in that story, ``a god descending _ whimsical as Zeus, radiant as
Apollo.'' It was interesting, they said, to see the man in the
flesh. But they were not in awe. ``I think what writing was in his
era, television and MTV are to ours,'' said Dennis Zehner, a senior
from nearby Allentown. ``Today, writing is like everything else, a
commodity.''

HYDE OUTLINES DIRECTION OF IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (With BC-CLINTON-IMPEACH-NYT) (af) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Following are excerpts from remarks by Henry Hyde, the
Illinois Republican who is chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, at a news conference about the impeachment hearings: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The election is over, and we must now turn to the unpleasant
duty that the Constitution requires of us. The search for the truth
now must begin without distraction. Many Americans want to know
where we're going, how we will proceed. And so I've called you here
to give you some idea of what we plan to do.
</P>
<P>
   Before I make any specific announcements, let me just say a word
about some general matters. No one knows more than I do that the
public wants us to end this matter as soon as possible. I want to
end this matter as soon as possible. Let me assure you, no one on
the committee enjoys this task. Conducting an inquiry of this
nature is solemn, sober, serious business. There's nothing
enjoyable about it.
</P>
<P>
   There are always appealing voices of convenience and comfort to
call on us to look away. It would be easy. We could just look away
from this awful mess and let it disappear. But our duty demands
that we look further. It requires that we search out the truth,
face it squarely. It insists that we uphold the rule of law. It
demands that we assure that both the president and the average
citizen stand before the bar of justice equally. ...
</P>
<P>
   We believe the most relevant witnesses have already testified at
length about the matters in issue. And in the interest of finishing
our expeditious inquiry, we will not require most of them to come
before us to repeat their testimony. The committee will invite
Judge Starr to appear in public session on Nov. 19. Judge Starr led
the investigation, and we believe his testimony will be helpful to
the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Today I'm sending a letter to the president asking him to admit
or deny certain facts that appear to be established by the record
now before us. No one should take these requests as establishing
our final conclusions. Rather, they will simply help us to
establish what facts are in dispute and what facts are not.
</P>
<P>
   The president is free to dispute, of course, whatever he wants.
But by agreeing to those facts that he does not dispute, he will
allow us to narrow the issues and bring this matter to a close more
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   This is our agenda for the next few weeks. The committee's
activities beyond that time have not been finalized. But I remain
committed to trying to complete this inquiry as expeditiously as
possible and by the end of the year if possible.
</P>
<P>
   Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution provides the House of
Representatives shall have the sole power of impeachment. The House
has directed our committee to begin an inquiry of impeachment of
President Clinton. Implicit in that mandate is the responsibility
to independently investigate and establish all of the relevant
facts.
</P>
<P>
   This took the committee nearly six months in the impeachment
inquiry of President Nixon, 16 months in the impeachment inquiry of
Judge Hastings, and 13 months in the impeachment inquiry of Judge
Walter Nixon. Clearly, to complete the task before us in less than
three months will require the cooperation of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   More important in this process than any schedule is the
preservation of our constitutional system. Our system of government
demands the full cooperation of the executive branch in an
impeachment inquiry. Indeed, the judiciary committee reaffirmed
that principle in its impeachment inquiry of President Nixon in
1974. When the Nixon White House failed to cooperate fully, the
committee approved an article of impeachment against the president
for usurping the authority of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Our firm intention is to resolve this matter with fairness,
honor and expedition. With the president's cooperation, we will
meet our goal of finishing by the end of the year. This, of course,
is up to the president and his advisers. But we intend to continue
as long as it takes to vindicate the rule of law and follow the
truth wherever it leads us.

CALIFORNIA TO TOUGHEN ITS EMISSIONS STANDARDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Despite strong objections from Detroit's Big Three
auto makers, environmental regulators in California voted Thursday
night to require cars, minivans and nearly all sport utility
vehicles and pickup trucks to meet identical and much more
stringent emissions rules.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's vote makes California the first state to impose
car emissions standards on so-called light trucks, a category that
includes sport utility vehicles, minivans and pickup trucks.
Regulated as work vehicles, light trucks have been allowed until
now to emit up to three times as much pollution per mile as cars.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency is working on new emissions
rules that, like the new California regulations, would start with
the 2004 model year.
</P>
<P>
   Auto makers and environmentalists lobbied California regulators
with particular zeal because the EPA is widely expected to follow
the outlines of California's models, although possibly with
slightly higher limits on some emissions because the rest of the
country tends to have cleaner air.
</P>
<P>
   The California Air Resources Board, which regulates the state's
air quality, not only approved a staff proposal for stricter
standards but actually made it even tougher by eliminating a clause
that would have allowed diesel-powered cars and light trucks to
meet less strict rules.
</P>
<P>
   All of Detroit's Big Three and several foreign auto makers are
working on fuel-efficient diesel engines for their sport utility
vehicles and pickup trucks so they can meet federal fuel-economy
regulations while continuing to make these vehicles bigger and
bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Requiring diesel vehicles to meet the same rules as
gasoline-powered vehicles ``makes it extremely difficult to market
a diesel vehicle in California,'' said Richard Varenchik, a
spokesman for the air resources board.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's Big Three auto makers _ the General Motors Corp., the
Ford Motor Co. and the Chrysler Corp. _ had agreed with state
regulators that minivans, midsized sport utility vehicles like the
Jeep Cherokee and midsized pickups like the Ford Ranger should
start to meet car pollution standards.
</P>
<P>
   They objected strongly but unsuccessfully to the California
regulators' decision to apply car pollution standards as well to
full-sized pickup trucks like the Dodge Ram and full-sized sport
utility vehicles like the Cadillac Escalade and Chevrolet Tahoe.
</P>
<P>
   These big vehicles have much larger engines that are designed to
haul heavy loads and pull trailers, and tend to pollute more than
cars.
</P>
<P>
   Auto makers here were dismayed by Thursday night's unanimous
decision by the air board's 11 members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake, this is going to be really difficult,'' said
Sara Tatchio, a spokeswoman for Ford. Full-sized sport utility
vehicles and pickup trucks sold in California may become less
powerful, with less capacity to haul freight or trailers, as a
result of Thursday's decision, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators calculated that the cost of complying with the new
rules would be $96 to $304 for each vehicle, but the auto makers
warned that the cost could be far higher for full-sized sport
utility vehicles and pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The very largest pickup trucks, as well as four-wheel-drive
Chevrolet Suburbans and even bigger sport utility vehicles that
Ford will introduce next year, will qualify for less stringent
rules.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules do not require any further regulatory or
legislative action before taking effect, but could be challenged in
court, although auto makers have historically avoided doing so. It
takes two to five years to make significant alterations in
automobile designs, so auto makers can seldom afford to wait for
the result of a lengthy court battle before beginning to make the
changes.
</P>
<P>
   Thursay's vote will force drastic reductions in pollution from
full-sized sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. The new rules
will require, for example, that cars only emit a quarter of their
current output of nitrogen oxides, which are thought to be an
important contributor to smog. By requiring full-sized sport
utility vehicles and pickup trucks to meet the new car standards,
instead of continuing to be allowed to emit three times as much,
California is asking that nitrogen oxide emissions from these
vehicles be cut to one-twelfth of their current levels.
</P>
<P>
   Cars and light trucks already produce far less pollution per
mile now than they did in the 1950s. But this improvement has been
partly undone because there are more vehicles and they are driven
farther.

AFL-CIO REJECTS ACCORD TO CURTAIL SWEATSHOPS
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO and a large union of department store workers
announced Thursday that they were rejecting an agreement that a
group of apparel manufacturers and human rights groups have reached
to curtail sweatshops.
</P>
<P>
   These two labor groups joined the nation's largest apparel
union, the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees,
which announced on Wednesday that it would no longer participate in
an effort intended to reassure consumers that the apparel they buy
was not made in sweatshops.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement reached by Liz Claiborne, L.L. Bean, Reebok, Nike
and other companies establishes numerous rules for their factories,
including a minimum age for workers, a maximum 60-hour workweek,
and a requirement that companies pay the minimum or prevailing
industry wage in the countries where factories are situated. The
agreement also calls for independent monitors to inspect the
factories.
</P>
<P>
   But the unions rejected the agreement on numerous grounds,
asserting that the monitoring would not be frequent enough and that
the accord did not require apparel companies to pay workers a wage
high enough to meet a family's basic needs. The unions also
criticized the accord for giving companies carte blanche to
manufacture in countries, like China and Indonesia, which repress
trade unions.
</P>
<P>
   John Sweeney, the AFL-CIO's president, issued a statement with
Lenore Miller, president emeritus of the Retail, Wholesale and
Department Store Union, saying that ``despite the seriousness of
these deliberations'' the labor movement ``has concluded that
signing on to an agreement with the participating companies is not
possible at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   After two years of debate, the agreement was reached by members
of the White House Apparel Industry Partnership, a group of 18
apparel companies, labor unions and human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   Roberta Karp, general counsel at Liz Claiborne and co-chairwoman
of the presidential task force, said the effort would move forward
despite the unions' rejection. She said the task force would seek
to enlist other companies and that members would observe the
workplace standards and monitoring rules required by the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This effort will still be successful,'' she said. ``The unions
were part of the deliberations. Their imprimatur is on the code and
the monitoring principles. It really is an enormous step forward.
While it doesn't satisfy on all scores an entire union agenda, it
does satisfy what we set out to do, which is to improve working
conditions around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The apparel workers union has taken a tougher stance toward the
agreement than has the department store union, which suggested it
might someday sign on if it is pleased with how the pact is carried
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labor's job is to push the envelope a little further,'' said
Ms. Miller of the department store workers. ``Of all such
agreements I've seen this is the best of them. In my view, the door
is not closed to labor's participation.''
</P>
<P>
   While the National Consumers League and the Lawyers Committee
for Human Rights helped negotiate the agreement, another task force
member, the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, rejected
the agreement Thursday because it does not contain a requirement to
pay a living wage.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Posner, executive director of the lawyers committee,
said the agreement was an important first step to hold companies
accountable.

POSSIBLE PASSAGE OF TAX LIGHTS FIRE UNDER CIGAR MERCHANTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will alos move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY LEE CONDON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Already, L.A.-area smoke-shop owners are worrying
that Proposition 10, the anti-smoking initiative, could put them
out of business.
</P>
<P>
   But it's still too soon to say whether the statewide measure
will snuff out the growing demand for retail cigars.
</P>
<P>
   Yes votes were a mere 13,205 ahead of No votes Thursday with
more than 7 million counted. State officials estimate that 900,000
absentee ballots remain to be counted and a final result may not be
available for another week, said Beth Miller, a spokeswoman for the
Secretary of State's Office.
</P>
<P>
   But Proposition 10's slim lead is enough to make owners of cigar
parlors glow with worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to put the tobacco stores out of business,'' said
Michele Fenton, owner of the Cigar Den on Ventura Boulevard in
Encino, a Los Angeles suburb. ``Our customers are used to paying $5
a cigar. They'll end up paying $8 a cigar.''
</P>
<P>
   While the price per pack of cigarettes will go up by 50 cents
because of the new tax, the state Board of Equalization has not yet
determined exactly how the new proposition will apply to cigars,
chewing tobacco and other tobacco products. What is known is that
such products will take a much heftier tax hit than cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're looking at twice the increase of tax on cigars, snuff
and chew,'' said David Mancuso, a fiscal and policy analyst with
the state Legislative Analyst's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, under Proposition 99, cigars are taxed at between 35
percent to 45 percent of the wholesale cost. Under the new
initiative, ``I believe you'll get over 100percent,'' Mancuso said.
</P>
<P>
   The new taxes for cigarettes would go into effect Jan. 1, while
the tax on other products would go into effect July 1, Mancuso
said. If Proposition 10 passes, the Board of Equalization will
determine a tax plan for non-cigarette tobaccos by March.
</P>
<P>
   Fenton said she expects many cigar fans will turn to mail-order
services to avoid California's steep tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state of California should monitor these mail-order
businesses. People are going to go outside California to get
tobacco,'' Fenton said.
</P>
<P>
   While some expect a rush on cigarette and cigar purchasing
before Proposition 10 takes effect, Fenton said she doesn't have
any plans to stock up before any new tax is imposed. She has
already suffered a 25 percent drop in business this year that she
attributes to a new state law banning smoking in restaurants and
bars.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Karamian, owner of the Ceegar Gallery and Lounge in
Glendale, said he expects his business will slow because higher
prices will make customers buy fewer cigars.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he does not think people will drop cigars altogether. Unlike
cigarettes, cigars are a luxury item and Karamian said people shop
for cigars like they shop for fine wine. It's for that reason that
he does not think smokers will just start buying cigars in bulk
from mail-order houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want the same cigar all the time. They want
variety,'' Karamian said.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of Proposition 10 say tobacco products would be taxed
to discourage people, especially minors, from smoking and to raise
money for programs for children up to age 3.
</P>
<P>
   But Karamian said he won't even let anyone under 18 in his store
and that the proposition is misguided for including cigars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids don't buy cigars. A child will not go and get drunk on a
bottle of wine. Cigars compare to a bottle of wine,'' Karamian
said.
</P>
<P>
   About half of Karamian's business comes from cigarettes, but he
does not expect a big drop-off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another 50 cents is not going to deter them. People will not
quit because cigarettes are addictive,'' Karamian said.
</P>
<P>
   Neelam Sharma, manager of a Cigarettes Cheaper store in
Chatsworth, an L.A.-area suburb, said her customers think the new
tax is outrageous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a little bit shaky because we could be out of business,
which is just not fair,'' Sharma said. &QL;

EDITORIAL: HELPING MITCH'S VICTIMS

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Nov. 6:
</P>
<P>
   Washington is doing far too little to help Nicaragua and
Honduras deal with one of the worst natural disasters in recent
history. The Clinton administration pledged $70 million Thursday in
food aid and Pentagon help, and U.S. soldiers have rescued 600
people. But Honduras and Nicaragua urgently need helicopters to get
food, safe water and medicine to those stricken by the torrential
rains from Hurricane Mitch. Flooding and mudslides have killed at
least 7,000 people, perhaps double that, in a region just a few
hundred miles from the United States. To prevent more death,
President Clinton needs to galvanize his administration,
coordinating a much larger effort that overcomes bureaucratic
obstacles and gives the desperate people of Central America a level
of assistance that matches their travail.
</P>
<P>
   The need is staggering. The emergency will not subside when the
waters do, as Mitch has destroyed the shelter and sources of food
of millions of people. Once the emergency is over, of course,
billions in international aid will be needed to rebuild and help
farmers plant. Mitch wiped out two-thirds of Honduras' crops and 60
percent of its roads, bridges and buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The most urgent needs are for portable bridges and air
transport. Even towns a short distance from major cities are cut
off by flooding and mud. As of Thursday, the United States had lent
Nicaragua four helicopters, and Mexico has lent two. Four more are
coming, but Nicaragua's ambassador to Washington says that a total
of 20 are desperately needed. There are seven helicopters at U.S.
bases in Panama, and more can be flown by cargo plane from the
United States in a matter of hours. There is no reason to wait.
</P>
<P>
   Disaster relief is often a political event in Latin America.
Nicaragua's dictator Anastasio Somoza was widely accused of
stealing most of the relief money after an earthquake leveled
Managua in 1972. This was a key element in his fall seven years
later. Mexico's difficulties in building houses for those left
homeless by the 1985 Mexico City earthquake left millions
disillusioned with the ruling party. The governments in the region
will lose all popular support if they do not distribute aid fairly
or if much of it disappears.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch will set Central America's development back years, if not
decades. The United States, which spent billions of dollars in the
1980s to finance wars in Central America, now has a responsibility
to help save lives and protect the region's democracies.

EDITORIAL: MR. HYDE'S IMPEACHMENT SCHEDULE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, Nov. 6:
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly Rep. Henry Hyde looked as if he really meant it when he
said he was not enjoying himself. Guiding the impeachment process
is a constitutional duty, Hyde said, but ``I'd like to have it
behind me.'' With that the chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee committed himself to an accelerated timetable for a
committee vote and perhaps even a full House vote on impeachment by
the end of the year. In addition he set plans for calling Kenneth
Starr as the first and perhaps only witness, on Nov. 19. No less
important, he sent the White House a list of 81 questions to be
answered yes or no, giving President Clinton a chance to speed up
the fact-finding process.
</P>
<P>
   Though Hyde understandably denied it, he seemed to realize that
the political landscape had changed as a result of Democratic gains
in the election on Tuesday. The public clearly wants the
impeachment deliberations to be wrapped up in an efficient fashion.
Moreover, with a majority of only 12 seats in the next Congress,
the Republicans may not be able to muster the votes to pass an
impeachment resolution in 1999. As for the current Congress, some
Republican moderates do not want the first order of business after
the election to be a vote on removal of the president.
</P>
<P>
   But the constitutional process has to be reckoned with, as does
the need, as a matter of the rule of law, for Clinton to receive a
formal rebuke for his recklessness and lying. For that reason,
Hyde's course is a sound way to achieve these goals through a
process that meets Clinton's standard of being ``constitutional,
fair and expeditious.'' It will move things along to hear first
from Starr and to let Democrats critical of his prosecutorial
methods and the interpretation he has applied to the evidence have
a chance to question him.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important things that both Democrats and
Republicans need to ask the independent counsel, of course, is
whether he has any additional evidence of possibly impeachable
offenses by the president. These questions need to range not simply
through the Monica Lewinsky matter but through other abuses
investigated by Starr, including Whitewater, the alleged misuse of
FBI files and the dismissal of the White House travel office. Hyde
cannot allow Starr to be coy about these questions. If Starr has
anything, he must deliver on Nov. 19.
</P>
<P>
   We are not prepared to accept the idea at this point that Starr
must be the only witness called before the Judiciary Committee. But
once he testifies, the committee can make an informed decision, in
public view, as to whether more witnesses are needed. As for the
questions sent by Hyde to the White House, it may be in Clinton's
interest to answer some of them to expedite the process. Some he
will dodge for obvious legal reasons, including the one asking him
to ``admit or deny that you gave false testimony under oath'' in
the Paula Jones case. Sooner or later the president will have to
own up to that as part of any negotiated settlement. For now,
however, there are less momentous questions that can be answered
without jeopardizing the president's ability to defend himself or
to enter into settlement negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde continues to insist that the Constitution leaves no room
for a censure or other action short of impeachment. He ignores the
fact that the impeachment process is a legislative and political
step rather than a judicial and legal one. The House can set the
rules. It can censure Clinton if it wants and offer the president
demanding terms for such a censure. In the election, the public
signaled that it is ready for such an approach. We believe that
barring new evidence of other wrongdoing by Clinton, Hyde will come
around to guiding the Judiciary Committee in that direction.

TRACING THE PATH OF A HARD-LINE ABORTION FOE 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In July 1988, when Randall Terry drove through the
night from his home in Binghamton, N.Y., to Atlanta to start the
series of anti-abortion protests that would finally put his new
hard-line group, Operation Rescue, onto America's front pages,
James Charles Kopp was in the van riding alongside him, according
to former leaders of Operation Rescue who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   And, those people say, when Terry was arrested on the first day
of Operation Rescue's ``Siege of Atlanta,'' Kopp followed him into
jail. Along with more than one hundred other Operation Rescue
members, according to some people who were there, Kopp remained in
jail for 40 days and adhered to Terry's orders not to give a real
name to the police or courts.
</P>
<P>
   After his release, Kopp returned to Operation Rescue's
Binghamton headquarters, and was there working alongside Terry as
the group's power and influence in the anti-abortion movement
surged in late 1988 and 1989, according to the former leaders of
Operation Rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Kopp is being sought by federal and local law enforcement
authorities for questioning as a material witness in the murder of
an obstetrician who performed abortions in the Buffalo region.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities also say he may have information that will help
solve four other sniper attacks on doctors who performed abortions
in Canada and upstate New York. Some abortion-rights groups are
seizing on Kopp's role in Operation Rescue to raise new questions
about the connections between the recent anti-abortion violence and
the hard-line anti-abortion protest groups that burst onto the
national scene in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice
Department have looked in vain for evidence to determine whether a
national conspiracy might be behind a series of clinic bombings and
shootings of doctors and other clinic staff members that began in
the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury in Alexandria, Va., that looked into
conspiracy allegations was ultimately disbanded without finding a
national underground.
</P>
<P>
   But some federal law enforcement officials say they hope that
Kopp may help provide such a link. In fact, the announcement that
law enforcement officials are looking for him has been made as
Attorney General Janet Reno has prepared to revive an interagency
task force to look once again for possible conspiracies behind
anti-abortion crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law enforcement officials and the authorities say Kopp
is not now a suspect in the sniper attack on Oct. 23 that killed
Dr. Barnett A. Slepian near Buffalo. But they say Kopp's car was
seen near Slepian's home in Amherst, N.Y. in the weeks before the
doctor was shot.
</P>
<P>
   One day after issuing a warrant for Kopp's arrest as a material
witness, law enforcement officials from at least 10 agencies
spanning the United States and Canadian border still had not
located Kopp Thursday. But law enforcement officials said they were
pursuing many tips, including about 400 that have poured into the
FBI's information line: (800) 281-1184.
</P>
<P>
   The police have gone through photographs of abortion protesters
and clinic workers in Buffalo and around the country, and they are
also reviewing hundreds of hours of videotapes of demonstrations in
search of Kopp's face.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, officials consider the shooting of Slepian to be
connected to three attacks in Canada and one in Rochester on
doctors who provide abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The five attacks, all since 1994, occurred in the weeks leading
up to Nov. 11, Veterans Day _ called Remembrance Day in Canada _ a
holiday that has become important to anti-abortion activists. But
the attacks were spread over four years and 3,000 miles, from
Vancouver, British Columbia, to Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   As is the case with many early veterans of Operation Rescue,
Kopp was transformed into a hard-core anti-abortion militant in
jail in Atlanta in 1988, according to many people who were in jail
with him who insisted on anonymity.

   MOSCOW _ Though it seems a moot point, Russia's Constitutional
Court said the nation's 1993 constitution prohibits President Boris
Yeltsin from seeking re-election in 2000. The constitution limits
presidents to two terms in office, but Yeltsin was first elected in
1991 under a Soviet constitution that pre-dated Russian
independence. A spokesman for Yeltsin said that the president was
satisfied with the ruling. Yeltsin has come under growing pressure

LONG DISPUTE ENDS AS BERLIN COURT BACKS ISLAMIC SCHOOL LESSONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ After a long dispute, a Berlin court has ruled that the
city's 35,000 Muslim children will be allowed to receive Islamic
religious instruction in schools for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, long resisted by the city government, opens the
way for the Islamic Federation, a group representing many of
Berlin's 220,000 Muslims, to give lessons on the Koran and Islamic
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now no such instruction had been available, although
classes in the Roman Catholic and Protestant faiths were offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We delayed this much too long, and the result was the decision
ended up in court,'' said Barbara John, the city's commissioner for
foreign affairs. ``The fact is, there is a growing phobia about
Islam in European countries linked to television images of Iraq,
Algeria and Iran, and that fear is gravely misplaced.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision reflects Germany's gradual and painful
reconciliation with the fact that it is a multi-ethnic state with
by far the largest population of foreigners _ more than 7 million _
in Europe. Last month the new Social Democratic government agreed
on draft legislation that would make it easier for these
foreigners, who include about 2.2 million Turks, to become German.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where religious education is generally obligatory,
Berlin is one of only three federal states that have made religion
a voluntary subject. The others are Bremen and Brandenburg.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities here have left it primarily to the Catholic and
Protestant churches to organize classes and curriculums in two free
hours provided every week. About 40 percent of pupils have chosen
to attend.
</P>
<P>
   But under the pretext that no suitable organization existed to
represent the city's large Muslim population in drawing up a
syllabus, Berlin had barred Islamic instruction despite a campaign
by the Islamic Federation that lasted more than 10 years and ended
up in court.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We had been forced to send our children to mosques'' to
receive instruction in their spare time, said Bekir Durak, the
chairman of the federation's executive committee. ``The problem is
that the media have often portrayed us as radicals, although our
ideals are tolerance and understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some doubts persist about the nature of the federation,
which is generally regarded as the most radical of three large
Islamic groups in Berlin. The others are the Turkish Islamic Union
and the Islamic Cultural Centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unfortunate that the court identified only one
organization, and the one seen by other groups as closest to the
fundamentalists,'' Ms. John said. ``But this is the result of our
own failure to come up with a different solution earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   The Turkish Islamic Union has in the past complained that the
federation is close to the Welfare Party, the populist Islamic
movement in Turkey that is now banned. But Durak said that such
allegations were unfounded and that the federation was prepared to
work with the other two Islamic groups to agree on an educational
program.
</P>
<P>
   Of Berlin's Muslim population, about 70 percent are Turks, with
other large communities from Bosnia and Lebanon. The city has 70
mosques.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued Thursday, the Berlin City Council said
that all classes on Islam in the city should be taught in German,
and it urged the three main Islamic organizations to ``form a joint
association with the aim of defining the framework of lessons.''
Classes are expected to begin next summer.

RANGERS COULD SIGN SANCHEZ IF CLAYTON LEAVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Texas Rangers were presented with another option at
shortstop yesterday when the San Francisco Giants declined to
exercise their option on Rey Sanchez, making him a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Doug Melvin said he could have an interest in
Sanchez if the Rangers are unable to re-sign free-agent shortstop
Royce Clayton. The Rangers temporarily broke off talks with Clayton
on Thursday, but they could resume later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez, a former Rangers minor-leaguer, hit .285 in 109 games
with the Giants this year, splitting time at shortstop with Rich
Aurilia. Sanchez, 31, has never been an everyday shortstop in the
major leagues, but was Melvin's next option to explore last season
if he hadn't been able to acquire Clayton from the St. Louis
Cardinals on July 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some question whether he can play regularly,'' Melvin
said. ``He hasn't been given the opportunity. I think he can, but
you would need a veteran backup behind him. He's a pretty good
fielder who does the little things with the bat you would want from
somebody down at that end of the order.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Rangers can't sign Clayton or Sanchez they would have to
trade for someone such as Jeff Blauser or Jose Vizcaino. But
Sanchez, who made $1.4 million last year, said yesterday, ``I'd be
the cheapest one, and I would do the same job or better than those
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants are interested in re-signing Sanchez at a lower
salary. Pitching a priority Today marks the first day clubs can
talk contract with other free agents besides their own, but the
Rangers' priorities remain pitching and shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are actively pursuing pitcher Randy Johnson, and
Melvin is planning to meet with club president Tom Schieffer today
to discuss the situation. The Rangers are likely to tender an offer
to Johnson soon.
</P>
<P>
   Big names not on list Melvin is not getting involved with other
big-name free agents, most notably Yankees center fielder Bernie
Williams and Orioles first baseman Rafael Palmeiro.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, the American League batting champion, could command a
contract equal to or greater than the $91 million deal signed by
Mets catcher Mike Piazza last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's a good fit for us,'' Melvin said.
``You've got to be careful giving a lot of money to one guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark files; Zeile silent The Rangers still have interest in
first baseman Will Clark, who filed for free agency yesterday, but
Melvin said the Rangers might have to sacrifice some hitting to
upgrade their pitching.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers also didn't hear from third baseman Todd Zeile , who
had until 11 p.m. yesterday to demand a trade. Zeile had that right
because he was traded in the middle of a multi-year contract, but
he declined to exercise it.]

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: WHY NEWT GINGRICH IS IN DEEP, DEEP TROUBLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By GAIL COLLINS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just four years ago, it was a good bet that Newt Gingrich would
be the pivotal figure in U.S. politics at the turn of the
millennium. Seemingly overnight he had taken a moribund minority
party and turned it into a pumped-up, issue-driven House majority.
With a promise to balance the budget, end welfare and represent
more conservative social values, he appeared to have rearranged the
political map for Congress just as Ronald Reagan had done for the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But Gingrich's leadership is now so shaky that even if he
maintains his hold on the speaker's office, he is in danger of
marginalization. A change this dramatic suggests something far more
profound than a miscalculation about election tactics. What looked
like one of the major realignments in U.S. political history might
turn out to have been nothing but a temporary shift.
</P>
<P>
   The Gingrich revolution was fueled by anger, a revolt of white
working-class Americans against what they perceived as a Democratic
bias in favor of blacks and other minorities, and a middle-class
rejection of the politics of big government and big deficits. They
were the same resentments that Ronald Reagan had exploited so
successfully. But old political habits and a moribund Republican
leadership allowed the Democrats to retain control of Congress
throughout the 1980s, and turned Reagan's economic program into an
undisciplined tax-cutting spree that created prosperity along with
huge budget gaps.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's attention-grabbing rhetoric, energy and talent for
political organization finally took Reagan's formula for success to
the congressional elections in 1994. But once in power, he ran head
on into Bill Clinton, whose political instincts were even better.
The president co-opted parts of the Contract With America,
particularly the balanced budget and welfare reform. He adapted the
Republican social message into a call for things like school
uniforms and television rating systems, which symbolized more
responsibility and parental control without supporting government
intrusion into private lives.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican right's genuine contempt for Clinton was based in
part on the well-known flaws in the president's character. But it
was mainly a reaction to the ease with which he had diverted what
was supposed to be the flood tide of their revolution. They
expected that the genuine successes of Gingrich's first year in
office would lead to still larger victories for minimal government
and taxes, unfettered free enterprise and a return to conservative
Christian values. But the public was happy to be led in another
direction, and focus on the concerns of aging baby boomers about
health care and Social Security. The government that was seen as
the enemy when the issues were budgetary once again looked like a
potential ally.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1994, both parties were so stunned by the sudden change
in their congressional fortunes that they may have overestimated
what it all meant. In particular they may not have realized how
quickly good economic times, a drop in crime and national welfare
reform could blunt the power of race in U.S. politics. The
Democrats had become literally a minority party as white voters
resentfully identified their policies with cities, blacks and
immigrants. But last week union workers and Catholics returned to
the Democratic fold. Without race as a wedge issue, the solid black
Democratic vote became a powerful advantage in key states. Blacks,
women and Latinos angry at Republican anti-immigration initiatives
were the winning coalition in California, North Carolina and New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker was right to say this was ``not the election we
expected.'' There may indeed be a Republican majority in America,
but it appears to resemble the Republicanism of Dwight Eisenhower
rather than Newt Gingrich _ pro-business, wary of debt and with an
inherent distaste for bringing up messy social issues like
abortion. The Republicans who have begun talking about
``compassionate conservatism'' and ``the politics of inclusion''
may be peddling political mush, but they peddled it to victory on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional Republican Party's long sojourn in the
wilderness of the House minority may have left it too accustomed to
opposition to figure out what it can be for, and too attached to
the politics of anger to make sense of a nation in the mood for
moderation. Gingrich has suggested that his mistake was to let the
Republicans drift along on the politics of impeachment when they
should have been ``almost maniacally focused'' on things like tax
cuts. But looking maniacal is what got them into trouble in the
first place. Winning control of Congress after so many years was
very tough for Gingrich in 1994. But it will be ten times tougher
to forge a politics that does not depend on rage.

TYSON CHOOSES GOOSSEN TO PROMOTE HIS FIGHTS
</HEADLINE>

By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In boxing parlance, Dan Goossen has come off the
canvas to score a devastating knockout.
</P>
<P>
   Goossen, the former head of the defunct Ten Goose Boxing in
North Hollywood, said Thursday that his Denver-based company,
America Presents, will promote the profoundly lucrative fights of
Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Goossen declined to speak in detail about his deal with the
former heavyweight champion pending a formal announcement.
</P>
<P>
   However, he has come a long way since the days he promoted
fights at the Country Club in Reseda and wanted to share the
excitement with those who were around during leaner times.
</P>
<P>
   He made the announcement almost casually at a news conference in
Los Angeles to promote a WBC super lightweight championship bout
between Miguel Angel Gonzalez and Kostya Tszyu on Nov. 28 in Indio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted this to be the first place where I could look
everyone in the eye and kind of enjoy the moment,'' said Goossen,
who lives in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a lot of long years to get to where we are today.''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as four years ago, Goossen's future in boxing didn't
seem quite as bright.
</P>
<P>
   He dissolved Ten Goose _ the family business _ because of
financial difficulties and was hired by promoter Bob Arum as an
executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Two and a half years ago, he took a gamble by leaving Arum and
joining forces with television executive Matt Tinley to form
America Presents. The company has slowly stockpiled big-name
fighters, the biggest being Olympic champion David Reid, and works
regularly with Fox and HBO.
</P>
<P>
   However, nothing compares to this.
</P>
<P>
   Goossen, whose wit and charm can be endearing, had been courting
Tyson and his new handlers during what turned out to be the
fighter's 16-month suspension from boxing for biting off a portion
of Evander Holyfield's ear last year.
</P>
<P>
   It paid off in a monstrous way. Tyson, one of the biggest
money-makers in sports, could earn Goossen and Co. untold millions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's huge,'' said Tom Brown, Goossen's brother in law and
long-time matchmaker. ``I think a guy like Tyson looks at us kind
of like the situation he's in: We're all fighting outside obstacles
and all the other problems just to do our job and earn our living.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, yes, Dan's personality played a huge roll. That was the
key.''
</P>
<P>
   Goossen wouldn't say when Tyson will resume his career but it
has been reported the fight will take place Jan. 16 at the MGM
Grand Hotel in Las Vegas, the site of the ear biting.
</P>
<P>
   Among possible opponents: Francois Botha, Vaughn Bean and Axel
Schulz, all fairly well-known heavyweights.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, negotiations continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our work is cut out for us now,'' Goossen said, generally
speaking. ``It never stops. You always keep working, whether it's
for Miguel, for the Ruelases (Gabriel and Rafael) or for Mike. It's
all the same. You have to keep working hard.''

GOP DECISION BOOSTS L.A. HOPES FOR 2000 CONVENTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Republicans have decided to hold their 2000
national convention in Philadelphia, boosting Los Angeles' hopes to
host the Democratic National Convention in two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is tremendous news for us,'' said Bill Wardlaw,
co-chairman of a private group seeking to bring the event to Los
Angeles. ``If you take this along with the victories we had in
Tuesday's election, it is just icing on the cake for why Los
Angeles should be chosen.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly important is the election of Democratic Lt. Gov.
Gray Davis as governor, which organizers believe pushes Los Angeles
ahead of its main competition, Boston and Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we have a Democratic governor with Gray Davis and a
Democratic Legislature,'' said Roz Wyman, a member of the
Democratic Convention Site Selection Committee that is pushing for
the event to be held in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party officials close to the decision-making process
told The Associated Press that Los Angeles was now the top site
being considered because vote-rich California is critical to
Democratic presidential campaign strategies.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first actions Davis took after winning election was
to write the White House urging that Los Angeles be awarded the
convention, Wyman said.
</P>
<P>
   The DNC site selection committee is scheduled to select three
finalists next week, and lobbying is under way for Denver and
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   After the finalists are chosen, a special delegation will visit
each of the cities again, with a decision expected shortly after
the first of the year.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Republican Party Chairman Jim Nicholson released a
statement announcing the selection of Philadelphia over four other
cities, San Antonio, New York, New Orleans and Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The decision emboldened Los Angeles organizers, who believed
Philadelphia was their major competitor because of the close
personal relationship between Vice President Al Gore and
Philadelphia Mayor Edward Rendell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't hold our convention in the same city,'' Wyman said.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of Denver and Boston is because Roy Romer, DNC
co-chairman, is governor of Colorado and co-Chairman Steve Grossman
is from Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   But Wyman remained confident of Los Angeles' prospects. ``I
never understood how Philadelphia was so strong since they have a
Republican governor and a Republican Legislature,'' Wyman said.
</P>
<P>
   And, Wardlaw said, the DNC will be constantly reminded of
California's political clout with its 54 electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles has put together a $27 million private effort to win
the convention, estimated to bring $137 million to the city along
with some 30,000 visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan was pleased with the GOP selection of
Philadelphia, an aide said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He feels this puts Los Angeles at the top of the list,'' said
spokeswoman Noelia Rodriguez. ``The mayor is supporting this very
strongly.'' &QL;

HEAD OF IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY ASKS CLINTON WHETHER HE LIED UNDER
OATH

 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Forging ahead with an impeachment inquiry that most
Americans say Congress should drop, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., asked
President Clinton Thursday to say flatly whether he lied under
oath, tampered with witnesses or obstructed justice.
</P>
<P>
   In an 11-page letter, Hyde, chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, asked Clinton to admit or deny 81 selected findings
gleaned from the independent counsel's 445-page report on the
president's affair with Monica Lewinsky. Hyde had indicated to the
White House a few weeks ago that he would ask Clinton to
acknowledge certain assertions in the report.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said the president could speed the process by not disputing
the findings. But many questions are pointed and ask Clinton to
admit to accusations that he and his advisers have strenuously
denied since the independent counsel Kenneth Starr sent his
scathing report to Congress. For example, question No. 20:
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you admit or deny that you gave false and misleading
testimony under oath when you stated during your deposition in the
case of Jones v. Clinton on Jan. 17, 1998, that you did not know if
Monica Lewinsky had been subpoenaed to testify in that case?''
</P>
<P>
   Answering such questions, Hyde said, would help wrap up the
inquiry by the end of the year. ``No one should take these requests
as establishing our final conclusions,'' he said. ``Rather, they
will simply help us to establish what facts are in dispute and what
facts are not.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Craig, the White House coordinator of impeachment
strategy, Thursday night called Hyde's questions predictable and
said: ``I don't think our answers are going to change the dynamics
of the inquiry. We're going to work our way through it and make a
good-faith effort to respond to it in a timely manner, sooner
rather than later.'' Craig said the White House reply would
probably come before Nov. 13, when the president leaves on a 10-day
visit to Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the appropriate time, in the appropriate way, we will say
whatever we intend to say,'' Clinton told reporters at a meeting
with Democratic congressional leaders at the White House. ``The
important thing is that we've got to get back to doing the people's
business.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Chicago, Hyde described the letter to
Clinton as he outlined the schedule for the inquiry against the
president.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Hyde underscored his goal to wrap up the inquiry
this year, announcing that the committee would very likely summon
only one witness, Starr, on Nov. 19. Hyde also said that assertions
from some committee aides on Wednesday that the panel would vote on
articles of impeachment by Thanksgiving were incorrect.
</P>
<P>
   But the shock waves from Democratic gains in the midterm
election on Tuesday have injected new doubts and uncertainty into
the impeachment process, lawmakers said Thursday. And any
alternative to impeachment, like censure, has been complicated by
the leadership fight that has broken out among House Republicans in
recriminations over the election debacle.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said Thursday that the election would have ``no significant
impact'' on the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But whether voters intended to or not, the outcome of the
election has been widely viewed by many Democrats and Republicans
as a referendum on the scope and scale of the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly doesn't make our job any easier,'' said Rep. Bob
Barr, R-Ga., who is one of Clinton's fiercest critics on the
committee. ``There'll be no impact on what we do on the Judiciary
Committee. But other Republicans' view of impeachment will be
colored in by political considerations.''
</P>
<P>
   In light of public resistance to removing Clinton from office,
the slim Republican majority in the House seems to stand little
chance of mustering the 218 votes required for impeachment. ``Some
people are really depressed,'' said a Republican aide. ``It's taken
the wind out of our sails.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats seized on their gain of five seats in the House of
Representatives and polls of voters that showed Americans' strong
desire to end the inquiry now. Rep. John Conyers Jr. of Michigan,
the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said, ``If the
election has made clear one thing it is this: The American people
do not want President Clinton impeached.''
</P>
<P>
   The truncated schedule Hyde described today would abandon plans
to call such central figures as Bruce Lindsey, the presidential
aide, and Vernon Jordan, Clinton's longtime friend and confidant,
although Hyde said more witnesses could be added.
</P>
<P>
   Other committee Republicans praised Hyde's approach. ``Bringing
in witnesses to rehash testimony that's already concretely in the
record would be a waste of time and serve no purpose at all,'' said
Rep. George Gekas, R-Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, only Starr will testify, probably for two days. Starr
has expressed eagerness to defend his four-year, $40 million
inquiry that critics say has turned into a personal vendetta
against the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the center of this inquiry,'' Hyde said at his news
conference in Chicago. ``He's someone everybody wants to hear from,
and we're going to give him that opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats want Starr to testify, to put him on the
defensive. But other Democrats fear Starr could make a compelling
case against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a greater risk for the White House are the 81 questions
Hyde posed on Thursday. Some simply restate the president's job
title: ``Do you admit or deny that you are the chief
law-enforcement officer of the United States of America?''
</P>
<P>
   Other questions ask Clinton to affirm that he met or spoke with
Jordan or Ms. Lewinsky at a particular time on a particular date.
</P>
<P>
   Most go to the heart of the accusations Starr has made. For
example, question No. 27: ``Do you admit or deny that on or about
Dec. 28, 1998, you requested, instructed, suggested to or otherwise
discussed with Betty Currie that she take possession of gifts
previously given to Monica Lewinsky by you?'' Hyde denied the
questions constituted a witch hunt. ``It would be a witch hunt if
we served him with a subpoena to come in, get under oath and
testify to a cross-examination from all members,'' Hyde said.
``That would be pushing the envelope. We're doing it in the most
genteel way.''
</P>
<P>
   With the possibility of impeachment growing dimmer, attention is
shifting to a group of 10 committee moderates who have been
exploring alternative punishment, including censure.
</P>
<P>
   But that exit strategy faces several hurdles. Hyde and many
Republicans say it is premature to talk about a deal now.
</P>
<P>
   The likely candidate with enough stature to broker an
alternative, if the moment was right, is Speaker Newt Gingrich. But
Gingrich has his hands full trying to quell a rebellion of party
members unhappy over the election results.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., who is one of the committee
moderates, said the election results would ``keep discussion
alive'' on some alternate punishment. ``But the difficulty is
finding an alternative that's constitutional and politically
acceptable,'' Hutchinson said.

DEMOCRAT'S CLIMB TO TREASURER ENDS WITH 2,000 VOTES TO SPARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JULIAN E. BARNES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ No other candidate in Connecticut had a
tougher time getting on the ballot than Denise Nappier. She had to
battle for her party's nomination for state treasurer at the
Democratic convention this summer, and then fight a rematch in the
September primary. Then on Tuesday night, when most other
candidates left post-election parties knowing their fates, Ms.
Nappier still had to wait _ her race was too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until late Wednesday night that she was named the
winner in her race, defeating the current state treasurer, Paul
Silvester, by 2,810 votes and depriving Gov. John Rowland of any
Republican company among the top state offices. ``I have a renewed
appreciation for the Democratic process,'' Ms. Nappier said
Thursday as she finally savored her victory. ``I liken it to the
volatility of the market.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last nine years, Ms. Nappier, 47, has had to deal with
market volatility as treasurer of Hartford, overseeing the city's
pensions and bond offerings. Now she assumes the job at the state
level, handling the state's $17 billion pension fund.
</P>
<P>
   The presence on the ballot of Ms. Nappier, who is black, was a
major goal this year of Rep. Barbara Kennelly, who was ultimately
unsuccessful as the Democratic candidate for governor. After the
Republicans nominated two Hispanic candidates and a black candidate
for their ticket, Rowland began trumpeting his party's leadership
as the most diverse.
</P>
<P>
   With the backing of Mrs. Kennelly and black leaders, Ms. Nappier
won a close vote at the convention, over Frank Lecce, an
Italian-American who had spent two years lining up support for his
candidacy. Lecce stormed out of the convention and challenged Ms.
Nappier in the primary. Despite being outspent by Lecce, she won
handily.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had to struggle from the beginning,'' said the Rev. Wade
Hyslop, Jr., the deputy speaker of the state House of
Representatives and an early supporter of Ms. Nappier.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nappier said her biggest problem in the election was raising
money, in part because of a law blocking employees of companies
doing business with the state from contributing to the treasurer's
race. In Hartford, she said, many potential contributors were
middle managers in financial service companies who cannot
contribute to campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nappier said she held a $15-a-person fund-raiser for her
neighbors, but many could not come because of the law. ``It's hard
to believe that because someone gives you $15,'' she said, ``you
are going to give them a $50 million contract.''

EX-HEAD OF JUSTICE DEPT. INQUIRY IS BARRED FROM GIVING TWO TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Charles La Bella, the former head of the Justice
Department's Campaign Finance Task Force, has been ordered by aides
to Attorney General Janet Reno not to speak at two conferences on
campaign finance law.
</P>
<P>
   La Bella has urged Ms. Reno to seek the appointment of an
independent counsel to investigate accusations of campaign finance
abuses in the 1996 election. The attorney general has resisted
naming an outside counsel for more than a year, although she is
considering whether to seek independent prosecutors in three 1996
fund-raising controversies. She is expected to decide late this
month or early December.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Reno's aides said their insistence that La Bella refrain
from public appearances reflected nothing more than the routine
application of a rule that prohibits prosecutors from speaking
publicly about high-profile cases. La Bella's allies maintained
that the rule was not applied in all cases and complained that he
was muzzled because his views were strikingly at odds with the
conventional thinking in the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   In July La Bella sent Ms. Reno a memorandum advising her that
the department should refer the entire campaign finance matter to
an outside prosecutor. He then returned to the U.S. attorney's
office in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-October, the department told La Bella to withdraw from
two speaking engagements at campaign finance conferences he had
accepted months earlier _ one in Washington, sponsored by
Congressional Quarterly, and another in New York City, sponsored by
the New York City Campaign Finance Board and the Association of the
Bar of the City of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret having spent a year doing this and not being able to
speak publicly,'' La Bella said in a telephone interview. In
letters to the sponsoring organizations, he said he had planned
careful remarks on campaign finance that were limited to the law
and published court decisions. But he also said he ``understood''
the logic of the decision.

AGENCY TANGLED IN WEB BY EARLY RELEASE OF DATA 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SYLVIA NASAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an embarrassing blunder that illustrates the pitfalls facing
the government in the Information Age, the Bureau of Labor
Statistics inadvertently posted part of its closely guarded jobs
report on the Internet a day before the report's scheduled release.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some investors got an advance peek at the economy's
performance in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have procedures in place,'' Katharine Abraham, the bureau's
commissioner, said. ``They obviously didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, Ms. Abraham said she would not be able to
explain what went wrong until Friday at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Monthly job data are normally released on a Friday, usually the
first one of the following month.
</P>
<P>
   The main concern about security involves the circulation of
information within the government. The bureau normally releases
manufacturing employment figures to the Federal Reserve two days
before the official report is released so that the central bank can
use it to estimate industrial production. On Thursday night, it
provides a complete report to the Council of Economic Advisers,
which briefs the president's economics team and passes the data
along to the Treasury and the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's glitch was not the first involving the bureau's
four-year-old World Wide Web site. Two years ago, a report on
producer prices was posted the night before it was scheduled for
release. Unlike Thursday, though, bureau staff almost immediately
discovered the mistake and retrieved the report.
</P>
<P>
   This time, a full 24 hours before the jobs report was scheduled
to be released, a table reviewing job increases and declines by
industry was mistakenly posted on the bureau's Web site
(www.bls.gov). It was a background table prepared for internal use
that had only recently been added to the charts the bureau makes
available with its jobs report.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Stone, head of the Stone &AMP; McCarthy brokerage firm, was
one individual who found it while browsing the site. Stone alerted
the bureau _ but also shared the report, which showed that job
growth in October was much softer than had been expected, with his
clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people use the Web to make vacation plans, some people
use it to buy a new car,'' he said on CNBC Thursday. ``I go look at
economic data.''
</P>
<P>
   The leak did not particularly rattle financial markets. ``We're
lucky that markets are fixated on other things and that they're
paying much less attention to economic data,'' Bruce Steinberg,
chief economist at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., said. ``It's a pretty
shocking event, and it had an impact, but it didn't have the impact
it could have had.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Katz, an economist at Harvard University and a former
chief economist at the Labor Department, said he assumed the leak
had been an innocent mistake. ``In the past, even when there have
been rumors of a leak, it's been taken very seriously,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The frenetic Madison Avenue takeover spree keeps going and going
and going as yet another well-regarded independent agency is being
acquired.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest deal, the acquisitive Interpublic Group of
Companies said that as expected it had bought Gillespie in
Lawrenceville, N.J. Though terms of the deal were not disclosed,
trade publications estimated the purchase price at $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, which is expected to be formally announced
Thursday, Gillespie _ an integrated marketing communications agency
that is best known for its direct-marketing capabilities _ will
keep its name and operate as an autonomous unit in Interpublic's
McCann Relationship Marketing Worldwide network of agencies, part
of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This partnership will provide new opportunities to accelerate
our growth by providing current and future clients with access to a
worldwide network of offices, increased research capabilities and
highly sophisticated resources in areas such as the Internet and
Web commerce,'' said Dick Gillespie, president and chief executive
of Gillespie, which is formally called the Gillespie Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction is the most recent example of a trend in which
small and midsized independent shops are being rapidly snapped up
by larger agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Other recent examples include the acquisition of
Hampel/Stefanides in New York by Envoy Communications Group in
Toronto and Margeotes/Fertitta &AMP; Partners in New York, which sold a
majority interest to the MDC Communications Corp. in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Gillespie, 54, who will continue to head the agency in his
current roles, said that since last spring, Gillespie had received
seven acquisition offers from a wide range of domestic and
international communications companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never were for sale, but the offers kept coming,''
Gillespie said. ``The Interpublic and McCann-Erickson alliance
makes great sense, because it will help us meet our long-term
agency goals more quickly.'' Those goals include one that Gillespie
set last year to build the shop's billings $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   Gillespie, founded in 1973 by Gillespie with $1,500 in start-up
capital, has grown into a shop with 135 employees and an estimated
$140 million in billings from clients including American
Reinsurance, Cushman &AMP; Wakefield, Elizabeth Arden Red Door Salons
and Janssen Pharmaceutica.
</P>
<P>
   Besides direct marketing, the agency offers a wide spectrum of
services including traditional advertising, branding, data-base
marketing, public relations, event marketing, corporate design and
interactive marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made an extensive search of what independent agencies
remain at this point,'' Stan Rapp, chairman and chief executive of
McCann Relationship Marketing, said. ``We identified Gillespie as
the best agency, because they weren't just focused in one area.
They bring considerable experience across a diverse number of
business categories.''
</P>
<P>
   Rapp said that over time Gillespie had ``demonstrated again and
again that brand building and the best result-generating
communications beautifully complement one another.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a perfect fit with the network we are building around
the world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gillespie acquisition is the seventh for the McCann
Relationship Marketing unit since it was formed in January 1997 as
the successor to McCann Direct. The acquisition comes just a week
after it expanded its overseas operations by acquiring agencies in
Australia, Japan and Spain with estimated combined billings of $60
million.
</P>
<P>
   Rapp said the agency planned to continue to grow by opening
additional offices in Chicago and Los Angeles, in addition to
announcing the acquisitions of five more agencies, primarily in
Europe and Latin America, by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not just snapping up agencies,'' he said. ``We are very
carefully approaching and merging with agencies that will meet our
strategic goals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The emergence of a globalized network digital economy sets the
stage for a future in which one-to-one relationship marketing
becomes the dominant force in marketing communications and becomes
the fastest-growing segment in the agency business,'' he said.
``So, everybody is positioning themselves for that future.''
</P>
<P>
   McCann Relationship Marketing has 700 employees in 36 offices in
30 countries and billings estimated at $610 million from clients
including General Motors, Mastercard International and Sprint. Rapp
said the agency planned to expand the network by 1999 to $1 billion
in billings.

PROFILE: AT 29, AN ELDER STATESMAN OF INTERNET EROTICA 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   He is the president of his industry's trade group, a well-known
Internet pioneer who has floated above the red ink that has drowned
so many other entrepreneurs, but Mark Tiarra still asks that a
reporter not mention the northern New Jersey town where he conducts
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a stuffy place around here,'' he said. ``A lot of people
wouldn't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   So let it simply be said that Tiarra works most days in a
nondescript building in Bergen County, not far from Ridgewood,
producing, marketing and carefully manipulating the most popular
commodity on the World Wide Web: adult entertainment. And as a
measure of how rapidly that industry has grown, Tiarra, who has
been in the business only about four years, has become one of its
elder statesmen, a highly sought-after guru who is now making
plenty of money as a consultant to aspiring Webmasters of
cyberporn. He is 29 years old and has the interview spiel down pat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with basing a business on human
sexuality,'' he said, relaxing in front of an enormous computer
monitor. ``Of course, we don't even do that many hard-core sites.
There's nothing wrong with it, but it just doesn't appeal to my
tastes. Our sites try to cross the line between art and erotica.''
</P>
<P>
   He is mildly dismissive of the thousands of coarse, tumbledown
Web sites that fail to surround their flesh pictures with the
proper graphical environment, but for Tiarra, the president of the
United Adult Sites, there is a limit to condescension. The
nonprofit organization, formed in 1996, is the trade association of
adult Web sites. It has established a code of ethics for its 500
members and lobbied in Washington against restrictions like the
Child Online Protection Act, signed into law last month by
President Clinton and immediately challenged by Internet
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Justice Department doesn't even know how it's going to
enforce it,'' he said. ``If I were the Supreme Court, I'd be
insulted that they passed it.'' The law penalizes commercial Web
sites that fail to keep ``harmful material'' out of the hands of
minors.
</P>
<P>
   With his long, limp black hair and faint beard, Tiarra looks
more like the musician and record producer he says he would prefer
to be than the pornography industry authority he has become. But he
is immensely knowledgeable and utterly straightforward about the
details of his work, and though he has no business background,
others in the industry say his marketing abilities are remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark is known as a genius at directing traffic,'' said Fay
Sharp, who runs the XWebexpo, a trade show held twice a year for
the adult Web industry. ``Someone sets up a site and they need to
have traffic into the site or they die. So they call Mark and they
buy traffic from him, and it's not yucky traffic _ it's people who
pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Traffic, for the uninitiated, refers to the number of people who
look at a Web page, and ideally, give out their credit card numbers
for a peek at password-protected photos. (According to several
industry estimates, more than half the Internet's bandwidth, or
capacity, is taken up with traffic in adult material.) By setting
up carefully manipulative advertisements on his own popular sites,
Tiarra can send his traffic to other sites, charging them for the
privilege.
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, he realized that thousands of people had read
about the gold rush of profit possibilities in cyberporn and were
trying to enter the industry with no knowledge or ability. So, just
as in the mainstream computer world, he began selling his knowledge
to new Webmasters, and is now offering complete packages to
entrepreneurs with cash. The basic package starts at $3,499, for
which a buyer gets two galleries of photos, several completely
designed Web pages and a month of consulting advice. The ``platinum
package'' goes for $34,999 and includes a huge gallery of photos,
live video feeds, credit card processing, advertising and three
months of consulting.
</P>
<P>
   His company, Tiarracorp, now has seven full-time employees and
60 or 70 contractors around the world who design the sites. This,
of course, is where the big money is. Thousands of inexperienced
adult Webmasters have gone under with the increasing competition,
but his company has made several million dollars for the last three
years, and his telephone continues to ring as newcomers seek out an
honest reputation in a rough trade filled with swindlers.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few years ago, he had never seen the Internet, coming
late to the industry. He grew up in Bergen County, the son of a
data-processing executive. He was allowed to play with an Apple 2C
and a guitar in high school. He took music in college and later
worked in a printing business until a friend asked him to design a
Web site for a band. He studied the Internet and by 1994 realized
there was only one likely way to make money with it, appealing to a
very old-fashioned instinct. His Web sites range from the grandiose
(``All the Beauty That Is Woman'') to the crass (``The Girls of
Tiarracorp''), but every evening, they are seen by thousands of Web
surfers, many with credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a 2-year-old son, and I don't want him seeing these
sites until he knows the difference between love and sex,'' Tiarra
said. ``Nobody wants kids on their sites. They cost you bandwidth,
and they don't have a credit card to buy anything you have.''

BROSIUS AND YANKS AGREE AS OTHERS TEST THE WATERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If all free-agent situations were as easy to resolve
as Scott Brosius' status with the New York Yankees, Friday would be
an insignificant day in the 23rd year of Major League Baseball free
agency. But the Yankees' new agreement with Brosius is an
exception, which is why it is time to let the offers begin.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams, Mo Vaughn, Randy Johnson and Kevin Brown, the
elite of this year's market, and 130 other free agents can sign
with any team beginning Friday. Their 1998 teams no longer have
exclusive negotiating rights. Albert Belle, free until Dec. 2
through a clause in his contract, is another elite hitter
available, but he did not have to wait until Friday to sign a new
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius is not among the free-agent group because he and the
Yankees have agreed to a three-year contract for $15.75 million.
The most difficult aspect of the negotiations, whose conclusion the
Yankees have not announced, was for Brosius' agent, Tony Attanasio,
to get his client what he felt was a fair deal.
</P>
<P>
   Attanasio was somewhat hamstrung because even before he filed
for free agency on Oct. 27, Brosius told the world he wanted to
remain with the Yankees. After a season in which he batted .300
with 19 home runs and 98 runs batted in, then became the World
Series' most valuable player, why wouldn't he want to stay?
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees began the negotiations offering less than $5 million
a year. On the open market, Brosius would command well in excess of
$5 million. After more talking, the Yankees raised their offer, and
earlier this week Brosius said done.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees should have it so easy with Williams. The premier
hitter in the market, Williams has not seen an offer from the
Yankees, who very likely want to wait to see what offers the market
will produce from other teams. Scott Boras, the center fielder's
agent, seeks a seven-year contract for more than the $91 million
the New York Mets bestowed on catcher Mike Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   On the final day of the 15-day filing period Thursday, two other
members of the Yankees added their names to the list, though
provisionally.
</P>
<P>
   David Cone and Darryl Strawberry still have 1999 options to
resolve, but they protected their rights by filing. They cannot
sign with another team before the options are acted on.
</P>
<P>
   Cone has until midnight next Wednesday to decide if he wants to
exercise the $5.5 million option in his contract. The Yankees have
the same deadline to decide if they want to pick up the $2.5
million option in Strawberry's contract.
</P>
<P>
   Cone and the club have been negotiating for weeks, Cone trying
to get two or three years on a new contract for about $8 million a
year, the Yankees offering $7 million for next season but nothing
beyond except an option year.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have a dilemma with the Strawberry option. If he
were healthy, they most likely would already have exercised the
option. But because he has colon cancer and his recovery is
uncertain, at least to the extent that he would be able to play
again, the Yankees are reluctant to guarantee $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four elite free agents, Vaughn is the only one who has
said he would like to stay with his team, the Boston Red Sox. The
chances of that happening are strictly up to the Red Sox, whose
previous negotiating stance alienated the burly first baseman.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship has not been good, but the Red Sox could make
it right by offering a five-year contract for the kind of money
other players of his stature have received.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have said they want to re-sign Williams, but he has
not said he wants to re-sign with them. He continues to hold a
grudge about previous contract negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Astros have made Johnson an offer, but he is also
considering Arizona, Los Angeles, Texas, Anaheim and the Yankees.
The San Diego Padres want to retain Brown, but Boras, his agent,
will listen to all interested parties. St. Louis, Colorado, Los
Angeles and Cleveland are expected to talk with Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is considered less willing than Johnson to play in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets took Al Leiter off the market by signing him to a
four-year, $32 million contract, leaving Todd Stottlemyre as the
most attractive pitcher below the Johnson-Brown top tier. Cone will
jump in there if he becomes available next week.
</P>
<P>
   Attanasio, Stottlemyre's agent, said he has heard from 11 teams
that said they wanted to talk about the pitcher. ``Most are looking
for the guy just below Brown and Johnson, or at him if they don't
get Brown or Johnson,'' Attanasio said.
</P>
<P>
   Belle is in a different position from the other free agents. If
he does not like the offers he receives, he can return to the
Chicago White Sox and pick up his original contract with them. It
guarantees him $35 million for the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Among the seven players who were the last to file Thursday were
Will Clark of Texas and Jim Abbott of the White Sox. Terry
Mulholland, who had previously filed, agreed to a two-year, $5.9
million contract with the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Midnight Thursday also was the deadline for eligible players to
demand a trade.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch did not, lending more credence to the belief
that he and the Yankees sometime ago agreed to a two-year, $18
million extension.
</P>
<P>
   Moises Alou, who hit 38 home runs and drove home 124 runs for
the Astros, was another player who was traded in the middle of a
multiyear contract. With three years left on a five-year, $25
million deal, he reached an agreement with Houston Thursday and did
not have to demand a trade as leverage.

NBC'S LAW OF GRAVITY: FUTURE IS WITH YOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 BY RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If form holds, half the viewers watching the Breeders' Cup races
on NBC Saturday will be at least 50 years old. Not that there's
anything wrong with being 50 or more, but this age group would not
be a television programmer's dream unless Angela Lansbury and Buddy
Ebsen were co-favorites in the Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Horse racing is trying to turn that around,'' said Dick
Ebersol, the chairman of NBC Sports. ``But it's hard after losing
audience over so much time.''
</P>
<P>
   Horse racing has a new national marketing organization, and the
once-clashing parts ofthe industry are working together. And
Saturday's Classic, with all-star equines like Skip Away and Silver
Charm, may help elevate the Breeders' Cup Nielsen rating above last
year's 2.2 and 1996's 2.5.
</P>
<P>
   But if the cast of ``Dawson's Creek'' isn't running, it is
unlikely that the afternoon of racing will rope in the youthful
viewers NBC wants to reach by launching the Gravity Games, summer
and winter extreme sports competitions geared to appeal to
teen-agers and people in their 20s.
</P>
<P>
   The first Gravity Games will be shown in two-hour taped blocks
on five consecutive Sundays next October, time slots once reserved
by NBC for National Football League games.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Thursday to announce Gravity, Ebersol said
a ``lost generation'' of viewers is increasingly turned off to the
mainstream sports shown by the networks. Two of those lost boys _
Ebersol's 8- and 12-year-old sons _ preferred in-line skating
around Martha's Vineyard on a recent vacation to watching Mark
McGwire and Sammy Sosa slug home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the days when there were just three networks, we all had a
good shot at reaching people from their earliest years,'' Ebersol
said. ``But the Nickelodeons of the world have grabbed kids at an
early age.''
</P>
<P>
   As ESPN did, by launching the X Games in 1995. By the time the
Gravity Games begin, ESPN and ESPN2 will have telecast eight Summer
and Winter X Games.
</P>
<P>
   NBC recognized that wakeboarding, street luge, dirt jumping,
motocross and skateboarding offer an opening to explore a viewer
niche that is rarely touched by conventional sports.
</P>
<P>
   The X Games have helped ESPN reach the viewers NBC craves.
Two-thirds of X Games viewers are under 35. Usually, 38 percent of
ESPN's audience is between 12 and 34, but for the X Games, it is 51
percent. Seven percent of ESPN's usual viewers are between 12 and
17, but for the X Games, it is 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The 50-and-over viewership? Eleven percent, almost negligible
when you consider that this age group makes up 33 percent of a
typical ESPN audience.
</P>
<P>
   NBC and its partner, Petersen Publishing _ which owns magazines
that cater to the alternative sports market, like Slam, Dirt Rider,
MX Racer, Gravity and Snowboard _ are convinced there is room for a
second major extreme event.
</P>
<P>
   The partners believe the musical, film and merchandising
elements that will surround the Gravity Games will broaden the core
audience, which network television needs even beyond what ESPN has
pioneered. ``We never sensed that ESPN owned the entirety of the
market,'' said Ken Schanzer, the president of NBC Sports. ``There's
an abundance of room.''
</P>
<P>
   As a consultant, NBC and Petersen hired Michael (Biker)
Sherlock, the many-medaled Carl Lewis of the X Games. Sherlock, a
street luger and skateboarder, said Gravity's competitions _ or
``comps,'' he called them _ will be ``edgy and core,'' and the
athletes ``will have a say in how the comps will go.'' The last was
an indication that ESPN somehow limited athletes' input at the X
Games.
</P>

   ``We designed the courses and competitions with the athletes,''
Mike Soltys, an ESPN spokesman, replied. ``They steer us in the
right direction. We have an athletes' council and each year the
courses evolve because of the council's input.''

<P>
   And so, NBC plunges into the Gravity Games, a cutting-edge event
that many traditional sports fans don't understand, and sticks by
the Breeders' Cup, an event that it helped create but that now
serves an audience on the blunted edge.

   ``It's a wonderful event, the world championship of horse
racing,'' Schanzer said. ``But commercially it's never been as
successful as we'd like it to be. We're dealing with a sport that's
declined.''

   The Lockout and the Riches
</P>
<P>
   National Basketball Association players have voiced their
displeasure that NBC and Turner Network Television will pay a
combined $465 million to the league this season, no matter how long
the lockout lasts. The payment is the smallest they will make
during the four years of their agreement. The sums increase
annually by 25 percent, to an estimated $581 million in 1999-2000,
$726 million in 2000-2001 and $907 million in 2001-2002.  &QL;

   NBC's Dick Ebersol said an announcement planned for this month
about the creation of a summer football league with Turner Sports
had been delayed until mid-December. But he acknowledged that the
league would begin play in May and end on Labor Day weekend with
the championship game. . . . The Yankees are not the only baseball
team that Charles Dolan, the chairman of Cablevision Systems, has
pursued. In 1980, he said Wednesday, he felt he had a deal to buy
the Chicago White Sox for $19 million, but lost out to Edward
DeBartolo Sr., whose bid was rejected by major league owners.
Eventually, a group led by Jerry Reinsdorf bought the team. &QL;

MALAYSIA TO BE UNLIKELY HOST FOR ECONOMIC MEETING 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ In little more than a week, the world's
leaders will converge on this businesslike city in the heart of
Southeast Asia for the annual meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum. They could hardly be meeting in a more
provocative place.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 1, Malaysia discontinued trading in its currency, the
ringgit, and imposed sweeping controls on the flow of capital in
its stock and currency markets, particularly on investment from
overseas. In doing so, the Malaysian prime minister, Mahathir
Mohamad, in effect slammed the door on the global economy that
President Clinton and the other leaders are coming here to
champion.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir's decision drew jeers from international investors and
policy- makers, who warned that Malaysia was seeking a quick fix
that would retard its desperately needed reforms and leave it the
odd man out when Asia finally recovered from the regional malaise.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, Mahathir's allies are marshaling new economic data
that they say indicate that capital controls are breathing new life
into the country's moribund economy. Malaysia's foreign reserves
rose strongly in September, and there is anecdotal evidence that
consumers are starting to spend again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to be able to say that since we adopted capital
controls, the economy has improved,'' said Zainal Aznam Yusof, the
deputy director of the Institute of Strategic and International
Studies, a research organization here that helped draft the
policies. ``But we want to see whether this is strongly
sustainable.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics said it was predictable that capital controls would be a
short-term tonic to Malaysia's economy. Because the country is
sheltered from the vagaries of capital flows and currency
fluctuations, they said, the government had been able to ease
interest rates and encourage consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the mere fact that Malaysia's experiment has yielded some
positive results guarantees that the issue will come up during the
APEC meeting. With Mahathir leading the campaign, the cause of
capital controls will have a fiery advocate who has a penchant for
getting under the skin of Westerners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mahathir is a very outspoken political leader,'' said Chia Yew
Boon, an independent analyst in Singapore. ``There is no way the
likes of Clinton or Jiang Zemin are going to be able to muzzle
him,'' he added, referring to President Jiang of China.
</P>
<P>
   Policy-makers in the United States have expressed fears that if
Malaysia's gambit is seen as successful, other economically
weakened countries in the region, like Indonesia, might be tempted
to try it. So far, Indonesian officials have said they would stick
to the recovery plan devised by the International Monetary Fund,
which stresses economic austerity and open markets.
</P>
<P>
   But officials in Japan have expressed some sympathy for
Mahathir's policies, while Paul Krugman, an economist at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has advocated using them as
an emergency measure.
</P>
<P>
   Yusof said recent events had vindicated Malaysia's contention
that it needed to insulate itself from the ravages of the global
financial system. He said the recent near-collapse of a prominent
American hedge fund underscored how sudden flows of capital can
have destructive consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund, based in Greenwich,
Conn., was nearly wrecked by a series of wrong bets on Treasury
securities after the collapse of the economy in Russia prompted a
flight of capital out of that country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The LTCM fiasco really provides a case study of what could go
wrong in the global economy,'' Yusof said.
</P>
<P>
   With capital controls as protection, Yusof said Malaysia was
picking up the pieces of its shattered economy. In addition to
growing foreign reserves, he said Malaysia had improved its trade
balance and revived consumer purchases of durable goods.
</P>

<P>
   Foreign investors have also not wholly abandoned Malaysia, as
experts had predicted they would. While foreign direct investment
fell in September _ to $142 million, from an average monthly rate
of $321 million for the period from January through September _ it
did not dry up completely.
</P>
<P>
   For every comforting statistic, though, the critics produce an
alarming one. They said the increase in Malaysia's foreign reserves
was merely due to the new capital restrictions, which stipulated
that Malaysian currency held outside the country would be worthless
unless repatriated by Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The skeptics also noted that bank lending declined in September,
despite several reductions in interest rates. So the consumers who
are buying new cars and home appliances are merely dipping into
their savings, which means the buying spree will end when their
savings are depleted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The argument was that by imposing capital controls, you'd
regain control over monetary policy, which would increase the
supply of money and lessen the liquidity crunch,'' said K.S. Jomo,
a professor of political economy at the University of Malaya here.
``But that's not happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest flaw in Malaysia's policy, Jomo and others said, is
its timing. With the Asian crisis more than a year old, much of the
foreign capital that was in the country has already gone. The
critics said Mahathir had spooked would-be investors without even
locking in the ones who used to be here.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a case to be made for the temporary imposition of
capital controls, but to avert a crisis, not to respond to one,''
Jomo said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, other Asian currencies, like the Indonesian rupiah and
the Thai baht, have actually rebounded since Malaysia suspended
trading in its currency and fixed the exchange rate at 3.8 ringgit
to the dollar. Analysts liken the situation to buying an insurance
policy for a disaster that has come and gone.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the capital controls are slowing down
much-needed corporate and banking reforms. The government's rescue
of Renong, a major conglomerate with close ties to Mahathir, is
going ahead, though some analysts predict the government will
eventually scrap the much-criticized plan.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue of politically connected companies remains a tense
issue here. On Monday, during the trial of Malaysia's former deputy
prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, on charges of corruption and
sex-related crimes, Anwar angrily denied Mahathir's claim that he
had approved the bailout.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar's sensational trial is a reminder that Mahathir's economic
policies cannot be disentangled from politics. Malaysia's
72-year-old prime minister clashed with his former protege over how
to respond to the Asian crisis, and he dismissed Anwar the day
after imposing capital controls.
</P>
<P>
   During boom times, Mahathir won support for his policies by
wrapping them in anti-foreigner language. In a speech on Monday, he
attacked a familiar target, saying foreign currency traders ``are
the cause of the currency turmoil,'' adding: ``They spread it
worldwide. They precipitated the current recession in every
country.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mahathir's treatment of Anwar has stirred anger and sparked
growing social unrest in Malaysia. With protesters chanting for
reform on the usually orderly streets of this city, experts said
Mahathir needed capital controls to work in order to soothe the
country's agitated population.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things will heat up if the economy does not improve,'' said
Chandra Muzaffar, a professor of political science at the
University of Malaya. ``Then the whole question of Mahathir and his
leadership will remain an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, at least, the leaders who converge on Kuala
Lumpur in two weeks will be able to identify with their embattled
host.
