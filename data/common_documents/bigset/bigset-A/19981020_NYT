PADRES HAND EXTINGUISHER TO HEALTHY HITCHCOCK 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ He didn't sneeze or wheeze and his throat wasn't
raspy.
</P>
<P>
   A healthy Sterling Hitchcock provided some relief to the San
Diego Padres' medical situation yesterday, arriving for the off-day
workout at Qualcomm Stadium without a handkerchief or clutching a
bottle of antihistamine.
</P>
<P>
   Sinus ailments hampered Padre pitchers Kevin Brown and Andy
Ashby in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically, I'm fine,'' Hitchcock said. ``I feel a little
congestion, but it's no big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock's health is better than the Padres' predicament.
</P>
<P>
   The National League champions are in a two-games-to-none bind
against the New York Yankees in the best-of-seven World Series. The
American League champions are two wins away from stamping
themselves as perhaps the best team in major league history.
</P>
<P>
   After watching the Yankees pound Padre pitching for 18 runs in
two games at Yankee Stadium and improve their overall record to
123-50 this season, Hitchcock reached an understandable conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can hit,'' he said. ``Bottom line, they can hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless Hitchcock, a one-time Yankee and former Mariner, can
continue his remarkable October and solve the Yankee hitters the
way he did against the Houston Astros and Atlanta Braves, going 3-0
with a 1.13 ERA, the Padres will find themselves looking at a
potential Series debacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has just been tremendous,'' Padres manager Bruce Bochy
said. ``To go against the pitchers he had to (Randy Johnson, Tom
Glavine and Greg Maddux in the NL playoffs) and do what he did, it
shows the mental makeup of this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   But can he do it one more time?
</P>
<P>
   Although Hitchcock understands the significance of Tuesday
night's Game 3 and the pressure that accompanies his first World
Series start, he downplayed the win-or-else scenario.
</P>
<P>
   He said there was more pressure just getting here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like going into any game saying it doesn't matter if
we win,'' he said. ``Obviously, I want to win every game I pitch,
and that's how I will approach this game. Basically, against
Houston and Atlanta I wanted to go out there and give us a chance
to be close.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was going to have to be pretty good to get by
Johnson, Maddux and Glavine. The same holds true (Tuesday) with
(David) Cone out there. I've got to try to limit my mistakes and
have some fun with it.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Yankees are having the most fun. But manager Joe
Torre hasn't clicked into the giddy stage and is wary of Hitchcock,
who was 9-7 during the regular season that began with him in the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I have noticed in Sterling Hitchcock is his command seems
to be better than what I remember, although I didn't manage him,''
Torre said. ``We played against him when he was with Seattle, and
he just seems to have better command of his stuff. I have been very
impressed with what he did in (the playoffs). He was getting ahead
in the count, and that's important for any pitcher to be able to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said that is his game plan: ``I'll try to throw
strikes, get ahead in the count and be aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   The left-hander said the fact his start is against the team that
drafted and developed him before trading him to the Mariners in
1996 isn't causing an adrenaline overflow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if we're playing the Bad New Bears right
now, it's the World Series. It's an opportunity to pitch in the
Series, and as a kid that's what you dream of.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees are making this a San Diego nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   After playing well in Game 1 and building a 5-2 lead going into
the seventh inning, the Padre relief corps collapsed during a
seven-run Yankee uprising that featured Tino Martinez's
game-winning grand slam. The Padres played miserably in Game 2,
falling seven runs behind by the third inning, and never
threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has survived all year on our pitching staff and
defense,'' Hitchcock said, ``and we've got to get back to throwing
the ball the way we're capable.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Dave Stewart concurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our pitching is better than it has shown,'' Stewart said. ``We
haven't pitched well at all, but it can turn around.''
</P>
<P>
   Having almost 65,000 rabid backers at the park should help the
Padres.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to be home,'' Bochy said, ``and this team has been
very resilient all season. We weren't celebrating by any means
(during the flight from New York). But this club doesn't get down,
and I'm proud of them that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, losing the first two games of the World Series creates
a difficult task. Of the 44 previous occasions when a team won the
first two games, 33 have won the Series.

RULING CLOUDS NBA TALKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ NBA players lost their best potential bargaining
chip in their labor standoff with the league Monday, when an
arbitrator ruled they do not have to be paid during the NBA
lockout.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by arbitrator John Feerick leaves the players without
the leverage they hoped would force NBA owners to call off the
lockout and offer a favorable contract.
</P>
<P>
   A ruling in the players' favor would have compelled the league
to pay $700 million in guaranteed contracts to 226 players _ among
them 10 Clippers and nine Lakers, including $15 million to
Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly eliminates a stumbling block we've had,'' deputy
commissioner Russ Granik said of the ruling, ``but it doesn't get
us any closer to an agreement if the players won't come to the
bargaining table.... It's not like we're gleeful here.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA's chief attorney called the ruling ``yet another defeat
for the union's strategy of litigation instead of negotiation.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, negotiating has taken a back seat to litigating. The
two sides have met just three times since owners declared the
lockout July 1, and progress has been minimal as the union awaited
Feerick's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Though a clear setback to the players' bargaining position,
union executive director Billy Hunter downplayed the effects of the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of expected it,'' he said. ``I was hoping... Feerick
would be inclined to see things our way, but we knew it would be a
giant leap for him to take, especially since he is a labor lawyer
by profession.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hunter insisted the players' resolve would not waver _ even
without five-, six- and seven-figure paychecks which were due to
begin arriving Nov. 15. The union has a strike fund of about $50
million for players who need it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you thought the guys were zealous about staying committed
to the cause,'' Hunter said, ``they're probably more rabid than
they were before.''
</P>
<P>
   The 111-day dispute has already wiped out training camps,
exhibition games and the first two weeks of the 1998-99 season.
More cancellations are likely to be announced next week. In the
meantime, no additional negotiating sessions are planned.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, players are meeting in Las Vegas on Thursday to discuss
bargaining strategy, and the NBA's board of governors is due to
meet next week.
</P>
<P>
   The union is hoping for attendance of at least 150 to 200
players, though the numbers may be considerably lower. Some players
feel detached from the process and say they are not being kept
informed.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Wizards forward Tracy Murray, a UCLA alumnus and
Pasadena native, was pessimistic in the wake of Feerick's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking we're not going to have a season now,'' he said.
``That's just my gut instinct because everyone is going to want to
play hardball. The owners don't have to negotiate with us now. They
won the ruling. They'll sit back and wait for us to break down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed. I think he (Feerick) just ruined
basketball with that. Now you're going to have people seriously
thinking about going overseas (to play).''
</P>
<P>
   Laker Robert Horry said Feerick's ruling was payback to the
owners for his previous ruling in favor of Warriors guard Latrell
Sprewell. Sprewell choked Warriors coach P.J. Carlesimo, and the
league voided his contract. Feerick reinstated it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You rule in favor of Spree, he was out of work so they had to
pay him,'' Horry said. ``Now they're doing a flip-flop. That's just
how the system is.''
</P>
<P>
   The players association is unlikely to appeal Feerick's ruling.
Its last legal redress could be decertification of the union, which
would allow players to sue the league in federal court. That
strategy has support from a vocal faction of player agents and
could be discussed in Las Vegas. The 19-member agents advisory
committee will meet Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   League officials expressed disappointment that the players would
be talking only with each other, rather than the league, this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Were missing games, we're losing our season,'' Granik said.
``I would hope that's sufficient pressure on both sides (to come to
the table).''
</P>
<P>
   Players and owners are battling over distribution of the
league's $2 billion in annual income. The league tore up the
existing agreement with the union because skyrocketing player
salaries pushed the players' share to 57 percent this season _ far
in excess of the 48 percent agreed on in the collective bargaining
agreement signed in 1995. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: PARCELLS PRESSING PSYCHOLOGICAL BUTTONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. _ Outside and inside Foxboro Stadium on Monday
night, the rivalry was there to be seen and heard. Seen in the
banner on U.S. 1 that growled, ``Grill the Tuna T-shirts.'' Heard
in the barbecue of boos for Bill Parcells as the Jets' coach
returned to where he coached the Patriots to the Super Bowl two
seasons ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a subplot, Curtis Martin, the Jets' $35 million running back,
was also returning to where he rumbled for 3,799 rushing yards in
three seasons as a Patriot.
</P>
<P>
   And the Patriots, perched in first place in the American
Football Conference East, were waiting. Reminded last week that
Parcells had suggested that maybe Coach Pete Carroll overworked
Martin last season, the Patriot coach blurted: ``Oh, that was the
biggest crock. Everything he says is a crock. You might as well
make a list. He's just full of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Told of Carroll's reaction, Parcells quietly replied, ``I don't
want to get involved in that.'' The Jets' professor of psychology
was having enough problems trying to press the buttons that would
get his team airborne in the divisional race.
</P>
<P>
   And with a 24-14 upset victory on Monday night, the Jets are now
3-3 for the season, and 3-0 in the division.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells' latest psych job was walking out of Friday's practice
in disgust before it was over. He took his coaching staff with him
and left the Jets players out there on the practice field for the
final hour of that day's rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Parcells has often been described as a coach who
``knew the right buttons to press.'' But with these Jets, sometimes
those buttons appear to be disconnected.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed that way when Parcells tried to press those
psychological buttons before the Jets' visit to St. Louis a week
ago Sunday. The Jets lost languidly, 30-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I attempted to do it, I think I know where I made a
mistake,'' the coach later confessed. ``I tried to call their
attention to certain things that weren't obvious by the Rams'
record. I was logical in my manner of thinking, but not effective
in the result. I do better with the team when I'm illogical.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaving players to practice by themselves on Friday is about as
illogical as a coach can get. But Parcells has done it before.
According to a Patriot historian, the Tuna they love to hate here
did it once in either his first or second season as the Patriots'
coach after taking over in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells' turbulent departure to the Jets ignited a rivalry that
Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe has described as ``almost like
the Yankees and Red Sox.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite. That baseball rivalry goes back nearly 80 years to
when the Red Sox dealt Babe Ruth to the Yankees, and it has
flourished ever since, especially when both teams are contenders.
But at least the Patriots are the first real rival, both
geographically and spiritually, that the Jets have ever had.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' natural rival should be the Giants, but the two teams
don't play each often enough.
</P>
<P>
   During the American Football League decade, the Oakland Raiders
emerged as the Jets' notorious rival: Ike Lassiter breaking Joe
Namath's cheekbone, the Raiders' 43-32 comeback in the ``Heidi''
game at Oakland, the 27-23 victory in the 1968 championship game at
Shea Stadium that put the Jets in Super Bowl III.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, only the Miami Dolphins, with Dan Marino, have
passed as an occasional remote rival, but only when Ken O'Brien was
the Jets' quarterback in their memorable shootouts.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, the Jets just haven't been good enough to stir a real
rivalry with anyone until Parcells returned to Foxboro early last
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets pushed that Sunday night game into overtime before
losing, 27-24, but later stung the Patriots, 24-19, in a Giants
Stadium rematch.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said that Monday night's appearance on ``Monday Night
Football'' was the start of something big _ a stretch of six games
that the coach figured would determine whether the Jets would be a
playoff contender or a playoff bust.
</P>
<P>
   After next Sunday's return to Giants Stadium against Dan Reeves'
Atlanta Falcons, the Jets go to Kansas City, return home against
the Buffalo Bills, then go to Indianapolis and Tennessee with a
mandate from their coach to perform.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're not successful in the next six weeks,'' Parcells
said, ``the ability to do what the objectives were would probably
be gone. I don't think you'll ever find in this league a team that
was any good that couldn't win games on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   And on Monday night, the Jets won a big game on the road.

U.S. EXPECTED TO BACK SHIFT IN INTERNET ADMINISTRATION
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By AMY HARMON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clearing the way for the global Internet to be governed without
governments, the Clinton administration is expected Tuesday to
commit itself to hand over the administration of the computer
network to a nonprofit corporation under a proposal that has won
broad support.
</P>
<P>
   Ira C. Magaziner, the adviser to President Clinton who has been
overseeing the contentious transition of what has traditionally
been a U.S. government function to the international private
sector, said the administration's endorsement would depend on the
adoption of certain amendments advocated in rival proposals.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is who will decide how to dole out names and addresses
like those with the suffixes ``.com'' and ``.net'' among
cyberspace's rapidly growing population, and who, if anyone, will
make money in the process.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the proposed organization is seen as a model for
policy making for a medium that crosses geographical as well as
socially constructed boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's long-awaited decision comes in the wake of
the death last week of the plan's key proponent, Jonathan Postel,
at age 55.
</P>
<P>
   Postel, who died of complications after undergoing heart
surgery, was one of the Internet's most revered technical wizards.
He had administered the infrastructure of the Internet address
system under a federal government contract since he invented it 30
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months he had sought to build a consensus beyond the
ranks of technologists to include corporate, nonprofit and
international interests in forming a new body that would make
policy decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Magaziner said the announcement, originally planned for Monday,
was delayed as he and Commerce Department staff members called
around to see if support for the new entity, known as the Internet
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or Icann, would hold
firm without Postel to lend his considerable credibility to the
project.
</P>
<P>
   But as electronic eulogies for Postel circulated over the
Internet, it seemed his coalition would remain intact, albeit with
some adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody anticipated this would happen, and Jon will be sorely
missed, but it underscores the necessity of making this
transition,'' Magaziner said. ``Part of the design was to move
beyond depending on the structure that was based on the Internet's
historical origins.''
</P>
<P>
   Obstacles to true consensus, however, remain.
</P>
<P>
   The California-based corporation proposed by Postel has been
criticized from several quarters for not providing a structure that
is democratic enough.
</P>
<P>
   Governments in Latin America and Africa, for example, complained
that their regions were not represented on the corporation's
proposed board.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals submitted to the Commerce Department by dissenting
international coalitions argued that the board should be held more
accountable to the Internet's diverse constituents and that proper
financial controls needed to be imposed.
</P>
<P>
   Network Solutions Inc. of Herndon, Va., which has distributed
domain names under an exclusive contract from the government for
the last five years and would see its monopoly end when the plan
goes into effect, has also objected to the Icann proposal. The
company generated revenue of $37 million in the first half of this
year by registering names with the ``.com,'' ``.net,'' ``.org'' and
``.edu'' suffixes.
</P>
<P>
   Magaziner said that the administration's consent to the Icann
proposal would hinge on its supporters' reaching an agreement with
those calling for a more open organization.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But he may also face opposition in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In letters to Magaziner and to Commerce Secretary William M.
Daley last week, Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., chairman of the
Commerce Committee, criticized what he called the ``closed door''
process initiated by Postel's group.
</P>
<P>
   Bliley suggested that the proposed board be made up of a
majority of U.S representatives and asked for an explanation of the
legal basis for turning over control to the new corporation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned about the manner in which the process of
privatizing the governance of the DNS has apparently unraveled,''
Bliley wrote. ``A loss of credibility in the Internet community at
large will seriously undermine the ability of the new corporation
to administer the Domain Name System and the stability of the
Internet itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Heath, chairman of the Internet Society, a nonprofit
coalition of the network's technical organizations, disputed
Bliley's version of the facts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me be blunt: it appears to me that his office might have
been misinformed if not manipulated by people who want to preserve
the status quo, and by that I mean a monopoly of Network
Solutions,'' Heath said. ``Jon never did anything behind closed
doors in his life.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Network Solutions said the company had had ``no
contact with Bliley.''

GROWING PAINS: NFL A RUDE AWAKENING FOR LEAF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The spiral begins behind the ear and zips through
the air like a laser-guided missile locked on its target.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice throw Ryan,'' San Diego Chargers interim head coach June
Jones yells out, trying to coax his 22-year-old prodigy back from
the depths of despair.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Leaf drops back again and lets another pass fly. Again and
again. Forty yards into the end zone. Over the middle. Into the
corner.
</P>
<P>
   With his $11.25 million signing bonus, a five-year, $31 million
contract and a new home in San Diego, the No. 2 player taken in
last spring's NFL draft still shows the natural ability with which
he led Washington State to its first Rose Bowl in 67 years.
</P>
<P>
   But on and off the field, the youngest quarterback to start an
NFL game since fellow ex-Cougar Drew Bledsoe in 1992 _ the Colts'
Peyton Manning is two months older _ is not the exultant young man
who threw a record 59 touchdown passes in his WSU career and made a
serious Heisman Trophy run.
</P>
<P>
   Going into last Sunday's game, Leaf was the NFL's lowest-rated
quarterback (29.8), having thrown 12 interceptions (three in one
game against the Raiders). He hadn't thrown for a touchdown in
25-plus quarters. What's more, his head coach, Kevin Gilbride, was
fired last week largely because of an inept Chargers offense run by
Leaf that contributed to a 2-4 start.
</P>
<P>
   Things settled down a bit Sunday with a shaky 13-10 victory over
Philadelphia. Now he is preparing to face a Seahawks defense prone
to rattling a young quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   On the outside, Leaf tries to shrug off his rude awakening to
NFL life.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a little strange, losing a head coach and all that,''
he said last week in an interview at Chargers headquarters. ``I
guess that's all in the business. I don't know much about it, but
I'm learning pretty quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also learning that fans can turn on him for what he does on
and off the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``CRYIN' RYAN''
</P>
<P>
   Sparked largely by his nationally televised, profanity-laden
tirade against a San Diego sports reporter, in addition to his poor
play, fans have begun to show their displeasure with the rookie.
When his public service announcement for the Make a Wish Foundation
was shown on the stadium video screen, it drew a round of boos.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Union-Tribune's ``Voice of the Fan'' weekly column
has become a flogging post for Leaf: ``Cryin' Ryan! What a shame.
Your mouth is bigger than your game. We should have drafted Brian
Griese,'' wrote Daniel Gray of Bonita.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf's first response was to stop talking to the media. Then he
switched to only ``yes and no'' answers. Now, he's just trying to
move on.
</P>
<P>
   He pretends not to hear the boos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not bothered at all,'' he said. ``It comes with the
business and it doesn't matter anyway. The fans are fickle
everywhere in the country, and you just have to play well. That's
the way it is and you find it out quickly in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   But it has bothered him enough that he doesn't want his family
to come from Great Falls, Mont., to see him play, and he doesn't
plan to stack Qualcomm Stadium with friends for this Sunday's game
with the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a long career in this league, you know,'' he said.
``They don't need to see the games where the crowd is booing you or
where you're struggling.''
</P>
<P>
   So now it is up to Leaf's coaches and teammates to rally around
him, hoping he can take that precision spiral from the practice
field to the playing field, where he has been abysmal in recent
weeks. Against the Raiders, he was only 7-of-18 for 78 yards and
was in danger of losing his job to backup Craig Whelihan.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Gilbride was fired and Jones, the team's
quarterbacks coach, was installed in his place by general manager
Bobby Beathard. Jones' first act was to give Leaf a vote of
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to play,'' said Jones, the former Atlanta Falcons
coach who has had plenty of experience tutoring another troubled
quarterback, Jeff George, and a young prodigy, Brett Favre, before
Favre went to Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be some games when he's probably going to
have to come out again. But at the same time, he understands that's
part of the growing process,'' Jones said. ``We've just got to
build him up and get him doing the job.''
</P>
<P>
   After so much was invested to get Leaf, the Chargers made a
statement that he, not Gilbride, is where the future lies, for
better or for worse.
</P>
<P>
   PATIENCE AND PENITENCE
</P>
<P>
   Even players like Whelihan, a fourth-year backup who started
seven games for the Chargers last year, are sympathetic and patient
with Leaf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially the last few weeks when he's been struggling, I've
been saying, `Slow it down a little bit. Don't aim the ball. Throw
the ball like you do during practice,''' Whelihan said on the
Chargers' pregame show on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just tell him he's going to be all right, because he's going
to be a good quarterback. He's just got to get through this rough
time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That so many care about his well-being is hard for Leaf to
accept, given his performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``My teammates are unbelievably supportive, which blows me away
because I'd probably be very upset with me,'' he said after the
loss to the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   He also is trying to make his peace with the media and Chargers
fans. After his eruption at the reporter, Leaf issued a statement
prompted by talks with his father that said he was being ``selfish
and I have let my personal shortcomings get in the way of my
professional behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Leaf said, ``It kind of feels like someone ripped my heart
out of me, I want to succeed so much.''
</P>
<P>
   To the fans, Leaf asks for understanding: ``I understand the
fans' reaction. They have a player coming in here that the team
gave so much up for. Everyone expects you to be a huge success, and
you go out and play so poorly. It's understandable. I'd be upset,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   With such mixed emotions, Leaf admits he is having a tough
education in the business of professional football. But he still
expects the world from his ability.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he felt about Jones' continuing to go with him as a
starter, Leaf still can muster his well-worn bravado: ``It's good
to have that, but that's what I expected. I expect to be the
starter. I was given the job and that's my role on this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he passed for only 83 yards (9-19) against
Philadelphia, he played the whole game and didn't fumble the ball
or throw an interception despite being sacked six times.
</P>
<P>
   LETTING LEAF GROW
</P>
<P>
   WSU coach Mike Price talks frequently with Leaf and has
counseled him through his troubled first season. He notes that Leaf
was raw and unbridled in his first years with the Cougars, just
like his first year in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at Ryan Leaf when he was young, he was not a
pretty-looking guy,'' Price said. ``I can remember going to the
Alamo Bowl (in 1994, Leaf's freshman year), and in practice he was
throwing the ball terrible. But he was saying, `Boy, I better get
my chance to start.' He was starting with the media then.''
</P>
<P>
   While Price doesn't make excuses for Leaf, he does dismiss the
blowup at the reporter as just one incident that happened to be
caught on video.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, he'll tell it like it is, and it explodes,'' Price
said. ``It's on tape, and they keep playing it again and again.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how Leaf can avoid similar problems in the future, Price
offers: ``I don't really know if there is anything other than not
blowing up at the media. Just relax and things will fall into place
eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   Price has not seen Leaf play in a Chargers regular-season game,
but he did visit him in preseason camp. Leaf looked as capable and
confident as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was throwing such a tight spiral. He really improved his
mechanics and throwing since he was a freshman,'' Price said.
</P>
<P>
   But Leaf needs more than a tight spiral to spark new life in the
Chargers offense. It could take weeks, maybe years.
</P>
<P>
   ``His growth at quarterback will determine how fast we can go,''
Jones said. ``We're going to try to do the base things that we know
he can do. Obviously, we have to be able to throw the football, and
we haven't thrown the football very well as of late.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jones is not sure exactly what Leaf can do, technically, to
bring him back to his collegiate confidence level and preseason
playing form. Leaf needs to learn how the pass routes run by
receivers adjust to NFL coverages, Jones suggests. He needs to know
when to take a sack and not force interceptions. He needs a
psychological boost as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing and experiencing successful games will start to breed
confidence,'' Jones said. ``That's what it's going to take at this
point. He's doing what most rookie quarterbacks do right now, and
that's not play very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Successful quarterbacks often don't have instant success, Jones
notes, listing veterans such as Steve Young, John Elway and Favre.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quarterbacks who have experience are the ones who are
successful,'' Jones said. ``You have to lose long enough to gain
that experience.''
</P>
<P>
   So in the absence of such experience, Price offers this
suggestion: ``I just think what he needs to do is have a little
more fun.''
</P>
<P>
   FOREVER A COUGAR
</P>
<P>
   Before the season began, Leaf posed for an ESPN Magazine photo
shoot in scuba gear throwing a football underwater. But he has yet
to become immersed in the Southern California lifestyle and claims
not to have much time to enjoy his newfound wealth or his house
near the beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live here (at the Chargers practice facility) and I live in
my house. The weather is beautiful, and that's about it. I don't
have any time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also has abandoned Great Falls as the place he calls home.
Reminded that he once contemplated building a new football field in
Great Falls, Leaf claims, ``I never said that. No. I can't remember
ever saying that.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Pullman and Eastern Washington are where he considers
himself at home, and he plans a brief return Oct. 31 during the
Chargers' bye week to donate an as-yet undisclosed amount of money
to WSU when the Cougars host Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   A true Cougar at heart, Leaf still has sharp-tongued disdain for
the University of Washington, and Seattle in general.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would be inviting a large group of friends and
family to watch him in the Kingdome when the Chargers return to
Seattle Dec. 13, Leaf was blunt: ``I really don't have any friends
or family in Seattle. That's the bad part of the state, where the
Huskies roam.''
</P>
<P>
   With the tense few weeks behind him, Leaf seems most relaxed
when conversation turns to the Cougars' future. According to Leaf,
that future soon will lie in the hands of his first cousin, Matt
Kegel of Havre, Mont., who has committed to play quarterback at WSU
next year. Kegel, rated the No. 12 quarterback prospect in the
country by SuperPrep magazine, also was recruited by the Huskies,
but Leaf had a subtle way of letting his cousin know what the
choice should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day he was wearing a Husky hat, and I tore it apart and
said a bunch of disgusting things to it,'' Leaf said with a devious
smile.
</P>
<P>
   Like his cocky cousin, the 6-foot-5, 205-pound Kegel already has
declared that he intends to take the Cougars to the Rose Bowl _
only he plans to win it. And Leaf wouldn't be surprised if he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's better than me coming out of high school,'' Leaf says.
``He's a lot more fundamentally sound than I was. He's the real
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his flaws and the rookie mistakes, the Chargers are
betting that Leaf and his fabulous spiral are the real deal, too.
They were even willing to change coaches in mid-season to give him
plenty of room to grow.

FROM BIG TO BIGGER FOR NORTHRIDGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHRIDGE, Calif. _ Before last weekend, it was a big game.
Scratch that now because Montana State and Cal State Northridge
both lost.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's meeting has become huge. Gargantuan. Perhaps the
biggest in CSUN's football existence. At the least, the biggest
since moving to NCAA Division I-AA in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it this way: One season will be nearly destroyed
Saturday. Another will be kept alive.
</P>
<P>
   It leaves no time for CSUN (4-2, 3-1 Big Sky) to reflect on a
dismal 35-21 loss to Sacramento State, while Montana State (4-2,
2-1) must rid itself of evil thoughts emanating from a 34-31 loss
to Portland State.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a perfect world, if we both won we could have both made the
postseason,'' CSUN coach Ron Ponciano said. ``Right now, it's not
going to be both of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, two teams from the Big Sky Conference reach the
playoffs, and that should still stand true.
</P>
<P>
   However, with nearly half the schedule remaining, and a pair of
difficult road trips awaiting each team, rebounding from a second
consecutive loss could be too much. Montana State still has games
at Eastern Washington and Montana while CSUN plays at Weber State
and Southwest Missouri State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the losses did anything to change the importance
of this game,'' Montana State coach Cliff Hysell said. ``We have
four huge games left, and so does Northridge. This is a big game
coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   Still ranked, but barely: CSUN survived for another week in the
polls, but barely. The Matadors slid eight spots in the Sports
Network poll to 24th and nine slots to 25th in the USA Today
coaches' poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like we were content with being 16th,'' said
Ponciano, who gave his team Sunday and Monday off. ``We spent five
hours watching film of the Sac State game. I think it was important
as a staff that we looked at reality. We needed some time, and
those kids needed time away from us.''
</P>
<P>
   Montana State, ranked 18th in both polls last week, is ranked
24th by the coaches but not ranked by the Sports Network.
</P>
<P>
   The never-ending story: Another day, another offensive line
crisis. Ponciano said center Julio Alcala, who left the team last
Sunday because of personal problems, is expected back Wednesday.
Meanwhile his replacement, Beau Cherry (ankle), and left tackle
Mike Barnes (shoulder) both could miss the Montana State game.
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano said he will shift tight end Ryan Schatz to left tackle
and use Joe Bergman as a backup. The Matadors haven't started the
same offensive line in back-to-back games this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just no more people. The bodies have run out,''
Ponciano said. ``It's to the point now where it's beyond
frustrating. We're trying to make a run at the league title and
it's something different every week.''

U.S. MAY SEEK TO CHALLENGE EAST GERMAN MEDALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Olympic Committee is preparing for a controversial
process that seeks to upgrade medals for American athletes who lost
to East Germans in cases where the use of performance-enhancing
drugs can be documented.
</P>
<P>
   The first request could be made within the next several weeks,
and involves seeking a gold medal for American women who finished
second to East Germany in the 400-meter medley relay at the 1976
Summer Games in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, documents and testimony have
established what had been long suspected: a state-sponsored system
of performance-enhancing drug use that existed in the former East
Germany from 1968 to 1988 and that may have involved 10,000
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   After first saying that it could not rewrite history, the
International Olympic Committee said earlier this year that it
would consider adjusting results on a case by case basis.
</P>
<P>
   Urged on by athletes who felt they were cheated out of medals,
the U.S. Olympic Committee has begun preparations to challenge East
German results, particularly in swimming, where 50 possible cases
could come under scrutiny, Bill Hybl, president of the committee,
said.
</P>
<P>
   The USOC has got ammunition for its challenges from trials this
year in Germany in which a former East German doctor and a swimming
coach admitted giving performance-enhancing drugs to young female
swimmers, were convicted of causing bodily harm and were fined
about $4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Hybl said in an interview that challenges would be made only in
cases where there was an admittance of drug use or a conviction in
court.
</P>
<P>
   The USOC would not seek to take medals away from East Germans,
Hybl said, but would seek to give Americans ``appropriate
recognition'' for their achievements. This means seeking to give an
American a duplicate gold medal if he or she had won a silver or to
have an asterisk placed by the result of a particular race.
</P>
<P>
   The first case that may be challenged involved the 400-meter
medley relay in Montreal, where the East German team of Ulrike
Richter, Hannelore Anke, Andrea Pollack and Kornelia Ender defeated
an American team of Linda Jezek, Lauri Siering, Camille Wright and
Shirley Babashoff.
</P>
<P>
   Rolf Glaeser, a former East German coach, admitted in court last
summer that he had given Pollack and other swimmers
performance-enhancing drugs. The USOC is awaiting a German judge's
written decision in which Glaeser was convicted last summer of
causing bodily harm to swimmers. Once that decision is received,
perhaps within the next two or three weeks, Hybl said that the USOC
might use the medley relay as the first case in challenging the
East German swimming dominance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want our gold medal,'' said Wendy Boglioli, an alternate on
the American relay team, who also won a bronze medal behind Ender
and Pollack in the 100-meter butterfly in Montreal. ``We deserve to
have that in the record books.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Labor negotiations are built on a foundation of give and take, and
it was NBA owners who did all the taking Monday afternoon.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In what represents the biggest victory yet in a 112-day labor
battle between the league and the National Basketball Players
Association, arbitrator John Feerick sided with NBA owners in a
grievance filed by the union.
</P>
<P>
   And it's what the owners don't have to give _ money to 226
players with guaranteed contracts _ that represents what might be
the final blow to the Players Association.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the players' union were not happy with the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's garbage,'' said Denver's Nick Van Exel. ``That's what
we're looking at. You put anybody in that position, with a
guaranteed contract, and the owner locks you out, you get paid. We
had a legitimate argument. There's no way that should go against
us.''
</P>
<P>
   But it did.
</P>
<P>
   Arbitrating what he termed a ``novel and difficult'' issue,
Feerick, dean of Fordham Law School, ruled that the ``salary
provisions of the player contracts are not effective or operative
during a lawful lockout.''
</P>
<P>
   With that decision, the biggest bargaining chip in the
increasingly acrimonious negotiations goes to the owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased with the arbitrator's ruling,'' said Jeffrey
Mishkin, the NBA's chief legal officer. ``Unfortunately, it does
not get us any closer to a deal with the union's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only negotiations will end our current impasse and lead to a
settlement of our dispute. This is yet another defeat for the
union's strategy of litigation instead of negotiation.''
</P>
<P>
   But little negotiation is expected in the coming days. The
players are heading to Las Vegas, where the union's next step will
be hammered out in a Thursday summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   League commissioner David Stern would have preferred the players
were heading to the bargaining table instead. The lockout already
has caused the NBA to lose the first two weeks of the regular
season, 99 games in all, and Stern and deputy commissioner Russ
Granik said the cancellation of more games was ``inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, for us, we're glad to have the ruling that we got
today,'' Granik said. ``It certainly eliminates a stumbling block
that we've had as we've tried to bargain, but the fact is it
doesn't get us any closer to an agreement if the players won't come
to the bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, as I said, it removes a stumbling block, but it's not like
we're gleeful here, because as each day goes by we're missing more
and more games.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a league that had never lost a game to a work stoppage
in its 51-year history could be inching closer to losing an entire
season.
</P>
<P>
   Union executive director Billy Hunter hinted that the two sides
appear to be headed toward disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find ourselves to be in the same position as we were in
(Sunday),'' Hunter said of the players. ``The players are not
inclined to back down. As soon as the owners realize this and end
the lockout, the better chance we have to avoid enormous damage to
the sport of professional basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Exel confirmed that the players aren't about to give an
inch, saying Monday's ruling probably won't speed up the bargaining
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it doesn't speed up our end, unless it's for a deal
everyone can agree on,'' Van Exel said. ``I hope we stand by each
other and battle it out.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle, of course, is over money. Lots of money.
</P>
<P>
   Owners, eyeing skyrocketing player salaries, imposed the lockout
effective July 1 and hope to address the Larry Bird exception to
the salary cap, which allows teams to spend any amount of money to
re-sign their own free agents, regardless of the cap. While the two
sides have been discussing a ``luxury tax'' on Bird-exception
salaries, they remain far apart in their negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The union had argued that players should have been paid during
the lockout, saying owners should have included lockout-protection
language in individual player contracts.
</P>
<P>
   They pointed to Olden Polynice's contract with the Sacramento
Kings, which contains a clause that says he won't be paid during a
lockout. The union contended that other owners should have done the
same.
</P>
<P>
   The union filed the grievance just hours before the lockout was
imposed July 1, and even though Feerick's jurisdiction expired
along with the collective-bargaining agreement, he ruled the union
had beaten the deadline and he was entitled to hear the case.
</P>
<P>
   What now?
</P>
<P>
   Players who were expecting a paycheck Nov. 15 will instead have
to wait until they set foot on the court to get paid. And even
though Hunter still insists players will receive their full
salaries should the season get under way, Stern and Granik said
that was not the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has already been decided, and unless they have some means
by which they think they can appeal it, which would surprise me,
that issue is over,'' Granik said. ``I don't ever see the owners
agreeing to pay for games where they lost the revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't even make any sense to me, and I don't understand
where that is coming from and on what basis he (Hunter) thinks that
would ever be attainable. These dollars have been lost. I think by
now the players have lost well over $100 million in salaries just
on the games that have been canceled.''
</P>
<P>
   With more to come.
</P>
<P>
   Before Feerick announced his decision, Stern sent a letter to
Hunter that he hoped would spur negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   It contained three proposals to address the salary structure:
</P>
<P>
   An NFL-style hard salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   An escrow account from which players would receive money if
their salaries fell below a certain percentage of the
basketball-related income, or from which owners would receive
payments from the players if salaries were above that percentage.
</P>
<P>
   And the luxury tax.
</P>
<P>
   Stern insisted the NBA was more interested in working with the
players rather than smashing the union.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this notion that's been let out there that the owners
are suddenly here with a strategy trying to make the players
cave,'' Stern said. ``This is not about getting the players to
cave.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason the owners reopened the agreement is that they
couldn't operate under the expired system. And they recognized the
risk that reopening posed, but they were prepared to take the
risk.''

AFTER 24 YEARS, A FOUNDATION FINDS A LOT TO CELEBRATE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By LENA WILLIAMS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was a snapshot for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   There was Venus Lacy, the 6-foot-4-inch center of the American
Basketball League's Nashville Noise, with an arm draped around the
5-1 Michelle Kwan, the 1998 Olympic silver medalist in figure
skating.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Joyner-Kersee, the two-time Olympic decathlon winner,
took one look at that pair and wiggled into the frame. Then former
Olympic swimmer Donna de Varona, who helped establish the Women's
Sports Foundation 24 years ago, and thus was partly responsible for
this gathering, was coaxed into the shot.
</P>
<P>
   Together they were a pictorial history of women in sports _
past, present and future. The celebratory moment came Monday at a
news conference in Manhattan as the foundation announced its award
winners and inducted four women into its International Sports Hall
of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Kwan was named sportswoman of the year in an individual sport.
Cynthia Cooper, who plays for the Houston Comets and was the
Women's National Basketball Association's most valuable player for
the second consecutive year, was named sportswoman of the year in a
team sport.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Hall of Fame inductees was the late Florence Griffith
Joyner, who won three gold medals at the 1988 Olympics. She died
last month at age 38. Also inducted was Shirley Strickland de la
Hunty, an Australian hurdler, who in 1952 and 1956 became the first
woman to win track and field gold medals in successive Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never imagined being in the same room with so many talented
athletes,'' de la Hunty said.
</P>
<P>
   The third inductee was Margaret Osborne duPont, who won 37 Grand
Slam tennis titles from 1946 to 1962, including three consecutive
U.S. Open singles titles and singles titles at the French Open in
1946 and at Wimbledon in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Named to the Hall of Fame in the coaching category was Tara
VanDerveer, who has guided Stanford's women's basketball team to
two National Collegiate Athletic Association titles and led the
1996 U.S. Olympic team to a gold medal. All the winners and
inductees were honored at a foundation dinner at the
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The most poignant moment of Tuesday's news conference was
provided by Al Joyner, Griffith Joyner's widower. He said he made
the trip from Los Angeles to be among those Griffith Joyner most
revered: her fellow female athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``She always felt that women were the best between male and
female because, she said, she proved that to me every day,'' Joyner
said to more than 50 athletes seated before him. ``She had been
looking forward to attending the awards dinner because she believed
in the things the sports foundation was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit foundation, which Billie Jean King established
with de Varona, has grown in stature, prestige and mandate since
its modest beginning as an organization dedicated to increase
opportunities for women in sports and fitness. Last year it handed
out more than 700 grants totaling more than $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1992 the foundation gave me funds for travel and clothes to
compete,'' Kwan said. ``Figure skating is a very expensive sport,
and I'm not sure I would be where I am today were it not for the
support of this foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, King chipped and charged her way into tennis history by
defeating Bobby Riggs in an exhibition match billed as the Battle
of the Sexes. The victory shattered long-held perceptions of
women's roles in sports, and provided the impetus for the
organization that has now become a part of King's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot has happened since then, but our battle isn't over,''
said Dr. Linda Bunker, an instructor at the University of Virginia
and this year's recipient of the Billie Jean King Contribution
Award for her research on women and athletics. ``The foundation is
not only doing the right thing, but doing things right for women in
sports.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wilma Rudolph Courage Award was given to Willye White, who
overcame segregation in her hometown of Greenwood, Miss., to win a
silver medal in the long jump at the 1956 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   White, who as a girl picked cotton and now coaches children in
Chicago, said she had to pinch herself to make sure this new
chapter of her life was real. In case her mind was deceiving her,
she brought along a disposable camera to capture it.

TESTAVERDE IS IN CHARGE, HELPING THE JETS GET EVEN
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. _ The New York Jets may have found themselves a
quarterback while finding themselves Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Vinny Testaverde muscled and feathered three touchdown passes in
a 24-14 upset of the first-place New England Patriots. Instead of
having the season close in on them, the Jets (3-3) pulled back up
to .500, and a favorable position in the American Football
Conference East. They are now a game behind both New England and
Miami, who have each won four games and lost two.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde's final touchdown pass was a 43-yard bullet to a
streaking Dedric Ward with 3 minutes, 29 seconds remaining. It
proved to be the crushing score. Earlier in the period, he teamed
with Kyle Brady to put the Jets ahead by 17-14. It was Brady's
second score of the game, and the first time in his career that he
caught two touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
   Brady's first touchdown was positioned by Aaron Glenn's end-zone
interception of the Patriots' Drew Bledsoe, whose pass was meant
for Shawn Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   The victory came eight days after the Jets committed five
turnovers in losing to the St. Louis Rams, a desultory performance
that led Coach Bill Parcells to bench Glenn Foley in favor of the
34-year-old Testaverde.
</P>
<P>
   Now 3-0 as a Jets starter after leading New York in the team's
return to ``Monday Night Football,'' Testaverde again had the
benefit of a 100-yard performance by Curtis Martin, who along with
Parcells was making another return to New England, their former
team.
</P>
<P>
   It was slightly less mad than last year's return, although in
some quarters it was referred to as World War Tuna, a reference to
Parcells' nickname. Still, the opening half produced dramatics and
theatrics.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots took a 14-10 lead at halftime, but it was not easy,
and the crowd often alternated between sullen disbelief and wild
excitement.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets opened the scoring in the first quarter when Brady
barely made it to the goal line cradling Testaverde's 1-yard pass.
On the drive, Testaverde made a critical connection with Keyshawn
Johnson. On third-and-6, Testaverde rolled to his right and left
his feet, leaping to get the ball over the defense to Johnson for a
20-yard gain.
</P>
<P>
   Near the goal line, Testaverde again showed his experience. He
improvised as he was rushed, rolled out, moved in and out of the
pocket while his receivers seemingly were covered, and then calmly
searched for someone _ and found Brady, his safety valve.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots quickly retaliated with a 76-yard scoring drive
capped by a 1-yard run by rookie Robert Edwards, who now has scored
a touchdown in his first six games, tying a rookie record shared by
Alan Ameche and Joe Cribbs.
</P>
<P>
   It is very likely that many in the Foxboro Stadium crowd were
keeping track of the running backs' yardage. Martin had left New
England for the lure of New York money and the chance to be
reunited with his former coaches. As part of the deal that allowed
him to become a Jet, the Patriots received the Jets' first-round
pick. With it, they snared Edwards, who played at Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde led another Jet drive in the second quarter,
featuring a 14-yard run by Martin that brought them close enough
for a 38-yard field-goal attempt by John Hall. But Hall's attempt
was blocked by Chad Eaton, the third time this season a Jets kick
has been blocked.
</P>
<P>
   This one started a Patriot scoring drive that consumed 77 yards.
Bledsoe gave the Patriots a 14-7 lead by connecting with tight end
Lovett Purnell for 6 yards.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jets closed out the half with Testaverde and Johnson
again collaborating on a big third-down play to keep a drive going.
This one went for 29 yards on a third-and-10. With six seconds
left, the Jets got to the 5. Johnson headed for the end zone, and
Testaverde attempted a high pass over Ty Law. But Johnson could not
control the pass as he jostled with Law. Hall came on to kick a
23-yard field goal.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This rivalry has taken on an urgency and importance since
Parcells took over the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, most great sports rivalries have not only a little age on
them, but also a tradition of teams knocking each other off. This
has not been the history here.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, the Jets and the Patriots have not been good at the
same time, and there have been few memorable games between them.
They have met only once in post-season play, in a 1985 AFC
wild-card game at the Meadowlands. The Patriots won, 26-14.
</P>
<P>
   This has become a rivalry defined by loss and desertion:
Parcells, now joined by Martin, returning to the scene of past
success. Now they are intruders instead of icons.
</P>
<P>
   Only two years ago, Parcells was coaching the Patriots en route
to a Super Bowl appearance, and Martin was doing the running.
Martin was in his second year, was headed for the Pro Bowl and was
respected for his graciousness and team spirit. Although Parcells
took over the Jets last season, Martin was still here, in his third
season, his career stretching into the new millennium a likelihood.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Bledsoe seemed almost consumed by facing his former
coach. He played erratically, and even earned an unsportsmanlike
penalty for his tirade against Jets safety Victor Green. Even Coach
Pete Carroll, who was in his first year with the Patriots last
season, said the Parcells legacy was monumental to overcome, and
distracting. The clubs faced each other in a Sunday night game here
last season. It was the Jets' only prime-time appearance all year,
and it went into a dramatic overtime before the Patriots won.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Bledsoe and Carroll were more understated, as
if they each have survived the post-Parcells comparisons, and
thrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not near the same situation it was last year,'' Bledsoe
said. ``There's only one first time.''

SCOUTS MAKE CAL'S McLAUGHLIN NERVOUS 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY _ Ssssshhh! An NFL scout is at practice, on the
sideline. Don't let John McLaughlin know. He hates when they come
to see him.
</P>
<P>
   Games in front of 60,000 or so hostile strangers who would love
nothing more than to see him get pancaked, or juked by a running
back, don't faze him.
</P>
<P>
   When an NFL scout stops by a Cal practice to check out a
late-blooming senior defensive end with linebacker speed, now
that's worrisome. McLaughlin, a Hart High graduate, is that player.
And the thought of being on display in practice makes him a little
queasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me nervous when they're here,'' said McLaughlin, a
former Daily News All-Area pick who lines up against No.2 UCLA at
Cal's Memorial Stadium on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand why they're here,'' McLaughlin said. ``I
don't think I'm that good of a football player.''
</P>
<P>
   But a lot of others believe McLaughlin is that kind of player.
His position coach, Bill Dutton, loves to add to McLaughlin's
frenetic feeling. Any time a scout pops by, including last
Thursday, Dutton makes it a point to tell McLaughlin as he dresses
for practice. And, boy, does McLaughlin despise that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting because before a game he's really poised,''
Dutton said. ``I tell him (about scouts) and he gets really
nervous. I tell him because if I was in his position, it would
motivate me to play harder knowing a scout was there to see me.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's John. He's a strong, fast, active athlete. But
sometimes he can be his own worst enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't get this relationship wrong. Dutton and McLaughlin get
along fine. It's just that Dutton is trying to boost McLaughlin's
self-esteem as a football player because success, and being a
high-profile player, is new.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago McLaughlin, moved from linebacker to the rush end
position for Cal, was trying to get used to the Golden Bears' way
of doing things after transferring from Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   And a year ago he weighed 220, at best. Now his 6-foot-4 frame
checks in at 242 pounds and his speed is better. He covers 40 yards
in 4.5 seconds, but more will be made of that during the NFL
combines this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scouts are very intrigued by his combination of speed and
size,'' said Cal head coach Tom Holmoe, himself a local product
(Crescenta Valley) and an NFL veteran. ``John is very disciplined,
great speed pass-rusher and does a great job on special teams.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason for McLaughlin's metamorphosis was the heavy stuff.
The weights. It seems that even at storied Notre Dame, the coaching
staff couldn't get McLaughlin within a Hail Mary of the weight
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always hated it, but as soon as you start lifting a
little bit, get a little size on you and some strength, it feels
good,'' McLaughlin said. ``It becomes kind of addicting. Once you
get stronger, you like that feeling. You keep working on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gained speed because I never had any muscle in my legs. I
didn't have any power in my legs.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem Cal had earlier this season was keeping McLaughlin
fresh. Not because he lacked endurance but because he didn't get
rest during a game. Not only does he start on the defensive line,
but he's on the kick-return team, the kick-coverage team and lines
up on the outside on punt coverage. Yes, a defensive lineman on the
outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could be just like a Billy Bates kind of player,'' another
NFL scout said. ``He'd be perfect for a team like the Minnesota
Vikings where they let their defensive linemen move around.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin has 17 tackles, five of which are for a loss, and two
sacks.
</P>
<P>
   Early projections have McLaughlin, a relative unknown until
spring ball in college circles, going in the later rounds of the
NFL draft. Obviously, that could change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll do anything they want me to do to play in the NFL,''
McLaughlin said. ``I'll be the damn water boy.''
</P>
<P>
   But McLaughlin's got to go now. Between practice, slight anxiety
attacks and position meetings, he has to talk to a scout. It's a
guy from the New York Giants, which also happens to be McLaughlin's
favorite team.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, by the way. As it turns out, McLaughlin already knew a scout
was at practice....

TESTAVERDE IS THE ANSWER, FOR THE TIME BEING
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. _ While walking onto the practice field one day
late last week, Jets Coach Bill Parcells, in that loud, raspy voice
of his, said something to quarterback Vinny Testaverde that shocked
a small group of Jets players accustomed to shocking Parcells
statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vinny,'' several of the players recalled the coach saying,
``you're my quarterback for the rest of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't exactly what Parcells said that had the players
shaking their heads, it was the timing. Standing 5 feet behind
Testaverde was Glenn Foley, the former starter and now the backup.
There was no question in the minds of the players that Parcells
made the statement strictly to agitate Foley.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells' words may have been accurate, even if they were meant
to tweak Foley. Testaverde's excellent performance in Monday
night's 24-14 victory over New England gives him the job, probably
for the rest of the year. Parcells may have flip-flopped his
quarterbacks more than a stack of blueberry pancakes, but the wheel
has stopped on Testaverde for the near future. Congratulations,
Vinny, just watch your back. Ask Foley.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, what does Testaverde do with his new position,
and what does it mean for the Jets' future?
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde played well against New England. His throws were
sharp, and at times his command of the offense was outstanding. He
took two tough hits in the third quarter and got up immediately,
seemingly wanting to use national television as a stage to counter
the talk that he is a soft player. He scrambled well to buy time.
And Testaverde saved the Jets' season by leading the team to a
victory. Overall, he was great on one of the biggest stages in
football.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the problem. What happened Monday night was
encouraging for the immediate future, for this month and this
season. But eventually Parcells must decide if Testaverde is the
man who can lead the Jets to a Super Bowl. Is his good play this
season a sign that Testaverde has shed the inconsistency of his
career, or just a mirage, with the erratic Testaverde waiting just
around the corner ready to pop off his mask in time for Halloween?
</P>
<P>
   Is Testaverde the answer? Can a player whose record as a starter
is 51-83 in 12 years get the Jets to a Super Bowl? Testaverde
deserves a break because he has played on some bad teams, but there
are very few people in the National Football League who believe
that Testaverde, at age 34, can still win a championship. But
against a top-notch Patriots defense, he looked like a champion. He
may be poised to prove people wrong in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   It was uncanny how well he played. The Patriots threw body after
body into his face, and Testaverde would calmly sidestep the pass
rush and throw a dart. Late in the game, Testaverde tossed a
43-yard pass to Dedric Ward to seal the game. He finished 22 of 32
with 3 touchdowns. He got practically every receiver involved in
the offense, especially Keyshawn Johnson, who had 4 catches for 78
yards.
</P>
<P>
   What this means for Foley is that he is the loser in the Jets'
quarterback derby. Foley is 1-7 as a starter, and his great game
against San Francisco earlier this season seems like an eternity
ago. Foley may be good, but the only thing anyone can go by is his
record.
</P>
<P>
   What also hurts Foley is that his relationship with Parcells has
reached rock bottom. The trip there started when, according to
several Jets players, Parcells and Foley got into a loud,
expletive-filled argument this month, with Foley protesting how
Parcells has put him on the quarterback merry-go-round.
</P>
<P>
   Foley is not a selfish person, so he hasn't tried to sabotage
Testaverde in the locker room in any way like some backups do.
After the Jets' first series against the Patriots, in which
Testaverde took the offense 56 yards in eight plays for a
touchdown, Foley was the first to congratulate him on the sideline.
When speaking to the media, Foley is mostly upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   But teammates say Foley is bitter about his situation. He
constantly complains to them about Parcells and wonders what his
future is with the Jets, they say.
</P>
<P>
   The future of the position as a whole, despite Testaverde's
great game, is in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Once the season is over, the Jets will still probably explore
the free-agent market, which is easier said than done. The choices
are thin, filled with land mines like Kerry Collins and Scott
Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Parcells gambles and sticks with Testaverde, and the two
make a Super Bowl run together next year. It would be a risk,
asking an aging quarterback to lead your team, but Parcells has
never been someone shy about playing poker. And right now,
Testaverde may be the best bet he has.

LAWRENCE TAYLOR ARRESTED IN FLORIDA ON DRUG CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lawrence Taylor hasn't tackled anyone in five years, but one
thing has stayed the same for the former Giants All-Pro linebacker:
He hasn't avoided drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in three years, Taylor was arrested at a
hotel room and charged with possession of crack cocaine. His latest
arrest occurred Monday morning in Florida, where Taylor had gone to
play in a celebrity golf tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said he was prodded repeatedly by an undercover police
officer to buy the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time a law enforcement agency can solicit you all day and
you tell them no and then they have the nerve to come to my room at
2 a.m. and try to sell me drugs,'' Taylor told The Associated Press
as he left the Pinellas County Jail after posting $15,500 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Admitting that he had done some bad things at other times in his
life, Taylor said, ``I'm just waiting for my day in court.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, 39, was arrested at 2 a.m. Monday by the St. Petersburg
Beach, Fla., police's special response team and charged with buying
three pieces of crack cocaine for $50 from an undercover officer.
He also faces a misdemeanor charge of possession of drug
paraphernalia in his hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   According to the police, Taylor was ``found in possession of
numerous pieces of crack cocaine, smoking devices and utensils.''
The police say Taylor admitted his knowledge of the drug
paraphernalia's presence, after they arrested him in Room 509 of
the Sandpiper Resort.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, it's only an accusation,'' said Thomas Melani,
a New Jersey-based lawyer for Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Charged with Taylor was Victoria Corey, 41, an employee of
Taylor L.T. Enterprises, which Taylor owns.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who lives in Upper Saddle River, N.J., was last arrested
on May 3, 1996, at a celebrity golf tournament in Myrtle Beach,
S.C. According to the police, Taylor tried to buy $100 worth of
crack cocaine from undercover agents. He resolved the case by
enrolling in a pretrial intervention program that would wipe out
the charges after he served 60 hours of community service and
submitted to drug counseling and random drug testing.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor underwent rehabilitation for cocaine use in 1986. In 1988
he was suspended for the first four games of the season for
violating the NFL's substance abuse policy for a second time. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   George Young, a National Football League executive who was
formerly the New York Giants general manager who drafted Taylor,
said he was ``deeply saddened'' to hear of Taylor's plight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Giants have tried to do the best they could to help him,''
Young said. ``They tried to help him help himself. Wellington Mara
and Bob Tisch have been very sensitive to that,'' Young said,
referring to the Giants' owners. ``They've helped him at different
times, including since he retired. They certainly haven't abandoned
him. Wellington is on top of that because he cares.''
</P>
<P>
   Young paused and added, ``I know some of his former teammates
have been worried about him, too. Harry Carson, about a month ago,
told me he was concerned about him. George Martin, too. It's a
great sadness.''

PADRES READY FOR FAMILIAR SCENERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The forecast for San Diego today calls for blue
skies and sunshine, gentle breezes and 65,000 screaming fans at
Qualcomm Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   After getting mugged in the Bronx, the San Diego Padres are
clinging to the belief that a change of coasts will do wonders for
their endangered World Series hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our morale is fine,'' outfielder Tony Gwynn said Monday as the
Padres worked out at their home park in preparation for Game 3
tonight against the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still confident we can do some things that will give us
a chance to win,'' Gwynn said. ``Coming home is a lot easier. I
know I feel comfortable in my own home, in my own bed, driving my
own car. Especially as opposed to New York, where I don't know
where the hell I'm going.''
</P>
<P>
   His teammates were just as lost, as the Padres went down in the
first two games against the Yankees who, after 114 regular-season
victories and nine more in 11 playoff games, appear invincible.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres blew a 5-2 seventh-inning lead in the first game and
lost, 9-6. Then, they were thoroughly outclassed, 9-3, in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating,'' third baseman Ken Caminiti said. ``We can
be happy just being here, or we can go do something about it. I'm
not content to be here. I want to win this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres know history is against them, just as it was against
the Braves when San Diego won the first three games of the National
League Championship Series. The Padres are the 45th team to lose
the first two games of a World Series. Of the previous 44, only 11
came back to win it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thinking about the (11) who came back,'' manager Bruce
Bochy said. ``That's all we can do. This club has done a good job
handling adversity all year, and that's what we have to do now.
We'll come out strong here in San Diego.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres took a red-eye charter from New York after Sunday's
loss, and when the team bus arrived at Qualcomm Stadium at 5:30
Monday morning, there were several hundred fans at the stadium to
greet them. Several thousand more were at Qualcomm Monday afternoon
for a Padres rally, giving them a chance to show their support or
get in one more tailgate party before the season comes to an end.
</P>
<P>
   But fan support alone won't slow down the Yankees juggernaut.
The Padres also know they have to play better, especially after
Sunday's disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know why we're here and why we got here,'' Gwynn said. ``So
far we haven't played like it. There are no excuses. They've done a
better job of doing what it takes to win than we have.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres do have the excuse that their first two starting
pitchers _ Kevin Brown and Andy Ashby _ were suffering from
flu-like symptoms in New York. But Bochy said Game 3 starter
Sterling Hitchcock is healthy, and so is the rest of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The club is doing well,'' Bochy said. ``Kevin Brown feels a
lot better, and checking out the guys, they're fine. That's not
coming into play.''
</P>
<P>
   Bochy said he'll decide today if Brown is ready to pitch Game 4
or if he'll go with Joey Hamilton instead and save his ace for Game
5. By using Brown in Game 4, Bochy could bring him back for Game 7
on three days.
</P>
<P>
   Bochy's decision depends on how quickly Brown overcomes the bug
that bit him in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin's health is a priority as far as when he's pitching,''
Bochy said. ``It's a matter of if he's strong enough to pitch. If
he doesn't, we'll go with Joey.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Padres know there likely won't be a Game 7 if they don't
win tonight. Hitchcock has been terrific in the playoffs, winning
three consecutive starts against former Cy Young Award winners
Randy Johnson, Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine. He'll face a fourth
ex-Cy Young winner in David Cone tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has survived all year long on pitching and
defense,'' Hitchcock said. ``We have to get back to the way we were
throwing all year long: get ahead and continue to throw quality
pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   They have 65,000 fans basking in the warm sunshine counting on
that. A couple of well-pitched games and the horror in the Bronx
will start to fade.

KINGS SCRAMBLE AFTER GOALIES' INJURIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Stephane Fiset is expected to be sidelined for at
least one game. Jamie Storr will miss at least a week.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the groin injuries suffered by their two goalies
10 minutes apart in the third period of Sunday's 5-5 tie with the
Colorado Avalanche, the Kings found themselves scrambling Monday as
they prepared for a five-game trip that begins Wednesday night
against the Florida Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset accompanied the Kings on their flight Monday to Fort
Lauderdale, Fla. Storr did not. He has been placed on injured
reserve, meaning he can't play for a week.
</P>
<P>
   To fill the void, the Kings (2-1-1) on Monday recalled Manny
Legace from the Long Beach Ice Dogs of the IHL and Alexey Volkov
from the Halifax Mooseheads of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey
League.
</P>
<P>
   Volkov, an 18-year-old from Russia, is expected to be the
backup. The 25-year-old Legace, who was recalled several times
earlier in his career while in the Hartford Whalers organization,
will make his NHL debut in Florida unless Fiset makes a miraculous
recovery between now and then.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, Legace was in Chicago with the Ice Dogs when their
coach, John Van Boxmeer, told him Fiset had been injured and that
he was going to be joining the Kings. But Legace didn't learn until
Monday afternoon, after flying to Florida, that both Kings goalies
had been hurt. He figured he'd been recalled to be Storr's backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably get really nervous and really emotional,''
Legace said, thinking ahead to the prospect of playing Wednesday.
``This is what I've been dreaming about since I was 4 years old,
ever since I laced up a pair of skates. But I feel kind of bad that
it's happening because guys have gotten injured.''
</P>
<P>
   Legace is 4-0 with a 1.75 goals-against average for the Ice
Dogs. Volkov, the Kings' third-round draft choice this year, is 8-0
for the Mooseheads, also with a 1.75 goals-against average.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from a taste of the NHL, both of the Kings' new goalies
will notice a little more money in their upcoming paychecks. Both
are on two-way contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Legace's salary is $80,000 when he's in the minors, a prorated
portion of $400,000 for the time he's in the NHL. Volkov makes
$47,500 in junior hockey, $425,000 in the NHL.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SAN DIEGO _ The Padres keep telling themselves things will be
better at home, because that's all they have left in a World Series
that has abruptly left them in the gutter.
</P>
<P>
   It has happened before to other visitors to the Big Apple. The
bus pulls up, and the wide-eyed tourists step off like so many
innocent lambs being led to slaughter. Their pockets are picked
clean. They are victimized by the three-card monte dealers on 42nd
Street and the vendors selling ``Rolex'' watches for $20 at Times
Square.
</P>
<P>
   So they come home and hope for a miracle or an earthquake or
anything at all that can shake loose the timely plays and the
clutch hits and the fierce confidence that had previously
victimized the Astros and Braves in the National League playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In two games, the Yankees have come at them like a rolling
bundle of butcher knives, and the Padres have spent most of their
time in a defensive posture, trying unsuccessfully to avoid getting
cut.
</P>
<P>
   They gave up nine runs in Game 1 and nine runs in Game 2, and it
seems like all that's stopping the Yankees from running it up into
double figures is their more significant goal of getting this thing
over with and hurrying along into the history books.
</P>
<P>
   The way things are going, these Yankees _ the ones with no
individual stars in the tradition of Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio, Mantle
or Jackson _ will keep cruising to another pair of victories and
make their final season mark an incredible 125-50, which will rank
with the greatest of all time in any sport.
</P>
<P>
   This is, of course, the path the Yankees have been following
since they came blazing out of the starting gate in the spring. But
it's not the one that was entirely expected against the Padres, who
had previously shown a great penchant for shoving a wrench into the
gears of favored opponents and then making everything turn in their
direction.
</P>
<P>
   In beating the Astros in the NL Division Series, the Padres
settled quickly into Houston and stole away Game 1 behind Kevin
Brown. In dismissing the Braves in the NLCS, the Padres won all
three games played in Atlanta. They had become the road warriors of
these playoffs, the worst thing to hit towns this side of funnel
clouds.
</P>
<P>
   But that all stopped suddenly upon check-in at New York, where
their ace, Brown, first suffered from a case of the flu, then was
made to feel even more miserable by getting roughed up by the
Yankees' bats and the likes of a rookie left fielder in the opener.
When somebody named Ricky Ledee is ripping you for big hits at a
.667 clip, there is nothing at all fearsome about your reputation.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Andy Ashby stepped onto the mound to pitch Game 2
for the Padres, the Yankees were lining up to tee off, while the
Padres were meekly toting their bats back to the dugout
unfulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a certain attitude, an aggressive mindset, to survive
and to thrive in New York, and the Padres never demonstrated that
in the first two games. Their leader, Tony Gwynn, spoke politely
about making a pilgrimage to Monument Park in left field at Yankee
Stadium to see the plaques of the former greats. Greg Vaughn, who
had a trade to the Yankees nullified last year because he could not
pass a physical and then went out and clobbered 50 home runs this
season, never once took a verbal shot at New York management. Even
Jim Leyritz, the grizzled cowboy who had so many key hits against
Houston and Atlanta, returned to New York _ the scene of his 1996
World Series heroics _ and rode the subway to the ballpark and
chatted with the local fans.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the Padres were a courteous bunch that was about as
interesting and ominous as the always-68-degree San Diego weather.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, of course, have helped themselves by showing great
patience at the plate, working the Padres' pitchers deep into the
count. Unlike the Astros, jumping like hungry gorillas on the first
banana, the Yankees forced Brown and Ashby into giving them strikes
to hit and then made the very most of those opportunities. Which
has quickly turned the expected into the seemingly inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   The other night outside one gate at Yankee Stadium, the vendor
collected money for programs and said, ``See you next year.'' It
doesn't look like the Series is going back to New York.
</P>
<P>
   What the former NL terrors have left is a return to Qualcomm
Stadium, which is named after a cellular-phone company. Maybe
someone will call with the answer to the Yankees. Maybe there is no
answer.
</P>
<P>
   For the Padres, as Yogi Berra once said, ``It's getting late
early.''

`CABARET': NEW CHEERLEADER FOR THE WORLD'S END
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The hunger is obvious from the very first cry of
``Hello, darlings!,'' the signature salutation she hurls at the
audience in her nightclub act. There's a new stridency in the
voice: a loud, raw, anxious quality that suggests that the speaker
would very much like you to like her, but knows that isn't going to
happen.
</P>
<P>
   Once she starts singing, sliding between defiant squawks and
forlorn mewing sounds, you expect her to lose it right there on the
stage. Sally Bowles, while never exactly the picture of mental
stability, has definitely slid closer to the edge. And her place of
employment, the Kit Kat Klub, as re-envisioned in the Roundabout
Theater Company's hit revival of ``Cabaret,'' is seeming even
bleaker than it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   With Jennifer Jason Leigh in the role, how could it be
otherwise? This deeply gifted risk-taking actress specializes in
needy neurotics in her movies, from the identity-seeking stalker of
``Single White Female'' to the talentless sister of a singing star
in ``Georgia.'' Many of the startling qualities she brought to
those brave, vanity-free portrayals are definitely evident in her
Sally Bowles, the bed-hopping chanteuse with a heart of glass.
</P>
<P>
   The effort seems all the braver when you remember that Ms. Leigh
has the unenviable task of succeeding Natasha Richardson, who won a
Tony for her brilliant portrait of this loser. But there's a
problem here. We get Sally the self-destructive strumpet loud and
clear. But Sally the siren is nowhere to be seen. Her presence is
much missed.
</P>
<P>
   This wildly popular incarnation of ``Cabaret,'' directed by Sam
Mendes and Rob Marshall, has been back on its feet on West 43rd
Street for more than a month now, after an enforced hiatus
resulting from a Times Square construction accident this summer. In
many ways, it is much the same show, a lurid, deliberately grim
presentation of Weimar decadence as a prelude to the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   But with the departure of Ms. Richardson and Alan Cumming, who
played the nightclub's creepy M.C. (and who returns after the show
moves to Studio 54 next month), the production's center has
shifted. Though Robert Sella (who has become a platinum blond for
the show, bringing to mind a Caucasian Grace Jones) is a
creditable, enthusiastic replacement for Cumming, neither he nor
Ms. Leigh walks the line between seediness and showmanship as
adroitly as their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, you may find your attention more drawn to the
nominally supporting parts, where there are some surprising
rewards, especially from Blair Brown, triumphantly cast against
type in the role of the frumpy middle-class landlady, first played
in this version by Mary Louise Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   But first, the issue of Ms. Leigh's Sally. Even a ``Cabaret'' as
grim as this one demands, as Sally herself puts it, ``a little
allure'' from its heroine. This was something Ms. Richardson
provided in spades, even as she limned the character's underlying
desperation. Ms. Leigh, whose assumed British accent is still
wobbly, exhales desperation and defeat in every utterance and every
pose. Even leading a chorus of cigar-wielding dominatrix types (and
she is, by the way, a strong and supple dancer), this Sally seems
to be anticipating a kick in the face.
</P>
<P>
   Her black helmet of hair may be designed to evoke Louise Brooks'
Lulu, the femme fatale of the great German silent movie ``Pandora's
Box,'' but she is much less vamp than victim. The interpretation
has arresting moments, as when she blows a forlorn kiss to the
audience after singing ``Mein Herr.'' But Sally has to embody the
ambiguous temptations of the Berlin with which Clifford (John
Benjamin Hickey), her American boyfriend, falls in love. A
glamour-free Sally has a dangerously low seduction quotient.
</P>
<P>
   Hickey, on the other hand, has grown into a new assurance since
the revival opened last spring. Perhaps Ms. Leigh's breakable Sally
has inspired him to become stronger as a counterbalance. His
Clifford remains the goony, naive American, but there are more
shadings to both his moral and sexual ambivalence. Similarly,
Michele Pawk and Denis O'Hare, as a Nazi-sympathizing prostitute
and businessman, have refined and deepened performances that were
excellent to begin with. Their aggressive singing of ``Tomorrow
Belongs to Me,'' the Aryan anthem, has become the show's
shiver-making high point.
</P>
<P>
   The revelation, however, is Ms. Brown, best known as the winsome
Molly Dodd on television and too often described in the 1980s as
``the thinking man's sex symbol.'' As Fraulein Schneider, a rueful
survivor of war and revolution, Ms. Brown is tougher and earthier
than her predecessor. Ms. Wilson gave off a deflated air, like
someone who had been hit by a steamroller and never risen to her
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown's Fraulein is definitely still standing. There's
steel, as well as regret and nostalgia, in her robust singing
voice. And there's a new sensuality and pathos in her relationship
with Herr Schultz, the Jewish fruiterer played by Ron Rifkin.
Rifkin was always affecting in this role; there is now a richness
in the part that approaches the tragic.
</P>
<P>
   They have become the characters whose fate you most wonder and
worry about when the evening ends. Ms. Leigh's Sally, it is clear
from her first entrance, is as surely headed for destruction as
those bound for the concentration camps.

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
SAN DIEGO _ ``Spank the Yanks'' is the phrase of choice here in
Mission Valley, where the San Diego Padres were glad to return
after some hostile treatment over the weekend at Yankee Stadium.
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the surface, their mission seems darned-near impossible. So
far, they've been on the wrong end of the corporal punishment, and
the New York Yankees are just two lashings shy of leaving a
permanent bruise.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time during their improbable jaunt through the
playoffs, the Padres have found themselves in a hole almost as big
as the valley they call home.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven World Series,
and they'll send 20-game winner David Cone to the mound tonight to
try to move one step closer to their second Series championship in
three years.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres are hoping their fortunes will change before a
sold-out crowd at Qualcomm Stadium, but they know it will take more
than home cooking to nourish them back into title contention.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees outscored the Padres 18-9 in the first two games of
the Series and have pretty much had their way with the National
League champions. What is it going to take for the Padres to
finally win a game? Don't ask Tony Gwynn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't done it yet,'' Gwynn said. ``So I really don't know
what we're going to have to do to beat them. I have to admit, from
what I've seen of the Yankees, they're pretty impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   While that may sound like a concession speech, the Padres are
hardly ready to throw in the towel. They appeared loose at Monday's
late-afternoon workout, during which several players had their
children on the field. If anything, the Padres appeared more
willing to get back on the field rather than spend the day off
answering questions about being down 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our morale is fine,'' said Gwynn, the only remaining Padre
from the 1984 World Series team. ``We're still confident that we
can win this thing, but we know we can't win it playing the way we
did in the first two games. I think we're just tired of talking
about it. I haven't been (to the World Series) in a while, so I
forgot how much you had to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 44 teams that have taken a 2-0 lead in the World Series,
33 have completed the job, including six in a row until the Yankees
overcame a 2-0 deficit to beat Atlanta in the 1996 World Series.
Twenty-two of the 29 teams that have won the first two games at
home have won the championship.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the Padres' odds will be worse if they don't win
tonight behind lefthander Sterling Hitchcock, who is 3-0 in the
postseason with victories over Randy Johnson, Greg Maddux and Tom
Glavine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone asked me if we have to win (tonight's) game,'' Padres
third baseman Ken Caminiti said. ``I don't think we have to, but it
would be nice. I wouldn't say never with this team. I believe we
will win. I believe we can come back from anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some work cut out for us, but we'll have a change of
atmosphere (at Qualcomm Stadium). I thought some guys were finding
it hard to relax (in New York). I saw some guys taking deep
breaths. We're down a little. Everyone is a little ticked off. But
I think we'll be fine. I don't think being down two games to none
scares us. We're veterans. This team will loosen up (at home).''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres were 54-27 at Qualcomm Stadium this season, and they
were 10-1 when the crowd exceeded 50,000. They have won three of
their five games at home this postseason, and if they ever needed a
home-field advantage, now is the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The home crowd could be huge for us,'' Gwynn said. ``But
that's only if we do the things we need to do to win. If we don't,
it will be quiet just like it was when (Andres) Galarraga hit that
grand slam (in the NL Championship Series).
</P>
<P>
   ``We can talk about the home-field advantage all we want, but it
won't mean anything if we don't play better. That's the bottom
line; we have to play better, and it needs to start (tonight).''

PADRES DOWN BUT NOT OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ On the flight home, the San Diego Padres, down 2-0
in the series of their lives, were so quiet you could hear a peanut
drop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were done, toast,'' Tony Gwynn said. ``Guys all had their
travel brochures out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Friars were fried.
</P>
<P>
   So how about some good news for Padres fans?
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn wasn't talking about (begin ital)these(end ital) Padres,
by all accounts a chipper group as they winged their way home from
New York early Monday morning after being bombed by the Yankees in
the first two games of the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   He was talking about the 1984 Padres, who made their silent
flight home from Chicago after being outscored by the Cubs 17-2 in
the first two games of the National League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a Padres fan, you know what happened next. As their
bus from the airport pulled up to the San Diego stadium late on
that Wednesday night 14 Octobers ago, their closed mouths dropped
open at the sight of hundreds of cheering fans in the parking lot,
an enormous welcoming committee. Gwynn remembers the crowd
numbering 5,000. Bruce Bochy, a Padres benchwarmer then and their
manager now, says it was more like 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever, both say it revived the Padres, who took three
straight games from the Cubs in front of consecutive club-record
crowds, clinching the best-of-five series with the help of Gwynn's
bad-hop double and Leon Durham's fielding error.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans played a big role in helping us come back,'' Bochy
said Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The point is that at least three Padres _ Gwynn, Bochy and
third-base coach Tim Flannery, another holdover from '84 _ have an
idea what it takes to overcome 0-2. Who could blame the rest if
they pulled out the cruise pamphlets?
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have been awesome, the Padres have been miserable
beyond the need for second-guessing, and even the Padres' stabs at
the obligatory ``something positive'' sound far-fetched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take away the seventh inning of Game 1, and you've got a
pretty good series going,'' Gwynn said, referring to the Yankees'
(begin ital)seven-run(end ital) inning.
</P>
<P>
   What you've got is the Yankees scoring nine a game against the
Padres' 18- and 17-game winners, and nine-game winner Sterling
Hitchcock being counted on to stop the mayhem in Game 3 tonight at
Qualcomm Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   You've got a flu bug, or something, going through the Padres'
pitching staff, and possibility a shin bruise will keep Kevin Brown
from making his Game 4 start Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   And lest anybody think the San Diego pitchers are the whole
problem here, there's also the matter of the Nos.3 through 6
hitters in their lineup going 1 for 12 with runners on base.
</P>
<P>
   Fans? Anybody? A little help!
</P>
<P>
   The Padres flew all night after Sunday's game and pulled into
the parking lot about 6 a.m. There were not 5,000 fans at that
hour. There were a few hundred, according to local television
reports.
</P>
<P>
   This is, generally, a city deflated after underdog wins over
Houston and Atlanta in the National League playoffs made it think
anything was possible.
</P>
<P>
   Soaking up local color at the bars and restaurants (and more
bars) of the Gaslamp Quarter Sunday evening, as Game 2 went from
3-0 to 6-0 to 7-0 in the early innings, one encountered a San Diego
sports publicist trudging up Fifth Street with a ``Yes on C''
placard under his arm.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition C would approve the use of public money to build the
Padres a new park. The PR guy was shepherding around a video crew,
looking for outbreaks of baseball fever, fodder for a campaign
commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not looking too good,'' he said outside a sports bar
where the game was being watched on a dozen TV screens by
long-faced Padres faithful.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the sun came up in a cloudless sky the next morning, and
all the ``Go Padres!'' signs remained in place in store windows and
on hotel marquees. A Padres T-shirt was still the uniform of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   San Diegans, once roused from their Garden of Eden slumber by a
winning team, tend to discover they like the feeling and don't want
to lose it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They rise to the occasion,'' Bochy said Monday, standing
behind the batting cage during an offday workout.
</P>
<P>
   What he was really saying was, the Padres need them to rise
again. Qualcomm is sold out the next three nights, and what the
fans lack in Yankee Stadium profanity, they'd better make up for in
sheer deafening noise.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the way the Yankees are going, picking up the Padres
might be too much to ask of only 65,000 people. &QL;

KROGER-MEYER DEAL USHERS IN NEW AGE OF SUPERMARKETS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Supermarkets will become bigger and flashier in
the wake of a string of mega-mergers within the industry,
culminating in Kroger Co.'s agreement to buy Fred Meyer Inc. for
$11.8billion in a deal announced Monday after weeks of speculation.
</P>
<P>
   The deal makes Cincinnati-based Kroger the nation's leading
supermarket operator, with markets from Southern California
(Ralphs, Hughes and Food 4 Less) to the Eastern Seaboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country has a strong supermarket culture and it's not
going away,'' asserted retail consultant Jack Trout of Stamford,
Conn. ``They've boutiquized themselves and set up stores within
stores to protect themselves when people change eating habits such
as more takeout foods and natural foods. When challenged by
specialists, they've changed.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of change will continue, industry observers believe.
To compete effectively against aggressive giant discounters like
Wal-Mart, Target and Kmart, Kroger will have to:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; !bbox! &LR; Offer premium services like florists, bakeries,
delicatessens and ethnic food sections.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; !bbox! &LR; Provide enough check stands and clerks so that customers
don't become impatient.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; !bbox! &LR; Keep prices low enough to compete with Wal-Mart and
provide deep discounts on staples like videotapes, tortilla chips,
detergents and soda.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; !bbox! &LR; Adjust each store to the needs of the local market.
</P>
<P>
   Stakes are high for Cincinnati-based Kroger, which will have
2,200 stores in 31 states. The deal comes 10 weeks after
Albertson's agreed to buy American Stores, parent of Lucky and
Sav-On, for $11.7billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grocery stores are a local phenomenon, so shoppers don't care
about stores that are 100 miles away, just the ones in their back
yard,'' said consultant Frederick Marx of Farmington Hills, Mich.
``They have to be clean, offer fresh food and convenience is
critical. Chances are you tend to go to more than one until they
disappoint you and then it's all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe Kroger is up to the challenge. Retail
consultant Mark Kissel noted Kroger was savvy enough to begin
switching to larger formats a decade ago before the trend caught
on. ``They're very good at the fundamentals,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Trout said dealing successfully with expansion is particularly
tricky. ``It's not a question of getting big; it's a question of
managing yourself when you are big,'' he added. ``It takes some
real logistical skills to manage something that large. You've got
to get people in and out of stores quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Kroger's changes will be gradual but critical, since the new
company will have annual sales of $43billion. Private labels brands
will change at Ralphs and Hughes but that's all the changes
customers will see immediately when Kroger completes its purchase
of Fred Meyer early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt that people going into a Ralphs will see much change
initially,'' said analyst Sally Wallick of Legg Mason. ``Both sides
have already emphasized that they want to be very careful not to
disrupt the customer, so my guess is that the customer is not
really going to notice any difference right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallick said Wal-Mart, which has pledged to become the nation's
largest food retailer, is the biggest threat to Kroger because of
its ability to underprice rivals. ``Although Wal-Mart isn't a big
deal out West, it's going to be a different story in 10 years,''
she said. ``If I were a supermarket operator, that's what I'd lose
sleep over.''
</P>
<P>
   Trout agreed. ``They're all terrified of Wal-Mart,'' he said.
``They all sense that they have to get big so that they can beat up
on the manufacturers and get deals. That's what is driving them,
just like the banks.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts give Kroger, a powerhouse in the Midwest, a good shot
at beating back Wal-Mart and other rivals. ``They're an excellent
company with great strategies,'' Marx said. ``If they have a site
in an upscale area, it offers sushi and restaurant-quality foods.
Their floral areas are outstanding and the bakeries hold their
own.''
</P>
<P>
   Kroger also relies on straightforward marketing strategies,
including an oft-repeated jingle about ``going Krogering.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every kid in the Midwest can tell you what Krogering means,''
Marx noted. ``Wal-Mart can kick up some dust but Kroger has nailed
down the A-plus locations at the corner of Busy and Busy.''
</P>
<P>
   Kissel said operators like Kroger still have plenty of
opportunity to take advantage of shoppers' changing tastes. ``It is
the shrewd competitor who can take what rivals are doing and
somehow present it as their own,'' he said. &UR; !dlim! &LR;  &QL;

TEXAS DISTRICT MAY BE MODEL FOR TURNAROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY SHERRY JOE CROSBY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles educators learned Monday how a poor
Texas school district transformed itself into one of the best in
the Lone Star State by stressing test scores, involving parents and
holding employees accountable for student achievement _ even firing
a whole school staff.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the Ysleta Independent School District in El
Paso described their successful reform efforts to more than 200
parents, teachers and administrators during a daylong conference
sponsored by the Los Angeles Annenberg Metropolitan Project and the
Annenberg Institute for School Reform.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas delegation is in town just as LAUSD Superintendent
Ruben Zacarias is receiving a series of reports on accountability
from a task force of parents, educators and business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's a very powerful model for our folks to
explore,'' said Maria Casillas, president of LAAMP. ``We're
beginning to explore how to build public understanding of school
reform ... and move forward to school accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   Located near the U.S.-Mexico border, Ysleta was considered one
of the worst school districts in the state five years ago. Last
year, up to 90percent of its students passed the Texas Assessment
of Academic Skills _ a standardized exam of reading, writing and
math _ at higher rates than any other large-city district in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the lowest-scoring urban school district,'' said
Ysleta Superintendent Anthony Trujillo. ``Last year, we were the
first `recognized' urban school district in the state,'' &UR;  &LR; a special
commendation conferred by Texas education officials.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the accountability system, Trujillo fired the entire
staff of a high school, removed all but 19 of 58 principals
districtwide and forced out 2,000 teachers of 3,000 in the system.
He also gave schools control over their budgets and curriculum,
gave principals the authority to hire and fire teachers and urged
parents to participate in campus decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can do it with 50,000 students (in Ysleta), you can do
it with 600,000 (in the LAUSD),'' Trujillo told the Los Angeles
audience. ``The key is the 1.2million parents out in your
community.''
</P>
<P>
   In August, Los Angeles Unified School District board members,
administrators and parents visited Texas to study the state's
accountability system and see how districts such as Ysleta
implemented reforms.
</P>
<P>
   LAUSD parent activists said they were impressed by what they saw
in Ysleta, and want to replicate many of its reforms but fear they
face a contentious political battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can do it but we need a school board that will back
the superintendent and the school district,'' said Kathleen Dixon,
chairwoman of the LAUSD's parent collaborative and a member of the
superintendent's accountability task force. ``We need a school
board that is willing to make hard political decisions.''

WILLIAMS HAS BAT IN TUNE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ You could say Bernie Williams was classically
trained to be a featured attraction in the Bronx Zoo. As a
teen-ager he studied the guitar with the idea of becoming a
professional musician.
</P>
<P>
   The instrument he wields now is a very different kind of wood,
but the setting really hasn't changed all that much. As in his
recital days, he practices for months for that one shot, as he put
it, ``to get it right'' when everyone is looking.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday in the visiting clubhouse of Qualcomm Stadium, the
Yankees center fielder spoke of sitting alone in front of the whole
school in his native Puerto Rico, playing a piece of music he had
been memorizing for months and being graded on the performance. He
was 15 or 16 when he had an experience on that stage that would
help steel him for the day, years later, when he'd be standing in
the batter's box on baseball's grandest stage staring at an 0-2
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was playing a Brazilian piece. A beautiful piece, too,''
said Williams wistfully. ``I got about halfway through it and I
blanked out. So I started again and on the exact same chord, I
blanked out again. I went running off the stage crying.''
</P>
<P>
   For a moment Williams let the memory carry him off like a
long-forgotten melody. Then he shook his head and chuckled. What
seemed so traumatic then sounds trivial now.
</P>
<P>
   No one at his school, after all, carried batteries and change in
their pockets to throw at the first sound of a discordant note. No
one from his school newspaper reported that he would be moving on
to another school next year. No one at his school made him feel
uncomfortable in his own skin.
</P>
<P>
   Williams wishes he could say he has enjoyed the Yankees'
remarkable run this season. Instead, he settles for the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a grind,'' said the man who won his first batting
title and second Gold Glove in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is no small reason why the Yankees have won 123 games
and are on the edge of something ethereal. If they can put away a
San Diego team that they have outscored 18-9 in the first two games
of this World Series, Williams, 30, will go down as the all-around
best player on arguably the all-time greatest team.
</P>
<P>
   He's a huge part of the Yankees' present, but he doesn't know
how he figures in their future. Williams will be a free agent the
day after the curtain falls on the season and he isn't convinced
the Yankees will pay whatever it costs to keep him.
</P>
<P>
   Some media reports already have his bags packed and tagged for
Arizona. In the American League Championship Series, the
speculation about his future reached a crescendo and Williams
started to feel trapped, like air in a singer's larynx.
</P>
<P>
   He had to escape, lest he let slip away the focus that enabled
him to play a sonata on stage or hit the sweet spot of the bat
precisely as he had practiced it over and over and over.
</P>
<P>
   So the Yankees' best-of-seven series against Cleveland found
Williams taking a commercial flight instead of the team charter and
evading reporters and champagne corks, ``simplifying things'' in
his words.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' uncharacteristic aloofness raised eyebrows among
outsiders, but inside the clubhouse, right fielder Paul O'Neill
said, everything was harmonious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier for him that way,'' O'Neill said. ``We understand
that you only have so much room in your head and sometimes all the
media and all the distractions take you away from your game.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' focus found its way back to Yankee Stadium Sunday,
making a grand entrance in Game 2 of the best-of-seven series that
continues tonight. In his second at-bat against Padres starter Andy
Ashby, Williams saw two quick strikes. He didn't panic, as someone
who had gone hitless in the previous game might have been wont to
do. Instead, he got really, really patient.
</P>
<P>
   He looked at two balls, fouled off the fifth pitch, looked at
another ball _ that made the count, 3-2 _ fouled off another pitch
and then sent Ashby's eighth offering into the bleachers for a
two-run home run that extended the Yankees' lead to 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to a musician to hold out for the perfect pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Williams called it ``one of the best at-bats I've had all year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the things I strive for as a hitter, to have the
odds so against you and then work your way through it and get the
best possible result,'' he said. ``Most of my home runs this year
have been on the first couple of pitches. I've gotten a hold of a
mistake and hit it out. The fact that I had to struggle so bad and
work so hard for that pitch made (the homer) remarkable in
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   That it broke wide open a World Series game made an impression
on a lot of other people.
</P>
<P>
   Davey Johnson, one of the finalists for the Dodgers' managerial
position, was so moved by what he witnessed, he urged George
Steinbrenner to re-sign Williams, whom he referred to as ``the
heart and soul'' of the ballclub.
</P>
<P>
   It's that kind of chorus that has the Yankees' Melody Man
reaching for his guitar a lot these days. If you're Williams,
nothing cuts through the tension like a few chords. &QL;

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
SAN DIEGO _ They're a blue-clad, mask-wearing fraternity that every
manager, player and devout baseball fan loves to hate.
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a time when umpires considered themselves a success if
no one noticed them or talked about them. Nowadays, umps are
constantly analyzed, scrutinized and second-guessed.
</P>
<P>
   Some are well-respected, others reviled. They are bumped and
occasionally spit at, and, oh, are they stirring up some dust.
</P>
<P>
   After one of the most memorable baseball seasons ever, the
postseason has turned into open season on the umps. Names such as
McGwire, Sosa and Ripken find themselves replaced by Hendry,
Brinkman and McKean.
</P>
<P>
   Who?
</P>
<P>
   Ask Toronto Blue Jays righthander Roger Clemens, a four-time Cy
Young Award winner, and he can tell you just about anything you
want to know about the threesome and many of the other 61 full-time
umps in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens regularly compiles files on how each umpire interprets
the strike zone. Scouting umpires, as well as scouting opponents,
is a major part of a pitcher's strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing that is important for me to know about umpires
is where they call balls and strikes,'' Clemens said last week. ``I
try to keep track of which umpires call an east-west strike zone
and which call north-south.''
</P>
<P>
   Therein, some baseball insiders say, lies the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Umpires long ago stopped using the strike zone as specified in
the rule book, ignoring the area above the waist. Many are going to
a broader interpretation, sometimes calling strikes on pitches that
are several inches from either side of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Some umpires call low strikes; some call high strikes. Still
others call wide inside or outside pitches for strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Get the picture?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating,'' New York Yankees outfielder Paul O'Neill
said. ``I don't know if they're intentionally doing it to speed
games up. But if the strike zone is here (gesturing with his
hands), they're going to throw it there. If it's here, they're
going to throw it there. As wide as they go, the pitchers are going
to continually throw wider and wider.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt the plate umpire's definition of the strike
zone has become a hot topic during this year's playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 2 of the American League Division Series between
Cleveland and Boston, Joe Brinkman's ball-and-strike calls provoked
a dispute that led to his ejecting Indians manager Mike Hargrove _
three pitches into the game. Cleveland starting pitcher Dwight
Gooden was tossed after he had faced only four batters and thrown
22 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday's World Series opener, home-plate umpire Richie
Garcia was criticized for his call on a 2-and-2 pitch from San
Diego reliever Mark Langston to Tino Martinez with two out in the
seventh inning. Garcia called the pitch, which appeared to be
straight down the middle, a ball, and Martinez smacked a
game-deciding grand slam on the next pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Garcia was working Game 1 of the ALCS when a
young boy reached over the Yankee Stadium fence and caught Derek
Jeter's fly ball just as Baltimore's Tony Tarasco prepared to catch
it. Garcia ruled no interference, and the non-call helped the
Yankees set the tone for the series.
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove said most players don't mind a different strike zone,
but it becomes a problem when few umpires stick to it. Some umpires
subscribe to the ``call 'em as you see 'em'' theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our job to adjust to that strike zone,'' Hargrove said.
``Nobody has a problem with that. What's a problem is one time this
is a ball, and the next time it's a strike.''
</P>
<P>
   National League umpire Eric Gregg came under fire during Game 5
of the NLCS in 1997 with his broad strike zone, routinely giving
Florida Marlins rookie Livan Hernandez the outside part of the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez struck out 15 Atlanta Braves in the game, ending the
game by ringing up Fred McGriff on a called third strike _ a curve
that never ventured closer than a foot to what the rule book
defines as the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know me,'' Gregg said in a postgame interview, ``you
know my strike zone.''
</P>
<P>
   NL director of umpires Paul Runge, however, said the strike zone
does not fall under the category of a judgment call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody interprets (the strike zone) the same, but I
don't think everybody handles it the same,'' Runge said. ``But I
don't think any umpire should have his strike zone. There is no
umpire with his strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he makes that statement, I think it's a mis-statement. I
don't think he really means that. The strike zone is the strike
zone. When he reads the book, he reads it the same as anybody else.
If he adjusts his strike zone to something different than what it
should be, he'll have to deal with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Controversy among umpires hasn't been contained to balls and
strikes. Ted Hendry, who worked the AL Championship Series,
triggered a national debate for not calling interference against
Cleveland's Travis Fryman in Game 2. Fryman, who bunted down the
first-base line, was hit by a throw from Yankees first baseman Tino
Martinez to second baseman Chuck Knoblauch, who was covering first.
The Indians went on to score the go-ahead run as Knoblauch
protested while the ball was still in play, lying untouched on the
infield.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 6, Hendry called Bernie Williams safe at second, ruling
that Cleveland shortstop Omar Vizquel's foot came off the base
before he caught the ball _ a ruling even some of the Yankees
thought was the wrong call.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 4, Jeter was attempting to steal second in the fifth
inning when an on-target throw from Sandy Alomar Jr. hit Jim
McKean, who tried to jump out of the way but kicked the ball into
right field.
</P>
<P>
   Hendry was also hit by a line drive by Vizquel in Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   How can such mistakes happen at such a pivotal point of the
season?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything you do in your career is magnified (in the
postseason). Your name is synonymous with the play,'' AL director
of umpires Marty Springstead said. ``People don't forget. They seem
to remember one play.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's so unfair. There are hundreds of plays, and probably 99
percent are all right. We're not superhumans, and we don't pretend
to be. We're trying to do our job.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the system that took effect in 1995, all umpires are
eligible for postseason play and the All-Star Game. However, an
umpire cannot work more than one ``special event'' _ All-Star Game,
League Championship Series or World Series _ in a year, although he
can work a Division Series and the World Series. No umpire can work
successive World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Under an earlier collective-bargaining agreement, umpires were
chosen strictly on a rotating basis. The leagues have long awaited
a merit system to determine who works the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   The three AL umpires _ crew chief Garcia, Dale Scott and Tim
Tschida _ who are on the six-man World Series crew worked during
the first round of the playoffs. Jerry Crawford, Dana DeMuth and
Mark Hirschbeck represent the NL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only speak for the NL, but these guys are right at the
top,'' Runge said of Crawford, DeMuth and Hirschbeck, who have a
combined 46 years' experience in the NL. ``They are the best-rated
guys from this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Ratings become irrelevant, however, when television puts every
call and play under a microscope. During one game in the ALCS, NBC
showed diagrams and charts of the strike zone after several
disputed calls.
</P>
<P>
   Even with certain camera angles, though, there isn't an accurate
gauge of determining who's right and who's wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of eyes on you. There are all kinds of ways
for television to pinpoint every single thing,'' said ESPN analyst
Kevin Kennedy, a leading candidate to become the next manager of
the Los Angeles Dodgers. ``You have to realize everybody is human,
everybody different. Everybody sees things a different way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though there is a strike zone by definition, the umpires
aren't computers back there. That's what makes the human element of
the sport so great, because there are going to be replays that say,
`Oh, maybe that was a ball; maybe that guy was out.' Over the
course of the long haul, for the most part things work out pretty
even.''
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't stopped the media from scrutinizing the umpires.
Throughout the World Series, the Los Angeles Times is running a
guest column by Doug Harvey, who umpired in the NL for 31 years.
</P>
<P>
   What did he think of Garcia's calls in Game 1?
</P>
<P>
   ``Through the entire ballgame, I saw two pitches that I might
have possibly disagreed with _ one in the fourth inning that was
called a strike and the 2-2 pitch to Tino Martinez in the
seventh,'' wrote Harvey, who worked more than 4,000 consecutive
games from 1962 to 1988. ``Of course, that's the pitch that
everybody was griping about.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you went out there and you measured it with the finest
instruments in the world, you'd find out that pitch was in that
gray zone between a ball and a strike. It's in that zone, because
the difference in an umpire's eye between ball and strike is a fine
pencil-lead mark. And that son of a gun, that's where it was _ it's
in one of those gray zones.
</P>
<P>
   ``And for some reason _ it's the bane of the Irish, it's the
luck of the umpire _ you always seem to get a pitch like that with
bases stacked. I guarantee you, the next one's at least going off
the wall someplace. It always seems to happen. That same pitch, if
it's a tied ballgame and nobody's on base, everybody says, `Aw,
c'mon, get the ball up. Oh, hey, it's a little low.' And they move
on. But because of the situation, it suddenly becomes a big, big
pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Springstead: ``Any mistake (in the playoffs) is magnified
a hundred-fold. I think the postseason has always been
pressure-packed. It used to be everybody watched the World Series.
Now, they watch the Division Series and there are more
opportunities to visualize umpires making mistakes.''

NHL'S NEW RULES NEED WORK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By ROGER PHILLIPS &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; Long Beach Press-Telegram &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   When Wayne Gretzky's New York Rangers scored three goals on
Saturday night, it was a veritable offensive explosion for the
Broadway Blueshirts, which should tell you something about how
effective the NHL's new offense-friendly rules were in the first 10
days of the new season.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller, narrower crease, the extra two feet behind the net,
the size restrictions on goalies' equipment all were supposed to
lead to more scoring, which would lead to more fans, which would
lead to higher television ratings, which would lead to more
revenue, which would lead to hockey becoming the hot sport of the
new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Forget it.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some numbers: In 1981-82, the year Gretzky scored a
record 92 goals for Edmonton, teams combined to average eight goals
a game. Last season, the average was 5.28. Through Sunday this
season, with 52 games in the books played under the new rules, the
average was 4.75.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest impediment to more scoring is those darned coaches.
They like to keep their jobs, which requires winning, and in an era
of 27 teams and not enough offensive talent to go around, the
surest road to success is keeping the puck out of your own net. The
defenses have gotten so stingy, in fact, that even a team such as
Colorado _ one of a diminishing number of clubs with excellent
offensive depth _ struggles at times to score. The Avalanche was
shut out twice in its first three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 2-1 games because defense wins in hockey,'' said
Boston coach Pat Burns, whose team already has recorded three
shutouts this season. ``If you cut down on your goals-against
average, you have a chance. If you don't, you're not going to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Kings coach Larry Robinson agrees more credit needs to go to
those who are responsible for the low scores.
</P>
<P>
   Said Robinson, ``Do they ever think that maybe teams are
concentrating more on playing well at both ends of the rink and
goaltenders are doing a good job of keeping the puck out of the
net?''
</P>
<P>
   One man's proposal: Kings center Ray Ferraro says he thinks if
the NHL really wants to perk up offense, it should experiment
seriously with eliminating the center red line for two-line passes.
It would still be used for icing.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating the two-line pass would allow for more wide-open
play. A defenseman could feed the puck ahead to a forward hanging
on the far side of the neutral zone, which presumably would lead to
more breakaways and outnumbered rushes.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro said he's not surprised this season's rules changes have
had such a minimal effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two feet behind the net is not going to open up the game,''
Ferraro said. ``That's not the magical answer. The only thing I've
seen to open up games is to take away the red line. But if they
want to do that, they have to try it in every exhibition game.''
</P>
<P>
   During this preseason, there were 109 games, with teams
combining for an average of six goals a game. In 12 of those games,
the red line was eliminated, with teams averaging 6.17 goals. In
the 97 games played with a red line, teams averaged 5.89.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers are hardly compelling, and there is one major
reason why eliminating the red line might not be the solution: With
teams already so focused on defense, they probably would play even
more conservatively than they do now in order to avoid those
breakaways and outnumbered attacks. Still, eliminating the red line
might be worth more of a look than it so far has been given.
</P>
<P>
   Another embarrassment: The NHL just can't seem to get through a
season without at least one major embarrassment involving a
franchise owner.
</P>
<P>
   If it isn't former Kings owner Bruce McNall ending up in prison
for fraud or former New York Islanders owner John Spano ending up
in prison for his own McNallian activities or the new Islanders
owners trying and failing to escape their county-owned arena by
claiming that it's falling down, then it's the Pittsburgh Penguins
sliding into bankruptcy six years after winning two consecutive
Stanley Cups.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Pittsburgh has spent nearly $13 million in public
funds to prop up the franchise, yet new co-owner Roger Marino came
onto the scene, knowingly took on millions of dollars in debt to
former Penguins players (including about $30 million to the retired
Mario Lemieux), tried to avoid some of those commitments, then
rewarded the Steel City's taxpayers for propping up the team by
investigating relocation of the franchise to Kansas City or
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Someday, commissioner Gary Bettman may get the NHL's house
completely tidy. But that day doesn't appear likely anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Snowed under: While the Penguins are flailing about off the ice,
the Avalanche is struggling on it. Just a little more than two
years ago the Avalanche captured the Stanley Cup, led by young
stars Joe Sakic and Peter Forsberg and a deep, talented squad. The
future appeared bright.
</P>
<P>
   But the Avalanche has not been back to the finals since winning
the Cup, and last season Colorado was bounced from the playoffs in
the first round. This season, following a 5-5 tie Sunday with the
Kings, Colorado is off to a disappointing 0-4-1 start.
</P>
<P>
   What's happened? Up front, Colorado is still to be envied, led
by franchise centers Sakic and Forsberg. But the Avalanche is thin
on defense, and the absence of unsigned power-play quarterback
Sandis Ozolinsh has Colorado off to a 2-for-27 start with the man
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   On top of all this, goalie Patrick Roy will be an unrestricted
free agent at season's end and looked extremely ordinary in
Sunday's tie with the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the heck is wrong with me,'' said Roy, 33.
``I wish I knew. I've got to play with more intensity, there's no
doubt about it. I'm soft right now and I have to start playing
hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche has too much talent to remain in its early-season
rut. On the other hand, they have a long way to go to reclaim the
stature they enjoyed such a short time ago. &QL;

WIN BORING, BUT BEAUTIFUL  
 KHABIBULIN FACES ONLY 14 SHOTS IN STUFFING BRUINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a guy who only gave up one goal and just saw his team win
for the second straight time, Coyotes goalie Nikolai Khabibulin
didn't look too upbeat in the team's dressing room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice game,'' someone said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' Khabibulin answered. ``It wasn't so good at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Coyotes just stuffed the Boston Bruins, 3-1?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, and it was the most boring game I've played in the
National Hockey League,'' Khabibulin said. ``It wasn't any fun.''
</P>
<P>
   OK. So Khabibulin only had to face 14 shots. Ask the 25-year-old
Russian, and he'd tell you he'd rather face 40 every night. But ask
his teammates, and they'll say Khabibulin should shut his trap and
be khabby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have to kill him for saying something like
that,'' said captain Keith Tkachuk, who scored his first goal of
the season and whose line dominated the Bruins throughout most of
the game. ``We don't want to see him face 40-50 shots. We know he's
a good goalie. But we know we're doing our job when he only faces
14 of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes (2-1-0), coming off an equally impressive 5-2 rout
of Colorado on Thursday, now have scored eight goals in their past
two games and have gotten nine goals overall from nine different
players.
</P>
<P>
   Center Cliff Ronning and right wing Dallas Drake also scored
goals, and the Coyotes also got two assists from Jeremy Roenick.
Tkachuk's line, which includes Drake and Roenick, accounted for
five of a possible nine points on the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked real well together, I think,'' Roenick said. ``Our
line is very powerful, offensively, and we do the job, defensively.
A lot of you media people were talking about how we shouldn't be
playing together, but tonight was a perfect example of how we can
mesh and jell as long as we keep it simple.''
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, the Coyotes controlled the tempo and took it
right to the Bruins, who were playing for the third time in four
nights and are in the middle of a seven-game trip, their longest of
the season. It showed.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for good things to happen, either. On
Tkachuk's second shift, he and Roenick took turns throwing a series
of big body checks on veteran defenseman Ray Bourque in the Phoenix
zone. The old man must have been drilled three or four times along
the boards.
</P>
<P>
   It created space for Roenick and Tkachuk to operate, and after
Drake gave Bourque a check of his own for good measure, he fed
Roenick, who in turn, fed Tkachuk right in front for an easy
one-timer.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes captain finally was cheered instead of jeered by the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always knew the fans in this town were behind me,'' he said,
referring to the criticism he took for his prolonged contract
holdout this summer.
</P>
<P>
   So much for another Boston shutout. Goalie Byron Dafoe, Monday's
starter, had two of them coming in. Backup Robbie Tallas had one
the night before in San Jose. The three shutouts in five games were
the most ever for a Bruins' team in the franchise's storied,
75-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Ronning made the score, 2-0, at the start of the second period,
wristing a shot high over Dafoe's right shoulder toward the end of
a five-minute man-advantage situation. Boston left wing Rob DiMaio
gave it to the Coyotes, drawing a major elbowing penalty _ and a
game misconduct _ for going at Drake's head at the 16:58 mark of
the opening period.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Ferraro got a loose puck alone in front of Khabibulin and
made the score, 2-1, on what was just Boston's third shot of the
game 24 minutes and 31 seconds after the first drop of the puck.
The Coyotes got their two-goal cushion back, though, when Drake
sent a hard slap shot past Dafoe midway through the second on a
setup pass from Roenick for a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Khabibulin and the penalty-killing unit finished the job. &QL;

NEARLY 100 ARRESTED IN PROTEST OF DEATH OF A GAY STUDENT IN
WYOMING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What began as a rally down Fifth Avenue to mourn and
protest the killing of a gay college student in Wyoming ended
chaotically on Monday night, with nearly 100 arrests and several
injuries after demonstrators faced off against police officers in
riot gear and on horseback.
</P>
<P>
   Several demonstrators and police officers were slightly injured
during the loosely organized rally, whose planners did not have a
permit to march in the street. One woman was hurt by a police horse
when mounted officers were sent into the crowd to disperse the
marchers.
</P>
<P>
   More than 4,000 people attended the march, which was billed as a
``political funeral'' to protest the killing of Matthew Shepard,
21, who died on Oct. 12 after being beaten and lashed to a fence in
Wyoming in what the authorities called a bias-related crime.
Carrying a pine coffin and memorial candles, the marchers had
planned to march down Fifth Avenue from 59th Street to Madison
Square Park at 23d Street.
</P>
<P>
   Scuffling between the marchers and the police broke out at
several points along the route when officers in riot gear tried to
keep the demonstrators on the sidewalk. Several organizers and
marchers accused the police of over-reacting, and said there would
have been no problems had they been allowed to continued along
their planned route.
</P>
<P>
   But police officials defended their response, saying the
demonstrators created a safety hazard by spilling into the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Finklestein, a march organizer, said that she was injured
by a police horse when mounted officers rode into the crowd on West
43d Street in an effort to disperse the marchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking part in a demonstration against the gay-bashing in
Wyoming and here in New York City, which is supposed to be the
center of gay life in New York,'' she said, nursing her swollen,
bruised right ankle while waiting for an ambulance. ``We were doing
nothing illegal, wrong or unsafe, and I was trampled by a horse
ridden by a New York City police officer.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night police officials said that they had made at
least 96 arrests, mostly for disorderly conduct. One police
lieutenant injured his finger in the fracas and was sent to a local
hospital for X-rays, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   First Deputy Police Commissioner Patrick Kelleher defended the
police actions. ``They had a right to gather,'' he said of the
marchers. ``But once they left the sidewalk they were endangering
the motorists, they were endangering the pedestrians. And we were
forced to make arrests.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who rarely minces his words when it
comes to civil disturbances, struck a conciliatory tone when asked
about the protest. ``It's a very worthy cause,'' he said on Monday
night in Nashua, N.H., where he was visiting. ``I can understand
why they are so outraged and upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Marchers held aloft signs that said ``Stop Hate Crimes,''
``Homophobia Kills'' and ``Where Is Your Rage?'' Many marchers said
they were marching not only to protest the killing of Shepard but
also to call attention to the problem of anti-gay bias crimes in
New York City, where reports of such attacks have risen 78 percent
so far this year over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``As lesbian and gay people, we know that Matthew Shepard is
only the tip of the iceberg,'' said Sara Pursley, an organizer.
``We are people who live every day knowing that this could happen
to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The size of the march appeared to surprise both the loose-knit
group of people who organized it and the police. Kelleher said that
the police called in more officers from all five boroughs when the
trouble began. ``We increased the number of people significantly to
put it back under control,'' he said on Moonday night.

SHOT IN THE ARM  
 DEVILS HOPE FOR BOOST WITH QB SWITCH 
</HEADLINE>
 STATE-QB-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In what may prove to be the most important audible of the
season, Arizona State Coach Bruce Snyder named Chad Elliott as
starting quarterback for Thursday's game against Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder said he hopes the redshirt freshman can salvage the
season for a team off to a disappointing 2-4 start. It marks the
end, at least temporarily, of a mystifying effort by sophomore Ryan
Kealy, whose accuracy and decision-making has fallen far short of
his impressive 1997 debut.
</P>
<P>
   After benching Kealy for Elliott in a 28-9 loss to Notre Dame on
Oct. 10, Snyder did some soul-searching before meeting with all of
his quarterbacks individually Sunday and breaking the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``He basically told me he thought about this a lot, and he
decided on me to be the starter right now,'' Elliott said. ``He
said he thought it would give us the best opportunity to win games
and get back on track. He said go out there and have a good time
and play like I have before.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott's reaction?
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to play it cool,'' he said. ``I hid my smile and then
called my dad the first thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kealy, understandably, was somber after Monday's practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fine,'' he said. ``He's a great quarterback and hopefully
he'll lead these guys to a couple of wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was it fair? Yeah, it's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Kealy said he'll be ready if called to come in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be prepared to play, but I probably won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott has played in five games, completing 26 of 48 pass
attempts for 249 yards, one touchdown and one interception. Kealy
was 78 of 143 with eight touchdowns and seven interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott played most of ASU's game against Southern California
after Kealy suffered a concussion and the entire fourth quarter
against Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott's strength may be his deep ball. Whether he proves as
accurate as Kealy, who was particularly effective with mid-range
passes during his peak last season, remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He throws a real nice deep ball,'' wide receiver Lenzie
Jackson said. ``He just kind of hangs it up there, a real tight
spiral, and gives you a chance to run up under it.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Elliott, ``I like throwing it to these guys because they'll
go up and get it for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott came to ASU from Sacramento's Grant High School, an
inner-city school he transferred to after his junior year because
he liked its program. He threw for 3,150 yards, 47 touchdowns and
three interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   He is confident, although Snyder suggested Monday that it has
been portrayed unfairly as arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's real confident when he comes in there. You can tell he's
not nervous,'' Jackson said. ``You wouldn't be able to tell he's a
freshman. We're all confident that he's going to get us the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Elliott, ``You have to have confidence to perform at this
level, or you're in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Confidence is something Kealy appears to have lacked recently.
How this decision will affect him is unknown. But surely he has
dwelled upon the ramifications if Elliott continues to play well.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott's performance will be under scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evaluation we've just gone through is probably ongoing,''
Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   On Kealy's psyche, Snyder said, ``My job as a head coach is to
care about each player. I know how Ryan is and how emotional he is.
I care about him as I would anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said, ``He's handling it real well out here in practice.
I feel for him, but he's a team player so I'm sure he'll take it in
stride.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott has longed for this opportunity. He has suggested in the
past that he would consider transferring if he felt a starting job
wasn't in his future.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford is probably a good starting debut for him. The Cardinal
ranks last in the Pac-10 in pass, rush and scoring defense. &QL; 
Notes &QL; 
Other personnel changes for Thursday's game include Thomas Schmidt
replacing Troy Davis at right tackle. Snyder said it was a move
based on performance.
</P>
<P>
   Kickoff for ASU's Oct. 31 game against Washington State has been
set at 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Stephen Trejo is expected to play against Stanford
but will return to the inside after spending much of the season
outside. &QL;

TYSON MAY BARK, BUT BITE IS GONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Mike Tyson stopped and smelled the flowers, would the flowers
be afraid?
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, the answer was yes. Every living thing feared
Tyson, the ghetto kid, the ex-delinquent from Brooklyn. Iron Mike
was the ``baddest man on the planet.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in his career, Tyson knocked out Marvis Frazier in 30
seconds. Don King can't clear his throat in 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, 1986, Tyson met Trevor Berbick for the
heavyweight title. When the bell sounded, the 20-year-old
challenger launched himself from his corner like a missile from an
aircraft carrier. Berbick, whose name sounds like that of a
newscaster on the BBC, was doomed.
</P>
<P>
   The fight lasted two rounds. Tyson threw 106 punches. He set up
Berbick with a right behind the ear and then anesthetized him with
a left hook to the head.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest heavyweight champ in history described the punch as
``murder.''
</P>
<P>
   He exploded on the scene like no fighter since the young poet
Cassius Clay. But there was nothing lyrical about Tyson's
pugilistic style. He was as swift and efficient as a butcher.
</P>
<P>
   Black satin trunks. No socks. Tattooed biceps. During prefight
instructions, he fixed opponents with a malevolent glare. He sensed
their fear _ he could smell it. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Naked aggression &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tyson knocked out Michael Spinks in 91 seconds. As if
anticipating his fate, Spinks wore kneepads into the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson was, and is, a psychological study. ``We fear that naked
aggression,'' Bill Hoffman, a psychiatrist, once said. ``Tyson has
that pure animal brutality in the ring.''
</P>
<P>
   A convicted rapist, Tyson's celebrity grew. So did his
box-office appeal. When he returned to the ring after serving three
years in prison, he became the most popular villain in boxing
history _ more fearsome and far better known than former
prizefighter Wilbert Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vampire'' Johnson didn't wear a robe, favoring a black satin
cape. He would enter the ring in a coffin and drink red-colored
water.
</P>
<P>
   Scary? Buster Mathis Jr. stood nose to nose with Tyson and
contemplated the violence that was about to pour out. Buster didn't
last long, although he did remain upright longer than Peter
McNeeley.
</P>
<P>
   In Tyson's first fight as a free man, he KO'd McNeeley in 89
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson was bad, bad to the bone. He cultivated an aura of
invincibility. His fights ended so quickly that King _ his promoter
and boxing's carnival barker _ felt it necessary to point out to
the paying public, some of whom felt they weren't getting their
money's worth, ``A good fight does not involve longevity.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Bruno nervously made the sign of the cross as he walked
reluctantly to the ring. Tyson knocked him out in three rounds and
won the World Boxing Council heavyweight title. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Meeting his match &QL; 
 &QL; 
Then Tyson met a man who didn't fear him, who didn't cower, didn't
flinch. Evander Holyfield knocked Tyson down. The fight ended in
the 11th round.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield won again seven months later when Tyson, losing, bit
Holyfield's ears and was disqualified.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson got his boxing license back Monday. If he isn't convicted
on assault charges stemming from a car accident, he will return to
the ring, perhaps as early as December.
</P>
<P>
   But he isn't the same.
</P>
<P>
   He never will be.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield stripped away Iron Mike's mythical aura. He exposed
him as mere flesh and blood _ mortal, vulnerable, beatable.
</P>
<P>
   If Tyson hadn't bitten Holyfield, his career might be over.
Strangely, because he did, Tyson remains a big attraction. A
celebrity, in a weird way. A curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he can reinvent himself. But he won't have the fear factor
in his corner like he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``His toughest fight will be the first opponent who is not
afraid of him,'' ex-champ Larry Holmes said. ``Tyson's hole card
has been tipped. Holyfield showed how to to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't run.
</P>
<P>
   Stand your ground.
</P>
<P>
   Box.

JARRETT DRIVES ON SPEEDWAYS, NOT FAIRWAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ned Jarrett did what any parent might do with a scratch golfer
in the family. He tried steering his son toward Pebble Beach, not
Daytona Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dale was very, very good,'' the elder Jarrett said. ``He was a
zero handicap, and we thought he had the potential to be on the PGA
Tour. So did a lot of other local professional golfers.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I personally knew how tough it was in racing. I knew the
sacrifices he would have to make, and I just didn't want to see him
have to go through the long period of time it would take to into
NASCAR (Winston Cup) racing. It's a hard road.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, for stock-car fans, Dale Jarrett didn't listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I could think about was working on race cars and then
driving them. I knew I'd never be happy without at least giving
racing a try,'' said Dale, who won the equivalent of Arizona's 4A
high school golf championship as a senior in 1974 at Newton-Conover
(N.C.) High School, where he also was the football team's starting
quarterback, the baseball team's starting first baseman and one of
two starting forwards on the basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   Although the younger Jarrett turned down golf scholarships to
Alabama and South Carolina and football scholarships to two smaller
four-year colleges, he's never thought twice about the decision.
</P>
<P>
   And after twice winning the Daytona 500, last season's Dura
Lube/Kmart 500 at Phoenix International Raceway _ he will try for a
repeat on Sunday _ and 15 other races in a Winston Cup career that
began in earnest 11 years ago, it's not likely Jarrett will ever
look back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Senior PGA Tour? I can't ever imagine me doing that,''
said Jarrett, 41. ``I don't play that much anymore. (Sponsor
commitments) and racing keep me so busy, I just don't have the
time. I probably play to about a 10 or 11 handicap now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racing still comes first for me.''
</P>
<P>
   No kidding.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Jarrett's perseverance almost was rewarded with his
first Winston Cup championship. He won a career-high seven races
and finished a scant 14 points behind series champion Jeff Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett thought this season might be even glossier. But finishes
of 34th and 40th in two of the first three races put him in a hole
too steep to completely overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Although three wins, 12 top-three finishes and 17 top-five
finishes have rallied him to third in the driver's standings with
three remaining races, Jarrett knows its unlikely he'll climb any
higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you'd have to give us an eight (on a scale of 1 to
10),'' said Jarrett, who trails second place Mark Martin by 262
points and is mathematically eliminated from chasing down Gordon.
``It wasn't the year we were looking for. We thought we'd be
battling for the championship. But it's still been a good year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is Mark Martin's had a 9.5 season, and Jeff Gordon
has had a 10. It's hard to give someone a perfect score, but
(Gordon's team has) done all the right things.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett blamed the rough start and the introduction of the Ford
Taurus as two major reasons for the slight decline on the driver
pedestal. But the main enemy, Jarrett said, has been the engine
department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some uncharacteristic engine problems,'' Jarrett
said. ``That's what's hurt us the most. It's kind of strange
because it's really our strong point.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we've definitely had our work cut out for us trying to get
the Taurus to run like we wanted it to. Then, at other times, we've
put ourselves in holes where we really had to play catch-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Indianapolis (in the Brickyard 400), we got four laps down.
We ended up making those laps up, but we still finished way down
(16th).''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Indianapolis also showcased Jarrett's unwavering mettle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't won as much this year and they're further down on
the points ladder, but I think Dale's done some of his best driving
this season,'' said the elder Jarrett, a two-time NASCAR driving
champion. ``He drove his heart out at Indianapolis and finished on
the lead lap. I thought that was a tremendous driving feat.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Patrick, who for 25 years has been Newton-Conover's football
coach, isn't surprised Jarrett refused to throw in the towel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dale was a natural athlete and a natural leader when he was
here,'' Patrick said. ``He led by example. He never gave up at
anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really was a `Cool Hand Luke.' '' &QL;

JETS BEAT PATRIOTS

 FBN-PATRIOTS-JETS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

   FOXBOROUGH _ The Curse of the Tuna continues.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Parcells and Curtis Martin left their former home field
with ear-to-ear smiles last night, while Pete Carroll, who was on
the verge of receiving the respect he seems to deserve, walked away
sad.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells and Jets defensive coordinator Bill Belichick put
together a tremendous game plan, holding the Patriots scoreless in
the second half as New York posted a 24-14 victory that
disappointed 60,062 fans at Foxboro Stadium and left a locker room
full of Patriots shell-shocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea what went wrong,'' lamented Patriots defensive
tackle Chad Eaton. ``I get sick and tired of hearing it was because
Bill Parcells was standing over at the other side. That wasn't it
at all. We haven't been able to win on Monday night. Maybe it's a
Monday night jinx or something.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we have too many young players who still don't
understand what it takes to win a big game like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Safety Willie Clay said, ``Our goal was to win all of our home
games. But we still have another chance to beat them at their
place. It's disappointing because we were ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets trailed at halftime, 14-10, but scored twice in the
fourth quarter as quarterback Vinny Testaverde, who is now 3-0 as a
starter, completed 22 of 32 passes for 294 yards and three
touchdowns, two of them 1-yard throws to tight end Kyle Brady.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde did everything Drew Bledsoe couldn't do. The Patriots
quarterback threw a costly interception into the end zone in the
third quarter that seemed to turn the momentum the Jets' way.
Bledsoe (18 of 30 for 206 yards) had taken the Patriots from their
4 to the Jets' 18 before Bledsoe, intending to hit Shawn Jefferson
in the left corner of the end zone, underthrew the pass and had it
picked off by Aaron Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``They borrowed some stuff from the Broncos, where they rolled
over the safeties on the weak side,'' said Bledsoe. ``They didn't
use much else to surprise us beyond that. The fact is, I missed on
the play in the end zone and we committed too many penalties (11
for 71 yards) along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' defense again had problems on third down (the Jets
converted 62 percent), while New York played a containment game
(they allowed Robert Edwards 104 yards on 22 carries).
</P>
<P>
   After a scoreless third quarter, the Jets took their first lead
since the first quarter when they drove 80 yards on 17 plays and
ate up 8:35 of the clock. Testaverde's 1-yard pass to Brady _ after
Martin was stuffed on first and goal _ put the Jets ahead, 17-14.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' hopes of a comeback went up in smoke on the Jets'
next possession when Testaverde threw a 43-yard bomb down the right
sideline to Dedric Ward, who beat Chris Canty and caught the ball
on the fly, making it 24-14.
</P>
<P>
   The first half was one in which both the new back and the old
back showed their talents. Edwards carried 16 times for 67 yards
and caught two passes for 15 yards, while his predecessor, Martin,
carried 11 times for 62 yards for the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   But the game couldn't have started _ or ended _ any worse for
New England.
</P>
<P>
   On the first series, Bledsoe threw too low to Shawn Jefferson,
too long for Terry Glenn, and then got sacked by Anthony Pleasant.
Three and out.
</P>
<P>
   Then the reliable Tom Tupa, punting into a stiff wind, lined a
37-yarder, his shortest kick of the season, to the Jets' 44.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Testaverde made it look easy. He connected on passes
of 20, 14, and 11 yards, while Martin, on his first carry against
his former teammates, avoided a 5-yard loss on a missed tackle by
Lawyer Milloy and rambled 6 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The drive culminated with a 1-yard pass from Testaverde to Brady
for a touchdown on a questionable call. It appeared that linebacker
Ted Johnson had forced a fumble before the ball crossed the goal
line, and replays supported that, but the score stood.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots were not demoralized by this. Any notion that
Parcells was getting into Bledsoe's head was dismissed when Bledsoe
orchestrated a well-balanced 76-yard drive that culminated in a
gutsy fourth-and-1 touchdown by Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards had been stopped cold on third and 1, but on fourth down
Bledsoe pitched it left and Edwards collided head on with
linebacker James Farrior before bouncing into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards has scored touchdowns in each of his first six NFL
games, an unprecedented achievement in the league.
</P>
<P>
   During the drive, Bledsoe connected on an 18-yard pass to Troy
Brown over the middle, but the big play was a 29-yard gain by Ben
Coates. Bledsoe threw a bullet that went between the hands of
linebacker Pepper Johnson to Coates. The tight end hurdled a
defender to get to the 4-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets got going again from their 30, seemingly moving at
will. But the Patriots did make three superb defensive plays.
</P>
<P>
   First, Willie McGinest chased down Testaverde for a 9-yard sack
that moved the ball back from the Patriots' 18 to the 27.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as the second quarter began, Milloy sneaked in on a
delayed blitz and pulverized Testaverde for an 8-yard loss, forcing
third and 27.
</P>
<P>
   Martin ran around right end for a 14-yard gain to set up a
38-yard field goal attempt by John Hall. But Eaton blocked the
attempt, creating a sense of deja vu. In a Monday night meeting
here last September, former Patriot Mike Jones blocked a 34-yard
attempt by Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots took over at their 23, and with another very
patient drive, went 77 yards in 5:33. A 6-yard touchdown reception
by backup tight end Lovett Purnell with 8:22 remaining gave them
their first lead, 14-7.
</P>
<P>
   On the last play of the half, Hall kicked a 23-yard field goal
to bring the Jets within 4.

BOCHY BALL A SERIES BUST FOR SAN DIEGO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ In the wee hours after the Bronx massacre, a
television flickered in a New York tavern.
</P>
<P>
   First, there was a clip of Paul O'Neill destroying a water
cooler. Next, old footage of Paul O'Neill smashing his bat against
a dugout wall.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a shot of Paul O'Neill sitting on the edge of the
bench, next to the manager, staring forward with a pacified gaze.
Leaning back, Joe Torre was doing all the talking. While there was
no audio available, you could almost hear the wisdom. And you could
tell O'Neill was listening to every word.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget the double switch,'' one fan said aloud. ``Now
``that's'' managing.''
</P>
<P>
   As the World Series threatens to end with a disgusted click of
the remote, a dull thud to cap off a season of fireworks, the
contrast in managers is striking.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost unheard of that a manager in New York _ the man who
must sit where Casey Stengel sat, who hears the jeers and the
terrible things they say about your mother, who is subjected to
scrutiny found nowhere else on the planet _ has created one of the
most serene environments in baseball. There is no controversy, no
clash of egos, just the steady hum of professionalism.
</P>
<P>
   In the other dugout . . .
</P>
<P>
   Well. Is there any other manager who has adversely affected his
team's chances in a World Series quite like Bruce Bochy?
</P>
<P>
   In Game 1, he lifted Kevin Brown at the first whiff of trouble.
In Game 2, he went the other route, stringing along his pitcher
until the Padres were getting their Ashby kicked.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 1, after Donne Wall flamed out, he brought in Mark
Langston, a 38-year-old lefty against whom opposing lefties have
hit .360 this season. Langston loaded the bases before surrendering
a grand slam to Tino Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was Bochy's decision,'' Padres pitching coach Dave
Stewart said. ``I don't know why we left him in as long as we
did.''
</P>
<P>
   In Game 1, Bochy claimed a sinus infection led to Brown's quick
hook. In Game 2, he said Andy Ashby had contracted a similar virus,
one he knew about before the game. Yet, he let Ashby linger for 66
pitches in 2 innings, yielding 10 hits and seven runs.
</P>
<P>
   A complete flip-flop in logic in the span of 24 hours. And both
times, the wrong baseball decision.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of two losses came a string of excuses. Brown had a
bruised shin to go along with his sinus problem. Ashby had a virus
and _ we're not kidding here _ mechanical problems caused by
tendinitis in his left buttock.
</P>
<P>
   The real diagnosis: The Padres and their manager are shriveling
in the moment.
</P>
<P>
   While Bochy's reputation has spiraled from unnoticed genius to
buffoon in the span of a week, Torre has gone the opposite
direction. Two years ago, he was the sentimental favorite, the guy
who finally won a World Series after 35 years while his brother
awaited a heart transplant. Now, at age 58, he has risen to the top
of his profession.
</P>
<P>
   He is in tune with the pulse of his players, knows every mood in
the clubhouse, has shown an uncanny knack when laying out his
cards. From the surprise start of Ricky Ledee to El Duque's start
in Game 2, the results speak for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In the other dugout, the manager is being questioned by his own
pitching coach. And if the Padres fail to recover, they'll go down
as a team that twice ruined a marquee match-up. In 1984, it
should've been the Cubs and Tigers. This season, the Braves
would've surely provided better drama.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is an unpredictable game. The Reds somehow swept the
heavily favored A's in 1990. The Royals somehow rallied from a 3-1
deficit to clip the Cardinals in 1985. The Yankees dropped the
first two at home before snatching four straight from the Braves in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres know there is precedent. Problem is, the gap between
these two teams was enormous when the Series started. And thanks to
their manager, it's widening by the moment. &QL;

 TUNA LEAVES BAD TASTE FOR PATRIOTS FANS
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By Dan Shaughnessy  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ We might as well admit it: He is never going away.
Bill Parcells might coach in New York, New Orleans, or New Delhi,
but he will never be far from the New England mind.
</P>
<P>
   He is like nasty traffic on the Expressway, northeasters in
February, and green flies at Crane Beach. He is like ... the New
York Yankees _ guaranteed to torture New England sports fans for
eternity.
</P>
<P>
   So why were we so surprised when the Tuna's downtrodden Jets
came to town last night and embarrassed the muscle-flexing
Patriots, 24-14, under the glare of ``Monday Night Football''?
</P>
<P>
   Nights like these assure that Parcells and Bob Kraft, a k a the
Bonfire and the Vanity, will keep their silent war going into the
next century. The Tuna tried not to be smug after winning, but
admitted, ``I'm very pleased to come in here and beat these guys,
obviously.''
</P>
<P>
   Old ``Press Corner'' Kraft looked as if he'd spent four days
locked in a room with Massachusetts Speaker of the House Thomas
Finneran. Poor Bob. He runs his Super Bowl coach out of town and
Parcells takes a 1-15 team and beats the Patriots twice in three
meetings. If not for a low kick by John Hall last year, Tuna would
be 3-0 against the vastly superior Patriots. Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   For Kraft, the price of being the star of his own team keeps
going up. Certainly it looked like everything was going his way
before Tuna III. The Patriots had ripped off four straight wins,
including a shredding of the estimable Kansas City Chiefs. Robert
Edwards and draft picks in exchange for Curtis Martin was looking
darn good and Kraft's courting of the media produced
round-the-clock infomercials disguised as news.
</P>
<P>
   But it all came apart under the watchful eye of Michaels,
Dierdorf, and Esiason. Everybody knows New England has more talent
than the Jets. So what is Patriot Nation to think? How to explain a
10-point whupping at home on national television?
</P>
<P>
   Patriots quarterback Drew Bledsoe said his team wanted this
badly because it was ``Monday Night Football,'' because the game
was at home, and because it was against a division rival. He didn't
say anything about the Tuna, but that's what made the game special
and that's what took New England players out of their game again.
</P>
<P>
   The Martin-Edwards matchup proved to be even. Martin had 107
yards on 28 carries, while the impressive rookie Edwards came
through with 104 yards on 22 carries. But it had to be infuriating
for Patriots coach Pete Carroll to lose again to Parcells,
especially after Pistol Pete had been quoted as saying that
everything the Tuna says is a crock.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells would not gloat. It's one of the maddening things about
the Tuna. He comes back here and sticks it to Kraft, then says all
sorts of nice things.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to win anywhere, but to beat the division leaders on
the road is a good feeling,'' he said. ``But I have a warm feeling
for this place. And the fans. I mean that. When I first came here,
you could hold archery practice in the stadium during games. I'm
proud to see what's here for fan support in New England.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe last week compared the Patriots-Jets rivalry to the Red
Sox-Yankees century-long Holy War. It has grown to all of that and
more. Patriots-Jets games have become a referendum on local sports
fans' way of life. Just as you are a Republican or Democrat, you
are a Bill Guy or a Bob Guy. And most of Patriot Nation is
populated by Bob Guys who hate Bill and bring their venom to the
stadium. That's why this loss hurt so much throughout New England.
</P>
<P>
   The big pantload with the big teeth _ the man who allegedly
ruined Super Bowl week and then stole Martin _ did it to New
England again.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots may go on to beat Miami and Pittsburgh and San
Francisco. But New England fans are going to circle Dec. 27 on
their calendars. That's the final game of the season and it's at
the Meadowlands against the ... New ... York ... Jets. God help the
Patriots if they need that game for playoff positioning. The Tuna
will be standing on the sideline, pretending it's just another
game, dying to stick it to Kraft one more time.

JETS HAD COORDINATED EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
 FBN-McDONOUGH COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ On the last day of practice for last night's game,
Bill Parcells shut down the Jets' workout early and threw his team
off the field. They stunk that bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you guys can't get ready to play a division opponent on
Monday night, then you better start looking for another job,''
Parcells lashed out.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no Jets in the unemployment line this morning. All
of them can walk up to the paymaster and get compensated in full
for the whipping they put on a stunned Patriots team last night.
</P>
<P>
   The game turned in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a bad second period,'' said Parcells. ``Penalties,
mistakes, missed opportunities. It was bad. But we played very well
in the second half. We stayed aggressive, and it really helped
us.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a wonderful chess match between the teams'
coordinators.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, New England offensive coordinator Ernie
Zampese had the edge on Jets defensive coordinator Bill Belichick.
It turned around in the second half when the Jets shut out the
Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very hard to stop,'' said Belichick. ``In the first
half, Ernie had a real nice mix going. They kept us off balance
with the way they were able to run the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing is a guessing game. You can't focus on any one
guy on their offense. You have to move the strength of your
coverage around. Some plays we doubled (Ben) Coates. Some we
doubled (Terry) Glenn. Some we doubled the other wide receivers. I
have such great respect for all of those guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big factor for us was getting some hits on Drew (Bledsoe).
If you let him sit back there the whole game and throw in rhythm,
he will pick you apart. At key points, we got some hits on him. We
had to blitz him to do it, but at times it worked for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots seemed to have control of the game with 2:30 left
in the third quarter. They were sitting on a 14-10 lead with third
and 11 at the Jets' 18, easy field goal range for Adam Vinatieri.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe, out of a shotgun formation, went to throw. Mo Lewis,
the Jets' best linebacker, came on a blitz and jumped at Bledsoe,
forcing him to alter a pass intended for Shawn Jefferson in the
back corner of the end zone. Bledsoe had to put an arc on the pass,
which allowed Aaron Glenn to recover and make the interception.
Instead of being ahead, 21-10 or 17-10, the Patriots were still up,
14-10, and New York had the ball on its 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big sequence for us,'' said Parcells. ``Glenn's
play was big. Then we controlled the ball for 18 plays, ran all
that time off the clock (8:35) and got the go-ahead touchdown.''
</P>
<P>
   New York went up, 17-14, six minutes into the fourth quarter
when tight end Kyle Brady caught his second 1-yard TD pass for the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Patriots had plenty of time. But they stalled at
their 34 and had to punt.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Parcells and his staff had to make their most critical
decision of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom said to sit on the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were five minutes left,'' said Parcells, ``and I told
our guys we were going to stay aggressive. I wanted to put some
distance between them and us. I didn't want to give the ball back
to Bledsoe (with just a 3-point lead).''
</P>
<P>
   On first down, the Jets surprised the Patriots by again throwing
to Brady, a seldom-used receiver. The Patriots weren't paying any
attention to him, and the Jets took advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays later, the Jets' staff made the call that put the game
out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think our guy (Dedric) Ward can run a lot faster than most
of the guys they had covering him,'' said Parcells. ``We wanted to
get him singled up in coverage if we could. It just turned out that
they blitzed on the play and Ward ran by his guy (Chris Canty), and
Vinny (Testaverde) made a great throw. That was big. Very big.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point in the conversation, Dan Henning, the former
Boston College coach now with the Jets' offensive staff, walked
past and said, ``I'll say big. That takes a lot of guts to go for
something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the staff was for it. Some wanted to sit on the ball
and hope the defense could hold on. But Parcells wanted all of it,
on this night that will go down as one of the sweetest victories he
has had in his long career. Forget that stuff about beating a
division opponent on the road. There was more to that in this one,
and every football fan in New England is smart enough to realize
it.

WILLIAMS SHOULD STAY IN BRONX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ No offense, Valley residents, but Bernie Williams
should not become a Diamondbacks outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   He can't. Not if he wants to maintain the status he has achieved
to this point.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody who plays center field for the New York Yankees should
ever consider leaving the Bronx, where the most storied franchise
in sports plays its games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's our Number 1 priority,'' Yankees General Manager Brian
Cashman said. ``We want to make him a Yankee for life.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, a Yankee since he was drafted, will be given a choice,
and he should think twice if he believes he can match what he has
now by going elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Being a Yankees center fielder, at least a great one,
automatically links a player with Joe DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle.
It's simply the best position to play in baseball. It is cloaked
with unbridled elegance.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, but being the Diamondbacks center fielder next year only
connects you to Devon White. For Williams, it should be a
no-brainer. Staying in New York and wearing the pinstripes keeps
Williams in select company.
</P>
<P>
   Little kids dream of playing center field for the Yankees. It's
a position that elevates a player into a stratosphere that no other
organization can match.
</P>
<P>
   Staying with the Yankees means Williams will have a chance to
play in the World Series every year. Joining the Diamondbacks means
his social calendar will be fairly wide open every October.
</P>
<P>
   Being a Diamondbacks center fielder may one day hold a special
status. If so, it should be because the club brought along its own
player, not one from another organization. DiMaggio and Mantle were
Yankees before they reached the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   It appears Williams, who declined to speak about the subject,
will indeed become a free agent once the World Series ends. That's
all right if he's simply trying to leverage Yankees boss George
Steinbrenner for more money.
</P>
<P>
   But if Williams is serious about leaving, whether it be to play
in downtown Phoenix or elsewhere, he would be making the mistake of
his career.
</P>
<P>
   It's quite possible that some outside force is behind Williams
leaving the Bronx. If, say, his wife wants out of New York City,
for the sake of their family, well, that justifies his leaving.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams and his wife have lived in New York City for years.
As Puerto Ricans living in the city with a larger Puerto Rican
population than even San Juan, he enjoys a revered status that is
unmatched anywhere on the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to sit here and tell Bernie what he should do,''
said Yankees shortstop and Williams' friend Derek Jeter. ``But none
of us are in Bernie's shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams _ at least his agent, Scott Boras _ wants megastar
money in his next contract. This is where the situation becomes a
bit messy. The Yankees last multiyear proposal to Williams was a
five-year $37 million offer made one week before the Diamondbacks
virtually gave the same deal (five years for $34 million) to
shortstop Jay Bell, whom Boras also represents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbeknownst to us, Boras already knew the Bell contract was
coming down the pike,'' Cashman said. ``It definitely affected
where we stood.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams is a player whose skills are just a hair below the
superstar category. Make no mistake, he's a tremendous player, but
on the scale between above-average major leaguer and superstar,
Williams falls below the superstar line.
</P>
<P>
   Which still makes for a fabulous player. There is little he
cannot do on a field, but he is not quite on the same level as Ken
Griffey Jr., Barry Bonds and Alex Rodriguez. Herein lies the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   If you're the Yankees, do you bend your own rules, albeit skewed
when measuring them against most every other club, and give
Williams $10 million a year when you know he's not quite in that
category?
</P>
<P>
   The problem is someone out there _ quite possibly Jerry
Colangelo _ might be willing to twist the measuring stick
(Colangelo proved that with the Bell contract).
</P>
<P>
   Williams occupies the famed corner locker stall inside the
Yankee clubhouse, the one previously taken by Don Mattingly. It's
the locker that is basically passed down to the greatest of the
Yankees. It's inhabitants before Mattingly were Dave Righetti, Dave
Winfield and Ron Guidry.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has reached a certain exalted status with the Yankees.
If he leaves, he blows it.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, but wearing purple pinstripes with a turquoise cap
doesn't quite measure up to donning blue pinstripes.
</P>
<P>
   There IS something unparalleled in sports about that distinctive
``NY'' on a uniform. Walking away from it, especially by choice,
would be regrettable for Williams. Maybe not next year, but
regrettable nonetheless. &QL;

PLUMMER READY TO PUT BEST FEET FORWARD  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the Snake has gone out of Jake Plummer, it's not by design.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer, who's ability to improvise on the run made him a star
at Arizona State, suddenly seems reluctant to slither and slide as
the Cardinals' starting quarterback. And when Plummer has left the
pocket out of necessity, he has forced throws.
</P>
<P>
   The result, predictably, has been bad. Plummer threw two
interceptions, his 10th and 11th this season against six
touchdowns, Sunday in a 34-7 loss to the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer said teams are defensing him differently than last
season, when he was able to improvise for some big plays. Defensive
backs and linebackers aren't leaving coverage to go after him.
</P>
<P>
   And Plummer said Monday that he needs to stop trying to make
huge plays every time with his arm and take what his nimble feet
can get him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most times when I've gotten out of the pocket, I haven't seen
a lot of guys coming after me,'' Plummer said. ``They're chasing me
from behind, but you get those big plays out of the pocket when you
bust out of there and the (defensive back) or linebacker sees you
running and wants to come get a tackle or a sack. That leaves his
guy behind him wide open.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not coming up, and hopefully, I can make the better
decision to tuck the ball and run. I'm a good runner. I can get
some yards. If I get five yards, even if a guy is open, the drive
is still alive. I don't make a bad decision.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be just fine with Coach Vince Tobin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've ever told him not to do that (run),''
Tobin said Monday. ``Jake has got to where he is in his career by
being a certain kind of quarterback. Part of his success has come
from his ability to run the football and pick up vital first downs,
vital yardage. You also make big plays by being able to throw it on
the run. That's where it puts double pressure on the defense.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Where's the D? &QL; 
 &QL; 
While most of the focus after Sunday's debacle was on Plummer and
the club's offensive woes, the defense's performance might be more
alarming.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants had the NFL's 30th-ranked offense going into the game
but gained 390 total offensive yards against an Arizona defense
that had been playing so impressively that fans and media have been
searching for an appropriate nickname.
</P>
<P>
   So much for that. The Giants razed the Cactus Curtain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a defense has to be evaluated over the long haul,''
Tobin said. ``A lot of times we're too quick to put a good label or
a bad label on anything whether it's the defense or the offense or
the special teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to evaluate them on how you do over the course of the
year. We had a couple of pretty good ballgames. We've got some good
players on defense, but it's still how you do consistently against
all the different variety of offenses you're going to see in the
National Football League. You've got to be able to come up strong
against all of them. We didn't come up very strong against the
Giants.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Getting Bye &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Cardinals (3-4) have until Nov. 1 to lick their wounds thanks
to a bye week. And it couldn't have come at a better time for their
health, both physical and mental.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin said he hopes the Cardinals will have cornerback Tom
Knight (hamstring) and guard Chris Dishman (neck), running back
Adrian Murrell (leg) healthy by then. He also reported that
injuries to defensive end Simeon Rice (leg bruise) and Mark Smith
(ankle sprain) against the Giants are not serious.
</P>
<P>
   Returner/receiver Eric Metcalf (leg), defensive tackle Eric
Swann (arthritic knees) and receiver Rob Moore (foot) have been
playing, but also will benefit from the extra time off.

ART SKILLS BLOSSOM AS MIND DECLINES DURING DEMENTIA 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARL T. HALL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A rare form of mental illness can bring out
``startling artistic talents'' in adults with no previous creative
interest, brain researchers report.
</P>
<P>
   Art history is replete with examples of strong talents torn
apart by depression and other forms of mental disquietude _
hallmarks of tortured geniuses who, in the words of Lord Byron,
``by the dint of glass and vapor, discover stars, and sail in the
wind's eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, a new study shows that some unusual cases may be explained
by a genetic mutation linked to a condition known as frontotemporal
dementia.
</P>
<P>
   The disease typically strikes when people are in their 50s,
affecting a region of the brain that influences social behavior. It
accounts for about 10 percent of all cases of dementia, and differs
both in symptoms and brain chemistry from the much more widespread
dementias that are among the hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Lead author Bruce Miller of the University of California at San
Francisco, joined by colleagues at UCLA and UC Irvine, illustrated
the study, which appears in Tuesday's issue of the journal
Neurology. Accompanying the report are paintings and photography
done by people with dementia.
</P>
<P>
   In the five cases chosen for close scrutiny, mental illness
seems to have unleashed talents that had lain dormant _ opening
what the researchers called ``an unexpected window into the
artistic process.''
</P>
<P>
   Some parallels emerged between the late-blooming obsession with
artistic efforts shown by the patients and the life stories of
Vincent Van Gogh and Francisco de Goya, two painters whose work
``blossomed in midlife, when they spurned conventional rules of
society,'' the researchers noted.
</P>
<P>
   Frontotemporal dementia has been traced to a mutation in a gene
called tau, which leads to the destruction of a part of the cortex
used for speech and social skills but which may spare regions for
visual perception.
</P>
<P>
   Patients stopped talking, withdrew socially, became irritable,
developed odd obsessions and failed at memory tests. But in each of
the five case studies, the most severe problems were preceded by a
period of exceptional creativity.
</P>
<P>
   One middle-aged advertising executive developed a sudden
interest in photography, leaving his family behind to take
dangerous trips into Central America to get what he described as
the ``perfect'' image.
</P>
<P>
   He later took to carving wax miniatures from candle drippings.
Worsening mental function led to his being placed in a nursing
facility at age 56.
</P>
<P>
   A woman without artistic training signed up for art classes at
age 51, about the time she became uncomfortable in social settings.
She completed her first paintings at age 55, depicting rural scenes
from childhood, and continued to paint while her condition worsened
until she reached age 66. She died two years later of advanced
dementia.
</P>
<P>
   ``A break with social conventions is common among artists and
can lead to a freer, more creative output,'' the study concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Some so-called ``outsider artists'' seem to couple a distinctive
artistic style with a set of clinical hallmarks, such as social
disinhibition, hallucinations and ``little interest in the
teachings of others.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows whether such people may have a distinct form of
mental illness. Researchers noted that the ``mechanism for enhanced
artistic skills in these patients and outsider artists reported
previously remains a mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, experts said, creativity may not be so much a
direct product of a mental illness but rather part of the person's
way of coping with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a vulnerability that's part and parcel of having a
mental disorder,'' said Michael Faenza, president of the National
Mental Health Association in Alexandria, Va. ``A lot of times that
finds an outlet in different forms of art.''

   He later took to carving wax miniatures from candle drippings.
Worsening mental function led to his being placed in a nursing
facility at age 56.

<P>
   A woman without artistic training signed up for art classes at
age 51, about the time she became uncomfortable in social settings.
She completed her first paintings at age 55, depicting rural scenes
from childhood, and continued to paint while her condition worsened
until she reached age 66. She died two years later of advanced
dementia.

<P>
   ``A break with social conventions is common among artists and
can lead to a freer, more creative output,'' the study concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Some so-called ``outsider artists'' seem to couple a distinctive
artistic style with a set of clinical hallmarks, such as social
disinhibition, hallucinations and ``little interest in the
teachings of others.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows whether such people may have a distinct form of
mental illness. Researchers noted that the ``mechanism for enhanced
artistic skills in these patients and outsider artists reported
previously remains a mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, experts said, creativity may not be so much a
direct product of a mental illness but rather part of the person's
way of coping with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a vulnerability that's part and parcel of having a
mental disorder,'' said Michael Faenza, president of the National
Mental Health Association in Alexandria, Va. ``A lot of times that
finds an outlet in different forms of art.''

NBA SALARY RULING A VICTORY FOR OWNERS
</HEADLINE>
 RULING-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NBA owners seemed to have gained the upper hand in their labor
clash via the ruling Monday that they don't have to pay players
during the lockout.
</P>
<P>
   But after arbitrator John Feerick ruled that owners are not
responsible for paying almost $800 million to players with
guaranteed contracts during the lockout, the players have circled
the wagons because they fear that the season could be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt about it; the season's in jeopardy,'' Orlando guard
Penny Hardaway said. ``We're upset that we didn't win.''
</P>
<P>
   For players, who have been locked out since July 1, when owners
suspended the NBA collective bargaining agreement, the next move is
to meet Thursday at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas. Michael Jordan,
Patrick Ewing and Shaquille O'Neal are expected to be on hand when
decertification of the NBA Players Association and a new
counterproposal will be discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The owners are kind of sitting pretty now,'' San Antonio guard
Avery Johnson said. ``They feel they have all the power in their
hands. We have to see how to keep the owners negotiating.''
</P>
<P>
   Feerick's ruling, which affects 226 players, means that players
will begin missing paychecks if a settlement isn't reached by Nov.
15. That could affect the solidarity of members, but the players'
union claims to be more committed than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you thought we were zealous before, you should see us now,
because we're even more rabid,'' union executive director Billy
Hunter said. ``We're worlds apart, and our membership is committed
to not accepting a bad deal under any circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Most experts feel that a longer lockout favors owners, who will
receive a guaranteed $23 million per team from the television deal
signed a year ago. So how long will the players wait?
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't hold out as long as the owners, and everybody knows
it,'' said a Dallas-based agent who represents several players.
``The players may be right in this, but they are backed in a corner
now because soon the money they're used to won't be rolling in.''
</P>
<P>
   With the lockout in its 112th day and two weeks of the regular
season canceled, the sides remain at odds over the growth of player
salaries vs. league revenues. A week ago, players proposed a luxury
tax on lucrative contracts, and the owners submitted a counterbid
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their latest proposal is nothing more than a wolf in sheep's
clothing,'' Hunter said. ``It's a hard salary cap disguised as a
tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we have sufficient money to take us as far as we have
to go,'' Hunter said. ``We're convinced we'll be able to help the
minimum players who need us.''
</P>
<P>
   Exercising an early-out clause in the 1995 collective bargaining
agreement, owners began this lockout July 1 because player salaries
had begun eating up more than 52 percent of the league's total
revenue. At the heart of the struggle is a Larry Bird exception to
the cap, a loophole that allowed 24 of the league's 29 teams to
exceed the $31 million cap, Minnesota Timberwolves forward Kevin
Garnett to sign a six-year, $126 million contract, and Chicago
Bulls star Michael Jordan to earn $33 million.
</P>
<P>
   If and when an agreement is reached, teams say they need at
least three weeks to sign free agents and get players in shape.
Commissioner David Stern has said he is against a regular season of
less than 60 games.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the setback, Hunter said Feerick's ruling doesn't
drastically change his strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the same position today as we were Monday: We're not
on strike; we're locked out,'' he said. ``We're not inclined to
back down. But if owners continue to antagonize fans the way they
are doing, players being forced to miss a few paychecks may be the
least of all our worries. Our product may suffer enormous,
irreparable damage.''

GOOD BYE TIME: COWBOYS HAVE EXTRA WEEK TO FIND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Just how good are the Dallas Cowboys? And what
can be done about Kevin Smith's slumping play at cornerback?
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey plans to answer those questions and
more about the 4-3 Cowboys, who head into the bye week looking for
an ``identity'' after a 13-12 loss Sunday to the Bears.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' next game is against the Eagles on Monday night,
Nov. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think most teams around the .500 mark have an
identity,'' Gailey said. ``We are potentially a good team. How good
can we get? I don't know. It's going to take a little while longer
for us to establish ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   While the question of how good the Cowboys can get looms, at
least one question has been answered.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Troy Aikman, who has been out the past five weeks
with a broken collarbone, will re-establish himself as the starter
against the Eagles. And the Cowboys will use the bye week to try to
eliminate issues such as offensive inconsistency on third down and
in the red zone, issues that contributed to their downfall against
the Bears.
</P>
<P>
   However, the question that seems to be most troubling is what to
do about Smith. A week after saying Smith was not in jeopardy of
losing his starting spot, Gailey said the team will use the bye
week to evaluate Smith's role.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is becoming a repeated target of opposing quarterbacks,
who are shying away from throwing toward All-Pro cornerback Deion
Sanders. The Bears completed six passes against Smith on three
scoring drives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's obvious that Kevin's situation has come up,''
Gailey said. ``We will address that when the time comes with our
staff and with him. We will take a good hard look at where we are
and what we need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer acknowledged that
Smith, once considered one of the league's top cornerbacks, has
lost confidence. Smith has not had an interception in 19 games.
However, Zimmer does not favor making a change, saying the Cowboys
have to let Smith play through his bad time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to bench the guy,'' Zimmer said. ``Yes, I'm
concerned. But I don't care if I got Darrell Green over there. They
are not throwing at Prime. I told Kevin to keep his head up. I
believe in him 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Cowboys make a change, their first option is reserve
cornerback Kevin Mathis, who plays in nickel situations and has an
interception this season. However, the second-year Mathis is
inexperienced, and at 5-foot-9 might struggle as an every-down
player.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey and Zimmer said Smith's problem is mental. Pointing to
Smith's near interception of a touchdown pass to Chris Penn, Zimmer
said Smith improved against the Bears.
</P>
<P>
   The team hopes to continue improving in the second half of the
season as well. Though the Cowboys have the same record in 1998 as
they did after seven games in 1997, when they finished 6-10,
fullback Daryl Johnston said he has a better feeling about where
they are and where they can go.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, one of two teams in the league to rank in the top
10 in total offense and total defense, have seemingly answered many
preseason concerns _ especially on offense at wide receiver and on
the offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a much different feeling at 4-3,'' Johnston said. ``We've
improved in a lot of categories offensively. And we still have a
lot of room to improve. We are still trying to find ourselves as a
team. But we have the potential to be a good team.''
</P>
<P>
   Helping fuel that confidence is the expected return of Aikman,
who said he must get re-acclimated to the system after a five-week
hiatus. Though the Cowboys are happy with the job backup Jason
Garrett did in leading them to a 3-2 record, they believe that
Aikman can take them to the next level.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good thing is we're playing with Troy from now on,''
Cowboys receiver Michael Irvin said. ``Jason did a great job. My
hat's off to him, and we're glad to have him on our team. But we're
getting our quarterback back. We'll just have to see where we go
from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey is somewhat pleased that the Cowboys have a one-game lead
in the NFC East. What seems to be frustrating, however, is knowing
that they could be 5-2 if not for the mind-boggling loss to the
Bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like the bye to have been here at 5-2,'' Gailey said.
``But we are not. We are not pleased with 4-3, but we don't need to
be ashamed of 4-3.''

NEW RULES HAVE STARS ALTERING STYLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Injured center Joe Nieuwendyk, the Dallas Stars'
most valuable player last season, returned to practice full time
Monday and could return to game play as early as Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   But Nieuwendyk's return was overshadowed by an intense practice
that stressed strategic adjustments designed to reduce turnovers in
the defensive zone.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Ken Hitchcock presided over an early morning video session
then put players through 75 minutes of hard skating in preparation
for Tuesday's 7:30 game against the Calgary Flames at Reunion
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not meant to be a punishment day; it was meant to be
a hard practice,'' Hitchcock said of the workout that came on the
heels of a disappointing 4-3 loss to the Chicago Blackhawks on
Saturday. ``Today was a competitive, positional practice. Once our
competitive juices got flowing, I'm sure some guys had fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars players agreed, saying they needed the wakeup call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every team does, and we're no different,'' veteran defenseman
Craig Ludwig said. ``You get caught up in all the talent that's on
our team, but talented teams lose all the time. We have to stay
with what makes us win, and that's hard work.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock specifically points to the team's play while hunting
the puck and moving it out of the defensive zone after an
opponent's dump-in. With rule changes that pushed the goal line two
feet farther from the back wall to 13 feet and cracked down on
defending teams who were holding up forecheckers (one of the Stars'
strengths), the NHL is almost begging teams to dump the puck
instead of trying to make slick passes through the neutral zone and
into the offensive zone.
</P>
<P>
   With the puck dumped behind the net more, goalies more tentative
about going back to get it because of the extra space and opposing
forecheckers free to skate at full speed, defensemen now are under
more pressure than ever. They have to outrace forecheckers, get
possession of the puck and try to move it out from behind their
goal in the face of mounting pressure without making a mistake. One
wrong move and an opponent likely will get a prime scoring chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of teams are playing `red line and in,' and that makes
for a hellish time for defensemen,'' Hitchcock said. ``It's a much
more difficult game that we're in, much more.''
</P>
<P>
   So Hitchcock set about Monday to teach and prod his forwards
into helping the defensemen. Now, the first forward back often will
go after the puck as hard as the defenseman to ensure that
possession is gained.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forward has to go right back to help out; there can be no
hesitation,'' Hitchcock said. ``He's got to go back with the
assumption that the defenseman is not going to win the race.''
</P>
<P>
   That means forwards likely will cheat to the side of the
defense, breakouts will materialize slower and offensive
opportunities could be down. But Hitchcock and the players said
that doesn't have to be the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we know and what we have to get back to is that we create
our best opportunities off strong defense,'' Ludwig said. ``We want
to be the team that's forechecking hard in the other zone and
keeping the puck in their end. That's where our offense comes
from.''
</P>
<P>
   But just as important as knowing assignments and changing
positioning, Hitchcock said Monday players have to learn to be
aggressive in completing those assignments.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the game gets nasty and a little ugly, you have to want
to play in those games,'' he said of the Stars' tendency to shy
away from the battle against the Blackhawks. ``You can't run and
hide; you can't hope it's not there. You have to go out and compete
and have fun doing it.'' ALMOST HEALTHY
</P>
<P>
   Both Nieuwendyk and fellow center Brian Skrudland went through
full practices Monday. Nieuwendyk had reconstructive surgery on
both knees in the summer and has been working his way back. His
right knee is responding slower than his left, but Hitchcock said
he would like to test the knee this morning and push for a return
Thursday against the Phoenix Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   Skrudland had arthroscopic knee surgery two weeks ago. He said
he'd like to return Thursday, as well.

FEEL NO PITY FOR THE SICKLY MR. SUNSHINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Somehow, the idea of Kevin Brown puking his guts out
makes me smile.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, it probably makes me a bad person, but I just can't help
it. It's a Pavlovian response, conditioned from spending years
trying to exchange a few pleasantries with the former Rangers
right-hander.
</P>
<P>
   Reporter: ``Hey, Kevin, how are you today?''
</P>
<P>
   Brown: ``That's a stupid (bleeping) question.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporter: ``OK, nice to see you, too.''
</P>
<P>
   So now that the 1998 World Series has moved from one corner of
the country to the other, I admit I'm not exactly heartbroken to
hear that Brown is sick again _ it's his annual Fall Classic malady
_ except that it may provide him an alibi _ again _ for choking at
the worst possible time for his team.
</P>
<P>
   This autumn health crisis of his is becoming as automatic as
Brown sniping at the media for having the audacity to occupy the
same planet that he does.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, Brown pitched the Marlins into the World Series last
year, too, but when they desperately needed him to win a couple of
games in the Fall Classic, he was having his temperature checked.
</P>
<P>
   With a baby thermometer, we can only hope.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins won it anyway, but it was despite Brown's 0-2 record
and abysmal 8.18 earned-run average, not because he was the rock
they'd hoped he would be.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as now, Brown was ill with flu symptoms that left him weak
and shaky and as ornery as a 2-year-old who missed his nap time.
</P>
<P>
   Scratch that last one. That's Brown's attitude ``all'' the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone must have a voodoo doll out on me,'' Brown told
reporters after he gamely struggled through 61/3 innings in Game 1
of the Series and left with a 5-2 lead, only to see the Padres'
bullpen blow it almost before he'd had time to bite anyone's head
off. ``My timing has been really \Rlousy\S. It would be nice to
know what it's like to be healthy to start a World Series game.''
</P>
<P>
   Now don't start checking for Kevin Brown voodoo dolls stuck full
of straight pins in my luggage. I swear, somebody else is playing
pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey with him this time, and the list of
potential suspects, considering how many enemies he's made over the
years, is as long as that interminable flight from New York to San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I'd search Tom Schieffer's office first.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever, the Padres had better hope the sadist lets up soon,
because without Brown winning at least two games, they don't have a
prayer of beating the Yankees in this World Series. They may not
even get it back to New York.
</P>
<P>
   It is now debatable whether Brown will be well enough to start
Games 4 and 7 _ if the Pods can take it that far _ each time on
just three days' rest, though you know he'll go to the mound if
they have to wheel him out on a gurney.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever said the man isn't a competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has Brown come down with a bug, he has also spread it
among the Padres' pitching staff, proving what some of us have
claimed for a long time _ he should be kept in strict quarantine at
all times.
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't think a guy who soaks his heart in vinegar every
night could get sick so often.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that Brown entered the Series, much as he did last
October, being heralded as perhaps the best pitcher in the game at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   Not Roger Clemens. Not Pedro Martinez. Not Randy Johnson or Greg
Maddux or John Smoltz or any of those other hotshots.
</P>
<P>
   James Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   And he deserved it.
</P>
<P>
   Then came that relief appearance against the Braves in Game 5 of
the NLCS, when San Diego manager Bruce Bochy ignored his regular
relievers and brought his ace starter in from the bullpen to try to
nail it down, right then and there. It seemed like sound strategy
until Michael Tucker drove a Brown fastball into the right-field
seats for a three-run homer that wiped out the Padres' lead and
suddenly made Brown seem mortal again.
</P>
<P>
   He battled the Yankees in Game 1, despite admitting later to
being terribly fatigued from the first inning on, but he clearly
didn't have his best stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sank the ball, and he's obviously a good pitcher,'' a
Yankees official said, ``but we didn't see any of that 97 mph
fastball he's supposed to have. He certainly wasn't any better than
Clemens or Martinez or some of the guys we have on our staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Hold that thought, but if Brown is 100 percent Wednesday night,
the Yankees may yet see the pitcher who went head to head with
Johnson in the divisional series and totally dominated the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Don't count on it, though. He has a track record now, one that
says after Oct. 15, or thereabouts, the most likely place to find
Kevin Brown is on his knees, worshipping at the porcelain throne.
</P>
<P>
   Just to be sure, I'm on the way to the store right now to top
off my supply of straight pins.

LOCKOUT? NOT WHERE DR. J HOLDS COURT
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, you're not happy about the NBA lockout. You've got a
Basketball Jones that flares up this time of year and simply won't
go away.
</P>
<P>
   Well, NBA.com (www.nba.com), the NBA's official site, apparently
isn't about to let a suspension of games affect its production of
fresh online content. Until the lockout is settled, expect a lot of
feature content.
</P>
<P>
   And as boring as it sounds, that might not be a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really have a fairly aggressive development schedule,''
said Stefanie Scheer, director of Internet services for the NBA.
``We'll roll out special features as we have them ready _ whether
or not the lockout continues.''
</P>
<P>
   NBA.com is prepared to satiate the average professional
basketball fan with an enhanced history section, improved
multimedia features and up-to-date coverage of negotiations between
players and owners.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it might not be as exciting as watching Michael
Jordan dunk or witnessing a new Dennis Rodman hairstyle, but it's
going to have to do.
</P>
<P>
   NBA.com was braced for this. Earlier this month, NBA.com
launched the history section in conjunction with NBA Hall of Fame
induction ceremonies. The section includes profiles of inductees, a
history of the game and multimedia features that bring the section
to life.
</P>
<P>
   Julius Erving is scheduled to participate in a live chat at 2:30
p.m. today as part of the history series. Former U.S. Sen. Bill
Bradley, another NBA legend, plugged his book during a chat this
month.
</P>
<P>
   NBA.com also is using the game-less opportunity to work more
closely with its television counterpart, ``Inside Stuff'', to show
footage that doesn't make it on the air.
</P>
<P>
   NBA.com plans to make more use of streaming video _ live video
and audio that can be accessed with the proper plug-ins _ beginning
this week. (''While it isn't new, it's the first time we've used
it,'' Scheer said.)
</P>
<P>
   Coverage of the lockout includes live news conferences and
transcripts of negotiations. Streaming video is also being used on
WNBA.com, the NBA-produced site for the Women's NBA, to market that
league's championship series video.
</P>
<P>
   Once the games begin, more technology will kick in, including
enhancements to the real-time courtside section (where play-by-play
and statistics are produced) and a feature that tracks milestone
achievements. OTHER NBA SITES OF INTEREST
</P>
<P>
   Those who want a more independent and less antiseptic voice for
their NBA fix can try Alleyoop.com (www.alleyoop.com) or On Hoops
(www.onhoops.com).
</P>
<P>
   Alleyoop.com is billed as the ``basketball page for thinking
fans'' and has a collection of editorials written by site author
John Hollinger. On Hoops, created by Arjun Metre and Adam Sussman,
also has a bunch of cutting-edge rants about the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   And for those nights when one starts waxing for a good Allen
Iverson drive, consider the Basketball Penalty Directory
(www.teleport.com/~aeneas/basketball.shtml). This page tracks
suspensions, fines, probations, arrests, convictions, penalties and
violations of NBA players, officials and personalities since 1990.
CHAT HIGHLIGHTS
</P>
<P>
   On the 'Net: Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Kordell Stewart is
the scheduled guest on NFL.com's Quarterback Club at 7 p.m.
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   On America Online: Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Elvis Grbac is

TODAY'S PAPERS: PAGE 1 DIGEST FOR OCT. 20. 
</HEADLINE>
  By SCOTT SHUGER 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Palestine vs. Israel and Department of Justice vs. Microsoft
dominate as they did on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The former leads at the Washington Post, New York Times and Los
Angeles Times, while USA Today goes with the latter. The MS story
is fronted everywhere, except the LAT, which saves it for the
business section.
</P>
<P>
   The Bill Clinton-hosted Mideast peace talks, already not going
well, were sent into an even deeper freeze early Monday by a
grenade attack on Israelis in Beersheba.
</P>
<P>
   The papers report that so intent is Clinton on salvaging the
talks that he canceled a scheduled Monday fund-raising trip to
California to stay personally involved at the rural Maryland site
of the talks. And indeed, in the course of the day, he presided at
a three-way meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu and Yasser Arafat _
their first time in the same room since Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Other heads of state are also trying to keep the sides talking _
the NYT, WP and LAT report that King Hussein of Jordan has flown to
a house he owns in Maryland and was standing by to help, and the
NYT says Hosni Mubarak of Egypt has been in contact with both
sides. But apparently the principals are still flunking chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   The Times quotes an unnamed American official saying that the
two sides do not deal seriously with each other without an American
in the room, and another saying that it pretty much takes Clinton's
presence to get talks going.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli leadership at the conference reacted to the grenade
attack by insisting that it would only discuss security issues with
the Palestinians, a stance the NYT calls a ``dramatic negotiating
ploy,'' probably not the most apt phrase, since there's little
doubt that the Israeli concern about safety from terrorism is
heartfelt. But both the NYT and LAT report that later on Monday,
other issues were actually discussed _ the NYT doesn't say what
though, and the LAT refers only vaguely to the topic of further
redeployments of Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
   All the Microsoft coverage makes it very clear that the
government has decided to make its case very much about Bill Gates.
USAT's lead runs under the headline ``Gates Singled Out in Trial.''
The government started its case, all the papers report, by
contrasting Bill Gates' video deposition (displayed on a
``larger-than-life screen'' says the WP; the NYT says ``10-foot'')
in which he said he knew nothing more about an alleged
market-carving meeting with browser rival Netscape than what he
read in the newspaper (actually he mentioned the Wall Street
Journal, a fact included by everybody _ including the WSJ _ except
USAT), with a Gates email in which he states ``...there is a very
powerful deal of some kind we can do with Netscape...We could even
pay them money as part of the deal, buying some piece of them or
something.''
</P>
<P>
   USAT also notes that in the direct testimony of Netscape CEO
James Barksdale released Monday, Barksdale claims Microsoft used
threats and bribes to get various PC manufacturers and Internet
service providers to go with MS' browser. Some of the papers
feature an AOL exec's email in which he claims, ``Gates delivered a
characteristically blunt query: 'How much do we need to pay you to
screw Netscape? This is your lucky day.''' Wonder if ``screw'' kept
that quote out of USAT.
</P>
<P>
   The Nation's Newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   MS' top lawyer is widely quoted as calling the email evidence
``snippets taken out of context.'' The WP is pretty free with
descriptions of Gates, saying that in his video depo, he was
``slouching'' and was ``visibly testy.'' The Barksdale testimony is
the subject of a separate story inside the Post. Meanwhile, a
pro-Microsoft NYT op-ed by a semiconductor CEO wonders, ``If
Microsoft violated the law by giving away browsers, why didn't
Netscape?''
</P>
<P>
   A front-page LAT story reports that military authorities,
concerned by a recent spate of public Lewinsky-driven criticisms of
President Clinton by military personnel _ in service-oriented
publications and in the WSJ and on the Internet _ are threatening
service members with punishment if they utter ``contemptuous
words'' about their Commander-in-Chief. The paper says the recent
criticisms represent a ``downturn'' in Clinton's standing with the
military.
</P>
<P>
   HBO should never be puzzled again about its target demographic
for Tyson fight broadcasts. According to a NYT story, Iron Mike
himself cleared that up at the hearing Monday where he regained
permission to box in Nevada. ``I represent,'' he testified,
``people, pimps, whores, prostitutes.''

AT MATT SHEPARD'S FUNERAL, THE CLEANSING SNOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the 
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.) 
(gm) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   c. 1998 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune  
CASPER, Wyo. _ Matthew Shepard's beating death became the week's
media event. And Shepard became a national symbol.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A hundred reporters gathered in front of St. Mark's Episcopal
Church Friday in order to tell the nation about the funeral of this
young gay man who had been pistol-whipped and tortured and strung
up like a scarecrow on a buck-and-rail fence.
</P>
<P>
   They came to report on the anti-homosexual religious louts from
Kansas and Texas who picketed outside the church with placards
stating ``God hates fags.'' They came to see if Wyoming is really
only ``guns, chew and brutality.'' The Easterner's stereotype of
the West: Marlboro Man turned psychopath.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard's family and friends came to mourn the death of a young
man whose life was ended so abruptly and brutally. They will miss
the person, his dreams, his smile, his touch, his presence, his
passion for life.
</P>
<P>
   In death, Shepard has become a symbol of the victimized
homosexual _ the reason he was chosen for the deadly assault. His
killers saw only a one-dimensional Shepard, Shepard the queer. The
nation now sees him as the one-dimensional gay victim.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 1,000 others from Wyoming and surrounding states
flew or drove into Casper to mourn for Matt Shepard, the symbol.
They did not know Shepard, the person. They learned from media
reports that he was gay.
</P>
<P>
   Some mourned because they, too, are homosexuals. They mourned
not merely because they understand the fear Shepard must have felt
in his last hours, they mourned for themselves. They know his fate
could be theirs _ living in a society that treats gays and lesbians
as deviants, as pariahs.
</P>
<P>
   Some mourned because of their sense of common humanity. What
befell Shepard befalls all of us _ gay or straight.
</P>
<P>
   Others mourned for the brutal death of a young man _ in a way,
to help ease the guilt some Wyoming people feel about this
travesty.
</P>
<P>
   In three days, the Casper newspaper received nearly 300 letters
and e-mails from all over the world concerning Shepard's death.
</P>
<P>
   Letters from individuals outraged by the way Shepard was killed.
The image of him tied to a fence like a scarecrow and left to die _
imbedded in the psyche like a Jungian archetype.
</P>
<P>
   Letters from gay and lesbian advocacy groups calling for Wyoming
to pass hate crime legislation and join the ``civilized world'' _
as if it would cure America's addiction to violence. Texas has
numerous hate-crime statutes, yet it was in that state recently
where some white thugs tied a black man behind a pick-up and
dragged him until his body disintegrated into pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Hate crime legislation does not stem the violence that arises
out of hate and fear. Not even murder charges stop these vicious
assaults. Hate crime legislation is a symbolic response to the
death of Shepard, the symbol.
</P>
<P>
   Letters lambasting the people of Wyoming. Or filled with the
pain of identifying with Shepard. Or full of sorrow for the human
condition. For our stupidities and prejudices and murderous hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Letters arrived denouncing statements made by anti-homosexual
church groups.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the courage of a fine young Casper reporter
Jason Marsden who, in response to his friend Shepard's death,
writes a column for his newspaper to reveal his own homosexuality.
And calls his grandparents to tell them before they read it or
heard about it. And explains it to his grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   In a climate of brutality, he has made himself a target.
</P>
<P>
   Juxtapose Marsden's courage over the sordid, hateful fax
messages from the members of the Westboro Baptist Church of Topeka,
Kan., who call themselves Christians: ``Fag Matt in Hell,'' ``No
tears for queers,'' ``Fags burn in Hell.'' Some of this
congregation came to Casper to insult Shepard's parents by
picketing with placards across the street from where the funeral
service was held. Purposefully ignoring the deep sorrow his mother
and father suffer and their need for privacy, ignoring common
decency, ignoring the dignity that each person deserves in death,
at least.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn by the media's focus, a few anti-gay church-goers from the
God Said Ministries of Mt. Enterprise, Texas, joined the Topeka
picketers with their own brand of Christian hate.
</P>
<P>
   And snow fell. Wet snow. All day. A veil of silence descended,
surrounding the mourners and the demonstrators. White silence. To
clean the air. To wrap us in privacy. The kind of silence that
cousins sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   And the picketers of hate left for shelter or dry cars or motel
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   A 21-year-old man with all the promise of youth tied to a fence
and left to die, propped up like a scarecrow. And now the snow.

   SUICIDE-ADVANCE _ The first National Conference on Suicide
Prevention meets in Reno, Nevada, this weekend, bringing together
450 activists, researchers, educators and public health
authorities. The meeting, conceived by Atlanta activists Jerry and
Elsie Weyrauch, is an unprecendented attempt to coordinate the
nation's suicide prevention efforts. A third of the people there
will be survivors, so it could be an emotional scene. Story will
summarize the weekend and advance the news conference, scheduled
for Tuesday in Atlanta, in which Surgeon General Satcher and others
discuss their course of action. (Auchmutey, Atlanta

 &HT;    Applewhite is UT's best bet under center
 &HT;    By Kirk Bohls
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Even though the NBA players remain locked out of
their training camps, the first slam dunk of the year comes this
week.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Texas football coach Mack Brown must decide whether
to keep redshirt freshman Major Applewhite or bring back fifth-year
senior Richard Walton as his starting quarterback against Baylor on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Logic, common sense and proper attention to the future, as well
as the last four games, dictate that Applewhite takes the first
snap, as I believe he will. The upside is too great to do anything
else. That should not be construed as a slap at Walton, who it says
here can produce numbers _ and maybe even won-lost records _
similar to those of his previous understudy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it's just a tremendous vote of confidence for a
freckle-faced rookie with uncanny accuracy, great touch on the deep
ball, poise beyond his years and a perpetual deadpan expression on
his boyish face.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Walton has yet to prove he is 100 percent recovered
from the broken finger in his right hand, and he has had lingering
soreness in his wrist and forearm. Walton deserves to be treated
with respect for his loyalty to the program and his abilities and
should be given every chance to wrest the job from Applewhite.
Until he does so in practice or Applewhite falters on game day,
though, Walton will have to contribute as a reserve this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of fans get excited any time there is a quarterback
controversy,'' Brown said playfully. ``It's like a dog around raw
meat. This is good stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he and offensive coordinator Greg Davis will make the
``hard decision'' at some point this week and will base their final
choice on what's best for the team. That should be the sole factor
behind the decision.
</P>
<P>
   I've never been one to agree with coaches who automatically
return the quarterback's job to an injured incumbent once he
recovers. Minnesota's Randall Cunningham has replaced Brad Johnson
and thrown 12 touchdown passes without a single interception, but
Vikings Coach Dennis Green vows to put Johnson under center when
he's healthy. HELLO _ if Johnson were Brett Favre, that idea might
have some merit.
</P>
<P>
   Few will second-guess Chan Gailey for removing Jason Garrett for
a mended Troy Aikman, Garrett's 3-2 record notwithstanding. And if
Walton were, say, a more proven James Brown, then the decision
becomes harder.
</P>
<P>
   Some say Mack Brown should give the job back to Walton _ who
started the first two games _ to properly reward the veteran who
has paid his dues or risk sending a wrong message to other players.
However, doing that would send a wrong signal to the quarterbacks'
teammates. To start anyone other than the best player for the
position is to do a disservice to every player who busts his tail
Monday through Friday to work his way up the depth chart.
</P>
<P>
   Walton is a good quarterback with a 2-2 record in four career
starts and five games of eligibility remaining. Applewhite is a
good quarterback who has led Texas to a 3-1 record and has three
years of eligibility left after this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started our comeback against UCLA with Richard, and he had
a great third quarter,'' Brown said. ``We scored 66 points in the
opener with him. They're not two bad players.''
</P>
<P>
   At his weekly press conference Monday, Brown even took an
informal poll of 16 sportswriters. Fifteen voted to keep Applewhite
as the starter, with one abstention.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite brings big-time instincts, a big-enough arm and a
big-game presence without having grown a big head. Even though he
ranks 17th nationally in pass efficiency after four consecutive
200-yard passing games, he'd give himself ``probably a C'' for a
midseason grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just average,'' he said. ``Not outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, Major. You haven't done one thing remotely average. Since
Applewhite, as a high school junior, first noticed Walton and his
strong arm during warmups for the 1996 Sugar Bowl, he has looked up
to Walton. If ever two people could co-exist at this one
high-profile position, it's Applewhite and Walton. Both are classy,
up-front players who put their team above personal goals and
rewards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not be mad if Richard was the starting quarterback,''
Applewhite said. ``I'd be more than glad to take the second-team
role for this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Barring an unlikely scenario, he won't have to.
</P>

 &HT;    Wallowing in the muck of cliches _ when appropriate, of course
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ In 1951, I spent part of my seventeenth
summer on a dairy farm in upstate New York with my friend Alice and
her grandparents. One morning over freshly picked raspberries and
real cow cream, her 88-year-old grandmother
</P>
<P>
   admonished her 93-year-old mate: ``Clarence, don't speak in
cliches. It ages one.'' Pretty funny, I thought at the time, for
folks of so considerable a vintage to be concerned with such
things.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, I've come to appreciate the wisdom of such
advice. Antiquated thought is evidenced in archaic expression, but
having made that disclaimer, and with apologies to Alice's
grandmother, I'm going to ignore her advice and wallow in a
hackneyed image or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   We've all heard that one, as in: ``Well, if everybody else is
jumping off of the jetty here in Shark Harbor, I might as well join
in.'' Does that translate to yet another old saw: ``Better dead
than different?''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. And I'm sure there are times when conventional wisdom
dictates: ``Don't make waves.'' Like the time my friend Jeanne and
I stumbled into an all-night diner in the Florida Keys looking for
a cup of coffee and found instead a convention of motorcycle mommas
in no mood to deal with a couple of old broads in Birkenstocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatta' you think?'' Jeanne muttered. ``Fight or flight?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Better safe than sorry,'' I allowed. We bugged.
</P>
<P>
   But compliance and avoidance aren't always ``just the ticket.''
``There comes a time'' when we have to ``dig in our heels'' and
``just say no.''
</P>
<P>
   Now is that time.
</P>
<P>
   Hustler huckster Larry Flynt is offering $1 million to anyone
who can hock up proof of an ``adulterous sexual encounter with a
current member of the United States Congress or a high-ranking
government official.''
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, in the past 10 months the American public has been
bombarded with ``sick'' (our President caviling his way around the
truth), ``sicker'' (Linda ``The Wire'' Tripp proclaiming to the
press in a trembling voice: ``I'm just like you. I'm an average
American who found herself in a situation not of her own making,''
and now ``sickest'' (Flynt, a greedy smutmonger looking to cash in
on
</P>
<P>
   our nation's embarrassment).
</P>
<P>
   ``Warts on the backside of humanity,'' my father would have
sneered.
</P>
<P>
   My teen-age peers and I would have put it a little more crudely:
``Urp! Slop! Bring the mop!''
</P>
<P>
   During the '60s and '70s when protesting became
state-of-the-art, I was busy being a wife and later, a mother, so I
never had time to demonstrate against anything except maybe a
feeble in-house rebellion when the diaper service was late. (For my
younger readers, those were the days before diapers came in a box
</P>
<P>
   and ended up in a landfill.) But now I have the time and it's my
turn:
</P>
<P>
   To all of the liars, Larrys, Lindas, and Monicas out there:
``Get a life'' and ``get outta' my face'' because ``I've had it
with you.'' Crawl back under your rocks. I'm not going to buy your
crummy magazine or your sleazy books. I'm boycotting your tasteless
drivel, refusing your rubbish. ``Get the picture?'' I don't like
your kind and I refuse to donate to your retirement fund. This
</P>
<P>
   sickening cycle of crime/punishment/publish/prosper must be
brought to a ``screaming halt'' and the only way I can think of to
do it is by keeping my plastic in my pocket.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure Alice's grandmother would have agreed and maybe even
added a couple of more cliches: ``What the hell? It's worth a
try.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Justice system's flaws are ingrained and obvious
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amnesty International's recent rip on the U.S. criminal justice
system has put American backs up. Don't we provide legal counsel,
civil liberties, open trials, appeals? Wouldn't the world's
criminal-justice average jump way up if no nation did worse at it
than we do?
</P>
<P>
   Yes. But ...
</P>
<P>
   But even so, Amnesty has caught our not inconsiderable
shortfalls and lapses. Many are now built into what passes for the
system, secured there by a crude politics that, claiming to protect
us from crime, in fact wastes money on practices that in their
injustice and inhumanity actually produce more crime _ at the
willful neglect of policies that would be less pricey and more
effective.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what is amiss in the U.S. system came together in the
execution in Virginia last week of Dwayne Allen Wright.
</P>
<P>
   First, we executed. No other industrialized nation still does
that. The death penalty deters no crime, is hugely expensive and
sets a state-sanctioned example that killing is an OK way to solve
problems. It is borne in gross disproportion by the poor,
compounding class angers.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Wright was black, and the residue of racial prejudice
that fouls every level of the criminal justice system piles up on
our death rows in a final grotesque racial disparity and rankling
social irritant.
</P>
<P>
   Third, Wright committed the murder for which he was killed at
17. Few other nations permit executions for juvenile crime _ at
last count, only Yemen, Saudi Arabia, lran and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth, Wright was borderline retarded and was diagnosed at 13
with severe mental illness and brain damage. He never received the
treatment doctors recommended for him in juvenile facilities. (As
governor, Bill Clinton permitted the execution of a man so
profoundly retarded he wanted to save his last-meal dessert for
later.)
</P>
<P>
   And finally, Wright's trial attorney, in a performance common to
indigent cases, failed to mention those mitigations at the
sentencing hearing, leading two jurors to swear later they would
have voted for life imprisonment if they had known.
</P>
<P>
   We are building ever more prisons to house mainly nonviolent
offenders, most sentenced for drug crimes. Alternative sentencing
is both cheaper and less likely to create repeat offenders. And
those who must be incarcerated are now largely denied the jailhouse
education programs that also cut recidivism.
</P>
<P>
   We emphasize imprisonment and cruelty _ and cruelty it is: We
leave all other prisoners pretty much at the mercy of any prison's
worst _ and disdain crime prevention.
</P>
<P>
   We stint on drug treatment. We fail to provide most new, poor
mothers the home visits by parenting counselors that pay off in far
lower eventual crime. We fund few after-school programs _ when most
juvenile crime occurs, not at night as curfews assume. We wink at
police and prison excesses and abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Once the enlightened standard, our justice system now puts us in
the world's backwater with some very sorry company. We'll stay
stuck there until we stop punishing thoughtful counsel and
rewarding, in the name of some ever meaner ``toughness,'' the
political bidding war for more of what we know doesn't work.

 &HT;    Commentary: For governor, two at a chalkboard
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ ``Every governor's race since 1920 has been about
education,'' said Garry Mauro, jacket slung over his chair,
sidewalk-worn shoes resting for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   One may go back those 78 years and find taxes, highways or water
high on the issues list. But since public schools are the state's
chief responsibility, Mauro's statement is safe. This race for
governor will not break the string.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there's more to Mauro's differences with the governor than
that. He asserts that Bush goes too soft on polluters, that he
erred in allowing plans to proceed for a nuclear dump in West
Texas. He points out that the numbers defy Bush's 1994 promise to
end felons' early release _ with 60,000 getting out early since
then. (That's fewer than under his predecessor, Bush's people will
say.)
</P>
<P>
   But education is the subject of most of this campaign discourse.
At a time when candidates can fudge their differences almost to
indistinction, the differences here are downright stark.
</P>
<P>
   The key distinction is on what to do for schools with the
state's projected $8 billion budget surplus. Mauro would raise
teachers' salaries across the board by $6,000 to bring Texas to the
national average for teacher pay.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wants the lion's share of the surplus _ $2 billion _ to go
to school property tax relief, which, presumably, would give school
districts wiggle room to raise money through ad valorem levies. In
addition, Bush supports directing $1 billion back to school
districts to use for teacher pay hikes and to meet other needs such
as smaller class sizes.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro would take Bush's ante on class sizes and raise it
considerably, borrowing $2 billion from the Available School Fund
to loan to schools to build more classrooms to lower class sizes.
</P>
<P>
   After making that money available, he said, he'd hold school
districts' feet to the fire to meet the state-required 1-to-22
teacher-student ratio for kindergarten through Grade 4. Too many
are evading it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Mauro's teacher pay plan say that an across-the-board
raise would skirt accountability issues like rewarding teachers
based on merit or targeting extra pay where teacher shortages are
great, such as math, science and bilingual classes.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro counters that the state awarded teachers an
across-the-board raise in 1985's landmark H.B. 72, which
dramatically changed the landscape of public education.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wants to put the pay-raise ball in school boards' hands.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also warns that increasing pay across the board will
unsettle a delicate equity formula in which property wealthy
districts get less from the state than do property-poor ones.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro calls that a ``specious'' dodge by those who don't want
all teachers to get a raise.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush is bullish on charter schools and authorized an
expansion on the handful of charters first authorized in 1995,
Mauro urges that Texas put on the brakes, at least until it sees
whether those charter schools created make any difference in
achievement. Early results _ some will call them premature _ have
not been glowing for charter schools as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   As for school vouchers, while Bush supports a pilot project for
vouchers, the concept is conspicuously downplayed in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro said he supports choice within school districts, but
vehemently opposes vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro urges that Texas ``seize the initiative'' provided by the
current good economic times to make some dramatic investments in
public schools. ``This time will not last.''
</P>
<P>
   Submitted: two ``pro-education'' candidates with a lot of chalk
on their hands. On Nov. 3: a show of hands by the voters.

 &HT;    Hume part of equation in Ireland's elusive peace
 &HT;    By Paul Reid
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ About 15 years ago, John Hume _ who last
week won the Nobel Peace Prize _ built a little stone cottage on a
spit of land overlooking the River Foyle in Donegal, just a few
miles over the Northern Ireland border. The chances of his being
assassinated were somewhat diminished on this remote and windswept
promontory.
</P>
<P>
   Hume liked to sit in his yard and watch ships ply the Foyle on
their way to and from Derry. He smoked too many cigarettes while he
stared out to sea. I sat with him in his yard a few times. He told
me more than once that this was the last bit of Ireland seen by
emigrants as they sailed to America and Canada. How sad, he would
say, that after almost everybody was driven out of Ireland, those
few who remained took to killing each other.
</P>
<P>
   To get to his cottage, Hume had to pass through British army
checkpoints on the road from Derry. The guards knew him; he was a
member of Parliament, after all, one of the most highly visible men
in Ireland and Britain. Still, every time he reached a checkpoint,
the soldiers asked for an ID.
</P>
<P>
   ``To show us our proper place, I guess,'' he would say of the
British soldiers. ``But they're not the enemy. The enemy is
ignorance.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Hume's enemies were the people who threw firebombs and
bricks through the windows of his Derry home. He was a moderate,
therefore a target.
</P>
<P>
   Those enemies who didn't resort to weapons employed verbal
bombast. Hume's enemies _ virtually everybody on any side of the
Irish question _ used to say he was nothing but a wily politician
interested in just one thing: winning the Nobel Peace Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Hume loved that twisted line of reasoning. The illogic brought a
smile to his face, a rarity, because John Hume and Northern Ireland
didn't have much to smile about.
</P>
<P>
   If a prize is awarded for peace, then a state of peace must
exist, he would say. Any award would be incidental to the real
prize. Peace.
</P>
<P>
   Hume liked to say that to live in Northern Ireland is to live in
a land where up is down, left is right. It's a place where language
_ even music and art _ are weapons. And when the spoken word fails
to sway your opponent, there's always the bomb and the bullet.
</P>
<P>
   It's been that way since Henry II gave chunks of Ireland to his
Norman lackeys in the 12th century.
</P>
<P>
   It's especially been that way since 1968, when British troops
came to Northern Ireland to keep the peace, another inversion of
logic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been so many lows in the last 30 years,'' his wife,
Pat, said Monday. ``We have bulletproof glass on the windows now.
Maybe we can take it down soon. And we don't get up to the cottage
as much as we'd like. John could use the quiet. He's worked hard,
you know, so hard. He earned this award, but it's Ireland's.
Ireland struggled all those 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Hume spent those three decades stalking peace with the same
bulldog determination his enemies spent stalking him.
</P>
<P>
   His political theory was simple, if impractical: ``Ireland's
people must learn to share Ireland, must respect their differences,
must harness their strengths, must stop the killing.''
</P>
<P>
   He knew this prescription was easier said than done, especially
in such Catholic ghettos as the Bogside area of Derry, where he
lived as a child and where the economic pulse is easy to take
because there is none.
</P>
<P>
   Hume sought to make changes by becoming a master of the
political back room, sometimes literally.
</P>
<P>
   After visiting a Derry City Council meeting in 1989, he
adjourned to an anteroom with two councilors. One, a former IRA
member, had served time in prison for blowing up the council
chambers years earlier. The other, a strident Unionist, had once
cheated death when an IRA bomb strapped under his car fell off when
he hit a pothole. In private, over many cigarettes and strong tea,
Hume got them to reach agreement on a jobs resolution. He knew
these men had to tell their constituents what they wanted to hear,
but he believed that fair deals struck in private could _ slowly
and over time _ be sold to the public.
</P>
<P>
   For 30 years, Hume, in his rumpled suits and baggy sweaters,
preached his message of peace. Few listened. He grew old before his
time, face creased, shoulders down, streaks of gray in his
once-black hair. Irish-American politicians preferred to be
photographed with Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams because it played
well to voters back home. But it was common knowledge in Ireland
that Adams was powerless to call off the dogs of war.
</P>
<P>
   Hume and Nobel co-winner David Trimble _ a Protestant and
Unionist _ did what the terrorists on all sides could not: They
brought everybody to the negotiating table. They stopped the
killing. They made progress, a word that had no meaning in Irish
politics for generations.
</P>
<P>
   They sought peace and found it.
</P>
<P>
   Reached in Strasbourg, where he is a member of the European
Parliament, Hume said Monday: ``The award shows unified
international support for the peace process. That's important for
Ireland. With support the process can continue, must continue.''
</P>
<P>
   In the rocky hills near Hume's Donegal cottage, there's a little
restaurant named St. John's. Over dinner at St John's one dreary
night in June 1988, Hume and I tallied the month's mayhem: 12
children injured when the IRA blew up a school bus, six British
soldiers bombed near Belfast, a policeman shot dead in front of his
family, another cop shot seven times in the back while visiting his
widowed mother, seven dead in a bus bombing in Omagh, an old man
and child hit by snipers firing at a British soldier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The killing will go on until we learn to talk with each
other,'' he said. ``First talk, then action, then peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Right about then, the composer Phil Coulter walked into the
restaurant. Coulter wrote The Town I Love So Well, theme song of
the Irish peace movement. The place was nearly empty. Coulter came
right over to Hume, asked about the family, told him to keep up the
effort. Hume told Coulter that his music was a beautiful and a
calming influence on roiling tempers and seething hatreds.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter told Hume: ``You give voice to the meaning of my
music.''
</P>
<P>
   John Hume got his prize. Peace. Who else but a wily politician
could pull that off in Ireland?

 &HT;    When running with the dogs, stick with program
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The dogs of the Dow are living in interesting times.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when both broad and narrow market indices raced
ahead, the 10 ``dog'' stocks were left far behind. You would have
done better buying an index fund than the dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, when the market was in the tank, the dogs won, in a
way. At least they didn't lose nearly as much value as did the
overall market.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, with the market streaking ahead again, the dogs
lagged.
</P>
<P>
   All this raises once again the question of whether a strategy
can be so simple and so appealing _ and still work well? To put it
another way, if it's all that good, why isn't everybody doing it?
And why aren't they all rich?
</P>
<P>
   The dogs of the Dow rationale is indeed an appealing one: You
buy the stocks of big, sturdy, well-known companies when they are
out of favor and thus unnaturally cheap. When your stocks come back
into favor, you sell them for a pleasing profit and invest the
money in the next round of ``dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   The technique also is appealing, partly because it is easy to
understand and partly because it is entirely mechanical. Follow the
formula and you win.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works: You go through the 30 stocks in the Dow
Jones industrial average and pick the 10 that have the highest
dividend yields. You invest an equal number of dollars in the
shares of each of the 10. At the end of one year _ or whatever time
period you select _ you sell any stocks that are no longer in the
top 10 and replace them with the newest dogs. You repeat the cycle
without fail for as long as you want to invest in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   You are assuming that all of the Dow 30 stocks are sound
companies, able to weather just about any storm and thus are
conservative investments. You pick the high-yield stocks among them
on the theory that a lot of people are worried about those
companies' prospects and thus their prices are unnaturally low.
</P>
<P>
   More years than not, the Dow dogs have outperformed the broad
market, as the chart indicates. Mutual funds have sprung up to
appeal to dog investors. Brokerages sell unit investment trusts
that invest only in dog stocks. And discount brokerages have made
it cheaper for do-it-yourself investors to buy and sell the stocks
for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Investors have put an estimated $20 billion into
dogs of the Dow investments.
</P>
<P>
   Does it still work? Skeptics point out that the dogs' most
impressive returns were not just in bad market years but also in
years past, before it became popular. ``It's a very good
strategy,'' said Susan Dziubinski, editor of the Morningstar
FundInvestor magazine. ``But once everybody's in on the secret, the
success of the system tends to break down.''
</P>
<P>
   Enthusiasts counter that the dogs have been tested back to 1929
and have beaten the market 64 percent of the time. ``It will take a
long time before the dogs have had their day,'' said Jim
O'Shaughnessy, founder of a mutual fund that puts one-third of its
assets into the dogs. ``It's not a matter of opinion. It's a matter
of whether it makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   If you want to pursue ``dogs'' investing, here are some things
to keep in mind:
</P>
<P>
   _ Expenses matter. Annual sales will run up transaction costs,
as will the resultant taxes.
</P>
<P>
   If you decide on a mutual fund or unit investment trust, look
carefully at the expense ratios and other fees you will have to
pay. I wouldn't want to pay much more than, say, 1 percent a year
to the manager of a passive investment.
</P>
<P>
   _ Timing is important. Make sure you hold your investments for
at least one year and a day, or you won't qualify for the lowest
capital gains tax rate.
</P>
<P>
   You should think carefully about opening a dogs program at the
first of January. A lot of other investors might be buying or
selling dogs right then, skewing the prices. Eastman Kodak went up
5 percent on the first trading day this year, at least in part
because it joined the dog pack.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Dow dogs is a rigid, long-term strategy. In any given
year, some of the dogs are really stinky, making them hard to buy.
Some will become really successful, making them hard to let go.

 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 BY STEVEN T. GOLDBERG 
 ADAPTED FROM ``BUT WHICH MUTUAL FUNDS?'' by STEVEN T. GOLDBERG  
 Copyright 1998 The Kiplinger Washington Editors, Inc. 
 Published by Kiplinger Books  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The stock market's turmoil over the past several months has been
unnerving to almost everyone. When is the turbulence going to stop?
Is the stock market safe? What are good funds to buy now?
</P>
<P>
   Such questions beset nearly all investors in times like these.
But investing in mutual funds can be the right choice _ even when
the market is heading down.
</P>
<P>
   And if you invest in fundamentally sound funds that have proven
themselves over the long haul, a market decline is really the best
time to invest, because stocks are cheaper.
 &UR; WHY PUT YOUR MONEY IN THE MARKET? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Given today's market turmoil, many people want to know: Which
way is the stock market headed next, and what can we expect in the
future?
</P>
<P>
   Alas, despite their frequent pronouncements, none of Wall
Street's highly paid analysts have more than a hunch about which
way the stock market will go today, tomorrow or six months from
now. In fact, you're probably better off paying no attention to
predictions about which way the market is going, because nobody
knows.
</P>
<P>
   Just one example of the experts' fallibility: In 1979, Business
Week ran a cover story: ``The Death of Equities.'' The story argued
that the stock market was never again going to offer the kind of
gains it had in the past. Three years later, the biggest bull
market in history began.
</P>
<P>
   While you should ignore the predictions, do bear this in mind:
Through recessions, wars and all other matter of calamities,
stocks, on average, have returned an annualized 11 percent since
1926. That compares to 5.4 percent for government bonds, and 3.7
percent for ``safe'' cash investments such as short-term Treasury
bills, bank certificates of deposits and money-market funds.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, inflation has averaged 3.1 percent. After inflation,
stocks have actually been less likely to lose money over five-year
periods than bonds or cash.
</P>
<P>
   Over all five-year periods since 1926, stocks have outperformed
bonds and cash more than three-quarters of the time.
</P>
<P>
   But before you put all your money into stocks, remember:
</P>
<P>
   _ Stocks are far more volatile than bonds, meaning their returns
bounce around more from month to month and year to year. Cash is
the least volatile investment.
</P>
<P>
   _ In their worst year (1931), stocks plunged 43 percent, while
long-term corporate bonds lost only 8.1 percent in their poorest
year (1969), and the worst return on cash was a minuscule loss of
0.02 percent (in 1938).
</P>
<P>
   _ Stocks have fallen by at least 20 percent about once every
five years since 1926. There's nothing unique about this year's
decline. On average, it has taken two years and five months to
break even for an investor who put money into stocks just before a
20 percent or greater drop.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1929 crash (when stocks lost 86 percent of their value
over three years), though, it took until 1944 to break even. And
after the brutal 1973-74 bear market (when stocks fell 48 percent),
it took more than three years to break even _ and 10 years to break
even after inflation.
</P>
<P>
   You get the idea: Stocks are great long-term investments; bonds
and cash make more sense for shorter time periods. Think of stocks
as a roller coaster, bonds as bumper cars and cash as a carousel.
And tune out prognostications about which will do best in the short
run.
 &UR; BEFORE YOU GET STARTED &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you've decided to invest in stock funds, there are a few
things you should do before getting started.
</P>
<P>
   First, make sure you pay off high-interest debt such as credit
cards. Next, amass a cash cushion equal to at least three months of
your after-tax salary in a bank CD or a money-market account. Or,
if you are bolder, take out a home-equity line of credit that you
can tap in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've taken those steps, there are two things you'll need
to determine about yourself: Can you tolerate fear-inspiring market
declines like the recent one without selling your stock funds? And
how long will it be until you'll need your money?
</P>
<P>
   To find out how much risk you can handle, answer the following
two questions:
</P>
<P>
   1. The news media is filled with stories quoting experts who
predict stocks will lose money in the coming decade. Many suggest
investing in real estate. You would:
</P>
<P>
   a. consider selling some stocks funds and buying real estate
</P>
<P>
   b. be concerned, but stick to your long-term goals
</P>
<P>
   c. dismiss the articles as a sign of unwarranted pessimism over
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   2. Which of the following statements best describes you:
</P>
<P>
   a. I often change my mind and have trouble sticking to a plan.
</P>
<P>
   b. I can stay with a strategy as long as it seems to be doing
well.
</P>
<P>
   c. Once I make up my mind to do something, I tend to follow
through with it regardless of the obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   If you answered ``a'' both times, consider yourself a low-risk
investor. If you answered with one ``a'' and one ``b,'' or two
``b's,'' or one ``a'' and one ``c,'' you're a medium-risk investor.
</P>
<P>
   If you answered with at least one ``c'' and no ``a's,'' you're a
high-risk investor _ able to hold on to stocks no matter how rough
the market gets.
 &UR; HOW MUCH OF YOUR MONEY SHOULD YOU INVEST IN STOCKS? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some stockbrokers and financial planners would have you believe
that figuring out how much to invest in stocks and lower-risk
investments is as difficult as calculus. Not so.
</P>
<P>
   Following are two tables: one for investing for retirement and
the second for investing to meet all other goals.
</P>
<P>
   The table for retirement calls for you to invest a larger
portion of your money in stocks. That's because most people can
expect to live to be 85 or 90 years old _ a long time for your
money to grow, even in retirement.
</P>
<P>
   HOW MUCH OF YOUR MONEY TO INVEST IN STOCKS FOR RETIREMENT OR
WHILE IN RETIREMENT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (The column on the left represents the number of years until
retirement or your age in retirement)
 &UR; .........................TOLERANCE FOR RISK &QL; 
 &UR; ........................LOW...............MODERATE.........HIGH &QL; 
 &UR; More than 15 yrs.........100 percent....100 percent....100 percent &QL; 
 &UR; 10 to 15 yrs..............70.............80............100 &QL;

 &UR; Early retirement (age 65-75).35..........45.............60 &QL; 
 &UR; Late retirement (over age 75).30.........40.............50 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HOW MUCH TO INVEST IN STOCKS FOR ALL GOALS EXCEPT RETIREMENT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (The column on the left represents the number of years until
you'll need the money)
 &UR; ....................TOLERANCE FOR RISK &QL; 
 &UR; ....................LOW............MODERATE............HIGH &QL; 
 &UR; More than 15 yrs....80 percent........100 percent.....100 percent &QL; 
 &UR; 10 to 15 yrs........60.................80.............100 &QL; 
 &UR; 6 to 10 yrs.........55.................70..............90 &QL;

 &UR; 2 to 4..............10.................25..............35 &QL; 
 &UR; 0 to 2...............0..................0...............0 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Armed with this knowledge, and details that I'll give you on
which funds to buy in the next article, there's no need for you to
buy a fund with a sales charge, or to pay a stock broker or
financial adviser to help you select funds.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, once you become accustomed to the ups and downs of
the market, you may find you're more able to tolerate them. If so,
take the risk test again and see if you should increase the
percentage of your money you put into stock funds.
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; SIDEBAR: GETTING STARTED &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to know you need to get started investing _ or
that you need to invest in a more methodical way. It's another
thing to actually pull the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   Procrastination is the enemy of investors. You know all the
excuses: Either you don't have enough money, you'd rather spend it
on something else, the market seems too risky just now or you're
already so far behind that starting would be pointless.
</P>
<P>
   You'll feel better about making a move if, instead of plunging
in, you take a tentative step or two. Invest a modest but fixed
amount from your salary in shares of stock funds every month.
</P>
<P>
   Funds often allow a monthly (or quarterly) minimum investment of
as little as $25 or $50, as long as you agree to make regular,
automatic investments via your checking account. Having the fund
company take the money out of your bank account each month is a big
plus.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a 401(k) or 403(b) retirement plan at work, your
employer will similarly invest money straight from your paycheck.
And most companies match at least part of your investment, offering
an instant, substantial return.
</P>
<P>
   Money you don't see is money you won't spend and money you soon
will find you hardly miss. If you have to sit down and write a
check to a mutual fund every month, it's much easier to find
something else you'd rather spend the money on than your future.

<P>
   Despite the stock market's recent nose dive, it's easy to put
together a solid portfolio of mutual funds to meet your investment
needs. What's more, you can do it without knowing much about funds.
</P>
<P>
   Listed below are suggestions for ready-made portfolios (groups
of funds) that work together _ and that are suited to your
individual needs. The reason for owning a portfolio of funds is
that some types of funds will do well when others do poorly.
</P>
<P>
   The previous article helped you determine how much to invest in
stocks and lower-risk investments. The biggest factor in that
decision is how far you are from needing your money. Another
important factor is how much risk you can tolerate.
</P>
<P>
   To judge whether you have a low, moderate or high tolerance for
risk, just think it through for a minute: Are you the type of
person who can handle declines in your stock funds? Or are you
likely to panic and sell during bad times?
</P>
<P>
   If you have some trouble with risk, you're a low- or
moderate-risk investor. Otherwise, you're a high-risk investor.
</P>
<P>
   You'll need the following tables to assemble your portfolio of
funds.
</P>
<P>
   HOW MUCH OF YOUR MONEY TO INVEST IN STOCKS FOR RETIREMENT OR
WHILE IN RETIREMENT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (The column on the left represents the number of years until
retirement or your age in retirement)
 &UR; .........................TOLERANCE FOR RISK &QL; 
 &UR; ........................LOW...............MODERATE.........HIGH &QL; 
 &UR; More than 15 yrs.........100 percent....100 percent....100 percent &QL;

 &UR; Early retirement (age 65-75).35..........45.............60 &QL; 
 &UR; Late retirement (over age 75).30.........40.............50 &QL;

<P>

<P>
   (The column on the left represents the number of years until
you'll need the money)
 &UR; ....................TOLERANCE FOR RISK &QL; 
 &UR; ....................LOW............MODERATE............HIGH &QL; 
 &UR; More than 15 yrs....80 percent........100 percent.....100 percent &QL; 
 &UR; 10 to 15 yrs........60.................80.............100 &QL; 
 &UR; 6 to 10 yrs.........55.................70..............90 &QL; 
 &UR; 4 to 6 yrs..........30.................40..............60 &QL; 
 &UR; 2 to 4..............10.................25..............35 &QL; 
 &UR; 0 to 2...............0..................0...............0 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next step is selecting a portfolio of funds that work in
sync. Owning a diversified mix of stock funds (and usually some
bond funds) minimizes the fluctuations of your overall investments.
</P>
<P>
   Bear in mind that the funds in this article are not necessarily
going to be the top performers in their categories. But they are
proven, solid funds that work well together. That's what any
investor should search for.
 &UR; USING INDEX FUNDS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before looking at portfolios of actively managed funds, here's a
really simple alternative _ one that I have found is easier for
many people to actually implement.
</P>
<P>
   This approach employs index funds, which mirror the entire stock
market (or bond market). Because they do, index funds can give you
exposure to all segments of the markets.
</P>
<P>
   These funds strive to track a market index or average _ rather
than to excel. At first blush, that may sound like a losing
strategy, but it's not.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that most fund managers fail to beat the averages.
Adding to the simplicity of index funds, you don't have to monitor
them once you buy them. That's because virtually anyone can manage
an index fund.
</P>
<P>
   Further adding to their advantage, index funds charge lower
annual expenses of investors than do actively managed funds.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard (800-635-1511) has fine, low-cost index funds. You can
build a great, long-term stock portfolio with just two:
</P>
<P>
   _ Vanguard Index Total Stock Market, which tracks all U.S.
stocks, not just large ones.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vanguard Total International, which gives you the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Following are portfolios using these funds, as well as bond
funds when needed.
</P>
<P>
   FOR RETIREMENT 0 TO 50 YEARS AWAY _ OR ANY OTHER GOALS SIX OR
MORE YEARS AWAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Invest 75 percent of your stock money in Vanguard Index Total
Stock Market and 25 percent in Vanguard Total International.
</P>
<P>
   If the tables say you need to keep some of your money out of
stocks, invest that portion in Vanguard Index Total Bond Market. If
you're in the 28 percent tax bracket or higher and are investing
outside a tax-deferred account, put your bond money in Vanguard
Municipal High Yield.
</P>
<P>
   FOR EARLY RETIREMENT (UP TO AGE 75) OR ANY OTHER GOALS FOUR TO
SIX YEARS IN THE FUTURE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Invest 90 percent of your stock money in Vanguard Index Total
Stock Market and 10 percent in Vanguard Total International.
</P>
<P>
   Invest your bond money in Vanguard Index Total Bond Market. If
you're in the 28 percent tax bracket or higher, though, instead
divide your bond money evenly between Vanguard Municipal High Yield
and Vanguard Municipal Intermediate.
</P>
<P>
   FOR LATE RETIREMENT (AGES 75 AND OVER) OR ANY OTHER GOALS TWO TO
FOUR YEARS AWAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Put all your stock money into Vanguard Index Total Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
   Put half your bond money in Vanguard Bond Index Short Term,
leaving the remainder in Vanguard Index Total Bond Market. If
you're in the 28 percent bracket or higher, instead divide your
bond money between Vanguard Municipal Intermediate and Vanguard
Municipal Limited Term.
</P>
<P>
   FOR GOALS TWO OR FEWER YEARS AWAY (EXCEPT FOR RETIREMENT) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Divide all your money between Vanguard Bond Index Short Term and
Vanguard Money Market Prime. If you're in the 28 percent tax
bracket or higher, substitute Vanguard Municipal Limited Term for
Vanguard Bond Index Short Term.
 &UR; ANOTHER APPROACH &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Instead of using index funds, you can invest in T. Rowe Price
Spectrum Growth (800-638-5660) and T. Rowe Price Spectrum Income.
Both are low-cost ``funds of funds'' _ in other words, they
themselves invest in other T. Rowe Price funds.
</P>
<P>
   Consulting the tables, use Spectrum Growth in place of all stock
funds and Spectrum Income when stock funds are not called for. When
you are two years from needing your money, shift it to T. Rowe
Price Prime Reserves.
</P>
<P>
   That's all there is to it.
 &UR; CHERRY-PICKING FUNDS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's only a little more bother to gather a portfolio of actively
managed funds from more than one fund family. There's more
paperwork and such, but it may be worth the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Like the previous portfolios, each of the these will give you
ownership of U.S. and foreign stocks, stocks of large companies and
stocks of small companies, as well as stocks of fast-growing
companies and stocks of cheap, beaten-down companies. As you get
closer to needing your money, the portfolios provide you with less
aggressive funds.
</P>
<P>
   In most instances, they'll also give you exposure to different
corners of the bond market.
</P>
<P>
   FOR RETIREMENT IN 10 OR MORE YEARS _ OR ANY OTHER GOALS 15 OR
MORE YEARS AWAY:
</P>
<P>
   _ Skyline Small Cap Value Plus (15 percent of your stock money;
800-458-5222).
</P>
<P>
   _ Berger New Generation (10 percent; 800-333-1001).
</P>

</P>
<P>
   _ Artisan International (30 percent; 800-344-1770).
</P>
<P>
   Put any non-stock money into Loomis Sayles Bond, which you'll
have to buy through a discount broker such as Charles Schwab
(800-435-4000). If you're in the 28 percent tax bracket or higher
and investing outside a tax-deferred retirement account, substitute
Vanguard Municipal High Yield (800-635-1511).
</P>
<P>
   FOR RETIREMENT 0 TO 10 YEARS AWAY OR ANY OTHER GOALS 10 TO 15

Vanguard Municipal Intermediate (800-635-1511) depending on your
tax bracket.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   _ Fidelity Real Estate (35 percent; 800-544-8888)
</P>
<P>
   Divide your bond money evenly among Harbor Bond, Loomis Sayles
High Yield (again, you'll have to buy the fund through a discount
broker) and Vanguard Short-Term Corporate (800-635-1511). If you're
in the 28 percent tax bracket or higher, use Loomis Sayles High
Yield, but substitute Vanguard Municipal Intermediate and Vanguard

<P>
   Despite the stock market's recent nose dive, it's easy to put
together a solid portfolio of mutual funds to meet your investment
needs. What's more, you can do it without knowing much about funds.
</P>
<P>
   Listed below are suggestions for ready-made portfolios (groups
of funds) that work together _ and that are suited to your
individual needs. The reason for owning a portfolio of funds is
that some types of funds will do well when others do poorly.
</P>
<P>
   The previous article helped you determine how much to invest in
stocks and lower-risk investments. The biggest factor in that
decision is how far you are from needing your money. Another
important factor is how much risk you can tolerate.
</P>
<P>
   To judge whether you have a low, moderate or high tolerance for
risk, just think it through for a minute: Are you the type of
person who can handle declines in your stock funds? Or are you
likely to panic and sell during bad times?
</P>
<P>
   If you have some trouble with risk, you're a low- or
moderate-risk investor. Otherwise, you're a high-risk investor.
</P>
<P>
   You'll need the following tables to assemble your portfolio of
funds.
</P>
<P>
   HOW MUCH OF YOUR MONEY TO INVEST IN STOCKS FOR RETIREMENT OR
WHILE IN RETIREMENT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (The column on the left represents the number of years until
retirement or your age in retirement)
 &UR; .........................TOLERANCE FOR RISK &QL; 
 &UR; ........................LOW...............MODERATE.........HIGH &QL; 
 &UR; More than 15 yrs.........100 percent....100 percent....100 percent &QL; 
 &UR; 10 to 15 yrs..............70.............80............100 &QL; 
 &UR; 6 to 10 yrs...............60.............70............100 &QL; 
 &UR; 0 to 6 yrs................40.............50.............85 &QL; 
 &UR; Early retirement (age 65-75).35..........45.............60 &QL; 
 &UR; Late retirement (over age 75).30.........40.............50 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HOW MUCH TO INVEST IN STOCKS FOR ALL GOALS EXCEPT RETIREMENT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (The column on the left represents the number of years until
you'll need the money)
 &UR; ....................TOLERANCE FOR RISK &QL; 
 &UR; ....................LOW............MODERATE............HIGH &QL; 
 &UR; More than 15 yrs....80 percent........100 percent.....100 percent &QL; 
 &UR; 10 to 15 yrs........60.................80.............100 &QL; 
 &UR; 6 to 10 yrs.........55.................70..............90 &QL;

 &UR; 2 to 4..............10.................25..............35 &QL; 
 &UR; 0 to 2...............0..................0...............0 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next step is selecting a portfolio of funds that work in
sync. Owning a diversified mix of stock funds (and usually some
bond funds) minimizes the fluctuations of your overall investments.
</P>
<P>
   Bear in mind that the funds in this article are not necessarily
going to be the top performers in their categories. But they are
proven, solid funds that work well together. That's what any
investor should search for.
 &UR; USING INDEX FUNDS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before looking at portfolios of actively managed funds, here's a
really simple alternative _ one that I have found is easier for
many people to actually implement.
</P>
<P>
   This approach employs index funds, which mirror the entire stock
market (or bond market). Because they do, index funds can give you
exposure to all segments of the markets.
</P>
<P>
   These funds strive to track a market index or average _ rather
than to excel. At first blush, that may sound like a losing
strategy, but it's not.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that most fund managers fail to beat the averages.
Adding to the simplicity of index funds, you don't have to monitor
them once you buy them. That's because virtually anyone can manage
an index fund.
</P>
<P>
   Further adding to their advantage, index funds charge lower
annual expenses of investors than do actively managed funds.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard (800-635-1511) has fine, low-cost index funds. You can
build a great, long-term stock portfolio with just two:
</P>
<P>
   _ Vanguard Index Total Stock Market, which tracks all U.S.
stocks, not just large ones.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vanguard Total International, which gives you the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Following are portfolios using these funds, as well as bond
funds when needed.
</P>
<P>
   FOR RETIREMENT 0 TO 50 YEARS AWAY _ OR ANY OTHER GOALS SIX OR
MORE YEARS AWAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Invest 75 percent of your stock money in Vanguard Index Total
Stock Market and 25 percent in Vanguard Total International.
</P>
<P>
   If the tables say you need to keep some of your money out of
stocks, invest that portion in Vanguard Index Total Bond Market. If
you're in the 28 percent tax bracket or higher and are investing
outside a tax-deferred account, put your bond money in Vanguard
Municipal High Yield.
</P>
<P>
   FOR EARLY RETIREMENT (UP TO AGE 75) OR ANY OTHER GOALS FOUR TO
SIX YEARS IN THE FUTURE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Invest 90 percent of your stock money in Vanguard Index Total
Stock Market and 10 percent in Vanguard Total International.
</P>
<P>
   Invest your bond money in Vanguard Index Total Bond Market. If
you're in the 28 percent tax bracket or higher, though, instead
divide your bond money evenly between Vanguard Municipal High Yield
and Vanguard Municipal Intermediate.
</P>
<P>
   FOR LATE RETIREMENT (AGES 75 AND OVER) OR ANY OTHER GOALS TWO TO
FOUR YEARS AWAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Put all your stock money into Vanguard Index Total Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
   Put half your bond money in Vanguard Bond Index Short Term,
leaving the remainder in Vanguard Index Total Bond Market. If
you're in the 28 percent bracket or higher, instead divide your
bond money between Vanguard Municipal Intermediate and Vanguard
Municipal Limited Term.
</P>
<P>
   FOR GOALS TWO OR FEWER YEARS AWAY (EXCEPT FOR RETIREMENT) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Divide all your money between Vanguard Bond Index Short Term and
Vanguard Money Market Prime. If you're in the 28 percent tax
bracket or higher, substitute Vanguard Municipal Limited Term for
Vanguard Bond Index Short Term.
 &UR; ANOTHER APPROACH &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Instead of using index funds, you can invest in T. Rowe Price
Spectrum Growth (800-638-5660) and T. Rowe Price Spectrum Income.
Both are low-cost ``funds of funds'' _ in other words, they
themselves invest in other T. Rowe Price funds.
</P>
<P>
   Consulting the tables, use Spectrum Growth in place of all stock
funds and Spectrum Income when stock funds are not called for. When
you are two years from needing your money, shift it to T. Rowe
Price Prime Reserves.
</P>
<P>
   That's all there is to it.
 &UR; CHERRY-PICKING FUNDS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's only a little more bother to gather a portfolio of actively
managed funds from more than one fund family. There's more
paperwork and such, but it may be worth the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Like the previous portfolios, each of the these will give you
ownership of U.S. and foreign stocks, stocks of large companies and
stocks of small companies, as well as stocks of fast-growing
companies and stocks of cheap, beaten-down companies. As you get
closer to needing your money, the portfolios provide you with less
aggressive funds.
</P>
<P>
   In most instances, they'll also give you exposure to different
corners of the bond market.
</P>
<P>
   FOR RETIREMENT IN 10 OR MORE YEARS _ OR ANY OTHER GOALS 15 OR
MORE YEARS AWAY:
</P>
<P>
   _ Skyline Small Cap Value Plus (15 percent of your stock money;
800-458-5222).
</P>
<P>
   _ Berger New Generation (10 percent; 800-333-1001).
</P>
<P>
   _ Harbor Capital Appreciation (25 percent; 800-422-1050).
</P>
<P>
   _ Selected American Shares (20 percent; 800-243-1575).
</P>
<P>
   _ Artisan International (30 percent; 800-344-1770).
</P>
<P>
   Put any non-stock money into Loomis Sayles Bond, which you'll
have to buy through a discount broker such as Charles Schwab
(800-435-4000). If you're in the 28 percent tax bracket or higher
and investing outside a tax-deferred retirement account, substitute
Vanguard Municipal High Yield (800-635-1511).
</P>
<P>
   FOR RETIREMENT 0 TO 10 YEARS AWAY OR ANY OTHER GOALS 10 TO 15
YEARS AWAY:
</P>
<P>
   _ Berger New Generation (10 percent)
</P>

</P>
<P>
   _ Babson Value (25 percent; 800-422-2766)
</P>

</P>

   Divide your non-stock money between Loomis Sayles Bond and
Harbor Bond (800-422-1050). If you're in the 28 percent bracket or
higher, instead use Vanguard Municipal High Yield and Vanguard
Municipal Intermediate.
</P>
<P>
   FOR EARLY RETIREMENT (UP TO AGE 75) OR ANY OTHER GOALS SIX TO 10
YEARS IN THE FUTURE:
</P>
<P>
   _ T. Rowe Price Equity Income (35 percent; 800-638-5660)

</P>
<P>
   _ T. Rowe Price Small Cap Stock (10 percent; 800-638-5660)
</P>
<P>
   _ Tweedy Browne Global Value (20 percent; 800-432-4789).
</P>
<P>
   Divide your non-stock money between Loomis Sayles Bond and
Harbor Bond. If you're in the 28 percent bracket or higher, instead
use Vanguard Municipal High Yield and Vanguard Municipal
Intermediate.
</P>
<P>
   FOR LATE RETIREMENT (AGES 75 AND OVER) OR ANY OTHER GOALS FOUR

</P>
<P>
   _ T. Rowe Price Equity Income (60 percent)
</P>
<P>
   _ Royce Premier (20 percent; 800-221-4268)
</P>
<P>
   _ CGM Realty Fund (20 percent; 800-345-4048).
</P>
<P>
   Invest one quarter of your bond money in Northeast Investors
Trust (800-225-6704). Put the remainder into Harbor Bond or
Vanguard Municipal Intermediate (800-635-1511) depending on your
tax bracket.
</P>

 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 BY STEVEN T. GOLDBERG 
 ADAPTED FROM ``BUT WHICH MUTUAL FUNDS?'' by STEVEN T. GOLDBERG

 Published by Kiplinger Books  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The stock market's turmoil over the past several months has been
unnerving to almost everyone. When is the turbulence going to stop?
Is the stock market safe? What are good funds to buy now?
</P>
<P>
   Such questions beset nearly all investors in times like these.
But investing in mutual funds can be the right choice _ even when
the market is heading down.
</P>
<P>
   And if you invest in fundamentally sound funds that have proven
themselves over the long haul, a market decline is really the best
time to invest, because stocks are cheaper.
 &UR; WHY PUT YOUR MONEY IN THE MARKET? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Given today's market turmoil, many people want to know: Which
way is the stock market headed next, and what can we expect in the
future?
</P>
<P>
   Alas, despite their frequent pronouncements, none of Wall
Street's highly paid analysts have more than a hunch about which
way the stock market will go today, tomorrow or six months from
now. In fact, you're probably better off paying no attention to
predictions about which way the market is going, because nobody
knows.
</P>
<P>
   Just one example of the experts' fallibility: In 1979, Business
Week ran a cover story: ``The Death of Equities.'' The story argued
that the stock market was never again going to offer the kind of
gains it had in the past. Three years later, the biggest bull
market in history began.
</P>
<P>
   While you should ignore the predictions, do bear this in mind:
Through recessions, wars and all other matter of calamities,
stocks, on average, have returned an annualized 11 percent since
1926. That compares to 5.4 percent for government bonds, and 3.7
percent for ``safe'' cash investments such as short-term Treasury
bills, bank certificates of deposits and money-market funds.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, inflation has averaged 3.1 percent. After inflation,
stocks have actually been less likely to lose money over five-year
periods than bonds or cash.
</P>
<P>
   Over all five-year periods since 1926, stocks have outperformed
bonds and cash more than three-quarters of the time.
</P>
<P>
   But before you put all your money into stocks, remember:
</P>
<P>
   _ Stocks are far more volatile than bonds, meaning their returns
bounce around more from month to month and year to year. Cash is
the least volatile investment.
</P>
<P>
   _ In their worst year (1931), stocks plunged 43 percent, while
long-term corporate bonds lost only 8.1 percent in their poorest
year (1969), and the worst return on cash was a minuscule loss of
0.02 percent (in 1938).
</P>
<P>
   _ Stocks have fallen by at least 20 percent about once every
five years since 1926. There's nothing unique about this year's
decline. On average, it has taken two years and five months to
break even for an investor who put money into stocks just before a
20 percent or greater drop.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1929 crash (when stocks lost 86 percent of their value
over three years), though, it took until 1944 to break even. And
after the brutal 1973-74 bear market (when stocks fell 48 percent),
it took more than three years to break even _ and 10 years to break
even after inflation.
</P>
<P>
   You get the idea: Stocks are great long-term investments; bonds
and cash make more sense for shorter time periods. Think of stocks
as a roller coaster, bonds as bumper cars and cash as a carousel.
And tune out prognostications about which will do best in the short
run.
 &UR; BEFORE YOU GET STARTED &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you've decided to invest in stock funds, there are a few
things you should do before getting started.
</P>
<P>
   First, make sure you pay off high-interest debt such as credit
cards. Next, amass a cash cushion equal to at least three months of
your after-tax salary in a bank CD or a money-market account. Or,
if you are bolder, take out a home-equity line of credit that you
can tap in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've taken those steps, there are two things you'll need
to determine about yourself: Can you tolerate fear-inspiring market
declines like the recent one without selling your stock funds? And
how long will it be until you'll need your money?
</P>
<P>
   To find out how much risk you can handle, answer the following
two questions:
</P>
<P>
   1. The news media is filled with stories quoting experts who
predict stocks will lose money in the coming decade. Many suggest
investing in real estate. You would:
</P>
<P>
   a. consider selling some stocks funds and buying real estate
</P>
<P>
   b. be concerned, but stick to your long-term goals
</P>
<P>
   c. dismiss the articles as a sign of unwarranted pessimism over
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   2. Which of the following statements best describes you:
</P>
<P>
   a. I often change my mind and have trouble sticking to a plan.
</P>
<P>
   b. I can stay with a strategy as long as it seems to be doing
well.
</P>
<P>
   c. Once I make up my mind to do something, I tend to follow
through with it regardless of the obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   If you answered ``a'' both times, consider yourself a low-risk
investor. If you answered with one ``a'' and one ``b,'' or two
``b's,'' or one ``a'' and one ``c,'' you're a medium-risk investor.
</P>
<P>
   If you answered with at least one ``c'' and no ``a's,'' you're a
high-risk investor _ able to hold on to stocks no matter how rough
the market gets.
 &UR; HOW MUCH OF YOUR MONEY SHOULD YOU INVEST IN STOCKS? &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   Some stockbrokers and financial planners would have you believe
that figuring out how much to invest in stocks and lower-risk
investments is as difficult as calculus. Not so.
</P>
<P>
   Following are two tables: one for investing for retirement and
the second for investing to meet all other goals.
</P>
<P>
   The table for retirement calls for you to invest a larger
portion of your money in stocks. That's because most people can
expect to live to be 85 or 90 years old _ a long time for your
money to grow, even in retirement.

   Armed with this knowledge, and details that I'll give you on
which funds to buy in the next article, there's no need for you to
buy a fund with a sales charge, or to pay a stock broker or
financial adviser to help you select funds.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, once you become accustomed to the ups and downs of
the market, you may find you're more able to tolerate them. If so,
take the risk test again and see if you should increase the
percentage of your money you put into stock funds.
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; SIDEBAR: GETTING STARTED &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to know you need to get started investing _ or
that you need to invest in a more methodical way. It's another
thing to actually pull the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   Procrastination is the enemy of investors. You know all the
excuses: Either you don't have enough money, you'd rather spend it
on something else, the market seems too risky just now or you're
already so far behind that starting would be pointless.
</P>
<P>
   You'll feel better about making a move if, instead of plunging
in, you take a tentative step or two. Invest a modest but fixed
amount from your salary in shares of stock funds every month.
</P>
<P>
   Funds often allow a monthly (or quarterly) minimum investment of
as little as $25 or $50, as long as you agree to make regular,
automatic investments via your checking account. Having the fund
company take the money out of your bank account each month is a big
plus.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a 401(k) or 403(b) retirement plan at work, your
employer will similarly invest money straight from your paycheck.
And most companies match at least part of your investment, offering
an instant, substantial return.
</P>
<P>
   Money you don't see is money you won't spend and money you soon
will find you hardly miss. If you have to sit down and write a
check to a mutual fund every month, it's much easier to find
something else you'd rather spend the money on than your future.

MS PATIENTS FIND DRUG TREATMENTS HELP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Aurora Turk was relieved when she found out she
had multiple sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Thank you, God.' I thought I had some lethal
tumor,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For six months, no one had known what was wrong. Turk, 29, had
just married. She was under a lot of pressure at her job as an
executive assistant in Washington, D.C. She was dead tired.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, one day, I woke up and I was getting this
numbness in my leg,'' said Turk, who now lives in suburban Albany
with her husband. ``Then, five days later, this numbness spread to
both legs and I could hardly walk.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a year ago. Today, Turk is facing the uncertainty of
living with multiple sclerosis, a debilitating, chronic and
sometimes disabling disease of the nervous system. Though MS isn't
fatal, some people die of complications. Ask about the challenges
of living with MS, and people will often talk about the
unpredictability of the disease. Unlike many illnesses, there's no
clear prognosis and MS varies in severity and symptoms from person
to person.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the few generalizations you can make:
</P>
<P>
   _ Some 350,000 Americans have multiple sclerosis, with nearly
200 new cases diagnosed every week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Onset occurs most often between the ages of 20 and 40, and
symptoms may include tingling, numbness, slurred speech, blurred
vision and muscle weakness. Fatigue is often a constant struggle.
</P>
<P>
   _ Women are twice as likely as men to get the disease. For
reasons unclear, it's most common among people who live in colder
climates, where it affects 69 of every 100,000 people. In the
South, it's about half that number.
</P>
<P>
   There is no cure and no one is sure what causes the disease.
Researchers believe the body's immune system attacks the myelin, or
fatty tissues, that protect nerve fibers and help conduct
electrical impulses.
</P>
<P>
   When myelin is destroyed or damaged, the ability of the nerves
to conduct electrical impulses is disrupted and people may develop
new or aggravated symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what the trigger is,'' said Dr. Neil Lava, a
neurologist at the Albany Medical Center here. ``Why does someone
have two attacks in one year and another have no attacks in three
years?''
</P>
<P>
   Using drugs such as Avonex, Capoxone and Betaseron diminish the
frequency and severity of those attacks at a price _ a year's
supply can cost more than $2,000 in insurance co-payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's night and day,'' Lava said. ``Prior to five years ago
what did we have to offer patients but moral support, physical
therapy and some medicines?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the beginning. There are going to be bigger
changes down the road,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the latest research is looking at ways of preventing
nerve damage in the first place. Another line of research is
looking at methods of repairing damaged nerves by re-growing
tissue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very complex disease,'' Lava said. ``There's not going
to be one treatment that makes everything go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Hanlon, 60, credits Avonex, one of the newest medicines,
with helping her cope. She's been living with MS for 33 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm better today than I was 20 years ago,'' said Hanlon, of
Averill Park, a community east of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Though grateful for her good health, she still experiences rough
days, when she has trouble walking or is especially fatigued.
</P>
<P>
   Hanlon has learned how to listen to her own body. She swims
twice a week and often naps. ``I expected to be in a wheelchair or
a nursing home at this age,'' she said. ``I never thought I'd be as
well as I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Turk is also optimistic about her future, though she is still
adjusting to the uncertainty of living with MS.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different kind of illness,'' she said. ``People, they
don't know much about it. They look at you and they say, `She's
fine.' I'm not fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``MS is so silent. It's difficult to deal with.''

 c.1998 Foreign Affairs Magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Aside from the six weeks of the Persian Gulf war, Americans have
known peace for longer than the interval between Versailles and
Pearl Harbor. For the first time since the early 1930s, we face no
single powerful enemy.
</P>
<P>
   To most Americans, the success or failure of U.S. foreign policy
no longer seems a matter of life and death. We invest fewer
resources in defense, diplomacy and development. Since nations no
longer need our protection from the Soviet Union, our international
leverage, despite our strength, is not what it was in an earlier
day.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the demands upon us have not lessened. Like a
kaleidoscope, the patterns of world affairs shift with each spin of
the globe. Rising dangers replace receding ones; old problems
reemerge.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and I, as well as other members of our team,
have spoken often about the goals of American foreign policy.
Boiled down, these have not changed in more than 200 years. They
are to ensure the continued security, prosperity and freedom of our
people.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign policy, unlike baseball, has no world championship;
there are no permanent victories and no 70th home runs. In our era,
moreover, neither the adversaries, nor the rules, nor even the
location of the playing field are fully fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if our dynamic world were to stop for a snapshot today,
it would be possible, very generally and imperfectly, to discern
four basic categories of countries: full members of the
international system; those in transition, seeking to participate
more fully; those too weak, poor or mired in conflict to
participate in a meaningful way; and those that reject the very
rules and precepts upon which the system is based.
</P>
<P>
   This division carries with it a corresponding four-part
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   _ First and foremost, we must strengthen the bonds between and
prevent ruptures among the leading nations. Today, these nations
are at peace and increasingly share a community of interests. This
serves America by contributing to stability, fostering vibrant
economic relationships and having partners available to respond to
regional and global problems.
</P>
<P>
   This state of affairs is, however, not inherently
self-sustaining. Russia is wrestling with severe economic and
political challenges. China's course, despite hopeful signs, is
uncertain. And we must work hard to maintain fully productive
partnerships even with our closest friends, for history warns us of
the risk to alliances once the threat that brought them together
has disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Our top priority remains cementing key relationships and
harnessing them to constructive ends _ including collaboration with
Europe in strengthening NATO and building peace in Bosnia;
cooperation with Korea, Japan and China in talks aimed at lasting
peace on the Korean peninsula; and using the Summit of the Americas
to forge a hemispheric consensus supporting democracy and the rule
of law.
</P>
<P>
   _ Second, we must fortify the international system by helping
transitional or otherwise troubled states become full participants.
This is essential to maintain the momentum of democracy's recent
advances and create more anchors of regional stability and growth.
</P>
<P>
   To this end, we are encouraging rivals in areas such as the
Middle East and South Asia to settle their differences peacefully.
We are helping our friends in central Europe and the newly
independent states of the former Soviet Union navigate financial
minefields, fend off criminals, rebut communist backsliders and
position their societies for entry into key regional institutions.
Worldwide, we are urging every nation to move toward democracy and
abide by global norms.
</P>
<P>
   _ Third, we must give a boost to weaker states that are most
willing to help themselves. In this era, there are no geographic
barriers to full participation in the global economy or, more
generally, in world affairs.
</P>
<P>
   But burdens of debt, poverty, unresolved disputes and
ineffective institutions leave many nations at the margins.
Accordingly, we are trying to help Haiti overcome divisions and
build its young democracy.
</P>
<P>
   From the Caucasus to the Congo, we are engaged with regional
leaders and international organizations trying to end destructive
conflicts. And we have urged Congress to enact the Africa Growth
and Opportunity Act, which emphasizes trade as a complement to aid,
rewards reform and heralds a more self-reliant and prosperous
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finally, we must repel threats to the system of laws and
relationships that affect the security of all nations. We have
created monitoring and inspection regimes to prevent the spread of
nuclear weapons and poison gas while imposing penalties on those
who violate global standards.
</P>
<P>
   We are working hard to halt the proliferation of advanced
missile technologies while developing theater and national
missile-defense systems to defend ourselves. In the Balkans and
elsewhere, we are supporting the advocates of moderation and
tolerance against the ruthless exploiters of ethnic hatred.
</P>
<P>
   And we are seeking, through relentless diplomacy and tough law
enforcement, to create a multilayered web of agreements, laws,
inspectors, police and military power to deny weapons and operating
room to terrorists, criminals and aggressors.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, in order to protect our interests, we must take
actions, forge agreements, create institutions and provide an
example that will help bring the world closer together around the
basic principles of democracy, open markets, law and a commitment
to peace.
</P>
<P>
   If we succeed, the American people will benefit from a world
economy that has regained its footing and resumed broad-based
growth. We will find it safer, easier and more rewarding to trade,
travel, invest and study abroad. And our armed forces will be
called upon less often to respond to urgent and deadly threats.
</P>
<P>
   In such a world, more people in more nations will recognize
their stake in abiding by the international rules of the road and
seeing that others follow suit. Nations will be more likely to work
together to respond to new dangers, prevent conflicts and solve
global problems.
</P>
<P>
   A salutary consensus about what is fair and unfair on trade and
what is right and wrong on human rights will grow. Although the
most we can hope for, in our time, is to build a solid foundation
for such a world, that is nevertheless a tall order.

 c.1998 Foreign Affairs Magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Much of our energy at the State Department is spent encouraging
foreign governments to act for what we perceive to be the common
good _ dissuading regional rivals from provocative acts, promoting
economic reform, blocking destabilizing transfers of arms and
technologies, urging the release of political prisoners and
advocating the development of democratic practices and
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   We do this to prevent conflicts, build prosperity and strengthen
the forces of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   But to succeed, we must convince foreign leaders that the common
good is good for them as well and that our own agenda is
aboveboard. Obviously, we do not use the same approach with an
established modern power that we use with a government whose
authority is weak and institutions wobbly.
</P>
<P>
   We consider the domestic pressures that may be affecting a
government along with the proclivities and capacities of its
leaders. And in any relationship, we refer constantly back to our
basic principles and goals.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there has been much debate about whether we are
more likely to influence the actions of ornery foreign governments
by using the carrot of engagement or the stick of sanctions. The
answer, of course, is that it depends.
</P>
<P>
   Neither China nor Burma is democratic, and both take a dim view
of dissent. Yet we are engaged in a strategic dialogue with China
while maintaining far tougher sanctions, including an investment
ban, against Burma.
</P>
<P>
   Some accuse us of having a double standard. In reality, we have
a single standard based on our assessment of the approach most
likely to achieve results that serve U.S. interests and ideals.
</P>
<P>
   In Burma's case, a repressive military regime has rebuffed
repeated appeals for talks with the democratic opposition led by
Nobel Peace Prize-winner Aung San Suu Kyi. Under the junta, Burma
has become, with official connivance, the world's leading source of
heroin and, with official neglect, the epicenter of a regional AIDS
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Many of its increasingly desperate people are fleeing to
neighboring countries. The democrats, who overwhelmingly won
Burma's last free elections, have called for a halt to foreign
investment and many categories of aid. Political change is
essential if Burma is to transform itself into a source of
stability in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions may well work. Having driven the economy into the
ground, the regime desperately needs foreign investment, loans and
aid. By denying these benefits _ and encouraging others to do the
same _ we may eventually persuade Burmese leaders to rethink where
their own best interests lie.
</P>
<P>
   America's stake in China is far deeper and broader than in
Burma. Asian security, nonproliferation and economic health cannot
be won without Chinese cooperation. Our task is to encourage China
to become a full and fully constructive participant in the
international system. Our approach is to engage in a dialogue with
Chinese leaders while encouraging the broad exchange of information
and ideas between American and Chinese citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Burma, China is changing rapidly. The government is
committed to economic reform. On proliferation, China has
progressed from advocating the spread of nuclear weapons to signing
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty and the Chemical Weapons Convention while agreeing to
tighten controls on sensitive exports.
</P>
<P>
   In the political sphere, China has placed a new emphasis on the
rule of law, permitted somewhat more open public discussion of
political reform, released several prominent dissidents and
ratified one international human-rights convention while promising
to sign another this fall.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Burma, many Chinese reformers welcome Western
political and commercial engagement with their government as a spur
to further openness and change. Moreover, the Dalai Lama, among
others, has praised the U.S.-China dialogue as an appropriate way
to express American support for preserving the cultural, linguistic
and ethnic heritage of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   Critics are right to say that this progress is not good enough.
That is why President Clinton spent much of his time during the
Beijing summit working on the hard issues: urging China to do
better on nonproliferation and political prisoners, pushing for
more open markets, stressing that our improved relations cannot
come at Taiwan's expense and making the case for democracy directly
and compellingly to the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
   It would be presumptuous to suggest that our engagement alone
will cause democracy in China to blossom. China's future will be
determined by the Chinese. But our engagement can contribute to an
environment in which the Chinese people have more access to
information, more contact with the democratic world and less
resistance from their government to outside influences and ideas.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to draw definitive conclusions about the success
of our policy toward China or Burma. In both cases, we hope for
progress; in neither do we expect miracles. Toward these countries
and others where we hope for change, we must be patient and
persistent. And we must design our policies not with a cookie
cutter but with the special characteristics of each in mind.
</P>
<P>
   All this argues for flexibility. There has long been tension
between the executive branch and Congress over mandated sanctions,
prohibitions, restrictions, earmarks and other restraints on
foreign policy. Having worked in both branches, I know that this
tension is inevitable and, at times, constructive.
</P>
<P>
   When I meet with foreign officials, referring to pressure from
Congress can help to spur action. What is not helpful is the
growing tendency to view entire relationships through the prism of
a single issue or to enact laws that deprive the executive of the
leverage needed to bargain effectively.
</P>
<P>
   The true challenge of diplomacy does not reside in the beauty of
our goals. Foreign policy is practical, not aesthetic. It requires
persuading others to agree to new policies and actions based on new
understandings. That may entail simple logic, economic incentives,
technical assistance, new commitments, information-sharing,
coercion, the threat of coercion, sanctions, the threat of
sanctions or any combination of the above _ and it may require a
different mix of those elements tomorrow than it does today.
</P>
<P>
   To do his job well, the president must be able to pick and
choose. You would not ask a carpenter to build a house with only a
hammer. We should not expect our chief executive to construct a
successful foreign policy without a full box of tools.

<P>
   Diplomacy requires vision and pragmatism. It also requires
spine, which dictates that we honor our commitments, back our words
with actions, bear essential costs and take necessary risks.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, it requires that leading nations act firmly and
cooperatively to contain and repel threats to international
security and peace and keep new threats from arising.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnia, during the first half of this decade, is an example of
what happens when that responsibility is not met. Bosnia, since
NATO truly began to assert itself in the summer of 1995, is an
example of what happens when it is.
</P>
<P>
   Today, five new tests of international will and American
leadership loom.
</P>
<P>
   _ First, nations must unite in the struggle against terror.
There is no acceptable middle ground.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorists today are more wealthy, mobile, sophisticated and
deadly than ever before. As President Clinton's resolute response
to the African embassy bombings shows, the nation whose finest
planted the flag at Iwo Jima and plunged into hell at Omaha Beach
will not be intimidated by the murderers who have chosen to make
our nation their enemy.
</P>
<P>
   We will maintain our presence wherever we are needed or have
interests to defend. We will strive to protect and defend our
people. We will support those from other nations who are targeted
or victimized. We will use all appropriate judicial, diplomatic,
economic and military means to counter terrorism. We will hunt down
those who attack our citizens. And we will never falter.
</P>
<P>
   _ Second, the U.N. Security Council must deal firmly with Saddam
Hussein's game of threats and defiance. In refusing to cooperate
with U.N. weapons inspectors, Saddam's goal is to divide the
Security Council, isolate the United States and count on
enforcement fatigue to weaken support for the sanctions regime.
Thus far, his plan has backfired.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council has voted unanimously to suspend reviews of
the sanctions. Without sanctions relief, Saddam's dream of
rebuilding his military and regaining regional influence will never
be realized.
</P>
<P>
   Our strategy is to exert steady diplomatic pressure on Baghdad
to comply with Security Council resolutions and cooperate with U.N.
weapons inspectors while maintaining a robust military presence to
deter it from threatening regional security or vital U.S.
interests. If Iraq tries to break out of its strategic box, our
response will be strong and sure. We have not taken any option off
the table. But we will act on our own timetable, not Saddam's.
</P>
<P>
   _ Third, we must be resolute in our dealings with North Korea.
The regime in Pyongyang hardly inspires trust. It has often acted
with reckless disregard for international norms and broken its
word. Its advanced weapons programs, self-imposed isolation and
lack of transparency threaten regional stability. In partnership
with the Republic of Korea, close consultation with Japan and
cooperation with China and others, we have sought to move North
Korea toward a less belligerent and more open approach to the
world.
</P>
<P>
   It serves everyone's interest to resolve ongoing concerns about
the North's troublesome weapons activities and respond to
humanitarian needs. As we vigorously explore this path, no one
should doubt our determination to defend our allies, troops and
vital interests on the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fourth, we must continue to stand firmly behind implementation
of the Dayton Accords. In Bosnia last year, to admonish those who
still harbored separatist dreams, I said that the United States
would not countenance the revision of Dayton or the partition of
Bosnia. When I returned this summer, I said the same thing, but for
a different reason. Virtually all of Bosnia's leaders have now
pledged to support Dayton, and each of those I met _ Croat, Muslim
and Serb _ urged America's continued public commitment to that
goal.
</P>
<P>
   The positive changes in Bosnia were reflected in September's
elections, which were the freest and most competitive ever held in
that nation. Although Serb leader Biljana Plavsic lost, moderates
gained in every part of the country, engendering hope that
multiethnic national institutions will function more effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Our policy remains the same: It is up to Bosnia's people to
choose their leaders, but we will continue to help only those who
are helping to implement Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   Firmness is also needed in Kosovo, where we have been working
with others on three tracks _ diplomatic, humanitarian and military
_ to end the violence, halt Serb repression, address the needs of
displaced persons and encourage a negotiated solution that protects
the rights of the Kosovar people.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finally, the international community must redouble its efforts
to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction. This requires
a convergence of purpose from Washington to Moscow, Paris to
Beijing, and points in between.
</P>
<P>
   Nonproliferation does not just happen. Nations must be quick to
detect and share information about illicit activity. They must
apply real pressure to countries violating nonproliferation
standards or helping others to do so. They must give unreserved
backing to international weapons-inspection regimes. And they must
not sell sensitive arms and technologies to suspect customers. No
contract is so important and no profit so large that it is worth
endangering the world.
</P>
<P>
   These challenges highlight the importance not only of American
will but also of the collective will of the world's leading
nations. In this sense, America often serves as a catalyst and
coalition-builder. We can sound the trumpet, frame the issues and
point the way, but if global standards are to be enforced, many
nations _ not just the United States _ have indispensable roles to
play.
</P>
<P>
   Those international leaders who insist that the world is or
should be multipolar have an obligation to see that their
particular pole stands up to its responsibilities. At the same
time, the United States cannot persuade others to act if we are not
willing to do so ourselves. Effective coalitions are a consequence
of, not an alternative to, U.S. leadership.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Assume that in U.S. foreign policy we have the vision to know
when to act, the pragmatism to know how to act and the spine to
take on hard but necessary tasks. This is still not sufficient. We
also need the resources _ the people, expertise, equipment and
money _ to get the job done. Unfortunately, today our foreign
policy is living hand-to-mouth.
</P>
<P>
   We are the No. 1 debtor to the United Nations and the
multilateral development banks. For the past decade, we have been
cutting foreign-policy positions, closing diplomatic posts and
shutting U.S. Agency for International Development and U.S.
Information Agency missions.
</P>
<P>
   We lack the funds to provide full security for our people
overseas. And under the current budget agreement, we face a further
reduction in buying power of at least 12 percent over the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
   All this has consequences. It reduces our influence as a force
for peace in the world. It detracts from our leadership on global
economic issues at a time when American workers, farmers, business
people and investors have an enormous stake in the health of
economies overseas. It makes it harder for us to exert leverage on
the contributions of others. And it requires that we walk away from
problems that could be solved.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a test the administration can pass on its own. The
executive, Congress and the public must agree that, in striving to
shape world affairs, America must be more than a status quo
country.
</P>
<P>
   For whether the challenge is building a security fence, easing a
financial crisis, or preventing a regional rivalry from erupting
into violence, America cannot lead without resources, and we cannot
be secure unless we lead.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the ultimate test of our foreign policy is how well
our actions measure up to our ideals. The American people are
practical and understand that there are limits to what we can
accomplish. We are not _ most of us _ crusaders. But we are proud
that America is not just another country, and we want our foreign
policy to reflect our status as the globe's leading champion of
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Today, for the first time in history, electoral democracy is the
world's predominant form of government. Yet many democracies are
fragile and their people only partly free. As our own history
reflects, building democracy is hard.
</P>
<P>
   Even the best-intentioned leaders of new democracies face
daunting challenges. Often, the economies they inherit have been
distorted by decades of centralized planning or graft. Habits of
cronyism and privilege must be changed. Ethnic grievances that may
have simmered for generations must be cooled. And serious
environmental and social problems, including upsurges in crime, may
have to be confronted.
</P>
<P>
   It is by now a truism that democracy requires far more than
elections. It requires legal structures that provide justice,
political parties that offer a choice, markets that reward
initiative, police that are professional and a press that is free
to make its own judgments about what is news.
</P>
<P>
   A second truism is that democracy must find its roots
internally. But outsiders can help to nourish those roots _ which,
within the limits of available resources, is precisely what the
United States is doing.
</P>
<P>
   From Asia to Africa to the Andes, U.S. agencies and
nongovernmental organizations are training judges, drafting
commercial law codes, teaching the rules of parliamentary
procedure, supporting efforts to protect children and empower
women, fostering the development of independent media and otherwise
helping friends to assemble the nuts and bolts of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Although the specifics of our approach vary with country and
circumstance, the fundamental goal is the same: to encourage the
development of democratic institutions and practices.
</P>
<P>
   Some call us unrealistic for insisting that democracy can take
hold in less-developed nations or hegemonic for trying to promote
democratic values. We understand well that democracy must emerge
from individuals' desire to participate in the decisions that shape
their lives, but we see this yearning in all countries and among
all peoples.
</P>
<P>
   Surely there is no better way for us to show respect for the
uniqueness and autonomy of others than to support their right to
shape their own destinies and elect their own leaders. This is why,
unlike dictatorship, democracy is never an imposition. It is, by
definition, always a choice.
</P>
<P>
   We should neither yield to the critics nor grow disillusioned by
the sea of troubles that fledgling democracies face. During the
Cold War, after all, we spoke up for freedom where democracy's
cause seemed without hope. It would be unforgivable if America's
commitment to democratic principles were now to wane because there
is no superpower rival to spur us, because we lack patience or
because democracy's imperfections have caused us to forget the far
greater flaws of every other form of governance.
</P>
<P>
   Freedom is America's purpose. Like other profound human
aspirations, it can never fully be achieved. Liberty is not a
possession; it is a pursuit. And it is the star by which American
foreign policy must continue to navigate during the remaining years
of this century and throughout the next.
</P>
<P>
   Through the more than six decades I have been alive, the world
has looked to America for leadership in countering aggression,
promoting prosperity and opposing injustice in all its forms. In
that time, the American people have responded not in accordance
with any single foreign-policy theory but rather in a way that
reflects the steadfast qualities of courage and pride, pragmatism
and principle that comprise the American character.
</P>
<P>
   As we contemplate future uncertainties and cope with present
headaches, we know that these qualities will be tested over and
over again. The need for alertness, for effort, for discipline will
ever be upon us.
</P>
<P>
   The challenges we face, compared to those confronted by previous
generations, are harder to categorize, more diverse and quicker to
change. But the stakes have not changed.
</P>
<P>
   The success or failure of the American people's foreign policy
remains the single greatest factor in shaping our own history and
the future of the world.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Aside from the six weeks of the Persian Gulf war, Americans have
known peace for longer than the interval between Versailles and
Pearl Harbor. For the first time since the early 1930s, we face no
single powerful enemy.
</P>
<P>
   To most Americans, the success or failure of U.S. foreign policy
no longer seems a matter of life and death. We invest fewer
resources in defense, diplomacy and development. Since nations no
longer need our protection from the Soviet Union, our international
leverage, despite our strength, is not what it was in an earlier
day.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the demands upon us have not lessened. Like a
kaleidoscope, the patterns of world affairs shift with each spin of
the globe. Rising dangers replace receding ones; old problems
reemerge.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and I, as well as other members of our team,
have spoken often about the goals of American foreign policy.
Boiled down, these have not changed in more than 200 years. They
are to ensure the continued security, prosperity and freedom of our
people.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign policy, unlike baseball, has no world championship;
there are no permanent victories and no 70th home runs. In our era,
moreover, neither the adversaries, nor the rules, nor even the
location of the playing field are fully fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if our dynamic world were to stop for a snapshot today,
it would be possible, very generally and imperfectly, to discern
four basic categories of countries: full members of the
international system; those in transition, seeking to participate
more fully; those too weak, poor or mired in conflict to
participate in a meaningful way; and those that reject the very
rules and precepts upon which the system is based.
</P>
<P>
   This division carries with it a corresponding four-part
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   _ First and foremost, we must strengthen the bonds between and
prevent ruptures among the leading nations. Today, these nations
are at peace and increasingly share a community of interests. This
serves America by contributing to stability, fostering vibrant
economic relationships and having partners available to respond to
regional and global problems.
</P>
<P>
   This state of affairs is, however, not inherently
self-sustaining. Russia is wrestling with severe economic and
political challenges. China's course, despite hopeful signs, is
uncertain. And we must work hard to maintain fully productive
partnerships even with our closest friends, for history warns us of
the risk to alliances once the threat that brought them together
has disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Our top priority remains cementing key relationships and
harnessing them to constructive ends _ including collaboration with
Europe in strengthening NATO and building peace in Bosnia;
cooperation with Korea, Japan and China in talks aimed at lasting
peace on the Korean peninsula; and using the Summit of the Americas
to forge a hemispheric consensus supporting democracy and the rule
of law.
</P>
<P>
   _ Second, we must fortify the international system by helping
transitional or otherwise troubled states become full participants.
This is essential to maintain the momentum of democracy's recent
advances and create more anchors of regional stability and growth.
</P>
<P>
   To this end, we are encouraging rivals in areas such as the
Middle East and South Asia to settle their differences peacefully.
We are helping our friends in central Europe and the newly
independent states of the former Soviet Union navigate financial
minefields, fend off criminals, rebut communist backsliders and
position their societies for entry into key regional institutions.
Worldwide, we are urging every nation to move toward democracy and
abide by global norms.
</P>
<P>
   _ Third, we must give a boost to weaker states that are most
willing to help themselves. In this era, there are no geographic
barriers to full participation in the global economy or, more
generally, in world affairs.
</P>
<P>
   But burdens of debt, poverty, unresolved disputes and
ineffective institutions leave many nations at the margins.
Accordingly, we are trying to help Haiti overcome divisions and
build its young democracy.
</P>
<P>
   From the Caucasus to the Congo, we are engaged with regional
leaders and international organizations trying to end destructive
conflicts. And we have urged Congress to enact the Africa Growth
and Opportunity Act, which emphasizes trade as a complement to aid,
rewards reform and heralds a more self-reliant and prosperous
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finally, we must repel threats to the system of laws and
relationships that affect the security of all nations. We have
created monitoring and inspection regimes to prevent the spread of
nuclear weapons and poison gas while imposing penalties on those
who violate global standards.
</P>
<P>
   We are working hard to halt the proliferation of advanced
missile technologies while developing theater and national
missile-defense systems to defend ourselves. In the Balkans and
elsewhere, we are supporting the advocates of moderation and
tolerance against the ruthless exploiters of ethnic hatred.
</P>
<P>
   And we are seeking, through relentless diplomacy and tough law
enforcement, to create a multilayered web of agreements, laws,
inspectors, police and military power to deny weapons and operating
room to terrorists, criminals and aggressors.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, in order to protect our interests, we must take
actions, forge agreements, create institutions and provide an
example that will help bring the world closer together around the
basic principles of democracy, open markets, law and a commitment
to peace.
</P>
<P>
   If we succeed, the American people will benefit from a world
economy that has regained its footing and resumed broad-based
growth. We will find it safer, easier and more rewarding to trade,
travel, invest and study abroad. And our armed forces will be
called upon less often to respond to urgent and deadly threats.
</P>
<P>
   In such a world, more people in more nations will recognize
their stake in abiding by the international rules of the road and
seeing that others follow suit. Nations will be more likely to work
together to respond to new dangers, prevent conflicts and solve
global problems.
</P>
<P>
   A salutary consensus about what is fair and unfair on trade and
what is right and wrong on human rights will grow. Although the
most we can hope for, in our time, is to build a solid foundation
for such a world, that is nevertheless a tall order.

 By MADELEINE K. ALBRIGHT  
 c.1998 Foreign Affairs Magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Much of our energy at the State Department is spent encouraging
foreign governments to act for what we perceive to be the common
good _ dissuading regional rivals from provocative acts, promoting
economic reform, blocking destabilizing transfers of arms and
technologies, urging the release of political prisoners and
advocating the development of democratic practices and
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   We do this to prevent conflicts, build prosperity and strengthen
the forces of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   But to succeed, we must convince foreign leaders that the common
good is good for them as well and that our own agenda is
aboveboard. Obviously, we do not use the same approach with an
established modern power that we use with a government whose
authority is weak and institutions wobbly.
</P>
<P>
   We consider the domestic pressures that may be affecting a
government along with the proclivities and capacities of its
leaders. And in any relationship, we refer constantly back to our
basic principles and goals.
</P>
<P>
   For example, there has been much debate about whether we are
more likely to influence the actions of ornery foreign governments
by using the carrot of engagement or the stick of sanctions. The
answer, of course, is that it depends.
</P>
<P>
   Neither China nor Burma is democratic, and both take a dim view
of dissent. Yet we are engaged in a strategic dialogue with China
while maintaining far tougher sanctions, including an investment
ban, against Burma.
</P>
<P>
   Some accuse us of having a double standard. In reality, we have
a single standard based on our assessment of the approach most
likely to achieve results that serve U.S. interests and ideals.
</P>
<P>
   In Burma's case, a repressive military regime has rebuffed
repeated appeals for talks with the democratic opposition led by
Nobel Peace Prize-winner Aung San Suu Kyi. Under the junta, Burma
has become, with official connivance, the world's leading source of
heroin and, with official neglect, the epicenter of a regional AIDS
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Many of its increasingly desperate people are fleeing to
neighboring countries. The democrats, who overwhelmingly won
Burma's last free elections, have called for a halt to foreign
investment and many categories of aid. Political change is
essential if Burma is to transform itself into a source of
stability in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Sanctions may well work. Having driven the economy into the
ground, the regime desperately needs foreign investment, loans and
aid. By denying these benefits _ and encouraging others to do the
same _ we may eventually persuade Burmese leaders to rethink where
their own best interests lie.
</P>
<P>
   America's stake in China is far deeper and broader than in
Burma. Asian security, nonproliferation and economic health cannot
be won without Chinese cooperation. Our task is to encourage China
to become a full and fully constructive participant in the
international system. Our approach is to engage in a dialogue with
Chinese leaders while encouraging the broad exchange of information
and ideas between American and Chinese citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Burma, China is changing rapidly. The government is
committed to economic reform. On proliferation, China has
progressed from advocating the spread of nuclear weapons to signing
the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty and the Chemical Weapons Convention while agreeing to
tighten controls on sensitive exports.
</P>
<P>
   In the political sphere, China has placed a new emphasis on the
rule of law, permitted somewhat more open public discussion of
political reform, released several prominent dissidents and
ratified one international human-rights convention while promising
to sign another this fall.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Burma, many Chinese reformers welcome Western
political and commercial engagement with their government as a spur
to further openness and change. Moreover, the Dalai Lama, among
others, has praised the U.S.-China dialogue as an appropriate way
to express American support for preserving the cultural, linguistic
and ethnic heritage of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   Critics are right to say that this progress is not good enough.
That is why President Clinton spent much of his time during the
Beijing summit working on the hard issues: urging China to do
better on nonproliferation and political prisoners, pushing for
more open markets, stressing that our improved relations cannot
come at Taiwan's expense and making the case for democracy directly
and compellingly to the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
   It would be presumptuous to suggest that our engagement alone
will cause democracy in China to blossom. China's future will be
determined by the Chinese. But our engagement can contribute to an
environment in which the Chinese people have more access to
information, more contact with the democratic world and less
resistance from their government to outside influences and ideas.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to draw definitive conclusions about the success
of our policy toward China or Burma. In both cases, we hope for
progress; in neither do we expect miracles. Toward these countries
and others where we hope for change, we must be patient and
persistent. And we must design our policies not with a cookie
cutter but with the special characteristics of each in mind.
</P>
<P>
   All this argues for flexibility. There has long been tension
between the executive branch and Congress over mandated sanctions,
prohibitions, restrictions, earmarks and other restraints on
foreign policy. Having worked in both branches, I know that this
tension is inevitable and, at times, constructive.
</P>
<P>
   When I meet with foreign officials, referring to pressure from
Congress can help to spur action. What is not helpful is the
growing tendency to view entire relationships through the prism of
a single issue or to enact laws that deprive the executive of the
leverage needed to bargain effectively.
</P>
<P>
   The true challenge of diplomacy does not reside in the beauty of
our goals. Foreign policy is practical, not aesthetic. It requires
persuading others to agree to new policies and actions based on new
understandings. That may entail simple logic, economic incentives,
technical assistance, new commitments, information-sharing,
coercion, the threat of coercion, sanctions, the threat of
sanctions or any combination of the above _ and it may require a
different mix of those elements tomorrow than it does today.
</P>
<P>
   To do his job well, the president must be able to pick and
choose. You would not ask a carpenter to build a house with only a
hammer. We should not expect our chief executive to construct a
successful foreign policy without a full box of tools.

<P>
   Diplomacy requires vision and pragmatism. It also requires
spine, which dictates that we honor our commitments, back our words
with actions, bear essential costs and take necessary risks.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, it requires that leading nations act firmly and
cooperatively to contain and repel threats to international
security and peace and keep new threats from arising.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnia, during the first half of this decade, is an example of
what happens when that responsibility is not met. Bosnia, since
NATO truly began to assert itself in the summer of 1995, is an
example of what happens when it is.
</P>
<P>
   Today, five new tests of international will and American
leadership loom.
</P>
<P>
   _ First, nations must unite in the struggle against terror.
There is no acceptable middle ground.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorists today are more wealthy, mobile, sophisticated and
deadly than ever before. As President Clinton's resolute response
to the African embassy bombings shows, the nation whose finest
planted the flag at Iwo Jima and plunged into hell at Omaha Beach
will not be intimidated by the murderers who have chosen to make
our nation their enemy.
</P>
<P>
   We will maintain our presence wherever we are needed or have
interests to defend. We will strive to protect and defend our
people. We will support those from other nations who are targeted
or victimized. We will use all appropriate judicial, diplomatic,
economic and military means to counter terrorism. We will hunt down
those who attack our citizens. And we will never falter.
</P>
<P>
   _ Second, the U.N. Security Council must deal firmly with Saddam
Hussein's game of threats and defiance. In refusing to cooperate
with U.N. weapons inspectors, Saddam's goal is to divide the
Security Council, isolate the United States and count on
enforcement fatigue to weaken support for the sanctions regime.
Thus far, his plan has backfired.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council has voted unanimously to suspend reviews of
the sanctions. Without sanctions relief, Saddam's dream of
rebuilding his military and regaining regional influence will never
be realized.
</P>
<P>
   Our strategy is to exert steady diplomatic pressure on Baghdad
to comply with Security Council resolutions and cooperate with U.N.
weapons inspectors while maintaining a robust military presence to
deter it from threatening regional security or vital U.S.
interests. If Iraq tries to break out of its strategic box, our
response will be strong and sure. We have not taken any option off
the table. But we will act on our own timetable, not Saddam's.
</P>
<P>
   _ Third, we must be resolute in our dealings with North Korea.
The regime in Pyongyang hardly inspires trust. It has often acted
with reckless disregard for international norms and broken its
word. Its advanced weapons programs, self-imposed isolation and
lack of transparency threaten regional stability. In partnership
with the Republic of Korea, close consultation with Japan and
cooperation with China and others, we have sought to move North
Korea toward a less belligerent and more open approach to the
world.
</P>
<P>
   It serves everyone's interest to resolve ongoing concerns about
the North's troublesome weapons activities and respond to
humanitarian needs. As we vigorously explore this path, no one
should doubt our determination to defend our allies, troops and
vital interests on the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fourth, we must continue to stand firmly behind implementation
of the Dayton Accords. In Bosnia last year, to admonish those who
still harbored separatist dreams, I said that the United States
would not countenance the revision of Dayton or the partition of
Bosnia. When I returned this summer, I said the same thing, but for
a different reason. Virtually all of Bosnia's leaders have now
pledged to support Dayton, and each of those I met _ Croat, Muslim
and Serb _ urged America's continued public commitment to that
goal.
</P>
<P>
   The positive changes in Bosnia were reflected in September's
elections, which were the freest and most competitive ever held in
that nation. Although Serb leader Biljana Plavsic lost, moderates
gained in every part of the country, engendering hope that
multiethnic national institutions will function more effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Our policy remains the same: It is up to Bosnia's people to
choose their leaders, but we will continue to help only those who
are helping to implement Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   Firmness is also needed in Kosovo, where we have been working
with others on three tracks _ diplomatic, humanitarian and military
_ to end the violence, halt Serb repression, address the needs of
displaced persons and encourage a negotiated solution that protects
the rights of the Kosovar people.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finally, the international community must redouble its efforts
to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction. This requires
a convergence of purpose from Washington to Moscow, Paris to
Beijing, and points in between.
</P>
<P>
   Nonproliferation does not just happen. Nations must be quick to
detect and share information about illicit activity. They must
apply real pressure to countries violating nonproliferation
standards or helping others to do so. They must give unreserved
backing to international weapons-inspection regimes. And they must
not sell sensitive arms and technologies to suspect customers. No
contract is so important and no profit so large that it is worth
endangering the world.
</P>
<P>
   These challenges highlight the importance not only of American
will but also of the collective will of the world's leading
nations. In this sense, America often serves as a catalyst and
coalition-builder. We can sound the trumpet, frame the issues and
point the way, but if global standards are to be enforced, many
nations _ not just the United States _ have indispensable roles to
play.
</P>
<P>
   Those international leaders who insist that the world is or
should be multipolar have an obligation to see that their
particular pole stands up to its responsibilities. At the same
time, the United States cannot persuade others to act if we are not
willing to do so ourselves. Effective coalitions are a consequence
of, not an alternative to, U.S. leadership.

<P>
   Assume that in U.S. foreign policy we have the vision to know
when to act, the pragmatism to know how to act and the spine to
take on hard but necessary tasks. This is still not sufficient. We
also need the resources _ the people, expertise, equipment and
money _ to get the job done. Unfortunately, today our foreign
policy is living hand-to-mouth.
</P>
<P>
   We are the No. 1 debtor to the United Nations and the
multilateral development banks. For the past decade, we have been
cutting foreign-policy positions, closing diplomatic posts and
shutting U.S. Agency for International Development and U.S.
Information Agency missions.
</P>
<P>
   We lack the funds to provide full security for our people
overseas. And under the current budget agreement, we face a further
reduction in buying power of at least 12 percent over the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
   All this has consequences. It reduces our influence as a force
for peace in the world. It detracts from our leadership on global
economic issues at a time when American workers, farmers, business
people and investors have an enormous stake in the health of
economies overseas. It makes it harder for us to exert leverage on
the contributions of others. And it requires that we walk away from
problems that could be solved.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a test the administration can pass on its own. The
executive, Congress and the public must agree that, in striving to
shape world affairs, America must be more than a status quo
country.
</P>
<P>
   For whether the challenge is building a security fence, easing a
financial crisis, or preventing a regional rivalry from erupting
into violence, America cannot lead without resources, and we cannot
be secure unless we lead.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the ultimate test of our foreign policy is how well
our actions measure up to our ideals. The American people are
practical and understand that there are limits to what we can
accomplish. We are not _ most of us _ crusaders. But we are proud
that America is not just another country, and we want our foreign
policy to reflect our status as the globe's leading champion of
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Today, for the first time in history, electoral democracy is the
world's predominant form of government. Yet many democracies are
fragile and their people only partly free. As our own history
reflects, building democracy is hard.
</P>
<P>
   Even the best-intentioned leaders of new democracies face
daunting challenges. Often, the economies they inherit have been
distorted by decades of centralized planning or graft. Habits of
cronyism and privilege must be changed. Ethnic grievances that may
have simmered for generations must be cooled. And serious
environmental and social problems, including upsurges in crime, may
have to be confronted.
</P>
<P>
   It is by now a truism that democracy requires far more than
elections. It requires legal structures that provide justice,
political parties that offer a choice, markets that reward
initiative, police that are professional and a press that is free
to make its own judgments about what is news.
</P>
<P>
   A second truism is that democracy must find its roots
internally. But outsiders can help to nourish those roots _ which,
within the limits of available resources, is precisely what the
United States is doing.
</P>
<P>
   From Asia to Africa to the Andes, U.S. agencies and
nongovernmental organizations are training judges, drafting
commercial law codes, teaching the rules of parliamentary
procedure, supporting efforts to protect children and empower
women, fostering the development of independent media and otherwise
helping friends to assemble the nuts and bolts of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Although the specifics of our approach vary with country and
circumstance, the fundamental goal is the same: to encourage the
development of democratic institutions and practices.
</P>
<P>
   Some call us unrealistic for insisting that democracy can take
hold in less-developed nations or hegemonic for trying to promote
democratic values. We understand well that democracy must emerge
from individuals' desire to participate in the decisions that shape
their lives, but we see this yearning in all countries and among
all peoples.
</P>
<P>
   Surely there is no better way for us to show respect for the
uniqueness and autonomy of others than to support their right to
shape their own destinies and elect their own leaders. This is why,
unlike dictatorship, democracy is never an imposition. It is, by
definition, always a choice.
</P>
<P>
   We should neither yield to the critics nor grow disillusioned by
the sea of troubles that fledgling democracies face. During the
Cold War, after all, we spoke up for freedom where democracy's
cause seemed without hope. It would be unforgivable if America's
commitment to democratic principles were now to wane because there
is no superpower rival to spur us, because we lack patience or
because democracy's imperfections have caused us to forget the far
greater flaws of every other form of governance.
</P>
<P>
   Freedom is America's purpose. Like other profound human
aspirations, it can never fully be achieved. Liberty is not a
possession; it is a pursuit. And it is the star by which American
foreign policy must continue to navigate during the remaining years
of this century and throughout the next.
</P>
<P>
   Through the more than six decades I have been alive, the world
has looked to America for leadership in countering aggression,
promoting prosperity and opposing injustice in all its forms. In
that time, the American people have responded not in accordance
with any single foreign-policy theory but rather in a way that
reflects the steadfast qualities of courage and pride, pragmatism
and principle that comprise the American character.
</P>
<P>
   As we contemplate future uncertainties and cope with present
headaches, we know that these qualities will be tested over and
over again. The need for alertness, for effort, for discipline will
ever be upon us.
</P>
<P>
   The challenges we face, compared to those confronted by previous
generations, are harder to categorize, more diverse and quicker to
change. But the stakes have not changed.
</P>
<P>
   The success or failure of the American people's foreign policy
remains the single greatest factor in shaping our own history and
the future of the world.

   &UR; Part I: RULES of the ROAD FOR AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To most Americans, the success or failure of U.S. foreign policy
no longer seems a matter of life and death. We invest fewer
resources in defense, diplomacy and development. But the demands
upon us have not lessened. The patterns of world affairs shift with
each spin of the globe. Rising dangers replace receding ones; old
problems reemerge. (slugged: BC-GOALS-ALBRIGHT-ONE-NYTSF)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Part II: SANCTIONS ARE JUST ONE TOOL &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Neither China nor Burma is democratic, and both take a dim view
of dissent. Yet we are engaged in a strategic dialogue with China
while maintaining far tougher sanctions, including an investment
ban, against Burma. Some accuse us of having a double standard. But
that's not true. (slugged: BC-SANCTIONS-ALBRIGHT-TWO-NYTSF)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Part III: FIVE MAJOR TESTS OF AMERICAN LEADERSHIP &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nations must unite in the struggle against terror. The U.N.
Security Council must deal firmly with Saddam Hussein's game of
threats and defiance. We must be resolute in our dealings with
North Korea. We must stand firmly behind implementation of the
Dayton Accords. The global community must redouble its efforts to
prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction. (slugged:
BC-TERROR-NUKES-ALBRIGHT-THREE-NYTSF)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Part IV: FREEDOM IS AMERICA'S PURPOSE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We are the No. 1 debtor to the United Nations and the
multilateral development banks. We have been cutting foreign-policy
positions, closing diplomatic posts and shutting U.S. Agency for
International Development and U.S. Information Agency missions. We
lack the funds to provide full security for Americans overseas. Yet
we want our foreign policy to reflect our status as the globe's
leading champion of freedom. (slugged:

<P>
   Terrorism is not a new phenomenon. But today's terrorists, be
they international cults like Aum Shinrikyo or individual nihilists
like the Unabomber, act on a greater variety of motives than ever
before.
</P>
<P>
   More ominously, terrorists may gain access to weapons of mass
destruction, including nuclear devices, germ dispensers, poison gas
weapons and even computer viruses.
</P>
<P>
   Also new is the world's dependence on a nearly invisible and
fragile network for distributing energy and information. Long part
of the Hollywood and Tom Clancy repertory of nightmarish scenarios,
catastrophic terrorism has moved from far-fetched horror to a
contingency that could happen next month.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States still takes conventional terrorism
seriously, as demonstrated by the response to the attacks on its
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August, it is not yet prepared
for the new threat of catastrophic terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   American military superiority on the conventional battlefield
pushes its adversaries toward unconventional alternatives. The
United States has already destroyed one facility in Sudan in its
attempt to target chemical weapons. Russia, storehouse of tens of
thousands of weapons and material to make tens of thousands more,
may be descending into turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the combination of new technology and lethal force
has made biological weapons at least as deadly as chemical and
nuclear alternatives. Technology is more accessible, and society is
more vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Elaborate international networks have developed among organized
criminals, drug traffickers, arms dealers and money launderers,
creating an infrastructure for catastrophic terrorism around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The bombings in East Africa killed hundreds. A successful attack
with weapons of mass destruction could certainly take thousands, or
tens of thousands, of lives.
</P>
<P>
   If the device that exploded in 1993 under the World Trade Center
had been nuclear, or had effectively dispersed a deadly pathogen,
the resulting horror and chaos would have exceeded our ability to
describe it.
</P>
<P>
   Such an act of catastrophic terrorism would be a watershed event
in American history. It could involve loss of life and property
unprecedented in peacetime and undermine America's fundamental
sense of security, as did the Soviet atomic bomb test in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Like Pearl Harbor, this event would divide our past and future
into a before and after. The United States might respond with
draconian measures, scaling back civil liberties, allowing wider
surveillance of citizens, detention of suspects and use of deadly
force.
</P>
<P>
   More violence could follow, either further terrorist attacks or
U.S. counterattacks. Belatedly, Americans would judge their leaders
negligent for not addressing terrorism more urgently.
</P>
<P>
   The danger of weapons of mass destruction being used against
America and its allies is greater now than at any time since the
Cuban missile crisis of 1962. It is a national security problem
that deserves the kind of attention the Pentagon devotes to threats
of military nuclear attack or regional aggression.
</P>
<P>
   The first obstacle to imagination is resignation. The prospects
may seem so dreadful that some officials despair of doing anything
useful.
</P>
<P>
   Some are fatalistic, as if contemplating the possibility of a
supernova. Many thinkers reacted the same way at the dawn of the
nuclear age, expecting doom to strike at any hour and disavowing
any further interest in deterrence as a hopeless venture. But as
with nuclear deterrence, the good news is that more can be done.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence role in preventing catastrophic terrorism is
complicated by ``placeless'' culprits, concealed weapons
development and unconventional deployments, all of which are hard
to monitor and preempt. In cyberattacks, for example, the
deployment of weapons can be entirely electronic.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government should therefore have the authority to
monitor any group and its potential state sponsors that might have
the motive and the means to use weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   In order to detect such weapons anywhere in the world, the
United States should utilize remote sensing technology and
cultivate global sources of information. Necessary measures include
clandestine collection of open sources, such as foreign newspapers
and the Internet, as well as a full exchange of information with
key allies.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a year before its attack on the Tokyo subway system the
Aum Shinrikyo group had used the nerve gas Sarin in assaults on
civilians. Although the Japanese media had reported the news, the
U.S. government remained in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Washington not hear what Japanese law-enforcement
agencies knew, but the Japanese agencies themselves were not aware
of what other local organizations in Japan had uncovered. The
parties involved did not share the expertise to prevent another
attack.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, U.S. intelligence lacks a place to perform
comprehensive planning for the collection of information, where the
yields from overhead reconnaissance, electronic surveillance,
clandestine agents, law-enforcement databases and informants, and
reports from foreign governments can be sifted and organized for
maximum effect.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence job is hard but not impossible. The would-be
terrorists have problems as well. If they are supported by a state,
their organizations tend to be either large and leaky or small and
feckless. If they are not backed by a state, the group may be
small, feckless and pathological too.
</P>
<P>
   These realities form the opportunities for intelligence success.
The national security agencies can seize the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic law-enforcement officials, understandably, do not
actively pursue intelligence collection but focus their efforts on
informants or other evidence in investigating suspected criminal
actions. Civil liberties properly discourage them from going out
and looking for criminals before they have evidence of a crime.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, domestic law enforcement has many techniques
for gathering data, including lawful wiretaps and grand-jury
investigations. Much of what these efforts yield, however, is
closed off to the national security community by law or regulation
to safeguard constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
   The United States needs a new institution to gather intelligence
on catastrophic terrorism _ a National Terrorism Intelligence
Center _ that would collect and analyze information so it could
warn of suspected catastrophic terrorist acts ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
   Since this center would have access to domestic law-enforcement
data, it should not be located at the Central Intelligence Agency.
Instead, the National Center should incorporate the highly
successful Director of Central Intelligence Counterterrorism
Center, which has a narrower mandate than this proposal, and be
located in the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
</P>
<P>
   However, the center would be run by an operating committee
chaired by the director of central intelligence and including the
director of the FBI, the deputy secretary of defense, the deputy
attorney general, the deputy secretary of state and the deputy
national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The National Foreign Intelligence Program, which already
provides support for the FBI's National Security Division, would
cover the center's budget, while the National Security Council
would take up unresolved disputes.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the center would come alternately from the FBI
and the CIA, and all intelligence organizations would provide a
specified number of professionals exempt from agency personnel
ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the center would combine the active intelligence
gathering approach of the national security agencies, which are not
legally constrained in their foreign investigations, with the
domestic authority and investigative resources of law enforcement
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   This combination is consistent with public trust and respect for
civil liberties. The center would have no powers of arrest and
prosecution and would maintain a certain distance from the
traditional defense and intelligence agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The center would also be subject to oversight from existing
institutions, like the federal judiciary, the President's Foreign
Intelligence Advisory Board, and the select intelligence committees
of Congress. Such a plan reconciles the practices of foreign
intelligence work with the restrictions that limit the reach of law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Catastrophic terrorism poses an eminent threat to America's
future. But the United States can fight back only if it sets the
right goals.
</P>
<P>
   In 1940 and 1941, the U.S. government pondered what kind of
forces it would need to wage a global war. The answers went so far
beyond the imagination that wry smiles and shaking heads in
Washington offices greeted the planning papers as they made their
rounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War saw a similar pattern of disbelief. The notion of
an intelligence system founded on photographic surveillance from
the upper atmosphere or outer space seemed outrageously far-fetched
in 1954, when the U-2 program was born. The films and cameras alone
seemed an overwhelming hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later the U-2s were flying; six years later
satellites were in place. Similar stories could be told about the
remarkable history of intercontinental missile guidance or the fast
deployment of more than a half-million troops and thousands of
armored vehicles to the Persian Gulf in 1991 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
   America can meet new challenges, but it must first imagine
success. Only then can it organize itself to attain it.

<P>
   No one is under oath when writing their memoirs, but the joint
account by former President George Bush and his national security
adviser, Brent Scowcroft, has better credentials than most.
</P>
<P>
   They not only had privileged access to official documentation,
as well as their own sources, but also were generously helped by
former staffers such as Richard Haass, Condoleezza Rice and Philip
Zelikow.
</P>
<P>
   ``A World Transformed,'' their new book, covers the years from
January 1989 to December 1991, and these were among the most
momentous of the century, including as they did the liberation of
Eastern Europe, the Tiananmen Square massacre, the unification of
Germany, the Persian Gulf war and the disintegration of the Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   Both in background and personality, Bush was well fitted for the
task of navigating the rapids through which the United States and
the world passed during those three stupendous years. Friendship
was the clue to Bush's success, and he had a genius for it. It went
far deeper than the backslapping camaraderie with which some
Americans try to establish relationships with foreigners, which is
usually deeply resented. Clearly, Bush not only liked but
understood people, including those of different cultures. That made
them tend to like him.
</P>
<P>
   He was, admittedly, lucky in the leaders with whom he had to
deal. German Chancellor Helmut Kohl shared Bush's informal tastes
and anyhow knew the importance of keeping the United States on his
side during the delicate process of German reunification. Margaret
Thatcher never concealed her suspicion of Bush's tendency, as she
saw it, ``to go wobbly,'' but her determination to preserve the
``special relationship'' between Britain and the United States kept
her in line.
</P>
<P>
   Francois Mitterrand was another matter altogether: Had Bush not
charmed the French president during an informal weekend in
Kennebunkport, the persistent efforts of the Quai d'Orsay to rock
the boat might have caused a great deal more trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But most important of all was the friendship with Mikhail
Gorbachev. It was not just that Bush, like Thatcher, found it easy
to do business with him. From the very beginning, he admits, ``I
liked him.''
</P>
<P>
   Under other circumstances, Bush would no doubt have kept these
feelings under close control, but in solving the problems that lay
before them, a relationship of close confidence could do nothing
but good. Scowcroft was professionally more cautious.
</P>
<P>
   It took him some time, as it took many other Americans, to
realize that Gorbachev was ``for real.'' He feared that Gorbachev
was launching a dangerously successful charm offensive to disarm
the West, and warned Bush accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   As the year wore on, however, it became clear that Gorbachev's
concessions over arms control and Eastern Europe were not only
sincerely meant but bitterly opposed within his own entourage. The
support of Gorbachev against his internal enemies became a firm
plank of Western policy.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, even Bush was determined that Gorbachev should not
be allowed to shape the future unilaterally with his dramatic
concessions. Bush was initially criticized for his apparent lack of
ideas, and he disarmingly confessed that he was not good at ``the
vision thing.''
</P>
<P>
   During the first six months of his presidency, however, he
badgered his staff to produce ideas that would enable him to
preserve the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   But by the summer of 1989, events in Europe were moving so fast
that ``the vision thing'' became largely irrelevant. All the United
States could do, in Bush's words, was encourage, guide and manage
change. This required seat-of-the-pants planning, not a vision of a
new world order.
</P>
<P>
   The fundamental question was how to keep the Soviet Union on
board _ first while the people of central and Eastern Europe
struggled to free themselves from communism, then while Germany
pursued reunification, and finally to ensure that a united Germany
remained within NATO.
</P>
<P>
   This task involved convincing the Soviet leadership to swallow a
prolonged meal of toads, and only the most assiduous personal
diplomacy could have persuaded even Gorbachev to do so. The
determination to do nothing to humiliate the Soviet Union was
fundamental to Bush's policy, and it is clear that this was based
not only on prudent recollections of what happened in a humiliated
Germany after World War I but on Bush's own gentlemanly
inclinations.
</P>
<P>
   He stifled all manifestations of triumphalism after the fall of
the Berlin Wall. Bush also made it clear to Gorbachev that he
understood Moscow's dilemma when the Baltic states demanded their
independence. He encouraged the states of Eastern Europe not so
much to distance themselves from the Soviet Union as to liberalize
their own political and economic systems.
</P>
<P>
   The achievement of Bush during this delicate period of
transition was not that he did the right things but that he avoided
doing the wrong ones.
</P>
<P>
   The problems presented by the reunification of Germany were more
complex, if less dramatic. Here, whether the Americans liked it or
not, the initiative lay largely with Kohl. Had there been less
confidence between Kohl and Bush, the entire alliance might have
fallen apart.
</P>
<P>
   Doubts about the wisdom of unifying Germany were widespread
among all the allies, not least the United States, but Bush himself
did not share them. As he put it, he was ``comfortable'' with the
prospect and therefore prepared to back Kohl in a policy that was
not entirely welcome even to all the chancellor's fellow citizens
in the Federal Republic.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, toads had to be swallowed not only by the Soviet
Union, but also by close U.S. allies like Britain and France.
Thatcher did not conceal how much she disliked the taste, but
having made her protest, she fell in line. So did Mitterrand, whose
``special relationship'' with Germany was as important to France as
that with the United States was for Britain.
</P>
<P>
   A final problem was how to reshape NATO so as to convince the
Soviets that the West no longer presented a threat, thereby easing
their withdrawal from Eastern Europe. Again, Thatcher protested but
acquiesced, while the French were able to say that, since they did
not belong to the military structure of NATO, it had nothing to do
with them.
</P>
<P>
   Scowcroft reflects that in these negotiations Britain and France
might have been handled more tactfully, but it probably would not
have made much difference to the outcome. Although neither liked
taking a back seat, the reality is that the key players were Kohl,
Gorbachev and Bush. So long as they agreed, nothing else mattered.
</P>
<P>
   The Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany was
signed in Moscow on September 12, 1990. Six weeks earlier, Saddam
Hussein had invaded Kuwait, and the White House was already busy
dealing with that crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential diplomacy was at even more of a premium here. Bush
was careful to touch base, as he put it, not only with President
Husni Mubarak of Egypt, King Hussein of Jordan, King Fahd of Saudi
Arabia and President Turgut Uzal of Turkey, but also with the
rulers of the smaller Arab emirates, and most important of all,
with Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
   It was Gorbachev's promise of cooperation in the Persian Gulf
that led Bush to express premature hopes for a new world order in
which the superpowers would collaborate in preserving world peace.
Although initially cautious about the use of force, Bush was always
sufficiently determined about the need for firm action to require
no lecturing from Thatcher about being ``wobbly.''
</P>
<P>
   When on Aug. 5 he declared, ``This will not stand, this
aggression against Kuwait,'' he meant what he said.
</P>
<P>
   As the weeks rolled on, Bush's domestic critics complained about
a policy that they feared would lead to another Vietnam and
enormous casualties. Even the hard-won U.N. Security Council
resolution of Nov. 29, authorizing its members to ``use all
necessary means'' to restore peace and security, had so little
effect on a deeply divided U.S. public that the Senate vote to
authorize the use of force passed by only three voices.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, many of the allies were wavering, sending emissaries
to Baghdad in a vain attempt to extract concessions that would
redound to their own political advantage. It needed all of Bush's
strength and self-confidence to hold the course and go through with
the conflict that he knew to be necessary and believed _ in the
teeth of much expert military opinion _ would be brief.
</P>
<P>
   The only way of managing this crisis, he saw, was by fighting a
successful war.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, 1989-91 now seems as briefly euphoric as 1944-45.
Bush acknowledges in his memoirs how lucky and privileged he feels
to have been president during those years, but it can equally be
said that the United States, and the rest of the world, were very
lucky to have had him as president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's successor, Bill Clinton, was to have a different order of
priorities and confront even more complex international problems.
Bush was a hard act to follow.

 &HT;    
 By MIKHAIL GORBACHEV  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    On Oct. 7 millions of people demonstrated in the streets of
Russian cities. Their protest was responsible, their behavior
moderate, with no sign of extremism.
 &HT;    The demonstrators' main demand was for the resignation of
President Yeltsin and early elections of both the president and the
State Duma. It was a clear verdict on the political regime and the
kind of ``shock'' reforms that the country has had to endure for
the past seven years.
 &HT;    Russia is at a dangerous threshold. The clock shows five minutes
to midnight.
 &HT;    Yet, observers noted, the government of Yevgeny Primakov was
spared the demonstrators' criticism. Primakov, his first deputy
Yuri Maslyukov and the new Central Bank president Viktor
Gerashchenko had not been eager for jobs in the Russian cabinet. In
fact, they took some time before deciding to come on board. That
they finally agreed to carry this burden in the present dire
circumstances is a credit to them. These people are capable of
giving priority to the national interests rather than the narrow
interest of those who have become fabulously and unjustifiably rich
during the years of pseudo-reforms.
 &HT;    The new government, however, has already come under criticism
from extreme free-marketeers in Russia and in the West. Primakov is
being accused of dragging his feet and of lacking a clear economic
program. There is concern that the team may backtrack from market
economics. Much is being made of their past, such as the fact that
Maslyukov was chairman of Gosplan, the Soviet Union's central
planning agency.
 &HT;    I must disagree with this rush to judgment. I know these men,
their views and their character. During the years of perestroika
they were firmly in favor of reforms.
 &HT;    In spring 1990, Maslyukov was ready to resign from Prime
Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov's government, accusing him of stalling on
much-needed change. Other members of the new cabinet have also
shown on many occasions their commitment to socially responsible
market economics and democracy.
 &HT;    It would certainly be too soon to demand that they produce an
elaborate, detailed program or far-reaching decisions on how to
advance reforms at the very moment they have to focus on how to
stabilize the overall situation and avoid total disaster. This
might require measures, some of which could resemble a return to
command economics. But don't rush to label the new government
``anti-reform.''
 &HT;    The steps that may be needed to take the situation in hand do
not mean that reforms are being abandoned. They are the price that
must be paid for the misguided policies of the recent past. If
chaos became total, any reforms would have to be written off and we
would see a very different government, an economic dictatorship.
 &HT;    During the time needed to put the real economy _ the production
of goods and services _ back on track, we shall need aid and loans.
Even more than aid, we shall need direct investment and cooperation
projects. After what happened here, creditors and investors are
understandably doubtful about dealing with Russia. I feel, however,
that Primakov and Gerashchenko will be able to persuade the world
that they are serious people and responsible partners.
 &HT;    So both the West and our own economic radicals would do well not
to push the new team. Do not scare people with the prospect of a
``return to communism.'' Russia has made an irrevocable choice.
Even the communists, the lunatic fringe excepted, are saying that
the clock cannot be turned back. So let us not panic; let us work
with quiet determination.
 &HT;    I am afraid, though, that the government could be dealt a blow
from an unexpected quarter, and where it is least protected. I am
afraid the president might try to meddle in the government's work.
Even worse, he could reshuffle it before it had a chance to make a
difference. I have reason to believe that Yeltsin's entourage is
already intriguing to make this happen.
 &HT;    The president should be reminded that such things have always
turned out badly, for himself as well as for the country. It would
be best for all of us if the president gave the Primakov government
a carte blanche _ and then called for early elections of president
and parliament.
 &HT;    Concerns about the results of early elections are, I believe,
exaggerated. The Russians will not support extremists or
irresponsible populists. Today, much more than before, there is a
good chance for the emergence of a coalition of moderate, centrist
forces capable of winning a majority in the Duma and fielding a
strong candidate for president. Tomorrow, that chance could
disappear.
 &HT;    Who that candidate would be depends in large part on the
``content'' of the presidency. I believe that the constitution
should be amended in order to allocate more power to the parliament
and the cabinet.
 &HT;    With a more reasonable balance of government powers, the
president would no longer be a monarch in democratic clothing, nor
would he be able to usurp power and paralyze the federal
government, as Yeltsin was able to do.
 &HT;    The president would become a true guardian of the constitution
and of the people's rights and freedoms _ the nation's moral and
political leader. Primakov could turn out to be just the right man
for this role.
 &HT;    The Cabinet of Ministers would then become the main body of the
executive branch of government. And, although the mayor of Moscow,
Yuri Luzhkov, has already declared his readiness to run for
president, I think that he is better suited for the role of prime
minister.
 &HT;    I urge our Western partners to analyze the political realignment
now under way in Russia without prejudging it and with a
willingness to help Russia. Objectively, Russia may now have a
chance to begin recovering, and gradually reemerge as a serious and
dependable international player.

 By MIKHAIL GORBACHEV  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    On Oct. 7 millions of people demonstrated in the streets of
Russian cities. Their protest was responsible, their behavior
moderate, with no sign of extremism.
 &HT;    The demonstrators' main demand was for the resignation of
President Yeltsin and early elections of both the president and the
State Duma. It was a clear verdict on the political regime and the
kind of ``shock'' reforms that the country has had to endure for
the past seven years.
 &HT;    Russia is at a dangerous threshold. The clock shows five minutes
to midnight.
 &HT;    Yet, observers noted, the government of Yevgeny Primakov was
spared the demonstrators' criticism. Primakov, his first deputy
Yuri Maslyukov and the new Central Bank president Viktor
Gerashchenko had not been eager for jobs in the Russian cabinet. In
fact, they took some time before deciding to come on board. That
they finally agreed to carry this burden in the present dire
circumstances is a credit to them. These people are capable of
giving priority to the national interests rather than the narrow
interest of those who have become fabulously and unjustifiably rich
during the years of pseudo-reforms.
 &HT;    The new government, however, has already come under criticism
from extreme free-marketeers in Russia and in the West. Primakov is
being accused of dragging his feet and of lacking a clear economic
program. There is concern that the team may backtrack from market
economics. Much is being made of their past, such as the fact that
Maslyukov was chairman of Gosplan, the Soviet Union's central
planning agency.
 &HT;    I must disagree with this rush to judgment. I know these men,
their views and their character. During the years of perestroika
they were firmly in favor of reforms.
 &HT;    In spring 1990, Maslyukov was ready to resign from Prime
Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov's government, accusing him of stalling on
much-needed change. Other members of the new cabinet have also
shown on many occasions their commitment to socially responsible
market economics and democracy.
 &HT;    It would certainly be too soon to demand that they produce an
elaborate, detailed program or far-reaching decisions on how to
advance reforms at the very moment they have to focus on how to
stabilize the overall situation and avoid total disaster. This
might require measures, some of which could resemble a return to
command economics. But don't rush to label the new government
``anti-reform.''
 &HT;    The steps that may be needed to take the situation in hand do
not mean that reforms are being abandoned. They are the price that
must be paid for the misguided policies of the recent past. If
chaos became total, any reforms would have to be written off and we
would see a very different government, an economic dictatorship.
 &HT;    During the time needed to put the real economy _ the production
of goods and services _ back on track, we shall need aid and loans.
Even more than aid, we shall need direct investment and cooperation
projects. After what happened here, creditors and investors are
understandably doubtful about dealing with Russia. I feel, however,
that Primakov and Gerashchenko will be able to persuade the world
that they are serious people and responsible partners.
 &HT;    So both the West and our own economic radicals would do well not
to push the new team. Do not scare people with the prospect of a
``return to communism.'' Russia has made an irrevocable choice.
Even the communists, the lunatic fringe excepted, are saying that
the clock cannot be turned back. So let us not panic; let us work
with quiet determination.
 &HT;    I am afraid, though, that the government could be dealt a blow
from an unexpected quarter, and where it is least protected. I am
afraid the president might try to meddle in the government's work.
Even worse, he could reshuffle it before it had a chance to make a
difference. I have reason to believe that Yeltsin's entourage is
already intriguing to make this happen.
 &HT;    The president should be reminded that such things have always
turned out badly, for himself as well as for the country. It would
be best for all of us if the president gave the Primakov government
a carte blanche _ and then called for early elections of president
and parliament.
 &HT;    Concerns about the results of early elections are, I believe,
exaggerated. The Russians will not support extremists or
irresponsible populists. Today, much more than before, there is a
good chance for the emergence of a coalition of moderate, centrist
forces capable of winning a majority in the Duma and fielding a
strong candidate for president. Tomorrow, that chance could
disappear.
 &HT;    Who that candidate would be depends in large part on the
``content'' of the presidency. I believe that the constitution
should be amended in order to allocate more power to the parliament
and the cabinet.
 &HT;    With a more reasonable balance of government powers, the
president would no longer be a monarch in democratic clothing, nor
would he be able to usurp power and paralyze the federal
government, as Yeltsin was able to do.
 &HT;    The president would become a true guardian of the constitution
and of the people's rights and freedoms _ the nation's moral and
political leader. Primakov could turn out to be just the right man
for this role.
 &HT;    The Cabinet of Ministers would then become the main body of the
executive branch of government. And, although the mayor of Moscow,
Yuri Luzhkov, has already declared his readiness to run for
president, I think that he is better suited for the role of prime
minister.
 &HT;    I urge our Western partners to analyze the political realignment
now under way in Russia without prejudging it and with a
willingness to help Russia. Objectively, Russia may now have a
chance to begin recovering, and gradually reemerge as a serious and
dependable international player.

U.S. FOREIGN POLICY ON CONGO INSPIRED KINGSOLVER NOVEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Barbara Kingsolver was 7, her family moved from its home in
Kentucky to central Africa, where her parents did public health
work for a year. Her father, a physician, wanted to go where he
could be most useful, and no place needed him more than the Congo,
a country struggling with new independence and old rivalries, a
place on the brink of civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The Kingsolvers stayed there just long enough for Barbara to
miss second grade. She returned to the United States with memories
of life in an African village, an understanding of what it meant to
be a minority, and an interest in the Congo that would draw her
over the years to stories about its ongoing political turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 30 years later, she has written a novel that is rooted in
her time in Africa. ``The Poisonwood Bible'' (Harper Flamingo, $26)
is the story of renegade Baptist missionary Nathan Price, who in
1959 takes his family from its home in Georgia to the Congo, where
he is determined to convert people and save souls. Narrated by
Nathan's wife, Orleanna, and each of their four daughters (they
range in age from 5 to 15), it is Kingsolver's most political
novel, built around the violent struggle for power in the Congo and
the role American interests played in it.
</P>
<P>
   Kingsolver does not apologize for this, although the insistent
social and political messages in her previous books (``Animal
Dreams,'' ``Pigs in Heaven'') drew criticism from some reviewers.
She will continue to write on such subjects, she says, and she
encourages others to do the same. With her advance for ``The
Poisonwood Bible'' she has founded the Bellwether Prize for
Fiction, an award of $25,000 (plus guaranteed publication) given
each year to an emerging writer whose manuscript ``addresses issues
of social justice and the impact of culture and politics on human
relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Kingsolver lives in Tucson, Ariz., with her husband, Stephen
Hopp, and daughters, Camille, 11, and Lily, 2. In a recent
interview, she talked about her politics, her art and her great
commercial success.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: Did it take a lot of energy to write this book?
</P>
<P>
   ANSWER: Energy, plus blood, sweat and tears. It was by far the
hardest thing I've done. But that's OK. I try to do something new
with each book, and (begin itals) have, (end itals) but somehow it
hasn't been as evident to people in the past as it seems to be now.
Everyone has said, ``What in heaven's name got into you?'' This
book is so different.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did you begin?
</P>
<P>
   A: I suppose the grain of sand that started this book was U.S.
foreign policy, something I've been interested in my whole adult
life, ever since I moved to Tucson and began noticing what the U.S.
was doing in my name and with my tax dollars to other countries,
mostly Latin America. I think what the U.S. did in the Congo stands
for so much in terms of cultural, economic, and spiritual
arrogance. I wanted to ask not what happened, but more than that:
What do we make of it now, and how do we move forward?
</P>
<P>
   Q: How did your brief time in the Congo play into it?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm sort of hesitant to mention it. I wage a constant battle
against people's assumptions that everything I write is
autobiographical. My own family, I'm happy to say, was very
different from the one in this book. But since I was 8 I've had a
personal interest in the Congo, so of course I felt the weight of
its tragedy, year after year, just in the small bits of information
that came through to us.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are many of the details of ``The Poisonwood Bible'' from your
time there?
</P>
<P>
   A: I came home with powerful memories. And I kept a journal. The
day we left for the Congo was the day I began keeping a diary in
earnest, so I guess in some ways I can trace my writing life back
to that day. I knew, in the way that you know when you're a kid,
that I was about to embark on an experience that would so change me
that everything would be different from then on. I wanted to record
that, to peg it to the paper somehow, so I started a journal. I
still have those journals. They're woefully inadequate. There are
whole weeks when I wrote nothing more significant than ``I had a
fight with my brother.'' But then there would be a day when I
wrote, ``The witch doctor came today and there was a lion in the
village.'' Nothing as complete as I would have liked, but enough to
help me remember.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You use five narrative voices in this novel. Why?
</P>
<P>
   A: I always begin with theme, and then I construct characters
who can play out that theme. There were many viewpoints on what
happened in the Congo. My task was to identify those points of
view, fine tune them and assign each one to a character with
physical and emotional characteristics that would make her point of
view work. I needed to get people emotionally involved, make them
care. That's the artist's job.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The voices are very different. Orleanna, the mother, is very
mature, capable of deep love and sorrow. Rachael, the oldest
daughter, is almost irritatingly shallow. Did you like both of
these characters?
</P>
<P>
   A: Oh, I loved them! I loved them all. You can't write a
character that you don't believe in. I think Orleanna is the
conscience of the novel, but oddly enough, Rachael's voice was the
easiest to write, even though I'd like to believe that she's the
most different from me. Streams that move that fast don't run very
deep. She's a cultural cliche _ I lifted her voice straight out of
``Life'' magazine from 1959. All I had to do was page through the
ads, and there she was.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you write the novel straight through?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, I don't write a book in a linear way. First I construct
an outline, and then I layer things in. I write layers and layers
of detail so that I can go back and make everything fit together.
In this case, the end of the book was written long before I
finished.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does criticism of your political themes bother you?
</P>
<P>
   A: Any writer in this culture who wants to address issues of
social change and responsibility runs the risk of being called too
political. It's very provincial. In just about all the rest of the
world, social justice and the ways that economics and culture
affect human relations are considered the fundamental domain of
art. Look at who has won the Nobel Prize. Nadine Gordimer.
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. John Steinbeck. Sometime in the 1950s we
suddenly were provided with this artificial split between art and
politics and we've never gotten over it. It doesn't bother me at
all because it's irrelevant and will pass. People will look back on
this someday as a real stupid time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you write what you want to write?
</P>
<P>
   A: I write what I (begin itals) have (end itals) to write. It's
not a choice for me. I'm a cultural and social realist in my art. I
write about the world that I see and understand, and I've never
lived in a world that doesn't have racism and sexism and cultural
imperialism in it. I can't imagine that world. Evidently some
people do live in that world, but I don't.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Didn't you leave the United States right after the Gulf War
because you objected to the patriotic fervor that broke out here
then?
</P>
<P>
   A: That was an important process for me. I got disgusted and
left, but after a while came to realize that to dismiss the problem
by running away is a coward's solution. To love something enough to
change it is a more heroic goal. If the problems are here, the
solutions are here, too. The funny thing is, there were millions of
people who felt the way I did about the Gulf War. We just didn't
get a voice in the media, and so we were manipulated into believing
in our own isolation. If you envision anything other than a
full-throttle grind towards profit, you don't see that vision
reflected anywhere. But it's there. The amazing thing is that I
write what I write, and people read it. These books are successful
beyond my wildest dreams. That makes me joyful, not because I want
to be a famous novelist _ on the contrary, I'd rather be anonymous
_ but because it's proof that I'm not alone, that my vision is
shared by other people.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Talk a little about how you've coped with your success.
</P>
<P>
   A: The gift I want to give the world, and that I have enough
time to really choose and wrap and know that it's what I mean, is
the (begin itals) book. (end itals) The ``me'' part of the package
_ the Barbara Kingsolver who does interviews and goes on Rosie
O'Donnell _ is so incidental. To be accountable to the world as a
personality is a scary prospect. I'm always afraid I'll say the
wrong thing and there it will be, on national TV forever. I have
this terror that I'm going to undo the good I've done in the world
by saying the wrong thing on the Rosie O'Donnell show. I know it
sounds ungracious. But I've witnessed my society's capacity to
embarrass people beyond belief, to pick apart things people say and
herald them as evidence of character flaws.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But what about the people who love your books?
</P>
<P>
   A: The way I see it is that I'm carrying on this enormous
conversation with people all over the world, and most of the time
I'm completely unaware of it. So when I go out into the world on a
book tour, it reminds me of this conversation and I take pride in
it and I see all of those people who are conversing with me. It
completes the circle in a satisfying way, and it's good to bring
that back home and bear it in mind a little when I write the next
book.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What books have you read lately?
</P>
<P>
   A: The best books I've recently read are no surprise to anybody.
Arundhati Roy's ``The God of Small Things'' just knocked me over.
And Charles Frazier's ``Cold Mountain.'' Wonderful books, by people
who show the real world through their characters. It's great when
the writers you love turn out to be good people, isn't it? &QL;

NEW AND NOTABLE BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; WALTZING THE CAT &QL; 
 &UR; Pam Houston (Norton, $23.95)
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been to four years of college and I should know better,
but I love it when he calls me baby.'' That's the defining line in
Houston's first book, ``Cowboys Are My Weakness,'' a collection of
stories about smart, daredevil women who are attracted to
less-than-enlightened, daredevil men. ``Cowboys'' was a funny, edgy
book, and the memory of it might confuse you in the early pages of
this new volume of 11 interconnected stories. They are narrated by
Lucy O'Rourke, whose voice and bad experiences with men are
reminiscent of those of the women in ``Cowboys.'' But does this
voice translate from river-running country to the big city, where
33-year-old Lucy has come to reinvent her life? Not really, so some
of the material seems stale and somber by comparison. But just when
you think Houston is stuck on a gimmick, she proceeds to dazzle
you. It happens first in the title story, in which Lucy deals with
her feelings for her parents, barely mentioning the men she has
loved ``who raised dogs and smelled like foreign places.'' Instead,
she portrays the enduring friction between parents and grown
children, that reckoning for past sins that must be tempered by the
knowledge that there is only so much time for forgiveness. The book
includes action stories _ rough rivers and hang-gliding come into
play _ and they are harrowing and fun to read. But Houston's
triumph is that she has come to know the quieter adventures of the
heart. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; WHY SINATRA MATTERS &QL; 
 &UR; Pete Hamill (Little, Brown, $18)
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy Cannon, Murray Kempton and William B. Williams are
dead,'' Hamill writes. ``So are Jilly Rizzo and Sugar Ray Robinson
and all those others who once seemed so vividly alive that I could
not imagine them leaving the world. Now Sinatra is dead too, and
it's like a thousand people have just left the room.'' This is no
fawning tribute set to the tune of ``My Way.'' Hamill knows that
the true Sinatra was earlier Sinatra, and that our fascination with
him has a lot to do with his influence over an important era in our
lives. Hamill was friendly with Sinatra for a while, and came close
to writing the singer's autobiography. It didn't happen then, but
does here, in an abbreviated way. The result is an after-hours
book, just as Sinatra's songs were after-hours music, smoky
reflections on a man, his voice and their effect on people. Sinatra
himself would have liked it, and as tributes go, it beats ``My
Way.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; AS TIME GOES BY &QL; 
 &UR; Michael Walsh (Warner, $25)
</P>
<P>
   Oh, please. Rick Blaine as a Jewish gangster whose real name is
Yitzik Baline? Everyone loves the classic film ``Casablanca'' _
except Walsh, who has admitted that he didn't think much of the
movie, and the people at Warner Books who asked Walsh to write this
sequel/prequel. The book works backward and forward from the point
at which Ilsa Lund and Victor Laszlo fly off into the fog above
North Africa, leaving Rick on the tarmac. ``Traces of her tears
remained on her cheeks,'' Walsh writes. ``She didn't want to wipe
them away. They were all she had left.'' But wait! Ilsa and Rick
meet again in London, where they behave like bunnies until Ilsa
leaves for Prague to help assassinate an evil Nazi commander. And
there are hints of _ gasp! _ (begin itals) a happy ending. (end
itals) Here's the straight skinny: If it were not tied to the film,
this would be a lame book with a small audience. Instead, Walsh
messes with Rick and Ilsa and stands to make a killing. Buy it if
you will. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; PRETTY GOOD FOR A GIRL &QL; 
 &UR; Leslie Heywood (Free Press, $24)
</P>
<P>
   It's overwritten, but this memoir of an Arizona high-school
track athlete is a fascinating story about obsessive
competitiveness that leads to fanatical weight control and
emotional and physical burnout. It's all the more disturbing
because Heywood was so young, yet focused with such steely
intensity on being the best in an athletic community that
patronized girls. Eventually, her body broke down and she was
forced to alter her goals, but she poses valuable questions here
for parents of competitive daughters. ``Can we revise people's
ideas about girls enough,'' she writes, ``so that my ghost will
give up having to prove herself, and the other girls running in her
place won't have to erase whole worlds inside themselves just so
someone will notice them, just so they can stand out and win?''
Heywood has an MFA in poetry from the University of Arizona. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THE BODY PROJECT &QL; 
 &UR; Joan Jacobs Brumberg (Vintage, $13)
</P>
<P>
   New in paperback is Brumberg's disturbing look at how women's
and girls' attitudes toward their bodies have changed over the past
century, and not for the better. Drawing on diary excerpts and
media images from 1830 to the present, she traces our attitudes
toward breast size, hair, clothing and cosmetics, and looks at the
shift from a focus on character in the Victorian years to our
current obsession with appearance. The corset days, it seems, were
not so bad after all. This is both enlightening and entertaining,
even as it points out an unsettling trend in our way of looking at
ourselves. &QL;

SAN DIEGO CAN'T COMPETE WITH THE BRONX ZOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Tony Gwynn, 38 and feeling like a kid, took the No.
4 subway line from Manhattan to the Bronx last week. Finally, after
eight batting titles and nearly 3,000 hits, he was making his first
trip to Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn dropped off his bags in the San Diego Padres clubhouse and
made a beeline for Monument Park in center field. More than 400
feet from home plate, Gwynn walked among the monuments to Babe
Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Mickey Mantle and Miller Huggins. Behind the
monuments is a wall covered with 16 plaques commemorating assorted
other New York Yankees history makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first player you see is Babe Ruth, and that hit me like a
ton of bricks,'' Gwynn said. ``You think, `This is baseball.'''
</P>
<P>
   Yankee Stadium has been the center of the baseball universe for
so many Octobers. The stadium is 75, and it has been in the middle
of 35 World Series. If they win this series, it would be the 24th
time for the Yankees. The only thing in their way is a San Diego
franchise that has won one World Series game in 30 seasons of
existence.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees aren't the only ones involved in this World Series
who are steeped in tradition. The Padres have a history, too, and
it's one well worth stacking up next to the Yankees for
perspective's sake.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees tradition is Gehrig facing a crippling and fatal
disease, telling packed house that he is ``the luckiest man on the
face of the earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Padres tradition is former owner Ray Kroc, the McDonald's
magnate, grabbing a microphone during a game and telling the fans,
``Ladies and gentlemen, I have never seen such stupid ballplaying
in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankees tradition is acquiring Ruth because Boston Red Sox owner
Harry Frazee was desperate for cash to finance a play, ``No, No,
Nanette.''
</P>
<P>
   Padres history is trading Ozzie Smith for Garry Templeton, who
once explained his refusal to attend an All-Star game this way:
``If I ain't startin', I ain't departin.'''
</P>
<P>
   Yankees tradition is Ruth calling his shot in the 1932 World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   Padres tradition is manager Dick Williams trying to decide
whether to call the bullpen or 911 in the 1984 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees tradition is Robert Merrill belting out the national
anthem in full operatic voice.
</P>
<P>
   Padres tradition is Roseanne grabbing her crotch after singing
the national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees tradition is Mickey Mantle belting 18 home runs in the
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Padres tradition is no starting pitcher lasting longer than five
innings in the five-game 1984 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees tradition is first baseman Don Mattingly becoming
``Donnie Baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Padres tradition is first baseman Steve Garvey attempting to
become the father of the country.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Making tracks across Europe
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BY RAIL ACROSS SPAIN _ Given the choice, I like being on the way
to somewhere better than being somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Right now I'm on the way to Barcelona, having spent a couple of
nights in Madrid and before that, Paris, setting out to travel
Western Europe by rail on a $500 tourist ticket that will take me
most anywhere I want to go, night or day, for a couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The original idea was to see a different city every day and do
my sleeping on night trains between destinations.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good idea. The only problem is that it came to me too
late _ some 35 years too late.
</P>
<P>
   At age 57, I'm way too old for such a vigorous schedule.
Constant motion is something akin to constant pain.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that after an overnight train to Madrid I rested for a
couple of days at a hotel frequented by bullfighters in the trendy
Santa Ana district, not far from the bars and cafes where Hemingway
is remembered.
</P>
<P>
   One waiter, whose home is in Pamplona, made famous for its
running of the bulls in Hemingway's ``The Sun Also Rises,'' related
in his limited English that he has a photograph of his grandfather
with the great Ernesto.
</P>
<P>
   Was his grandfather still alive?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he replied, sadly. Here English words failed him.
``Rat-a-tat-tat!'' he exploded, his pistol finger fanning the air.
</P>
<P>
   There's a story in there somewhere, hunkered down behind the
language barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Now, on a day train to Barcelona, I'm seeing the Spanish
countryside for the first time. As it turns out, I've seen it all
before. Probably you have, too
</P>
<P>
   This is spaghetti western country, the stuff that old Clint
Eastwood movies were made of, a geographical paella of Arizona, New
Mexico and West Texas, good, bad and ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind. I'm more interested in the movie playing itself out
inside the train coach.
</P>
<P>
   A young couple is seated in the row in front of me. She's fair,
he's dark. She's pretty, he's handsome. She's in love, he's in
doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Understand I'm just making this up as we go along. But I have to
wonder.
</P>
<P>
   She can't stop smiling a dreamy smile. That's how much in love
she is. I'm not sure she'd be pretty except that she's in love.
</P>
<P>
   He's too quiet, and not nearly so interested in her as he is in
her video camera. (I say it's her camera. It's just a feeling I
have.) He keeps it pointed out the window. If he's taken any shots
of her I haven't noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier when a club car attendant pushed a snack cart through
the coach, she bought a pack of gum. She paid for it herself. He
never offered.
</P>
<P>
   Something else. He has his feet propped up on the seat across
from them. The conductor has warned him once.
</P>
<P>
   For awhile, he took off his sneakers. That seemed to satisfy the
conductor. Sock feet on the seat is allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the conductor is gone, the shoes are back on, the feet
are back up.
</P>
<P>
   Something about this fellow I don't like. But maybe it's just
me.
</P>
<P>
   I'm the father of daughters. Fathers of daughters can be overly
harsh in their judgment of darkly handsome young men.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well, I have other concerns. In Barcelona, a hotel room will
be all but impossible to come by. There are 1,000 dentists in town,
I'm told, for the world convention of dentists.
</P>
<P>
   Already I'm wishing I were somewhere else, or at least on the
way there.

 &HT;    Are you prepared for the greatest computer glitch in history _
the Year 2000 Bug?
 &HT;    Throughout history, prophets and visionaries have spent their
lives preparing for the end of the world.
 &HT;    But this time it is software programmers who are blazing the
millennial trail. They've have read the future, not in the Book of
Revelation, but in a few million lines of computer code.
 &HT;    By now, the source of their anxiety is well known.
 &HT;    In the 1950s and 1960s, when the computer world was young and
memory was expensive, programmers developed a convention for
marking the passage of time. It's the same system most people use
to date their checks: two digits for the day, two for the month and
two for the year. Dropping the ``19'' from the year was convenient,
and it saved two bytes of precious RAM every time it was used.
 &HT;    Those were days of innocence and optimism. Everyone knew what
would happen if this little shortcut was still in use in AD 2000 _
the two-digit year would roll over like the odometer on an old
Chevy, and the computers would think they'd jumped 100 years into
the past. Programmers knew it, and they warned their managers.
 &HT;    Not to worry, was the usual reply. When the millennium finally
rolls around, all this code will be ancient history.
 &HT;    But the code stuck around. The old software worked fine in the
post-mainframe world, so nobody felt compelled to replace it.
Instead, like Roman architects, they just built on top of it. The
two-digit year became a standard, wired right into the heart of
Cobol _ the Common Business Oriented Language that still serves as
the digital workhorse of commerce and industry. It also crept into
the embedded microchips found in everything from VCRs to nuclear
power plants.
 &HT;    For years the Y2K bug sat quietly, remembered largely as an
amusing textbook example of poor software design.
 &HT;    But as 2000 drew near, the screwup became less amusing. In
November 1996, the ``comp.software.year-2000'' newsgroup was
launched, creating an on-line forum that would soon become ground
zero for the Y2K survivalist movement. But at first, the charter
was clear: Discussions would be limited to Y2K bug fixes,
remediation strategies and reports.
 &HT;    Over the course of the next year, information poured into the
newsgroup, and most of it was bad: The FAA was hopelessly behind
schedule in patching air-traffic-control systems; Edward Yardeni,
chief economist for Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Bank, laid odds that
Y2K upheaval would trigger a recession; Ed Yourdon, a respected
software guru and author of 25 computer books, predicted the
collapse of the U.S. government _ not long after he packed up and
moved to New Mexico.
 &HT;    Optimism became a scarce commodity. Philosophical questions were
raised: Do programmers have a moral duty to remain at their
keyboards until the last moments of 1999, like captains on a
sinking ship?
 &HT;    Debates raged over social Darwinism and the ownership of wheat
in grain elevators. Plans were made to begin converting equities
into gold and buying land in remote parts of California, Arizona
and Oklahoma.
 &HT;    In January 1998, 250 ``hits'' were posted to the Website
``misc.survivalism'' _ up from an average of 30 a month in late
1997. Gradually, a new acronym entered the Internet lexicon:
TEOTWAWKI, pronounced ``tee-OH-tawa-kee.'' The End of the World as
We Know It. The Internet's very own survival movement was born.
 &HT;    Scott Olmsted, a 20-year programming veteran, who lives in San
Diego, has known about the Y2K bug since the 1980s, but he never
gave it much thought until early 1997, when he received a
snail-mail flyer from Gary North, a historian and early leader in
the Y2K preparedness movement. After reading it, Olmsted remembers
feeling a vague sense of dread.
 &HT;    But as a rational guy and student of decision analysis _ the
science of logical decision making in the face of chronic
uncertainty _ he didn't jump to any conclusions. Instead, he went
online to do some research.
 &HT;    As he pored over Web sites and news clippings, Olmsted felt
himself moving through the same psychological stages endured by
people confronted with fatal illness: denial, fading into anger,
leading to a deep depression that culminates in a sense of
acceptance.
 &HT;    ``I'm still not 100 percent sure that the world's coming to an
end,'' he admits. ``But the idea that I may want to get out of town
for a while is not such a long shot. It's enough to make me want to
prepare.''
 &HT;    Olmsted has decided that the only real fix for the Y2K problem
may be to pack up and move to a patch of land 75 miles from his San
Diego home.
 &HT;    ``In the next year or so,'' he predicts, ``the most common
cocktail party chatter will be, 'What are you doing to prepare for
Y2K?' But by then, it will be too late.''
 &HT;    His Y2K retreat is in an area of sagebrush country where high
security means a few strands of barbed wire clinging to a rusty
pole. Olmsted's chain-link fence is shiny and new. The
alarm-company sign that hangs from the fence would be more at home
in Brentwood, and on the roof there's a DirecTV satellite dish
pointed toward the sky. The shed outside his back door will hold
nonperishable food.
 &HT;    Olmsted intends to celebrate New Year's Eve at his home in the
suburbs; the place in the desert will be there just in case things
get rough.
 &HT;    The hardcores believe it will happen like this: On Jan. 1 (or
shortly thereafter), the electricity grid will go dead. Groceries
in America's refrigerators will go bad. Food distribution systems
will crash and store shelves will go bare within days. Businesses
will fail, either because they aren't Y2K compliant or because they
are dependent on noncompliant customers and suppliers.
 &HT;    As losses mount and companies go under, the stock market will
plummet. Banks will calculate interest for negative 100 years. The
government will stop issuing entitlement checks to gray-haired
senior citizens when their age suddenly clicks back to -35. Panic
will set in. Police dispatch systems will be crippled, and the only
law will be the law of the jungle.
 &HT;    Desperate citizens will abandon the cities to hunt for resources
in rural areas. They'll come looking for the mad prophets _ the Y2K
survivalists _ ready to plunder their food, their heat and their
communications links.
 &HT;    Millions of Americans have already gotten a small taste of
critical system failure. When the onboard control system of the
Galaxy IV communications satellite failed on Tues., May 19, 1998,
the outage temporarily crippled U.S. pager networks, several
broadcast news operations and even credit-card verifications
systems.
 &HT;    Most of the disruptions were brief _ technicians were able to
switch to backup communications paths _ but doctors who use pagers
as a lifeline with patients and colleagues were forced to set up
camp in hospitals and offices. The failure of one satellite threw a
wrench into the mechanisms of modern life, perhaps providing a peek
at what life may be like at the dawn of the new millennium.
 &HT;    Or sooner. While the full brunt of the Y2K bug is reserved for
AD 2000, some early problems are already developing. In 1996, Visa
and MasterCard temporarily stopped issuing credit cards with an
expiration date of 2000 after credit-card verification terminals
began choking on the ``00.'' The gaffe led to customer complaints
and a lawsuit filed by a suburban Detroit grocery store against its
computer supplier, TEC America Inc.
 &HT;    Since then, most verification systems have been upgraded, but
Y2K is making its presence known in other areas. The Information
Technology Association of America released a survey last March
showing 44 percent of the U.S. companies they polled have already
experienced Y2K failures. Ninety-four percent of the respondents
termed Y2K a ``crisis.''
 &HT;    The GartnerGroup estimates that 180 billion lines of code need
to be examined and that 20 to 30 percent of all firms worldwide
have not yet started preparing for Y2K. Many of these are expected
to suffer significant failures.
 &HT;    In a series of studies issued over the last year, Gartner
surveyed 15,000 companies in 87 countries to assess their Y2K
readiness. The results weren't encouraging. Small companies rated
lowest _ for most, winning over new customers has taken priority
over the Y2K problem. But midsize and large companies are lagging
too. Gartner then rated the overall Y2K efforts of industrialized
nations on a scale of zero to five, where five is total compliance
on all systems.
 &HT;    The highest scorers on the scale, including the United States,
Canada and Australia, rated somewhere between two and three _ a
score that suggests they have completed an inventory of Y2K
vulnerabilities, but not yet developed a comprehensive remediation
plan.
 &HT;    The United States may be at the front of the pack in the Y2K
race, but that's small comfort to some legislators. Last March, the
House Subcommittee on Government Management, Information and
Technology warned that 37 percent of the critical systems used by
federal agencies will not be ready in time. Then in June,
California Republican Stephen Horn, who heads the subcommittee,
issued a scathing report card on the Clinton administration's Y2K
progress. He gave the government an F.
 &HT;    John Koskinen, head of the president's Year 2000 Conversion
Council, complains that Horn is just a tough grader. ``As a
government, we're in a C+ to B range,'' he argues.
 &HT;    Koskinen keeps a digital desktop clock that runs backward _ on
the day we spoke, the clock showed 609 days, 8 hours, 39 minutes,
16 seconds, and counting _ but he generally refrains from calling
the situation a crisis. Instead, he describes it as a ``critical
management challenge.''
 &HT;    He fully expects the federal government's critical systems to be
ready on time, or even early. ``Many companies, financial
institutions and federal agencies are still working on the
problem,'' he says. ``But most major organizations plan to have
their solutions in place by the first quarter of next year.''
 &HT;    If the council is successful, Koskinen believes, Americans will
confront little more than a few minor inconveniences when the year
2000 finally rolls around. ``There's not enough information right
now to indicate that stocking up on Coleman stoves and Sterno is an
appropriate response,'' he says.
 &HT;    And in the end, he predicts, ``a lot of people won't notice.''

 &HT;    ``In the next year or so,'' he predicts, ``the most common
cocktail party chatter will be, 'What are you doing to prepare for
Y2K?' But by then, it will be too late.''
 &HT;    His Y2K retreat is in an area of sagebrush country where high
security means a few strands of barbed wire clinging to a rusty
pole. Olmsted's chain-link fence is shiny and new. The
alarm-company sign that hangs from the fence would be more at home
in Brentwood, and on the roof there's a DirecTV satellite dish
pointed toward the sky. The shed outside his back door will hold
nonperishable food.
 &HT;    Olmsted intends to celebrate New Year's Eve at his home in the
suburbs; the place in the desert will be there just in case things
get rough.
 &HT;    The hardcores believe it will happen like this: On Jan. 1 (or
shortly thereafter), the electricity grid will go dead. Groceries
in America's refrigerators will go bad. Food distribution systems
will crash and store shelves will go bare within days. Businesses
will fail, either because they aren't Y2K compliant or because they
are dependent on noncompliant customers and suppliers.
 &HT;    As losses mount and companies go under, the stock market will
plummet. Banks will calculate interest for negative 100 years. The
government will stop issuing entitlement checks to gray-haired
senior citizens when their age suddenly clicks back to -35. Panic
will set in. Police dispatch systems will be crippled, and the only
law will be the law of the jungle.
 &HT;    Desperate citizens will abandon the cities to hunt for resources
in rural areas. They'll come looking for the mad prophets _ the Y2K
survivalists _ ready to plunder their food, their heat and their
communications links.
 &HT;    Millions of Americans have already gotten a small taste of
critical system failure. When the onboard control system of the
Galaxy IV communications satellite failed on Tues., May 19, 1998,
the outage temporarily crippled U.S. pager networks, several
broadcast news operations and even credit-card verifications
systems.
 &HT;    Most of the disruptions were brief _ technicians were able to
switch to backup communications paths _ but doctors who use pagers
as a lifeline with patients and colleagues were forced to set up
camp in hospitals and offices. The failure of one satellite threw a
wrench into the mechanisms of modern life, perhaps providing a peek
at what life may be like at the dawn of the new millennium.
 &HT;    Or sooner. While the full brunt of the Y2K bug is reserved for
AD 2000, some early problems are already developing. In 1996, Visa
and MasterCard temporarily stopped issuing credit cards with an
expiration date of 2000 after credit-card verification terminals
began choking on the ``00.'' The gaffe led to customer complaints
and a lawsuit filed by a suburban Detroit grocery store against its
computer supplier, TEC America Inc.
 &HT;    Since then, most verification systems have been upgraded, but
Y2K is making its presence known in other areas. The Information
Technology Association of America released a survey last March
showing 44 percent of the U.S. companies they polled have already
experienced Y2K failures. Ninety-four percent of the respondents
termed Y2K a ``crisis.''
 &HT;    The GartnerGroup estimates that 180 billion lines of code need
to be examined and that 20 to 30 percent of all firms worldwide
have not yet started preparing for Y2K. Many of these are expected
to suffer significant failures.
 &HT;    In a series of studies issued over the last year, Gartner
surveyed 15,000 companies in 87 countries to assess their Y2K
readiness. The results weren't encouraging. Small companies rated
lowest _ for most, winning over new customers has taken priority
over the Y2K problem. But midsize and large companies are lagging
too. Gartner then rated the overall Y2K efforts of industrialized
nations on a scale of zero to five, where five is total compliance
on all systems.
 &HT;    The highest scorers on the scale, including the United States,
Canada and Australia, rated somewhere between two and three _ a
score that suggests they have completed an inventory of Y2K
vulnerabilities, but not yet developed a comprehensive remediation
plan.
 &HT;    The United States may be at the front of the pack in the Y2K
race, but that's small comfort to some legislators. Last March, the
House Subcommittee on Government Management, Information and
Technology warned that 37 percent of the critical systems used by
federal agencies will not be ready in time. Then in June,
California Republican Stephen Horn, who heads the subcommittee,
issued a scathing report card on the Clinton administration's Y2K
progress. He gave the government an F.
 &HT;    John Koskinen, head of the president's Year 2000 Conversion
Council, complains that Horn is just a tough grader. ``As a
government, we're in a C+ to B range,'' he argues.
 &HT;    Koskinen keeps a digital desktop clock that runs backward _ on
the day we spoke, the clock showed 609 days, 8 hours, 39 minutes,
16 seconds, and counting _ but he generally refrains from calling
the situation a crisis. Instead, he describes it as a ``critical
management challenge.''
 &HT;    He fully expects the federal government's critical systems to be
ready on time, or even early. ``Many companies, financial
institutions and federal agencies are still working on the
problem,'' he says. ``But most major organizations plan to have
their solutions in place by the first quarter of next year.''
 &HT;    If the council is successful, Koskinen believes, Americans will
confront little more than a few minor inconveniences when the year
2000 finally rolls around. ``There's not enough information right
now to indicate that stocking up on Coleman stoves and Sterno is an
appropriate response,'' he says.
 &HT;    And in the end, he predicts, ``a lot of people won't notice.''

 FROM: Wired  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 World rights excluding Japan  
 &HT;    For the few of us into computers at Horace Mann in 1982, the
computer room on the third floor of Tillinghast Hall was the
greatest place at school. With its lead-paned windows overlooking
the football field, its polished floor and rows of terminals in
tidy rows, the computer room existed as our private library and
club room.
 &HT;    During free periods, when other kids might go outside to play
touch football or gossip in the cafeteria, I could be found
upstairs at a terminal, playing games and programming with my
friends. There, amid the silence, interrupted by the clicking of
keys and the soft tapping of chalk on the blackboard, we competed
fiercely to be the best programmers. It was a place where things
happened quietly, but explosively.
 &HT;    Pranks were a natural part of the room. I'd written programs
that fooled seventh-graders into thinking our shared computer, a
Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-11, was conscious. Others had
found ways to fool skilled programmers into thinking the computer
could no longer add properly (2 + 2   5!).
 &HT;    Creativity ran rampant. The walls were covered with elegant
``ASCII art'' _ pictures of Snoopy and the New York skyline we'd
made from collections of letters that from a distance assembled
themselves into an image. A few had mastered the eight-pen color
plotter, learning to produce marvelous geometric shapes, swirling
vortices and rippling landscapes.
 &HT;    The computer room was also a safe haven, a family of sorts. We
were mostly boys _ though a few girls spent time there _ and many
of us came from families with divorced parents.
 &HT;    I faced turmoil at home, living between my mom and dad,
separated from my sister. Another boy, Misha, faced such acrimony
at home as his parents underwent a particularly bitter breakup that
he threw himself into programming with relentless intensity,
eventually creating an after-school business writing programs for
Wall Street corporations and earning enough money to pay for
college himself.
 &HT;    In the computer room, all the worries of the real world faded
away, replaced by the exhilaration of the quest, a gleeful sense of
discovery and the joy of being best at something.
 &HT;    I was exposed to a remarkable computer curriculum, and nearly
everything I know about computers and technology comes from those
years on the third floor of Tillinghast. My friends and I were
among the first at our Bronx, N.Y., school, and in America, to have
computers at home. At 13 I owned an Atari 800 with 48K of RAM;
another pal, Jeremy Bozza, had an Apple II; Misha had a TRS-80;
others had Commodore 64s and VIC-20s.
 &HT;    It was a unique time, the Golden Age for computer and kid. The
machine was available to us unconcealed, stripped to its component
parts, at the same time when most adults barely understood what we
were doing. The evolution of the machine briefly matched the
evolution of our adolescent selves, becoming a vessel and partner,
a co-conspirator in our coming of age.
 &HT;    One of the rare adults who did understand computers was our
teacher, Mr. Moran. He was a big man with a red beard, red hair and
heavy forearms like a lumberjack's. His eyes were luminous
gray-blue, and he always wore silver glasses, which softened his
appearance, giving him an intelligent presence, as if he noticed
everything. He existed in my mind as a descendant of Vikings, a
benevolent warrior, at the helm of our ship, guiding the room
through waters of knowledge.
 &HT;    Mr. Moran left Horace Mann in 1988. Today he doesn't teach kids;
he teaches adults through the Global Knowledge Network, an outfit
that provides continuing education to corporate employees. For Mr.
Moran (his first name is Ed, but I still find it impossible to call
him anything but Mr. Moran), who has taught for 23 years, computer
education has shifted from learning how to program to a form of
digital bricolage where prewritten subroutines are linked together
to form programs.
 &HT;    Computers are now infinitely more powerful than they were when I
mastered them. They're also far more opaque. For a kid now, getting
beneath Windows 98 or Mac OS 8.0 is nearly impossible. Our priority
has shifted to teaching people how to be Power Users: dexterous at
using software, rather than creating it.
 &HT;    But using computers ``out of the box'' is a lot easier than it
used to be. Clicking on an icon requires less study than going into
a Basic programming environment. These ``friendlier'' systems have
broadened access and turned what was mostly a hobbyist subculture
into a part of mass culture.
 &HT;    What is lost is the idea that kids can ever learn to understand
computers, or that any of us, as computer users, can have
fundamental control over what they do. We're supposed to know how
to use the tools, not make the tools.
 &HT;    Mr. Moran taught us to make things, using the elements of
computing as our tools. The notion that we would become merely
educated consumers would have seemed ludicrous and unworthy as a
goal. I grew up feeling I really understood computers.
 &HT;    Back in the early 1980s, when computer education was in its
infancy, student-crafted software was essential to the curriculum.
Schools nationwide hadn't begun to invest in computer courses, and
few companies provided software environments for teaching below the
university level.
 &HT;    Mr. Moran, through organic evolution, trial and error, created
an open system, both in the way the computer functioned and in the
social fabric of the computer room. The machine and the kids
existed in symbiosis, each a part of the other.
 &HT;    Without the student system administrators writing programs,
updating software, managing the younger students, answering their
questions, Mr. Moran would have been incapable of being teacher,
guide, administrator and sometimes policeman. More important,
centralized control by one teacher was antithetical to the ethic of
exploration and gleeful discovery fostered by access to computers.
Mr. Moran recognized this and promoted a communal ownership of the
computer system.
 &HT;    This whole philosophy reflected the belief that for kids to be
well-educated, responsible citizens in the digital age, knowing how
computers worked would not be enough. Their education would be
incomplete without a genuine understanding of the moral and ethical
questions brought up by information technology. Who owns software?
Where does someone's electronic property or territory begin and
end? At what point do shared systems become public?
 &HT;    I couldn't have expressed these convictions outright back then.
They were ingrained in us as we went. As was a certain pride _
encouraged by Mr. Moran without any fanfare _ in what we were
accomplishing. We were not covering well-worn paths in our
learning. We were striking out, sometimes wildly, into a
little-known territory.
 &HT;    While I don't program anymore (the last time I programmed was in
1993, when I wrote databases for a management consulting company),
the experiences I had at home with my Atari and in the computer
room with Mr. Moran and my classmates have given me a perspective
that, no matter how opaque and turbocharged computers become, lets
me use them without feeling bewildered and dominated.
 &HT;    When I entered the computer room, as a student, I felt the
future was hidden there, waiting to be discovered. Today there are
moments between people in that room that stick in my mind as
permanent testaments to the kind of learning we experienced.

   THE MAIDEN KING &QC; 
The Reunion of Masculine and Feminine &QC; 
By Robert Bly and Marion Woodman &QC; 
Holt, 264 pp., $25 &QC; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Maiden King'' argues that male and female are opposites
that need not be in opposition, let alone mortal combat. As Robert
Bly and Marion Woodman see it, the war between the sexes is an
inner war of psychological maturity each of us needs to work out on
our own.
</P>
<P>
   For a collaborative work on the reunion of masculine and
feminine, the book is strangely compartmentalized. The authors
write separate parts of the book, joining only in a short preface
and the transcript of a telephone conversation at the end. When
they cite each other's work, they use first and last name. This
levels the playing field a bit, offsetting the fact that Bly, the
poet and Moses of the men's movement, is famous, while Woodman, a
Jungian analyst and author, is not. The formality lends the book an
unnatural stiffness, however, and hardly eases the sense of
testiness between male and female in our culture.
</P>
<P>
   Bly, author of the 1990 bestseller ``Iron John'' as well as many
books of poetry, does cast the larger shadow on these pages, which
in some respects form a thoughtful coda to ``Iron John.'' In that
much-maligned work, Bly urged men to reunite with their masculine
sides.
</P>
<P>
   Here, he says that they must do so with their feminine sides as
well. Indeed, the task of integrating masculine and feminine, the
authors write, confronts all men and women, gay or straight. When
Bly and Woodman discuss masculinity and femininity, they are
talking less about gender than about forces in the human psyche.
When a man and woman, or two men, or two women ``are together, four
are present,'' they write.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the book consists of back-to-back essays unpacking a
Russian folktale, ``The Maiden Tsar,'' in which a young man, Ivan,
is reunited with his inner feminine. A jealous stepmother puts Ivan
to sleep before a magnificent maid to whom he is betrothed; he
quests after the maid and in time succeeds, thanks to help from a
fierce old woman. This is a tale in which the men gather as well as
hunt, and the women hunt as well as gather.
</P>
<P>
   Where Bly's emphasis is on myth and the evils of literalness, as
well as the integration of male and female, Woodman, true to her
training, mines the story for its psychological insight. Her piece
is a call to reclaim our projections outward of the ``shadow''
within. Surprisingly, one highlight of ``The Maiden King'' is a
chapter in which she offers a stunning analysis of the mythic
dimensions of the life and death of Diana, Princess of Wales.
Contrasting the princess and the Maiden Tsar, Woodman hails Diana
as a fully feminine yet androgynous hero who fuses female
empowerment and male independence. The burst of grief at her death
represented a yearning for a queen figure who rejects perfectionism
and female subservience, who integrates masculine and feminine into
a stronger whole. As a man, I simply did not get what the fuss was
about Di. Now I get it.
</P>
<P>
   While sometimes penetrating, Bly's analysis, like his calls for
the summary execution of oppositional thinkers, can be tedious. His
section is a melange, part essay on thinking in mythic rather than
literal terms and part loosey-goosey social tractate, ruminating on
the difference between corn and corporate cultures and offering
nuggets such as ``The fact that judges in England still wear wigs
implies that women once decided matters of law.'' (Compared with
``The Maiden King,'' ``Iron John'' was a work of rigorous
scholarship.) Yet for all his pedantry, Bly has two things going
for him. He is often funny and often right, as when he holds that
contemporary culture infantilizes men and women.
</P>
<P>
   It is noteworthy that Bly defends ``Iron John,'' which he writes
was not meant to ``demonize'' women. It helps to recall the context
of that book: In the beginning, there was the truth, and only men
defined it. Then women said, ``We are not men.'' After a long time,
people accepted this notion, and by the 1980s in America,
contemporary culture had shifted toward the feminine. Then men,
noticing this, said, ``We are not women.'' And everyone seemed to
think that was strange. Drumming in the forest was equated with
misogyny.
</P>
<P>
   Bly writes that he was urging men ``to take a conscious part in
their own growth by respecting the wild part of themselves ...
rather than letting 19th-century masculinity, as defined by bishops
and businessmen, simply happen to them.'' When, as men or as women,
we let our gender consciousness ``simply happen'' to us, Bly and
Woodman write, we fall asleep as the Maiden Tsar approaches.

SAN DIEGO CAN'T COMPETE WITH THE BRONX ZOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Adds dropped material after 27thgraf: Padres history.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Tony Gwynn, 38 and feeling like a kid, took the No.
4 subway line from Manhattan to the Bronx last week. Finally, after
eight batting titles and nearly 3,000 hits, he was making his first
trip to Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn dropped off his bags in the San Diego Padres clubhouse and
made a beeline for Monument Park in center field. More than 400
feet from home plate, Gwynn walked among the monuments to Babe
Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Mickey Mantle and Miller Huggins. Behind the
monuments is a wall covered with 16 plaques commemorating assorted
other New York Yankees history makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first player you see is Babe Ruth, and that hit me like a
ton of bricks,'' Gwynn said. ``You think, `This is baseball.'''
</P>
<P>
   Yankee Stadium has been the center of the baseball universe for
so many Octobers. The stadium is 75, and it has been in the middle
of 35 World Series. If they win this series, it would be the 24th
time for the Yankees. The only thing in their way is a San Diego
franchise that has won one World Series game in 30 seasons of
existence.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees aren't the only ones involved in this World Series
who are steeped in tradition. The Padres have a history, too, and
it's one well worth stacking up next to the Yankees for
perspective's sake.

<P>
   Yankees tradition is Gehrig facing a crippling and fatal
disease, telling packed house that he is ``the luckiest man on the

in 549 at-bats in 1972.
</P>

   Yankees history is Mel Allen in the announcer's booth saying,
``How about that?'' and Rizzuto exclaiming, ``Holy Cow!''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Padres history is a mustard-yellow and brown uniform not worthy

MARYLAND GOP VETERAN TESTS THE LIMITS OF A TREND
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHESDA, Md. _ Newt Gingrich's charges in the House and Trent
Lott's minions in the Senate aren't the only Republicans running
away from the revolution they attempted to foment after taking over
Congress four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As always, veteran GOP crusader Ellen Sauerbrey is testing the
limits of a political trend, which ultimately reaches absurdity
itself.
</P>
<P>
   And because American election campaigns often resemble farce
more than drama, she might just pull it off and become the first
Republican governor since another champion of expediency, the late
Spiro T. Agnew, pulled the wool over Maryland's eyes 32 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, for example, the veteran legislator with the
worst record on environmental issues seen around these parts in
modern times showed up in Baltimore to oppose a new port facility
to receive imported cars and prepare them for shipment to dealers.
Sauerbrey did so, she said, in the interests of a fragile local
environment.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, she was actually shilling for an existing
facility, but the stunt was revealing.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Sauerbrey was a classic exemplar of in-your-face
conservatism in 1994, when her first campaign for governor came
just a few thousand votes (disputed by her for nearly two months)
of defeating Democrat Parris Glendening. And she was just as
in-your-face as a leader of the minority Republicans in the state
Legislature for the previous decade.
</P>
<P>
   As befits a movement conservative, she gave higher priority to
private property ``rights'' and business development in years of
confrontations with environmentalists. She opposed the state's
basic clean water law and its basic clean air law. She opposed
nearly every measure to protect the majestic Chesapeake Bay that
came her way as a legislator. And she has become the darling of
real estate developers and chicken processors for her stands
against wetlands protection and other enivironmental regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, her financial disclosure records show a large stock
portfolio worth nearly $2 million; nearly $400,000 of it is in
energy companies, whose liability from oil spills in the bay she
has voted to limit.
</P>
<P>
   The Ellen Sauerbrey of 1998, however, is symbolized by her
resignation a few weeks ago from the six-member board of Frontiers
of Freedom. Run by Malcolm Wallop, the former Republican senator
from Wyoming, this energy industry front is a key player in
movements to put property interests ahead of public health and to
get rid of pesky restrictions like the Endangered Species Act and
limits on drilling and mining in the vast Alaska wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the campaign to re-elect Glendening homed in
on the environment like a laser last month in a late start at
preventing Sauerbrey's strong effort to unseat him from getting
traction. And the protection of Chesapeake Bay became its symbol.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bay is the state's symbolic soul,'' the popular lieutenant
governor, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, told me as she staked out a
traffic island in rush hour here last week, in between dashes into
traffic to put bumper stickers on the cars of willing commuters.
``It is fishing and tourism and recreation, but it is above all
what makes Maryland special.''
</P>
<P>
   The bay also symbolizes what was probably Glendening's finest
hour in an otherwise ho-hum term when an outbreak of the dangerous
microbe pfiesteria in waterways from Maryland to the Carolinas
threatened fish and public health.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his counterparts to the South, Glendening pounced,
closing waterways to business discharges of waste. The crisis
resulted in virtually no damage to the state, in contrast to huge
fish kills and outbreaks of illness elsewhere. Through it all,
Sauerbrey criticized Glendening's moves, especially on behalf of
her poultry business supporters.
</P>
<P>
   But that was then, or so she says now.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the environment the only area where she campaigns as if
she had no past. In fact, very much like the congressional
Republicans, Sauerbrey has been tossing key elements of the
movement conservatives' revolutionary dogma _ antiabortion
positions, public school voucher advocacy, and opposition to gun
control of any kind _ overboard like so much ballast.
</P>
<P>
   The only exception to this self-abandonment has been on tax
cuts, though even here her position for another round has been
undercut by the absence of specific proposals for compensating
budget cuts, making her vulnerable to fears that higher property
taxes would be the eventual result of her program.
</P>
<P>
   What will keep Sauerbrey in position to win down the stretch,
however, is a factor that always matters _ an unpopular incumbent.
A remote figure, famous for ever-changing positions, Glendening has
only exacerbated the normal problems a New Democrat has in getting
strong party support.
</P>
<P>
   And Glendening has made his problems worse by first shunning and
then embracing President Clinton as the House was deciding to begin
its impeachment inquiry. The Republican right hates him anyway; the
damage from this Glendening flip-flop was from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   If Sauerbrey were running again as her 1994 incarnation _ her
evidence-lacking challenge of the '94 vote was even supported by
National Rifle Association money _ she wouldn't have a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   By running away from her record and beliefs, she remains in the
hunt, but the Sauerbrey campaign is an apt metaphor for what has
happened to the revolution. Winning is the new ideology.

THE DIRTY WORD OF THE 1998 CAMPAIGN: HMO 
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID PLOTZ 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A mere six months ago, Big Tobacco stood astride the American
political scene, the colossus of evil. Every Democratic politician
railed against it. Its public approval ratings trailed Linda
Tripp's.
</P>
<P>
   Then something funny happened on the way to the ballot box:
Democrats found themselves a new bogeyman to replace the tobacco
barons. The Dems' new ``merchants of death'': Health Maintenance
Organization bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 campaign's vilification of HMOs marks the culmination
of a remarkable and speedy collapse of the industry's image. Just
five years ago, HMOs were the golden children of the busted
health-care industry, imposing the cost controls and efficiencies
everyone agreed the system needed.
</P>
<P>
   But during this summer and fall, Democratic candidates have had
a field day telling HMO horror stories. HMO has become a synonym
for heartlessness and windfall profit, and political contributions
by health insurers are blood money.
</P>
<P>
   In the Missouri senate race, for example, a Democratic TV ad
declared that Republican incumbent Kit Bond would let ``insurance
company bureaucrats make your medical decisions'' because he had
accepted $200,000 from the insurance industry. An ad tarred
Illinois' Republican gubernatorial candidate George Ryan for
accepting contributions from ``exactly those HMOs that are charging
us more while providing us less.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Democrat Paul Johnson ran ads saying that incumbent
Republican Gov. Jane Hull ``has taken tens of thousands of dollars
from HMOs and big insurance companies and then steadfastly refused
to impose any meaningful reforms on an industry that is clearly out
of control.''
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, Georgia, Wisconsin, Kentucky, Texas, Florida,
Ohio and elsewhere, Democrats have anchored their campaigns to HMO
reform and depicted opponents as shills for the health insurance
industry. The issue is the key to ``almost every race I'm involved
in,'' says one Democratic pollster.
</P>
<P>
   HMO horror stories have spread widely and rapidly:
``drive-through'' baby deliveries, the experimental chemotherapy
denied to a child with cancer, the accountant who proposed
permitting cataract patients to have surgery on only one eye
because you need only one eye to see. (Consumers for Quality Care,
an anti-HMO group, even picks an HMO ``Casualty of the Day.'')
</P>
<P>
   All this is fertile soil for Democrats. Republicans in the
Senate, after all, did just kill a (relatively modest) HMO reform
bill. Republicans are in the pockets of the HMO and insurance
industries. (Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott's office told health
insurance executives to ``get off your wallets.'' And they did,
forking over millions to the GOP this election cycle.)
</P>
<P>
   And Democrats' proposed reforms are not elaborate and not
unreasonable: the right to sue your HMO, the right to appeal denial
of treatment, no gag rules for doctors and easier emergency room
access. One survey showed that 90 percent of Americans support such
changes, and 85 percent would favor a candidate who supports them.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its political logic, this vilification of HMOs is a
dismaying manifestation of a common illness of American politics:
Something-for-Nothingism. Democrats have seized the HMO issue this
fall because it is classic entitlement politics.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are understandably ambivalent about health insurance.
When your child gets sick, you naturally despise the frugality that
made your HMO so attractive when you subscribed. Americans want _
no, expect _ health care to be both infinite and cheap. We should
have everything, paid for by someone else who shall remain
nameless.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, by pushing regulation without acknowledging its
costs, are feeding this impossible expectation.
(Something-for-Nothingism is, of course, the guiding philosophy of
almost all politics. There is no reason health care should be an
exception.)
</P>
<P>
   A principled Republican response to the Democratic anti-HMO
campaign _ and a response that a few Republicans are actually
making _ is to say: ``OK, if you want to have the right to sue your
HMO, you are going to have accept x percent higher premiums and
that's going to price y thousand customers out of the health
insurance market.''
</P>
<P>
   But most Republicans, who are as willing to pander as the next
guy (heck, more willing), are afraid to fight on the merits.
Instead, they are countering one bogeyman with another, claiming
that voters should reject anti-HMO Dems because they are beholden
to trial lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Such a response is too bad, because a fight on the merits is
exactly the way Americans could make an informed decision about how
much HMO regulation they want.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that
Americans in managed care plans are basically content with their
own care. But they are more worried about the future than those in
fee-for-service plans. Why? Largely because they have heard so many
alarming tales about HMOs. Never mind that no hard evidence exists
that American health care has actually deteriorated under managed
care.
</P>
<P>
   This is why managed care is a genuinely confusing issue: Should
voters believe the anecdotes, which are real and horrifying, or
should they accept the evidence that people are mostly happy with
their own insurance, happy to be paying less, and as healthy as
they have ever been? Both parties in the '98 campaign offer an easy
answer to that question.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty for voters is that neither answer is completely
right and neither is completely wrong.

PUBLISHERS KEEP SALES FIGURES A CLOSED BOOK
</HEADLINE>
  By JUDITH SHULEVITZ 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is said that publishing is not a business but an art. Movie
executives are famous for knowing their box-office grosses, dollar
for dollar, the day after the movie opens.
</P>
<P>
   Not book executives. ``I'll call an editor and ask how a
client's book is selling, and he'll say 'Oh, gee, I don't know! Let
me check with inventory,'' an agent told me recently. ``But of
course, all inventory can tell you _ when inventory finally gets
back to the editor, three days later _ is how many books have been
ordered, not how many have been sold.''
</P>
<P>
   Not until much later (as much as a year later), after bookstores
have returned all their unsold copies, can publishers compile firm
sales figures. And even then, the numbers are not particularly
helpful. Did a book sell better in Topeka or San Diego? In the
spring or in the summer?
</P>
<P>
   There are ways to answer those questions, but the book industry
doesn't seem all that interested in the answers.
</P>
<P>
   Bookscan, for instance, is a system made and marketed by
Soundscan, the company that brings you the music industry's
greatest-hits charts. Soundscan gets its numbers from a scanning
device installed at checkout counters at more than 85 percent of
all music outlets in America. Bookscan is trying to put a similar
gizmo into bookstores. So far, it hasn't caught on.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Soundscan, which swept swiftly through the music business
after it was introduced, when Bookscan was unveiled last year, it
was dismissed by the American Association of Publishers, whose
official line on it was that it was too expensive. (Publishers
would have to pay Bookscan for the data.)
</P>
<P>
   Was that the real reason it was rejected? We don't know how much
Bookscan was charging, but wonder whether publishers really
factored in the savings they'd accrue from better-targeted
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   We asked around and came up with a few other theories of why
publishing is one of the last industries to seek the comfort of
hard numbers:
</P>
<P>
   1. Editors don't want to know exactly how well their books are
selling. It might force them to stop buying the kinds of books they
love publishing _ the serious books with limited sales.
</P>
<P>
   A corollary to this theory is that publishers don't want the
world to see how small the unit sales are for even world-famous
authors (they usually linger under 50,000) _ it might make the
whole industry seem a lot less glamorous.
</P>
<P>
   2. Hard sales data might eliminate a cash hoard publishers have
secured for themselves. It turns out that most contracts between
authors and publishers allow publishers to withhold as much of 40
percent of royalties against possible returns during the first year
of publication (and as much as 60 percent for paperbacks). Precise
point-of-sale data would obviate that clause, and force publishers
to fork over all royalties right away.
</P>
<P>
   3. The big chains have been quietly going into the business of
compiling book sales data themselves _ an obvious thing to do,
given their dominance of the retail market _ and don't want to give
up what amounts to a competitive advantage.
</P>

FRANK TALK ABOUT RACISM SPURS RECONCILIATION IN TEXAS TOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ Four months ago, civic leaders here bristled
when their East Texas town of 8,000 was labeled the ``town that
shamed America'' after the dragging death of a black man named
James Byrd Jr. Officials proudly noted the swift arrest of three
white suspects in the Byrd case, and then reeled off benchmarks of
racial progress in Jasper _ a black mayor, two black school
principals, a black chamber of commerce president, and a black
administrator of the town's largest hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Great strides, they said, for a southern town 45 percent
African-American and 55 percent white.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks, the town has gained a new perspective on
itself, this time from its own residents.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of 20 introspective town hall meetings, Jasper has
opened up to discuss what was never publicly discussed before _
racism. Blacks speaking at the neighborhood gatherings, sponsored
by the Mayor's Task Force 2000 committee, made it uncomfortably
clear that they see two Jaspers, separate and unequal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an eye-opener,'' said Nancy Nicholson, a white
councilwoman and a task force leader. ``I did not know the depth of
their sorrow and pain.''
</P>
<P>
   After Nicholson expressed how the revelations astonished her,
black minister John Hardin told her, ``I just wish you could live
in my shoes for one week and see what we go through.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's brutal killing, it seems clear, has spurred
reconciliation efforts such as the task force, as well as attempts
by individuals to repair past wrongs.
</P>
<P>
   Clifton Williams, a former school administrator and football
coach, said at a task force meeting that a white auto mechanic
recently apologized for having sold him a used muffler as a new one
years earlier, said the Rev. Michael Foshage, a Catholic priest.
The apology was accepted, but a refund was turned down.
</P>
<P>
   At another meeting, a white mother told how she casually
described a black man with a derogatory term, then confronted her
own racism when her teen-age daughter dressed her down, saying that
the man had caused no offense, Foshage recalled.
</P>
<P>
   A 17-year-old boy, known to use the N-word and disparage blacks,
was so moved by a Byrd memorial service that he tracked down his
church's youth director, Michael Hallam, to tell him, ``I no longer
have a drop of racism in my body.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Thursday night, 180 Jasper residents of all races
assembled on the courthouse lawn in a moving ``unity'' prayer
vigil, joined hands and sang hymns and the civil rights anthem ``We
Shall Overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How long would it have taken in the natural course of
progression to get a group like this together without this tragedy?
Maybe never,'' said Mike Ratcliff, a white attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Black City Council member Clyde Williams Jr., the task force
chairman who was a classmate of Byrd's, said that whites, until
recently, had been blithely unaware of the thinking within Jasper's
black community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racial tensions are like graph lines on a heart monitor,'' he
said. ``Whites only notice when it goes off the chart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's be realistic. If Jasper had not had this incident, we
would not be having this task force.''
</P>
<P>
   At a town hall meeting on the street where Byrd was slain, a
number of African-Americans maintained that they have been treated
differently by law enforcement officers and county officials. They
cited difficulty getting loans, jobs and equal treatment in stores
and car lots.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in questionnaires if racial discrimination was
``widespread'' or ``isolated,'' many of the blacks underlined
``widespread,'' penciling in that they had been subjected to verbal
insults or made to feel unwelcome in stores with ``unfriendly
facial expressions.''
</P>
<P>
   Few whites marked ``widespread.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We regret people feel that way,'' Police Chief Harlan
Alexander said of remarks critical of law enforcement personnel.
But he said efforts are being made to show that such views are no
longer valid.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   ``Both the sheriff and I have told our staffs to take a few
minutes to talk to people to dispel these ideas. `Stop when you see
someone mowing and ask what can we do for you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Such a suggestion, as well as proposed diversity training for
police officers and city workers, might help make clear that the
city no longer condones treating minorities as second-class
citizens. Convincing the black community that its long-held beliefs
might be outdated might require a communitywide effort, however.
</P>
<P>
   When a black woman complained that there were no blacks in the
county courthouse, a white assistant district clerk invited her to
stop by, Nicholson said. The black woman showed up one day and was
introduced to the two black probation officers and other black
courthouse employees.
</P>
<P>
   Both black and white community leaders have spotted remarkable
changes in this Piney Woods community since June.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first month after the murder, I thought it was a put-on
for the media,'' the Byrd family's pastor, the Rev. Kenneth Lyons,
said of the outpouring of concern and wholesale disavowal of
prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   ``But here we are in October, and relations between blacks and
whites are continuing to improve,'' Lyons said. ``People are trying
to bring about sincere harmony in the community.''
</P>
<P>
   The task force and its neighborhood meetings, Lyons said,
``might serve as an example for other communities in East Texas.
It's a sincere effort in Jasper, one that I've never seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes that Lyons has witnessed range from a heightened
level of common courtesy between the races _ holding a door at the
post office and stopping for a friendly chat _ to the appointment
of the first black drum major in the high school marching band and
a decision by the city to tear down the highly emblematic fence
dividing white graves from black in the Jasper cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Texas towns, Jasper had a segregationist past that
pervaded nearly all social contacts.
</P>
<P>
   It has come a long way from the days when the old Texas Theater
had a separate ``colored'' section, when it was disrespectful for a
black to make eye contact in the street with a white. As late as
the early 1970s, a bear of a white police chief named Alton Wright
would grab a black man for sporting a goatee, warning him not to
show his face in town until it was clean shaven. Most blacks knew
to cross the street when he approached, or to request a grocery
sack _ even for a single bar of soap _ to avoid arrest for theft by
Wright, both blacks and whites recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The senior prom was not held for a decade after the high school
was integrated in 1967, said Herman Wright, a black who won
community-wide respect while serving as school board president for
17 years. The traditional baccalaureate service in church before
graduation quietly resumed two years ago after being halted for
nearly two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Among suggestions made at the town meetings are providing
sensitivity training for teachers and local government employees,
including police and sheriff's deputies; efforts to ensure fair
employment; better communications between the races; and a public
swimming pool open to all.
</P>
<P>
   But what has already been achieved is a new willingness to
discuss once-touchy racial issues, said Williams, Nicholson and
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you have talked like this to me if we didn't have the
task force?'' Nicholson recalled asking a black member of the
panel, Delfine Summers.
</P>
<P>
   ``No'' was the frank reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear everyone's stories,'' Nicholson said of the
generations of personal hurts that have been aired at the town hall
gatherings. ``How can we deal with it unless we hear? Just the
telling can be powerful.''

PERSPECTIVE OF THE YOUNG REPRESENTED AS FRIDGE ART
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't you just love kids? There's never a dull moment in
parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   My oldest son was around 5 years old when he presented me with
his latest artistic masterpiece one afternoon. He'd been coloring
for hours at the kitchen table. I took the sheet of construction
paper, smiled and held it at arm's length while I tried to figure
out what the heck he had drawn. It looked like a spoon standing on
a rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, sweetie!'' I exclaimed. ``This is so pretty. I love the
brilliant colors, the orange and brown and green. Wow! It's so
vivid. The bold strokes give it such depth. This is clearly some of
your finest work. I'm going to put it on the refrigerator so
everyone can see it, OK?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's for grandma,'' he said proudly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great. She'll love it. We'll mail it to her tomorrow. She'll
probably put it on her refrigerator.''
</P>
<P>
   I was about out of room on my refrigerator anyway. There were so
many masterpieces there already that I could barely find the door
handle.
</P>
<P>
   Then my son asked, ``Doesn't grandma have one of those?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mmmm, I don't think so. She'll be so excited.''
</P>
<P>
   He frowned and responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``But all of my friends have one. Why doesn't grandma have one?
I thought she had one, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh dear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, son, Grandma doesn't have one like this one is what I
mean. Hers is a different color. She has one like ours. And what
color is ours anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   He looked at me like I was the stupidest mother he had ever had,
and then he started laughing. This was my first child, and I was
unaccustomed to being laughed at by my offspring. Now, of course,
I'm very accustomed to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mommy, do you know what it is?'' he asked suspiciously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, sure I do. It's ... a flower? A flower in a garden,
right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it a dragon eating a carrot?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, he was rolling on the floor, doubled over in merriment.
I had to laugh along with him. A child's giggle spreads faster than
chicken pox at a day care.
</P>
<P>
   Then my husband came into the kitchen and said, ``What are you
guys so tickled about?''
</P>
<P>
   I gave him the picture and he said, ``That looks like a spoon on
a rock.''
</P>
<P>
   My son said, ``Right, daddy! See, Mommy, Daddy knew what it
was.''
</P>
<P>
   I wondered if my mother really had a spoon on a rock. It must be
one of her gardening tools.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I kept that picture for years until it was accidentally
destroyed during our move to Texas. I used it to remind me that
children have a unique way of viewing the world. Innocence paints a
pretty picture of the world even when it is just a spoon on a rock.

OUT ON A LIMB OVER THE NAME OF A TOOL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: What is the origin of the term ``monkey wrench''?
</P>
<P>
   _ R.M.M., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: That question inspired the title of Vince Staten's 1996 book
``Did Monkeys Invent the Monkey Wrench?'' _ a book of hardware
lore.
</P>
<P>
   The term appears to come from Solymon Merrick, a machinist who
patented the wrench in 1835.
</P>
<P>
   Staten told Gannett News Service in 1996 that the earliest use
of ``monkey wrench'' he found dates to 1840 in Springfield, Mass.,
when Merrick devised a movable-arm wrench.
</P>
<P>
   This new wrench was manufactured for Merrick by a workman named
``Monkey'' White. ``Soon, other workers were calling the tool
`Monkey's wrench,''' Gannett reported.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a beautiful French Provincial baby grand piano made by
Ivers &AMP; Pond of Boston. I have never heard of this brand. Can you
find out more about this piano and how old it might be?
</P>
<P>
   _ G.B., Euless, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Ivers &AMP; Pond, founded in 1880, was one of Boston's better
piano makers for decades, according to Renato Pereira, a clerk with
the piano restoration company Premier Piano. President Kennedy
owned one in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   To determine the age of your piano, look for its serial number.
Ivers &AMP; Pond issued these numbers sequentially _ those below 77500
are for pianos built before 1930.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worth of a piano depends on the name _ Ivers &AMP; Pond is a
good one _ and the playability,'' Pereira said. ``It might be worth
$200 or might be worth $4,000. The only way to find out is to have
a piano technician look at it for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many other piano makers, Ivers &AMP; Pond was out of business
by the 1960s, but the brand name was bought by another pianomaker.
The last Ivers &AMP; Pond piano was produced in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, call Premier Piano at (800) 742-6639
((800) PIANO-39) or visit the Web site www.premierpiano.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I write to the actor Hugh Grant?
</P>
<P>
   _ K.S.G., Fiskdale, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to Grant in care of Creative Artists Agency, 9830
Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills, CA 90212.
</P>
<P>
   Grant, who turned 38 on Sept. 9, will portray a compulsive
womanizer in the upcoming Columbia Pictures film ``American
Neurotic.'' Other current credits include ``Mickey Blue-Eyes'' with
James Caan and Jeanne Tripplehorn, and ``Notting Hill'' with Julia
Roberts.

MOTHER OF TIBETAN JAILED FOR ESPIONAGE MAKES HER CASE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The tiny Tibetan woman sits quietly in a loft on
Boston's Commercial Wharf, her left arm looped around an 8-by-10
portrait of a young man, her right distractedly wiping imagined
smudges from the spotless glass of the frame. ``I keep this photo
with me day and night,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Then Sonam Dekyi, 63, rises and returns to her obsession _ to
free the youth in the photo, her only son, Ngawang Choephel, from
the Chinese prisons in which he is serving 18 years for espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Something comes over Choephel's unschooled, widowed mother, a
woman who has spent most of her adult life in refugee settlements
in India, when she walks downstairs and begins to speak to a small
crowd gathered to support her, her son, and the cause of Tibet. She
speaks with poise, firmness, and fervor.
</P>
<P>
   Choephel ``was interested and dedicated from the age of 13 to
preserving Tibetan music and dance,'' she says; that is why he
returned there from India _ to record the songs and dances of what
she calls a dying culture. ``He was not involved in any political
activity or crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Tibet's Chinese occupiers felt otherwise. They arrested him in
mid-1995, and convicted him late in 1996, of espionage in the
service of the Tibetan government-in-exile and an unnamed foreign
country. His cultural research was just cover, they said.
</P>
<P>
   In the two years since, Choephel has become the foremost symbol
of China's efforts to subjugate Tibet and repress its culture.
Partly that is the work of Tibet support organizations in the
United States, Europe, and India. Partly it is because of the
political and intellectual friends the young ethno-musicologist
made while a Fulbright Scholar at Middlebury College in Vermont in
the years just before his arrest. Most of all, it has to do with
his mother, who first camped out on the street in New Delhi and now
is on an international tour to draw attention to Choephel's plight.
</P>
<P>
   Dekyi, from the nomad region Ngari, left Tibet on foot in 1968.
She paused for a night on the trail to give birth to a baby, who
ultimately did not survive; her brother carried Choephel, then 2,
on his back. Her husband, Choephel's father, was arrested before he
could leave, and died, she says, after being tortured by the
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask you to look at my tragedy,'' she tells listeners at the
end of a presentation she planned to repeat yesterday at Harvard
and today at Brandeis during appearances sponsored by campus
chapters of Students for a Free Tibet. ``Empathize with me.
Understand my yearning. ... I have come to the United States with
great hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopefulness is an article of faith with most Tibetans, but news
from their country since Choephel's arrest has been almost
uniformly bad.
</P>
<P>
   The India-based Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy
says a reeducation campaign launched by the Chinese in 1996 and
intensified last year has led to the expulsion from Tibetan temples
of thousands of monks and nuns who refuse to renounce Tibet's
spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, and the closing of their places
of worship. The center says it documented 1,216 political prisoners
in jail in Tibet at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Dekyi and Choephel ``have undergone a great amount of tragedy
and suffering,'' says Tsering Norzom Thonsur, a member of the
Tibetan parliament-in-exile who is accompanying Dekyi as a
translator, ``and there are many such mothers, and thousands of
sons like Ngawang Choephel, languishing in jails inside Tibet.''
</P>
<P>
   As the campaign for Choephel's freedom has gathered steam, the
White House, the State Department, Democratic US Senator Patrick
Leahy of Vermont, and other members of Congress have raised
Choephel's case directly and in correspondence with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and Chinese ambassadors. But Chinese
officials have not responded, and Tibet, despite the efforts of its
exiles and foreign supporters, remains immensely remote from the
Western world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ethnic cleansing, the genocide in Kosovo, you see on TV
daily,'' Norzom says. ``The repression of Tibet, you just don't get
to see it.''

DREADLOCKS WEARERS FEEL FREE AT LAST 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  with art slugged dreadlocks 
 
By CLIFFORD PUGH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``He shall be holy and shall let the locks of the hair of his
head grow.'' _ Numbers 6:5.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A young woman solemnly stood up in front of the audience that
gathered in a building near downtown Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``My name is Courtney Wilson, and I'm a perm addict,'' said the
20-year-old Prairie View A&AMP;M nursing student.
</P>
<P>
   The room dissolved in laughter and nods of agreement. After a
lifetime of having their hair permed, pulled, fried, frizzed and
fashioned in unnatural ways, those who gathered for the National
Dreadlock Summit were thankful to say they were free at last.
</P>
<P>
   Free from chemicals that burned their scalp and neck.
</P>
<P>
   Free from hot combs and brushes that pinched their thick hair.
</P>
<P>
   Free from tight, heavy bathing caps they had to wear while
swimming because the relaxer on their hair didn't mix with water.
</P>
<P>
   Free from fashion magazines that dictate that bouncy, bubbly
hair is the only American ideal of beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Free to get back to their roots and be themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``God did not give me a permanent when I came into this world,''
Wilson explained. ``I just love my natural hair.''
</P>
<P>
   Hallelujah, come on, get nappy!
</P>
<P>
   That was the message of the gathering of about 50 women of color
and a smattering of men at a seminar about the beauty of
dreadlocks.
</P>
<P>
   Organizer Darlene Hosea planned the summit and an accompanying
youth arts festival to encourage creativity and individuality and
to discuss how to redefine what beauty means.
</P>
<P>
   ``Embracing our natural beauty begins with the hair on our
heads,'' Hosea said. ``Straightening our hair to emulate our white
sisters' standard of beauty just doesn't work for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people link dreadlocks solely with the Rastafarians of
Jamaica. But speakers at the Dreadlock Summit explained that
ancient Egyptians and such East African tribes as the Masai long
wore their hair in such a way.
</P>
<P>
   Dreadlocks result when the hair is so tangled that it naturally
assumes the shape of a rope. For many African-Americans and other
people of color, the hair naturally takes the form when washed and
dried without a comb or brush.
</P>
<P>
   After several months, the strands of hair become permanently
``locked'' and can only be removed by cutting them.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Bartolomey, a Houston child-care provider who has worn
locks for three years, said it took about seven months for her hair
to become locked. Maintenance is easy, she said, because all she
has to do is wash and condition her locks, which are about 4 inches
to 6 inches long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to make a political statement. I just think
locks are beautiful,'' she said. ``You don't have to have a perm to
be beautiful. Natural hair is beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Other women have discovered a feeling of empowerment from
wearing their hair in a natural way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so happy my hair is nappy,'' said Barbara Smith, a
Philadelphia-area television talk-show host who has spoken at
similar seminars around the country. ``I wish I could have said
that at an early age.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Smith discovered she had breast cancer. She
underwent surgery to remove the cancerous tumor and several rounds
of chemotherapy, in which her shoulder-length hair fell out,
leaving her bald.
</P>
<P>
   When the tiny strands of hair began to reappear, Smith decided
it was time to ``lock it on down'' because she didn't want to put
up with relaxers or other chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing we need to be doing is to put anything into our
bodies that will make it difficult for us to survive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She rejoiced as her hair slowly grew back. Each strand was
precious because it symbolized the great gift of life that had been
given back to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so amazed watching it come in that I didn't want to do
anything with it. I was afraid if I combed it, it would fall out,''
she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   As her hair grew longer, she gently twisted the curls until they
locked. Now she wears her locks in a chic style of varying lengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Locking gave me energy,'' Smith said. ``The longer the locks
went, the better my sleep (became), and my appetite increased. My
visions and dreams became so powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   Cemora Slatten, who has worn her hair in locks for about a year,
said she, too, feels a great sense of energy and well-being from
her hairstyle.
</P>
<P>
   She said co-workers at Johnson Space Center, where she works as
a word processor for a NASA subcontractor, have noticed the
difference since she clipped off her braids and changed her style
to dreadlocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It opened up a dialogue,'' said Slatten. ``I think people feel
better about me because there's an energy. They sense something
special.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she said, people sometimes want to touch her
dreadlocks, but she doesn't allow that because it dissipates the
energy.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, however, Slatten was not sure she wanted to
wear her hair in dreadlocks because she worried that co-workers
would not consider it a professional look.
</P>
<P>
   Even though there have been no repercussions at her office,
Slatten thinks she might not have been hired if she had applied for
a job with her current hairstyle because it seems threatening to
some people.
</P>
<P>
   Other participants agreed that they are often judged negatively
because of their hairstyle. One woman with well-kept dreadlocks
said that every time she goes through customs after returning to
the United States from a foreign country, she is taken aside and
often strip-searched for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Kenyha Shabazz, a Houston teacher and owner of an import store,
said he was stopped by Houston police two months ago and quizzed
because of his hairstyle.
</P>
<P>
   He said officers asked, ``What are you, some kind of
revolutionary?'' and took him to jail because he didn't have his
driver's license with him. Once in jail, he said officials cut
shells out of his dreadlocks and made disparaging remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so humiliating,'' Shabazz said. ``After all, it's just
hair.''
</P>
<P>
   A judge threw out the charge, but now Shabazz hides his hair in
a cap when he's driving to avoid drawing attention.
</P>
<P>
   A number of participants said some of the most heated criticism
comes from members of the African-American community, particularly
from parents and family members who worry that locks connote a
political statement and will hinder job prospects.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who hails from Nigeria said that whenever she returns to
her home country, her parents constantly badger her to cut her
locks and tease her that they will snip them while she is sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   She was consoled by Mbali Umoja, a poet and lecturer who has
worn dreadlocks for 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   Umoja, who has thick dreadlocks that flow past her shoulders,
said her parents went ``buck nuts'' for the first seven years over
her hairstyle. But gradually they came around when they saw her
qualities of strength, beauty and power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that standing firm makes a difference,'' Umoja said.
``Your strength and beauty and determination will bring them
around. You've got to take them along, sister, because you can't
leave them behind.'' &QL;

`MARIA THE STORM CLOUD' OFFERS UNPREDICTABLE SYMBOLISM _ BUT WHAT
DOES IT MEAN? 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By EVERETT EVANS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (HOUSTON) It's different, offbeat, a trifle goofy _ well, what
would you expect of a piece titled ``Maria the Storm Cloud,''
performed by a dance group called 33 Fainting Spells?
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle-based troupe usually consists of
dancer/choreographers Dayna Hanson and Gaelen Hanson. For their new
work, which premiered with weekend performances at DiverseWorks in
Houston and will play again Friday and Saturday, the team expands
to include Peggy Piacenza as the third performer and co-creator.
</P>
<P>
   The deadpan, unpredictable tone is set in a brief opening image.
The three women pose downstage wearing cutout cardboard clouds,
their bare shoulders and legs suggesting there's nothing else
behind the clouds _ recalling that old image of someone wearing
only a barrel. Each also wears a ``Hello'' name tag where the lapel
would be, if cutout cardboard clouds had lapels. Shyly, yet
winsomely, two of the women point to the ``Hello'' as if greeting
the audience. The third _ who plays odd-girl-out at several points
in the evening _ seems ill at ease and won't point to ``Hello.''
Blackout.
</P>
<P>
   I still don't know if I get it or not. Welcome to postmodernism.
</P>
<P>
   The evening progresses to dance sequences that often have the
women resourcefully exploiting three swivel stools _ posing on
them, spinning on them, lying back on them. Sometimes they lean
against the stools in three sharp diagonals, each propped against
the stool by one arm. A frequent device is to have two figures
moving in unison, with a third in opposition.
</P>
<P>
   A striking sequence makes use of restricted movement _ the three
women on their stools, facing away from the audience, moving in
contorted postures as their wrists test the limits of fabric
wrapped around them (which turns out to be the tops the woman will
pull over their bare backs before turning around).
</P>
<P>
   The trio renders the piece's muscular and eclectic choreography
with precision and drive.
</P>
<P>
   An early scene, set to chintzy lounge music, finds them playing
with martini glasses like kids acting out their elders' high jinks.
One steals an olive from the glass of another when the latter is
not looking. This I interpreted as a symbol of untrustworthiness
and competitiveness in contemporary relationships.
</P>
<P>
   One scene finds the three standing before microphones,
struggling to speak but too bashful to do so. An expression of
dancers' awkwardness in switching to language? A later dialogue
scene has two of the dancers giving the third a makeover: decking
her out in a platinum-blond wig, giving her a guitar to play and
telling her how she should feel. Perhaps a parody of daytime TV
talk-show blather?
</P>
<P>
   I found some of the visual and verbal non sequiturs moderately
interesting and mildly amusing but cannot say the work ever engaged
me fully. A lot of it exhibits the sort of deadpan hip that makes
you wonder if you're missing something or whether the whole thing
is just one long exercise in pulling the audience's leg.
</P>
<P>
   Yet performing-arts fans seeking something intimate and
idiosyncratic may wish to check out ``Maria the Storm Cloud.'' If
you don't like the dancing, you can always spend the evening trying
to figure out the significance of the meteorological title. &QL;

SHIRLEY MANSON PUTS GARBAGE IN THE GROOVE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOEY GUERRA 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Shirley Manson tried, she really did, to play the part
of sophisticated pop diva during Saturday night's sold-out Garbage
show at the Aerial Theater at Bayou Place.
</P>
<P>
   But after ripping through a few songs from the band's
dance-driven rock catalog, the fiery redhead announced she'd had
enough. With that, Manson pulled her hair (which she claimed had
been bothering her all night) back into a ponytail and traded her
heeled boots in for a pair of Nike tennis shoes.
</P>
<P>
   The action perfectly illustrated Manson's appeal. She coyly
flirted with the crowd one minute, asking what they thought of her
dress or telling one love struck male near the stage that he had
``a fabulous smile.''
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, she was jamming with the guys on her guitar or
commanding a slew of enthusiastic fans to ``Shut it, then!'' while
she told a story.
</P>
<P>
   Vocally, Manson is equally unpredictable. She's seductive and
yearning on ``You Look So Fine,'' strikingly self-assured on ``I'm
Only Happy When It Rains,'' and in kitten-with-her-claws-out mode
on ``Push It,'' the band's recent single that samples from the
Beach Boys and Salt 'n Pepa
</P>
<P>
   From the opening beats of ``Temptation Waits,'' Garbage rode an
electric groove that enveloped everything within striking distance
during its 105-minute set. Manson, her band, the music and the
crowd-surfing fans who lusted after their sweet-and-sour rock vixen
all swayed to the sinfully stylish sound.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't a lot of variation in Garbage's sound, just a
constant battle between heavy guitar riffs and glitter-ball
grooves. It was most apparent on songs from the band's second
album, ``Version 2.0,'' which pulses with an aggressive
infectiousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I Think I'm Paranoid'' was a seductive blend of distorted
vocals and seductive lyrics; ``Special,'' the group's new single,
was anchored by Manson's girl-group vocal stylings; and ``Push It''
benefited from searing guitar work and a hyped-up chorus.
</P>
<P>
   The musical evolution displayed in songs from ``2.0'' did
nothing to dampen the effect of songs from Garbage's debut album.
``Queer'' simmered with a sly sense of energy, and Manson bopped
around the stage to the chugging beats of ``Stupid Girl,'' one of
the band's best singles.
</P>
<P>
   Garbage briefly gave up the groove for a folksy flavor near the
end of the set on ``Supernatural,'' a mournful ballad from Vic
Chesnutt. Manson urged fans to show their appreciation during the
song, which was being recorded for release in the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't go overboard,'' Manson joked when the crowd threatened
to drown out her delicate vocals. ``We're not that desperate.''
Judging by the fervent reaction Garbage received throughout the
evening, Manson and her crew probably won't have to worry about
that for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Girls Against Boys opened the show with thunderous rock beats
and an animated stage presence. Lead singer Scott McCloud was
appropriately emotive on songs from the group's major-label debut
album, ``Freak On Ica.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyboardist/bassist Eli Janney nearly stole the show, jumping
around the stage and banging on his instruments like a caffeinated
jackrabbit. His enthusiasm was a welcome change from the somber
stylings that mark so many painfully cool rock acts. &QL;

BOTH LAWYERS', LITIGANTS' MONEY BANE TO COURT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ State District Judge Mike Westergren, a Democrat from
Corpus Christi running for the Texas Supreme Court, is definitely
swimming against the tide _ if not trying to climb a waterfall _ in
this election season.
</P>
<P>
   It's tough enough that the underfunded Westergren is trying to
unseat a Republican incumbent, Craig Enoch, in what is shaping up
as a watershed GOP year. But Westergren also has kind things to
say, sort of, about lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that Westergren is campaigning at a time when many
people seeking public office believe that they can attract almost
as many votes bashing lawyers as they can saying bad things about
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers have always _ as long as I can remember, anyway _
received more than their share of suspicion, sometimes even more
than news reporters and columnists.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' lawyers compounded the problem by spending millions
of dollars on judicial races in the 1980s. They succeeded in
electing a Texas Supreme Court that departed from Texas'
conservative tradition and rewarded them with decisions upholding
huge damage awards for their clients _ and large paydays for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Their tactics produced a backlash from doctors, insurance
companies and the business community _ the defendants who had to
pay the large damages _ and Texas soon had a defense-oriented
Supreme Court again.
</P>
<P>
   The business interests and their defense lawyers fought fire
with fire, making large donations of their own to defense-oriented,
mostly Republican judicial candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The ``reformers'' _ including some litigants and potential
litigants before the court _ insisted that they were rescuing the
Texas judiciary from the excesses of ``evil'' plaintiffs' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the word, ``plaintiff,'' got dropped in all the
rhetoric, but business contributors to Supreme Court candidates
definitely knew the difference between being a plaintiff and a
defendant, or being a plaintiffs' lawyer or a defense law
specialist.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer-bashing that became prevalent during the Supreme
Court's makeover _ and in legislative debates over civil justice
reform _ may have produced a curious result. It may have made it
more politically acceptable in today's conservative climate for a
potential party to a lawsuit _ someone with the most to gain from a
court's decision _ to make a large political donation to a judge
than for a lawyer to do so.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't make sense to Westergren, and he is trying to
challenge that notion in his longshot race for the high court.
Since he is not the favored candidate of the big contributors to
judicial races, though, he hasn't been able to raise enough money
to get his message across to many voters.
</P>
<P>
   Westergren, who has been a trial judge for 15 years, accepts
campaign money from lawyers, but he said he refuses donations from
litigants, the people appearing in his court whom lawyers
represent. A contribution to a judge from a litigant, Westergren
believes, is a ``far more pernicious thing'' than a donation from a
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   A litigant, he explained, has a direct interest in the outcome
of a case _ perhaps a multimillion-dollar interest _ while a lawyer
is a professional who, win or lose, will likely represent clients
before the court in a number of other cases.
</P>
<P>
   Enoch, the Republican justice whom Westergren is challenging,
said his Democratic opponent has a point.
</P>
<P>
   He called Westergren's comments ``fairly accurate'' and said he
also felt more comfortable, as a judge, raising money from lawyers
than from the parties they represent in court.
</P>
<P>
   But Enoch said he tries to raise no more than about half of his
campaign money from attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the remainder _ and Enoch is swamping Westergren in
fund-raising _ comes from business-oriented groups.
</P>
<P>
   Enoch believes the public is more concerned about judges
accepting contributions from lawyers than from businesspeople and
other litigants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with the public's perception of the court,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   If so, it's a perception that ``reform''-minded candidates, such
as Enoch, helped to perpetuate with their bashing of plaintiffs'
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the entire system of electing judges in partisan
elections and allowing them to accept large campaign contributions
from both lawyers and litigants is ``pernicious.''
</P>
<P>
   Enoch and most, if not all, of his colleagues on the present
high court favor changing the system. But they continue to play by
it, racking up thousands of dollars in special interest donations,
because the Legislature _ aside from setting generous donation
limits _ has refused to change it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone is going to have to say, `No,' somewhere,'' laments
Walt Borges, a consumer advocate who monitors the court.
</P>
<P>
   That's a worthy thought, but it would mean unilateral
disarmament, a concept considered more pernicious by most judges
and would-be judges than the system itself.

INVESTIGATIVE JOURNALIST BECOMES PART OF THE STORY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Should a reporter continue to cover a story when he or she is
drawn into that story as a participant, rather than an observer?
</P>
<P>
   Boston defense attorney Cheryl M. Cronin answers with an
emphatic no. She maintains that WBZ-Ch. 4 reporter Joe Bergantino
ignored a conflict of interest in reporting the outcome of a state
hearing at which he was forced to testify _ with a sometimes-testy
cross-examination by Cronin _ and in which a previous Bergantino
story was the sole piece of evidence introduced.
</P>
<P>
   But Channel 4 news director Peter Brown fired back yesterday at
Cronin, asserting that the attorney's criticism is simply ``an
attempt to get Joe off the story ... push him out of bounds'' to
spare her client, state Representative Emmanuel Serra, from further
probing by Bergantino.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is the latest chapter in an investigative story that
has featured some memorable moments, including footage of
Bergantino chasing Serra through a parking garage and down a State
House sidewalk, calling after him: ``Why are you running away, sir?
Gus, why are you lying about where you live?''
</P>
<P>
   In that story July 13, Bergantino reported that Channel 4's
investigative unit had discovered that Serra, while purporting to
live in a house in East Boston, was actually living in an apartment
in the North End, outside the district Serra represents, in
violation of state law.
</P>
<P>
   But the current sparks are flying over Bergantino's follow-up
story on Sept. 28, which reported the findings of a state Ballot
Law Commission hearing on the matter, at which Bergantino
testified. In Cronin's view, it was an ``extremely unfair'' story
that raised questions about ``the appropriateness of a member of
the news media purporting to cover a story as if they were an
objective observer, when in fact they're not.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bergantino contended Monday that his reporting was not
colored by the fact that he testified on a minor point, essentially
authenticating a tape of his reporting. ``I don't believe my
answering a couple of questions tainted my objectivity or
influenced the way I reported the story,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, several media ethicists contacted by the Globe
said Channel 4 should have assigned a different reporter to do the
follow-up.
</P>
<P>
   Bergantino's original report caught the notice of James R.
Loring, Serra's Republican opponent. Loring filed a challenge to
Serra's candidacy with the Ballot Law Commission, arguing that
Serra ``lacks the legal qualification for the office he seeks''
because he allegedly lived outside the district. Bergantino was at
the commission's Sept. 28 hearing with a Channel 4 cameraman,
intent on a follow-up story.
</P>
<P>
   Bergantino told the Globe Monday that he did not know he would
be called on to play another role, that of witness, though he said
that before the hearing, he did talk to an attorney for CBS,
Channel 4's owner. ``Being under instructions not to testify, I
didn't think it would be an issue'' to cover the follow-up story,
said Bergantino. ``If the lawyer had said, `Yeah, you're going to
have to testify,' I would have gone to Peter Brown and said,
`Peter, I think you should have someone else cover this.'''
</P>
<P>
   Once the hearing began, Bergantino was called as a witness
anyway. He told the panel he was willing to authenticate the
videotape of the July 13 story for the commission, but balked at
testifying beyond that. At that point, commission chairman Robert
Hallisey threatened Bergantino with contempt and a stiff fine.
</P>
<P>
   During a recess, Bergantino called Brown, the news director, and
an attorney. It was decided that Bergantino would authenticate the
tape for the commission but go no further, and not answer questions
about the news-gathering process. Brown acknowledged Monday that at
that point, he weighed whether Bergantino should continue to cover
the story: ``Did that go through my mind? Sure it did. But I
decided it was not an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   It was to Cronin. Though Bergantino stuck to his guns and
largely confined his testimony to saying that the tape in evidence
was indeed the story he reported, he and Cronin sparred during the
cross-examination over whether any other elected official besides
Serra had ever refused to answer his questions. They also had a
contentious exchange over how many times the I-Team's camera had
been set up outside the North End apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the cross-examination ended, the commission
rejected Loring's challenge to Serra.
</P>
<P>
   According to Cronin, Bergantino then ``scurries over to me with
a microphone in his hand, and a camera facing me, and asks me to
describe my reaction to the commission's decision. It occurred to
me at this moment that he actually intended to continue to cover
this story as if he could offer the viewers an objective
perspective, despite the fact he had just been a witness in the
case and subject to cross-examination.'' She said that ``it was
clear from the report that aired that night that Mr. Bergantino was
very unhappy with the commission's decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Bergantino, however, says ``the same objectivity that guided us
in the first story guided us in the second story,'' and that the
core of the story was the commission's decision, not the fact that
he was called to testify. Brown agrees, saying it was ``a fair and
balanced piece.''
</P>
<P>
   The report Bergantino aired that night described the decision by
the commission, with a sound bite from Cronin, brief remarks from
Hallisey and Loring, and a replay of the Serra-chase footage. At
the end, Bergantino raised the question of why the state Republican
Party did not send an attorney to represent Loring, and suggested
that one reason could have been the fact that Serra supported
Republican acting governor Paul Cellucci, adding, ``By the way,
there are reports that in return, Serra will get a high-paying job
at Massport.'' Bergantino said Monday that the speculation about
Serra's job prospects was ``based on several sources.'' Serra could
not be reached for comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the Sept. 28 report, Channel 4 anchor Liz Walker
told viewers that the Ballot Law Commission had required Bergantino
to testify, and that he had authenticated the videotape.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that disclosure, the ethicists contacted said the
possibility of the commission's questioning Bergantino should have
prompted Channel 4 to assign another reporter to the Sept. 28
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the journalist becomes an issue, the station should
remove the journalist from the story,'' said Marvin Kalb, director
of Harvard's Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and
Public Policy.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thistle, director of broadcast journalism at Boston
University and former news director at WCVB-Ch.5, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The practice in my news operation was that if you were part of
a story for whatever reason, someone else would cover the story,''
he said.

BUSINESSES PRAISE ARRIVAL OF SILICON VALLEY COMMUTER TRAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYCHE HENDRICKS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The first commuter trains rolled into the
booming Silicon Valley this week, bringing hope for the region's
technology companies that the ride will reduce stress from grueling
drives on crowded highways.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Area transportation planners also applaud the Altamont
Commuter Express service, which runs 85 miles from Stockton to San
Jose, but say it won't make a dent on traffic congestion because
the real problem is that housing growth south of San Francisco
hasn't kept pace with the job boom there.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good news, bad news kind of thing. It's good that
(the train) is there, but its bad that it has to be there,'' said
Bill Hein, deputy director for the Metropolitan Transportation
Commission. ``This is an example of trying to solve with
transportation a problem that shouldn't exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that problem is that people are fleeing, going to the
(Central) Valley to find housing for jobs in Silicon Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   Just the same, Carl Guardino, president of the Santa Clara
Valley Manufacturing Group, a consortium of Silicon Valley's
biggest companies, said the new rail line was cause for
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got the champagne on ice, thousands of employees in line
and we're very excited about this service,'' Guardino said.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Clara Valley Manufacturing Group has been pushing for
the commuter train for five years, in an effort to get employees to
work in less time and with less stress.
</P>
<P>
   Two trains a day will leave Stockton, at 4:12 and 5:22 a.m., and
arrive in San Jose about two hours and 20 minutes later, after
making stops in Manteca, Tracy, Livermore, Pleasanton, Fremont and
Santa Clara. Buses and company shuttle vans will deliver riders to
their jobs. Evening return trips will depart from San Jose at 4:15
and 5:45 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The train could provide real relief for some of the 50,000
Silicon Valley workers Guardino estimates now commute from homes in
the Central Valley and Tri-Valley areas.
</P>
<P>
   One of those workers, Dave Simpson, has been driving a 140-mile
round-trip commute from his home in Manteca to his job at Intel in
Santa Clara. Simpson was delighted to finally have an alternative
to the grueling drive over the Altamont Pass and down clogged
Interstate 680, the Bay area's second-most congested corridor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gonna give my car to my oldest son. It's a ploy to make
certain I use the train,'' he said. ``If the train does not work, I
have no backup plan. This is a man almost in desperation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Altamont train, known as the ACE, was working fine on its
inaugural day Monday. Brian Schmidt, manager for maintenance and
equipment for the ACE Authority, the government agency that runs
the service, said the two trains carried nearly two-thirds of their
total combined capacity of 1,200 riders. Almost 90 percent of those
riders had already bought monthly passes _ which range in price
from $59 to $279, depending on the distance travelled.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting off with two trains,'' he said, ``but as demand
increases, we're looking into increasing the frequency of
service.''
</P>
<P>
   The train offers commuters an alternative to crowded freeways,
said Colin Jones, a spokesman for Caltrans, the state
Transportation Department. But, he admits, it won't actually take
that many cars off the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to help, but it's not going to solve all the
traffic problems. It's still kind of a drop in the bucket,'' he
said. ``You'd have to run definitely a few more trains to see a
dent.''

MEMOIR OR FICTION: BOOK ON DEATH CAMP SPARKS DEBATE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH P. KAHN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Masterpiece or masterful hoax? The question, swirling around an
award-winning memoir set in the Nazi death camps, is sparking
debate among Holocaust scholars over the veracity of the book's
author and the validity of ``recovered memory'' marketed as
historical truth.
</P>
<P>
   The book, ``Fragments: Memories of a Wartime Childhood,'' by
Binjamin Wilkomirski, was published in Germany by Schocken Books in
1995 and appeared in English translation a year later. Critics were
effusive in praising Wilkomirski for his bloodcurdling portrayal of
Nazi atrocities _ including the murder of his father _ as witnessed
by the author, then a young Jewish boy from Riga, Latvia.
Wilkomirski, who was adopted by a Swiss family after the war,
credits psychotherapy with helping him excavate memories so
brutally detailed that as one critic was moved to write of
Wilkomirski, ``his sanity seems a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   The book became an instant classic of its genre, in part because
the narrator is so young and vulnerable. Quoting from the Kirkus
Review, the book's dust jacket calls ``Fragments'' an
``extraordinary memoir'' and ``a real-life Grimm's fairy tale.''
But are the memories therein authentic? Not according to Swiss
writer Daniel Ganzfried, who reported in a Swiss periodical this
summer that Wilkomirski never set foot in the Auschwitz or Majdanek
concentration camps he claims to have inhabited as a child.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, according to documents found by Ganzfried, Wilkomirski
was born out of wedlock in Switzerland in 1941 and adopted by a
family named Doessekker. Bruno Doessekker, as the boy was named,
grew up in Zurich and Biel. While ``Fragments'' may make for
unforgettable reading, Ganzfried says, it should properly be
labeled fiction, not autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fragments'' has been both an international bestseller and a
critical triumph. Translated into a dozen languages, the book has
won a National Jewish Book Award and the Prix de la Memoire de la
Shoah, among numerous honors.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkomirski's publisher is standing behind the book's
authenticity, at least so far. And Wilkomirski himself, a musician
and violin maker, has put forth the defense that he is a victim of
bureaucratic foul-ups by the Swiss. Readers have always been free
to view his book as either literature or memoir anyway, Wilkomirski
suggests.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, he neither disavows the labeling of his book
as nonfiction nor concedes it has been misrepresented to a
worldwide audience.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers have been unsettled, to say the least, by this
blurring of the line between fiction and history, especially with a
subject such as the Holocaust, in which an estimated 6 million Jews
died. It was not long ago, for instance, that filmmaker Steven
Spielberg dedicated profits from ``Schindler's List'' to a project
that documents memories _ real, verifiable memories _ of survivors
who outlived Hitler's Nazi death camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read this book as a remarkable novel and was surprised when
Wilkomirski said it was a memoir,'' says retired Simmons College
professor Lawrence Langer, an authority on the Holocaust, who
encountered Wilkomirski at a conference last spring at the
University of Notre Dame. ``This is now a scandal of large
proportions. I'm getting e-mail from survivors now saying, `What
else are they going to do to us? Now they're making up stories
about us.'''
</P>
<P>
   Langer is concerned about what he calls ``cranks'' using the
scandal to discredit Holocaust memories in general, and about the
gullibility of publishers who would accept a work like this on face
value _ without supporting documentation.
</P>
<P>
   Brandeis University professor Anthony Polosky, who has edited
several volumes of Holocaust diaries, agrees that in a world where
Holocaust remembrances can be ascribed by some fringe elements to
``a Jewish plot,'' scrupulousness must be the first line of defense
against historical distortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You first must ask, is this genuine?'' says Polonsky. ``Then
you must ask, why did the Swiss and Germans swallow this hoax?
Finally, what should the Jewish community's reaction be? I feel
they should say this is deplorable, no matter the book's literary
merit.''
</P>
<P>
   Polonksy's comments stand in sharp contrast to sentiments voiced
by the Jewish Book Council in New York, which awared ``Fragments''
a prize for autobiography. Director Carolyn Hessel declined to
comment on the controversy last week, except to say the council's
board had agreed the award had been given ``with the best of
intentions'' and now, as Hessel put it, ``It's time to move on.''
But move on where?
</P>
<P>
   Academics who have used ``Fragments'' in courses certainly seem
divided on where to proceed. Bentley College English professor
Alicia Nitecki, who recently returned from Germany, where debate
over the scandal's implications is particularly heated, says she
feels duped by Wilkomirski and betrayed by his publisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like apologizing to my students,'' says Nitecki,
adding, ``Scandals like this feed into Holocaust denial. This one
is spectacular because the book was so highly acclaimed.''
</P>
<P>
   Historian Deborah Lipstadt of Emory University, on the other
hand, thinks there is room for ``Fragments'' on her bookshelf
because she uses it as a companion to other Holocaust novels, and
did so well before the current controversy erupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must realize,'' says Lipstadt, ``that whether this is fact
or fiction makes no difference in the history of the Holocaust.
Nobody writes the history of Auschwitz based on one memoir, or two
or three. In that sense, it adds nothing to those who want to deny
the Holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
   Lipstadt also notes that Wilkomirski is hardly on a par with
Elie Wiesel, the Holocaust survivor and author honored with a Nobel
prize for his work. Others point to Wilkomirski's work in
``recovered memory'' therapy _ a process called into question in
many high-profile cases involving child abuse charges _ as one more
reason to be cautious about the author's motives.
</P>
<P>
   Says Lipstadt, ``I think he may even think it's the truth. That
doesn't make it history, though.''

BILL WOULD BAN AMMO SALES DURING TWO HOLIDAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RACHEL GORDON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Two city supervisors have proposed banning the
sale of ammunition within city limits for the seven days before the
New Year's Eve and the Fourth of July holidays to discourage
revelers from firing guns in celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation is designed to save lives and stop further
violence in San Francisco,'' Supervisor Michael Yaki said. ``We
believe that this is something that can make the holidays safer for
passersby.''
</P>
<P>
   Yaki said he would encourage neighboring cities to approve
similar legislation to create an ``ammunition-free zone'' in the
region during the two holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Bullets fired into the air during celebrations have fallen back
to the ground, sometimes causing fatal injuries as well as property
damage, Yaki said.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco police have not kept statistics on how many
injuries have occurred from falling bullets. Still, the police
said, the concern is real. A study conducted by King-Drew Medical
Center in Los Angeles tallied 118 injuries and 38 deaths from the
unrestrained firing of guns during a seven-year period there.
</P>
<P>
   The city police and the U.S. Park Police support the legislation
proposed by Yaki and Supervisor Mark Leno. The park police have
primary jurisdiction over Ocean Beach, the favored spot in San
Francisco for gun enthusiasts who like to fire their weapons on the
holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a big problem at the beaches in San Francisco,'' said
police Capt. James Smith. He said stray bullets have hit cars and
condominium apartments in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Only two stores in the city sell ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Laws such as the one Yaki and Leno propose already exist in Los
Angeles and two other Southern California cities, Compton and
Solana Beach.

IT'S HARD TO FIND THE BIG MAN ON CAMPUS ANYMORE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No heads turn when the football captain strolls across Harvard
Yard to his government class. ``None,'' Brendan Bibro testifies.
``That's the total truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibro is a big man _ 6 feet, 250 pounds sans cleats and pads _
but he is not a Big Man, not the way he would have been back when
the gridiron king was a tin god around Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Harvard is coming off its best season in three
decades and Bibro is the first man in modern times to be captain
for two years, he's just another passing face. ``I would say 99
percent of people here have no idea who I am,'' Bibro says. ``And
the other 1 percent play alongside me.''
</P>
<P>
   What used to be called the BMOC _ the Big Man on Campus, the
stereotypical football star with Betty Coed on his letter-sweatered
arm at a fraternity party _ has vanished, certainly at colleges
around Boston.
</P>
<P>
   With student bodies now coeducational and dramatically more
diverse than they were in the '50s and '60s, the Big Man has been
supplanted by a dozen or more mid-sized BMOCs (and increasingly,
BWOCs) who operate in decidedly narrow orbits.
</P>
<P>
   They run student governments. They edit the newspaper. They run
interfraternity councils. They direct volunteer organizations. They
perform in singing groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more egalitarian,'' says Kevin Duffy, Boston College's
vice president of student affairs. ``There are microcommunities on
campus now, each with their own leaders.'' BC hasn't had a classic
BMOC since Doug (Little Big Man) Flutie, the quarterback who led
the Eagles to unexpected glories in the early '80s and won the
Heisman Trophy as the nation's top football player.
</P>
<P>
   The most familiar face on The Heights these days probably
belongs to Patrick McMahon, who made himself ubiquitous while
getting himself elected undergraduate government president last
spring. ``I was out there in a T-shirt, handing out fliers and
trying to shake everybody's hand,'' shrugs McMahon.
</P>
<P>
   The campuses are so multi-culti now, with dozens of activities
from Caribbean culture clubs to ultimate Frisbee teams, &UR;  &LR; that the
likelihood of one person's being viewed as a BMOC is remote. ``I'm
not sure there'd be that widespread agreement about what the
standard would be,'' says Bobbie Knable, dean of students at Tufts
University.
</P>
<P>
   The standard used to be whatever 21-year-old white males agreed
it should be. But the rich diversity of student bodies now _
racially, ethnically, geographically, culturally _ has made the
very idea of a Big Man moot. ``Unless you can identify with the
BMOC,'' says Maia Heyck-Merlin, a Tufts senior, ``he's not going to
be a BMOC to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Heyck-Merlin, president of the Leonard Carmichael Society, the
umbrella group for the 700 students who do volunteer work, may come
as close as anyone at Tufts. Since the Carmichael Society is the
biggest organization on campus, she has ex-officio visibility. But
Heyck-Merlin is just as happy to stay out of the limelight. ``I'm
behind the scenes,'' she says. ``I'm like the woman behind the
curtain.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when colleges stress inclusion and group activities
and teamwork are prized, few students want to be seen as the Great
Oz. If you're head and shoulders above the crowd, you might get
your block knocked off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm flattered, but I don't think BMOC is a title I would
want,'' says McMahon of BC. ``I would hate for students here to
think that I thought I was this big popular guy that everyone
wanted to be with. It would be a little too arrogant, a little too
pompous.''
</P>
<P>
   The BMOC came from a time before the Great War, a product of
Gothic towers and ivy-covered stadiums and secret societies and
prep-school values, ``... that worship, seldom named, never really
admitted, of the bogey Big Man,'' as F. Scott Fitzgerald observed.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Man was the embodiment of everything collegiate America
admired. He was athletic, handsome, sociable, heroic, democratic,
intelligent (but not intellectual) and, most importantly,
conformist. ``Play the game as others are playing it,'' an
upperclass clubman advises Dink Stover, embryonic Big Man, in
``Stover at Yale.'' ``It's a big game and it'll follow you all
through life.''
</P>
<P>
   Hobey Baker, Princeton University's blond and graceful demigod,
was the model for the BMOC. ``There at the head of the white
platoon marched Allenby, the football captain, slim and defiant,''
Fitzgerald wrote in ``This Side of Paradise,'' ``as if aware that
this year the hopes of the college rested on him ....''
</P>
<P>
   Baker was Princeton (and America) in 1914, just as Pete Dawkins
was West Point (and America) in 1958. Dawkins, a dentist's son from
Detroit, was football captain, class president, first captain of
the cadet corps, and a Rhodes scholar. Everyone wanted to be Pete
Dawkins _ until Vietnam turned campuses upside down.
</P>
<P>
   With students burning draft cards, marching in demonstrations,
holding deans and Dow recruiters hostage, and taking strike votes,
nobody cared who the football captain was. ``There was an emphasis
on what was happening outside the university,'' says Duffy of BC,
``as opposed to what was happening on campus.''
</P>
<P>
   The BMOC now headed Students for a Democratic Society, wore a
headband, and made non-negotiable demands through a bullhorn.
``Alma mater died between 1968 and 1972,'' says Sol Gittleman, the
Tufts provost, ``and the idea of the BMOC went with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Colleges went coeducational and coresidential. Admissions
offices searched coast to coast and beyond for blacks, Latinos,
Asians, and Native Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Boston College was a male commuter school in 1968. Now, it has
an Asian Caucus, a Club Latino Espanol, a Philippine Society, and a
Cape Verdean Association. Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
once the bastion of the buzz-cut white male nerd, is more than 40
percent female and nearly a third Asian.
</P>
<P>
   Tufts, whose 4,600 undergrads now come from more than 100
countries, has four recognized a cappella groups _ male, female,
coed, and Jewish. ``It'll never look like the yearbook of 1955
again, and you wouldn't want it,'' says Gittleman. ``It's a
different country.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Cramer walks into Jay's Deli, and the counterman says
``Sing on, brother.'' He strolls across the quad, and passersby say
``Great job last night!'' ``The president gives me a hug every time
he sees me,'' marvels Cramer. ``Who else gets a hug from the
president?''
</P>
<P>
   Cramer is president of the Beelzebubs, Tufts's legendary a
cappella group. Almost everybody has squeezed into Goddard Chapel
to hear the 'Bubs. Their CDs and tapes are on sale at the
bookstore, and they have their own Web site (www.bubs.com). ``I'm a
soloist,'' says Cramer, ``so I'm a recognizable face.''
</P>
<P>
   So is Marvin Venay, a Boston University senior from Pittsburgh
who has brought back the NAACP campus chapter after a 15-year
absence and broadened it beyond its African-American base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our definition of color does not just consist of black,''
Venay says. ``We're multicultural. I'm very visible, so I'm pretty
well known.''
</P>
<P>
   Visibility and diversity are the keys to being a BMOC or a BWOC
now that campuses have been atomized into dozens of microgroups.
``Once classes are over, everyone goes everywhere,'' says Erica
Pfister, an MIT junior. ``People belong to two or three groups, but
nobody belongs to the same two or three.''
</P>
<P>
   So the students whose names and faces are known either run one
thing that lots of people care about or get involved with several
things, like Susan Rushing does.
</P>
<P>
   Rushing, an MIT senior who was a Miss Maryland contestant (``I
was the interview winner'') and spent last semester singing opera
in Milan, runs a peer counseling group on health issues, was on the
ballroom dancing team, and may join the new cheerleading squad.
</P>
<P>
   She's as well known as any of the faces floating along the
``infinite corridor'' beneath the Dome. ``But I would never have
thought of myself as a BWOC,'' Rushing says. ``That's pretty funny,
actually.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rushings and Cramers and McMahons and Heyck-Merlins smile
when they hear the B-word applied to them. It's so old school, as
they say on campus. So sis-boom-bah.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the gridiron king is just another gov major from
Pittsburgh. Harvard's football captain glances at a framed
photograph showing the stadium filled to the colonnade in 1915,
when everyone on campus knew who the Big Man was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at that picture, and it's amazing,'' Brendan Bibro
says. ``They don't come across the bridge too often now _ unless
Yale's in town.''

<P>
   THE MARRIAGE OF BETTE AND BOO
</P>
<P>
   Play in two acts by Christopher Durang.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Marcus Stern. Set, Molly Hughes. Costumes, Karen
Eister. Lighting, John Ambrosone. Produced by the American
Repertory Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Have you always disliked ``Long Day's Journey Into Night''
because you couldn't get past the ``It's a Wonderful Life''
optimism? Did you walk out of ``The Butcher Boy'' because it seemed
like such a wistful evocation of the innocence of childhood? You
stopped watching ``Married ... With Children'' because Al and the
family were too darned likable? Did you put down ``Angela's Ashes''
in disgust because too few of Frank McCourt's siblings died?
</P>
<P>
   If so, the American Repertory Theatre has the play for you, a
revival of Christopher Durang's ``The Marriage of Bette and Boo.''
Durang takes family dysfunction to the breaking point, but the
problem is that when this bough breaks, down comes ``Bette,''
babies and all. ``The Marriage of Bette and Boo'' is an abject (to
say the least) lesson in how bleak chic can seem like the cat's
meow of hipness when written, but turn into a self-contented,
bloated pussycat when the years show how little talent lies behind
those claws.
</P>
<P>
   Bette and Boo are a Punch and Judy for our times. Bette's a nag
who delivers one dead baby after another (save for Durang stand-in
Matt). Boo takes after his boorish drunk of a father, who uses his
dimwitted wife like a dishrag. Bette's parents aren't any shining
lights themselves. One of Matt's sisters is a religious maniac, and
the other is a Norman Bates wannabe.
</P>
<P>
   In his notes to the 1985 autobiographical play, Durang says,
``Unless you go through all the genuine angers you feel, both
justified and unjustified, the feelings of love that you do have
will not have any legitimate base and will be at least partially
false. Plus, eventually you will go crazy.'' In itself, that's an
astute psychotherapeutical assessment about recovering from the
neuroses of family life and is, in this context, a refreshing break
from the trendy, and moronic, view that families have little to do
with how one turns out.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the artist's job to get beyond therapy, to coin a
phrase, to give us more than a primal scream of discontent. Edward
Albee's ``Three Tall Women'' is a case study of taking the detritus
of dysfunction and, through an act of artistic imagination,
infusing it with a rich, theatrically poetic life of its own. Using
a similarly surreal vernacular, though Durang owes more to Ionesco,
``Bette and Boo'' is too purgative to be either poetic or
cathartic.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to believe that the fault is with the ART production
and cast, as talented a collection of darkly comic pranksters as
Durang could hope for. Thomas Derrah, Will LeBow, Paula Plum, and
Karen MacDonald are as dependable as ever, while Caroline Hall (as
Bette), Kristin Flanders, and, most of all, Remo Airaldi equal the
more established veterans and maybe even take things up a notch. If
the object is to get us to like these basically unlikable
characters in spite of ourselves, only Randall Jaynes's drunken Boo
fails to deliver. Matt Chiorini as Matt, who also narrates, is
blandly effective. That seems to be as much as Durang has asked of
his stand-in, who, like Durang, is trying to make order out of
chaos, but unlike the character's hero, Thomas Hardy, finds only
chaos. Director Marcus Stern's confident staging and Molly Hughes's
delightfully sloping set provide a suitably disorienting framework.
</P>
<P>
   Airaldi as the heartless, and homosexual, Father Donnally, makes
the most of his physical humor, especially his imitation of bacon
sizzling on the griddle. He also summarizes Durang's credo: ``Why
didn't they think before they got married? Why does no one ever
think? Why did God make people stupid?''
</P>
<P>
   But beyond wallowing in a ``Married .... With Idiots'' cry of
the heart, Durang gives us too little in the way of honed dialogue,
imaginative metaphor, or blackened humor to make us want to see
Bette and Boo renew their disavows. There are times when the
exaggerated characters represent the heartbreak that all families
mete out for varied reasons and in varied doses. For the most part,
though, Bette and Boo are Durang's cross to bear. If his family is
anything like that, then we can only congratulate him for
channeling his problems into playwriting rather than bloodletting.
So to end on a positive note, who says theater can't save lives?

HALLOWEEN IS NOT JUST FOR CHILDREN ANY MORE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not long ago, Halloween was almost exclusively for kids.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, though, it's also a holiday for adults _ and a $2.5
billion bonanza for merchants selling party supplies, beer, candy,
and costumes to baby boomers who like to dress up as characters
from such recent movies as ``Austin Powers,'' ``The Mask of
Zorro,'' and ``Scream 2.''
</P>
<P>
   And with Oct. 31 falling on a Saturday this year, 1998 could be
the best-selling Halloween to date, some retailers predict.
</P>
<P>
   Halloween has ``turned into an adult celebration,'' said retail
manager Terry Anderson of Boston Costume Co.
</P>
<P>
   Two explanations are offered for the sudden surge in Halloween's
popularity _ Hollywood hype and baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many movies today include a Halloween costume line as
part of their promotional marketing and licensed tie-ins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Movies and TV shows are really driving the product,'' said
Mark Arvanigian, whose family owns several Halloween Outlet stores,
including stores in Framingham and Worcester.
</P>
<P>
   And while children and young adults have always been eager to
dress up for trick-or-treating, baby boomers seem especially
susceptible to marketing pitches for high-rent costumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby boomers may have grown up but they still want to have the
same amount of fun,'' said spokesman Chris Strano of Spencer Gifts
Inc., a chain that bills itself as Halloween headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; if,,.1l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Forget generic witches and goblins. The rule of costuming these
days seems to be: If it's licensed, people will wear it.
</P>
<P>
   Besides ``Teletubbies'' and ``Blue's Clues'' costumes, many
catalog retailers such as Learn &AMP; Play feature costumes based on
corporate icons.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, discerning trick-or-treaters can masquerade as the
Pillsbury Doughboy or Tony the Tiger this Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet perhaps, costumes inspired by the McDonald's
fast-food menu are available for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``With these costumes, the whole family can dress up like an
Extra Value Meal,'' said Mary Miller, vice president of global
marketing for McDonald's Corp. ``One person can be the shake,
another the fries, and somebody else can be the Big Mac.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Miller, costumes are a ``logical extension'' for
the fast-food chain because both McDonald's and Halloween are about
``family, children, and fun.''
</P>
<P>
   In the annals of marketing synergy, the folks at Spencer Gifts
may have outdone themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The retail chain, which also operates Dapy stores, is a
subsidiary of Universal Studios. And when Universal released
``Bride of Chucky'' over the weekend, a much-anticipated event for
film fans of the splatterfest genre, Spencer already had updated
Chucky products ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   If Hollywood studios are cashing in on stimulating demand for
Halloween merchandise, nightclubs and radio stations have learned
that Oct. 31 can be a windfall for them, too.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure that middle-aged trick-or-treaters are not all dressed
up with no place to go, many clubs and restaurants now throw some
version of a costume ball.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Massachusetts Bay Line offered just one Halloween
harbor cruise; this year, it plans to offer three.
</P>
<P>
   ``Halloween is one of those holidays that people like to go out
and celebrate,'' said Shane Lemay, the cruise line's marketing
director. ``It's not like Thanksgiving.''
</P>
<P>
   Celebrating Halloween in costume can be a thirsty business for
the adult party animal, and for that reason brewers have seen a
nice jump in October beer sales in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a spike-up in October,'' said senior vice president
Frank Walters of Impact, a newsletter that tracks the beverage
industry. ``A large part of that percentage comes from the
promotions that beer makers run around Halloween.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewers shipped 1.2 million barrels of imported beer to US
retailers last October, a nearly 9 percent increase over shipments
for the previous October, Walters said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just costumes and beer that are Halloween big sellers;
it's also spooky home decor, scary music, and strings of orange
Christmas-style lights that Martha Stewart devotees can use to
complement the old jack-o'-lantern.
</P>
<P>
   There's even a scarecrow that a home decorator can stick
outside, said Dennis Oberholzer, seasonal merchandise manager at
Bradlees Inc., the Braintree-based discount chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scarecrows are a blowout this year,'' he said of sales.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's gotten to the point that home decorating at
Halloween is ``almost as elaborate as Christmas,'' he said.
``Driving home, I'm amazed at all the orange lights up on people's
homes and all the elaborate paraphernalia.''
</P>
<P>
   Candy, of course, is a major seller. According to a consumer
survey from American Express, Americans bought $950 million of
candy at Halloween last year, and retailers that benefit most from
Halloween sales are discount chains and drugstores.
</P>
<P>
   For years, American Express has been doing sales surveys around
Christmas and the back-to-school season. For the first time, it has
conducted a Halloween sales survey.
</P>
<P>
   From a retail standpoint, Halloween has gotten too big to
ignore, explained American Express spokeswoman Judy Tenzer.
</P>
<P>
   Of adults interviewed, 45 percent said they plan to celebrate
Halloween with at least as much vigor as New Year's Eve, and they
plan to spend an average of $81 each on partying and Halloween
knickknacks.
</P>
<P>
   At the National Retail Federation, spokesman Scott Krugman said
Halloween ``started to get on our radar screen in 1995.''
</P>
<P>
   What showed up on that radar screen was a proliferation of
stores such as those in the Halloween Adventure chain.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Halloween Adventure consisted of two brothers selling
novelties in Philadelphia parking lots. Today the company opens
about 140 stores in August and September on short-term mall leases,
then shuts them down a day or two after Halloween, said chief
operating officer Joe Purifico.
</P>
<P>
   Two such stores, at CambrideSide Galleria and the Northshore
Mall in Peabody, sell ``Saturday Night Live'' conehead costumes and
clown outfits for the family dog, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   According to Purifico, such seasonal stores fill crucial
vacancies for big mall operators looking to maximize profits.
</P>
<P>
   At Hallmark Cards Inc., Halloween is only the eighth-biggest day
of the year for exchanging greeting cards, but one of the
fastest-growing. From 1994 to 1997, the industry saw sales rise 23
percent to $39 million, said spokeswoman Michelle Buckley.
</P>
<P>
   At Spencer Gifts, meanwhile, key operatives are already gearing
up for Halloween 1999, said spokesman Spano.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a full crew that works all year-round,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because most costumes are made in China, factories need long
lead times. As a result, it can be tough to respond nimbly to
instant trends, such as when Monica Lewinsky was elevated to the
status at which some Halloween revelers may wish to impersonate her
at some of this year's tonier costume balls.
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry, said Anderson of Boston Costume. ``Our Monica
masks just arrived.''

   IRELAND-HUME _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ About 15 years ago, John
Hume _ who last week won the Nobel Peace Prize _ built a little
stone cottage on a spit of land overlooking the River Foyle in
Donegal, just a few miles over the Northern Ireland border. The
chances of his being assassinated were somewhat diminished on this
remote and windswept promontory. Hume liked to sit in his yard and
watch ships ply the Foyle on their way to and from Derry. He smoked
too many cigarettes while he stared out to sea. I sat with him in
his yard a few times. He told me more than once that this was the
last bit of Ireland seen by emigrants as they sailed to America and
Canada. How sad, he would say, that after almost everybody was
driven out of Ireland, those few who remained took to killing each
other. (Reid, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   MICROSOFT-JUDGE _ Last December, when Microsoft Corp. insisted

decided to find out for himself. With help from a courtroom
technician, the judge was able to ``uninstall'' his own Explorer
Internet browser in about 90 seconds. So Jackson ordered the
software giant to begin selling Windows 95 separate from its

   HAVE-NOTS _ WASHINGTON _ More Americans view themselves as
``have-nots'' rather than ``haves,'' according to a new Gallup poll
designed to measure American perceptions of fairness and
opportunity. A decade ago, only 17 percent considered themselves
``have-nots,'' and today it's 25 percent. Today, according to the
poll, the number of Americans reporting economic deprivation ranges
from 11 percent who said they did not have enough money for food,

without the bickering reminiscent of the old-time, name-calling
contests that years ago were an election-year staple in Texas, both

attention to who will be the state's 27th land commissioner, a job
created 161 years ago when Texas was still a republic. Here's a
look at the two men who want the job. (Ward, Austin

DAY-TRADERS FIND THEIR MONEY GONE ALONG WITH COMPUTERS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today the little storefront on Chauncy Street is empty, the
banks of blinking computer terminals gone. Gone too are the amateur
stock traders who once thought they could play with the big boys on
Wall Street _ and so is their money.
</P>
<P>
   What the storefront is, say state regulators, is a testament to
just how risky day trading can be.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the Massachusetts Division of Securities became the
first regulator in the country to file an action against a
day-trading firm and one of its most publicized players, Blocking
Trading Inc., the now-defunct Houston concern that not long ago
relished its reputation as ``The Bad Boys of Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   While Block Trading hyped itself as the little guy's alternative
to the sophisticated trading advantages enjoyed by the big Wall
Street players, the reality turned out to be something very
different, regulators say. The one thing that the restaurant
managers, medical technicians, and grandmothers who paid to trade
stocks in Block Trading's Chauncy Street office shared was this:
Every one of them lost money.
</P>
<P>
   Day trading, propelled by the long bull market, gained in
popularity the last few years by catering to individual investors
who buy and sell stocks full-time over sophisticated computer
systems at the firms' offices. Day traders make rapid-fire
transactions, holding a stock for a minute, two minutes, maybe
four, looking to make one-eighth or one-quarter point _ 12.5 cents
or 25 cents _ on a stock and then hopefully bailing out with the
profit.
</P>
<P>
   But the tide has turned against the day-trading firms, which
have seen their profits slashed by new competitors and
deep-discount Internet brokers as well as a shaky stock market. At
least three day-trading firms have failed recently, including Block
Trading, which ceased trading three weeks because it could not meet
the capital requirements of the stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts complaint filed Monday charges that Block
Trading and its current and former executives engaged in deceptive
marketing to attact investors; allowed customers to improperly
allocate profits and losses to different accounts; and improperly
encouraged customers to borrow money from the father of one of
Block Trading's founders.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; if,,.4l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The division is seeking to revoke Block Trading's right to do
business in Massachusetts, and is seeking fines against the firm
and its executives. The regulators said they launched their
investigation last year shortly after the Block Trading operation
was featured in a page-one Boston Capital column. The Boston office
closed earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State William Galvin, who oversees the Securities
Division, called day trading ``a perversion of technology,'' used
to lure in unsophisticated investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hold all the cards,'' Galvin said of the day-trading
firms. He added: ``We're anxious to put out the word that day
trading is not something we want to see in Massachusetts until or
unless there is a more honest system.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher M. Block, chief executive of Block Trading in
Houston, said his company, which once had 24 offices and revenues
of about $20 million a year, ``is looking at bankruptcy.'' He
defended the concept of the little guy as day trader, but
acknowledged making money was not easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't anything people were compelled to do,'' Block said
in a telephone interview. ``It was their decision when to start and
when to stop trading.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Jennings of Indiana University, who along with academics
at Notre Dame and the University of Delaware has studied the effect
of day trading on the stock market, was cautious about the
prospects for amateur traders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some people who still make a decent living day
trading, but for the average person today that's probably going to
be the exception rather than the rule,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts complaint also charged that Block Trading, in
violation of federal rules, encouraged its customers to borrow
money for trading, including money from Dr. Gene Burke, a Houston
doctor who is the father of Jeffrey S. Burke, president of Block
Trading.
</P>
<P>
   Block Trading customers were typically required to have $50,000
to $100,000 in capital to begin trading. The complaint says that of
the 68 accounts at the Boston Block Trading office, 44 used
borrowed money for trading. At least one couple filed a complaint
saying they had lost about $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Block, the firm's chief executive, said loans of $10,000
to $100,000 from the elder Burke ``were not uncommon on a daily
basis'' to customers. But he said the lending ``was completely
separate and apart'' from the firm. ``We never encouraged it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Block and its key Houston executives, the Massachusetts
complaint also named Jeffrey Bowman, who managed the Boston office,
and an associate, Adam Baruchowitz. The complaint says Baruchowitz
was the only trader who ultimately made money at the Boston office.
Neither Bowman nor Baruchowitz, both recently working as traders in
New York, could be reached for comment.

SOME ANALYSTS ARE BETTING ON A SLOW-LEAK RECESSION 
</HEADLINE>
   News Analysis  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BERNARD D. KAPLAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ For decades, economists said that another massive
depression was impossible because of protective measures that
nations took after World War II to tame financial speculation and
keep trade flowing in tough times.
</P>
<P>
   Then, unforeseen shocks starting last year with financial panic
in parts of Asia and the threatened collapse of Japan's seemingly
invincible banking system revived fears that a Great Depression
might happen again after all.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, opinion among some analysts has begun to swing
back. Many of them, while accepting the possibility that a
recession may be on the way, insist that recent events show it will
be kept within manageable limits.
</P>
<P>
   They explain their comparative optimism by noting that after a
hesitant start, inter-governmental institutions like the
International Monetary Fund, which bails out shaky national
economies, the U.S. government, which has the resources that make
it vital to global prosperity, and big individual banks have
recognized the need for large-scale action and are beginning to
move.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, critics derided a conference of the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Washington for failing to come
up with emergency measures to halt the downward slide. Instead, the
meeting dealt chiefly with proposals for steps to shore up the
global economy at some later date.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some experts now are revising their views, contending that
the conference, although short on fresh ideas, put the world
economies on notice of the need for immediate changes to keep an
unpromising situation from worsening.
</P>
<P>
   As former French finance minister Edmund Alphery put it: ``The
boom is over, but that doesn't mean a `bust' is inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   He foresees a period of lower prices, slightly declining
international trade and much less spectacular economic expansion
than that of the mid-1990s. But he said none of this would lead to
greater political instability or ``bread lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Paris-based financial consultant Frank Satsumi noted that
several influential European banks had dismissed their top
officials, signaling the changes now underway. The United Bank of
Switzerland, for instance, axed its four senior executives in the
same week.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were fired for big losses incurred through imprudent
lending,'' Satsumi said. ``It was a warning shot to international
bankers to alter their ways _ or else. Private lending from now on
will avoid the kind of excessive risk that caused such trouble in
Indonesia and other Asian countries. But that doesn't mean a credit
crunch, which would dry up international trade, will result. A
middle way can and will be found.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there may be moves to liberalize trade further and faster
than otherwise expected, according to Frank Allyn, a adviser to the
British finance ministry. ``The United States has begun to put
pressure on the (15 nation) European Union to loosen its
restrictions on imports from Asia and Latin America,'' he observed.
``It's hard to see how Europe can oppose the idea as strongly as it
might have done if a recession wasn't threatening.''
</P>
<P>
   Allyn also credits the Clinton administration for keeping a
steady eye on Latin America to insure there is not another Mexican
peso crisis. ``The problems of Brazil and Argentina will be
contained (by Washington),'' he predicted, ``thereby providing
another safety net against a depression.''
</P>
<P>
   These analysts say U.S. and other markets will continue a
gradual downward trend, sporadically interrupted by upward spurts.
But they all discount the likelihood of a 1929-style market plunge.

<P>
   The shock of the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
in 1995 overshadowed, in some measure, Israel's celebration of its
50th anniversary three years later.
</P>
<P>
   Rabin was not merely the country's leader but one of the pillars
of its survival: a hero in the 1948 War of Independence, the
Israeli Defense Force (IDF) chief of staff in the 1967 Six Day War
and the man who as defense minister masterminded the withdrawal
from most of Lebanon after the debacles of 1982-83 and is said to
have ordered his troops to break the bones of the youthful
stone-throwers of the intifada. He was also the Nobel Peace
Prize-winner who presided over the opening to the Palestinians. His
life spanned the full half-century of his country's existence.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Rabin's assassin, Yigal Amir, was no marginal man, no
fantasist like John Wilkes Booth, no lonely oddball like Lee Harvey
Oswald. He was, rather, the product of some of Israel's finest
institutions: the elite Golani infantry brigade, a prestigious
religious nationalist yeshiva, and arguably the best law school in
the country. He was religious but not a member of the
ultra-Orthodox extreme.
</P>
<P>
   The Rabin assassination inflicted a wound on the Israeli polity
that will take decades to heal. It revealed, as in one horrible
flash of lightning, the gap between religious and secular, between
zealots for the land and those willing to sacrifice it, between
those willing to take large risks for peace and those who view such
gambles as trifling with survival.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the murder of Rabin struck a blow at yet another myth
_ that no matter how much bickering and bitterness pervade Israeli
politics, in the end these are merely words, and the nation will
stand together.
</P>
<P>
   That myth, like most myths, rested on a very considerable
element of truth. When a series of suicide bombins this decade in
the hearts of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv caused horrible carnage,
secular Israelis glued to their televisions saw squads of bearded
ultra-Orthodox men magically appear to collect, with reverent care,
every dismembered limb, every scrap of human flesh, every drop of
clotting blood for decent burial.
</P>
<P>
   These unpaid volunteers, responding within minutes to pagers
summoning them, were of the same ilk as those who throw rocks at
cars driving on the Sabbath. Indeed, in some cases they were the
same people. For a few moments, these grisly acts of mercy
suspended the ferocity of disagreements about state subventions to
seminaries, draft exemptions and Saturday road closures.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's success in thwarting the very real threat to its
existence in its first decades requires little retelling. In a
series of wars _ some short, some long, some marked by desperate
clashes of tens of thousands of soldiers, some by ambushes and
raids by mere squads _ Israel managed to convince its enemies that
it could not be defeated by conventional means, that prolonged
insurgency or guerrilla struggle would not bring it down and that
even unconventional threats would only elicit cunning and violent
preemption or the most terrible retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   A cardinal assumption of Israeli statecraft _ universal and
implacable hostility on the part of its immediate neighbors _ was
never entirely accurate (Jordan, in particular, often found itself
in clandestine alliance with the Jewish state). But by the 1990s,
it had become completely irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   An Israel at formal peace with Jordan and Egypt, in negotiations
with Palestinians who a few years before would never have
considered sitting down with representatives of the Zionist entity,
and with a foreign service stretched to maintain legations in all
the countries eager for ties is not the embattled Israel of old.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Israel's existence in a state of perpetual siege had
its terrors, but to a large extent it had simplifying comforts as
well. It relieved Israel of the need for a complex statecraft
toward the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   The siege helped ensure solidarity within a diverse population,
sympathy from without, and support from Diaspora Jewry. Above all,
it relieved Israel of the need to wrestle with the original and
most durable conflict of all: the contest with the Arabs of
Palestine for a small plot of land to which both peoples had a
powerful claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel may not be at peace,'' remarks Reuven Gal, a sturdy
former paratrooper and onetime chief psychologist of the IDF, ``but
Israelis have decided that they are at peace.''
</P>
<P>
   When they voted in 1996 for the Likud's Netanyahu, they did not,
as some outsiders feared, vote to end the peace process but merely
to slow it down and get a better deal than they expected from
Shimon Peres' dreams of a new Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu himself has, without fanfare, given up his party's
ideology, which once stood foursquare against relinquishing
territory to the Palestinians. The prior quarrels within Israel and
between Netanyahu and the Clinton administration have really been
over percentages, pace and details.
</P>
<P>
   A Likud government will probably witness the birth of a
Palestinian state _ and will accept it because most Israelis will
wish it to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Israel will have to forge a new and more subtle statecraft. If
it fights more wars (and it well may, for it still has real
enemies), it must fight them in a political world that has known
formal peace and to which peace may return.
</P>
<P>
   No longer can Israel's internal problems be subordinated to what
Israelis still call ``ha'matzav'' _ ``The Situation'' _ the daily
and enduring security threat. It endures in the form of Hezbollah
ambushes, Hamas bus bombs, Palestinian Authority guerrilla warfare,
or Iranian or Iraqi missiles armed with weapons of mass
destruction. But serious as each of these are, they no longer loom
over Israel in quite the same way security threats did for the last
70 years of Jewish settlement.
</P>
<P>
   By now, that Israel is the most pro-American country in the
Middle East goes without saying; it has, after all, benefited from
American friendship and largesse and fought its battles using
American weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But the Americanization of Israel goes far deeper. English is so
much Israel's second language that one can live quite comfortably
without knowing a word of Hebrew. American fashions fill the stores
and American academic fads sweep university departments.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most powerful arguments for direct election of the
prime minister (an innovation introduced in 1996) was that it would
give rise to American-style political decorum and stability (which,
of course, it did not). But when Netanyahu gave a gracious victory
speech after ousting Peres in 1996, commentators noted proudly that
he had spoken just the way a successful American pol would have.
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, Israel's fascination with America mirrors the
general extension of American culture throughout the world. But it
also reflects the natural intertwining of two very different
societies _ one tiny, one vast _ in which Jews can without mental
tricks or self-deception feel comfortably at home.
</P>
<P>
   To a degree unthinkable for Israel's founding generation, their
country has already become dependent on the United States for
matters as diverse and vital as defense and finance. And it
 &UR; has done so, by and large, cheerfully and wholeheartedly.
</P>
<P>
   Yet whatever material successes they have had, Israelis can
never achieve what so many of them crave _ the benign normalcy that
now characterizes Western societies and the United States above
all. Small wonder that hundreds of thousands have emigrated over
the years, most to the United States, which remains a mythic land
of opportunity and forgetfulness to those who find the cramped
confines of Israel and the tormented destiny of the Jews an
intolerable burden.
</P>
<P>
   The success of Israel _ and the catastrophe of the Holocaust, in
a quite different way _ has understandably overshadowed the miracle
of Jewish survival and creativity over the centuries of the Jews'
dispersion.
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis have dismissed or even despised that experience.
Ironically, however, they find themselves increasingly forced to
wrestle with the questions that agitated the Jews in their
wanderings: Who are we, and what is our mission?
</P>
<P>
   More than for any other state, a spiritual question lies at the
heart of Israel's self-definition and, indeed, its very existence.
Few prosperous peoples, in this age of superficial entertainments
and instant gratification, confront such ultimate questions. As one
that does, the Israelis have every reason to be proud.

PROSECUTOR SAYS CONTAINING HATE CRIMES WILL TAKE EXTRA WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARO ROBBINS  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ A federal law enforcement official said that
authorities must prosecute signs of prejudice among seemingly
mundane assault and vandalism cases to contain hate crimes like the
one in Wyoming in which a gay college student died.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot easier to carry them as an assault than to look
further,'' William Blagg, the U.S. attorney in San Antonio, said
Monday at a seminar on hate crimes sponsored by the Department of
Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of stricter laws against hate crimes point to Laramie,
Wyo., where Matthew Shepard, 21, was found after being beaten and
bound to a fence. He died Oct. 12 and two young men have been
charged with his murder.
</P>
<P>
   The police say robbery was a motive but that Shepard was singled
out because he was gay.
</P>
<P>
   Blagg's prosecutors are handling a civil rights case in El Paso,
Texas, where they've charged two sisters and a husband with holding
a deaf family as indentured servants.
</P>
<P>
   Blagg said his office hasn't handled any cases involving hate
crimes since he assumed control of Texas' Western Division almost
three years ago, a record that isn't necessarily cause for
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because you haven't prosecuted any doesn't mean there
aren't any,'' Blagg said.
</P>
<P>
   No city is immune to outbursts of bias, said Jimmie Jones, a
director of the not-for-profit Facing History and Ourselves in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   His associate, William Johnston, a former deputy police
superintendent in Boston, said every law-enforcement agency needs a
staff member who can recognize the difference between a barroom
brawl involving a white and a black man, and a case involving
racial hatred.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each time we let it go by it escalates,'' Johnston said. ``All
of a sudden someone is tied to a fence.''

IS IT ETHICAL TO LIE ABOUT AGE ON JOB APPLICATION?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE LEWIS 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 1982 film ``Tootsie,'' actor Dustin Hoffman donned a wig
and a dress, assumed a falsetto voice, and plastered enough makeup
on his face to suffocate most women.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman was playing the role of a desperate actor who was so
difficult to get along with that the only way he could get work was
to disguise himself as a woman. The disguise worked. Hoffman, who
played actor Michael Dorsey, did not just get a job. His female
character became the darling of daytime soaps and a cult figure.
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward 16 years to the real-life case of Kimberlee Kramer,
also known as Riley Weston, formerly a top Hollywood writer who did
what some critics are surely calling unthinkable: She lied about
her age, her name, and her life to land a highly coveted position
as a TV writer for the WB network's new hit ``Felicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Kramer's lapse of ethics is not rare. If a 1997 workplace survey
about ethical and moral conduct is any indication, then hundreds of
professional employees are grappling with right and wrong, and some
are failing miserably.
</P>
<P>
   Coauthored by the Ethics Resource Center, in Washington, and the
Society for Human Resource Management in Alexandria, Va., the
survey of 747 human resource professionals found that nearly 50
percent had compromised ethical standards because of financial
pressures or overly aggressive business objectives. Their ethical
lapses ranged from falsification of reports to theft, office
crimes, and outright lying.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer attributed her own actions to her desire for the job, as
well as the creation of a persona she had routinely used to secure
acting roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an accepted practice for actresses to lie about
their age,'' The Wall Street Journal quotes Kramer as saying. ``In
my desperation to find work as an actress I adopted an age
appropriate for my physical appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kramer's make-believe persona, initially created to help her
secure acting roles, continued after her talent and her ``age''
propelled her into a position as a much sought-after script writer.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer is 32 and, by all accounts, quite talented, but in the
tinseled halls of Hollywood a preoccupation with youth forced her
to make a terrible choice. She said she was 19, telling studio
officials she was home-schooled when, in fact, she had graduated
from high school. She said she was single even though she is
divorced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously a problem when women are judged not on the
merits of their work, but by their age,'' says Vivien Labaton,
codirector of the Third Wave Foundation in New York, a national
organization for young women age 15 to 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Age discrimination is endemic to Hollywood,'' adds Labaton.
``This bears itself out in everything from the consistent pairing
of older men and younger women in movies to the sexualization of
young girls in the media. Part of what it means for a woman to be a
hot commodity in Hollywood today is to be young.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, this mindset is not limited to Hollywood, and neither
are ethical lapses and moral indiscretions.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologist Mark Braverman, cofounder of CMG Associates in
Newton, says many of us take on false roles to advance at work or
in society at large.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have to put on masks,'' says Braverman. ``We have to be
the right shape, the right weight, the right color, and the right
age. But what do you get when you succeed in being other than
yourself? Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could take the case of (Kimberlee Kramer) as, perhaps, an
example,'' he continues. ``She was fired not because her work was
not of high quality, but because of the way she had been marketed
and the fact that, without the false persona and age, she
no &UR;  &LR; longer fit the image.''

   SOUTHERN-ITALIAN-COOKING (Undated) _ For generations, southern
Italian cooking in the United States has been reduced to a
red-sauced shadow of its true self. But today, chefs are reaching
for authentic ingredients and preparations, and we are seeing a
cuisine that's as interesting and sophisticated as the one from the
north. By Amanda Hesser.
</P>
<P>
   With recipes.
</P>
<P>
   ITALY-DINING (Undated) _ There is no bad food in Italy. That may
be an exaggeration, but after 3 weeks of traveling through Italy at
the height of the tourist season I have come to believe it is true.
In small towns and big cities, I ate well everywhere. Unlike the
grander cuisines of the world, which rely on the chemistry of
combination and transformation, Italian food is of the earth.
People eat locally and with great simplicity; you find the same
ingredients, prepared in much the same manner, again and again. A
critic's notebook by Ruth Reichl.

Fabricant.

   VEGETABLE-BISCUITS (Undated) _ Baskets full of end-of-season
bounty from the garden left me with a delightful problem: how to
make the most of it? My assistant, Sarah Carey, and I wanted to
make something a little different, and first considered baking
vegetable breads. But then I started to think about biscuits. By

MICROSOFT CASE IS ONE THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ?????  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The case against Microsoft Corp., which began Monday, is a rare
specimen of a fascinating sort of drama. In all the 20th century,
only a handful of times has the government attempted to reach so
deeply into an industry as to change its structure.
</P>
<P>
   The campaigns have been couched in the impersonal language of
industrial organization _ usually the argot of the antitrust laws.
But each time the target has been a system, and usually the person
who designed it.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard Oil case was one such. John D. Rockefeller and his
brilliant business manager C.T. Dodd invented the trust form of
organization in the 1870s, and within a few years they controlled
90 percent of America's oil refining capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Private suits charging monopolization succeeded in busting the
trust, so Rockefeller reorganized his interests as a holding
company. Not until 1911 did the government finally break up
Standard Oil, thus creating the quintessential oligopoly _ an
industry dominated by a few giant corporations, competing with each
other in stately fashion _ but competing.
</P>
<P>
   The one-two punch aimed at the J.P. Morgan banking interests was
another such campaign. It, too, lasted thirty years, and required
special legislation when the Sherman Antitrust Act couldn't be made
to serve.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 curbed Morgan's power as the
lender of last resort among American bankers by establishing the
system of 12 regional banks owned by their members and the central
bank in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It was followed by the Glass-Steagall Banking Act of 1933, which
established federal deposit insurance _ and, not coincidentally,
broke Moragan's bank in two by decreeing that banking and commerce
should forever after be seperate asctivities.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking the DuPont family's hold on General Motors in 1956 was
a third such campaign. It proceeded on the grounds that, by selling
paint to its automotive subsidiary, the chemical giant enjoyed too
great an advantage over its competitors. Pierre S. DuPont, who had
bought control of GM, died in 1954. The leaderless family agreed to
divestiture _ in exchange for a generous tax break.
</P>
<P>
   The decision provided some discipline for conglomerates during
the merger movement of the 1950s and 1960s. Various dodges were
permitted to shelter corporate earnings _ the acquisition of
insurance companies, in particular _ but never again was vertical
integration attempted on such a giant scale.
</P>
<P>
   Two quite different cases marked the 1970s, against IBM Corp.,
the computer collosus, and American Telephone and Telegraph, a
highly regulated monopoly which was known as the Bell System.
</P>
<P>
   The cases culminated on the same remarkable day in 1982, when
the Justice Department withdrew its complaint against IBM, but
through a consent decree forced the telephone system to agree to be
broken up into competitive operating companies.
</P>
<P>
   A powerful telecommunications revolution has run its course in
the 15 years since, vindicating the government's mistrust of the
orderly system that had been devised in the 1880s to spread
telephone service across the nation. Concentration again has been
increasing rapidly among the providers of telephone service _ but
only after a binge of competition has changed the technology
practically beyond recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Not even in the IBM case can the government be said to have
failed to achieve its purpose. The relentless badgering by the
Antitrust Division and a sympathetic judge for 13 years made the
company nervous as a cat about violatiung the law. The result was
that it contracted out for the operating system for its new
personal computer _ and signed a licensing agreement that has since
made Bill Gates the richest man in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of the Microsoft case is whether Gates has used his
enormous market power to muscle in on the new businesses of others,
buying them out or competing them out of business, thus shutting
off potential avenues of innovation. The case will almost certainly
be decided by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   But the outcome is a foregone conclusion. These are cases the
government cannot afford to lose.

NEA CHIEF UPBEAT ON ARTS FUNDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By R.M. CAMPBELL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the past several years, the National Endowment for the Arts
has been teetering on the brink of execution, surrounded by
enemies, deserted by friends.
</P>
<P>
   Those dark days are over, William Ivey, the agency's new
chairman, emphatically declared in a phone interview from his
office in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every conversation I've had with members of Congress,'' he
said, ``has been very positive. This is a new beginning. Votes held
on appropriation measures in both the House and Senate have been
very lopsided in favor of the NEA. We have the basis to move
forward with a budget increase for next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Ivey said he could not release any details until 1999,
he added he anticipated some small changes in the allocation
process to ensure that everyone has access to the endowment.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the endowment's budget was slashed to 1977
levels, just below $100 million. Last fall, the House voted no
money for the endowment, although ultimately, with the Senate
behind the measure, $98 million was appropriated. This summer, the
House voted 253-173 to retain the current level of financing next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for this quantum change in the political
environment, Ivey said, are several.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is strong and the budget is balanced. Supporters
of the NEA are better organized, a result of the national effort to
save the agency. It is is strong and well-organized with a staff
that is mean and lean. We have changed the way we do business.
Also, the politics of anger against the NEA haven't held up and
don't seem to be playing so well. The bipartisan center has
reasserted itself. Slade Gorton is a great example of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican senator from Washington, at one time no friend to
the endowment, played a key role, as chairman of the Senate
interior appropriations subcommittee, in saving the NEA.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few months into his chairmanship, Ivey is part of the
Washington political establishment. Even some of the agency's most
vigorous opponents are shaking his hand happily. His nomination was
unanimously confirmed in late May.
</P>
<P>
   Some have speculated part of the enthusiasm in Washington
political circles for Ivey stems from his non-Eastern, non-high art
background. Born and reared in Michigan, Ivey was educated at the
University of Michigan and Indiana University. He has degrees in
history, folklore and ethnomusicology. From 1971-1998, he was
director of the Country Music Foundation in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps. One never knows. I'll turn it around. My background
in country music and folklore, my work for a real arts organization
in Middle America, preserving and studying a form of grassroots
American music, does have some appeal to members of Congress. Every
conversation I had during my confirmation indicated that my
background was seen as positive. There was concern the endowment
paid too much attention to big arts organizations with a focus on
fine arts and that it not expend 15 percent of its budget in any
one state (that is, New York), which never happened anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivey has no question his some 27 years in Nashville help prepare
him to run the endowment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the first NEA chairman who had run a not-for-profit arts
organization, which has given me valuable experience of moving
forward and shaping a future in a complex economic environment.
</P>
<P>
   Ivey also has a long history of involvement with the endowment,
having chaired or served on 15 different grant panels and acted as
a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``My work at the foundation gave me a rare opportunity to learn
more about the power of one part of America's cultural spectrum,
which is good starting point for an examination of America's
cultural heritage. One of its great strengths is the process of
cross-fertilization. This sense of accommodation and borrowing, one
tradition to the next, to create new art forms is one of the great
energizing aspects of art in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Cultural diversity is a principal theme of Ivey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honoring our diverse traditions must be a given. We have to
look for value in each tradition. The key thing in looking at
America's cultural life is the way in which different art forms
from different sources live side by side. In our democracy, there
is the ideal that no matter where you are from, whether you are
rich or poor, your cultural heritage has standing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivey is very much a part of the new intellectual fashion that
holds all arts are equal, that Beethoven and the Beatles posssess
the same value to society.
</P>
<P>
   ``In each art form there runs the gamut from schlock to
excellence, but all art forms themselves are of equal value. The
NEA has to line up all the great cultural traditions on our shores
to see what is best in each tradition. It is the great challenge in
a democracy to nurture not one single culture but all of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the luxury of blowing anyone off.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivey does not like the terms ``high'' art or ``low'' art because
they are pejorative by nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our language about culture is inadequate. Art is a
marginalized term. People say art is for someone else. It is too
easy for people to use those words and talk past one another.''
</P>
<P>
   The big challenge for the endowment in the future, he said, is
to make the case for a permanent commitment to American culture in
the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was much too easy for the agency to get defined in terms of
what it did instead of what it represented for society. A problem
with a grant would be converted in weeks into a discussion about
the very existence of the agency. There must the commitment to
debate issues without threatening the larger commitment. The arts
strengthen our society. They are the internal defense agency that
keeps our cultural heritage alive. If I could leave the endowment
with that kind of image in the federal government, I would be
happy.''

   ROME _ Like shipping rice to China, coals to Newcastle, steel to
Pittsburgh .... Viagra to Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Viagra in Italy?
</P>
<P>
   What use could there be for the little blue ``love pill'' in a
country renowned for its romantic ardor and sexual prowess?
</P>
<P>
   This is the land that bred the likes of Casanova, Marcello
Mastroianni and Alberto Tomba. Trying to sell Italians on the need
for Viagra must be like trying to convince them to drive slower.
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute, just below the front-page story in my Rome
newspaper about Viagra's October debut is this headline: ``Drivers
Urged To Slow Down.''
</P>
<P>
   In the country that gave us the Lamborghini and the Maserati, a
new public-service campaign wants motorists to ease off the pedal.
</P>
<P>
   Check the plane tickets, did I land in the right country?
</P>
<P>
   I did. Here's the News Flash: Italians are not great lovers, at
least not ALL of them. And they may like to drive their sleek
sports cars like the wind, but speed kills them, just as it does
Americans in their Fords and Chevys.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the facts get in the way of long-cherished
stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   With no one else to hold accountable, I blame the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the coalition of countries has brought stability to the
continent, eliminating the grave worries of earlier this century --
things like the march of fascism and world wars.
</P>
<P>
   But the EU also is serving to homogenize Europe -- creating
uniform standards, open borders and, in the near future, common
banknotes and coins. Brussels is to Europe what Washington is to
America, telling them how they should live and what's good for them
and not.
</P>
<P>
   Before you know it, Italy becomes less Italian, needing the help
of modern science to make love and driving Ferraris at a
school-zone crawl.
</P>
<P>
   Next, they'll tell us that the French no longer find Jerry Lewis
funny.
</P>
<P>
   Yet images die hard and Italians have an abiding taste for the
good life, and not necessarily what's good for them.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey showed that only 20 percent of Italian motorists
regularly buckle up a decade after the mandatory seat-belt law was
introduced. One entrepreneur has made a small fortune manufacturing
white t-shirts printed with a black stripe running diagonally,
meeting one that runs horizontally at the bottom -- to fool police
into thinking the belt is buckled.
</P>
<P>
   Such evidence suggests that Italian motorists will not be
slowing down anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Viagra, never underestimate the power of sexual
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Health authorities say there are some five million impotent
Italians who could use the drug. But they fear there are millions
more who simply may want it as a hedge against performance anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the pressure on Italian men, who have an entire national
identity to uphold.
</P>
<P>
   A public opinion poll earlier this year found -- to the
disappointment of the Italian food company which commissioned it --
that female tourists from Europe and the United States cite hopes
of ``passion'' as their number one reason for visiting the country.
Enjoying the pasta and chianti were second place.
</P>
<P>
   Maurizio Alicico's pharmacy in downtown Rome has been flooded
with calls from men who mistakenly think the pill is an
aphrodisiac.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being Italians, they feel very macho. The sexual persona they
feel very much,'' Alicico says of the callers he has turned away.
``It is clear Viagra will have higher sales in Italy because of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   So, the myth lives.
</P>
<P>
   Italy also remains firmly Italian in other arenas.
</P>
<P>
   The country resolutely lacks anything resembling a consensus on
how the place should be run. In Rome this week, they are trying to
form a new coalition government after the last one fell earlier in
the month.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 56th change of leadership since World War II, and
actually prompted some political pundits in Rome to express concern
that Italy's European partners will not take them seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Come on, Italy should be Italy, the European Union be damned.
With 40 different political parties, serial governments have become
a way of life and yet another icon of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Corriere della Sera commented: ``Heaven only knows
what new political concoction will be dreamed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, Roma ... that's more like it.

NEED TO CUT COSTS HAVING WIDE EFFECT ON MEDICARE SERVICES
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ At first glance, the recent misfortunes of Sheryl
Williams, Mary Enos, Rita Blanter, and Jeffrey Otten seem to have
little in common.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 50, is an emergency room nurse who has lost her job.
</P>
<P>
   Enos, 87, a retired textile worker, is wondering how she will
pay for her medications come Jan. 1, when her insurance company
plans to slap limits on prescription drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Blanter is coping with a 30 percent cut in the money she has to
care for her home health care agency's 200 patients.
</P>
<P>
   And Otten, a hospital president, must figure out how to take $10
million out of his budget over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   But their woes have roots in the same place, the federal
Balanced Budget Act of 1997. The law was designed to eventually
eliminate the federal deficit &UR;  &LR; and includes provisions &UR;  &LR; to cut
wasteful spending and ensure the financial viability of the federal
Medicare program for the elderly and disabled. The act cut
projected Medicare spending by $112 billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Little more than a year later, it is wreaking havoc in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals are laying off workers. Home health agencies are
shutting down, paring back services, or turning away patients. And
Medicare health maintenance organizations are reducing benefits for
seniors or pulling out of the state altogether. All say they are
coping with lower-than-expected Medicare reimbursements, a direct
result of the budget act.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is telling us how difficult it is to cut expenditures for
a program like Medicare,'' said Stuart Altman, professor of
national health policy at the Heller Graduate School at Brandeis
University. ``Critics can blithely talk about waste, but one
person's waste can be another person's vital organs.''
</P>
<P>
   The complex 1,000-plus page act has yielded some unexpected and
unpleasant consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a stealth attack on the Medicare program,'' said
Michael Miller of Health Care For All, a consumer advocacy group in
Boston. ``It flew under the radar screen and only now are we
beginning to wake up to the fact that something radical has
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, federal law did more than just cut projected
spending. It also established funds to subsidize state efforts to
provide health insurance for children. And it gave teaching
hospitals direct access to millions of dollars in teaching and
research money.
</P>
<P>
   But overall the law has caused hardship on the state's health
care providers, seniors, and disabled citizens, leaving many
scrambling to adjust.
</P>
<P>
   Rita Blanter is doing what she can to adjust to a 30 percent cut
in reimbursement from Medicare to her agency, Jewish Family &AMP;
Children's Services in Boston, where she is the director of senior
services.
</P>
<P>
   Blanter is haunted by a decision she was forced to make in
August when another agency asked whether she could take on a young
woman crippled by multiple sclerosis. The woman, who did not want
to be identified, needed help getting up in the morning, eating,
bathing, and dressing. She also needed a nurse twice a day to
change the dressing on her wounds and give her medication, as well
as physical therapy three times a week. The cost of her care
exceeded $2,000 a week, but the agency was reimbursed just $4,000 a
year from Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   It was an untenable situation, and one Blanter thought her
agency could not take on. So the woman has moved into a nursing
home. It was a traumatic change for a woman who once practiced law
and has intact her full mental abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we're living with,'' Blanter said. ``I get goose
bumps thinking about her, but I can't afford to take her. It would
be financially irresponsible to our other patients.''
</P>
<P>
   While Jewish Family has been forced to cut services and turn
down patients, other agencies have simply ceased to offer home
health care. These include the Assabet Valley Home Health Agency
Inc. in Marlborough and Easter Seals of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Though Medicare cut reimbursement of home health care
nationwide, the effects in Massachusetts are particularly severe,
said Patricia Kelleher of the Home Health Care Association of
Massachusetts. That's because Medicare reduced reimbursement across
the board, so states like Massachusetts that have kept costs low
were told to cut further, while states with inflated home health
costs had more room to trim.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Massachusetts agencies received $111 million less in
1998 than in 1997. To soften the blow, Congress this week agreed to
restore $1.6 billion of the projected $16 billion in reimbursement
cuts nationwide for home health care. It also agreed to delay a
further 15 percent cut scheduled to take place Oct. 1, 1999, to
2000.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs are also getting squeezed. Aetna US Healthcare has said it
will pull out of Massachusetts and five other states on Jan. 1. The
company cited reduced Medicare payments among its reasons. The move
will force 58,000 seniors _ 17,000 in Massachusetts _ to find
another HMO.
</P>
<P>
   One of those seniors is Edward Hoffman, 88, in Hyannis. Because
he just switched from Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts
to Aetna in January, the prospect of having to change yet again
frightens him. ``To be told in September to go elsewhere was just
too much,'' said Hoffman's daughter and caretaker, Lois Boemer.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman recently switched to Secure Horizons, which is sold by
Tufts Health Plan of Waltham. But come Jan. 1, he and more than
200,000 other seniors in the state may &UR;  &LR; have to cope with yet
another change, courtesy of the Balanced Budget Act.
</P>
<P>
   Several HMOs in the state, including Secure Horizons, have said
they will limit prescription drug benefits, despite a 1994 state
law requiring HMOs to offer unlimited drug coverage for seniors.
Massachusetts is the only state mandating such unlimited coverage.
HMOs argue that the budget act exempts them from the state mandate.
As a result, seniors could lose &UR;  &LR; their unlimited drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday, Senator Edward M. Kennedy was trying to insert
language in the national budget in a last-minute attempt to
preserve the state mandate. Also, state officials are suing to
force HMOs to continue to offer unlimited drug coverage. The case
is pending in federal court in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mary Enos of New Bedford is already trying to figure
out how she will make ends meet if she must pay part of her drug
bills on her tiny $8,000 annual income. Enos takes eight
medications to treat multiple ailments, from glaucoma to heart
disease. ``It's going to make it difficult for everyone, not just
me,'' Enos said.
</P>
<P>
   Not far away in Stoughton, Sheryl Williams is feeling a
different kind of hurt, one resulting from the loss of her job as
an emergency room nurse at Carney Hospital. Her job is among 56
positions being eliminated at the Dorchester hospital. Again, the
budget act is to blame; Carney cited a $4 million cutback in
projected Medicare reimbursements in 1999 as its principal reason
for the layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not angry at the hospital,'' said Williams. ``They're just
doing what they have to do. But it's unsettling that this is what
health care has come to.''
</P>
<P>
   Carney isn't the only hospital cutting staff. In recent months,
St. Vincent Hospital in Worcester, St. Elizabeth's Medical Center,
Southcoast Health System in New Bedford and Fall River, North Adams
Regional Hospital, and Quincy Hospital have announced cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing hospitals and home health care agencies
instituting layoffs to a degree unseen for a few years,'' observed
David Schildmeier, spokesman for the Massachusetts Nurses
Association.
</P>
<P>
   At Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Jeffrey Otten is
struggling to trim $10 million from the next two years' budget
projections. One-quarter of Brigham's patient care revenue comes
from Medicare, far less than the average hospital, which derives 40
percent of revenue from Medicare. Still, the cuts in projected
payments are forcing painful decisions for Otten, the hospital's
president. He has initiated a hiring freeze. The result, he knows,
will mean patients may have to wait longer to get care.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to have some impact on our ability to provide
services at the level people have come to expect,'' Otten said.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Hollander, president of the Massachusetts Hospital
Association, voiced an opinion shared by many who have been
affected by the budget act.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Balanced Budget Act represents the biggest changes in
Medicare since the inception of the program,'' Hollander said.
``But it is a strictly budget-driven document. There's very little
health policy in it. There's no plan for what seniors will need and
how we will pay for it.''

JAMES PHILLIP HOFFA RUNNING HARD FOR TEAMSTERS CHIEF
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NATICK, Mass. _ It is a rain-soaked Sunday morning when James
Phillip Hoffa strides into Amvets Post No. 79, but his undaunted
supporters are out in force, buoyed by a sense of energy and
vindication.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa, son of former Teamsters president Jimmy Hoffa, &UR;  &LR; sprints
up the hall's center aisle, a husky, middle-aged former quarterback
heading for the goal line. ``We'eeere Back!'' he shouts, stopping a
few feet from the stage to slap a fan's hand.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd explodes: ``HOF-FA! HOF-FA! HOF-FA!''
</P>
<P>
   It's October, and Hoffa is on the campaign trail. &UR;  &LR; That's where
he has been ever since a fund-raising scandal invalidated the 1996
re-election of Teamsters president Ron Carey and forced a new
runoff from which Carey was barred.
</P>
<P>
   These are heady times for Hoffa, who lost to Carey in his first
bid for the presidency of the 1.4 million-member International
Brotherhood of Teamsters. With mail ballots set to go out Nov. 2
and a ballot count scheduled to begin Dec. &UR;  &LR; 3, Hoffa and challenger
Thomas W. Leedham, a union official from Oregon who represents
400,000 warehouse workers, are each vying for one of the most
powerful positions in labor.
</P>
<P>
   The 57-year-old Hoffa is running for Teamsters president amid
echoes of his father's controversial past, the taint of the recent
Teamsters election scandal, and fractious internal politics over
the union's future. Critics doubt whether the younger Hoffa, a
Detroit lawyer who didn't come up through the ranks like most union
leaders, has the political savvy and experience to lead in a modern
world where unions are struggling to make a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   It is an election that will not only transform the country's
biggest private sector union, but will likely focus attention on
the success _ or failure _ of the government's lengthy struggle to
reform what has been long regarded as a crime-ridden labor
organization. Hoffa, who was fined for his own fund-raising
irregularities in the 1996 vote, also must allay fears that his
election will return the Teamsters' old guard to power and reverse
the US labor movement's current direction.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Though described as the front-runner, Hoffa is not guaranteed
a victory. ``Right now, there is an existing organization of
reformers in the field that is far broader than many people think,
and that organization is behind Leedham,'' says Nelson
Lichtenstein, a labor historian at the University of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hoffa has quite a few union local officials that are backing
him, and they can deliver their own locals,'' he continues. ``The
question is, `Can they deliver others?'''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa has strong backing from union locals in the Midwest and
has garnered support from such influential Teamsters officials as
Chuck Mack of San Francisco and Carroll Haynes, president of a
23,000-member public service local in New York. And he has
attracted some Carey defectors to his unity slate.
</P>
<P>
   Though relatively unknown, Leedham is expected to draw support
from workers in the food processing and airline industries as well
as United Parcel Service.
</P>
<P>
   Leedham has been endorsed by Teamsters for a Democratic Union,
Carey's dissident reform wing, which says it wants to clean up the
union and increase opportunities for rank-and-file workers. But
Hoffa has the Hoffa name, a significant draw for a union in which
James P. is fondly referred to as ``Jimmy'' and ``Junior.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, James P. Hoffa is firmly entrenched in the
middle &UR;  &LR; class and has never held an elective &UR;  &LR; union office, but the
elder Hoffa's blue collar roots and hard-knuckled climb from
Detroit union boss to president of the biggest and most notorious
union &UR;  &LR; has given his son an unmistakable aura.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he were John Smith, his name would go nowhere,''
acknowledges Teamsters lawyer George Geller, a Hoffa supporter.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Hoffa contends the name and his father's background are
more important to the press than to rank-and-file Teamsters. ``It's
not about the name,'' he insists. ``People want something new. They
want their union back.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa may have a point. In the Amvets hall, Teamsters dressed in
jeans and jackets with the union's logo say they want higher wages
and a stronger union. They've been battered by deregulation and the
trucking industry's increasing reliance on nonunion drivers.
They're angry about Carey's fund-raising scandal &UR;  &LR; and they think
their union is sinking fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy Hoffa isn't running on his father's name,'' says Ralph
Tobey, a Springfield trucker and a card-carrying member of the
Teamsters since 1962. ``He's running on getting the Teamsters back
to where it used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds 52-year-old Dick Fredette of Local 257 in East Providence:
``We're tired of lousy contracts and givebacks.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Members join a union because they want financial security,''
Hoffa says in an interview. ``They want to retire with dignity and
with an outstanding pension.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also an underlying theme in his campaign: Us vs. Them;
blue collar vs. liberal elite. That theme dominates interviews with
Hoffa and his supporters, who clearly resent the union's liberal
reformers, or so-called new guard.
</P>
<P>
   John Murphy, the South Boston Teamsters official who dug
up &UR;  &LR; information that unraveled the Carey administration and forced
him to step down, refers to the liberals and reformers who backed
Carey as ``a cabal of the eastern liberal establishment.''
</P>
<P>
   That Teamsters reform movement helped Carey win a first term in
1991. He then won narrowly over Hoffa two years ago, but the
results were thrown out _ and Carey was barred from running in this
year's repeat electon _ after evidence emerged that nearly $1
million in union funds were diverted &UR;  &LR; to the Carey campaign. The
scandal dealt a blow to the union's reform movement, and Carey was
expelled from the union in July.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Hoffa is disdainful of Carey and the
reformers. ``They are liars. Their unholy alliance with the corrupt
Ron Carey is coming to an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carey divided us into two camps: old guard vs. new guard. He
created a hatred among brothers and sisters. My plan is to end the
civil war and pull the union together.''
</P>
<P>
   But when asked to spell out his plans to revamp the union, Hoffa
is vague. He promises to increase the union's bankrupt treasury
without hiking dues, and then shies away from revealing where the
money would come from. He is reluctant to give details, he says,
because his detractors might try to undermine or steal his ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have a new and innovative idea for raising $3 &UR;  &LR; million
to $5 million per year without a dues increase,'' says Hoffa.
``After I win, I'll disclose how we plan to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa also promises to rebuild the union's lobbying fund and
develop ``an innovative and aggressive interaction'' with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   If elected, Hoffa adds, he will ask Congress and, if necessary,
the president, to boot the federal government out of the union's
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1989 consent settlement of racketeering charges, the
federal government agreed to monitor the union's elections to rid
it of corruption and mob ties. Under the settlement, an Independent
Review Board was set up in 1992 and charged with ongoing oversight
of the union.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa's pledge to rid the union of the feds appeals to many
rank-and-file Teamsters. Some think Carey's reforms widened
divisions within the union. Others, who lost money and power under
Carey, &UR;  &LR; object to federal oversight.
</P>
<P>
   Notes Dane Passo, the 45-year-old leader of Hoffa's campaign in
Chicago: ``We should be running our union, not the government.
Right now, our membership sees us being eaten up. We don't have
power anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Passo controlled Local 705, a powerhouse local with 18,000
members and a pension fund valued at just under $1 billion, until
he lost to a reformer earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the Amvets hall, Boston Globe driver Tim Dunn of Local
259 auctions off two vintage Life magazines sporting black and
white cover photos of James Riddle Hoffa. Evoking memories of the
Teamsters' glory days, Dunn sells the two for $125 and quickly
contributes the money to the Hoffa campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he feels about the attention the Hoffa name brings,
Hoffa shrugs: ``My father was a great man. He did a lot for this
union. People haven't forgotten that, and they shouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   At 57, James P. Hoffa is hardly a carbon copy of his father.
James, the younger, received a bachelor's degree in economics from
Michigan State University in 1963. His father's education ended in
the ninth grade, but he rose from a rank-and-file Teamster to union
president who helped build what was then the world's largest labor
union.
</P>
<P>
   The year his son entered the University of Michigan Law School
in 1964, the elder Hoffa was convicted on jury-tampering and
mail-fraud charges. After losing a string of appeals, he began
serving a prison sentence at Lewisburg Prison in 1967 _ the year
his son began working as an aide to members of the Michigan State
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Flamboyant and hard-driving, the elder Hoffa admitted having
dealings with the mob and reportedly stated that a labor leader
could not just stand by and allow his enemies to use the mob
against him. The junior Hoffa has denied any connections with
organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Hoffa has been criticized for participating in the
1970s in &UR;  &LR; a limited partnership that invested in a real estate deal
along with Allen Dorfman, the son of a leading mobster. Hoffa says
he ended his participation &UR;  &LR; as soon as he became aware of Dorfman's
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fixation on Dorfman, who died 16 years ago, is an attempt
to tie Hoffa to the controversial past of the union,'' says Geller,
the Teamsters lawyer. ``Yet the essence of Hoffa's connection with
Dorfman was that they were both passive investors in a real estate
investment trust. They did not work with each other; they didn't
cooperate with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask him about his youth, and Jimmy Hoffa will tell you that
union rallies and union halls were an integral part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the weekends, and he worked almost every weekend, my father
would take me down to the union hall,'' recalls Hoffa. ``We'd go
for family rides and, invariably, we would end up at the picket
line and I'd be standing near a fire barrel with men on strike. I
basically grew up at union halls.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa attended public school in Detroit, and then went on to
Michigan State, where he played football until, according to a New
York Times Magazine article, his father demanded he give it up to
concentrate on his studies.
</P>
<P>
   Critics charge Hoffa is not a real Teamster. Sensitive to the
charge, Hoffa points to legal clinics he ran at union halls and a
union trucking job he held one summer in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being president (of the Teamsters) was always in the back of
my mind,'' Hoffa says, minutes before taking the stage at the
Amvets hall. ``That's because I really love this union.''

BRAIN DISEASE MAY SPUR CREATIVITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ People with a form of dementia that attacks the
front parts of the brain sometimes exhibit surges of creativity
that often seem to come out of nowhere, a study released Tuesday
shows.
</P>
<P>
   A stockbroker traded in his conservative attire for vivid
fabrics and started painting precise, detailed pictures. A
53-year-old car stereo installer was fired and began painting
scenes from his New Mexico childhood. A housewife began to withdraw
socially at the same time she took up art, making realistic copies
of famous pictures and rural scenes from her past.
</P>
<P>
   Even as a degenerative brain disease began to rob them of their
ability to speak, understand words or enjoy social contact, each
turned intensely to the visual arts, in some cases creating
award-winning canvases.
</P>
<P>
   Their stories and similar ones are told by a researcher at the
University of California at San Francisco and his colleagues in
Tuesday's edition of the Journal of Neurology.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bruce L. Miller has been studying people with frontotemporal
dementia and found that some of his patients experienced sudden
creativity.
</P>
<P>
   In those cases, the left, or more logical, side of the brain was
more affected. And the front part of the temporal lobes, which are
involved in social behavior, also suffered more damage than rear
portions. The frontal lobes, which control complex thought and
planning, were also relatively untouched.
</P>
<P>
   His work suggests that the more social aspects of ourselves may
inhibit creativity.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think about it, we usually do turn off our social
brain and do creative things in solitude,'' Miller said. ``Maybe
these individuals, in a more permanent way, turned off their social
brain.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a hypothesis that jibes with anecdotal evidence about some
highly creative people.
</P>
<P>
   The troubled painter Vincent van Gogh was thought to have a form
of epilepsy that attacked the temporal lobe of the brain. The
composer Maurice Ravel also may have had a form of the brain
disease. He died while doctors tried to infuse air into the left
side of the brain, which had atrophied.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, researchers have noted that some forms of injury to
the brain cause people to lose their capacity for imagination.
Still, the links between creativity and brain circuitry are poorly
understood.
</P>
<P>
   Frontotemporal dementia, he said, is believed to affect as many
as 100,000 to 200,000 people _ about 10 percent of all dementia
cases.
</P>
<P>
   It tends to strike people in their 50s and is believed to have a
strong genetic component. Researchers have identified a gene
mutation that is thought to be at work in some cases linked to
family inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   Only a fraction of the people with the disease exhibit the
creative surge that Miller described. And not everyone who had more
left-side and frontal temporal lobe damage became creative. He said
it could be that the disease, rather than causing creativity,
unlocks talents and inclinations long-hidden.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who has been working on the disease for 10 years, first
noticed the link to creativity when the son of one of his patients
told him that his father was drawing, and that his drawings had
improved as other signs of his dementia increased. Miller asked to
see copies and was impressed with the man's talent. One of his
pictures won an art award.
</P>
<P>
   ``In neurology, we never seem to focus on the strengths of our
patients,'' Miller said. ``Now, I ask in a more systematic way
about strengths as well as weaknesses.''
</P>
<P>
   A few of Miller's patients also have demonstrated other
late-in-life creative talents, including one man with no musical
background who began composing quartets. Another received a patent
on a chemical detector.
</P>
<P>
   Some had demonstrated artistic talent earlier in their lives,
and it persisted even as the dementia claimed their social and
thinking skills. In people with Alzheimer's disease, which attacks
the brain more uniformly, creative skills decline along with
memory, thinking and language.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's so striking is that it begins to wrest from us our
notions about how the brain works,'' said Dan Geschwind, a
neurologist at the University of California at Los Angeles who
works on the genetics of the disease and previously has
collaborated with Miller. ``Who would imagine you'd improve in some
areas while your brain is degenerating?''
</P>

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the latest study, Miller focused on five people with visual
talents, the most common form of creativity he has seen. Most had
never demonstrated prior interest in art.
</P>
<P>
   Besides loosening social conventions, the disease could be
eating away at part of the brain that inhibits visual information.
Images from the retina feed into the brain from the rear, an area
that is less damaged by this type of dementia.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said it was difficult or impossible to talk to his
patients about the changes they were going through. They usually
can't speak well or at all, and most lack self-awareness, another
characteristic of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   He also thinks many people who are chalked up as eccentric or
suffering Alzheimer's disease actually have frontotemporal
dementia.

CLINTON NAMES PODESTA AS NEW CHIEF OF STAFF 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Tuesday named John Podesta to
replace Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles who leaves the White House
next week after two years in one of Washington's toughest jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Bowles' departure is another sign of the staff turnover that
usually marks a president's second term, but one that comes at a
critical period with Clinton facing an impeachment inquiry by the
House Judiciary Committee next month for lying and covering up an
extramarital affair.
</P>
<P>
   Podesta, currently Bowles' deputy, also is the chief staff
member coordinating Clinton's defense of impeachment allegations
before the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``As many of you know, he and his family have a taste for riding
roller coasters. That will certainly serve him well here,'' Clinton
said during a sunny Rose Garden ceremony to introduce Podesta.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is brilliant. He has a tough hide, a dry wit, a lot of
patience in dealing with the president, hard-won wisdom and a
genuine compassion for improving this nation,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Bowles, a North Carolina businessman, helped broker the 1997
balanced budget agreement that ended decades of red ink and, most
recently, negotiated the budget deal that is allowing Congress to
adjourn this week. Bowles will return to his home state where he is
expected to run for governor in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called Bowles a ``gifted manager and an inspiring
leader, the world's best negotiator and a great personal friend.''
Podesta will be Clinton's fourth chief of staff in six years.
</P>
<P>
   Also leaving in recent weeks was Rahm Emanuel, Clinton's senior
policy adviser, who will return to his hometown of Chicago. In the
running to replace Emanuel is Houston native and longtime aide Paul
Begala.
</P>
<P>
   Mike McCurry, Clinton's press secretary, left earlier this month
and was replaced by Joe Lockhart. &QL;

 &HT;    POLL BACKS DELAYING BABY BELLS' ENTRY INTO LONG-DISTANCE MARKETS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARY BETH REGAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nearly two-thirds of telecommunications experts say
regulators are on the right track by denying regional telephone
companies access to long-distance markets unless they do more to
open local markets, according to a survey released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan survey, conducted by the Democratic-affiliated
Peter D. Hart Research Associates and the Republican-affiliated
Tarrance Group, was sponsored by the Washington-based Small
Business Survival Committee, a non-profit group representing 48,000
companies, including small telecom firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been question and confusion about why there's still no
choice at the local level,'' said Karen Kerrigan, president of
Small Business Survival. ``From this survey, we see most people
think we're headed in the right direction, but it's going to take
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-one percent of respondents to the poll agreed with the
Federal Communications Commission's recent decisions to turn down
local phone companies' applications to move into long-distance
because they hadn't done enough to open their own markets.
</P>
<P>
   While 68 percent of respondents ranked implementing the 1996
Telecommunications Act to encourage competition in local phone
service as extremely important, only 36 percent said amending the
act to make it easier for local ``Baby Bell'' companies to move
into long-distance service was important.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very comfortable with this act, and they don't want
to open it up again,'' Hart said. ``But they realize it's going to
take time to implement.''
</P>
<P>
   David Bolger, vice president of communications for the United
States Telephone Association, criticized the survey for being too
selective.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've found that there is competition at the local level, and
the regional Bells are opening their markets to competition,'' he
said. ``The problem is that there are some serious flaws with this
act.''
</P>
<P>
   Other key findings of the poll include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Sixty percent of respondents said the Telecommunications Act
provides the right framework for introducing competition.
</P>
<P>
   _ Only 10 percent of the opinion leaders said they believed
local phone companies would be allowed into long-distance this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The polling firms interviewed 250 top telecom experts, including
congressional staff members, state legislators and regional telecom
experts, between Sept. 23 and Oct. 1.

   IRELAND-HUME _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ About 15 years ago, John
Hume _ who last week won the Nobel Peace Prize _ built a little
stone cottage on a spit of land overlooking the River Foyle in
Donegal, just a few miles over the Northern Ireland border. The
chances of his being assassinated were somewhat diminished on this
remote and windswept promontory. Hume liked to sit in his yard and
watch ships ply the Foyle on their way to and from Derry. He smoked
too many cigarettes while he stared out to sea. I sat with him in
his yard a few times. He told me more than once that this was the
last bit of Ireland seen by emigrants as they sailed to America and
Canada. How sad, he would say, that after almost everybody was
driven out of Ireland, those few who remained took to killing each
other. (Reid, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

competition is an extension of the transformation that swept
Congress in the early 1990s, when Republicans gained control of
most of the Congressional delegations in the South. The off year
elections unfold in the shadow of the 2000 census, making
statehouse races _ and the 36 governors' races _ especially

without the bickering reminiscent of the old-time, name-calling
contests that years ago were an election-year staple in Texas, both
campaigns concede that voters would probably have paid far less
attention to who will be the state's 27th land commissioner, a job
created 161 years ago when Texas was still a republic. Here's a
look at the two men who want the job. (Ward, Austin

 &HT;    POLL BACKS DELAYING BABY BELLS' ENTRY INTO LONG-DISTANCE MARKETS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARY BETH REGAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nearly two-thirds of telecommunications experts say
regulators are on the right track by denying regional telephone
companies access to long-distance markets unless they do more to
open local markets, according to a survey released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The bipartisan survey, conducted by the Democratic-affiliated
Peter D. Hart Research Associates and the Republican-affiliated
Tarrance Group, was sponsored by the Washington-based Small
Business Survival Committee, a non-profit group representing 48,000
companies, including small telecom firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been question and confusion about why there's still no
choice at the local level,'' said Karen Kerrigan, president of
Small Business Survival. ``From this survey, we see most people
think we're headed in the right direction, but it's going to take
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-one percent of respondents to the poll agreed with the
Federal Communications Commission's recent decisions to turn down
local phone companies' applications to move into long-distance
because they hadn't done enough to open their own markets.
</P>
<P>
   While 68 percent of respondents ranked implementing the 1996
Telecommunications Act to encourage competition in local phone
service as extremely important, only 36 percent said amending the
act to make it easier for local ``Baby Bell'' companies to move
into long-distance service was important.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very comfortable with this act, and they don't want
to open it up again,'' Hart said. ``But they realize it's going to
take time to implement.''
</P>
<P>
   David Bolger, vice president of communications for the United
States Telephone Association, criticized the survey for being too
selective.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've found that there is competition at the local level, and
the regional Bells are opening their markets to competition,'' he
said. ``The problem is that there are some serious flaws with this
act.''
</P>
<P>
   Other key findings of the poll include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Sixty percent of respondents said the Telecommunications Act
provides the right framework for introducing competition.
</P>
<P>
   _ Only 10 percent of the opinion leaders said they believed
local phone companies would be allowed into long-distance this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The polling firms interviewed 250 top telecom experts, including
congressional staff members, state legislators and regional telecom
experts, between Sept. 23 and Oct. 1.

CREATING BISCUITS FROM A GARDEN BOUNTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BARBARA KAFKA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baskets full of end-of-season bounty from the garden left me
with a delightful problem: how to make the most of it? My
assistant, Sarah Carey, and I wanted to make something a little
different, and first considered baking vegetable breads. But then I
started to think about biscuits.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the sweet-potato biscuits that have long been a
tradition in the American South, I had never really eaten vegetable
biscuits or seen recipes for them, so I began to get excited about
creating new ones.
</P>
<P>
   A few of our experiments failed, and we had to play around with
temperature, with the proportion and kind of fat, and with the
timings. We finally came upon techniques that work (and that are
easy for anyone to follow) and that result in beautiful, delicious
biscuits.
</P>
<P>
   We made beautiful ruby red beet biscuits, bright green sweet pea
biscuits and for a special treat, banana biscuits. I don't expect
anybody to make all of these biscuits at once, but the array of
colors is smashing, and arranged together on a platter they would
make a spectacular addition to a buffet.
</P>
<P>
   With any of these, a bit of leftover puree can be creamed with a
little butter and some seasonings and spread on the hot split
biscuits. All would be good with chowders and vegetable soups.
</P>
<P>
   The beet biscuits are slightly denser than the other two, and do
not rise as high.
</P>
<P>
   With the pea biscuits, using frozen peas works just fine. The
banana biscuits, when made in the smaller, two-inch-diameter size,
would be good served with curries or with the chicken and peanut
butter soup that is popular at Kwaanza celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   In the larger three-and-one-quarter-inch size, they make a
lovely base for a banana short cake; split the biscuits and slather
them with a combination of sliced bananas and whipped cream.
</P>
<P>
   Now for our baking tips: In the recipes here, pureed vegetables
or fruit serve to partially replace the flour and the liquid in
regular biscuit recipes. As these semi- or non-starchy purees have
no gluten, the stretchy protein that develops when dough is
kneaded, it is better to use all-purpose flour, which develops more
gluten, than the softer cake flour normally used for biscuits.
</P>
<P>
   Although expert bakers _ or seasoned biscuits makers _ might be
able to whip these up effortlessly to achieve a flaky result, those
of us who are less practiced should keep in mind that it is
important to keep the butter cold by working quickly; after adding
the butter to the flour, place it in the freezer for 10 to 15
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   And once the dough and vegetable puree are combined, the dough
should be kneaded lightly on a flour-dusted surface. The kneading
wakes up the gluten. The dough should be patted out rather than
rolled, as one might have to add too much flour to roll it, making
the biscuits heavy and cakey.
</P>
<P>
   The dough can be patted out and cut ahead of time, then
refrigerated until just before baking. If the biscuits are
refrigerated, especially if they are baked on a cold tray, they
will take slightly longer.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional baking pans are shiny and reflect a lot of heat at
the bottom of the biscuit, which can easily over-brown.
Alternatives are black pans or the air-cushioned sheets often
recommended for cookies, which result in more even baking.

 Turning Around Sybase _ CEO Found Strategy Through Golf   By Jamie Beckett 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
When John Chen joined Sybase as president a little more than a year
ago, he had a mystery to solve: How could a company with loyal
customers and a billion dollars in sales fail to make a profit?
<P>
   Chen, now chief executive of the ailing database software-maker,
found the answer in one of his chief passions: golf. Sybase was
like a player on a difficult course who used the same club no
matter what hole or hazard he faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you play a round of golf with one club, you don't really
maximize your chances of success,'' said Chen, who has hit the
links with the likes of Arnold Palmer and Chi Chi Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   The result: a string of money-losing quarters and a plunging
stock price. Sybase shares, which traded as high as $54 a share in
early 1995, closed Monday at $6.25, up 63 cents, &UR;  &LR; before the
company announced third-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   After five consecutive quarterly losses and a break-even second
quarter, the Emeryville company posted a $2.2 million (3 cents a
share) profit for the three months ended September 30. That
reverses a third-quarter loss of $6 million (8 cents) the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected a break-even quarter, according to IBES
International. It was the second-straight quarter that the company
beat analysts' earnings estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues climbed nearly 10 percent to $233 million from $210.3
million.
</P>
<P>
   Chen said the improved third quarter is a sign of better things
to come as he works to pull Sybase out of its three-year losing
streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very encouraged at everything we've done. We made money,
and we generated cash. I'd like to see revenues go up faster, but I
think we achieved what we set out to do,'' said Chen, who jets to
Singapore today to open a new development center intended to build
business in that market.
</P>
<P>
   Sybase once was a leader in the market for database software _
software used to keep track of things like hotel reservations and
financial transactions. The company has been struggling to recover
from a strategic stumble in the mid-1990s, at the same time the
database industry has been mired in a slump.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, 43, took over as CEO from Mitchell Kertzman last month
after the two had shared the job for about seven months. Chen's
first move was to create a division to make and sell database
software for laptops and other portable computers.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the company's businesses, which include selling
electronic-commerce software and consulting, will operate as a
single division, Chen said, which he hopes will provide the
flexibility and accountability the firm needs to succeed. In the
past, Sybase ran these disparate businesses as one _ selling costly
corporate databases the same way it was selling small, portable
databases, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
   Software for mobile and so-called embedded computers _ computing
devices that help run cars, cellular telephones, pagers and small
appliances _ has been Sybase's fastest-growing business, though
Chen declined to disclose sales figures. He's counting on the new &LR; 
 &LR; unit to jump start revenue growth and raise the company's profile
on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Wall Street isn't convinced. Mobile databases, which
sell for $25 to $100 apiece, won't bring in enough revenue to turn
Sybase around, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems difficult for a company to make its fortune selling
databases that run on machines powered by AA batteries, which is
what Sybase seems to be focused on these days,'' said Merv Adrian,
database analyst at Giga Group, a research and consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Tholemeier, who follows the database industry for First
Albany (and is one of the few analysts with a ``buy'' on Sybase
stock) said he believes that the strategy is all wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of going after niche markets, Tholemeier thinks that the
company should focus on existing corporate customers, selling them
consulting services, software tools and other products.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock is going to stay low as long as these guys aren't
making a profit,'' he said. ``The company needs to make money and
support the existing universe (of customers). All these other
agendas are not going to pay off.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen said analysts aren't seeing the whole picture, but he won't
reveal any more of his strategic plan until December, when he plans
to meet with analysts in New York, San Francisco and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Chen agrees that keeping customers happy is
important _ and he said he's doing that by working with developers
to boost the number of applications that run on Sybase databases.
More than 350 developers have built applications for the company's
mobile database, up 30 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the company added Web-based customer service
and it opened a technology center near Wall Street where its
financial-services customers and software developers can work
jointly on new applications.
</P>
<P>
   Chen hasn't played the role of turnaround artist before, but he
has proven that he knows how to rise to the top. He surged from
executive vice president to chief operating officer at Pyramid
Technology, a Unix workstation vendor, in 1993 and later negotiated
the sale of the company to Seimens Nixdorf Group, a German
high-tech giant.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to running Pyramid as a Seimens Nixdorf subsidiary,
Chen rose through the ranks to become a member of the German parent
firm's board.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, golf provided the link to Sybase _ he heard
about the job during a round with his Blackhawk neighbor, John
Acosta, Sybase's chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   A Hong Kong native, Chen came to the United States at age 16 to
attend high school because a teacher had told him it would give him
a better chance of getting into an Ivy League college. (He later
attended Brown University.) Chen was one of three Asian students at
his 1,200-student preparatory school. His English was only so-so.
Ignorant about U.S. holidays, he failed to make Thanksgiving plans
one year and spent the weekend in an unheated dorm, dining on
vending-machine food.
</P>
<P>
   But he succeeded, he said, because he had ``never learned to be
afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   He's applied that same determination to the formidable task of
guiding Sybase's recovery. Chen said he had other offers after
Siemens Pyramid but chose struggling Sybase because he likes to fix
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gravitated toward Sybase because it's very complicated and
very big,'' Chen said. ``I like to solve problems.''

THREE PARTS MAKE A WHOLE SOUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I always love it when I can apply a simple formula to a broad
range of dishes. And it seldom works as well as it does with creamy
vegetable soups.
</P>
<P>
   The soups have three basic ingredients, and their proportions
form a pyramid: three parts liquid, two parts vegetable, one part
dairy.
</P>
<P>
   The pyramid's foundation is chicken stock (you can substitute
vegetable stock or water, but the result will be somewhat less
substantial).
</P>
<P>
   The middle section is any vegetable, or combination of
vegetables, that will puree nicely and produce good body and
flavor. The peak is cream, milk, yogurt or sour cream. To make four
servings, the pyramid works out to three cups stock, two cups
vegetables and one cup dairy: six cups is the perfect amount of
soup for four people. Aromatic vegetables, like onions, carrots,
and celery, count as part of the vegetable portion, but seasonings
like salt, pepper, herbs, spices, garlic or shallots are
additional, and pretty much to taste.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure is nearly as straightforward as the formula:
Simmer the vegetables in the stock until they're quite tender.
Puree in a blender, in batches if necessary (make sure the blender
lid is on securely to avoid being scalded).
</P>
<P>
   Stir or blend in the dairy and seasonings, and reheat gently
(especially gently if you're using yogurt, which will curdle if it
boils). It's worth noting that these soups are also good cold.
</P>
<P>
   There are shortcuts. Leftover cooked vegetables are super
candidates for this soup. Rinse off any remnants of sauce with hot
water; then combine with stock, and puree.
</P>
<P>
   If you think ahead, you can intentionally cook extra vegetables
for just this purpose. Some vegetables, like winter squash, are so
dense that they create their own creaminess, reducing the amount of
dairy needed.
</P>
<P>
   But these are matters of judgment, perhaps best left until after
you've experimented within the basic rules. Keep the proportions in
line. If there are too many vegetables, your blender won't be able
to puree the mixture; too much liquid will cut the flavor of the
vegetable and thin the soup, too much dairy will reduce the
intensity of flavor and make it too rich.
</P>
<P>
   Always cook the vegetables until very tender, but no more than
that. Spinach is tender in a couple of minutes; potatoes, even cut
into chunks, will require 15. Almost nothing will take longer than
that. Cover the pot while the vegetables cook to prevent too much
of the stock from evaporating.
</P>
<P>
   Seasonings that require cooking, like onion, should be added
with the vegetables. But those that do not, like herbs and spices,
are best added before reheating the mixture so they retain their
freshness.
</P>
<P>
   And there's obviously a difference in the amount of richness
added to the soup by cream, sour cream, yogurt or milk. So, stir in
the dairy element gradually by hand after pureeing, and adjust the
consistency as you like.
</P>
<P>
   CREAMY BROCCOLI SOUP &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   2 cups broccoli florets and peeled stems cut into chunks
</P>
<P>
   3 cups chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   1 clove garlic, peeled and cut in half
</P>
<P>
   1 cup milk, cream or yogurt
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.
</P>
<P>
   1. Combine the broccoli and the stock in a saucepan. Simmer,
covered, until the broccoli is tender, about 10 minutes. During the
last minute or so of cooking, add the garlic (this cooks the garlic
just enough to remove its raw taste).
</P>
<P>
   2. Puree in a blender, in batches if necessary, until very
smooth. Stir in the milk, cream or yogurt, and reheat gently; do
not boil. Season to taste and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   The possible combinations for this kind of soup border on the
infinite. Here are some suggestions for different vegetables to
simmer in the stock:
</P>
<P>
   _ Potato and onion. Use 1 cup each potato and onion (or leek).
Omit the garlic, and garnish with parsley, dill or chives.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spinach. Start with 10 to 16 ounces of leaves (remove thick
stems). Cook quickly, adding a clove of garlic if you like.
</P>
<P>
   _ Turnip and parsnip or turnip and potato. Cook with a small
onion and 1 teaspoon of fresh thyme leaves (or { teaspoon dried
thyme).
</P>
<P>
   _ Carrot. Nice with a pinch of cayenne pepper and a teaspoon or
more of minced ginger, added, like the garlic, during the last
minute of cooking.
</P>
<P>
   _ Celery or fennel. Cook 3 or 4 cloves of garlic along with the
vegetable.

   Or maybe it's simpler. Maybe you just find your fingers
anxiously making typing movements when you're away from your

</P>
<P>
   If any of this is true, it may be that you're addicted to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Some people find themselves sneaking online in the middle of the
night or calling in sick so they can stay home and surf the Net,
says Jim Landers, a counselor with Family Service in Fort Worth.
Still, they don't recognize that what has gotten hold of them is a
computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get called mostly for relationship problems,'' Landers
says. ``They don't come in for help with an Internet addiction, but
when they call for help with a relationship problem, we sometimes
find an addiction to the Internet behind it. I've talked with men
who say they spend 10 hours a day on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet addiction is a psychological dependence on the Internet
or compulsive computer use to the point that it causes family and
relationship problems, job loss, physical exhaustion or failure in
school.
</P>
<P>
   With more people gaining access to the Internet daily,
increasing numbers of people are becoming involved with strangers
they ``meet'' in chat rooms, sometimes throwing away the lives they
have for a fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, people are simply becoming so mesmerized by the
Internet that they are neglecting other areas of their lives, such
as their families or jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kimberly Young, assistant professor of psychology at the
University of Pittsburgh at Bradford, Pa., and director of the
Center for Online Addiction, presents workshops to train counselors
to deal with Internet addicts. Her book, ``Caught in the Net''
(John Wiley &AMP; Sons, $22.95), offers information on how to recognize
signs of Internet addiction and strategies for recovery. (Addicts
note: Young can be reached through her Web site
www.netaddiction.com.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Use of the Internet can definitely disrupt one's academic,
social, financial and occupational life,'' Young says.
</P>
<P>
   Although Internet Addiction Disorder is not yet listed in the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, counselors
say it is often linked with other addictions, especially sex, work
and gambling addictions.
</P>
<P>
   Young conducted an online survey that found that, in well over
half the cases, Internet junkies suffered from prior addictions.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, says Landers, what we call an Internet
addiction is really a sexual addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty to ninety percent of the time it's a sexual addiction.
The Internet amplifies the problem. You can act out your fantasies
and not have to deal with the shame you would feel otherwise
because no one knows who you are. You do things you wouldn't do
otherwise. There are no checks and balances,'' Landers says.
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy relationships are easy, he says. You think, ``I've found
my soul mate.'' The problem is that you've really just found a
superficial connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can look up someone to meet online with the exact
inclinations and quirks you are looking for _ but you might be
getting a woman who is really a man or something else you don't
bargain for and are not expecting,'' Landers warns.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people say they are addicted to the Net, it's not to
their computer or the information highway itself, but to some way
they can use it for satisfaction they are not finding elsewhere,''
the counselor says. ``Usually there are relationship problems they
are not dealing with.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, some people who say they recognize their addiction
turn back to the Net for solutions, a measure critics liken to
Alcoholics Anonymous groups meeting at a bar.
</P>
<P>
   Online support groups, such as Webaholics and Interneters
Anonymous, say they'll help Net surfers who want to overcome their
addictions to cybersex or information overload. Virtual clinics
promise assistance for those who need immediate help.
</P>
<P>
   Critics warn that these kinds of computer-centered resources may
simply gratify the same need for undemanding, unrealistic
connections that are the basis of many Internet-born relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Landers cautions that one danger of the Web is that people who
don't make friends well in person may suddenly start to feel
falsely connected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is about connections,'' he admits. ``But most of
the problems I see are about disconnections.''

FORT WORTH'S AMON CARTER MUSEUM TO BE REBUILT TO EXAND SPACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANET TYSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Most of Fort Worth's Amon Carter Museum will
be replaced by a new structure that will triple exhibition space
and will more dramatically showcase the Carter's superb collection
of American art, museum President Ruth Carter Stevenson announced
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal must be approved by the museum's board of trustees
at its meeting next month.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, only the original 1961 memorial to business
leader and newspaper publisher Amon G. Carter Sr., with its
commanding plaza and view of the downtown skyline, would remain.
</P>
<P>
   The new building _ approximately 107,000 square feet with 27,000
square feet of gallery space _ has been designed by New York
architect Philip Johnson, working with partner Alan Ritchie.
Johnson also designed the 1961 structure and both additions, which
include a total of about 9,000 square feet of gallery space.
</P>
<P>
   Museum officials haven't estimated the cost. Plans for
fund-raising and groundbreaking, and a completion date probably
won't be determined until trustees meet again in April.
</P>
<P>
   Originally designed to house Amon Carter's collection of
artworks by Frederic Remington and Charles Russell, the Carter
almost immediately began evolving into a museum of American art,
spanning the mid-19th century to the present.
</P>
<P>
   The collection includes iconic paintings by Georgia O'Keeffe,
Thomas Eakins and Stuart Davis, as well as an internationally known
photography collection and important prints, drawings and modernist
sculptures.
</P>
<P>
   The Carter's announcement comes at a time when officials of the
neighboring Modern Art Museum are refining plans for a new
building, scheduled for completion in 2002. Also, the Kimbell Art
Museum is awaiting arrival of its new director, Timothy Potts, who
is expected to develop a master plan for that museum's expansion on
adjacent property in the Cultural District.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, completion of all three projects would result in a
sequence of museum buildings in a parklike setting west of downtown
Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson made her announcement to family, friends and museum
patrons gathered Monday night at the Carter for a celebration of
her 75th birthday. She characterized Johnson's plan as a birthday
gift.
</P>
<P>
   Stevenson has been president of the museum since it opened and
has been instrumental in its development. Johnson, too, has a long
history with the Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started out to be a small museum,'' Stevenson said. ``My
brother Amon and I thought it would be Dad's best memorial. But
somehow the collection began to grow, and we became a museum of
American art.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's obvious that this is what we need, and we're lucky to
have the man who started it around to finish it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad always used to say, `Let him dig the potatoes who planted
'em, cause he knows where they're at,'' she said during an earlier
interview, with a mischievous glance at Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he conceived the 1961 building as a monument to
Amon Carter, not as a great art center. The new building will
finally give the Carter the exhibition space it has so long needed,
including 5,330 square feet of galleries for special exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   Galleries with strictly controlled light levels will be devoted
to works on paper and photography. Only the George Eastman House in
Rochester, N.Y., and the Museum of Modern Art in New York have as
much space for displaying photographs.
</P>
<P>
   A new auditorium, lab space for a paper conservation program, a
new library and bookstore, and cold storage for photographs will
also be housed in the new structure.
</P>
<P>
   As for the 1961 building, its ground floor will be devoted to
Amon Carter's collection of Remington and Russell paintings,
bronzes and sketches; the mezzanine galleries will house the
museum's collection of art of the American West. The museum
carpenter shop and book storage were moved off-site a couple of
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Plans to expand the museum were first discussed in 1992-93,
during Jan Keene Muhlert's tenure as director. The idea then was
simply to add modest pockets of space without significantly
altering the structure.
</P>
<P>
   But when Rick Stewart was appointed director in 1995, he
proposed that space requirements be researched and analyzed. After
two years of study, a new architectural program was forwarded to
Johnson. In April, Johnson proposed that the addition be clad in a
dark stone that would set off the 1961 building.
</P>
<P>
   From demolition to inauguration, the project would take almost
two years. Stewart said he didn't know whether the 1961 structure
would have to be closed during construction. If so, he said: ``We
will talk with the board in November about how we can maintain some
sort of exhibition presence. We don't want to just go away for 24
months.''

   Will they return? The Alien Supremes at last year's Fantasy Fest
in Key West. The fun begins Oct. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a haunting thought: If you're after some frightening
times, Massachusetts is the place to be. And we're only noting a
few of the haunted happenings in the Bay State. But just in case
you're looking for more ghosts and witches, we've found a few
elsewhere.

   Home to the spirits of Halloween is Salem on Boston's North
Shore, which earned its reputation in 1692, when the town was rife
with witch hysteria. Hundreds of people were accused by friends and
family of practicing witchcraft, and several were killed for their
alleged crime.
</P>
<P>
   Salem offers Haunted Happenings, a three-week celebration of the
ancient tradition in which the town is transformed into a veritable
hotbed of horror. The happenings include a Monster Bash, a costumed
dog show, haunted houses, the Hall of Illusions, and more. On
Halloween there's a festival of food, dancing, and shopping. For
Haunted Happenings information, call 800-298-2929. Salem is home to
the Witch Dungeon Museum, the Salem Wax Museum of Witches and
Seafarers, and the Salem Witch Museum, which are all open all year.

   In Berlin, there's Spooky World (508-838-0200), which is known

   Historic Deerfield's annual Supernatural Sunday celebration
takes place in the 300-year-old Western Massachusetts village on
Oct. 25. This is a family event highlighting the myths, legends,

   What happened? Kate Morgan had checked into Room 3502 of the
Hotel del Coronado in Coronado, Calif., to meet with her estranged
husband. But he never showed, and several days later Kate's body
was found on the hotel steps. That occurred in 1892, yet today
people who stay in Room 3502 sometimes report odd noises, spirited
breezes, strange faces, and the ghostly figure of a young woman in
a black dress. Kate, perhaps, is still waiting for her husband.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just one example of people from the past refusing to
leave one of the Historic Hotels of America, a collection of more
than 125 historically significant lodging places. Halloween is
approaching, so let's tell some more tales:
</P>
<P>
   _When studying in Europe in the 1890s, Thomas Rowe met the love
of his life, a young woman named Lucinda, whom he would meet by a
fountain. But her parents forbade their relationship, and a
downcast Rowe returned to America. In 1925, he included a replica
of that fountain when he built the Don CeSar Beach Resort and Spa
in St. Petersburg Beach, Fla. And although the fountain no longer
exists, hotel employees still tell of seeing a couple walking hand
in hand into the hotel and suddenly vanishing.
</P>
<P>
   _As a welcome respite from the heat of Washington, D.C., Mary
Todd Lincoln and her children spent two summers at the Equinox in
Manchester Village, Vt. But their plans to return in 1865 were
changed after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Today, hotel
workers report seeing images of a woman and child on the third
floor that are consistent with descriptions of Mary Lincoln and one
of her sons. Are mother and child trying to recapture their
carefree days before the tragedy?
</P>
<P>
   _Guests in one room at Georgia's Jekyll Island Club Hotel
sometimes find that their coffee appears to have been sipped and
their newspaper read. It's the room that was used by Samuel Spenser
when he stayed at the exclusive hunt club, and he would always sip
a cup of coffee while scanning the Wall Street Journal. Maybe he's
still doing so.

<P>
   &UR; Travel Trivia: &LR;  Where will you find the Kalahari Desert?
(Answer at end of column.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In a name: &LR;  You've probably heard of the term ``bumped,'' which
means you've lost your seat on an airplane because of overbooking.
When you lose your hotel room, however, the hotel people say you've
been ``walked.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In a phrase:  &LR; The term ``Seven Wonders of the World'' was
created in the second century BC by tourism companies hoping to
attract customers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Today's fractured English lesson: &LR;  Ad for a hotel in Spain:
``The provision of a large French widow in every room adds to
visitors' comfort.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Quotable: &LR;  ``Never mind the fun in the sun: I want to slouch on
a couch!'' _ William Bendix as a vacationing Chester A. Riley in a
1951 ``Life of Riley'' radio broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Vroom: &LR;  Salt Lake City has more households (37 percent) owning
three or more vehicles than any other US city.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Museum of the month: &LR;  At the newly opened Kellogg's Cereal City
in Battle Creek, Mich., you can create your own box of cereal with
your face on the front, tour a simulated factory production line,
and even meet Captain Kangaroo. After all, who among us hasn't sat
down at the breakfast table with a bowl of cereal, read the back of
the box, and dug in to find the premium! Admission is $6.50 for
adults, $5.50 for seniors, $4.50 for children 3-12, and free for
those 2 and younger. The theme for weekends this month is ``A
Bowlful of Fright.'' For more information, call 616-962-6230.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Snappy slogan: &LR;  One of the lounges at the Mount Washington
Hotel in Bretton Woods, N.H., is called The Cave because of its
narrow entrance and stone walls. But a sign outside advises, ``No
Miners in The Cave (must be 21).''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Advice to go: &LR;  Airlines often have weekly fare specials on the

STEAM-POWERED PADDLEWHEELERS SOON TO APPEAR ALONG ATLANTIC COAST
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A familiar look for new vessels
</P>
<P>
   A new line of coastal ships will include Boston and other New
England ports as a major part of planned itineraries.
</P>
<P>
   The Delta Queen Steamboat Co., America's oldest cruise company
that currently operates authentic, steam-powered paddlewheelers
along waterways in the heartland of America, will soon take another
chapter out of shipping history and replicate coastal ships such as
those of the once-famed Fall River Line that provided service
between Boston and New York. That company was known as ``the only
way to travel'' between 1847 and 1937.
</P>
<P>
   The new vessels will be even grander, more comfortable, and will
be state-of-the-art diesel-driven vessels with period furnishings,
luxurious amenities, and the latest in safety technology. Each of
the planned five coastal ships will accommodate 226 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The 300-foot-long vessels will have 114 staterooms with 101
outside. There will also be two single-occupancy and two
wheelchair-accessible staterooms.
</P>
<P>
   Contracts for the first two vessels are expected to be signed
Nov. 12, said Scott Young, president of the line, at a recent
meeting in Boston. The vessels are expected to cost between $30
million and $35 million each. Launch of the first ship is set for
June 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Young said the company will offer eight-day, seven-night cruises
from Portland to Boston and 10-day, nine-night cruises from Boston
to New York City. Other Eastern ports where the vacations will
begin or end include Halifax, Nova Scotia; Philadelphia; Baltimore;
Washington; Norfolk; Jacksonville; and Miami. Itineraries are also
being developed for the Pacific Northwest and northern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vacations will be heavily destination-oriented, and shore
excursions will bring passengers to some of America's most historic
and beautiful places,'' said Young. The new cruises will
``capitalize on Delta Queen's reputation for showcasing the
history, heritage, and magnificent scenery that abounds across our
country,'' Young added.
</P>
<P>
   The new vessels will join the Delta Queen Steamboat Company's
existing fleet: the National Historic Landmark Delta Queen, the
Mississippi Queen, and the American Queen, the world's largest
steamboat. The paddlewheelers offer three- to 14-night cruises on
10 inland American waterways. These boats are ``enjoying an annual
occupancy of 91 percent, repeat passenger counts of up to 37
percent, and we have successfully absorbed a 74 percent increase in
capacity since the American Queen's launch in 1995,'' said Russel
Varvel, vice president of sales for the line.
</P>
<P>
   A collection of models and memorabilia on the Fall River Line
can be seen at the Marine Museum near Battleship Cove in Fall
River. The museum also has a 28-foot model of the Titanic built for
a 1952 movie. For information, call 508-674-3533.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise catalog
</P>
<P>
   Magellan's, which has been supplying travel needs for vacations
around the world, is now offering a catalog devoted just to cruise
needs. You name it _ suntan, garment bags, seasickness treatments,
and more _ can be found within its pages. Each item comes with a
detailed explanation of the benefits for the cruise traveler. For a
free copy, call 800-962-4943.

   &UR; Learning German in Zurich &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I will be in Zurich in the first half of 1999 and would like
to learn German there. Where can I take German lessons in or near
the city? _ Maryann Schultz, New York, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. Since Switzerland has three official languages _ German,
French and Italian _ it is a great place to improve one's fluency.
So much so that each year, Switzerland Tourism, 608 Fifth Ave., New
York, N.Y. 10020, (212) 757-5944, publishes the booklet ``Language
Courses in Switzerland.'' While the courses it lists are aimed at
teen-agers, there are at least a few schools in Zurich that serve
adults.
</P>
<P>
   The best known is probably Berlitz Language Schools, which has
two branches in Zurich, including one at 7 Seefeldstrasse, 8008
Zurich, (41-1) 261-6807, fax (41-1) 261-9304. Sabina Graf, the
assistant manager there, said the courses are open-ended and
offered from two to five times a week. Price depends on the number
of students: about $13 a lesson for classes of five to eight
students, to about $35 for classes of two students.
</P>
<P>
   You can sign up for classes before leaving the United States.
For details, contact Lorenzo Diaz at the Berlitz office at 40 West
51st St., New York, N.Y. 10020; (212) 765-1001, extension 638.
</P>
<P>
   Another choice might be Klub-schule Migros Zurich, Oerlikon
Center, 305 Hofwiesenstrasse, 8050 Zurich; (41-1) 311-5088, fax
(41-1) 311-5030. This school offers an intensive approach _ four
hours a day for a month _ with sessions starting every month. It
offers courses at 12 levels of fluency. The cost is about $510 a
month. English-speaking students should ask for Jacqueline
Assaintrangir.
</P>
<P>
   A third option is the Alpha Sprachstudio, 10 Stadelhoferstrasse,
8024 Zurich; (41-1) 252-4994, fax (41-1) 262-3706. This school has
been around since 1975 and offers courses on 12 levels, from twice
a week to a half-day daily. Intensive courses start each month.
Prices range from about $515 to $605 a month for daily lessons, or
$25 a night.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Visiting the Canaries &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I would like to go to the Canary Islands with a friend in
February. Are there package deals? And are there tours to learn
about the original inhabitants of the islands? _ Halli Moskowitz,
New York, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. While the Canary Islands are part of Spain and have long been
a popular vacation destination, especially for Europeans, they are
only about 70 miles off the coast of Africa and more than 600 miles
from the Iberian Peninsula. The seven major islands of the Canaries
_ essentially the peaks of an undersea mountain range that in
ancient times were thought to be the remains of Atlantis _ have
been described as having a climate that is perpetual springtime,
with highs mostly in the 70s and the 80s. You can be comfortable at
the beaches at any time, sometimes while gazing at snow-covered
mountain peaks.
</P>
<P>
   There are no direct flights to the Canary Islands from the
United States, according to the Tourist Office of Spain, so the
easiest and most common way to visit the islands is by chartered
tour. Two New York tour operators, Canary Island Tours and Spain
Tours and Beyond, offer identical packages to Tenerife, the largest
island, and say they can put together individualized or standard
side trips to other islands for an extra charge.
</P>
<P>
   The tours from New York to Tenerife are on Air Europa via
Madrid, and offer choices of 12 hotels, from three- to five-star
establishments, in the resort areas on the south side of the island
or on the north coast in Puerto de la Cruz. The fares, $759 to
$1,649 in February, include hotel for five nights, daily buffet
breakfast, transfers, casino entry and a night's stay in Madrid
returning.
</P>
<P>
   Culturally, the islands owe much to both Europe and Africa, with
the influences of Hispanic, Portuguese, French, Italian and Berber
immigrants. But before these people arrived, the Guanches _ tall,
blond cave dwellers of unknown origin _ led a Stone Age existence,
leaving behind cave paintings on the islands of La Palma and El
Hierro, and embalmed bodies. On Gran Canaria Island, experts have
reconstructed a Guanche city, Mundo Aborigen, using life-size
figures.
</P>
<P>
   It is in the Ayaguares National Park about three and a half
miles from from Playa del Ingles Beach. It is open daily 9 a.m. to

   &UR; Washington Millennium &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Six couples would like to celebrate the millennium in
Washington. Can you provide information on events there on and just
before Jan. 1, 2000. _ George N. Havens, Bratenahl, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   A. Hard as it may be to believe, there are a lot of promises
coming out of Washington but few concrete plans for that weekend,
now 432 days away.
</P>
<P>
   There should certainly be a number of events, since 2000 is not
only the end of the millennium but also the 200th anniversary of
the White House, the Capitol, the Library of Congress and of
Washington itself as the nation's capital. But a spokeswoman for
the Washington Convention and Visitors Association says it doesn't
expect to start getting details from businesses or government until
at least December. The association has a Web site, www.washington.
org/, that can help in planning a visit, and offers tourism
information at (202) 789-7069.
</P>
<P>
   Another place to check is the White House Millennium Council,
which will coordinate many activities. Sue Vogelsinger, the
council's spokeswoman, said galas, parades and family events
(including fireworks) on the Mall are planned. The council's Web
site, www.2000.whitehouse.gov, is supposed to list events as they
are announced. You can also call the council at (202) 456-2000.

<P>
   Wall Street's seismic tremors have barely rattled the glassware
in most New York restaurants. The question is whether there will be
aftershocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now business has been great, but I'm expecting to see a
blip,'' said Charles Palmer, the owner of Aureole, echoing the
views of other owners. ``On a couple of the days when the market
went crazy, we had 30 lunch cancellations by 11 a.m.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is putting the glassware away for safekeeping yet, but
despite the market's recent rebound, a mood of caution has settled
over the restaurant business, which has been euphoric for the last
few years.
</P>
<P>
   At Patroon, Ken Aretsky, an owner, expects a turndown early next
year. ``The year-end bonuses will be off dramatically, and we
probably will not be selling $2,500 bottles of wine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Few meals involve a $2,500 bottle of wine, though. So for the
time being, it's business as usual, more or less. While some
experienced restaurateurs have suggested that there may already be
a restaurant glut in the city, New York has so far not seen the
cancellation of major projects, unlike Singapore, where the
construction of a four-story rooftop restaurant was recently
postponed. Openings continue at a steady clip.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Henry Meer opened City Hall, a large, handsome
American-style brasserie in an 1863 cast-iron building in TriBeCa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put computer hookups in one private room, so Wall Street
firms can have meetings,'' he said. ``I don't know how well it will
do, but I'm not worried about the restaurant. People always want to
eat out.''
</P>
<P>
   Restaurateurs predict that the well-known places with a solid
customer base and good food and service will not suffer. And
moderately priced places in areas like the East Village will also
continue to thrive, they say. The niche just below the top, where
prices may be too high for the neighborhood, may suffer, experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler Merson, a chef who has been trying to open a restaurant
with a Wall Street backer since March, has not found any real
estate bargains. ``I offered $300,000 for a place that's on the
market for $400,000, but they still want $375,000,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Caterers are feeling a crunch, though. ``We were supposed to do
an event this month with Morgan Stanley,'' said Diana Barnett, an
owner of the Main Event, a catering company. ``They have put it on
hold for the time being. I'm not calling my Wall Street clients
just now.''
</P>
<P>
   When the stock market crashed in 1987, it took more than a year
for restaurants to feel the effects. Value became the buzzword.
Aurora struggled and finally perished while customers stood on line
for huge family-style portions at Carmine's.
</P>
<P>
   The prix fixe menu is another way to deliver value to the
customer and the restaurant. ``You can be sure that if the slide
continues, they'll be putting in prix fixe menus as of Jan. 2,''
said Clark Wolf, a restaurant consultant.
</P>
<P>
   The Four Seasons is not waiting. It has already changed its
dinner menu in the Grill Room, from a la carte, with main dishes
from $38 to $47, to a prix fixe menu, at $59.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the closest monitoring of the situation is being done by
people whose companies depend on restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, D'Artagnan, the Newark supplier of foie gras, lost
$60,000 and nearly closed because of uncollected bills, said Ariane
Daguin, an owner. And now? ``We're anxious, and we're monitoring
the situation but there is not one sign of a problem yet,'' she
said. ``The jitters are in people's minds, not in the reservation
books.'' &QL;

`DEALS OF THE CENTURY' IN FLIGHTS TO ASIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Oct. 25) 
(JT) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Asia's economic woes have hit that region's airlines
particularly hard, and many are slashing fares in a desperate
attempt to attract passengers. For example, the regular full coach
fare between New York and Seoul, South Korea, this time of year is
about $2,500 round trip, while full coach fare between Newark and
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, is about $3,600. But bargain hunters can
fly from New York to Seoul on Korean Air from $749, including five
nights in a hotel, or between Newark and Kuala Lumpur for $739 on
Malaysia Airlines, including four hotel nights.
</P>
<P>
   While Australia has been spared most of Asia's troubles, this is
also a good time to travel to Sydney from Los Angeles or San
Francisco. Qantas has a package starting at $1,098, including five
nights' accommodations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There are fabulous bargains out there for travelers to Asia,''
said Michael Boult, an international air travel specialist for
Rosenbluth International, a travel management company based in
Philadelphia. ``They're the deals of the century.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because Qantas is financially sound, after a record profit of
$183 million for the fiscal year ending June 30, its package deal
is more in the nature of the occasional fare sale than a fire sale.
But because of their weakened economies and devalued currencies,
Korean Air and to a lesser extent Malaysia Airlines have been
hemorrhaging money, as have China Airlines (Taiwan), All Nippon
Airways and Thai Airways.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Saddled by strikes and more than $2 billion in debt, 57-year-old
Philippine Airlines shut down Sept. 23, ostensibly for good. But a
week later the carrier's employees and management voted to give it
another try, although with a reduced fleet and route system.
International flights have not yet been restored. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While Philippine Airlines had been in the red for years, and
Garuda Indonesia Airlines has had problems since well before Asia's
woes, the more recently weakened carriers have no illusions that
they will strengthen their balance sheets much with rock-bottom
fares. They are mainly trying to buy time while they jettison
unprofitable routes, cancel or delay orders for new planes, shift
to smaller aircraft and forge international alliances.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Qantas and Cathay Pacific recently joined American
Airlines, British Airways and Canadian Airlines to form the
Oneworld Alliance, which is expected to be up and running in
February. Oneworld has also invited Japan Airlines, Iberia and
Finnair. On Jan. 1, Air New Zealand, Ansett International and
Ansett Australia will join the Star Alliance, which includes
United, Lufthansa, Air Canada, Varig, SAS and Thai Airways.
Singapore Airlines is also expected to join the Star Alliance next
year.
</P>
<P>
   While alliances enable passengers to book on any partner airline
and offer convenient connections, they also allow pooling of
frequent-flier miles and extend the reach of each airline partner. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cathay Pacific _ which through the six months ending
June 30 recorded a net operating loss of about $22.6 million, its
first such loss through the midyear in more than 20 years _ will
soon begin pulling back from weaker Asian markets by suspending
service to Sapporo, Japan, and reducing flights to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Qantas is not the only Asian-Pacific airline in the black,
although the Asian economic downturn eroded the profits of Air New
Zealand as well as those of Singapore Airlines, the longtime
favorite in airline passenger polls. Japan Airlines, after
restructuring its unprofitable nonaviation businesses and writing
off large losses, expects to return to profitability this fiscal
year (ending March 31, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   Japan Airlines' wholesale-tour arm, Pacifico Creative Service,
has several packages to Japan for travel through March 31, 1999:
round-trip air fare, airport transfers and five nights in Tokyo
starting at $1,015, departing from New York, Chicago, Los Angeles
or San Francisco; air fare and three nights from $5,050, flying
business class from the above four cities plus Atlanta, including
hotels, and five-night package starting at $1,850 that includes
hotels in Tokyo, Kyoto and Nara.
</P>
<P>
   United States airlines have been bruised by the Asian economic
downturn, but far from battered. Asia constitutes only about 10
percent of their revenues, said Boult, the international air travel
specialist at Rosenbluth International. In fact, the Department of
Transportation reports that the major passenger airlines worldwide
this year have had the best net profit ever for a second quarter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   United Airlines dropped its San Francisco-Manila nonstop in
February, while Northwest has suspended service between Honolulu
and Nagoya, Japan, Minneapolis-St. Paul and Hong Kong, and
Minneapolis-St. Paul and Osaka, Japan.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines has daily nonstops to Tokyo from Chicago,
Dallas-Fort Worth and Seattle, and will begin daily service from
Dallas-Fort Worth to Osaka on Dec. 20. ``Our Tokyo routes remain
profitable,'' said Tim Smith, an American spokesman.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Airline officials estimate that Asia's airline industry will
recover in two to three years. By then traffic is expected to rise
about 5 percent annually rather than the 7 to 8 percent that the
International Air Transport Association forecast only a little more
than a year ago.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, from Bangkok to Bali, there are still bargains galore.
For example, Singapore Airlines and Asian Affair Holidays are
offering a $928 package to Bali through March 31, including
round-trip air fare from the East and West Coasts, plus five nights
at a hotel.

WHY MANY BARS IN TOWN HAVE SCAFFOLDS UP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa.)   (af)  
 By THOMAS VINCIGUERRA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Now that New York is seeing renovation left and
right, with a freshly minted Grand Central Terminal and the
once-derelict Times Square so crowded no one goes there anymore (as
Yogi Berra may or may not have said about Toots Shor's), how about
the island's signature cocktail? What happened to the Manhattan?
How come (italics)it(end italics) has taken so long to get a face
lift?
</P>
<P>
   A bar standard in the 1940s and 1950s, the drink languished for
years, along with most other whisky-based concoctions in a
health-and-hangover-conscious America that favored the gentler
touch of light beer, wine and vodka. But a more alcoholically
robust generation has recently rejected such tentativeness and is
imbibing so-called classic cocktails anew, updated versions of the
Manhattan among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm seeing people in their 20s drink Manhattans,'' said Paul
Pacult, a co-host of ``The Happy Hour,'' a weekly radio show on
WEVD-AM that is the ``Car Talk'' of the drinks world. ``When I'm in
a restaurant and I hear a bar call for a Manhattan specifying what
they want in it, it kind of pricks up your ears.''
</P>
<P>
   A traditional Manhattan consists of rye whisky, sweet vermouth,
bitters and a maraschino cherry. Sometimes called the whisky
martini, it has benefited from the retro chic that has brought
martini bars and their attendant veneer of smartness back into
vogue.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly a Manhattan is its own experience. Whereas a martini
is celebratory and chrome-plated, a Manhattan is nostalgic, like a
black-and-white movie. It is a cocktail noir: sip one long enough
and its rich, dark retrospection will evoke double-breasted suits
and Bakelite telephones with Butterfield 8 exchanges (the Lady in
Red is optional).
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the revival is that the current taste for
single-malt Scotches has spun off into interest in premium
bourbons. And bourbon, being sweeter than Scotch, complements sweet
vermouth.
</P>
<P>
   When Andrea Immer, beverage director of Windows on the World,
created her Greater Manhattan drink for the reopening of the
restaurant, she used bourbon for rye and substituted Harvey's
Bristol Cream sherry for vermouth.
</P>
<P>
   For those few who prefer their Manhattans dry, or ``perfect'' (a
traditional designation meaning that the vermouth portion should be
half sweet and half dry), Lori Montfort, a manager at Alva on East
22nd Street, chose merlot instead of vermouth.
</P>
<P>
   The result _ with one part merlot and three parts Maker's Mark
bourbon plus a dash of bitters _ is both dry and dark, so for a bit
of brightness, Ms. Montfort uses a lemon peel instead of a cherry.
</P>
<P>
   The linchpin of the Manhattan is the bitters, said Gary Regan,
the other host of ``The Happy Hour.'' ``They bring together the
herbal aspects of the vermouth and the forthrightness of the whisky
and point up the best aspects of both.''
</P>
<P>
   David Marsden, the bar manager at City Hall, a new restaurant on
Duane Street in TriBeCa, calls a good Manhattan the test of a good
bartender. ``It should taste like rainwater,'' Marsden said, ``a
silky, soft, very mellow flavor from beginning to end.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, fair is fair. At least two other boroughs have namesake
drinks: the Brooklyn, an obscure combination of rye, dry vermouth,
maraschino and Amer Picon (a kind of bitters) and the somewhat
better-known Bronx, composed of gin, sweet and dry vermouth and
orange juice. But those are frankly also-rans.
</P>
<P>
   For people in many parts of the country for whom New York is a
distant fantasy rather than daily reality, a drink called Manhattan
becomes a kind of totem. Rex Roberts, who now lives in Brooklyn,
grew up in John O'Hara country, Schuylkill County, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   For him, back in the early 70s, partaking of a Manhattan at age
18 was a worldly rite of passage. ``It was the first mixed drink I
ever had,'' he recalled. ``When I bellied up to the bar, I ordered
a Manhattan because I loved the name, and I had always been in love
with the idea of moving to New York. I was awed by the aura of the
city. I drank them for quite some time without knowing what was in
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Legend has it that the Manhattan was first concocted at the
Manhattan Club in 1874. The drink is very much a product of the
Gilded Age, favored by the likes of J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, bartenders made liberal use of vermouth, which
had only recently been imported to America. The sweet or
``Italian'' variety, especially, reflected the tastes of the late
19th century, when sugar syrup was common in cocktails. And in the
Northeast, at any rate, whisky usually meant rye.
</P>
<P>
   But straight rye was a casualty of Prohibition, when it was
overtaken by Canadian spirits smuggled across the border. (Using
Scotch, of course, yields a Rob Roy.)
</P>
<P>
   In postwar America, the Manhattan was known as a women's drink.
``A Manhattan was more palatable than a martini,'' Dale DeGroff,
the beverage director of the Rainbow Room, said. ``It had a
sweetness and a roundness to it _ and a cherry. It was seemly and
proper.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the Manhattan's first heyday, it was usually served on
the rocks and in an old-fashioned glass. The drink now often finds
itself strained into a martini glass to highlight its complex
color. ``If somebody wants ice,'' Marsden of City Hall said, ``I
can tell you it's somebody's mother or grandmother.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen King, wine director of the Union Square Cafe, says she is
``very attached'' to the Manhattan straight up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost a piece of art to me,'' she said. ``It's an
accessory, like a nice pair of earrings _ it looks lovely with the
cherry bouncing around in there and the light shining down on the
glass.''
</P>
<P>
   The secret to fully appreciating a traditional Manhattan, or
today's variations on the theme, is that it should, if possible, be
consumed on the island itself.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the difference? Could it be that rumbling of the
subway underfoot _ or is it those taxi fumes in the air?

   ROME _ Like shipping rice to China, coals to Newcastle, steel to
Pittsburgh .... Viagra to Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Viagra in Italy?
</P>
<P>
   What use could there be for the little blue ``love pill'' in a
country renowned for its romantic ardor and sexual prowess?
</P>
<P>
   This is the land that bred the likes of Casanova, Marcello
Mastroianni and Alberto Tomba. Trying to sell Italians on the need
for Viagra must be like trying to convince them to drive slower.
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute, just below the front-page story in my Rome
newspaper about Viagra's October debut is this headline: ``Drivers
Urged To Slow Down.''
</P>
<P>
   In the country that gave us the Lamborghini and the Maserati, a
new public-service campaign wants motorists to ease off the pedal.
</P>
<P>
   Check the plane tickets, did I land in the right country?
</P>
<P>
   I did. Here's the News Flash: Italians are not great lovers, at
least not ALL of them. And they may like to drive their sleek
sports cars like the wind, but speed kills them, just as it does
Americans in their Fords and Chevys.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the facts get in the way of long-cherished
stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   With no one else to hold accountable, I blame the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the coalition of countries has brought stability to the
continent, eliminating the grave worries of earlier this century --
things like the march of fascism and world wars.
</P>
<P>
   But the EU also is serving to homogenize Europe -- creating
uniform standards, open borders and, in the near future, common
banknotes and coins. Brussels is to Europe what Washington is to
America, telling them how they should live and what's good for them
and not.
</P>
<P>
   Before you know it, Italy becomes less Italian, needing the help
of modern science to make love and driving Ferraris at a
school-zone crawl.
</P>
<P>
   Next, they'll tell us that the French no longer find Jerry Lewis
funny.
</P>
<P>
   Yet images die hard and Italians have an abiding taste for the
good life, and not necessarily what's good for them.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey showed that only 20 percent of Italian motorists
regularly buckle up a decade after the mandatory seat-belt law was
introduced. One entrepreneur has made a small fortune manufacturing
white t-shirts printed with a black stripe running diagonally,
meeting one that runs horizontally at the bottom -- to fool police
into thinking the belt is buckled.
</P>
<P>
   Such evidence suggests that Italian motorists will not be
slowing down anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Viagra, never underestimate the power of sexual
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Health authorities say there are some five million impotent
Italians who could use the drug. But they fear there are millions
more who simply may want it as a hedge against performance anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the pressure on Italian men, who have an entire national
identity to uphold.
</P>
<P>
   A public opinion poll earlier this year found -- to the
disappointment of the Italian food company which commissioned it --
that female tourists from Europe and the United States cite hopes
of ``passion'' as their number one reason for visiting the country.
Enjoying the pasta and chianti were second place.
</P>
<P>
   Maurizio Alicico's pharmacy in downtown Rome has been flooded
with calls from men who mistakenly think the pill is an
aphrodisiac.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being Italians, they feel very macho. The sexual persona they
feel very much,'' Alicico says of the callers he has turned away.
``It is clear Viagra will have higher sales in Italy because of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   So, the myth lives.
</P>
<P>
   Italy also remains firmly Italian in other arenas.
</P>
<P>
   The country resolutely lacks anything resembling a consensus on
how the place should be run. In Rome this week, they are trying to
form a new coalition government after the last one fell earlier in
the month.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 56th change of leadership since World War II, and
actually prompted some political pundits in Rome to express concern
that Italy's European partners will not take them seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Come on, Italy should be Italy, the European Union be damned.
With 40 different political parties, serial governments have become
a way of life and yet another icon of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Corriere della Sera commented: ``Heaven only knows
what new political concoction will be dreamed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, Roma ... that's more like it.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. HELENA, Calif. _ Very early one day recently, when the pale
sun was still burning the last wisps of fog off the vines, a red
van rolled to a stop at the Grace Family Vineyards winery near
here. No one was about. Out jumped a slim woman in black slacks and
an assortment of jackets meant to ward off the morning chill.
</P>
<P>
   In vats on the concrete apron before her were fourtons of
crushed grapes, Grace Family's entire 1998 harvest. Pushing up a
sleeve, she thrust her arm deep into the red mush. Fermentation had
begun. And Heidi Barrett had started her day.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barrett may be California's best-known maker of wines hardly
anyone will ever drink. She is part of a special breed of
California winemaker: she owns no winery and grows no grapes.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, hers are among the highest-priced wines in the world,
most of them so rare that they never see the inside of a liquor
store or a restaurant; they are snapped up by connoisseurs and
collectors who do not flinch at paying $100 and up for a bottle and
who vye for places on the (very short) waiting lists of steady
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barrett is a consulting enologist, which means she makes
wine for other people. All the wineries in her exclusive group are
here in the Napa Valley and most of them are very small. Grace
Family Vineyards, often rated the most coveted wine made in
California, will make about 150 cases in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Screaming Eagle Winery produced 500 cases of wine in 1996.
Paradigm, with an annual production of about 3,000 cases, is the
largest of Ms. Barrett's clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say I make about 12,000 cases of wine a year,'' she said,
``equal to what you'd expect from a conventional small winery.''
</P>
<P>
   All her wines bear her imprint: intense richness, dark, almost
opaque color, elegant texture and beautiful balance. The wines
differ from label to label depending on the soil, the sun exposure,
the grape varieties, the vagaries of wine making and aging and, of
course, the whims of her clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try for rich, elegant, balanced wines,'' she said,
``preferably made from hillside grapes. Cabernet is my specialty
but I like to make merlot, zinfandel and sangiovese.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barrett and her cohorts in this special field are
pacesetters; their wines are fashionable and have the cache that
the big wineries had 10 years ago. These winemakers have the
control over their product and freedom of expression that they
might not have if they were as employees of a winery.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barrett, 41, has been around wine all her life. Her father
is Richard Peterson, one of California's best-known winemakers, who
worked variously at Beaulieu Vineyards, the Monterey Vineyard and
Atlas Peak Vineyards. Her husband is Bo Barrett, winemaker and
general manager at Chateau Montelena in Calistoga.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really never thought about any other world,'' she said. She
studied enology at the University of California at Davis from 1975
to 1980, taking several quarters off to ``work the crush,'' that
is, partake in the harvest in Germany and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   After school she worked for Justin Meyer at Franciscan
Vineyards, then at Rutherford Hill and Bouchaine. In 1983 she went
to Buehler Vineyards, where they made her the winemaker even though
she was only 25.
</P>
<P>
   She stayed at Buehler for six years, during which time she met
and married her husband _ at a wine tasting _ and had two
daughters, Remi and Chelsea, now 10 and 12 years old, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left Buehler because I wanted to work part time while the
kids were small,'' Ms. Barrett said. ``For the first couple of
years I had only two or three clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Her business gradually picked up, and clients, like Dalla Valle
Vineyards, a highly respected Napa winery, with whom she worked for
eight years, came and went. In her book, that's OK ``The variety
has always been there and that's what I love,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That variety includes Barbour Vineyards, Jones Family Winery,
Lamborn Family Vineyards, Hartwell Vineyard, Oakford Cellars, and
Vineyard 29. Many of her clients are hobbyists, wealthy
professional people from the San Francisco area who have retired in
the Napa Valley or who come on weekends. They hire part timers like
Ms. Barrett to tend their small vineyards and to make their wines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I confine myself pretty much to the Napa Valley,'' she said.
``to a radius of 30 miles from my home.'' The Barretts live near
Chateau Montelena at the northern end of the Valley. ``That way I
can drop the kids off at school and sometimes pick them up in the
afternoon,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Because most of her projects are so small, she can make several
in the same place. For example, Vineyard 29 and Barbour Vineyards
wines are both made in the Grace Family Vineyard winery just north
of St. Helena.
</P>
<P>
   Others are made at the Napa Wine Co., a medium-size wine making
facility in Oakville, near the Robert Mondavi Winery.
</P>
<P>
   The Napa Wine Co. is what's known as a custom crush facilty.
Winemakers like Ms. Barrett rent the company's winemaking
equipment, using its tanks to ferment their wines and its storage
space to age them.
</P>
<P>
   At this time of year, when the harvest is in progress, as many
as 75 winemakers, many of them among the best -known California
names, make all or part of their wines at the Napa Wine Co.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barrett will not take just anyone as a client. She regularly
turns down offers from winery owners who will give a great deal to
get her to work for them. ``She's really tough,'' said Dick Grace
admiringly. ``She turns down some of these rich business types who
aren't used to being turned down, especially by a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   During harvest time, Ms. Barrett often takes her daughters to
the wineries. ``They love to jump into the vats and punch down the
grapes with their feet,'' she said. ``All their friends are jealous
and plead to be invited to stomp the grapes. Some of them end up
doing cannonball dives into the vats. We just hose them down when
they finish.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, for the first time, she produced wine under her own
label, La Sirena. ``One of my clients had some surplus wine made
from sangiovese grapes, a 250-case lot,'' she said, ``It was
excellent stuff and I hated to see it sold off in bulk.'' She
borrowed $25,000 from a bank, finished the wine, sold it within a
year and paid the money back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an entirely new experience,'' she said. ``I'm a rock
for everyone else, but when it comes to my own wine, I can't even
watch it being bottled _ I feel sick. Is it just what I wanted? Did
I forget to do something? Should I have waited a little longer?
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, as soon as the cork is in, you feel better about
it _ more excited than nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   La Sirena, also made in discouragingly small quantities _ 200
cases of cabernet sauvignon, 300 cases of sangiovese _ has become,
like most of Ms. Barrett's other creations, a sought-after cult
wine.
</P>
<P>
   One of her concerns is the price of the wines she makes. Not
what the wineries get, which is usually around $100 a bottle, but
what the wines trade for after they've been sold _ from $300 a
bottle up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get it,'' Ms. Barrett said. ``I make them to be drunk
and enjoyed. It's rather sad that they go into collections and may
never be opened.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there appears to be a bit, just a bit, of guilty pleasure
in knowing that something you've done is so highly regarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the Screaming Eagle somewhere at $900 a bottle,'' she
said. ``So, for my birthday, I drank one we still had in the
cellar. It helped me get over being 41.''

   ROME _ Like shipping rice to China, coals to Newcastle, steel to
Pittsburgh .... Viagra to Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Viagra in Italy?
</P>
<P>
   What use could there be for the little blue ``love pill'' in a
country renowned for its romantic ardor and sexual prowess?
</P>
<P>
   This is the land that bred the likes of Casanova, Marcello
Mastroianni and Alberto Tomba. Trying to sell Italians on the need
for Viagra must be like trying to convince them to drive slower.
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute, just below the front-page story in my Rome
newspaper about Viagra's October debut is this headline: ``Drivers
Urged To Slow Down.''
</P>
<P>
   In the country that gave us the Lamborghini and the Maserati, a
new public-service campaign wants motorists to ease off the pedal.
</P>
<P>
   Check the plane tickets, did I land in the right country?
</P>
<P>
   I did. Here's the News Flash: Italians are not great lovers, at
least not ALL of them. And they may like to drive their sleek
sports cars like the wind, but speed kills them, just as it does
Americans in their Fords and Chevys.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the facts get in the way of long-cherished
stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   With no one else to hold accountable, I blame the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the coalition of countries has brought stability to the
continent, eliminating the grave worries of earlier this century --
things like the march of fascism and world wars.
</P>
<P>
   But the EU also is serving to homogenize Europe -- creating
uniform standards, open borders and, in the near future, common
banknotes and coins. Brussels is to Europe what Washington is to
America, telling them how they should live and what's good for them
and not.
</P>
<P>
   Before you know it, Italy becomes less Italian, needing the help
of modern science to make love and driving Ferraris at a
school-zone crawl.
</P>
<P>
   Next, they'll tell us that the French no longer find Jerry Lewis
funny.
</P>
<P>
   Yet images die hard and Italians have an abiding taste for the
good life, and not necessarily what's good for them.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey showed that only 20 percent of Italian motorists
regularly buckle up a decade after the mandatory seat-belt law was
introduced. One entrepreneur has made a small fortune manufacturing
white t-shirts printed with a black stripe running diagonally,
meeting one that runs horizontally at the bottom -- to fool police
into thinking the belt is buckled.
</P>
<P>
   Such evidence suggests that Italian motorists will not be
slowing down anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Viagra, never underestimate the power of sexual
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Health authorities say there are some five million impotent
Italians who could use the drug. But they fear there are millions
more who simply may want it as a hedge against performance anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the pressure on Italian men, who have an entire national
identity to uphold.
</P>
<P>
   A public opinion poll earlier this year found -- to the
disappointment of the Italian food company which commissioned it --
that female tourists from Europe and the United States cite hopes
of ``passion'' as their number one reason for visiting the country.
Enjoying the pasta and chianti were second place.
</P>
<P>
   Maurizio Alicico's pharmacy in downtown Rome has been flooded
with calls from men who mistakenly think the pill is an
aphrodisiac.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being Italians, they feel very macho. The sexual persona they
feel very much,'' Alicico says of the callers he has turned away.
``It is clear Viagra will have higher sales in Italy because of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   So, the myth lives.
</P>
<P>
   Italy also remains firmly Italian in other arenas.
</P>
<P>
   The country resolutely lacks anything resembling a consensus on
how the place should be run. In Rome this week, they are trying to
form a new coalition government after the last one fell earlier in
the month.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 56th change of leadership since World War II, and
actually prompted some political pundits in Rome to express concern
that Italy's European partners will not take them seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Come on, Italy should be Italy, the European Union be damned.
With 40 different political parties, serial governments have become
a way of life and yet another icon of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Corriere della Sera commented: ``Heaven only knows
what new political concoction will be dreamed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, Roma ... that's more like it.

GEORGES WAS AN ISLAND HOPPER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., Oct. 25)  
(JT) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For 11 days last month, Hurricane Georges plowed across the
Caribbean, killing at least 500 people and inflicting property
damage estimated at more than $5 billion as it weaved through
nearly a dozen countries before expiring as an early fall rainstorm
over Georgia. It was a disaster _ although not for the entire
region and not necessarily for the tourist industry on which the
area's economy depends.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, damage, though extensive, was selective. Indeed,
the majority of Caribbean islands were not affected at all by the
storm and its winds, which reached a peak of 135 miles an hour.
Georges may have inflicted widespread destruction throughout the
Greater Antilles, but ``most of our 32 member states were
untouched,'' said Jean Holder, secretary general of the Caribbean
Tourism Organization. ``So over all, our position, as usual, is a
good one, and we want the traveling public to be in no doubt as to
that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The entire Windward Islands group of the Eastern Caribbean, for
example, was bypassed by the storm, meaning that visitors thinking
of traveling to Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, the Grenadines,
Martinique, St. Lucia or St. Vincent have no reason to change
plans. Similarly, Trinidad and Tobago, the Dutch islands of Aruba,
Bonaire and Curacao and Margarita Island just off Venezuela were
all outside the hurricane zone. The Bahamas, Cayman Islands,
Jamaica and the Turks and Caicos Islands also were not affected by
Georges.
</P>
<P>
   Even on the larger islands that suffered a direct hit, such as
Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, many important tourist destinations
were spared. Though parts of the southeastern Dominican Republic
were severely damaged, for instance, and will not return to full
normal operations for weeks, all of the hotels, restaurants and
attractions in popular northern-coast towns such as Puerto Plata
are reported to be functioning normally. So, as always, it is
advisable to check with travel agents, hotel chains and national
tourist offices about conditions at specific locales and
properties.
</P>
<P>
   Though hotels were the section of the tourism infrastructure
that proved most vulnerable to Georges' depredations, as is clear
in the country-by-country assessment below, the storm also forced
the closing of several major airports, including the regional hub
in San Juan. But at American Airlines, the principal carrier in the
region, and its affiliate, American Eagle, Caribbean service is
pretty much back to normal, said Al Becker, a company spokesman,
except for La Romana, in the eastern Dominican Republic. There, he
said, regular daily jet flights from Miami are not scheduled to
resume until December, though prop service from San Juan has been
restored.
</P>
<P>
   According to airline and tourism officials, a few other airports
remained available on a limited basis into October because, for
instance, damage to landing towers, radar equipment or runway
lights prevents after-dark landings. Mayaguez, in Puerto Rico, and
St. Croix, in the United States Virgin Islands, fell into that
category, but have now returned to normal operations. In St. Kitts,
where an extensive renovation and expansion of Robert L. Bradshaw
International Airport had been completed just weeks before the
storm struck, restrictions are still in force.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is God's hand,'' Dwyer Astaphan, minister of tourism for
St. Kitts and Nevis, said resignedly early this month. ``We
received damage to the tower and also to our terminal, but
procurement is in process right now, and there is no reason why we
cannot be completely finished with repairs by Dec. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Cruise lines, on the other hand, say they were virtually
unaffected. Many vessels were still on summer routes in the
Mediterranean and Alaska when Georges was ripping through, and will
be returning to the Caribbean only this month. ``The only place we
really ran into problems was Key West,'' said Rich Steck, a
spokesman for Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, ``and since they really
have got their hands full now and are closed to tourism anyway, we
are going to be substituting other destinations, such as Nassau,
until things are under better control there.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, one pier at the harbor in San Juan, which is second
only to South Florida as a home port for cruise ships, suffered
damage, according to officials of the Puerto Rican government. But
that has caused no inconvenience because ``we have enough other
docks to receive cruises'' at the main harbor, said Jorge Davila,
executive director of the Puerto Rico Tourism Co. The damage at
Port Zante in St. Kitts, opened in 1997, was somewhat more serious,
officials there said, but not enough to require cancellation of
cruises.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first cruise ship to come in was on Oct. 8, a Norwegian
Cruise Line Vessel with a capacity of 1,534 passengers,'' Astaphan
said. Those returning vessels are tying up not at Port Zante but at
old piers nearby. ``I am advised they will be replaced within three
to five months,'' he said. ``In the interim, vessels with up to
1,600 passengers can tie up at the old pier, which is where they
tied up previously.''
</P>
<P>
   On islands that bore the brunt of the storm, beaches, tropical
forests, golf courses and nature reserves were also damaged. So
even though hotels in the affected areas may be functioning again,
the landscape may not appear as lush as it normally does, and some
visitors may therefore wish to postpone trips. On the other hand,
tourism authorities on several islands say they may institute
cut-rate packages this winter to lure back reluctant travelers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, damage to fields and crops on several islands means
that some food items may be unavailable at hotels or considerably
more expensive. In the end, then, whether or not to go to the
Caribbean during the coming high season is largely a matter of
individual preference. A survey of the most affected islands
follows, adhering to the same northwesterly course as the
hurricane:

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA _ Most of the destruction in this nation
involved residences: Officials estimate that more than half of all
homes suffered some damage. But at least half of Antigua's 28 main
hotels were also affected. Most are back in business, but the
Caribbean Hotel Association reports that several do not plan to
reopen until December. Among them are the Pineapple Beach Club, the
Inn at English Harbor, Coco Point Lodge, the Galleon Beach Club and
the Hawksbill Beach Resort.
</P>
<P>
   ST. KITTS and NEVIS _ Both of the islands that make up the
smallest country in the Caribbean were struck with considerable
force, which damaged residences and government buildings. ``Every
area was impacted, some more than others,'' Astaphan said.
Government officials estimate that 85 percent of homes suffered
some damage, most of it to roofs, and put preliminary estimates of
repairs at nearly $500 million. On Nevis, the smaller of the pair,
many of the elegant plantation homes that attract upscale visitors
have recovered quickly. But the island's main resort, the Four
Seasons, is not expected to reopen until Dec. 15, due in part to
beach erosion. Nearly half the buildings at the Hurricane Cove
Bungalows are said to have been leveled, but the hotel remains
open.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Fort Thomas Hotel and Jack Tar Village Resort and
Casino on St. Kitts are closed. Officials said the Fort Thomas
probably will not open this season and that the Jack Tar, the
biggest property on the island, is likely to remain closed until
May.
</P>
<P>
   NETHERLANDS ANTILLES _ On St. Maarten, Princess Juliana Airport
remained open throughout the storm, an indication that the island
was pummeled by less than full-force winds. Almost all of the 19
hotels and condominiums are said to have full power, water and
telephone service, although some residential areas were still
without electricity early in October, and the Millennium Beach
Resort and Maho Beach Hotel and Casino are expected to be closed at
least until December.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, tiny St. Eustatius was hard hit by the storm. As a
result, one-sixth of the island's homes lost roofs, residents were
still being advised to boil water as of mid-October, and extensive
damage to natural foliage was reported. Hotels and restaurants,
however, are fully operational.
</P>
<P>
   UNITED STATES VIRGIN ISLANDS _ Early reports of widespread
damage on all three main islands have proved exaggerated. Such
well-known destinations as Caneel Bay on St. John, the Buccaneer on
St. Croix and the Ritz-Carlton on St. Thomas briefly stopped taking
guests and reservations, but returned to normal after a quick
cleanup. Airline service is normal and all attractions are open.
</P>
<P>
   PUERTO RICO _ By official tally, more than $2 billion in damages
was inflicted to property across the island. In the San Juan area,
several hotels suffered significant damage and, according to the
Caribbean Hotel Association, remain closed for repairs, among them
the Condado Plaza, Crowne Plaza, Ramada Hotel Condado and Radisson
Normandie. Farther away, the hotels most seriously affected
appeared to be the Hyatt Dorado Beach, which tourism officials
expect will reopen Nov. 9, and the Hyatt Regency Cerromar, whose
tentative reopening date is Dec. 15.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant problem in the wake of the storm was the
lack of electricity. An extraordinarily high level of preparedness
mitigated some of the havoc caused by Georges on other islands, but
could not prevent damage to power lines and generators. Telephone
service was restored almost immediately; water supplies returned
shortly afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``By Oct. 25, we expect that complete electrical service will
pretty much be restored in metropolitan San Juan,'' said Davila of
the Puerto Rico Tourism Company. But, he added, it may take a
little bit longer in the central mountains, where some paradores,
or inns, are. The luxury Horned Dorset Primavera Hotel, in Rincon,
suffered no structural damage, but was closed until Oct. 8 because
it had no utilities.
</P>
<P>
   DOMINICAN REPUBLIC _ The highest human toll, more than 280 dead
and at least 100,000 homeless according to official estimates, was
inflicted here, and the country remains in a state of shock and
mourning. Also, the government has come under fire for its alleged
lack of preparedness, and the population has complained about slow
restoration of public services, electricity in particular.
</P>
<P>
   The most severe damage to tourist facilities was concentrated in
the east, around La Romana and Punta Cana. The area's best-known
resort, Casa de Campo, is one of several hotels still closed,
though a reopening date of Dec. 20 has been set for ``a limited
inventory'' of the hotel's 300 rooms and 150 villas. The Allegro
Resort Bavaro and the Viva Dominicus expect to be fully operational
by mid-November, but the Casa del Mar is scheduled to remain closed
until Dec. 1, and officials say the Allegro Resort Caribbean
Village Decameron should be able to resume operations by Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   HAITI _ The tourist infrastructure in the Western Hemisphere's
poorest nation is so ramshackle even under ordinary circumstances
that it has been hard to detect Georges' impact. Hotels in
Port-au-Prince, the capital, were suffering frequent power failures
and breakdowns in telephone service in mid-October, a normal state
of affairs there. Georges appears to have done its most severe
damage in the Artibonite Valley, far off the tourist track. Royal
Caribbean canceled at least one cruise to Labadie, on the north
coast, but that was because of reports of civil unrest, not
hurricane damage, said Steck, of Royal Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   CUBA _ It is off-limits to American tourists, but still draws
more than one million visitors a year from other countries.
According to reports from Havana, hotels there were affected only
marginally. Some hotels in northern coastal resorts such as Cayo
Coco, however, reported to have suffered some damage, but have now
reopened.

AN AUTHOR IN SEARCH OF A SETTING

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago her centenary passed unnoticed in literary
circles, and in her swampy backwoods Florida the celebration was
perfunctory at best. But Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings is a permanent
author because she left at least two permanent books. Among her own
sex she may be counted among a dozen or so ``best'' American
authors, but surely less is known about her than of most of the
others. Yet her life was extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Marjorie Kinnan was born in Washington, D.C., on Aug. 8, 1896 _
into, we assume, comfortable circumstances, because her parents
were friendly with President and Mrs. Grover Cleveland. Her father,
for whom she had a strong attachment, was a federal patent
attorney. He died when Marjorie was 17; and ``not his life, but his
character'' has been reflected in many of her fictional creations.
</P>
<P>
   The Kinnans' political persuasion was passionately liberal, and
in 1918 Marjorie graduated with honors at the University of
Wisconsin, traditionally one of the great liberal centers. For an
even decade thereafter she was a newspaper reporter _ in
Louisville, Rochester and elsewhere _ and she married a fellow
journalist. All the while she was writing by moonlight, ever more
frustrated that magazine editors showed no interest in her short
stories.
</P>
<P>
   In 1928 she made a sudden and quite remarkable decision.
Convinced that she had no place or culture of peculiarity to write
about, she determined to take residence in the most backward region
of her country. Believing that to be the rural swampland of
Florida, the Rawlingses ``deliberately cut our civilized ties'' and
moved to ``the most firmly entrenched outpost of the vanishing
frontier.''
</P>
<P>
   This back-to-nature flower child before her time settled herself
in Cross Creek, which she described as ``not quite a community but
almost, and racially equal.'' Nearly within shouting distance were
six other families _ four white and two black. She had found a
terrain and a ``cracker'' society that would sustain her writing
life.
</P>
<P>
   Although their 70 acres of mostly orange grove proved modestly
profitable, Marjorie's husband did not take to the region she
immediately loved. After their divorce she had more freedom to
write, and won a Scribner's contest with a long story titled
``Jacob's Ladder.'' It caught the attention of the great Scribner
editor Maxwell Perkins, already fabled as the publishing catalyst
for Hemingway, Fitzgerald and Thomas Wolfe. But in the reading of
``Editor to Author,'' a collection of Perkins' correspondence with
his prodigies, it's easy to believe that Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings
was the ``discovery'' of whom Perkins was proudest.
</P>
<P>
   Under Perkins' guidance she published the novels ``South Moon
Under'' (1933) and ``Golden Apples'' (1935), giving her adopted
region a literary identity; and in 1938 ``The Yearling'' struck a
chord nationally, led the bestseller chart, and won for Rawlings
the Pulitzer Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years ``The Yearling'' _ the love story of adolescent
Jody Baxter and Flag, his pet fawn _ has accrued status as an
American classic treasured by adults young and old. With her
reputation secured, Rawlings' stories were collected in 1940 as
``When the Whippoorwill,'' and ``Jacob's Ladder'' was issued as a
novelette.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cross Creek'' (1942), Rawlings' often funny valentine to her
adopted backwoods, isn't a novel but reads like one and is a jewel.
Yet it appeared for a time to be her swan song. Having married a
St. Augustine hotelier in 1941, she thereafter divided her time
between the city and her ``scrub.''
</P>
<P>
   But after a long rest, Rawlings consciously mounted a comeback.
In 1953 her novel ``The Sojourner'' was received politely, and she
undertook a biography of Virginia novelist Ellen Glasgow. Alas, in
that same year a cerebral hemorrhage dispatched her, only 57.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings a ripe subject for literary
biography?

   JASPER, Texas _ Four months ago, civic leaders here bristled
when their East Texas town of 8,000 was labeled the ``town that
shamed America'' after the dragging death of a black man named
James Byrd Jr. Officials proudly noted the swift arrest of three
white suspects in the Byrd case, and then reeled off benchmarks of
racial progress in Jasper: a black mayor, two black school
principals, a black chamber of commerce president, and a black
administrator of the town's largest hospital. Great strides, they
said, for a southern town 45 percent African-American and 55
percent white. But in recent weeks, the town has gained a new
perspective on itself, this time from its own residents. By BARRY

MOMENT OF TRUTH: WHAT TO TIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Oct. 25) 
(JT) 
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   How much to tip is an anxiety-provoking question that follows a
traveler from airport to hotel to restaurant, nationally and
internationally. Do you tip a hotel-room housekeeper? How about the
masseuse? The golf pro? A restaurant's captain?
</P>
<P>
   The general manager of the Inn at Union Square in San Francisco,
which has banned tipping, says the ban ranks high on guests' lists
of favorite features. But few have followed this lead. Generally,
tipping is the custom throughout America.
</P>
<P>
   Customs overseas are usually noted in guide books, though the
size of tips may not be specified. In Japan, for example, service
charges are added and there is no tipping at hotels or in taxis,
according to Marian Goldberg, a spokeswoman for the Japan National
Tourist Organization. But she said tour guides in Japan are not
offended by tips.
</P>
<P>
   At the edge of some aspects of American travel, the service
charge added to the tab can be seen working its way in. For
example, it's not uncommon now to see on a menu, ``For parties of
eight or more, a service charge of XX percent will be added to the
total bill.'' The percentage is frequently 15 or 20 percent.
Restaurants want to present one check, not juggle eight, and
getting a hot meal in front of so many people at once is difficult
and individual tips may not cover this extra effort.
</P>
<P>
   Resorts add service charges to bills because otherwise the guest
may envision a battalion of hands held out: bellmen, housekeepers,
waiters, golf pros, bartenders, lifeguards and many others. In
addition, it is difficult to figure out where to keep cash while
lifting weights. On the other hand, when it is clear that a service
is performed by someone who is not a resort employee, there should
be a tip: for a massage, I usually give 10 percent, rounded up, but
the manager of a New York health club said that 15 to 20 percent
was the usual amount there.
</P>
<P>
   There aren't a lot of general guides about tipping. Original
Tipping Page
(www.cis.columbia.edu/homepages/gonzalu/tipping/tipping.html) may
be found on the Web, but its rates strike me as eccentric.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few rules of thumb, with the understanding that some
organizations, like cruise companies, publish guidelines on amounts
and that these should take precedence. But no tip should be
provided when service is discourteous. It is demoralizing to those
providing good service and undermines the idea that tipping is
optional.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Step 1: Plan &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The primary way to avoid tipping anxiety is to be prepared. A
supply of new one-dollar bills should be held at the ready. Really
fussy travelers on long trips carry along smaller envelopes or
notecards and envelopes to meet situations where naked currency
seems awkward, for concierges, for example.
</P>
<P>
   At hotels and motels, according to Katherine Potter, a
spokeswoman for the American Hotel and Motel Association, tips
typically do not rise and fall with the price of the room. Like
most experts in this area, Ms. Potter emphasized that no tip is
ever required, but this nostrum does little to soothe a traveler
who wants to avoid seeming stingy or a fool. I have watched people
suffer for hours after grossly overtipping through error. The
solution is to forget the error; recipients focus on their good
luck, not the scorn of the donor.
</P>
<P>
   The person who cleans the hotel room should get $1 or $2 a guest
for each night, and more if you are messy or have asked for many
extra deliveries. A prompt delivery of an iron and board is worth
$2.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers who go to conventions and meetings in hotels might
want to be sure to tip well because they are identified as
representatives of an organization and want to create good will. If
you get particular help, ask whether the employee will be on duty
the day you leave. If not, tip on the spot. Leaving the tip on the
bathroom counter helps assure it gets to the person who does the
work.
</P>
<P>
   Room service can be a bother. Check the menu first to see if a
service charge will be added. A tip beyond that is not necessary
unless there is something special about the delivery. If no charge
is added, 15 to 20 percent of the bill is fine.
</P>
<P>
   The person who brings up the bags and opens the room for you
should get $1 or $2, unless you have a whole trolley of luggage,
when it should be more. The door attendant who calls a cab should
get $1.
</P>
<P>
   Employees at airports indicate that tips range from $1 to $2 a
bag. Fred Baer, manager of ground transportation for the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey, said that the airlines had
policies that skycaps _ the uniformed porters who are the only
people legally allowed to carry bags at New York airports _ were
not allowed to solicit tips. At Terminal 4 of Kennedy International
Airport, Baer said, a minimum charge of $1 a bag is in effect, and
signs on the skycaps' carts note this.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Some Aren't Tipped &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Economy hotels with no bell staff may have security guards in
the registration area. Anthony Marshall, president and dean of the
Educational Institute of the American Hotel and Motel Association,
said that guards help prevent crime just by their presence, and
that they should not have tasks that take them away. But he said,
if they escort a guest to a room, they can be tipped like a
bellman.
</P>
<P>
   Salaried people who sit behind desks, like managers of hotels,
are not usually tipped. Luxury-hotel concierges are. When they have
really delivered _ tickets for a hit show for that night, say _
they should get substantial money (perhaps $50 for a couple of $150
tickets) in an envelope, with a note; Incidentally, calling ahead
with requests to the concierge can produce better results.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise lines that permit tipping _ some luxury lines like
Seabourn and Silversea do not _ are not shy about providing
guidance on giving. Almost everywhere, a 15 percent service charge
is added to wine and liquor service, so no further tip is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Housekeepers and dining room workers on cruise ships get nominal
pay, and tips are part of their basic compensation. If no
suggestions are provided, spokeswomen for the Cruise Lines
International Association, a marketing group, say that the basic
tips are $2.50 to $3 a day per passenger for the waiter, the same
amount for whoever cleans the cabin, and half as much for the
dining room bus employee.
</P>
<P>
   Flight attendants are not tipped. Waiters on trains are tipped
as in restaurants: 15 to 20 percent. If the meal is included the
price of the ticket, it is easy to be generous: $5 at a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   People at the car-rental counter are not tipped, but if someone
brings your car to the door in the rain and loads your bags, it's
worth $1 or $2.
</P>
<P>
   Tour guides may be tipped. Paul Luskin, secretary of the Guides
Association of New York, recommends $1 a person. ``But never tip if
it is asked for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Inn on Union Square where tipping was banned in June
1995, ``We asked how much they earned from tips,'' said Brooks
Bayly, the general manager. ``Then we raised their pay that much
and abolished tips.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have a codicil,'' he added. ``If a guest tries to tip an
employee three times, we tell them to accept. Don't want to make a
guest mad.''

<P>
   Only two weeks after the evacuation of the Florida Keys _ when
Hurricane Georges swept through the island chain on Sept. 25,
causing $250 million in losses and cutting off access to popular
tourist spots _ visitors had begun trickling back. It's too soon to
know whether they'll be back in their full numbers, tourism
officials say, especially since the hurricane struck during the off
season. But airports, the Port of Key West, and most hotels and
attractions are now fully operational, they hasten to point out,
and big events like the Halloween Fantasy Fest in Key West, which
began Friday, have not been affected. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The tourism infrastructure is in excellent shape,'' said Andy
Newman, a spokesman for the Monroe County Tourist Development
Council. The tourism agency is spending $2 million to spread the
word that the Keys are far from devastated.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane did, however, uproot trees, defoliate areas,
damage or destroy more than 1,500 houses, including much of the
collection of floating homes known as Houseboat Row in Key West,
and keep some destinations closed. Little Palm Island, a resort of
thatched-roof villas off Little Torch Key, has combined hurricane
cleanup with several renovation projects and does not plan to
reopen until mid-December, officials said. Several state and county
parks with beaches, such as Bahia Honda, Indian Key and Sombrero
Beach, are not welcoming visitors until sometime in November.
Hotels like the Best Western Key Ambassador in Key West have just
partly reopened. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For details about specific properties and the latest
information, tourism officials advise calling (800) 352-5397 or

<P>
   The Longfellow House in Cambridge, Mass., will close today for a
yearlong construction program designed to preserve this
240-year-old National Historic Site.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The house, built in 1759, was not only the home of the poet
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow from 1837 until his death, in 1882, but
also George Washington's headquarters in the early months of the
Revolutionary War.
</P>
<P>
   The National Park Service plans to install environmental
controls in the basement and wine cellar to preserve and house more
than 600,000 historic documents and artifacts. Alterations to the
adjacent carriage house will provide new facilities for education
programs, exhibits and workshops. Wheelchair access to the first
floor of the Longfellow House will be added, and the landscaped
grounds will be restored. The house is expected to reopen sometime
next fall.

   Over the years, world leaders like Nelson Mandela, Tony Blair
and Mahatma Gandhi have been entertained aboard the Britannia, the
luxurious vessel used by Queen Elizabeth and her family around the
world. On Oct. 26 the 412-foot yacht, which has recently been
refurbished, will be opened to the public for tours at the port of
Leith, two miles from the center of Edinburgh.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Britannia, launched on April 16, 1953, was decommissioned
last Dec. 11. Technically a Royal Navy ship, the yacht has sailed
more than a million miles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Budgetary constraints have much to do with the Britannia's new
role as a tourist attraction. British taxpayers spent $160 million
maintaining the yacht over the last 10 years, and a major refit
would have prolonged her life for only a few more years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Visitors reach the ship through a visitor center designed by Sir
Terence Conran. Its centerpiece will be the yacht's 41-foot tender
floating in a pool. Britannia's original wheelhouse will also be
displayed.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once on board, visitors will be guided around Britannia's five
decks by an audio tour. The bridge, the state dining room, the
drawing room and the Royal Apartments _ as they were when occupied
by the royal family, with white walls, bronze metalwork and dark
mahogany woodwork _ will be viewed through door-sized glass panels.
The engine room, the captain's cabin and the galleys are also on
the tour.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Britannia will be open daily except Christmas. A shuttle bus
will run from Princes Street and from Waverley Station in
Edinburgh. Tickets will be $11, $6.35 for children, and must be
booked in advance at (44-131) 555-5566.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's cheaper these days to make a quick stop at any of New
York's major airports and to park long-term at La Guardia.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those picking somebody up or dropping somebody off _ the reason
most people drive to airports _ will find there is a new parking
rate for up to 30 minutes. Daily parking at Kennedy, La Guardia or
Newark now costs $2 for up to half an hour (the previous minimum
rate was $4, for anything up to four hours). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month several other changes took effect at the
airports, including the introduction of long-term parking rates at
La Guardia. Six hundred spaces in Lot 3 are now reserved for
long-term parking. The cost for the first day is $24, the same as
in the daily lots, but each additional day is now only $10, not
$24. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not everything is cheaper: long-term parking at Kennedy costs $2
for the first 12 hours and $2 every additional two hours to a
maximum of $8 a day, up from $7. At Newark, the maximum per day in
Lots D and E (served by the monorail) has increased to $12 from $7.
The maximum daily rate at Lots G and H (served by shuttle bus) has
gone up to $8 from $7. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The expected result: 80 percent of customers will pay less or
the same, according to the Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey, the agency that manages the airports. More information is
available at www.panynj.gov. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   West Mexico has been, relatively speaking, terra incognita in
the cultural world. Though long known for ceramic sculptures, the
present-day states of Jalisco, Colima and Nayarit are only recently
coming into their own for the imposing architecture and complex
society that flourished there between 200 B.C. and 800 A.D. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Ancient West Mexico: Art of the Unknown Past'' _ at the Art
Institute of Chicago through Nov. 22, then at the Los Angeles
County Museum of Art from Dec. 20 to March 29 _ brings together
more than 225 objects that provide a window on the ceremonial life,
everyday customs, economic and agricultural systems, and
architecture of this early civilization. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As archeologists, anthropologists and art historians have
discovered in the past few decades, the region of mountains,
plateaus and basins between the Rio Santiago canyon and the Pacific
Coast was densely populated and rich in creativity. The inhabitants
expressed their beliefs and commemorated family lineages in
mysterious earthenware pieces with a shared imagery but distinctive
local styles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They buried these terra-cotta sculptures and vessels, along with
some jade pieces and shell jewelry, in deep shaft tombs connected
to ceremonial centers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The figures depict men and women feasting, warring and wooing,
and fanciful animals and plants of many kinds; they show festivals,
ritual sports and family gatherings. The show explores esthetic
character, symbolic meaning, function and religious connections,
relating them back to the West Mexican civilization's
4,000-year-old roots and forward to its influence on 20th-century
artists like Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo, Rufino Tamayo and Henry
Moore. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Art Institute of Chicago is open daily. Suggested admission
is $8, and $5 for children, students and seniors. Tuesdays are
free. Information: (312) 443-3600. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles County Museum of Art is open daily except
Wednesday. Admission is $7, $5 for seniors and students, $1 for
children 6 to 17. Information: (323) 857-6000.

WYNN'S CABERNET SAUVIGNON   FROM AUSTRALIA

<TEXT>
<P>
   Wynn's Cabernet Sauvignon 1995, Coonawarra, Australia. About
$14. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Winemakers from South Australia like to send out samples of the
red soil from the Coonawarra region to help explain the character
of their red wines. They are redolent of plums, are both soft and
intensely rich and, at their best, have a pleasingly long
aftertaste.
</P>
<P>
   The South Australians have described their 1995 vintage as
``challenging,'' but not to worry; Coonawarra is probably that
continent's best source of cabernet and this particular example is
a good wine at a good price.
</P>
<P>
   No one will ever mistake an Australian cabernet for a wine from
America or Europe, for which we should be grateful. The
homogenization of wine styles around the world proceeds apace and
is depressing to contemplate.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian style is proudly different, just like the people,
and worth getting to know.

 &HT;    PRESS GOT IT MOSTLY RIGHT IN SCANDAL COVERAGE, STUDY FINDS
 &HT;    680&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ From the blue dress to the cigar, the mainstream
news media have been mostly accurate in chronicling the White House
sex scandal, but sometimes reporters were not skeptical enough
about sources, a watchdog group concluded Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to White House accusations, those doing the bulk of
the original reporting did not ferry false leaks and fabrications
into coverage of the Clinton-Lewinsky story,'' reported the
Committee of Concerned Journalists, a consortium of reporters,
editors, producers, publishers and academics. ``But in some
important cases, the press leaned on the suspicions of
investigators that did not hold up and downplayed the denials of
the accused.''
</P>
<P>
   While Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's impeachment referral
to Congress has substantiated much of the initial reporting, ``it
is an oversimplification to say the press has been vindicated,''
said Bill Kovach, chairman of the committee and the former editor
of the Atlanta Journal and Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The report, ``The Clinton-Lewinsky Story: How Accurate? How
Fair?'', identified threads of the story that went to the crux of
whether the affair occurred and whether the president obstructed
justice and tampered with evidence to cover it up. It also examined
other aspects of the coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The report examined major media outlets, including nightly
newscasts on ABC, NBC, CNN, and PBS, and reporting in the New York
Times, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, USA Today, Time and
Newsweek. This media universe was expanded by searches on the Nexis
text archiving system and Hotline, a daily electronic political
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   The findings included:
</P>
<P>
   _ The blue dress: ABC was accurate in reporting first that
Lewinsky had kept a blue dress stained with the president's semen.
</P>
<P>
   _ The talking points: News media emphasized the importance of a
document titled ``points to make in an affidavit'' that Lewinsky
gave her friend Linda Tripp, with whom she discussed the affair.
The news reports said the document could be the smoking gun proving
witness tampering. However, Starr's referral barely mentioned the
talking points.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vernon Jordan: The news media failed to adequately consider
that Lewinsky might have misled Tripp about what she told Jordan,
the president's friend. That turned out to what happened, according
to Lewinsky's testimony. Some stories overstated what Lewinsky told
Tripp about whether Jordan told her to lie about her affair with
Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   _ Betty Currie: Holding up well was the initial New York Times
story that the president's secretary told investigators that
Clinton called her in and led her through what eventually shown to
be a false account of his relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   _ The cigar. Starting with an Internet posting on the Drudge
Report and advancing to Jay Leno's late-night monologue, the nation
was abuzz with rumors that Clinton and Lewinsky had used a cigar as
a sex toy long before the mainstream media did more than vaguely
mention ``kinky sex.'' Although the initial Drudge Report was wrong
on some details, the Starr Report confirmed use of a cigar in a sex
act near the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   _ Third-party witnesses: From the start of the scandal, there
were media reports that some third-party witness had seen Clinton
and Lewinsky in a compromising act. Some stories indicated that
such a witness would diminish the need for Starr to grant immunity
to Lewinsky. Starr's referral did not establish such a third-party
witness. Thus, the media could have been used by investigative
sources who wanted to pressure Lewinsky into cooperating.
</P>
<P>
   _ A second intern: Although speculation about other women was
often raised on television talk shows, there was no mention of a
so-called second intern in Starr's report or in most of the
mainstream media.
</P>
<P>
   _ Starr's dealings with the press: ``If the coverage at certain
points showed a penchant to reflect the suspicions of prosecutors
... out of balance with the denials of the accused, this would
hardly be unusual,'' the report cautioned. This is ``a growing
tendency of media coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Kovach, now curator of the Neiman Foundation at Harvard
University, and other journalists expressed concern about the
``increasing role of the argument culture'' in coverage of the
scandal involving President Clinton's cover-up of an affair with
Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Especially in television talk shows, ``the principle of keeping
fact separate from suspicion and analysis separate from
agenda-setting is no longer clearly honored,'' the report warned. A
``new class of activist pundits'' who are ``provocateurs'' rather
than journalists or news sources ``may be undermining the reporting
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   The competitive pressure from 24-hour cable news channels such
as CNN, Fox News and MSNBC and from Internet sites may have also
pushed some mainstream media into prematurely reporting some
aspects of the scandal, said some members of a committee panel. The
urge to get rumors or salacious details _ ``what's out there'' _ on
the air or into print often had to be resisted, they said.

 iT ISN'T EASY BEING LINDBERGH'S DAUGHTER 
REPEATING FOR ALL NEEDING &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   BARNET, Vt. When Reeve Lindbergh was a child, she dreamed that
her father was God. After all, she rationalized, she and her
brothers and sisters ``called him `father,' when all of our friends
called their fathers `daddy.'''
</P>
<P>
   And of course, she could find him in the ``Encyclopedia
Britannica'' as Charles A. Lindbergh, the all-American hero, the
man who, over the course of a lonely 33 1/2 hours in May 1927,
became the first to fly solo across the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 71 years after that still awe-inspiring &UR;  &LR; flight (which
took place 18 years before her birth), Lindbergh smiles and tosses
her head back at a question about that childhood dream, which she
relates in her just-published memoir, ``Under A Wing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, he was like that,'' she said. ``He was big and he had an
amazing presence. Piercing blue eyes. And everything he said was
right.'' But then, ``He was also different from that. He could
relax and be quite silly, tumbling with us on the floor, carrying
me piggy-back around the house.''
</P>
<P>
   There was, she thought, ``an inside view and an outside view.''
Outside, in public, ``I had the feeling that my father would put on
a uniform, the Lindbergh uniform,'' she said, ``but then at other
times, he would dissolve into a warm human being.''
</P>
<P>
   For Lindbergh, 53, it is an extraordinary legend to carry
through life. While she dealt with some aspects of it in her 1993
novel, ``The Names of Mountains,'' the memoir is her first effort
to deal with it directly.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents rarely spoke to their children about the public
events that made their lives so legendary. For the flight to Paris,
Lindbergh would refer the children to his book about it, telling
them, ``It's all in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, the kidnapping and death of her parents' first-born
in March 1932 was a closed subject. And, Reeve Lindbergh says now,
``The things they didn't talk about are still painful. They hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   In a chilling parallel to her parents' tragedy, Reeve Lindbergh
lost her son from her first marriage, Jonathan, to infantile
encephalitis in 1985 before his second birthday. He was the age
that her brother was when he was kidnapped. Her mother, Anne Morrow
Lindbergh, now 92, was with her the night her son died, Lindbergh
said, and insisted they sit with Jonathan's body until the medical
examiner came. ``I never saw my son's body,'' she told her
daughter. ``I never sat with my son this way.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The intertwined triumph and tragedy of the Lindbergh legend is
well known, particularly among those of a certain age. She said
that people constantly want to tell her their connection to the
legend. At a children's book event _ Lindbergh has written 13 books
for children _ author and illustrator Maurice Sendak told her that
his nightmare memory of the kidnapping, which occurred when he was
4, is the psychological basis for his classic children's tale,
``Where the Wild Things Are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a nightmare for people of that age,'' said Lindbergh.
</P>
<P>
   But for younger generations, the legend is dimmer.
</P>
<P>
   She laughs about the reaction of Eli and Sam, the teenage sons
of her second husband, Nathaniel Tripp, whom she married in 1987.
``They knew it was a big deal,'' she said. ``But not what kind of a
big deal. I think they were more excited about my teenage daughters
_ Elizabeth and Susannah _ moving in with them.''
</P>
<P>
   For herself, whatever burden the Lindbergh legend may be, it
appears one she has learned to live with.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; After 30 years in Vermont _ she moved there after graduating
from Radcliffe in 1968 with her first husband, Richard Brown, a
Harvard classmate _ she has the outdoorsy look that comes with
too-short summers and snow-laden winters.
</P>
<P>
   She has graying blonde, tousled hair that becomes more so as she
runs her fingers through it while pausing to recollect during
several hours of conversation. She is often described as slight of
build. It is a slightness that resembles her mother's in the
memorable photograph in which, dressed in aviator's flight gear,
she is standing next to her husband. The smile is the same.
</P>
<P>
   Lindbergh lives now in far up-country Vermont with Tripp and
their son, 11-year-old Benjamin.
</P>
<P>
   The farm, a mile and a half in from the state highway at the end
of a dirt road, is not in gentrified country. It is the kind of
back-country farm where once you might have found derelict cars
behind the barn and broken appliances on the front porch.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, there are chickens and a flock of 16 sheep. There is
also an old cow and an old horse that ``don't serve any purpose,''
Lindbergh said. ``Just hang out.'' Tripp figures ``the maximum this
farm could produce is $3,000 to $4,000 a year _ gross.'' Which is
why, he said, ``we produce books'': Lindbergh's children's books,
the 1993 novel, this memoir, and Tripp's ``Father, Soldier, Son; A
Memoir of a Platoon Leader in Vietnam,'' published in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As for their 1840s farmhouse, it has the rumpled look of one
whose occupants care more about the living than the appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Although his sons and her children are grown and gone _ the only
one still at home is Benjamin, a visitor might think the house is
full of children.
</P>
<P>
   In the kitchen is a large, hand-drawn poster looking much like
an illustration from one of Lindbergh's children's books, setting
out various rules of the house: no more than three in the bathtub
at a time, including animals; no using the washing machine when
someone is taking a shower; and no racoons or peacocks allowed
inside the house. A World War II board game that Ben is playing
sprawls across the living room table.
</P>
<P>
   Lindbergh works in a small room off the kitchen, where the
clutter, extraordinary even by the usual standards of authors'
offices, swamps her computer. But there is a idyllic view up a
hillside meadow where several bluebird houses have been set out on
poles. Occasionally, deer appear out of the early morning fog at
the edge of the nearby woods. Their visits are rare enough,
Lindbergh said, ``that there is still a kind of magic in them.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly absent from the house is any noticeable Lindbergh
memorabilia. The only things she has, Lindbergh says, are personal
items _ like a little green eraser of her father's, a wooden ruler
on which her mother had written her initials, ``and the little
glasses case my father gave my mother to hold when she was in
labor'' and in which he had written the names of all the children
as they came along, from the kidnapped Charles through Jon, Land,
and Scott to Anne and then Reeve.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a family like ours,'' she said, ``it's the personal things
that matter.''
</P>
<P>
   But with her memoir and with ``Lindbergh,'' a biography of her
father by A. Scott Berg also published this fall, it's the family
legend that's drawing new attention.
</P>
<P>
   Berg, who began working on the biography in 1990, spent
considerable time with all surviving family members, but
particularly with Reeve, whom he saw as the gatekeeper of the
family's extensive _ and never before opened _ archives. ``We had a
symbiotic relationship,'' he said. ``She'd send me chapters of her
memoir as she finished them. I don't think I used anything from
them, but I got a lot of attitudes from it.''
</P>
<P>
   And as Lindbergh worked on her memoir, originally begun as a
memorial to her sister Anne, who died in 1993, Berg became a
source. ``I'd call him for dates,'' she said. ```Scott,' I'd say,
`what was I doing in 1953?'''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the time when Berg came up to Vermont around
Christmas in 1992, a time chosen, Lindbergh said, because the
family, including Anne Morrow Lindbergh and all the children, would
be gathered for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   One night after dinner, she said, Berg sat down at the piano and
started playing Cole Porter tunes. After a bit, he came to
``Anything Goes'' and when he did, ``All of a sudden, my mother got
up from where she was sitting, all curled up, and walked over
toward the piano. And every time he got to the chorus, she would
sing in a tiny voice, `Anything Goes.'''
</P>
<P>
   Anne Morrow Lindbergh was 86 that year and, as her daughter
said, ``she was pretty frail and lots had gone for her, but she
still remembered `Anything Goes.'''
</P>
<P>
   From her childhood, Lindbergh remembers the lists of misdeeds
that her father would confront his children with on his return from
extended trips overseas or around the country: ``rake left out in
the rain,'' ``reading comics,'' or lapses in the ``freedom and
responsibility'' category.
</P>
<P>
   But looking back now, what she remembers is ``knowing him at a
good period in his life'' when he would come up to Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Lindbergh the aviator _ including some 50 World War II
missions in the South Pacific as a civilian _ had become Lindbergh
the conservationist. And, she said, he was ``more relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize how much the country meant to him,'' she
said. ``But he would come up and reminisce about varities of corn
and ways of raising sheep. These were things that were clearly in
his heart.''
</P>
<P>
   (AT)5SIDEBAR
</P>
<P>
   Aviator's biographer had access to family archive &QC; 
(AT)7 A major challenge for A. Scott Berg in writing his
just-published biography of hero-aviator Charles A. Lindbergh was
retelling the story of the incredible 33 1/2-hour solo flight
across the Atlantic in 1927.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston to promote ``Lindbergh,'' Berg said, ``I had a lot to
compete with, including Lindbergh himself, who did it so well'' in
his 1954 Pulitzer Prize-winning account, ``The Spirit of St.
Louis.''
</P>
<P>
   But in trying to recapture the atmosphere and excitement that
surrounded the event, Berg had the good fortune of hearing an
account from actor Jimmy Stewart, who played Lindbergh in the 1957
film.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the loveliest account I had,'' said Berg. The flight
occurred on Stewart's 17th birthday, Berg said, and he had stayed
up most of the night waiting for news. ``He talked about it to me
as if it was just the day before.''
</P>
<P>
   Berg, 49, lives in Los Angeles. He began work on the Lindbergh
biography in 1990. His biography of editor Maxwell Perkins won the
National Book Award in 1979. Following that, he wrote a biography
of film mogul Samuel Goldwyn.
</P>
<P>
   An equally great challenge, Berg said, was providing a
definitive account of the kidnapping of Lindbergh's infant son _
the ``crime of the century'' when it occurred in 1932.
</P>
<P>
   Having secured permission from Lindbergh's widow, Anne Morrow
Lindbergh, Berg had access to previously unexamined family
archives, including letters that family members wrote to each other
during the three years between the kidnapping and the murder trial
and conviction of Bruno Richard Hauptmann.

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ (his impeachment.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can certainly consider it a high crime and
misdemeanor by lying to the American public,'' Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy has been more low-key on the issue, although she has
called the president a liar and said he should be held accountable.
</P>
<P>
   But in more competitive races, neither candidate typically says
much. In Missouri's high-profile Senate race, for example,
Republican Kit Bond and Democrat Jay Nixon have thrown brickbats at
each other over all sorts of issues _ but not over the president.
</P>
<P>
   Bond's top campaign aide, David Israelite, said polling
indicates that Republicans will benefit as a result of Clinton's
troubles. And he acknowledged that consultants have urged Bond to
run against the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite that evidence,'' Israelite said, ``Kit has not made it
a focus because he believes that he should focus this campaign on
issues important in the Senate race.''
</P>
<P>
   In Nixon's camp, campaign manager Chuck Hatfield says much the
same thing, although he admits that Nixon might begin criticizing
the GOP more forcefully in the campaign's final two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Attacking Republicans in a state with a strong Democratic
tradition such as Missouri is one thing. But in GOP-rich Kansas,
another approach might be better.
</P>
<P>
   That may explain why 3rd District congressional candidate Dennis
Moore, a Democrat, isn't criticizing Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``People bring it up, but it doesn't affect their views of the
candidates here because they don't see it as relevant to this
race,'' said Moore spokesman Mark Nevens.
</P>
<P>
   Moore sometimes isn't even asked about the controversy at some
events, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president lied. He lied to the public. He lied to his
daughter, his staff,'' Nevens said. ``That doesn't change the level
of disappointment whether you're a Democrat or Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore's opponent, Vince Snowbarger, also isn't risking
alienating swing voters. Snowbarger was one of the first members of
Congress to call for the president's resignation. But he, too,
hasn't made Clinton an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a Republican in New Hampshire, you can pretty much
skewer the president and be in good shape,'' said Snowbarger aide
Kevin Yowell. ``That's not the case here.''

VOTERS HAVE CHOICES BEYOND BOND, NIXON FOR SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL SENTELL  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. _ Republican Kit Bond and Democrat Jay Nixon
have won most of the attention in the race for U.S. Senate, but
Missouri voters have three other choices when they go to the polls
Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Libertarian nominee Tamara Millay of St. Louis wants to end the
war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party nominee James F. Newport of Blue Springs wants to
pressure the banking industry to beef up safety at automated teller
machines, which are common sites for crimes.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Taxpayers Party nominee Curt Frazier of Springfield wants
to all but scrap the nation's public education system.
</P>
<P>
   All three are waging low-key campaigns. They have little money
and argue that a choice between Bond and Nixon isn't really a
choice at all.
</P>
<P>
   Millay was a virtual spectator during a televised debate earlier
this month that featured repeated charges between Nixon and Bond.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were so focused on insulting each other,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Money is one of a few signs that the campaigns for all three
alternative candidates are mostly symbolic.
</P>
<P>
   Bond has reported raising about $6 million for his campaign,
while Nixon has raised about $2 million. Newport, Millay and
Frazier plan to spend about $17,000 combined, enough for each to
have one 30-second TV ad in Kansas City during ``60 Minutes'' or
``20/20.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if all three are long shots, they have lengthy campaign
agendas.
</P>
<P>
   Millay, 31, is a recruiter for the computer industry. She said
she favors making Social Security a private enterprise, opposes
gun-control laws and says citizens are unfairly required to help
finance public schools. Charter schools and home schooling should
be encouraged, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Millay said one of her key proposals is to end the nation's war
on illegal drugs. Drugs should be legalized with restrictions
similar to laws that govern alcohol, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the drug laws create far more harm than the
drugs themselves and are responsible for much of the crime we
see,'' Millay said.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching young people to avoid drugs primarily should be the
responsibility of parents, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Millay also favors abolishing the federal income tax. She said
revenue from existing excise taxes would finance the only services
the federal government should provide, such as a national defense
and law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that taking money away from people's earnings is
really an unfair way to fund the government since it punishes
people for being productive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Newport, a 43-year-old steel company employee, has staked out a
wide range of stands.
</P>
<P>
   He said requiring 911 access at all automated teller machines is
one of his primary goals.
</P>
<P>
   Newport said the banking industry has failed to recognize that
it must protect customers at ATMs. Holdups at the machines would
decline if customers had handy access to an emergency telephone, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In international policy, Newport proposed using sophisticated
missiles to combat possible threats from Second- and Third World
countries. Otherwise, actions by nations like Afghanistan could
become the spark that ignites World War III, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Newport said environmental problems deserve more attention. He
argues that society hasn't used all the tools at its disposal to
combat documented problems. For example, he said the technology
already exists to replenish the ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who wants to know how to do it _ I will tell them,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Newport said all health-insurance premiums should be
tax-deductible. And while he generally agrees with the stances of
the National Rifle Association, Newport believes gun owners have a
duty to secure their weapons from children.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier, a 42-year-old Springfield physician, said public
education has been a ``colossal failure'' and that schools should
be controlled by local officials.
</P>
<P>
   Students today are taught multiculturalism and other ideas that
destroy their hearts and minds rather than getting instruction in
morals and the nation's Christian heritage, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government has no constitutional authority in the
realm of education,'' Frazier said.
</P>
<P>
   He also criticized the reliance on property tax revenue as a key
source for public education funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has overstepped its bounds in invading personal
property rights of its citizens,'' Frazier said.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier said Congress has unconstitutionally surrendered its
powers to unelected officials, the United Nations and others and
subverted American freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we lose our sovereignty, we lose all of our God-given
rights,'' he said.

RELIGION IS A TRICKY ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Attorney General Dan Lungren has entered
the final two weeks of the gubernatorial campaign in much the same
way he started it: by invoking religion.
</P>
<P>
   Where earlier he tried to open a discussion of religious values,
the Republican candidate is now using his Catholic faith to justify
his staunch opposition to abortion and to deflect criticism from
Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, the Democratic nominee who favors abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Using religion as an issue in the political arena comes with
some baggage. Lungren has been accused of being hypocritical
because he supports the death penalty, which the Catholic Church
also opposes.
</P>
<P>
   In a 60-second radio spot now running, Lungren's wife Bobbi
says: ``Gray Davis is using the emotional issue of abortion as a
divisive wedge issue. He should have more respect for the deeply
held personal beliefs of others. As life-long Catholics, Dan and I
have deeply held religious and moral convictions, and we have
always been pro-life.''
</P>
<P>
   Religion can be a tricky issue for a politician. Kathleen Brown,
a Democrat who ran and lost against Gov. Pete Wilson in 1994, was
criticized for citing her Catholic faith as the basis for her
opposition to the death penalty. Yet she supported abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren has opened himself up to scrutiny for the same kind of
contradiction. The Catholic Church is opposed to both abortion and
the death penalty, but Lungren has said he would work diligently to
clear a backlog of 450 death row inmates, and he was the first
attorney general since 1977 to oversee an execution.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion, Lungren has said, kills innocent children, but the
death penalty is reserved for those who take a life. ``If you don't
understand the difference between innocent life and non-innocent
life, then you have missed a fundamental proposition of not only
the teachings of the Catholic Church, but the fundamentals of
American democracy,'' Lungren said in March.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Church is fairly forgiving about members who differ
from church dogma, but theologians say Lungren cannot use the
church to justify one position while ignoring the same fundamental
tenet: that life is sacred from inception to grave.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll find many Catholics who pick and choose among which
beliefs they will hold, just as many politicians do,'' said the
Rev. Joseph Daoust, professor of religion and society at the Jesuit
School of Theology in Berkeley. ``One should _ just to be logical,
much less faithful _ be opposed to both.''
</P>
<P>
   Daoust said Lungren could hold an anti-abortion stance, but the
``rationale cannot be that he's Catholic. It's got to be because of
the fundamental values that underlie church teachings.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis told the editorial board of the San Francisco Examiner
that the biggest hole in Lungren's argument was ``something called
the separation of church and state.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said he was willing to go against the church when it came
to policies he disagreed with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has helped shape me as a person,'' Davis said of his
Catholic faith. ``I have empathy for people who are dealing with
problems and need some assistance. ... I guess the answer would be
my religion would not affect the judgments I make on behalf of the
people.''

LEWINSKY ISSUE IGNORED IN CONGRESSIONAL CAMPAIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Monica?
</P>
<P>
   Monica who?
</P>
<P>
   Although no news story has so dominated Washington this year,
most congressional candidates in the Heartland are barely
mentioning impeachment, much less President Clinton's now-infamous
former intern, Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   It's the big issue that's disappeared faster than you can say,
``House Judiciary Committee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got back from a 17-city tour in southwest Kansas,''
said Paul Feleciano of Wichita, the Democratic U.S. Senate
candidate. ``I didn't have one question about it. Absolutely zero.
It's a non-issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The great irony is that the November election is being viewed in
some quarters as a referendum on the president's future. According
to the theory, if Republicans pick up a boatload of House and
Senate seats, Clinton is toast.
</P>
<P>
   But the question of how, or whether, Congress should discipline
the philandering president is hardly ever raised by candidates,
especially those in competitive races. They prefer for the audience
to initiate the subject, rather than risk appearing too eager to
score points on such a divisive issue.
</P>
<P>
   And that's one big reason candidates are avoiding the topic. The
question of impeachment is polarizing. Polls show the country split
on the question of whether the House did the right thing by
launching an impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Voters also are sharply divided on what should happen next.
Should Clinton apologize or resign if he lied under oath? Should
Congress censure him, impeach him or drop it altogether?
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they're weary of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just no one who really wants to hear one bit more
about it,'' said Burdett Loomis, a University of Kansas political
scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Republicans could criticize Clinton for his
transgressions. They could point out that electing Democrats
further insulates the president from punishment.
</P>
<P>
   And Democrats could bang on Republicans for prolonging the
matter through the open-ended impeachment inquiry they approved.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, candidates are gambling because they risk alienating
voters who believe differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if they see a potential gain, they're worried about the
potential risk and down side of using it,'' said Stuart Rothenberg,
editor of the Rothenberg Political Report. ``Nobody sees it as a
home run.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, candidates are sticking to more traditional concerns:
HMO reform, Social Security, health care, taxes.
</P>
<P>
   But there are exceptions, particularly among long-shot
challengers who have little to lose. They tend to talk much more
bluntly.
</P>
<P>
   Take Cecilia Noland, a Republican from Osage Beach, Mo., who is
challenging Rep. Ike Skelton of Lexington in the state's 4th
District. Clinton, she says, should be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter is, he lied under oath and that's
perjury and that's where the impeachment process comes in,'' Noland
said.
</P>
<P>
   She usually introduces the subject with audiences and rarely
regrets it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I get the biggest applause,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another challenger, Republican Penny Bennett of Independence,
who is challenging incumbent Democratic Rep. Karen McCarthy, also
has made impeachment a top issue. She has repeatedly implored
McCarthy, of Kansas City, to demand Clinton's resignation or insist
upon his impeachment. (MORE)

PET PEEVES FALL INTO TWO CATEGORIES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most linguistic pet peeves fall into one of two categories.
There are the clear transgressions _ we can all agree that Go
Patriot's, which reader Janice Aviza must endure at her workplace,
is nonstandard punctuation. Then there are the less clear-cut (and
more numerous) cases: You may have learned, as I did, that forte,
meaning ``strength,'' should be one syllable, but the arguments for
FORT over FOR-tay are strained at best.
</P>
<P>
   Some pet peeves, though, seem to come out of nowhere. One of
these is the resistance to some in the sense of approximately, as
in a recent Globe story about ``some 75 air traffic controllers''
coping with a computer malfunction. David Chirlin of Nashua wonders
whether some, used this way, is ``simply an excuse for sloppy
writing or laziness in fact gathering.'' And several Globe copy
editors share his feeling that there's something shady about some,
and routinely change it to about or approximately.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know where the distaste comes from, because some in this
sense is no tacky modern invention; the Oxford English Dictionary
has a citation from the year 888 _ yes, with three digits _ as well
as examples from Shakespeare, Dryden, Ruskin, and other worthies.
You may not like the American twist that came along three decades
ago _ the inversion twenty-some years, which led straight to
thirtysomething and its variations _ but that neologism should not
retrospectively taint the older some.
</P>
<P>
   Myself, I'm very fond of some. Approximately is a real mouthful,
the rhythmic equivalent of five potholes in a row; about may do the
job, but often it's needed for other purposes in a nearby sentence,
and besides, one syllable may work better than two.
</P>
<P>
   As for the question of laziness, that's a judgment to make case
by case: For blood sugar levels or batting averages, precise
numbers matter; but when the point is to show a bunch of air
controllers in a tense situation, nailing down the number _ 73, 75,
77 _ may not be the most important part of the job. (An excess of
precision can even be distracting; rarely does the reader care
whether a 45-year-old is barely 45 or on the brink of 46.)
</P>
<P>
   There is another, more recent some discussed in the usage books.
This is the some immortalized by E.B. White, of Strunk &AMP; White
fame. In his book ``Charlotte's Web,'' Charlotte saves her friend
Wilbur's bacon by weaving the words ``SOME PIG!'' above his head.
This some is a colloquialism, perhaps best used in pigsties and
other informal settings. But the ancient usage deserves to go its
way unhindered, after some 11 centuries of faithful service.
</P>
<P>
   (AT)5Reasonably seasonable
</P>
<P>
   (AT)7 The gray weather that's been gloom-ifying what should be
New England's best month prompted me to pull out a note from Henry
B. Schoenberger of Laconia, N.H. _ written several months ago,
probably in response to the equally dispiriting dampness of May _
questioning the bona fides of the word seasonable. ``Does it mean
that the weather outside today is `able' to be a `season'?''
Schoenberger inquired. ``When weatherpersons talk about seasonable
weather, wouldn't they be more correct talking about seasonal
weather?''
</P>
<P>
   No question about it, seasonable looks odd next to most of its
able-suffixed siblings. If it were parallel to lovable or crushable
or understandable, it would mean ``able (or worthy) of being
seasoned'' _ but it doesn't. If it were like perishable, it would
mean ``able to season''; wrong again, though it did have that
meaning centuries ago. But there is a group of -able words that,
while they aren't so easily analyzed, are perfectly respectable.
The dictionaries give them a broad description _ ``having qualities
of'' (comfortable), ``tending or inclined to (peaceable,
knowledgeable). Seasonable, meaning appropriate to the season, will
simply have to squeeze in somewhere under this spacious umbrella;
we've been using the word to talk about the weather since at least
the 1300s, and it's too late to banish it now.
</P>
<P>
   Seasonal, meanwhile, simply means ``of the season''; we see
seasonal variations in consumer spending, and seasonal sales when
too much remains unsold. Both words, of course, are useful only if
we have identifiable seasons. If climate change turns out to be a
real phenomenon, both seasonal and seasonable may have to go into
the deep freeze till we know what we can expect of a day in June.

BOND, NIXON SHARE MANY GOALS, DIFFER ON HOW TO REACH THEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ (financial lifeline.)
</P>
<P>
   Their dispute revolves around whether Bond actually means what
he says. Nixon said that Bond, through Senate votes and a candidate
questionnaire, has opened the door to using some of the surpluses
to cut taxes or retire the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Bond denies fudging, saying he agreed with President Clinton
last January that only when Social Security is on sound footing
should the surpluses be eyed for tax cuts or debt reduction.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an opportunity that should not be passed up or wasted
by political posturing,'' Bond said.
</P>
<P>
   Just as they pledge to rescue Social Security, Nixon and Bond
said the nation's schools need more money for teachers, buildings
and supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Bond is touting a ``Direct Check for Education'' program that
would send an additional $13 billion to schools. Only $1 billion of
that would be new money; the rest would come from savings by
consolidating programs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you eliminate the bureaucratic steps in Washington and
Jefferson City, there will be more money at the end of the
pipeline,'' Bond said.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon isn't impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mind numbing to talk about `direct check' when there's no
money behind it,'' Nixon said. ``It's an amazing election-year
concept.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon said more money is needed, but he didn't say how much.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting drugs was high on the list of Bond and Nixon and they
both focused on the methamphetamine problem in Missouri. Both want
more money for meth efforts, but Bond is more specific.
</P>
<P>
   Bond proposed giving $2 million to the Missouri Department of
Conservation for meth cleanup and also thinks money should be
available from the federal Superfund that is set aside for
toxic-waste cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to more money to fight meth, Nixon said there needs
to be broadened cooperation between state and federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   To that end and other crime-fighting efforts, Nixon said
Congress must continue toward a goal of helping pay to put 100,000
more officers on local police forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing fights crime better than making sure we have more
officers on the street,'' Nixon said.
</P>
<P>
   Bond prefers to let local police departments decide how to use
any additional money.
</P>
<P>
   On taxes, Bond and Nixon both favor simplifying the tax code and
reducing the number of deductions that result in many forms and
myriad tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tax code has become far too much of a social engineering
project, that's why it's so complicated,'' Bond said.
</P>
<P>
   Bond said the deductions for mortgage interest and charitable
donations should remain and that deductions for premiums the
self-employed pay for insurance should be allowed. Nixon agrees.
</P>
<P>
   Bond also would like to end what he said is a tax penalty for
getting married. A single person should not have to pay more taxes
after marriage if nothing else about his or her tax status changes,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon did not indicate specific tax-code changes but said, ``I
would maintain some deductions, certainly.'' Nixon said people are
too confused about what they owe and when they owe it.
</P>
<P>
   One issue where Nixon and Bond are in sharp disagreement was
tabled earlier but may make a comeback: Campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon was an outspoken supporter of a Senate bill aimed at
people and groups that skirt election laws to help pay for a
candidate's campaign advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations, unions and wealthy individuals are known to give
large sums to national political parties to run commercials that
mention candidates by name but stop short of urging that voters
support them at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Limits on how much can be given to individual candidates do not
apply to what is given to national parties, and that can result in
substantial sums being used indirectly to benefit the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Bond opposed a Democratic bill that would have regulated such
spending and required it be disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bond's vote to kill the bill is yet another case of him voting
to protect special interests and coddling big-money donors,'' Nixon
said after the Senate vote last month.
</P>
<P>
   Bond said voting for the bill would restrict free speech.
</P>
<P>
   Also, he said, ``We have an ineffective enforcement system, and
we haven't been able to get the cooperation of the administration
on how many laws were broken.'' As an example, he cited foreign
contributions to President Clinton's re-election campaign in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to convert his goals to accomplishments in the Senate,
Bond said his experience will be an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon said a senator's experience is less important than whose
interest he or she is representing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if you're a veteran or a young senator,''
Nixon said. ``It's a question of what side of the fight you're
on.''

BOND, NIXON SHARE MANY GOALS, DIFFER ON HOW TO REACH THEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Kit Bond and Jay Nixon are asked to name the
four or five most pressing issues they will face if they win this
fall's race for the U.S. Senate, they sound a lot alike.
</P>
<P>
   Both mentioned reforming managed health care, saving Social
Security, spending more money on education and fighting crime,
especially drug traffic. Bond added tax-code reform to the list.
</P>
<P>
   But their shared goals do not beget shared solutions. And on
issues neither put on their priority list, such as campaign finance
reform, they are especially divided.
</P>
<P>
   Republican incumbent Bond says there has been far too little
attention to issues in the campaign. Bond has put out a series of
papers since mid-August detailing his views, but he says they have
been all but ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Nixon, on the other hand, has drafted no formal set of
position papers. But, ``I don't think it's very difficult to say
where I stand on the issues,'' said Nixon, who has been Missouri's
attorney general for six years.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates' key issues have something in common: They tend
to affect the daily lives of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the things they want resolved,'' Bond said.
</P>
<P>
   One such issue, Bond and Nixon said, is the managed health-care
system that covers about 160 million Americans who are in some form
of health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Participants pay a flat fee for coverage, giving HMOs an
incentive to keep costs as low as possible. Patients complain that
this limits their treatment options and access to specialists and
emergency services.
</P>
<P>
   Bond and Nixon want to give patients more choices, but they
differ in how far the government should go in that effort.
</P>
<P>
   Bond wants to limit some of the key changes to about one-third
of the nation's HMO participants _ those in self-insured,
employer-sponsored plans subject to federal regulation. States
would regulate the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon likes the Democratic proposal that would cover all plans
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of whether a patient should be able to sue the HMO,
not just the physician, for malpractice, Nixon says they should.
Bond disagrees but says patients should be able to appeal to a
board if denied coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 56 new reasons for trial lawyers to sue under the
(Democratic) bill,'' Bond said, noting that trial lawyers often are
major political contributors. ``No wonder Mr. Nixon is for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon said a patient's right to adequate treatment should extend
to the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want anybody to have to sue. I want them to get the
health care they need,'' Nixon said. ``If an HMO denies them
options, yeah, they should have the right to sue.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, neither the Republican nor Democratic plan
passed Congress this year. But discussion is expected to resume in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Another matter left unsettled is what to do with an estimated
$70 billion budget surplus this year and a projected $1.6 trillion
surplus over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Nixon and Bond are in basic agreement that any budget
surpluses should go directly into the Social Security fund that
could go broke in about 30 years if Congress doesn't toss it a
financial lifeline. (MORE)

RIGHT WAY, WRONG SPEED FOR PARITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILIAN MINCER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Change is coming, but it's slow: so slow in fact, that at the
current rate it'll take until 2064 for gender parity on Fortune 500
boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The change is in the right direction, but it's small and has
been painfully slow,'' said Mary Mattis, vice president for
research and advisory services at Catalyst, which for the last six
years has monitored the progress of America's major corporations.
</P>
<P>
   According to this year's census released Thursday, only 11.1
percent of Fortune 500 companies have at least one woman on their
board of directors. That's up from 10.6 percent in 1997 and 8.3
percent in 1993, when Catalyst did its first survey.
</P>
<P>
   While 71 Fortune 500 companies _ including five in Missouri _
still don't have any women directors, 188 companies have more than
one woman board member, and last year Golden West Financial Corp.
reached gender parity.
</P>
<P>
   The two Kansas Fortune 500 companies on the list _ Sprint Corp.
and Yellow Corp. _ both have at least one woman. In Missouri,
neither Farmland Industries nor Interstate Bakeries have any women
directors, according to the census.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest frustration, Mattis said, is that there's no
excuse not to have a woman director because there are plenty of
qualified candidates. Catalyst's Corporate Board Placement has
identified at least 2,000 potential women directors.
</P>
<P>
   One of the obstacles, said Mattis, is that boards are shrinking
and have little turnover. But companies are slowly recognizing that
they need women directors because not only are women consumers and
stockholders, women offer a different perspective that enriches a
board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only do women bring special skills and experience to a
board, they do things in a different way,'' Mattis said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's why boards with women appear to be doing better
than those without.
</P>
<P>
   The top 100 Fortune 500 companies are twice as likely as those
at the bottom 100 to have women directors. And the top 10 companies
all have at least one woman. The top eight of these have at least
two, and General Motors, the No. 1. ranked company, has three.
</P>
<P>
   While we need more CEOs and boards reaching out to women, women
also have a responsibility to develop their careers so that they
get the experience necessary for these positions.
</P>
<P>
   Mattis emphasized that women need to take more risks in their
careers. That means women need to make sure they get a well-rounded
experience and take on projects that are challenging and may
require relocating.
</P>
<P>
   Women also need to sit on the boards of small companies and
larger nonprofits because that's where they'll get the experience
they need and the opportunities to meet the people who will
eventually appoint them to larger boards.

ABSENTEE BALLOTING SNAFU SPARKS SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE CHAO and RACHEL GORDON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Three candidates for local office have sued the
city of San Francisco for leaving their Chinese names off thousands
of absentee voter booklets.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed Monday in Superior Court, accuses the
Department of Elections of not translating into Chinese the names
of Supervisor Mabel Teng; Victor Marquez, a candidate for the Board
of Supervisors; and Carlota del Portillo, an incumbent candidate
for the Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that Chinese voters who read only Chinese will be
deprived of a full choice of candidates, the lawsuit asks the
elections office to send a correction sheet to those who have
received a ballot and allow those who have already voted to cast
another ballot if they so choose.
</P>
<P>
   About 47,000 absentee ballots have been sent out. John
Whitehurst, Teng's campaign manager, said about 5,000 of those
voters had Chinese surnames, though it is unknown how many cannot
read English.
</P>
<P>
   Naomi Nishioka, acting director of the Department of Elections,
said last week the omission was not an error, as the lawsuit
alleges. She said the candidates in question had declined her offer
to have their names printed in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   At the Board of Supervisors meeting Monday, Supervisor Michael
Yaki tried to push through an emergency resolution that asked the
elections officer to mail out corrected absentee ballots with a
letter of explanation.
</P>
<P>
   But using a procedural maneuver, Supervisor Leland Yee blocked
passage of the resolution and forced the measure to be sent to
committee for a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Yee said he had concerns that the Department of Elections was
being blamed for a problem that might have been the fault of the
individual campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are going to be concerned about the problem, then I
think we have to know exactly how it was caused,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Leslie Katz suggested that henceforth, elections
officials translate every candidates' name into Chinese.

PERFECT MATCH: PEARS AND BLACKBERRIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 This is the second of eight columns by Francois Payard, the chef
and owner of Payard Patisserie and Bistro in Manhattan. Payard's
collaborator on these columns is Dorie Greenspan.

<P>
   Even though I am a pastry chef, I think in terms of three-course
menus. When I'm creating a dessert tasting menu, the ``appetizer''
is always light, cool and fruity like this pear. Then there's the
middle sweet, maybe something vanilla- or coffee-flavored,
sometimes another fruit, perhaps a tart or a napoleon. And finally,
the main dessert: usually it's chocolate, as much because people
love it as because it is, by its nature, a finisher. It dulls the
palate for anything but a strong espresso.
</P>
<P>
   But this pear is a dessert that can stand alone. It's formidable
_ even though it's low in calories and has no butter or cream _
because it has three parts: a pear poached in a fresh blackberry
syrup, the syrup, which becomes the sauce, and a pear-verbena
sorbet.
</P>
<P>
   My dessert is inspired by the classic pear poached in spiced red
wine, but it doesn't have the strong _ make that overpowering _
flavor of the spices and wine. By using pureed blackberries (black
currants are great, too, but they're harder to find) I have kept
the wine's depth of flavor but eliminated its heaviness. And
blackberries are terrific with pears.
</P>
<P>
   I use Bartletts because they're sweet and have good texture.
What's more, once they're poached and macerated overnight in the
syrup, they're gorgeous red on the outside and still pale ivory on
the inside. I serve the pear upright in a martini glass surrounded
by its syrup, and then I tuck a little scoop of sorbet inside the
pear as a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, everything about the sorbet is surprising. First of
all, I make it with canned pears. Canned fruit, pureed with its
syrup, is perfect for sorbet. Then I add verbena, a subtle herb
that I use as an infusion. In fact, the same verbena that you buy
in the health-food store to make infusions or tisanes can be used
in this sorbet.
</P>
<P>
   As good as it is, the sorbet is not an absolute must. You can
use store-bought pear sorbet, or even lemon sorbet, or you can just
skip it. The poached pear in blackberry sauce is appetizing enough
on its own.
</P>
<P>
   BLACKBERRY PEARS WITH PEAR-VERBENA SORBET &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes, plus overnight chilling &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the pears: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pinch vitamin C powder (available at pharmacies) or 1 tablespoon
lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   4 perfectly ripe Bartlett pears
</P>
<P>
   3 pints fresh blackberries
</P>
<P>
   1\ cups sugar &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the sorbet: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   \ cup boiling water
</P>
<P>
   5 fresh verbena leaves or 1 tablespoon dried
</P>
<P>
   1 15-ounce can pear halves in light syrup
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon lime juice
</P>
<P>
   Poire William eau de vie, optional. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. To make the pears, dissolve the vitamin C powder in a large
bowl of cold water or add lemon juice to the water; keep close at
hand. One by one, peel the pears, leaving their stems, and drop
them into the water.
</P>
<P>
   2. Puree the blackberries in a blender or food processor, and
strain them into a pot deep enough to hold pears in one layer. Add
1 quart water and the sugar, and bring to a boil. Lower the heat so
that the syrup simmers, and add the pears. If the pears aren't
submerged in the syrup, weight them down with a saucer or colander.
Poach the pears 10 to 15 minutes, or until a sharp knife pierces
them easily. Remove from the heat, cover the pot with a kitchen
towel, and cool to room temperature. Chill, still covered,
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   3. To make the sorbet, pour the boiling water over the verbena.
Cover with plastic wrap, and infuse 10 minutes; strain, and reserve
the liquid. Drain the canned pears, reserving the syrup. Puree the
pears in a blender or food processor, then add the reserved syrup,
sugar, lime juice and verbena infusion. Pour the mixture into an
ice cream maker, and freeze, following the manufacturer's
instructions.
</P>
<P>
   4. To serve, cut each pear crosswise at the point where the neck
of the pear meets its round belly. Use a melon baller to scoop out
the core in both top and bottom pieces. For each serving, stand the
bottom part of a pear upright in a martini glass or dessert bowl.
Pour some of the blackberry syrup around the pear, then place a
scoop of the sorbet on the pear and set the top of the pear on the
sorbet. Serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS -- Is there a God in Las Vegas? This is a town,
surely, where money is the only true religion, and religious ritual
is more about quickie weddings and divorces than any true
spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   Or is it? Those monumental gambling houses and casinos along the
Strip may look like cathedrals, but in fact the healthiest,
best-observed religion in town is also the most old-fashioned --
that occasionally fusty institution of catechism, rosewater and a
ban on divorces, the Roman Catholic church.
</P>
<P>
   For Vegas, among its many other peculiarities, is the
fastest-growing Catholic diocese in the world. Of the 5,000 new
residents who descend on this frenzied southern Nevada mecca each
month, roughly one-third are Catholic and a few dozen more convert
once they arrive.
</P>
<P>
   The priests of the diocese can't build new churches fast enough
-- five have gone up in the last few years, and another five are
planned for the next 12 months alone. Still the faithful keep
pouring in, causing traffic jams in the churchyard and leaving
standing-room only inside.
</P>
<P>
   At Our Lady of Las Vegas, one of the older parishes in town (it
was founded in 1958), no fewer than eight masses are performed each
Sunday, on top of the two to four on the other days of the week.
</P>
<P>
   And we're not talking a few old ladies sitting politely in the
front rows; the 750-seat church is packed to capacity every time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell this is an older church because these days nobody
would consider building one with less than 1,200 seats,'' explained
the pastor, the Rev. Dave Casaleggio. ``Our neighboring parish has
1,500 seats and still gets swamped. We would build even more
churches than we have, except we can't find the clergy to run
them.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be tempting to see this phenomenal success as some kind
of counterweight to the gambling industry -- God striking back
against Mammon. But in fact it is more to do with Las Vegas'
phenomenal growth and the natural inclination of many Americans to
turn to their church as a source of community spirit and social
life -- particularly when they have just moved to somewhere new.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its long traditions, the Catholic Church is
particularly well placed to provide an anchor for new arrivals from
a huge variety of ethnic backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few people here are from Las Vegas,'' explained Father
Dave. ``The church is what gives them a sense of identity. You
should see the quantity of e-mails I receive from people about to
relocate to this area. They want to know about church activities,
church schools, and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   The casinos do not really enter into the equation. If anything,
the church and the gambling industry co-exist with remarkable ease.
``Once in a while I'll go to a casino and spend 10 or 15 dollars. I
don't think it's a sin, it's fun,'' Father Dave admitted cheerily.
</P>
<P>
   Many casino-owners are themselves Catholic and contribute large
sums both to their parishes and to the community at large. One
Catholic priest in the Las Vegas area has even been known to say
mass in a casino, his liturgy clashing unashamedly with the hoots
and flashing lights of the slot machines.
</P>
<P>
   On closer inspection, churches like Our Lady of Las Vegas appear
to have been infected with some of the same Vegas spirit as the
monster resort hotels on the Strip. When space first became an
issue at Our Lady 10 years ago, the diocesan leaders of the time
chose simply to build a larger church next door -- in much the same
spirit as the owners of the Aladdin casino, who blew up their
property last year to make way for a bigger, better version.
</P>
<P>
   A bit like Caesar's Palace, which boasts a lifesize model of
Michelangelo's David in its shopping arcade, Our Lady of Las Vegas
has a replica -- in marble -- of the Pieta sitting in some
shrubbery overlooking the main road. That's almost as good as the
neighboring parish of Saint Joseph, Husband of Mary, which has a
similarly proportioned Pieta, but in bronze.
</P>
<P>
   There are some limits, however. Divorce is still frowned upon,
and couples wanting to get married in a hurry won't get any joy
from a Catholic priest. Father Dave insists on six months'
preparation, including classes for the bride and groom, or four
months as an absolute minimum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are more liberal around here, it's true,'' he said,
``but we're still the Catholic Church.``

CASTING CHOCOLATE AS SOPHISTICATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By POLLY FROST   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is it possible that there can be too much of something as
perfect as chocolate? Countless writers from cooks to psychologists
have tried to offer the final word on this divine substance.
</P>
<P>
   And even the stodgiest restaurants attempt to outdo each other
with versions of ``death by chocolate,'' which usually turns out to
mean mud cake sludge. Awash in this excess, it can be impossible to
truly appreciate chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   Which is all the more reason to welcome Nick Malgieri's
deliciously sophisticated ``Chocolate: From Simple Cookies to
Extravagant Showstoppers'' (HarperCollins, $35).
</P>
<P>
   Malgieri, the director of baking at the Peter Kump Cooking
School, offers 380 recipes for pies, drinks, custards, sauces,
candies and even blueprints for cookie houses. After a week of
baking, my love affair with the cocoa bean has been renewed.
</P>
<P>
   True chocoholics know that chocolate is a universe of flavors,
textures and pleasures that's as complex as wine or cheese. What's
most rewarding about Malgieri's book is the way he opens back up
the range of what chocolate can do, and then sorts it out for you.
</P>
<P>
   The bittersweet, milk and unsweetened chocolates in his triple
chocolate cheesecake, for example, don't run together, provided you
follow his mixing instructions. Instead, they bring out each
other's characteristics.

<P>
   There's a fine foursquare recipe for chocolate cake with stewed
prunes _ a combination that may strike the modern reader as
strange, but that once wasn't so uncommon. No, it doesn't taste
like a cake that has fallen on top of a hospital breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   The dried fruit beautifully underscores the richness of the
chocolate. And I'm grateful for the recipe for chocolate mayonnaise
cake, something I haven't had since I was a child. ( Malgieri
writes that using mayonnaise this way was an idea thought up 60
years ago by the wife of a grocer.)
</P>
<P>
   It's a light, yet substantial cake, just as I remember, and I
love the way the bitterness of the cocoa begs for a dusting of
confectioners' sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Malgieri also shows that chocolate doesn't always have to be the
diva of the dessert cart. It performs very nicely even in a
supporting role. In his rugelach recipe, Malgieri uses a cream
cheese dough and a filling of brown sugar and cinnamon. Then he
lets fly with the semisweet chips. Yes!
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad that Malgieri's baking instructions are sometimes
sketchier than they should be. One cookie recipe calls for putting
two pans in the oven at the same time, in the upper and lower
thirds of the oven.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't add that you should switch the sheets midway to
insure even baking. After you've made the supernatural brownies, he
asks that you cover them up and leave them alone until the next
day, without explaining why. That's Torture-by-Brownie. The reason,
as I discovered for myself, is that they'll turn into fudgey
melt-in-your mouth bars, and cut better, too.
</P>
<P>
   Beginners who don't own expensive kitchenware will find plenty
within their reach, like the chocolate biscotti. And cooks eager to
stretch their skills will find Malgieri an inspiring coach.
</P>
<P>
   His guidelines for tempering _ the process of melting chocolate
and then cooling it and then reheating it so that it coats smoothly
and seamlessly _ are the least anxiety-producing that I've yet
read. &QL;

   SUPERNATURAL BROWNIES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from ``Chocolate: From Simple Cookies to Extravagant
Showstoppers'' &QL;

and let rest overnight at room temperature or refrigerated.
</P>
<P>
   5. To cut brownies, bring to room temperature, unmold onto a a

<P>
   LAS VEGAS -- Is there a God in Las Vegas? This is a town,
surely, where money is the only true religion, and religious ritual
is more about quickie weddings and divorces than any true
spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   Or is it? Those monumental gambling houses and casinos along the
Strip may look like cathedrals, but in fact the healthiest,
best-observed religion in town is also the most old-fashioned --
that occasionally fusty institution of catechism, rosewater and a
ban on divorces, the Roman Catholic church.
</P>
<P>
   For Vegas, among its many other peculiarities, is the
fastest-growing Catholic diocese in the world. Of the 5,000 new
residents who descend on this frenzied southern Nevada mecca each
month, roughly one-third are Catholic and a few dozen more convert
once they arrive.
</P>
<P>
   The priests of the diocese can't build new churches fast enough
-- five have gone up in the last few years, and another five are
planned for the next 12 months alone. Still the faithful keep
pouring in, causing traffic jams in the churchyard and leaving
standing-room only inside.
</P>
<P>
   At Our Lady of Las Vegas, one of the older parishes in town (it
was founded in 1958), no fewer than eight masses are performed each
Sunday, on top of the two to four on the other days of the week.
</P>
<P>
   And we're not talking a few old ladies sitting politely in the
front rows; the 750-seat church is packed to capacity every time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell this is an older church because these days nobody
would consider building one with less than 1,200 seats,'' explained
the pastor, the Rev. Dave Casaleggio. ``Our neighboring parish has
1,500 seats and still gets swamped. We would build even more
churches than we have, except we can't find the clergy to run
them.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be tempting to see this phenomenal success as some kind
of counterweight to the gambling industry -- God striking back
against Mammon. But in fact it is more to do with Las Vegas'
phenomenal growth and the natural inclination of many Americans to
turn to their church as a source of community spirit and social
life -- particularly when they have just moved to somewhere new.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its long traditions, the Catholic Church is
particularly well placed to provide an anchor for new arrivals from
a huge variety of ethnic backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few people here are from Las Vegas,'' explained Father
Dave. ``The church is what gives them a sense of identity. You
should see the quantity of e-mails I receive from people about to
relocate to this area. They want to know about church activities,
church schools, and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   The casinos do not really enter into the equation. If anything,
the church and the gambling industry co-exist with remarkable ease.
``Once in a while I'll go to a casino and spend 10 or 15 dollars. I
don't think it's a sin, it's fun,'' Father Dave admitted cheerily.
</P>
<P>
   Many casino-owners are themselves Catholic and contribute large
sums both to their parishes and to the community at large. One
Catholic priest in the Las Vegas area has even been known to say
mass in a casino, his liturgy clashing unashamedly with the hoots
and flashing lights of the slot machines.
</P>
<P>
   On closer inspection, churches like Our Lady of Las Vegas appear
to have been infected with some of the same Vegas spirit as the
monster resort hotels on the Strip. When space first became an
issue at Our Lady 10 years ago, the diocesan leaders of the time
chose simply to build a larger church next door -- in much the same
spirit as the owners of the Aladdin casino, who blew up their
property last year to make way for a bigger, better version.
</P>
<P>
   A bit like Caesar's Palace, which boasts a lifesize model of
Michelangelo's David in its shopping arcade, Our Lady of Las Vegas
has a replica -- in marble -- of the Pieta sitting in some
shrubbery overlooking the main road. That's almost as good as the
neighboring parish of Saint Joseph, Husband of Mary, which has a
similarly proportioned Pieta, but in bronze.
</P>
<P>
   There are some limits, however. Divorce is still frowned upon,
and couples wanting to get married in a hurry won't get any joy
from a Catholic priest. Father Dave insists on six months'
preparation, including classes for the bride and groom, or four
months as an absolute minimum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are more liberal around here, it's true,'' he said,
``but we're still the Catholic Church.``

<P>
   Next day, the KGB goons come over to Rabinovitz's house. They
search the shed where the firewood is kept, break every piece of
wood, find no diamonds, swear at Yankel Rabinovitz and leave.

`What'll you have?` he asked.
</P>
<P>
   `Oh, I don't know. The same as you I suppose,` she replied. So,
the husband ordered a couple of Jack Daniel's and threw his down in
one shot.
</P>

   His wife watched him, then took a sip from her glass and
immediately spat it out. `Yuck, that's TERRIBLE!` she spluttered.

   One day Bill Clinton was out jogging-and accidentally fell from
a bridge into a very cold river.
</P>
<P>
   Three boys, playing along the river, saw the accident. Without a
second thought, they jumped in the water and dragged the wet
president out of the river.
</P>
<P>
   After cleaning up he said, `Boys, you saved the President of the
United States today. You deserve a reward. You name it, I'll give
it to you.`
</P>
<P>
   The first boy said, `Please, I'd like a ticket to Disneyland!`
</P>
<P>
   `I'll personally hand it to you,` said Mr. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   `I'd like a pair of Nike Air Turbos,` the second boy said.
</P>
<P>
   `I'll buy them myself and give them to you,` said the grateful

   The Microsoft trial is expected to last about six weeks. Or
about as long as it takes for new computers to become obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   The bad farm economy looks even worse when you remember that
most of us already are doing more than our share of eating up
surplus crops.
</P>
<P>
   New figures show 43.4 million people had no health care
insurance for all of 1997. But at least they didn't get sick
dealing with insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Overheard on our bus: ``If you ask me we should attack
Yugoslavia just for being the source of the Yugo car.''
</P>

   Some 75,000 folks turned out to mark John Paul II's 20th year as
pope. Gee, all that happened when we hit 20 years of column writing
was the man at the next desk asked if he could have the rest of our
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Charles is spending more time with his longtime love,
Camilla Parker Bowles, it's reported. This sounds healthier than
hanging around with, say, inflatable commoners.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election,'' Mr. Clinton says, ``will be determined not
simply by who has the better side of the argument.'' Right. Also
important is who looks cuter on TV.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees scored nine runs in each of the first two World
Series games. Doesn't surprise us. We've always thought of the
Yankees as offensive.
</P>
<P>
   On Middle East negotiations, Mr. Clinton says: ``The issues are
difficult. The distrust is deep. The going has been tough.'' He
sounds like both the Padres' manager and Paula Jones' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Will real peace ever come to the Middle East? We're not sure,
but if it does, can it be spread to the rest of the globe?

   CALIFORNIA -- BART. In what BART officials called a
``disappointing'' level of federal funding, Congress is set to
approve $40 million for BART's extension to the South Bay. The
Clinton administration had requested $74 million, and Burlingame
Mayor Mike Spinelli, a BART opponent, said he thinks the regional
subway system will have to request more money from already-pinched
state and local governments. Stricherz

   The phone rings at KGB headquarters. They answer:
</P>
<P>
   `Hello?`
</P>
<P>
   `Hello, is this KGB?`
</P>
<P>
   `Yes. What do you want?`
</P>
<P>
   `I'm calling to report my neighbor Yankel Rabinovitz as an enemy
of the State. He is hiding undeclared diamonds in his firewood.`
</P>
<P>
   `This will be noted.`
</P>
<P>
   Next day, the KGB goons come over to Rabinovitz's house. They
search the shed where the firewood is kept, break every piece of
wood, find no diamonds, swear at Yankel Rabinovitz and leave.
</P>
<P>
   The phone rings at Rabinovitz's house. He answers, `Hello.`
</P>

   One day, a Mechanical Engineer, Electrical Engineer, Chemical

</P>
<P>
   The car broke down.
</P>
<P>
   The Mechanical Engineer said `I think a rod broke.`
</P>
<P>
   The Chemical Engineer said `The way it sputtered at the end, I
think it's not getting gas.`
</P>
<P>
   The Electrical Engineer said `I think there was a spark and
something is wrong with the electrical system.`
</P>
<P>
   All three turned to the computer engineer and said, `What do you

   A frustrated wife was complaining about her husband spending all

`What'll you have?` he asked.
</P>
<P>
   `Oh, I don't know. The same as you I suppose,` she replied. So,
the husband ordered a couple of Jack Daniel's and threw his down in
one shot.
</P>
<P>
   His wife watched him, then took a sip from her glass and
immediately spat it out. `Yuck, that's TERRIBLE!` she spluttered.
`I don't know how you can drink this stuff!`

<P>
   One day Bill Clinton was out jogging-and accidentally fell from
a bridge into a very cold river.
</P>
<P>
   Three boys, playing along the river, saw the accident. Without a
second thought, they jumped in the water and dragged the wet
president out of the river.
</P>
<P>
   After cleaning up he said, `Boys, you saved the President of the
United States today. You deserve a reward. You name it, I'll give
it to you.`
</P>
<P>
   The first boy said, `Please, I'd like a ticket to Disneyland!`
</P>
<P>
   `I'll personally hand it to you,` said Mr. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   `I'd like a pair of Nike Air Turbos,` the second boy said.
</P>
<P>
   `I'll buy them myself and give them to you,` said the grateful
defender of the Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   `And I'd like a wheelchair with a stereo in it,` said the third
boy.
</P>

 &HT;    REFORM GROUP PRESSES FOR NATIONAL SCHOOL STANDARDS
 &HT;    BY NICHOLE MONROE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nearly 82 percent of American parents think
academic standards at their children's schools are too low, the
Council for Basic Education said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The finding in a nationwide poll by the independent reform group
may reflect the fact that most parents do not have access to model
standards written by national experts, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The council also released a list of what it called the best
educational standards in the country.
</P>
<P>
   President Christopher Cross said it did so to ``open up a
dialogue'' and help school districts, teachers and parents
determine if their academic standards are rigorous enough.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, nearly every state or school district sets its own
academic standards. However, Cross said the guidelines vary widely
and are sometimes too vague.
</P>
<P>
   One state guideline for fourth-grade English, for example, says
students should learn to ``discover language through fun writing
activities.''
</P>
<P>
   The council said a better standard would require specific skills
such as writing narratives, composing responses to literature and
crafting reports that draw from more than one source of
information.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a national set of academic standards has been
criticized by some people who say rigorous standards can hurt
weaker students who already do poorly in school.
</P>
<P>
   However, Cross said most students don't feel they are challenged
enough. He said standards for students in low-performing schools
should be just as high as students in better schools.
</P>
<P>
   According to the poll, nearly three-quarters of parents strongly
believed schools in different parts of the country should have very
similar academic standards.

   NEW YORK _ A menu printed early this century from Luchow's, a
German restaurant that was on East 14th Street, lists Champagne at
$4 a bottle. Books printed in Venice in 1581 and Paris in 1682
illustrate how to disjoint a turkey. And ``Opera Venetia,'' a book
by Bartolomeo Scappi that was printed in 1596, illustrates a fork,
a newfangled tool back then. These items are in ``You Are What You
Read,'' an exhibition at the New York Academy of Medicine, 1216
Fifth Ave. (103rd Street), through Jan. 29.
</P>
<P>
   The books and menu are among 5,000 items given to the academy in
1929 by Margaret Barclay Wilson, who was a professor of physiology
and hygiene at Hunter College, a fellow of the academy and an avid
collector of food books and menus. The earliest printed book on
view dates from 1486. The works are displayed chronologically, with
explanations. The exhibition, in the library on the third floor, is
open weekdays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.

   Chocolate Bar for Peace
</P>
<P>
   Whoever thought that buying a candy bar could lead to world
peace? Ten percent of the price of the Wafa bar, which costs 79
cents to $1, is donated to Seeds of Peace, a nonprofit organization
that educates young people about coexistence. The candy is made by
Arabs and Israelis in a cooperative venture in Israel, and is
distributed by Peaceworks Inc., a Manhattan-based company. An
approximate English translation of ``wafa,'' an Arabic word, is
``fidelity.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for laudatory goals. What does the Wafa bar taste like?
A crisp cookie with hazelnuts and a milk-chocolate coating, it is a
notch above other chocolate bars of this ilk. It is sold at
Zabar's, Broadway and 80th Street, and at Garden of Eden, 314 Third
Ave. (15th Street) and 162 W. 23rd St., among other shops.
</P>
<P>
   Where's the Ham?
</P>
<P>
   Ask an American what beef prosciutto is, and this is the answer
you'd probably get: dried beef sliced paper thin and perhaps served
with figs or melon. But an Italian would be perplexed: In Italian,
``prosciutto'' means ``ham,'' any ham, not just the air-cured kind
from Parma. Beef ham?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there is such a thing. Positively gourmet-brand beef
prosciutto, made from lean Argentine top round, is being introduced
this week in New York shops. It is pleasant and very mild, with
neither the salty intensity of other dried beef products, like
Italian bresaola or Swiss buendnerfleisch, nor the sweet nutty
complexity of Italian prosciutto di Parma. It has almost no fat and
is relatively low in sodium, with 50 calories and 290 milligrams of
sodium in a one-ounce serving. It is cured for 90 days and contains
potassium nitrate and sodium ascorbate.
</P>
<P>
   The product, made by Beef Prosciutto, a company in Jupiter,
Fla., is about $20 a pound at Murray's Cheese Shop, 257 Bleecker
St. (Cornelia Street); Fairway, 2127 Broadway (74th Street) and
2328 12th Ave. (132nd Street); Grace's Marketplace, 1237 Third Ave.
(71st Street), and Agata &AMP; Valentina, 1505 First Ave. (79th
Street). It is also at Citarella, 2135 Broadway (75th Street) and
1313 Third Ave. (75th Street); both Citarella locations will serve
samples this Saturday and on Nov. 7 and 14, from 1 to 5 p.m.

SLUGGING IT OUT IN THE RATINGS

<P>
   Who is getting more air time during the World Series? Stars of
the Yankees or stars of Fox?
</P>
<P>
   Call it a tie. But Fox, like other networks before it, believes
it can only help to show off its stars in the stands at famed
temples of baseball like Yankees Stadium, or Qualcomm Stadium in
San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night Fox is even trying to squeeze some promotional
value out of the national anthem. Lisa Nicole Carson of ``Ally
McBeal'' is singing it before the game. The anthem is not
automatically part of the pregame festivities in a network's
coverage, but Fox will arrange the schedule to get Ms. Carson's
performance in front of the big prime-time audience.
</P>
<P>
   Promoting stars and shows is one way a network tries to get its
money's worth from the millions of dollars it spends to acquire the
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday Fox executives were feeling as if they got some extra
bounce for Monday's episode of ``Ally McBeal,'' which scored the
highest rating in the show's history in the country's 40 biggest
cities. Could it have helped just a little that the World Series
games played over the weekend included a promotion for the show
featuring Calista Flockhart's Ally, in a fantasy sequence, leaping
onto a guest star, John Ritter, and wrapping her micro-miniskirted
legs around his head?
</P>
<P>
   The World Series has helped Fox to its best ratings of the
season, though the network still finished behind both NBC and CBS.
NBC, despite a sizeable falloff in its Thursday-night lineup, still
easily led the other networks in every ratings category, from total
viewers to young-adult viewers. (Viewership for the World Series,
by the way, was down 4 percent from last year for the first two
games.)
</P>
<P>
   Much of Fox's promotion during the games is devoted to the
network's shows lined up for the November rating sweep, which
begins on Oct. 29. Fox hopes to create enormous anticipation for
events like the first television showing of ``Jurassic Park II: The
Lost World'' on Nov. 1 and the season premiere of ``The X-Files''
on Nov. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Those two Sundays are shaping up as the biggest showdowns of the
sweep month. On the night of Nov. 1, for example, NBC is countering
dinosaurs with soul music with the first part of a mini-series
about the career of the Temptations, while ABC is offering a potent
movie double-header with ``101 Dalmatians'' at 7 and the Oprah
Winfrey-produced remake of ``David and Lisa'' at 9.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 8, against the return of Mulder and Scully on ``The
X-Files,'' CBS is bringing out its sequel to ``Roots,'' called
``Mama Flora's Family,'' and NBC is reuniting Chris Noth with
characters from ``Law and Order,'' playing his old role of
Detective Mike Logan in a movie called ``Exiled.''

</P>
<P>
   To most Americans, market news once meant hikes in hamburger
prices. Now, the market means first and foremost the stock market,
and viewers are following it more closely than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence? On Monday, CNN will more than double the number of
stock market updates that it carries from its financial-news sister
channel, CNNfn, to 19 a day from 9. The two-minute updates will run
twice an hour on CNN from 8:15 a.m. until 4:15 p.m., as well as a
report at 7:30 a.m. and a wrap-up at 6:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Also, CNN has begun carrying a corner-of-the-screen graphic
updating Dow Jones and NASDAQ stock market averages all day. The
Fox News Channel carries those two and the Standard &AMP; Poor Index.
MSNBC carries the Dow only.
</P>
<P>
   Since CNN's ``Moneyline News Hour,'' with Lou Dobbs as anchor,
expanded to a full hour from a half-hour last June, its Nielsen
ratings have increased 20 percent, to an average of 420,000
households daily.
</P>
<P>
   And CNBC, the business-news cable channel owned by NBC and
operated with Dow Jones, has seen its average Nielsen ratings swell
to 80 percent higher this fall than at the same time last year.
</P>
<P>
   CNBC has been adding layman-friendly features like a ``ticker
guide'' explaining how to read the stock-market ticker and primers
on understanding mutual funds; the network is also preparing a
glossary of financial terms for its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simple reason is that people are now managing their
retirement funds through what's called a 401(k) plan,'' said Bill
Bolster, president of CNBC. ``So people at the $75,000 income or
asset level get involved, and are interested in various company's
profits.''
</P>
<P>
   Dobbs of ``Moneyline'' also points out that the most important
news stories today are often about economics. ``Most engagements
globally now are economic rather than political or military,'' he
said. ``Economics is not just a market story; it's a social
story.''
</P>
<P>
   As the market falls, business-news viewership rises: CNBC hit
its highest level ever on Aug. 31, the day the Dow Jones industrial
average dropped 512 points. That day one million households tuned
in to CNBC's ``Market Wrap,'' a number that does not include
out-of-home viewing in offices, and an average of 440,000 homes
tuned in between 5 a.m. and 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   During market hours, 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m., CNBC's average in
September was 382,000 households, an increase of almost 100 percent
from September 1997. For CNNfn, the going is tougher because it
reaches only 10 million homes, while CNN is in more than 75 million
homes and CNBC in more than 65 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once, we could neatly define stories as consumer or business,
finance or market,'' said Dobbs, who is also president of CNNfn.
``They are inextricably entwined now _ in reality and also in the
understanding of most viewers or readers.''

`SLAM' AN UPLIFTING TWIST   O N TOUGH - STREETS STORY   LINE
</HEADLINE>
 OUR RATING: 3 Stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Slam'' takes the urban drama in a strange but
pleasing new direction. Uplifting, if not entirely convincing, it
runs on sheer, committed emotion. That alone is a refreshing change
from the fatalism that permeates most films about the inner city.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Slam's'' most distinctive element also makes it an
oddity. The title refers to an energetic form of performance
poetry, engaged with social and racial issues and delivered in an
impassioned, melodramatic style. Not surprisingly, the movie's two
leads, Saul Williams and Sonja Sohn, are both competition winners
on the slam poetry circuit. They've got star quality, but they're
not quite ready for movie stardom.
</P>
<P>
   Like sports in a number of ghetto problem films, poetry here is
held up as a route away from the despair and the violence. But this
is no simplistic, ``Fame''-like fable that just substitutes
performance of one kind for another; no one suggests here that
spoken word is going to be anybody's ticket out of poverty.
``Slam's'' point that personal growth comes through reflective
creative expression, however, is persuasively made.
</P>
<P>
   Williams plays Raymond Joshua, an affable small-time drug dealer
in D.C.'s tough Dodge City district. When his connection and
protector is hit bad in an ambush, Joshua is busted on a minor drug
charge by desperate cops. Thrust into the District's horrendous
criminal justice system (bad-example Mayor Marion Barry has an
amusing cameo as a ``teach 'em a lesson'' judge), Joshua is
threatened and pressured to take sides with a gang faction.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his facility for rhyming impresses belligerent inmates
enough to keep Joshua out of danger. It also impresses a comely
volunteer writing instructor, Lauren Bell (Sohn), who's devoted to
teaching the guys self-esteem through self-revelation. When Joshua
gets bailed out, he makes a beeline for the appreciative Bell.
</P>
<P>
   But will the judge and jury he'll have to face be as moved by
Joshua's poetic flights?
</P>
<P>
   Directed by documentary veteran Marc Levin from a script which
many of the actors contributed to _ including the ex-con turned
columnist Bonz Malone, who plays a particularly enlightened
jailhouse ganglord _ much of the movie was filmed inside the actual
D.C. lockup, with real prisoners appearing in many scenes. It's an
understatement to say that the thing has realistic background
texture.
</P>
<P>
   It's the foreground that occasionally gets out of sync. Williams
has a smoldering magneticism in his quieter scenes, a stillness
that radiates both thoughtfulness and hurt. And when he's rhyming
out, there's an electric command and power in his well-matched
words and gestures.
</P>
<P>
   When he plays a highly emotional scene straight, however,
Williams inevitably gets too shrill _ there is no degree or nuance
to his righteous, worried anger. Sohn has similar strengths and
weaknesses as an actress, compounded by the fact that her character
is stuck with the film's preachiest dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those shortcomings, ``Slam'' is a winning fusion of
gritty staging techniques and growth-potential rhetoric. And the
rhymes are sublime _ much more so than that line could ever
indicate.!end! &QL;

 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    ``Are You Y2K OK?'' So runs this week's ad for National Y2K
Action Week. ``Y2K'' refers to a computer bug -- a programming
problem.
 &HT;    If programmers do not fix billions of lines of code, it is
possible that on Jan. 1, 2000, some of the world's computers will
either fail or issue bad information. Since many public services
and private industries are computerized, Y2K could prove anything
from annoying to disruptive or potentially disastrous. Thus, some
have dubbed this bug the ``millennium bomb.''
 &HT;    For many months, apocalyptic techno-prophets have urged citizens
to stockpile supplies, pull money out of banks and the stock
market, and prepare for disaster. The Internet is ablaze with
end-of-the-world scenarios about, in the words of one, ``The
biggest problem that the modern world has ever faced.''
 &HT;    Among the most hysterical are conservative Christians -- the
folks usually associated with the political religious right.
Christian talk radio, full of anti-Clinton tirades, also
reverberates with Y2K doomsday fears. Pat Robertson's television
program frequently covers Y2K issues and maintains a Y2K Web site.
 &HT;    The Christian Y2K propaganda threatens everything from world
bankruptcy to nuclear disaster.
 &HT;    Quoting computer experts, secular journalists, and the Bible,
these prophets caution: ``Be ready -- even to head for the hills!''
The religious right has been oddly quiet this election year;
perhaps they are too busy stocking supplies in the basement to
vote.
 &HT;    As the world nears the new millennium, I anticipated some
apocalyptic fervor to grip society. After all, Christian societies
have periodically suffered millennial anxiety: around 1000, and
again in the 1300s, the early 1500s, the mid-1800s, and the late
1900s.
 &HT;    Millennial fever is nothing new -- especially in the United
States where various fundamentalist groups have predicted the end
in every decade since the World War II.
 &HT;    What I could not predict, however, was the form this anxiety
would take. With the decline of Soviet communism, all the good
candidates for Antichrist disappeared. No single person or event
seemed powerful enough to plunge us into global crisis. That is, of
course, until Y2K transmuted itself into a (potential)
technological Great Tribulation. What's next? A cyber Antichrist?
 &HT;    While some Christians fear apocalypse, they also use it to their
advantage. Scaring people into heaven is an effective evangelistic
technique -- and an age-old Christian tradition.
 &HT;    From reliefs on medieval cathedrals depicting the fate of the
damned to hellfire-and-brimstone sermons and Halloween ``Judgment
Houses,'' a particular strand of Christianity emphasizes the power
of human fear over divine love. Play on anxieties -- especially
about loss, illness and death -- and people will give money and get
saved.
 &HT;    Few strategies so directly contradict Jesus' teaching. Although
later Christian writers interjected the Gospels with apocalyptic
fears, Jesus himself preached against such concerns. He overtly
resisted attempts to make him an end-of-the-world Messiah.
 &HT;    Instead, he preached on loving God and one's neighbors --
insisting the long-hoped-for millennial kingdom would not come in
glory but as a mustard seed. His kingdom's soil is love -- not
fear.
 &HT;    Don't try telling that to the Y2K prophets. Under the guise of
Christian concern, they are selling salvation through donations and
speaker's fees. Fear is, after all, a robust commodity.
 &HT;    And Y2K? Yes, we -- human beings -- have created an inconvenient
nuisance. Y2K probably will not be a technological Armageddon.
However, no one can really predict what will happen on January 1,
2000.
 &HT;    A colleague of mine recently guessed, ``On that morning, I'll
wake up and the world will be the same as the day before.'' That's
one prediction I'm willing to bet on.

 &HT;    Applewhite is UT's best bet under center
 &HT;    By Kirk Bohls
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Even though the NBA players remain locked out of
their training camps, the first slam dunk of the year comes this
week.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Texas football coach Mack Brown must decide whether
to keep redshirt freshman Major Applewhite or bring back fifth-year
senior Richard Walton as his starting quarterback against Baylor on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Logic, common sense and proper attention to the future, as well
as the last four games, dictate that Applewhite takes the first
snap, as I believe he will. The upside is too great to do anything
else. That should not be construed as a slap at Walton, who it says
here can produce numbers _ and maybe even won-lost records _
similar to those of his previous understudy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it's just a tremendous vote of confidence for a
freckle-faced rookie with uncanny accuracy, great touch on the deep
ball, poise beyond his years and a perpetual deadpan expression on
his boyish face.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Walton has yet to prove he is 100 percent recovered
from the broken finger in his right hand, and he has had lingering
soreness in his wrist and forearm. Walton deserves to be treated
with respect for his loyalty to the program and his abilities and
should be given every chance to wrest the job from Applewhite.
Until he does so in practice or Applewhite falters on game day,
though, Walton will have to contribute as a reserve this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of fans get excited any time there is a quarterback
controversy,'' Brown said playfully. ``It's like a dog around raw
meat. This is good stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he and offensive coordinator Greg Davis will make the
``hard decision'' at some point this week and will base their final
choice on what's best for the team. That should be the sole factor
behind the decision.
</P>
<P>
   I've never been one to agree with coaches who automatically
return the quarterback's job to an injured incumbent once he
recovers. Minnesota's Randall Cunningham has replaced Brad Johnson
and thrown 12 touchdown passes without a single interception, but
Vikings Coach Dennis Green vows to put Johnson under center when
he's healthy. HELLO _ if Johnson were Brett Favre, that idea might
have some merit.
</P>
<P>
   Few will second-guess Chan Gailey for removing Jason Garrett for
a mended Troy Aikman, Garrett's 3-2 record notwithstanding. And if
Walton were, say, a more proven James Brown, then the decision
becomes harder.
</P>
<P>
   Some say Mack Brown should give the job back to Walton _ who
started the first two games _ to properly reward the veteran who
has paid his dues or risk sending a wrong message to other players.
However, doing that would send a wrong signal to the quarterbacks'
teammates. To start anyone other than the best player for the
position is to do a disservice to every player who busts his tail
Monday through Friday to work his way up the depth chart.
</P>
<P>
   Walton is a good quarterback with a 2-2 record in four career
starts and five games of eligibility remaining. Applewhite is a
good quarterback who has led Texas to a 3-1 record and has three
years of eligibility left after this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started our comeback against UCLA with Richard, and he had
a great third quarter,'' Brown said. ``We scored 66 points in the
opener with him. They're not two bad players.''
</P>
<P>
   At his weekly press conference Monday, Brown even took an
informal poll of 16 sportswriters. Fifteen voted to keep Applewhite
as the starter, with one abstention.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite brings big-time instincts, a big-enough arm and a
big-game presence without having grown a big head. Even though he
ranks 17th nationally in pass efficiency after four consecutive
200-yard passing games, he'd give himself ``probably a C'' for a
midseason grade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just average,'' he said. ``Not outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, Major. You haven't done one thing remotely average. Since
Applewhite, as a high school junior, first noticed Walton and his
strong arm during warmups for the 1996 Sugar Bowl, he has looked up
to Walton. If ever two people could co-exist at this one
high-profile position, it's Applewhite and Walton. Both are classy,
up-front players who put their team above personal goals and
rewards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not be mad if Richard was the starting quarterback,''
Applewhite said. ``I'd be more than glad to take the second-team
role for this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Barring an unlikely scenario, he won't have to.

   IRELAND-HUME _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ About 15 years ago, John
Hume _ who last week won the Nobel Peace Prize _ built a little
stone cottage on a spit of land overlooking the River Foyle in
Donegal, just a few miles over the Northern Ireland border. The
chances of his being assassinated were somewhat diminished on this
remote and windswept promontory. Hume liked to sit in his yard and
watch ships ply the Foyle on their way to and from Derry. He smoked
too many cigarettes while he stared out to sea. I sat with him in
his yard a few times. He told me more than once that this was the
last bit of Ireland seen by emigrants as they sailed to America and
Canada. How sad, he would say, that after almost everybody was
driven out of Ireland, those few who remained took to killing each
other. (Reid, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

Atlanta, Mayor Bill Campbell said Monday, ``Interestingly enough,
there were tens of thousands of people in downtown for the Saints
game with the Falcons, or just coming to enjoy a pleasant weekend
in Atlanta. I don't think any of them saw or heard, or felt unsafe
while they were here. This tragedy is, I think, an individual act
that must be seen in that context.'' Maybe some of those thousands
coming for the next Falcons game will feel a bit more unsafe now
that it turns out three men who came to town for the Falcons game
were shot in the head. Following reaction of downtown businesses
and hotel industry. (Charles/Campos, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   STATEHOUSE _ Amid this lackluster year for federal campaigns,
the most aggressive and hard-fought battles are being waged in
state Capitols around the nation, particularly in the South.
Republicans and Democrats are battling for control of legislative
chambers from North Carolina to Georgia to Texas. The fierce
competition is an extension of the transformation that swept
Congress in the early 1990s, when Republicans gained control of
most of the Congressional delegations in the South. The off year
elections unfold in the shadow of the 2000 census, making
statehouse races _ and the 36 governors' races _ especially
important since the ground is being laid for the 2001
reapportionment. (Foskett, Atlanta Journal-Constiution). 30. WITH

   SIERRA _ After more than a decade, three state officials will
decide Thursday whether to grant an operating permit for a
low-level nuclear waste disposal site near the tiny town of Sierra
Blanca in West Texas. What factors will the Texas Natural Resource
Conservation Commission consider in making its decision? Story will
pay particular attention to the geology of the site and the
socioeconomics of the region, two objections raised by
administrative law judges in their recommendation to deny the
permit. What's at stake? How did we get to the point, and what's
the next step? (Haurwitz, Austin American-Statesman). WITH PHOTOS.

without the bickering reminiscent of the old-time, name-calling
contests that years ago were an election-year staple in Texas, both

created 161 years ago when Texas was still a republic. Here's a
look at the two men who want the job. (Ward, Austin

<P>
   LONDON _ Eight years ago, some time after a large chunk of lead
broke off its top and tumbled to the ground, the crumbling Albert
Memorial was swathed in an ignominious wrapping.
</P>
<P>
   The strange thing was, a lot of people liked it better that way.
Some compared the new-look monument to a Christo installation. ``It
looks like a diminutive skyscraper and has a nice simple shape, a
sculptural character,'' Michael Manser, a former president of the
Royal Institute of British Architects, said approvingly in 1993.
``The light falls on it in rather an extraordinary way.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the scaffolding is coming off. After a four-year $18.7
million overhaul involving more than 100 artisans and craftsman,
the 200-foot-high monument, an expression of the widowed Queen
Victoria's endless love for her dead husband, Prince Albert, and
Britain's most elaborate example of high Victorian neo-Gothic
architecture, is to be unveiled again to the public, its final
wrapping removed after a slow striptease over the past six months.
</P>
<P>
   At a grand sound-and-light show in Kensington Gardens on
Wednesday, Albert's great-great-granddaughter, Queen Elizabeth,
will formally reopen the monument, throwing her full support behind
a structure that the 19th-century philosopher R.G. Collingwood once
called ``visibly misshapen, corrupt, crawling, verminous'' and has
been dogged by extremes of opinion ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is England's Taj Mahal,'' said the architect Alasdair
Glass, who has devoted 10 years to the restoration as English
Heritage's project manager for the Memorial. Glass compares it to
the monument built by the emperor Shah Jahan as a memorial to his
wife: ``It's the most magnificent monument in the world to a
concubine who wasn't female,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Bayley, a design expert and the author of a book on the
memorial, said: ``In its vulgarity and absurdity, there's something
deeply touching about it. It's a monument to a much more innocent
age.''
</P>
<P>
   It was by no means certain that the monument would even be
restored. Always at the mercy of vicissitudes _ some eras have
appreciated Gothic architecture more than others _ the monument
went deeply out of favor during World War I.
</P>
<P>
   In 1915, the gilding on the enormous statue of Albert in the
monument's center was stripped away, ostensibly so it wouldn't
glint and provide a target for enemy fire, but probably because the
German-born Albert was none too popular at the time. Deprived of
its shiny coating and covered with protective sheep's grease, the
statue turned an ugly greenish shade. During World War II, the
monument was hit by friendly fire, and repaired only shoddily.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, original flaws in the design were becoming more and
more worrisome. The memorial's builders had used a lethal
combination of lead and cast-iron that encouraged leaks and caused
the lead to crack and the iron to expand, letting more water in. By
the time the lead fragment fell off eight years ago, the public was
already used to seeing the ground littered with little pieces of
the intricate Venetian mosaics at the top of the monument.
</P>
<P>
   The refurbishment has been painstaking, involving, for starters,
hundreds of sheets of 23{-carat, double-weight gold leaf, which
have restored the 12-ton, 25-foot-high statue of Albert to its
original glittering splendor.
</P>
<P>
   Sculptors have replaced broken fingers and noses that had broken
off from the figures of artists and architects depicted around the
monument's base. Engineers have worked to restore its structural
stability. And the exercise has given the country a chance to
revisit the history of Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, the hardworking
German cousin who won Queen Victoria's heart and became not only
her consort but the real power behind the throne.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Albert was only 42 when he died of typhoid fever
contracted after a late-night trip in the cold in 1861 to chastise
one of his sons over his uncouth behavior. His heartbroken widow
plunged into deep mourning and wore black for the rest of her days.
The nation, meanwhile, stricken with remorse over its sometimes
unkind treatment of Albert in life, decided to make it up to him in
death.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Memorials began to spring up like mushrooms: more than 25
free-standing statues of the late prince were built, in cities
across the country. In London, it was decided that the definitive
monument would be placed in Kensington Gardens, near the site of
the 1851 Great Exhibition of Works of Industry of All Nations,
which Albert had organized with great success.
</P>
<P>
   The architectural competition to design the memorial was won by
Sir George Gilbert Scott, Britain's leading Victorian neo-Gothic
revivalist and a passionate acolyte of Augustus Pugin who was
yearning to build a Pugin-like structure of his own. ``I was
awakened from my slumber by the thunder of Pugin's writings,'' he
once wrote.
</P>
<P>
   As a monument to the dead prince, Scott's structure was designed
to celebrate Albert's belief in progress and his catholic
interests, which extended to art, architecture, sculpture,
agriculture, manufacturing and the industrial arts. This was
achieved by the inclusion of elaborate allegorical statues
portraying agriculture and the like and by an extraordinary marble
frieze at the base of the monument.
</P>
<P>
   The frieze depicts, in relief, some 169 figures from the Western
cultural tradition, including such writers as Homer and
Shakespeare, painters like Duerer and Stephen of Cologne, and a
slew of architects, from Cheops, who built the Great Pyramid at
Giza, to Pugin himself, whose frieze appears in front of a modest
profile of Scott, the only living person in the series (Victoria
demanded that he be included).
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as an expression of Victorian England's view of its
central position relative to the rest of the world, the monument
was meant to show the nation at the height of her powers and in all
her glory, rising above places like the Americas (represented by a
buffalo and a group of semiclad figures, one of them wearing a
feather headdress).
</P>
<P>
   As a Gothic temple, it was to be the biggest, busiest, most
elaborate memorial the country had ever seen, heaving with
symbolism, a multicolored combination of polished stone, gilded
metalwork, Italian marble, mosaics and glass jewels towering into
the sky. What Scott wanted, he said, was to use the miniature
medieval shrines and reliquaries of the churches of Continental
Europe as starting points, expanding them on an enormous scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing is blown-up jewelry on a gigantic scale,''
said Glass. ``It really ought to be two feet high.''
</P>
<P>
   When the statue was built, at a total cost in those days of
about 150,000 pounds (the queen paid for half of the 6,000-pound
Statue of Albert herself), it was declared a worthy monument to a
man more appreciated in death than in life (except by his wife).
The queen, admittedly biased, declared it ``really magnificent.''
Today, most Britons seem fond of the monument, as a historical icon
and a symbol of a past that can never be recreated.
</P>
<P>
   ``British Victorian civilization was absurd in the purest sense,
and this is an absurd monument to it,'' Bayley said. Although the
memorial is a ``gigantic work of Victorian schmaltz,'' wrote Rowan
Moore, The Evening Standard's architecture critic, in a recent
appreciation of the monument, that is beside the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main point of the Albert Memorial,'' he declared, ``is
that, in a supposedly buttoned-up, hardheaded century, such an
excessive, preposterous but also impressive monument to love and
grief could have been built in a public place. It is a British Taj
Mahal, even if it's a Taj Mahal in dubious taste.''

ITALY: WHERE EVERY MEAL IS A FABULOUS FEAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RUTH REICHL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no bad food in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   That may be an exaggeration, but after three weeks of traveling
there, I have come to believe it is true. In small towns and big
cities, in tiny trattorias and even tourist restaurants, we ate
well everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   It was not what I expected. When I told friends I was heading to
Italy in the month of August they were all incredulous. August,
they assured me, was a stupid time to go. The whole country would
be closed; the place would be packed with tourists. Indeed, my best
Italian friend was planning to spend the month in Bali.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care,'' I said. Defiantly, I did not take a single
restaurant guidebook and made no reservations. We would eat
wherever we happened to be when we got hungry; if we ate badly for
a few weeks we would certainly survive.
</P>
<P>
   I have learned, the hard way, that you can no longer count on
serendipity in France; although it is still home to many of the
world's greatest restaurants, if you leave your meals to chance,
you may end up eating terribly. I expected Italy to be the same.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not. Italy is still what France used to be: a
fabulous feast, a place where good food is always just around the
corner.
</P>
<P>
   We started out in a rented house in Umbria, the pastoral region
just south of Tuscany. The brochure had made it sound so splendid
that I had allowed myself to fantasize an elegant palazzo high on a
hill.
</P>
<P>
   There was a hill all right, and the house was very pretty,
surrounded by fruit and olive trees, with an extraordinary view.
There was a pool and a large outdoor oven. The romance, however,
ended at the gate _ the town beyond it was a jumble of ugly new
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   It took awhile to find a grocery store, but we finally
discovered that the supermarket was in the middle of the housing
project near the railroad station. It did not look promising. When
the electric doors opened I nearly gasped: the shelves were lined
with artisanal pastas, the cheese and prosciutto looked terrific,
the butcher was friendly, and the fruits and vegetables that winked
and glistened beneath the fluorescent lights were as fresh as
anything you find in New York's Greenmarkets.
</P>
<P>
   I bought melons and prosciutto, I bought an entire loin of pork,
I bought local potatoes, tomatoes and arugula. Our first dinner,
cooked in the outdoor oven, was splendid.
</P>
<P>
   The next day I headed for Narni, a nearby hill town that seems
to have been slumbering since the 12th century. Cobbled streets
twisted up to the fortress at the top of the village and the
morning market was in a covered loggia. Everything _ from the
melons casually tossing their fragrance into the air to the glowing
peaches _ were at the perfect point of ripeness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where should we eat?'' I asked the old lady who sold us figs.
She pointed a gnarled finger up the hill to the Hotel dei Priori,
where we had a wonderful lunch on the terrace of manfrigoli, the
thick square-cut strands of local pasta, with a fresh wine that
tasted like cherries.
</P>
<P>
   And so it went, everywhere. Italians still eat simply, locally
and very well. It is telling, I think, that in two weeks in Umbria
I did not stumble upon a single McDonald's. I did, however, stumble
upon a great many unforgettable meals.
</P>
<P>
   In Todi, desperately trying to find a place to park, I got stuck
at the end of a cobbled dead-end street. As I tried to back up the
45-degree incline, the car stalled. The proprietor of the nearest
restaurant watched me, shook his head and then motioned for me to
get out of the car. He backed it all the way up to the top of the
street and handed it back, without a word. The least I could do, I
thought, was patronize his restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Ristorante Umbria turned out to have a romantic grape-shaded
terrace overlooking the valley. We ate a thick, powerful soup of
local lentils and sweet little lamb chops grilled over a roaring
fire. It was beautiful there, and by the time I had finished the
better part of a bottle of Orvieto I had gathered the courage to
thank the owner for rescuing me from my car. ``It was nothing,'' he
said graciously. ``But how did you like the food?''
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, in Spoleto, I happened into a small dusty
grocery store with shelves that stretched all the way up to the
ceiling. ``How long has this store been here?'' I asked the
cheerful proprietor. ``Oh,'' he replied, ``since 1620.''
</P>
<P>
   I bought cheese, local salami made of boar, and a bottle of
thick, old balsamic vinegar. ``Is it good?'' I asked. The
proprietor shook his head. ``It's not good,'' he replied. ``It is
extraordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   And so was the restaurant we found in nearby Pigge, on the road
to Assisi. From the outside, the Taverna del Pescatore doesn't look
like much; its beauty unfolds so slowly that it has an almost
magical quality. Bit by bit, you discover a terrace overlooking a
clear stream and then the island in the center of it.
</P>
<P>
   Only when you are seated do you hear the chirping of birds and
the droning of bees. But the moment you open the menu you discover
how truly fortunate you are to be there.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   It is filled with local specialties like strangozzi di magro,
homemade pasta tossed with tomatoes and peppers, and salads of wild
greens topped with smoked trout. Crayfish are steamed simply with
local olive oil and peppers, and goose is cooked with local
chestnuts.
</P>
<P>
   The vegetables come from the garden, the fish from the stream.
But the real treat here is the beef; the local Chianina cattle, fed
on grass, produce lean and flavorful meat.
</P>
<P>
   The wine list is extraordinary, too. And very reasonably priced.
We began with grechetto, a pleasant, light white Umbrian wine that
is perfect in the summer, and went on to a riserva Montefalco
rosso, a powerful red regional wine made from sagrantino,
sangiovese and trebbiano grapes.
</P>
<P>
   Lunch took a long time, and when it was done we lingered in the
shade of the terrace, eating biscotti and fruit and watching
children playing in the water. It was a perfectly languid Umbrian
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   After such peace, Florence was traumatic. It was, as promised,
packed with tourists. And all the famous restaurants, were, as
promised, closed for the month. When I asked a shopkeeper where we
should eat, he said, ``Try Il Latini; tourists seem to like it.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't much of a recommendation, but we were hungry. The
room, with its rustic communal tables set beneath hanging
prosciuttos, was certainly attractive. It was also filled with
Florentines, so when the man on my right asked the waiter for a
recommendation, I leaned in to hear his response.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have the bean soup,'' the waiter said. So I did. It was big,
thick, filling and served with a cruet of good olive oil. It was
impressive. He recommended the veal chop even more highly, and no
wonder; the oven-roasted chop turned out to be the best piece of
veal I had ever tasted.
</P>
<P>
   With a simple salad of greens, tomatoes and the grated carrots
that all Italians seem to put on insalata mista, it made an
extremely satisfying meal.
</P>
<P>
   I had been having amazing luck, but when I got to Venice I
lowered my expectations. I had never eaten particularly well there,
and I certainly did not expect to do so in the height of the
tourist season. But after spending a morning rambling through the
fish market by the Rialto Bridge I was suddenly very hungry. There
was not one fish that was not gorgeous, and I was eager to find a
restaurant that cooked seafood with style.
</P>
<P>
   I went to Corte Sconta, a former working class trattoria. Since
my first visit, 13 years ago, it has become very popular with
Americans. My Venetian friends assured me that it was no longer
very good. They were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   We began with the house appetizer, which arrives in many small
courses. The first consisted of fillets of marinated salmon topped
with chopped arugula and fresh red currants. It was a beautiful
plate, but it tasted even better than it looked. Then there were
steamed vongole verace _ clams so delicious I scooped up every drop
of sauce. They were followed by sardines in saor _ the sweet and
sour sauce that is typical of Venice.
</P>
<P>
   Then the waitress set down freshly picked spider crab, in the
shell, with herbs, olive oil and lemon. And finally, a platter
covered with squid, sea snails, anchovies, octopus, scallops and a
variety of shrimp, from tiny sea crickets to giant gamberi. We went
on to pasta tossed with fresh sardines and a single, exquisitely
grilled sole.
</P>
<P>
   It was my last day, and I felt sated and happy. More than that,
I felt optimistic. Italy is a thoroughly modern country, despite
its government's instability, which has moved forward without
sacrificing all the good things of the past.
</P>
<P>
   At its highest level the country's cuisine is not as imaginative
as that of France, but at every level it is has remained true to
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Italian cooking sticks to its basic principles: You can count on
finding excellent ingredients that are treated with enormous
respect. Sipping my espresso and munching on lemony little biscotti
I thought what a pleasure it was to be in a country where it is
still possible to eat well, without reservations. &QL;

DINING Q&AMP;A: SHRINKING EGG WHITE 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By MELISSA CLARK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My chiffon and sponge cakes occasionally fall while still in
the oven, even if I do not open the door. Why?
</P>
<P>
   Q. I recently made a meringue frosting for a layer cake. A day
later, the frosting began shrinking. By the third day I was down to
a bare cake. What happened?
</P>
<P>
   A. Although these two questions may seem to have little in
common, in each case, the problem was that the beaten egg whites
broke down. When this happens, the air trapped in the mixture is
released, causing it to shrink or fall.
</P>
<P>
   As egg whites are beaten, their proteins, which start out as
tight, irregular coils, begin to unfurl and bond with each other.
Ideally, they link together, forming a loose, flexible network. The
air that is incorporated into the whites through beating gets
trapped by this network and creates that fluffy, white mound.
</P>
<P>
   This cloud is relatively unstable, and there are several reasons
it might deflate. The most likely is overbeating. When egg whites
are overbeaten, the protein network becomes rigid (because the
loose bonds between the proteins strengthen). In the meringue
frosting, the proteins squeezed the liquid from the foam, bursting
the air bubbles and releasing the trapped gas. Hence, the icing
shrank. (Even a perfect meringue frosting will eventually break
down, but overbeating hastens the process.)
</P>
<P>
   A chiffon cake relies on beaten egg whites for leavening. When
it is baked, the gas trapped by the whites expands, which causes
the cake to rise. Overbeaten egg whites, with their firm protein
network, cannot stretch when the gas expands. So the cake either
will not rise at all or will rise only until the brittle protein
network bursts.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it is easy to overbeat egg whites. The idea is to
catch them when they reach their maximum volume, but before they
dry out. To make perfectly beaten egg whites, begin beating with an
electric mixer set on low. As the whites thicken, increase the
speed, and gradually add any sugar. If the recipe calls for cream
of tartar, add it now. (Rose Levy Beranbaum, the author of ``The
Cake Bible,'' advises adding [ teaspoon cream of tartar per egg
white to prevent overbeating.) The whites are ready when they form
shiny peaks as the beaters are lifted. If you tilt the bowl, they
should slip slightly.
</P>
<P>
   If they cling to the bowl, look coarse and clump together,
you've overdone it. Then, just start over.

PAVAROTTI WITHDRAWS FROM `TOSCA' ROLE AT MET 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joseph Volpe, general manager of the Metropolitan
Opera, announced Tuesday that Luciano Pavarotti had withdrawn from
the three performances he was scheduled to sing next month as
Cavaradossi in Puccini's ``Tosca.''
</P>
<P>
   The performances were to be on Nov. 7, Nov. 12 and 16. Volpe
said that Pavarotti still planned to appear in a gala performance
on Nov. 22 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of his debut at the
Met. The tenor Richard Leech will replace Pavarotti in the
Cavaradossi role.
</P>
<P>
   Pavarotti, who underwent major knee and hip surgery in July, is
recuperating at his home in Italy. In recent seasons, physical
problems made him increasingly immobile in performance. The staging
of productions he appeared in, including ``Tosca'' and
``Turandot,'' had to be adjusted because he could not climb stairs
or stand for long periods.
</P>
<P>
   Surgery to correct the problem was long recommended by
Pavarotti's doctors, according to his manager, Herbert Breslin. But
to recover fully, Pavarotti needed to lose some weight, which
proved to be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is over,'' Breslin said Tuesday. ``He has finally
taken care of something he has suffered with for many, many years,
and he has made incredible progress. He is normally not the person
who is going to sit up every day and start doing physical therapy.
But he has. He is determined.''
</P>
<P>
   His first performance since the surgery came in a concert last
week before an audience of 18,000 at an arena in Cologne. But
Pavarotti's doctors believe he needs two or three more weeks of
physical therapy before he will be able to walk comfortably onstage
in an operatic performance, Volpe said.
</P>
<P>
   The 30th-anniversary gala will present Pavarotti in Act III of
Puccini's ``Boheme'' (with soprano Daniela Dessi), Act II of
Donizetti's ``Elisir d'Amore'' (with soprano Ruth Ann Swenson), and
Act IV of Verdi's ``Aida'' (with soprano Aprile Millo).

OPPOSITION SEES LITTLE CHANCE OF WINNING IN MEXICAN STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PHILIP TRUE  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A leader of the center-left Democratic Revolution
Party, or PRD, virtually conceded defeat Tuesday in the
gubernatorial election scheduled Sunday in the northeastern state
of Tamaulipas.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Ortega Martinez, national secretary-general of the party,
said the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, has
employed a high-rolling strategy of lavish spending for the
campaign of its candidate, Tomas Yarrington Ruvalcaba.
</P>
<P>
   And Ortega accused the PRI of using state-owned vehicles to give
away food, medicines and building materials in Yarrington's name to
influence voters.
</P>
<P>
   Yarrington said in a recent interview that he had heard rumors
about the alleged food giveaways, and he denied the charges made by
the PRD, dismissing them as dirty politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are obviously at a disadvantage,'' Ortega said at a news
conference at party headquarters here. ``But we do expect to obtain
a good showing for our party.''
</P>
<P>
   Joaquin Hernandez Correa is the PRD candidate for governor.
Besides Yarrington, the other principal candidate is Gustavo
Cardenas Gutierrez, from the center-right National Action Party, or
PAN.
</P>
<P>
   A poll released by the University of Guadalajara last week
showed Yarrington leading Cardenas 56 percent to 18 percent, with
Hernandez at a distant 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Tamaulipas is now governed by the PRI's Manuel Cavazos Lerma. He
is barred by law from running for another term.
</P>
<P>
   Ortega said his party is at a disadvantage because state
vehicles are used to pass out cooking oil, beans and rice, and
building materials to the state's desperately poor residents. Such
practices violate Mexican campaign laws.
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders in Tamaulipas have allegedly uncovered at least
two warehouses where such supplies are kept, and two weeks ago, a
state-owned truck in the southern port city of Altamira was
discovered carrying giveaway food and Yarrington campaign
literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is what we know about, you can imagine what they are
doing all over the state,'' Ortega said.
</P>
<P>
   Ortega said the party would file charges with the Mexican
federal attorney general's office based on the discoveries, and
called for PRI candidates in areas where such irregularities occur
to be removed from the ballot.

CLINTON TO ATTEND GLENN'S LIFTOFF ABOARD DISCOVERY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN DRAKE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will travel to Cape Canaveral
next week for the scheduled liftoff of the shuttle Discovery with
Sen. John Glenn aboard, but his presence shouldn't add any
additional pressure to have a launch, NASA officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants ``to recognize Sen. Glenn's historic return to
space and to recognize the importance of our nation's space program
and the hard work of the men and women that make that program
possible,'' Joe Lockhart, White House press secretary, said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio senator, who is retiring this year, was also a key
congressional ally, defending Clinton and other Democrats during
hearings about the 1996 campaign fund-raising scandals.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the president's presence might put pressure on
mission managers to stretch safety guidelines to ensure liftoff,
Seymour Himmel, a member of NASA's Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel
replied: ``No way. It's going to be within the boundaries that are
allowed or it ain't going to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The only time a U.S. president has watched a launch was when
President Nixon witnessed the takeoff in 1969 of Apollo 12. The
rocket was struck by lightning twice as it passed through storm
clouds after liftoff.
</P>
<P>
   After his stop at Cape Canaveral on Oct. 29, the president will
attend a fund-raising reception for Congressman Peter Deutsch and
Lt. Gov. Buddy McKay, in West Palm Beach. He will return to
Washington late that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'd have to dig really deep to find something wrong
with the president going down and celebrating this great
achievement, both for NASA and for Sen. Glenn,'' Lockhart said. &QL;

NEWLY BOUGHT KACD-FM ADOPTS TRIPLE-A FORMAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The album alternative format of beloved but
defunct KSCA-FM is back with a different name and a new home on the
dial.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, dance-oriented Groove 103.1 flipped formats Monday
afternoon to triple-A (adult album alternative), with ex-KSCA music
head Nicole Sandler plotting the playlist.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Monica station, KACD-FM (103.1) _ now known as Channel
103.1 _ will operate without disc jockeys while a nationwide hunt
continues for air talent and a music-intensive morning show,
Sandler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking to lots of people, the best in the biz from
around the country,'' she said, adding that new KACD owner,
Kentucky-based Jacor Communications, promises a long-term
commitment to album alternative in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This format needed to be back on the air in L.A.,'' said David
Benson, KACD's acting program director.
</P>
<P>
   Benson also programs Denver's heritage triple-A outlet KBCO-FM,
which recently placed third in the market in the sought-after
25-to-54 demographic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intent is to have a lot more variety and lot less
repetition for the kind of artist that has become more mainstream
since KSCA went off the air,'' Benson said.
</P>
<P>
   KSCA ceased broadcasting Feb. 4, 1997. Since then, other local
adult-oriented stations like Star 98 have picked up some of the
format's core artists, including Natalie Merchant, Sheryl Crow and
Sarah McLachlan.
</P>
<P>
   Benson said KACD's playlist will be broader, ranging from Bob
Marley to R.E.M. to Lucinda Williams and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're calling it `wall-to-wall world-class rock,''' Benson
said. ``We're in the process of building a music library, so we're
starting out by playing what we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the talent roster is in place, Sandler will helm KACD's
afternoon-drive program from 3 to 8 p.m. The station is also
available over the Internet at www.channel1031.com. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
MORE ON ART BELL
</P>
<P>
   Little has been revealed about the circumstances that drove UFO
aficionado and overnight talk host Art Bell to resign from the
airwaves Oct. 13. But a new announcement from Bell hinted he may
return soon.
</P>
<P>
   Bell's statement at the beginning of a replacement program heard
locally on KABC-AM (790) late Monday again referred to a ``terrible
life-threatening event, which occurred to my family about a year
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Insiders say Bell, 53, left the airwaves to help his young son
through a nonmedical emergency.
</P>
<P>
   The radio host asked listeners to keep him and his family in
their prayers.
</P>
<P>
   Bell's ``Coast to Coast'' syndicated call-in show was broadcast
from a trailer in Pahrump, Nev., about 50 miles from Las Vegas, to
roughly 6.5 million listeners on more than 400 stations.
</P>
<P>
   The program was a kind of ``X-Files'' of the airwaves, focusing
on alien abductions, cattle mutilations and secret government
programs. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SHOW-TUNE TIME
</P>
<P>
   KCSN-FM (88.5) has a new weekly program devoted to show tunes.
``The David &AMP; Peter Show'' is broadcast at 9 p.m. Thursdays. Hosts
David Presby and Peter Goldman created the off-Broadway hit ``431
of My Closest Friends,'' which also ran for eight months in
Hollywood. &QL;

   RUSSIA-SIBERIA (Yakutsk) _ To the Russians crazy enough to live
there, summer in the Siberian Arctic is merely a deep breath before
the next winter, a few weeks of melted ice and midnight sun in
which to gird for the next deep freeze. Either they use those weeks
to haul in enough food and fuel to make it to the next thaw, or
they shiver and starve through the coming months of darkness. It is
easy to call Russia's travails political or fiscal crises. But here
in the Siberian republic of Yakutiya, where a bad debt can condemn
thousands to months of hunger, they can be a matter of survival. By
Michael Wines.

   NY-GAY-MARCHERS (New York) _ For some of the younger marchers
who took to the streets on Monday night to protest the killing of a
homosexual college student in Wyoming, it was their first time in a

return to street protests after a long absence, a chance to revive
the chants of years past and practice the old street skills.

 CHEFS DISCOVER THE GLORIES OF ITALY'S FAR SOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Salvatore Anzalone, the chef at Caffe Bondi in
Manhattan, had a banged-up pan heating on the stove and just six
ingredients in front of him. He reached for one of them _ a few
brown grains that smelled powerfully salty and pungent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the bottarga,'' he said of the cured tuna roe that is
at the heart of true Sicilian cooking.
</P>
<P>
   He sprinkled it into the pan with extra virgin olive oil,
chopped garlic and parsley, then in a matter of seconds, tossed it
with a mound of spaghetti and piled it into a bowl. As a finishing
touch, he scattered bread crumbs, rather than cheese, over the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sicilian cooking is really simple,'' he said. But it is not
plain. The dish was coarse from the bread crumbs, toothsome and
tasted of the sea. It was true Southern Italian cooking and it was
extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   It is no secret that Italian cuisine has experienced a
renaissance in American kitchens over the last decade. But it is
just recently that chefs have turned their attention to the far
regions of the south _ like Puglia, Calabria, Campania, Sicily and
Sardinia _ where the foods are earthy, the flavors are lusty and
the fresh, candid style is a world apart from the heavy monotonous
red sauces familiar in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, raised on the idea that Southern Italian food is all
about dishes like eggplant Parmesan and spaghetti with meatballs,
are about to be enlightened: Genuine Southern Italian food has
finally arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, grocers around the city have begun to stock ingredients
like salted capers, fresh sardines, bucatini and bottarga, and
chefs are placing traditional Southern Italian dishes like
orecchiette with broccoli rape _ and caponata, a sweet and sour
eggplant dish _ prominently on their menus.
</P>
<P>
   It is not entirely new, of course. For generations, there has
been a small underground network of Southern Italians who have
preserved their cuisine by re-creating touches of it here in New
York. Anzalone, whose family is from Ventimiglia in Sicily,
smuggled in wild fennel seeds from Italy so his family could grow
it in their back yard in Brooklyn. (He still uses that wild fennel,
picked from his aunt's back yard, in a pasta dish he serves at
Caffe Bondi on West 20th Street.)
</P>
<P>
   He also smokes his own tuna in the Sicilian style with basil,
mint and lemon peel.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Dora Marzovilla at I Trulli on East 27th Street has
been making traditional Pugliese pasta shapes like ear-shaped
orecchiette and shell-shaped cavatelli by hand for years _ first at
home, and now at the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   And there are countless dedicated home cooks who have been
preserving their own meats, growing vegetables and foraging for
wild greens like broccoli rape and dandelions.
</P>
<P>
   Nicola Marzovilla, Mrs. Marzovilla's son and the owner of I
Trulli, said, ``The cooking in Southern Italy, if there's one
simple way to describe it _ the ingredients are the focal point of
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Southern Italian food was first introduced in America,
its purity was somehow lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came to America in 1963, I found a cuisine I neither
knew nor understood,'' said Tony May, who is from Naples and is the
owner of San Domenico on Central Park South.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of this century, the United States experienced
a great surge of Southern Italian immigrants. Most of them came to
escape impoverished conditions in Southern Italy. When they arrived
here, they got jobs as laborers, they formed closely knit
communities and they tried to preserve the simple cooking they
knew.
</P>
<P>
   But in America, the tomatoes weren't the same. Staples like
sardines, octopus and anchovies were hard to find. Great olive oil
simply wasn't available. So they adjusted, making the most of what
they did have, using inferior tomatoes, replacing broccoli rape
with spinach and making do with fewer herbs.
</P>
<P>
   As the years passed, younger generations, now born in America,
did not have the original cuisine in their memory. Slowly, the
cuisine was reduced to large portions of long-cooked sauces and
bland pastas. The once-light cuisine based on fish and vegetables
was transformed into one based on meat, and heavy on cheese and
garlic. And for decades, Americans believed it to be true Italian
food.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until the 1970s that Americans first began realizing
that there was another cuisine lying beneath the stodgy layers of
veal parmigiano and the everything pizza. Marcella Hazan, whose
book ``The Classic Italian Cookbook'' was published in 1973
(Harper's Magazine Press), gave many Americans their first clue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marcella introduced us to classic Italian food,'' said Nancy
Verde Barr, the author of ``We Called It Macaroni'' (Knopf, 1990).
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Hazan was from Emilia-Romagna, in the north. And in the
north, the cuisine seemed more sophisticated, more elegant and it
had French influences _ which gave it an automatic stamp of
approval in Americans' minds. So the initial rebellion against the
red sauce of the south was fought by exploiting the regional
cuisines of the north.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs put risotto and polenta on their menus and then marched
their way south through the salty and rustic gastronomic terrain of
Tuscany to the real pizzas of Naples.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, determined students of Italian gastronomy and food
writers had dispersed through the countryside, taking copious
notes, seeking out home cooks and tracking down that last
undiscovered spot. They, too, eventually headed south.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, the slow trickle of cookbooks on Southern
Italian cooking has increased to a steady pour. Books on Sicily,
Naples and Puglia have revealed the riches of these neglected
regions. ``Your palate will be richly rewarded by an exploration of
the vast variety of Italian culinary treasures waiting to be found
in Southern Italy,'' wrote Carlo Middione in ``The Food of Southern
Italy'' (William Morrow), which was published in 1987. In the years
that followed, cookbook writers familiarized readers with farro, a
nutty tasting grain, and fregola, a pellet-shaped pasta from
Sardinia, as well as dishes like bread soup; pasta with anchovies,
red pepper flakes and bread crumbs, and spaghetti with fried eggs
and garlic.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Southern Italy also began to recognize its potential in America.
It is a largely poor area, and food producers there did not market
their products or even think to export them. But with improved
transportation and the assistance of newly affluent
Italian-American immigrants, they began to export their products.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all made in an artisanal fashion and they have an
integrity about them,'' said Emily Balducci, a product developer at
Balducci's. She has even imported unusual products like Calabrian
fig syrup, which is used all over the south of Italy on toast and
in cookies. ``It's incredible stuff,'' she said, ``and there are no
preservatives, and it's not exorbitantly expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the products are so integral to the cuisine, some have
become highly sought after. At Urbani Truffles USA Ltd., in Long
Island City, N.Y., sales of bottarga, for instance, have increased
by 50 percent in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   And Eurama Foods Inc., in Brooklyn, which imports Sicilian
products like capers packed in salt from Pantelleria and a
sun-dried tomato extract _ a thick paste that makes commercial
tomato paste seem unpalatable _ has doubled its sales over the last
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Many restaurateurs want to prove just how extraordinary Southern
Italian food can be _ how an ingredient as humble as the fava bean
can be transformed into an ethereal puree, as it is at I Trulli.
</P>
<P>
   Or how the unlikely combination of saffron, pine nuts, currants
and anchovies over bucatini at Caffe Bondi can surprise you by the
range of flavors that can be paired with pasta.
</P>
<P>
   Even in restaurants that aren't specifically Southern Italian,
the influences are palpable.
</P>
<P>
   At Union Square Cafe on East 16th Street, for instance, Michael
Romano, the chef, is enamored with bottarga. He has served it
tossed with spaghetti and bread crumbs. (Bread crumbs are a typical
condiment for pasta in the south where cheese was considered a
luxury.)
</P>
<P>
   And on his current menu, he incorporates bottarga into a
grapefruit salad with fennel, arugula and a lemon vinaigrette. It's
not a Southern Italian dish, but it has the feel of one, with
ingredients that could readily be found there.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Batali, the chef at Babbo, on Waverly Place, prefers to
rely on southern Italian ingredients that may be found here. Then
he designs dishes that are more Southern Italian in spirit than
form. For instance, he sautees tuna steaks medium rare, rather than
well done as they would be in Italy, and serves them with orange
segments, wilted radicchio and a blood orange vinaigrette. It is a
dish with American skin and Southern Italian soul, and it strikes
just the right balance.
</P>
<P>
   Even at Monzu on Mercer Street, which touts itself as a Sicilian
restaurant, Scott Gerow, the chef, tweaks the classics. He makes a
fennel caponata, for example, rather than the traditional eggplant
version.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not making mango caponata,'' Gerow said. ``I mean, we're
still staying sincere to Sicilian tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   As this movement gains strength, the regional differences of the
south will surely become clearer.
</P>
<P>
   For now, only Sicily seems to stand apart in the minds of
Americans. During Sicily's history, which is rich with conflict,
nearly every conquering people _ the Arabs, the French, the Spanish
_ left its stamp on the cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   In Sicilian cooking, couscous, blood oranges, wild fennel,
capers, pungent olives and even exotic spices like saffron all fit
into the intricate culinary fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet and sour flavors are commonly paired, and rich, sweet
desserts like cassata, a layered cake of marzipan, ricotta and
spongecake, are much more refined than the desserts found in other
parts of the south.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps what is so compelling about the south is this confluence
of peasant food and sophisticated cooking. Americans are indeed
taking to it, but the truth is that the door to these cuisines has
merely been cracked.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, America is far from losing its red sauce roots. Even
in New York, Little Italy remains almost entirely untouched; red
sauce practically flows through the veins of its cooks.
</P>
<P>
   And it would be a shame if it were to stop.

   PASTA WITH ANCHOVIES AND BREAD CRUMBS
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from ``Pomp and Sustenance,'' by Mary Taylor Simeti
(Knopf, 1989)
</P>
<P>
   Time: 45 minutes
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup plus 1 1/2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 cups dried bread crumbs, grated from stale bread
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, peeled
</P>
<P>
   \ cup tomato extract (available in specialty food markets) or
1/3 cup tomato paste
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds spaghetti
</P>
<P>
   12 to 14 anchovy fillets packed in oil, drained
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 tablespoons chopped flatleaf parsley.
</P>
<P>
   1. In a large heavy skillet over low heat, heat 1 tablespoon of
the olive oil. Add the bread crumbs, and stir constantly until they
are toasted and golden brown. Transfer to a small serving bowl, and
set aside.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a medium skillet over medium heat, combine 1/3 cup of the
olive oil with the garlic cloves. Saute until lightly browned.
Remove and discard the garlic. Add the tomato extract and 1 cup of
warm water. Stir until the extract is dissolved. Reduce heat to
low, and simmer for 10 minutes. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   3. Fill a large pot 3/4 full of water; salt lightly and bring to
a boil. Add the spaghetti, and cook until al dente, 7 to 9 minutes.
While the spaghetti is cooking, select a skillet large enough to
fit over the top of the pot. Using the skillet as a double boiler,
combine the anchovies and remaining 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil.
Place the pan on top of the spaghetti pot, and stir the anchovies
until they are dissolved and creamy. Remove the skillet and, using
a rubber spatula, scrape the anchovies into the tomato mixture.
Simmer together for 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   4. Reserve 1 cup of the spaghetti cooking water, and set it
aside. Place the spaghetti in a large serving bowl, and top with
the tomato sauce. Mix thoroughly, adding a little of the reserved
liquid if necessary. Sprinkle with the parsley and some of the
bread crumbs. Serve immediately, passing the remaining bread crumbs
on the side.

   TUNA AL TAROCCO
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Babbo
</P>
<P>
   Time: 45 minutes
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup blood-orange juice
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup plus 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 orange
</P>
<P>
   2 scallions, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound wild mushrooms (or a mixture of flavorful cultivated
mushrooms), cut into 1/4-inch slices
</P>
<P>
   Pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 medium head radicchio, cut into 2-inch chunks and the leaves
separated
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons toasted pine nuts
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chopped fennel fronds, or a mixture of parsley and mint
leaves
</P>
<P>
   4 6-to-8-ounce tuna steaks
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper.
</P>
<P>
   1. First make the vinaigrette. In a small pan over high heat,
bring the blood-orange juice to a boil, and reduce by half. Remove
from the heat, and allow to cool.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a small mixing bowl, combine the reduced orange juice,
mustard, vinegar and salt to taste. Whisk to blend, and slowly
whisk in 1/2 cup of the olive oil until emulsified. Set aside.
Grate and reserve the zest from the orange. Cut any remaining peel
and pith from the orange. Over a bowl, cut the orange into
segments, reserving the segments and juices released into the bowl.
</P>
<P>
   3. In a 10-to-12-inch saute pan over high heat, heat 1
tablespoon olive oil, and add the scallions. Saute until the
scallions are softened, 30 to 45 seconds. Add the mushrooms, and
season with salt and pepper to taste. Saute until the mushrooms are
softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the radicchio, orange segments and
any juice. Toss to wilt, 30 to 45 seconds. Transfer to a platter,
and keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   4. In a small bowl, combine the orange zest, pine nuts, and
fennel fronds; set aside. In a 12-inch saute pan over high heat,
heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil until smoking. Season
the tuna steaks with salt and pepper to taste, and add to the pan.
Saute for 4 to 5 minutes, then turn the steaks and saute for
another 2 to 3 minutes, for medium rare. Transfer to the serving
platter, laying the steaks on top of the radicchio mixture.
Sprinkle the blood orange vinaigrette over the steaks, and top with
the orange zest mixture. Serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ If you called Rob Bartlett at the Eugene O'Neill
Theater on Saturday during the matinee of the show he wrote and
starred in, ``More to Love: A Big Fat Comedy,'' you got this
message on his answering machine: ``Hi, it's me. I can't take your
call right now because I'm not in the dressing room, I'm onstage
trying to find a last bit of dignity left. Or I'm somewhere in the
basement of the theater, opening a vein.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason for Bartlett's despondent message was that Saturday's
performances quickly became the last; the show opened on Thursday,
was panned by critics on Friday and closed after the evening
performance on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett's experience seems to be a lesson in the risks of
taking a ride on a new playwright. This fall several unknowns are
seeing their work produced, namely Michael Chepiga and Mark Victor
Olsen, who have plays opening on Broadway, and David Shaber, whose
play is still searching for a home.
</P>
<P>
   Plays by obscure writers open all the time in the many small
theaters around New York City. But it is unusual to see so many
untested authors get a shot at the Great White Way, particularly
given the cost of mounting a Broadway show.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, these are not your typical fresh faces: young, hungry,
starry-eyed. They are mostly middle-aged men, and sometimes older _
Shaber is 68 _ who have regular careers. Bartlett, 41, is a
comedian best known as Don Imus' sidekick on the radio. Chepiga,
whose play, ``Getting and Spending,'' directed by John Tillinger,
opens on Sunday at the Helen Hayes Theater, is a 50-year-old
corporate lawyer. Olsen, whose play ``Cornelia'' is to open
sometime in the spring, directed by Jerry Zaks in a
yet-to-be-determined Broadway house, is a 44-year-old former
corporate lawyer. And Shaber, whose play, ``Second Coming'' is in
search of a theater, has spent 20 years writing screenplays.
</P>
<P>
   So why are producers gambling on these guys? To fill theaters?
Because they're desperate?
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell Maxwell, one of the producers of ``More to Love,'' said
he backed Bartlett because he believed in him _ and still does. And
he insisted there was no cautionary tale in his predicament.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we give up the desire and the passion that's supposed to
fuel the theater by saying, `Oh my God, the last time out I got
bludgeoned to death,' then what do we get?'' he said. ``Disney and
`Beauty and the Beast' and conglomerates who are only interested in
selling merchandise and creating multiple companies for the road.''
</P>
<P>
   One would expect, in this competitive climate, that playwrights
would be positively giddy about having their work produced, on
Broadway, no less. Instead, for nearly all of them, enthusiasm is
clearly tempered by a sober realism; they've been around, and they
know that what happened to Bartlett can happen to them. They say
they hope for the best but sound prepared for the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'm fatalistic in that I think what will be will be,''
said Chepiga, wearing a yellow tie decorated with kites. ``I've had
a good life, a varied life; I love my wife and kids. I could not
foresee the path that this play took, so I have no idea what the
future will bring.''
</P>
<P>
   Chepiga's road to play writing has been particularly circuitous.
He started out planning to become a Franciscan priest, dropped out
to attend Fordham University, taught at Washington Irving High
School in Manhattan and at La Guardia Community College in Long
Island City by day while he got a Ph.D. in English at New York
University at night, then went on to Yale Law School and clerked
for two federal judges in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   For 17 years he has specialized in securities law and mergers
and acquisitions at the firm Simpson Thacher &AMP; Bartlett. He said he
continues to practice not just because he has to but also because
he wants to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so used to juggling both,'' Chepiga said. ``I enjoy it,
and it's never been a question before of doing only writing. It was
something else I did.''
</P>
<P>
   It is his day job that has enabled Chepiga to put two children
through New York City's private schools and to take ski vacations.
In fact, it was on a ski vacation that Chepiga began to write
``Getting and Spending,'' a drama about an investment banker who
goes on trial for insider trading.
</P>
<P>
   As the only member of his family who does not like to ski, he
stayed in the condominium to write. He had spent summers at the
Eugene O'Neill Playwrights Conference in 1978 and 1980, so he had
some idea of what he was doing.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the vacation Chepiga had 13 handwritten pages. He
dropped the project until a year later, during the next ski
vacation. This time he finished the play, and spent the next few
months refining it late at night or on weekends until 1995, when he
submitted it in a play writing competition and won.
</P>
<P>
   The play, shepherded by the producer Martin Markinson, has had
readings in New York and Florida and was produced at the Old Globe
Theater in San Diego over the summer before moving to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Olsen has been working on his play for nine years, ever since he
stumbled on a collection of essays from the 1975-76 presidential
campaign while poking around the public library. It eventually
became ``Cornelia,'' a play about Cornelia Wallace, the second wife
of Gov. George Wallace of Alabama. Olsen said the play paralleled
his own childhood in Oregon and Nebraska in a rigid household.
</P>
<P>
   Having attended the Democratic National Convention at age 15
with the McGovern campaign, Olsen thought he would wind up in
electoral politics, that he would be Oregon's U.S. senator. He
started out as a lawyer but, at age 30, decided to leave law and
move to Latin America, where he spent the next eight years trying
freelance journalism before moving back to New York to write plays.

CONGRESS AND CLINTON ARE SET TO KILL PEANUT RULE ON AIRPLANES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Peanut lovers who fly are among the winners in the
$500 billion spending bill that President Clinton is expected to
sign later this week.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation will crunch a U.S. Department of Transportation
order requiring the nation's 10 largest airlines to provide
peanut-free zones of at least three rows on an aircraft whenever
passengers notify the airline that they suffer from peanut
allergies.
</P>
<P>
   The DOT order in August was inspired by concerns that passengers
with peanut allergies could have adverse reactions to airborne
peanut particles. The order was based on the 1986 Air Carrier
Access Act, a federal law guaranteeing access to airlines for the
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers from peanut-growing states led the move in Congress to
cancel the order.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard C. Shelby, R-Ala., who hails from a
peanut-producing state and chairs the Senate transportation
appropriations subcommittee, led the charge, arguing that a
government order assigning passengers to peanut-friendly or
peanut-free seats ``is not only failing to use common sense, it is
an absolutely ludicrous response to a problem that there is little,
if any, evidence to substantiate its existence.''
</P>
<P>
   The DOT order is one reason ``why so many people have come to
resent and distrust government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation nullifying the DOT order is expected to win
final congressional approval Wednesday and be signed by the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Peanut-allergy sufferers say there is nothing nutty about the
allergies and that they can risk death by ingesting the nuts. A
1996 Mayo Clinic study found that allergens from peanuts can wash
through ventilation system filters and spread around an airplane's
interior.
</P>
<P>
   A peanut reaction can include an itchy mouth, wrists and hands,
swelling, hives, wheezing and a drop in blood pressure and can lead
to death unless a person gets a shot of epinephrine, a drug also
know as adrenaline that rapidly boosts blood pressure and heart
rate, stabilizing the body's vital systems.
</P>
<P>
   They say some can get a reaction by even smelling peanut protein
in the air.
</P>
<P>
   But the American Peanut Council in Alexandria, Va., says that
the idea of creating peanut-free zones was ``really an absurd
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the most practical way to go,'' said Jeannette
Anderson, the council's president. ``Anyone who has a small child
and is traveling on an airplane is very likely to have a peanut
butter sandwich stashed away... It creates a false sense of
security for passengers who think there will be no peanuts on an
airplane.''

 NEW YORK: write plays.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Cornelia'' got its start at the Ensemble Studio Theater's
Oktoberfest presentation of new works in 1990 and is being produced
by Fran and Barry Weissler.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is such a thing as hopes being dashed that I'm very wary
of,'' said Olsen, a tall lanky man who wears a ring on his index
finger. ``So to the extent that this is moving forward and will
reach some fruition, I am excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett's story seemed like a fairy tale until its recent
unhappy ending. He was performing his stand-up comedy act in the
Copa Room of the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas two and a half years ago,
and after the show Maxwell, the producer, went backstage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was spectacular, he was fresh and he was funny and he was
politically incorrect in the right way,'' Maxwell said. ``I said,
`Let's turn this into a play.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett kicked around several ideas and finally came up with
the subject he knew best: his own life. So he wrote a comedy about
a middle-aged stand-up comedian living on Long Island who is trying
to make it big. The play, ``More to Love,'' featured Bartlett as
himself, Dana Reeve as his wife and Joyce Van Patten as his agent.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett said the play's themes grew out of his own midlife
crisis: ``I was facing my 40th birthday and really taking stock.''
</P>
<P>
   A friendly, heavy-set man born in Brooklyn, Bartlett describes
himself as a nerdy kid who used to put on Beatles records and
pretend he was one, was chosen last in football and made up for
being unpopular by being funny.
</P>
<P>
   From age 10 on, Bartlett grew up on Long Island, where he and
his wife now live with their three children. He wrote little
one-act plays as a child _ ``Mystery on Skull Island'' was one of
his fifth-grade works _ majored in English and theater at Alfred
University in upstate New York, and got started in stand-up comedy
at the White House Inn on Long Island, the place where Eddie Murphy
began. In an interview this fall, Bartlett said, ``I really feel as
if it's all been working up to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, after his brief Broadway debut, he said: ``Obviously, it's
a sad thing. But I'm proud of the work. I hold my head up high.''
</P>
<P>
   For Shaber, too, this would seem to be the moment he's been
waiting for. His play, ``Second Coming,'' about a disgraced former
attorney general and the ousted president who betrayed him, was
written in 1983. It had a troubled production under a different
title, ``Bunker Reveries,'' at the Roundabout Theater about 12
years ago. One producer, Gene Wolsk, a friend for more than 40
years, recently decided it was worth another try. ``Thank God he
likes this play,'' Shaber said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Second Coming'' is to open sometime this season; Wolsk said
the Manhattan Theater Club was considering it. ``Trying to find a
theater is like 16 different kinds of a nightmare,'' Shaber said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Shaber does not seem discouraged. Over a plate of potatoes
with his breakfast coffee, Shaber said theater was all he had ever
loved. It was long ago that he abandoned plans to go to medical
school, attended Yale Drama School and moved to New York to be a
playwright. By writing films _ ``Rollover'' with Jane Fonda and
``Nighthawks'' with Sylvester Stallone _ he has been able to live
with his wife in New York and raise two daughters, now grown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depends what bug bites you when you're 11 or 12 years
old,'' Shaber said. ``If the theater bug bites you, you can never
get over it. If you feel that way, having a play done in New York _
there's simply nothing like it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Shaber does not even venture to call this his
big break. He has been around too long for that. ``I think if you
wait for breaks you're in trouble,'' he said. ``Maybe once upon a
time, in the 1930s, it was possible to become an overnight
sensation, but does that really happen anymore?''

 &HT;    A majority of the nation's black churches are having financial
problems
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_Over half of the nation's black churches are
experiencing serious financial difficulties, according to a
three-year study released today by Atlanta's Interdenominational
Theological Center.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which examined congregational giving at 141 black
churches nationwide, suggests pastors of black churches must
develop more business savvy.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the messages being communicated is that your preaching
may be good and you may excite the congregation on Sunday, but you
really need to manage your money and be accountable,'' said Walter
Collier, the study's lead researcher.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are particularly disconcerting because of the
urgent need for leadership by the black church in the communities
they serve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today the Black Church is being confronted with a deluge of
black people in need, thanks in part to socio-economic turmoil in
urban communities, retrenchment in government assistance to the
indigent, and a reneging on affirmative action opportunities,'' the
report says.
</P>
<P>
   The study is scheduled to be released this morning at a 10 a.m.
press conference on the ITC campus at the Atlanta University Center
near downtown. ITC is a consortium of six seminaries, representing
six denominations, and is the largest source for academically
trained black clergy in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found:
</P>
<P>
   -- About 77 percent of money taken in by black churches is used
to maintain basic expenses such as maintenance and programs.
</P>
<P>
   -- Black congregations in urban areas tend to give more in
offerings and tithes than their suburban counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   -- Blacks belonging to the Church of God in Christ, Pentecostal
and Baptist denominations give more than other denominations.
</P>
<P>
   Although half of the black churches reported serious financial
difficulties, the study did not idenitfy what those specific
problems were. It assumed that the churches were operating in the
red.
</P>
<P>
   Though Atlanta's black church scene is known for its opulent
mega-churches, such as New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in
Lithonia, the report said such successful churches are rare. Only
10 percent of black churches had annual incomes of $1 million or
more, the study discovered.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Eddie Long, pastor of New Birth, wasn't surprised by
the findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of us are still running our churches in a 30-year-old
mentality,'' he said. ``That's not going to work. There's a lot of
things you have to do to keep up with the times.''
</P>
<P>
   Long, who majored in business administration at Morehouse
College, credits his business background for some of New Birth's
success. The church recently broke ground on a $40 million facility
that will include a 7,700-seat sanctuary, and a stadium that will
hold 30,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Long also said some black churches are hampered by pastors who
are only figureheads, and by ineffective lay leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some churches are run by boards. The pastor is not really the
lead, he's a figurehead,'' Long said. ``That's a paralyzing factor
in the market today.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such advice, the study found that most black church
officials prefer to have groups, not individuals, handling
financial matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It spreads the decision making and it promotes a sense of
trust,'' Collier said, echoing the findings of the study. ``It
provides a system of checks and balances, particularly during these
times when we see televangelists running away with the money.''
</P>
<P>
   The study is recommending pastors become more business-savvy.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just what the Rev. George Moore has been doing in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Pastor of St. Phillip's AME Church in Decatur, Moore, 62, has
been attending business seminars, learning about the Internet, and
seeking help of business professionals to help run the church.
</P>
<P>
   His efforts seemed to have hit paydirt. Last Sunday, St.
Phillip's began holding services in anew $11 million sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   But when his newfound business acumen doesn't work, Moore said
he relies on some old-fashioned methods to get by.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pray 24 hours a day,'' he said.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Must we force physics upon our daughters?
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The knock on professional feminists is that women dislike them
even more than men. A man doesn't have to utter a peep when the
likes of Sally Quinn and even Betty Friedan deny all association.
Friedan broke with the National Organization for Women in the '70s,
criticizing its hardening ideology. Quinn, in The Washington Post
several years ago, wrote a piece no man could ever write. The
headline asked, ``Who Killed Feminism?'' The answer was given in
the subhead: ``Hypocritical Movement Leaders Betrayed Their Own
Cause.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is proud to be called one anymore, but the fact is that
all of us, male and female, are feminists in principle. We believe
in equal pay for equal work, in equal opportunities for men and
women, in equality before the law _ in short, we believe in
fairness.
</P>
<P>
   And we especially believe in fairness for our children. We don't
just believe in it; we will fight for it.
</P>
<P>
   So the radio ad by the Women's College Coalition last week
struck the ear with an odd note of remoteness from the lives of men
and women I know. Get your daughter interested in chemistry and
physics at an early age, it said in so many words. Point her toward
engineering, technology, computers.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot was clear, and it was reinforced by a report the same
week from the American Association of University Women: Our girls
are getting shortchanged again. They're not going into the sciences
and engineering in the same numbers as boys.
</P>
<P>
   This in itself is not news, but the reasons given are. Because
it's hard to argue anymore that girls are restricted, new buzzwords
have entered the picture. Between the fifth and ninth grades, the
Women's College Coalition tells us, girls' talents and abilities go
``underground.'' In their hearts our girls are really chemical
engineers and mathematicians, but ``a chilly environment''
discourages them and so they settle for something else. And that
something else is, by implication, something less.
</P>
<P>
   If this is so, then what have all those women teachers in the
elementary schools and high schools been doing? Encouraging the
boys, but discouraging the girls?
</P>
<P>
   The Women's College Coalition, trusting studies by a pair of
academics named Myra and David Sadker, says that's exactly what
they've been doing. ``Women teachers have the same prejudices male
teachers have,'' says Jadwiga Sebrechts, president of the Women's
College Coalition. They toss the girls the softball questions and
look to the boys for more analytical responses.
</P>
<P>
   One listens to such things with a weary sigh. A glance at the
newspaper tells you the world's not a happy place for many people,
and here is someone worried about a gender gap in engineering. Why
should we be certain girls want to be engineers and scientists in
the first place? And why is it, by the way, that social and
developmental problems are preponderantly a male thing?
</P>
<P>
   It gets down _ of course _ to numbers. Only 8 percent of
graduate degrees in physics are awarded to females. To Jadwiga
Sebrechts this is a gender gap. It's obviously a statistical
difference _ you could even say a gaping one _ but is it
necessarily evidence of injustice? Are young women not going into
physics and chemistry because the environment conditions them to
look elsewhere?
</P>
<P>
   When reality doesn't conform to expectation, something's wrong
with the environment. The Women's College Coalition, which
represents colleges in the United States and Canada, wants to
encourage women to consider other fields besides teaching,
psychology, home ec _ the girls' ghetto. But what percentage in
physics, say, would reflect a fair shake? Would it require
statistical parity _ something close to 50-50?
</P>
<P>
   Sebrechts, who was trained as a physicist, speaks only of ``a
critical mass,'' perhaps 15 percent, that would be enough to raise
the temperature in the physics department and encourage more women.
(There are places colder yet: ``The really bad ones for women are
electrical engineering and soil mechanics.'')
</P>
<P>
   But assume that 15 percent of the graduate degrees in physics
were going to women, and that it was enough to attract other women.
If it was double that _ 30 percent women, 70 percent men _ why
should one assume equity had been achieved? That's the problem when
numbers are the only evidence.
</P>
<P>
   On National Public Radio last week, a correspondent grave with
concern reported the American Association of University Women's
``findings.'' One third of college males major in some
technological field, but only one quarter of females. The worried
correspondent asked Christina Hoff Sommers, professor of philosophy
at Clark University, her thoughts. Sommers calls herself a feminist
but has problems with ``studies'' like this. Doesn't there seem to
be a gender gap? NPR's reporter asked.
</P>
<P>
   Sommers' weary sigh sounds just like mine. ``Absolute myth,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   In her book ``Who Stole Feminism?'' Sommers neatly exposes the
statistical sleights of hand from which all these gaps are deduced.
But you still have the hard fact that not many girls seem to like
engineering, chemistry and physics. To say it has to be the
environment _ but where exactly in the environment? _ sounds, after
a while, like witchcraft. Yes, and if the cat had her litter in the
oven, I suppose they'd come out biscuits.
</P>
<P>
   Every father I know would be proud to see MIT confer a doctorate
on his daughter. Just as proud as he'd be if it were his son. But
what goes on in the hearts and minds of any parent takes in quite a
lot more than just that. The professional feminists have no sense
of this. To them, that's all there is _ the woman is her career,
and this rest is trappings. Wherever her interests and aptitude
take her, I pray my daughter finds more in her life than a career.

 &HT;    Launching Glenn into space _ again
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Scott
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's one of those weeks where the magazine world doesn't seem to
be operating as a well-oiled cartel, all of the newsweeklies
pumping out slick versions of the same cover story.
</P>
<P>
   What must be on America's mind, the editors of Newsweek ($2.95)
have ascertained, is shooting a 77-year-old senator into space _
and it has nothing to do with the Congressional investigation of
President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's cover is devoted to John Glenn's next space shot
(36 years after he rode Friendship 7 into history as the first
American to orbit the Earth), and is a launching point for a report
on the science of aging.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine says Glenn's Oct. 29 journey is reassuring, if for
no other reason than it reminds us that aging Americans can ``do a
lot more than crossword puzzles.''
</P>
<P>
   THE SHEPARD CASE: Time ($2.95) devotes its cover to the Laramie,
Wyo., murder of gay college student Matthew Shepard (``The War Over
Gays''), and how that slaying has galvanized the gay community and
cleaved the political landscape into factions for and against
acceptance of homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gay politics is more complicated than ever right now because
what seems like an irresistible force of cultural change is meeting
an immovable object of political resistance,'' reports the
magazine.
</P>

 &HT;    Christian compilation a pre-release hit
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rapidly growing sales of Christian music _ the '97 total was
$550 million _ will get another boost today with the arrival in
stores of ``WOW 1999,'' an all-star compilation from the Sparrow
Label Group that has shipped gold with advance orders for more than
500,000 units.
</P>
<P>
   With that many copies of the two-CD, 30-track set moved, the
Nashville-based Sparrow Label Group confidently predicts ``WOW
1999'' will surpass the '96 and '97 compilations, both of which
generated sales of more than 1 million. The participating artists
this year include dc Talk, Newsboys, Jars of Clay, Steven Curtis
Chapman, Michael W. Smith and Bob Carlisle, who drew in many
mainstream fans in '97 via his original crossover hit, ``Butterfly
Kisses.'' The two discs offer mildly disparate styles, with one CD
devoted to rock and alternative pop and the other to more
traditional pop and inspirational music.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Founding Father's Sweet Apple grave to get its due
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If anybody had ever told me I would jump up and down with
excitement over a group placing a headstone on an old grave in the
woods, I would have said it couldn't be so. But it was.
</P>
<P>
   I heard from George E. Thurmond that the members of the Piedmont
chapter of the Georgia Society of Sons of the American Revolution
are coming to Sweet Apple settlement at 11 a.m. Nov. 21 to place a
marker on the grave of James Adams, who was one of the builders of
my cabin.
</P>
<P>
   I knew about the grave. It's in the woods up the hill back of
Chadwick's store. The late Aubrey Chadwick walked me up there one
day shortly after I moved to Sweet Apple, and I was very touched to
see the lonesome, overgrown little grave.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard for me to believe that a man who was in on the
birthing of our country could have been still alive and active when
his son cut the logs and put up my cabin early in the 19th century.
Neighbors told me Mr. Adams was a strong and active gentleman and
that those big rocks in the chimney were put there with his help.
</P>
<P>
   So now his service to our country is going to be formally noted
and celebrated. The Sons of the American Revolution have planned a
real program with a color guard, pledge of allegiance, unveiling a
marker, laying a wreath, taps and a benediction. I wouldn't miss it
for anything.
</P>
<P>
   There are not too many American Revolution veterans around, Mr.
Thurmond said. He knows of the graves of a few in Decatur, some in
an old cemetery near Tucker and some at Utoy cemetery south of
Atlanta. The most notable is the grave of John Clark, son of the
famous Elijah Clark, who went back to war with his wounded father
when he was a kid of 14, eventually became a two-star general and
was buried in Florida. His grave was later moved and now is marked
by a handsome monument in the national cemetery in Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Thurmond suspects there were many Georgians fighting in the
revolution, but finding their graves has been difficult, although
he spends a great deal of time searching and checking with
historical groups. He feels that they should be well marked, and I
agree, especially since I feel a great bond with James Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Adams' great-great-grand-daughter Ann Wilt, who lives in
Charlotte, will speak at the ceremony, giving us some details of
his life. He volunteered July 24, 1776, with the 3rd Regiment of
South Carolina. I always wished I could have known him and asked
all those questions about where he fought and with whom.
</P>
<P>
   We will hear about him from Mrs. Wilt and her sister, Alecia
Jameson, who are to be at the grave-marking ceremony. I hope to
hear more of the Adams family, which dwelled in Sweet Apple cabin
so many years ago. They do know that he was married and had 11
children.
</P>
<P>
   The program will be open to the public, but there is a problem
about parking. They are asking people who wish to attend to meet at
the Kroger shopping center at Crabapple and Arnold Mill roads,
where car pooling will be provided. Chadwick's store and the little
grave are only three miles from there.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Thurmond calls it a one-grave cemetery, but Larry Chadwick
suspects there were other graves there, now sunk into the earth and
unmarked. He doesn't know why it was chosen for burials, since
there is no church close by, but he is pleased to report that weeds
and underbrush are being cut so the walk up the hill won't be as
difficult as I remember.

 &HT;    Taking `AIM' at suicide: Prevention plan unveiled
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a time in this country when few people knew what to do
if someone choked on a piece of food. Now almost everyone knows
about the Heimlich maneuver. That didn't happen by accident.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of activists, health professionals and government
officials has proposed a similar _ if more complicated _ campaign
to reduce suicide, which takes the lives of more Americans than
AIDS or murder.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday in Atlanta, U.S. Surgeon General
David Satcher unveiled a national suicide prevention strategy that
emphasizes better training, more research, increased access to
mental health care and, above all, heightened public awareness
through education in the schools, Web sites, toll-free numbers,
resource centers and public service announcements. It's all
designed to put suicide on the national radar and convince people
that they, and not just doctors, can do something about
self-destructive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purely medical approach will not do the job,'' Satcher
said. ``By the time most suicidal people come into contact with
medical care, it's much too late.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy grew out of the National Suicide Prevention
Conference, a first-time summit of experts, activists and
policy-makers held last weekend in Reno, Nev. It was organized by
Jerry and Elsie Weyrauch of Marietta, who lost a daughter to
suicide. The conference resulted in 80 detailed recommendations,
which were boiled down to three areas of emphasis, summarized by
the acronym ``AIM'':
</P>
<P>
   -- Access. Enhance access to mental health services and improve
recognition of depression.
</P>
<P>
   -- Illuminate. Broaden public awareness and reduce the stigma
associated with mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   -- Methodology. Fund more research into the causes of suicide
and evaluate prevention programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not just making a list here. We're going to do things,''
said Mark Rosenberg, director of the CDC's violence prevention
branch, which has taken a leading role in the suicide fight.
``Suicide is preventable, and we can't keep that secret any
longer.''

THE GENDER WARS, STILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It has been more than three decades since the
landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act decreed that job discrimination
against individuals on the basis of gender _ or race, color,
religion and national origin _ is not only morally but legally
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Yet here we are, still stuck with a congressional leadership
determined to apply a double standard when it comes to federal
health benefits available to men and women.
</P>
<P>
   In the era of the two-paycheck household, House Republican
leaders waged a last-ditch battle to block insurance coverage for
contraceptives to protect women in the federal work force against
unwanted pregnancy. Both men and women benefit from birth control,
but the only prescription contraceptives available are taken by
women, who also bear the major care-giving burden of raising
children.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, those same conservatives readily approved $50 million
to subsidize prescriptions for Viagra to energize the sexual
relationships of male military personnel and veterans. The
government encourages men to have sex, but is reluctant to protect
women from the consequences of sex.
</P>
<P>
   Does this contradictory attitude toward the health care needs of
men and women make sense? Is sexual schizophrenia good public
policy? Of course not.
</P>
<P>
   But it does reflect both the power of the religious right over
Republican politics and an ingrained cultural pattern that still
thinks that when it comes to sex it is okay for boys to be boys but
not for girls to be, well, like boys.
</P>
<P>
   One of the last sticking points in the massive budget battle
this week was a provision under which all federal employee
insurance plans must cover contraceptives just as they cover other
medical prescriptions. Currently, only 19 percent of federal health
plans cover all five of the most widely accepted contraceptive
drugs or devices _ birth control pills, diaphragms, IUDs, Norplant
and Depo-Provera _ and 10 percent offer no coverage whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   The battle was primarily symbolic. The law would affect only
federally employed civilian women of childbearing age. But if the
federal government dismisses contraceptives as unimportant to
employee well-being, private industry can feel free to do the same.
Often it already does.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Rep Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., a broad coalition of moderates
and liberals pushed the contraception amendment through both the
House and Senate attached to a major spending bill. But when it got
to the House-Senate conference, House Republican leaders
unilaterally tried to ax the provision in secret and thwart the
majority will. They were puppets for pro-life advocates who
dominate the GOP and view birth control as only slightly less
sinister than abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Lowey and her allies were on the alert, rode to the
rescue and saved the day _ and the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   A 1994 Alan Guttmacher Institute study showed that in general
women pay about 68 percent more in out-of-pocket health expenses
than men, partly because many insurers don't cover basic
reproductive health services. By contrast, many insurance plans
provide coverage for male-only needs, such as drugs for urological
and prostate problems.
</P>
<P>
   It is sad that after so many decades we are still treating
women's health needs differently from men's _ and unequally.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was exposed 22 years ago, when the Supreme Court
ruled that the General Electric Company could exclude pregnancy in
its disability coverage for workers because, Justice William
Rehnquist wrote for the majority, it was ``not gender-based
discrimination at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist went on to note that insurance companies were free to
cover some risks and not others, and that there was no risk from
which men were protected but not women, or vice versa. The fact
that only women got pregnant was irrelevant
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, the high bench, composed then entirely of male
justices, was oblivious to the fact that prostate problems,
male-only ailments, were commonly covered by insurance. Only
Justice William Brennan, in his dissent, noted acidly that ``it
offends common sense to suggest that ... pregnancy is not, at the
minimum, strongly sex-related.''
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision was so unjust that within two years
Congress passed a law specifically prohibiting discrimination
against pregnant women in any area of employment and requiring
employers with health plans to include coverage of the costs of
pregnancy and childbirth. President Jimmy Carter signed it
immediately, and most employers currently accommodate pregnant
workers without undue disruption or difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   Now the issue has passed from equal treatment in the workplace
for pregnancy to equal treatment for prevention of it. And
conservatives are still trying to give women the short end of the
stick and claim gender discrimination has nothing to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   The new argument is that while insurance plans provide coverage
for male-only needs such as Viagra, those are medically necessary
costs. This is news. An erection may be desirable, but medically
necessary?
</P>
<P>
   Birth control, by contrast, is depicted as merely preventive and
therefore not necessary. What? Are not immunization shots, blood
pressure pills and allergy medication preventive measures commonly
covered? Tell the potential sufferers they are not necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Equity for women in prescription insurance is still elusive. But
thanks to Lowey, Congress has made a start, despite Speaker Newt
Gingrich and his cronies.

 &HT;    Report: Press too reliable on Starr as source of information
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A report released Monday by an independent journalism watchdog
suggests that the press has become overly reliant on Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr as the source for reporting the scandal
involving President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington D.C.-based Committee of Concerned Journalists
found that overall coverage of the White House crisis in the last
seven months was sound, and the industry had been avoiding many of
the ethical lapses _ such as using unidentified sources _ that were
evident when the story first broke in January.
</P>
<P>
   But the 38-page report ``The Clinton Lewinsky Story: How
Accurate? How Fair?'' also observed that some journalists at major
TV stations and newspapers had developed ``a penchant to emphasize
the perspective of investigators over those being investigated.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also cited a quote from Starr in which he said his
dealings with the press were akin to working with ``informants.''
Critics of Starr's office have accused him of leaking secret grand
jury testimony in order to shape public opinion. The judge
presiding over the grand jury has also asked Starr to show cause
why he should not be held in contempt for leaking prejudicial
information.
</P>
<P>
   The report focused on six major ``threads'' that had been widely
reported in the case, everything from the infamous blue dress
belonging to Lewinksy to apparently false stories that Clinton also
had affairs with other White House interns.
</P>
<P>
   In most of those stories, the report concluded, ``the press
ferried speculation, some of which could have been construed as
threats from investigators into news accounts, raising questions
about whether the press was sufficiently wary of being used by
sources.''

 &HT;    Fictional Croker looms large over Atlanta's landscape until his
real estate empire goes bust in Wolfe's new book
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though the Atlanta Chamber of Commerce is not likely to put Tom
Wolfe's latest novel on its required reading list, the city comes
off much better than some people feared.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Man in Full'' (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $28.95) will not hit
shelves until Nov. 10, but some reviewers received advance copies
Monday. Without divulging too much of the plot, here's a preview of
what to expect:
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia-born novelist's first major work since ``The
Bonfire of the Vanities'' 11 years ago begins in the heat of
Freaknik and ends with the cool teachings of the Greek Stoic
philosopher Epictetus. In between, Wolfe uses a broad brush and a
wide canvas to capture the multiple racial and economic layers of
metropolitan Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The novel traces the lives of three men: Charlie Croker, an
Atlanta real estate developer and conglomerate magnate; Roger White
II, a black lawyer in a white-glove Atlanta firm; and Conrad
Hensley, the 23-year-old son of hippie parents.
</P>
<P>
   Croker, a former Georgia Tech football hero, has a young second
wife, a 29,000-acre South Georgia plantation, a half-empty office
complex in Cherokee County and a debt of more than a half-billion
dollars. As the novel opens, Croker is on the verge of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Another key player is Fareek ``the Cannon'' Fanon, a black
superstar running back at Georgia Tech whose athletic prowess
propelled him out of the city's slums. Fanon is accused of
date-raping the white daughter of one of the city's wealthiest blue
bloods.
</P>
<P>
   As word of possible criminal charges against Fanon leaks out,
racial tensions begin to bubble, and Roger White II, an upscale
black lawyer, is asked to represent the athlete and keep the lid on
a potentially explosive situation.
</P>
<P>
   Especially concerned about the problem is White's old Morehouse
College classmate Wesley Dobbs Jordan, who is in the midst of a
re-election campaign against black activist Andre Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the characters may sound familiar, but Wolfe has been
careful to make them composites of real Atlantans. Fleet's charge
that the light-skinned mayor is a ``beige half brother'' echoes the
Marvin Arrington-Bill Campbell campaign, but Wolfe casually
mentions Maynard Jackson and Bill Campbell as previous mayors in
the same paragraph as Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true for the real estate developers. Wolfe uses
pieces of several developers _ from John Portman to Tom Cousins _
to create the larger-than-life Croker.
</P>
<P>
   To a large extent, the novel's main character is Atlanta, which
is described perfectly by Jordan as a baseball: ``After you take
the white horsehide cover off, you come across a ball of white
string. ... Finally you get down to the core, which is black, a
small hard black rubber ball. Well, that's Atlanta. The hard core,
if we're talking politics, are the 280,000 black folks in South
Atlanta. ... Wrapped all around them, like all that white string,
are the three million white people in North Atlanta and all those
counties ... Cobb, DeKalb, Gwinnett, Forsyth, Cherokee, Paulding.
...''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe, who was introduced to Atlanta and South Georgia
plantation life by real estate developer Mack Taylor and his wife,
Mary Rose, makes use of his reporter's skills in describing the
city. In one section, Jordan takes White on a driving tour of
Atlanta, up Piedmont Road into Buckhead and onto West Paces Ferry
Road, Tuxedo Road and beyond. As they drive, Jordan explains that
Atlanta is 1,000 feet above sea level and they're driving uphill.
</P>
<P>
   ``But some people in Atlanta are more elevated than others,''
Jordan says, ``and you know what they say always flows downhill.
You and I live in the best parts of South Atlanta, but don't kid
yourself. We still live downhill.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe touches on every area of Atlanta, from Buckhead to
Bankhead, and on social levels from ``Chambodia'' _ the ethnically
diverse community along Buford Highway _ to the cream of Atlanta
society that belongs to the Piedmont Driving Club.
</P>
<P>
   In one chapter, Wolfe presents an acerbic view of Atlanta's arts
community in describing a show of homoerotic paintings at the High
Museum.
</P>
<P>
   As Croker looks in horror at some of the images, he wonders if
he's out of step with the times. ``Or were all these people ...
afraid to let it be known that they weren't sophisticated enough to
be cosmopolites of the new Atlanta, the international city?''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Rose Taylor, who has known Wolfe for years, admitted that
there were risks involved in introducing him to the inner sanctums
of Atlanta society.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of Tom's work is controversial,'' she said. ``And even
though he's a good friend, you don't open the door to the city you
love without considerable pause. His work is grounded in such solid
journalism, though, you have to trust that he will get things
right.''
</P>
<P>
   THE CHARACTERS
</P>
<P>
   -- Charlie Croker, a former Georgia Tech football hero who's now
one of Atlanta's biggest real estate developers. Because of a
failing ego project called Croker Concourse in Cherokee County, he
is more than $500 million in debt and in danger of losing his South
Georgia plantation, Turpmtine.
</P>
<P>
   -- Fareek ``the Cannon'' Fanon, a black football hero at Georgia
Tech who came from the slums. Fanon, a cocky, flashy athlete, is
accused of date-raping the daughter of one of Atlanta's wealthiest
blue bloods.
</P>
<P>
   -- Roger White II, a black lawyer from a silk-stocking firm who
is asked to represent Fanon and help keep a lid on the bubbling
racial unrest.
</P>
<P>
   -- Wesley Dobbs Jordan, Atlanta's black mayor, who is so
concerned about his light skin that he takes up golf to get a dark
tan in time for his re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   -- Andre Fleet, a black activist who refers to Jordan as a
``beige half brother'' and is campaigning on the slogan ``It's time
Atlanta had its `first black mayor,''' discounting Maynard Jackson,
Andy Young, Bill Campbell and Jordan as not being dark enough.
</P>
<P>
   -- Conrad Hensley, a young man who is laid off from his job at
the Croker Global Foods Warehouse near Oakland, Calif., and finds
himself working as Charlie Croker's attendant after the developer's
knee replacement surgery.
</P>
<P>
   -- Raymond Peepgass, senior loan officer at PlannersBanc. In
charge of collecting the past-due loans from Croker, Peepgass has
financial problems of his own and is living in a small apartment
after his wife, miffed about Peepgass' affair with a Finnish
hooker, kicked him out of their Snellville house.
</P>
<P>
   -- Serena Croker, Charlie Croker's young ``trophy wife,'' who is
harder to handle than the rattlesnakes on Turpmtine plantation.
</P>
<P>
   -- Martha Croker, Charlie Croker's first wife, who finds herself
abandoned by Atlanta society after her divorce.

 &HT;    AN EXCERPT
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Atlanta was not one of those older cities, such as New York,
Boston, Seattle, or, for that matter, Paris, London, or Munich, in
which the smart restaurants were to be found in the middle of town
or on the fringes of old residential districts. No, in Atlanta both
Downtown and Midtown, as they were called, shut up tight at 6 p.m.
Monday through Friday and all day Saturday and Sunday, with their
soaring towers standing there like glass ghosts. The only strollers
on the streets at night downtown were hotel guests utterly thwarted
in their desire to go window-shopping at the big city's glossy
restaurants and boutiques _ them and the muggers. The Atlanta
police had their own name for areas where it wasn't advisable to
walk if you looked like you had more than two cents to rub
together: ``dead zones''; and Downtown was one of them.
</P>
<P>
   No, in Atlanta the smart restaurants, like the smart boutiques,
opened in Atlanta's Edge Cities ... commercial clusters that formed
in and around shopping malls and other big mixed-use developments
far removed from Downtown and its tired old problems.

`SLAM' AN UPLIFTING TWIST   O N TOUGH - STREETS STORY   LINE
</HEADLINE>
 OUR RATING: 3 Stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Slam'' takes the urban drama in a strange but
pleasing new direction. Uplifting, if not entirely convincing, it
runs on sheer, committed emotion. That alone is a refreshing change
from the fatalism that permeates most films about the inner city.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``Slam's'' most distinctive element also makes it an
oddity. The title refers to an energetic form of performance
poetry, engaged with social and racial issues and delivered in an
impassioned, melodramatic style. Not surprisingly, the movie's two
leads, Saul Williams and Sonja Sohn, are both competition winners
on the slam poetry circuit. They've got star quality, but they're
not quite ready for movie stardom.
</P>
<P>
   Like sports in a number of ghetto problem films, poetry here is
held up as a route away from the despair and the violence. But this
is no simplistic, ``Fame''-like fable that just substitutes
performance of one kind for another; no one suggests here that
spoken word is going to be anybody's ticket out of poverty.
``Slam's'' point that personal growth comes through reflective
creative expression, however, is persuasively made.
</P>
<P>
   Williams plays Raymond Joshua, an affable small-time drug dealer
in D.C.'s tough Dodge City district. When his connection and
protector is hit bad in an ambush, Joshua is busted on a minor drug
charge by desperate cops. Thrust into the District's horrendous
criminal justice system (bad-example Mayor Marion Barry has an
amusing cameo as a ``teach 'em a lesson'' judge), Joshua is
threatened and pressured to take sides with a gang faction.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his facility for rhyming impresses belligerent inmates
enough to keep Joshua out of danger. It also impresses a comely
volunteer writing instructor, Lauren Bell (Sohn), who's devoted to
teaching the guys self-esteem through self-revelation. When Joshua
gets bailed out, he makes a beeline for the appreciative Bell.
</P>
<P>
   But will the judge and jury he'll have to face be as moved by
Joshua's poetic flights?
</P>
<P>
   Directed by documentary veteran Marc Levin from a script which
many of the actors contributed to _ including the ex-con turned
columnist Bonz Malone, who plays a particularly enlightened
jailhouse ganglord _ much of the movie was filmed inside the actual
D.C. lockup, with real prisoners appearing in many scenes. It's an
understatement to say that the thing has realistic background
texture.
</P>
<P>
   It's the foreground that occasionally gets out of sync. Williams
has a smoldering magneticism in his quieter scenes, a stillness
that radiates both thoughtfulness and hurt. And when he's rhyming
out, there's an electric command and power in his well-matched
words and gestures.
</P>
<P>
   When he plays a highly emotional scene straight, however,
Williams inevitably gets too shrill _ there is no degree or nuance
to his righteous, worried anger. Sohn has similar strengths and
weaknesses as an actress, compounded by the fact that her character
is stuck with the film's preachiest dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those shortcomings, ``Slam'' is a winning fusion of
gritty staging techniques and growth-potential rhetoric. And the
rhymes are sublime _ much more so than that line could ever
indicate.!end! &QL;

WHERE IT BEGAN, HALF A CENTURY AGO ON HENRY STREET  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 25) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For Murray Louis, landmark events are not only the
most obviously important occurences. The Murray Louis and Nikolais
Dance Company will celebrate a 50th anniversary, for instance, in a
weeklong season that opens on Tuesday at the Joyce Theater.
</P>
<P>
   What is being celebrated is not the start of either
choreographer's career or their companies, but rather the beginning
of a yeasty, highly productive residency at the Henry Street
Settlement House on the Lower East Side.
</P>
<P>
   Louis and Alwin Nikolais, who died in 1993, taught at the
settlement house and performed in its theater from 1948 until 1970.
It was there, Louis said in a recent interview, that their
pioneering work in modern dance came to fruition. ``Everything
built to a technique and style and point of view at the
Playhouse,'' he recalled. For him and Nikolais, Henry Street was
``the beginning of everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 50-year span has to be divided by the decades it has passed
through, and each has been distinct politically, socially and in
terms of audience sensibilities and financial support,'' he said.
``Even the venues. So you really have to break it down into all
these little portions. Nothing has remained the same over 50 years.
The only thing you can count on is wrinkles and sore feet.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1990s are epitomized by the television and computer in a new
narrative piece by Louis, with the working title of ``Millennium
Loop,'' that will be performed at the Joyce. ``We all live in the
blue light of the television, of the computer, of all the effects
on all these screens that we sit in front of and stare at,'' he
said. ``When the plug is pulled, no one will know how to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Other eras, other inventions. The season's second program is a
retrospective of work by Nikolais that includes dances created in
the early 1960s. That was a time, Louis recalls, when a dread
settled over the land following the explosion of the Chinese
H-bomb, when universities across the nation began to build
state-of-the-art theaters, and when the federal government began to
contemplate giving money to the arts. It was also the age of
stretch fabric and the tape recorder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine? Prior to that we had cotton and wool tights.
Cotton bagged mercilessly, so when you did a knee bend you came up
with these huge joints at the knees. Wool tights stretched at the
inseams and the crotches. We were constantly mending wool and
shrinking cotton. Now you could choreograph for the whole body, not
just for the arms and upper torso.''
</P>
<P>
   The advent of the tape recorder meant another kind of freedom.
``You had someone in the wings trying to hit the band with a very
nervous hand,'' Louis said of pre-recorder days. Every dance began
with ``yowarggh da-de-de-da,'' he said, imitating the inevitable
scratch of the needle before the music started. Now dances could be
longer or shorter than the dictates of a record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember that the tape recorder (italics)every(end italics)
dancer owned was the Wollensak. They were heavy but they were solid
and small, and every dancer carried a Wollensak around with them.
Today, they carry their vitamins, their bags of grain.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming full circle, Louis talks excitedly of the recent
acquisition by Ohio University in Athens of the complete
Nikolais-Louis archives. The best material, which he will chose,
will be available to scholars on CD-ROMs. ``Five years ago, there
was just a confusion about all this. I'm going to do it, I thought,
when I can grasp it and I know where it's going.''

 &HT;    MICROSOFT FIGHTS BACK IN COURT
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Microsoft lawyer lashed out Tuesday against
Netscape Communications Corp., accusing Microsoft's bitter rival in
the Internet browser wars of pursuing the same tactics that have
made his client an antitrust defendant.
</P>
<P>
   On the second day of the federal antitrust trial against
Microsoft Corp., defense counsel John Warden branded Netscape an
opportunistic ``ward'' of the government that is seeking to regain
lost market share for its browser through the landmark case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Netscape had what the government would consider a monopoly in
the market for Internet browsers until the great Satan, Microsoft,
came along,'' Warden argued.
</P>
<P>
   In a sonorous baritone, the portly Warden, a $600-an-hour
Manhattan-based litigator, confronted Jim Barksdale, Netscape's
president and chief executive officer and the government's opening
witness, for having added e-mail services to its Navigator browser,
Netscape's prime product.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think of that as a perfectly correct thing to do?'' Warden
asked Barksdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' Barksdale replied, with a native Mississippi
lilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``You believed that users would benefit?'' Warden said, pressing
further.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did and do,'' Barksdale snapped.
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale had contended in his testimony that the technology
giant sought ``to eliminate Netscape as a competitor because of the
threat the browser posed to Microsoft's Windows monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   In his lengthy cross-examination, Warden implied that Netscape's
initial dominance in the browser world had put companies selling
stand-alone e-mail programs out of business. His argument was
intended to show that the practices labeled anti-competitive by the
Justice Department were commonly used by software companies.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also trumpeted an undated Netscape document labeled
``The Situation'' that said in part: ``Department of Justice and
court actions create an opportunity for Netscape. ...Client market
share is a corporate goal.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barksdale denied that his Silicon Valley-based company was
hiding behind the government's skirts in order to undermine
Microsoft, the world's largest software firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you thought Microsoft was seeking to destroy your business,
why didn't you file your own lawsuit?'' Warden wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too expensive,'' Barksdale said.
</P>
<P>
   Warden: ``What were your revenues last year?''
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale: ``Several hundred million'' dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Warden also repeatedly pressed Barksdale on whether he had any
further evidence, beyond that contained in his 127-page deposition,
that Microsoft sought to drive Netscape out of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to know whether he is going to get sandbagged with
something later,'' interjected U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson, who is presiding over the case without a jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe,'' Barksdale then responded to Warden.
</P>
<P>
   ``What?'' Warden demanded.
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale said ``four years of talking to my salesmen and
shareholders'' had elicited ample evidence of Microsoft's ``public
relations attack against my company.'' It was an assault, he added,
in which Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates had ``actively
participated.''
</P>
<P>
   Concluded Barksdale, who is due to resume the witness stand on
Wednesday: ``It's a roug-and-tumble world and we got to fight the
best we can. Trash talk is on the floor, but I said let's go just
to these things'' that are in evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft contended in court that its decision to bundle its
Internet Explorer browser with its dominant Windows operating
system was driven solely by customer demand and direct technology
benefits. In any event, any attempt to remove decouple the browser,
as the government has demanded, wouldn't work, Warden claimed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an add-on, like a flash on a camera or a car radio,
but like a shutter on a camera or a car's transmission.'' he said.

</P>
<P>
   ``What?'' Warden demanded.
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale said ``four years of talking to my salesmen and
shareholders'' had elicited ample evidence of Microsoft's ``public
relations attack against my company.'' It was an assault, he added,
in which Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates had ``actively
participated.''
</P>
<P>
   Concluded Barksdale, who is due to resume the witness stand on
Wednesday: ``It's a rough-and-tumble world and we got to fight the
best we can. Trash talk is on the floor, but I said let's go just
to these things'' that are in evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft contended in court that its decision to bundle its
Internet Explorer browser with its dominant Windows operating
system was driven solely by customer demand and direct technology
benefits. In any event, any attempt to remove decouple the browser,
as the government has demanded, wouldn't work, Warden claimed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an add-on, like a flash on a camera or a car radio,
but like a shutter on a camera or a car's transmission.'' he said.

SAN DIEGO CAN'T COMPETE WITH THE BRONX ZOO

   SAN DIEGO _ Tony Gwynn, 38 and feeling like a kid, took the No.
4 subway line from Manhattan to the Bronx last week. Finally, after
eight batting titles and nearly 3,000 hits, he was making his first
trip to Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn dropped off his bags in the San Diego Padres clubhouse and
made a beeline for Monument Park in center field. More than 400
feet from home plate, Gwynn walked among the monuments to Babe
Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Mickey Mantle and Miller Huggins. Behind the
monuments is a wall covered with 16 plaques commemorating assorted
other New York Yankees history makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first player you see is Babe Ruth, and that hit me like a
ton of bricks,'' Gwynn said. ``You think, `This is baseball.'''
</P>
<P>
   Yankee Stadium has been the center of the baseball universe for
so many Octobers. The stadium is 75, and it has been in the middle
of 35 World Series. If they win this series, it would be the 24th
time for the Yankees. The only thing in their way is a San Diego
franchise that has won one World Series game in 30 seasons of
existence.
</P>
<P>

   YAKUTSK, Russia _ To the Russians crazy enough to live there,
summer in the Siberian Arctic is merely a deep breath before the
next winter, a few weeks of melted ice and midnight sun in which to
gird for the next deep freeze.
</P>
<P>
   Either they use those weeks to haul in enough food and fuel to
make it to the next thaw or they shiver and starve through the
coming months of darkness.
</P>
<P>
   The freighter Kapitan Glotov was skimming eastward along that
Arctic coast in late September, loaded with half of the next year's
food supply for much of northeastern Siberia, when the ship's Dutch
owners radioed the skipper an order: stop.
</P>
<P>
   And so it did, just short of the tiny port of Tiksi, where it
had planned to unload its cargo onto barges before the rivers
turned to ice, when barges could still distribute it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shipping company kept sending us instructions that we
could enter the port of Tiksi and unload only with its
permission,'' said the freighter's captain, Aleksandr L. Vyalov.
``The problem was that the freight bill could not be paid.''
</P>
<P>
   The real problem was that the bottom had dropped from Russia's
economy. As the ship steamed toward Tiksi, the rubles that Russia
had pledged to pay the $475,000 freight bill lost two-thirds of
their value. The Dutch demanded more money. The bank holding the
cash was in limbo, unable to pay even a kopeck.
</P>
<P>
   And Siberia, oblivious to the whole dispute, began to freeze
over.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to call Russia's travails political or fiscal, but
here in the Siberian republic of Yakutia, where a bad debt can
condemn thousands to months of hunger, they can be a matter of
survival.
</P>
<P>
   All across Arctic Russia, almost 40 percent of the nation's land
mass, at least eight million people must be fed and kept warm.
</P>
<P>
   That vast enterprise leached untold billions of rubles from the
old Soviet Union. Now it soaks up billions from the Russian
government, which finds it too expensive and logistically daunting
to move from Siberia many of the millions of people the Soviet
authorities lured there to mine the region's fabulous natural
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Among the people who run these vast, frozen lands, there is
growing concern that the supply effort _ like the Russian economy,
the government and the country's adventure with capitalism _ is
cracking under the strain.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Soviet times they brought not just the minimum amount of
supplies, but `insurance' reserves too,'' the governor of Yakutia,
Vasily M. Vlasov, said in an interview. ``In the Arctic they
supplied diesel oil and food for 12 months and even more, half the
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since '91 we've survived six, seven years on the previous
regime. As of today, those reserves are 100 percent exhausted.''
</P>
<P>
   In a situation that seems tailored for panic, no one seems to
doubt that the North will slog through. The only question is how,
and for how long.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten used to getting by without money,'' said Valery
L. Popov, Yakutia's minister of housing and communal services.
``But this cannot go on forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Life in the northern latitudes has never been a sidewalk brunch.
But what ails Russia at large has put the north on the critical
list.
</P>
<P>
   Food and heat cost money, and Russia has none. The Russian
government is too broke to meet the full cost of sending supplies
to the Arctic. Regional governments like Yakutia's are picking up
some slack, even as the ruble's crash has sent the cost of food,
fuel and transportation skyrocketing.
</P>
<P>
   But many regions are also broke. And so some Arctic areas,
especially along Russia's long border with Alaska, face a winter in
which villages may get few or no supplies at all.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's disastrous harvest, the worst in 45 years, led farming
regions to husband their crops instead of exporting them, which led
to hoarding in populous regions like Moscow. Food imports _ up to
half of some meats _ have all but dried up because of the fiscal
crisis. Northern regions at the end of this food chain are left
with a pittance.
</P>
<P>
   Resupply is further hobbled by the near-collapse of Russia's
fleet of nuclear-powered icebreakers, half of which are now
dockbound by mechanical problems or lack of money. Cuts in the
meteorological budget may have led to a seriously late forecast for
winter's onset _ and the stranding of supply barges that now cannot
sail up frozen rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, ``the situation is serious, but it's not
irretrievable,'' said Valery G. Georg, deputy chief of the Russian
government's committee on northern affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Along Russia's east coast, from the Bering Strait to northern
Japan, there is talk of evacuating villages left without food or
fuel. In a telegram on Oct. 2, the elders of the Chukchi Autonomous
District, which borders the strait, warned Moscow that food and
medicine were running out and their remaining fuel would last less
than three weeks. Parts of the Kamchatka Peninsula, opposite the
western tip of the Aleutian Islands of Alaska, received no
deliveries before navigable rivers froze over. Russian public
television last month called the situation there catastrophic.
</P>
<P>
   Norilsk, a big smelting center in north-central Russia, is short
of money for winter supplies because frozen rivers have blocked
exports of metals. Even in European Russia, where good roads insure
the delivery of supplies, Norway and Finland are offering relief
aid to those who can no longer afford food.
</P>
<P>
   In northern Siberia, where cheap river transport is now a
frozen-out option, villagers are pinning hope on hugely expensive
zimniks _ winter roads, built on the frozen rivers _ and resupply
by air.
</P>
<P>
   ``As of today, we have enough flour, salt and cereals. And
that's it,'' said Georgy N. Fyodorov, administrator of the
Ust-Yansk District, an Arctic coast area three times the size of
Switzerland that is home to 14,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   One obvious solution is to relocate people from the most remote
areas, where life and work are simply beyond normal economics. But
costs are enormous, and there are thousands and thousands of people
who need to be moved.
</P>
<P>
   This is a world of cold, darkness and sometimes hardship
completely alien to Westerners: towns and even mid-rise cities
built entirely on stilts sunk deep into the permafrost;
temperatures so low _ 65 below zero for weeks on end _ that autos
have double-pane windshields and houses triple-pane windows; rivers
that in some places are ice-free only two or three weeks a year; a
tundra larger than Western Europe, without a single railroad and
with precious few highways.
</P>
<P>
   And almost no people, until the Soviet Union began luring them
there decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Millions came to Siberia and the north because the Soviet
government paid them _ handsomely, for the times _ to exploit the
area's stores of gold, diamonds, tin, platinum and oil. To sustain
them, the Kremlin set up a ``northern delivery'' program, run from
St. Petersburg, which hauled in supplies on a military-style
schedule, without regard to cost.
</P>
<P>
   In post-Soviet Russia, cost matters. Carrying food thousands of
miles, then dispersing it among tiny villages hundreds of miles
apart, is hugely inefficient. Heating houses and factories at 85
degrees below the freezing point of water is fantastically
expensive: A ton of diesel oil that costs 2,000 rubles in Moscow is
worth five times that by the time it reaches Yakutia, officials
here say.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Worse still, the Soviet authorities did little maintenance.
Democratic Russia inherited a patchwork of dilapidated mines,
schools and towns and a system of social services like medical care
in places where many professionals just will not work.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have hemorrhaged cash to keep it all together. This
year they will spend 530 million rubles _ $85 million, before the
ruble's crash in August _ to feed and heat people in the Koryak
Autonomous Territory. The territory is larger than Britain, with
barely 31,000 residents. A third of the money goes just to move
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could take all the population of Koryak, put them in
five-star hotels in Moscow and give them three meals a day to eat
and it'd be less expensive,'' said Georg, the senior official on
northern affairs. ``But it's the policy of the government, and we
have no choice.''
</P>
<P>
   The immense republic of Yakutia _ imagine six Frances,
freeze-dried and pieced together _ is a poster child for the
problems of resupply.
</P>
<P>
   Stretching from the Arctic Ocean almost to China, Yakutia covers
more frozen territory than any other region of Russia and boasts an
embarrassment of gold and diamond mines. Mostly it is empty space:
mining camps and villages along three north-south rivers; one
railroad, only a couple of hundred miles long; one major highway,
and one million people, a quarter of them in the capital of
Yakutsk.
</P>
<P>
   Another 100,000 live in the Arctic. The coldest spot on earth is
here, in a depression several hundred miles north of the capital,
and virtually the entire region is permafrost.
</P>
<P>
   The region is heated by some 1,700 government-owned steam
boilers _ some of them almost 100 years old. A rickety 1,400 miles
of pipes, insulated with sawdust, ashes, snow or nothing at all,
link them to homes and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to 50 percent of the heat is used to improve the weather,''
Popov joked.
</P>
<P>
   To sustain the north, the Yakutia and Russian governments
planned this year to spend about three billion rubles _ perhaps
$500 million before the ruble crashed in August, but worth
considerably less now.
</P>
<P>
   The money was for eight ocean shipments _ two freighters of food
and six big oil tankers _ and countless barges of coal, oil and
food brought up the broad Lena River from the south.
</P>
<P>
   Russia was to provide 841 million rubles for freight, but so far
has sent only 250 million. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov recently
signed a decree ordering money for northern supplies. But the
Finance Ministry says it has no money _ and anyway it is too late
to deliver most supplies by cheap river transport.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need money in November,'' Popov said. ``We need it
now. Ice is approaching the shore.''
</P>
<P>
   And costs are rising _ about 40 percent for fuel and shipping
since the ruble plunged. Three fuel tankers refused to unload this
fall, Vlasov said, until he warned them that the resulting crisis
would put Yakutia ``on its back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kapitan Glotov also agreed to unload after the government
agreed to negotiate a new price, but only if the goods were kept
under seal on shore, Yakutia officials said. Finally, fearing that
the goods would be sold to black marketeers or held until
distribution was impossible, Vlasov called in the militia and put
the shipment on river barges under armed guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not embarrassed to say that we had to use force,'' he
said, smiling and crooking his finger around an imaginary trigger.
``There was no other way because of the time limit. Those rivers
are getting frozen.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He has cause for concern. Only 47,000 tons of food have been
shipped to northern Yakutia, barely half the 89,000 tons shipped
last year. Low water levels on the Yana River prevented coal
shipments from reaching many settlements, insuring costly midwinter
trips to refuel villages.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the north is rationing heat _ holding daytime
temperatures in homes and businesses to a chilly 54 degrees _
because there is not enough fuel for the oil burners that are the
main source of steam.
</P>
<P>
   In Ust-Yansk, a mining region that sits atop the Arctic Ocean
delta of the Yana River, coal is used to generate steam. But that
district has exhausted its 108 million ruble budget _ less than
half of what was requested from Moscow _ and has no extra money to
buy food.
</P>
<P>
   A 500-day food reserve left from Soviet days is now gone. So is
the old 18-month fuel reserve. All power is turned off from 11 p.m.
to 6 a.m. _ a span soon to be lengthened by two hours _ and, soon,
from 9 a.m. to noon as well.
</P>
<P>
   Fyodorov said he missed ``the good old Soviet days,'' when
supplies were timely and sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago, if I had been asked about this situation, I
would have said it is catastrophic,'' he said. ``Today, compared to
what's going on elsewhere and to the Russian Federation, I'd say
we're more or less normal.''

NEWLY BOUGHT KACD-FM ADOPTS TRIPLE-A FORMAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The album alternative format of beloved but
defunct KSCA-FM is back with a different name and a new home on the
dial.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, dance-oriented Groove 103.1 flipped formats Monday
afternoon to triple-A (adult album alternative), with ex-KSCA music
head Nicole Sandler plotting the playlist.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Monica station, KACD-FM (103.1) _ now known as Channel
103.1 _ will operate without disc jockeys while a nationwide hunt
continues for air talent and a music-intensive morning show,
Sandler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking to lots of people, the best in the biz from
around the country,'' she said, adding that new KACD owner,
Kentucky-based Jacor Communications, promises a long-term
commitment to album alternative in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This format needed to be back on the air in L.A.,'' said David
Benson, KACD's acting program director.
</P>
<P>
   Benson also programs Denver's heritage triple-A outlet KBCO-FM,
which recently placed third in the market in the sought-after
25-to-54 demographic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intent is to have a lot more variety and lot less
repetition for the kind of artist that has become more mainstream
since KSCA went off the air,'' Benson said.
</P>
<P>
   KSCA ceased broadcasting Feb. 4, 1997. Since then, other local
adult-oriented stations like Star 98 have picked up some of the
format's core artists, including Natalie Merchant, Sheryl Crow and
Sarah McLachlan.
</P>
<P>
   Benson said KACD's playlist will be broader, ranging from Bob
Marley to R.E.M. to Lucinda Williams and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're calling it `wall-to-wall world-class rock,''' Benson
said. ``We're in the process of building a music library, so we're
starting out by playing what we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the talent roster is in place, Sandler will helm KACD's
afternoon-drive program from 3 to 8 p.m. The station is also
available over the Internet at www.channel1031.com. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
MORE ON ART BELL
</P>
<P>
   Little has been revealed about the circumstances that drove UFO
aficionado and overnight talk host Art Bell to resign from the
airwaves Oct. 13. But a new announcement from Bell hinted he may
return soon.
</P>
<P>
   Bell's statement at the beginning of a replacement program heard
locally on KABC-AM (790) late Monday again referred to a ``terrible
life-threatening event, which occurred to my family about a year
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Insiders say Bell, 53, left the airwaves to help his young son
through a nonmedical emergency.
</P>
<P>
   The radio host asked listeners to keep him and his family in
their prayers.
</P>
<P>
   Bell's ``Coast to Coast'' syndicated call-in show was broadcast
from a trailer in Pahrump, Nev., about 50 miles from Las Vegas, to
roughly 6.5 million listeners on more than 400 stations.
</P>
<P>
   The program was a kind of ``X-Files'' of the airwaves, focusing
on alien abductions, cattle mutilations and secret government
programs. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SHOW-TUNE TIME
</P>
<P>
   KCSN-FM (88.5) has a new weekly program devoted to show tunes.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Snow with lightning and thunder occurred at elevations above
10,000 feet in the western Colorado Rockies Tuesday as high-level
moisture continued to stream into the West from the tropics.
Wednesday, moisture will make inroads into the interior West at
both high- and low-levels as a weak upper-level low pressure system
over California summons a broad southerly flow of moist winds into
Utah, New Mexico and Arizona. Scattered rains will develop, with
totals of an inch or more possible in the Rockies as moist
low-level winds from the southeast are forced to ascend the sloping
terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Over the southern half of Florida, scattered showers and
thunderstorms will develop as moist winds from the east continue
unabated. A few showers and storms will produce moderate to locally
heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
   The chilliest air mass of the season will spread eastward from
the Great Lakes to the northern and central Appalachians on
Wednesday. Chilly showers will form downwind of Lake Erie and Lake
Ontario as Canadian air is moistened in transit over tepid lake
waters. Snow may mix with rain at high elevations of northwest
Pennsylvania later in the day. Generally light accumulations are
possible at night. Snow is also possible later in the day and at
night from the highest elevations of West Virginia and western
Maryland to the mountains of northern New England.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly chilly air will spill east of the mountains to the
Northeast and northern Middle Atlantic Seaboards on gusty winds
from the west-northwest averaging 15 to 25 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Winter Falters
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, winter lost its grip on the panhandle of Alaska
on Tuesday as newly fallen snow in the mountains near Juneau melted
away under a fierce assault of warm air. But the cost of surging
Pacific warmth was high. Winds gusted to 64 mph at the federal
building in downtown Juneau early Tuesday, while the capital city's
24-hour rainfall ending at 4 a.m. was 3.36 inches, with heavy rain
still falling. Downpours came after recurrent rains over the
weekend, leading to flood warnings. The threat of mudslides mounted
on mountains just recently blanketed in white.

HARVARD SEEKS TO IMPROVE SUPPORT FOR STRESSED STUDENTS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By CAREY GOLDBERG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Spurred on by the recent death of a star
graduate student who killed himself with cyanide, Harvard is
changing some of its policies to improve support through the
stressful pre-doctoral years, university officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Altom, a 27-year-old, fifth-year graduate student in
chemistry, was the third Harvard graduate student to commit suicide
since last year, and the one whose death carried the most pointed
message to the university about the pain for some of
graduate-school life.
</P>
<P>
   In a suicide letter provided by his family to the Harvard
Crimson, Altom said his death could have been avoided and wrote:
``Professors here have too much power over the lives of their grad
students.'' He supported the idea of arranging for a group of
professors to oversee students' thesis work, diluting the power of
a student's direct adviser: ``If I had such a committee now I know
things would be different,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   That was back in August that Altom wrote the note and then
killed himself using cyanide taken from his laboratory. In
September, the Chemistry Department responded by announcing a
nine-point plan that included creating just the kind of committee
Altom had advocated, along with offering more counseling, more
social mixing, lectures about coping with stress, and more advice
on careers both in and out of academia.
</P>
<P>
   Such a multiple-mentor plan had already been under
consideration, Dr. Alan Long, director of graduate studies at
Harvard's Chemistry Department, said Tuesday, but ``thoughts about
implementing such a system were certainly revived'' by Altom's
writings.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, Harvard's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences
surveyed its students during registration this fall about their
relationships with their advisers, and has been conducting a series
of student-faculty talks on the issue. It has also begun a series
of ``Succeeding in Graduate School'' lectures on topics from time
management to the how-to's of communicating with an adviser, and
added instruction to help foreign students adjust to America and
Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that this recent student death has been the trigger
for initiating these discussions,'' said Margot Gill, the
administrative dean of the graduate school. ``But we don't want to
miss the opportunity now to be sure we have asked the question
across all of our departments: `Is there more we ought to be
doing?'''
</P>
<P>
   The recent suicides _ by Altom; Fung Lam, a first-year graduate
student who had just begun in the same lab as Altom last year; and
Hailei Ge, a computer-science student who jumped from a building _
have cast a spotlight on the difficulties for some of high-pressure
graduate school life, especially at such a competitive university.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an isolated incident by any stretch,'' said Kevin
Boyer, executive director of the National Association of
Graduate-Professional Students, which represents the campuses of
about half the country's 2 million graduate and professional
students, about 400,000 of them doctoral candidates. ``There are a
lot of examples of students who react to the stress badly, and I
think while the situation isn't typical, it's something more common
than people will admit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Graduate school,'' he said, `` is a highly stressful situation
in that it's a kind of
apprenticeship-slash-employment-slash-academic experience all
rolled into one, and as a result you have students with significant
financial pressures, significant research pressures, significant
teaching obligations, and you have to layer on all of that the
familial issues, because half the people in graduate school are
married.''
</P>
<P>
   In research-oriented graduate school, a student's adviser can
often take on particularly central importance as the provider of
the student's grant money, instruction, guidance on thesis-writing
and even selection of the thesis-approval committee.
</P>
<P>
   Boyer said that his association advocates the kind of
multiple-mentor system that the Harvard Chemistry Department has
just approved, and in particular, he said, it is important for
students to have a faculty mentor other than their adviser _ to
whom they can complain if they have adviser problems, and who can
encourage them to have a life outside the lab or library.
</P>
<P>
   Eight graduate students have committed suicide at Harvard since
1980, officials said _ not an unusual rate for a university. Of
those, three have been in the laboratory of Altom's mentor,
Nobel-Prize-winning chemist Elias J. Corey. But Long asserted
Tuesday that by all indications, the first two deaths, one last
year and one in 1987, had nothing to do with the students' work in
Chemistry. One student, he noted, had been very successful in his
work, and the other had barely begun.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their efforts, Harvard officials said Tuesday, they
expect no quick fix for the tricky adviser-advisee relationship, in
large part because it depends so heavily on the particular human
foibles of each teacher and student.
</P>
<P>
   Experts agreed that such relationships tend naturally to be
fraught with complexity, intensity and tension. ''Students are
interested in impressing their professors,'' said Anne Pruitt,
scholar in residence at the Council of Graduate Schools in
Washington, D.C. ``They want to become scholars; they want to do a
good job; they know their professors are the persons who are going
to take the lead in their placement whenever they graduate, and so
it's for many a high-pressure kind of experience. The student's
future is on the line''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ How often does a performer appear who has the vocal
power and charisma to make you believe in a better musical future?
Once in a generation? When Audra McDonald, the 28-year-old
phenomenon who made her Broadway debut four years ago in a revival
of ``Carousel,'' unfurls her operatic alto with its bright,
quickening vibrato, then breaks into a triumphal cry before dipping
into an ominous funk-tinged blues shout, a better musical future
seems not only possible but upon us, right here, right now.
</P>
<P>
   The world evoked by her voice is a place rich with fantastic art
and extravagant feeling, a realm where genres become weak in the
knees and helplessly collapse into one another. Whether singing
opera (``Master Class,'' ``Porgy and Bess''), Broadway pop
(``Carousel'' and ``Ragtime''), folk or rhythm-and-blues, Ms.
McDonald is so fearlessly true to her own musical and dramatic
instincts that you quickly stop wondering if what she's singing is
opera or pop or gospel. You surrender to the spell of a voice that
pounces on the inner life of a song and sets it on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McDonald's singing is rooted in paradox. She's a formalist
(trained at Juilliard) with perfect pitch and impeccable diction,
yet when she overrides generic boundaries, you sense a bursting
spontaneity. When an operatic phrase suddenly breaks into a gospel
cry, this is not a trained singer slumming; the choice feels like a
necessity summoned from deep within. But behind that spontaneity
exists a rigid, self-imposed discipline that respects the written
musical phrase. The tension between Ms. McDonald's enthusiasm and
her training makes for singing that is high-strung but never
hysterical, intensely dramatic but not ostentatiously
self-dramatizing, free-flowing but never flighty.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McDonald, who gave the first of three Monday evening
performances at Joe's Pub, the sleek, red-lighted new cabaret at
the Joseph Papp Public Theater, recently released a significant
debut album, ``Way Back to Paradise'' (Nonesuch), that is all about
imagining a better musical future. And on Monday, she performed
most of the album's 14 songs, which showcase a younger generation
of theatrical composers.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Ian Gordon, Michael John LaChiusa, Jason Robert Brown,
Adam Guettel and Jenny Giering are all gifted songwriters whose
work falls somewhere in the nebulous region separating Broadway,
serious folk-pop, and the concert art songs of Ned Rorem, Samuel
Barber and other conservative romantics.
</P>
<P>
   The father figures of this eclectic, genre-bending movement _
and a movement it is _ are George Gershwin and Leonard Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   But in tilting as much toward the concert and operatic stage as
toward Broadway, the Young Turk composers so far seem to lack the
populist touch of their forerunners. Think of Barber's ``Knoxville:
Summer of 1915,'' for soprano voice and orchestra, but flavored
with bass, light drums and guitar, as a precursor of ``Way Back to
Paradise.''
</P>
<P>
   Since it's unlikely that Barbra Streisand, Celine Dion and their
ilk would put any of these songs on a collection, the worrisome
question arises: Will any of the new composers be welcomed by a
Broadway audience conditioned to view Andrew Lloyd Webber as the
high end of musical theater composition?
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Ms. McDonald, accompanied by a trio led by Ted
Sperling, was joined at different moments by all the composers who
contributed to her album.
</P>
<P>
   Very much in the mode of Barber's ``Knoxville'' were two numbers
from Gordon's song cycle ``Only Heaven,'' based on poems by
Langston Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Guettel joined Ms. McDonald on ``Come to Jesus,'' an aching
art-pop gospel song about a woman about to have an abortion, from
his song cycle ``Saturn Returns.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McDonald bit deeply into LaChiusa's ``Way Back to
Paradise,'' a caustically funny song distilling centuries of sexual
politics. The evening's most wistful note came with Ms. Giering's
lovelorn reflection, ``I Follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Its finest story song, Brown's ``Stars and the Moon,'' recounted
the life of a woman who forgoes romantic excitement to marry
wealth. But for unalloyed vocal passion, nothing matched Ms.
McDonald's version of ``Some Days,'' Stephen Marzullo's pop-gospel
setting of a James Baldwin poem, a song not on her album.
</P>
<P>
   And passion was what this show was about. If Ms. McDonald and
her collaborators accomplish nothing else, they have arrived just
in time to rescue a dying form, the concert art song, by infusing
it with the open-heartedness of rock, gospel, folk and blues. It is
an act of salvation.

HAVING FUN IS IG NOBEL ENDEAVOR

<P>
   UNDATED - Let's see, Amartya K. Sen won the Nobel Prize for
economics the other day, and Walter Kohn and John Pople won for
chemistry . . . wait, if it's Nobel season, that can only mean one
thing _ it's also time for the Ig Nobels!
</P>
<P>
   If you think of the Nobel Prizes as ``Masterpiece Theatre,''
think of the Ig Nobels as ``The Larry Sanders Show.'' The work is
still top-notch; it's just that it's also funny as hell, poking a
hole in Nobel pretentiousness. Unless you are the sort who can't
find humor in this year's Ig Nobel prize for biology, given to
Peter Fong of Gettysburg, Penn., for ``contributing to the
happiness of clams by giving them Prozac.'' Gives new meaning to
the phrase happy as a . . . well, you know.
</P>
<P>
   Last week I made my annual check-in with Mark Abrahams
(``Congratulations on not winning again this year,'' he began).
</P>
<P>
   Abrahams is the editor of ``Annals of Improbable Research''
(www.improbable.com), which is that most delightful of oxymorons:
the science humor magazine. ``AIR'' sponsors the Ig Nobel ceremony
at Harvard, at which the prizes are presented in a ceremony that
always includes genuine Nobel laureates giving them away (four were
on hand this year).
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people think these prizes are given to things that are
bad,'' Abrahams said. ``That's not the case. They're given for
achievements that cannot or should not be reproduced. And that
covers just about anything.''
</P>
<P>
   No kidding. For instance, the Ig Nobel in medicine this year
went to Patient Y and his doctors at Royal Gwent Hospital, in
Newport, Wales, for ``the cautionary medical report `A Man Who
Pricked His Finger and Smelled Putrid for 5 Years.' '' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Sniffing out a winner &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They had never seen a case like this before,'' Abrahams said,
adding that the authors published the report in part to see if any
other doctors had treated similar maladies and knew how to help the
poor wretch. Happily it appears that things are going to turn out
OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said the man smells better now,'' Abrahams said.
``Apparently he's doing tolerably well.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the doctors could attend the ceremony, but one of their
cousins is an undergrad at Harvard so he picked up the prize for
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He smelled fine,'' Abrahams said.
</P>
<P>
   Other winners included Jerald Bain of Mount Sinai Hospital in
Toronto and Kerry Siminoski of the University of Alberta in the
statistics category for their carefully measured report ``The
Relationship Among Height, Penile Length and Foot Size.''
</P>
<P>
   The four Nobel laureates all wore gigantic shoes when presenting
the prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``You looked over and could see these four men (begin ital)
beaming,'' (end ital) Abrahams said, ``with the biggest grins on
their face you can possibly imagine.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Persistence pays off &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then there is perhaps Abrahams' favorite Ig Nobel this year, in
safety engineering, which went to Troy Hurtubise, of North Bay,
Ontario, for developing and personally testing a suit of armor that
is impervious to . . . grizzly bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been working at this stuff for years,'' Abrahams said of
Hurtubise, who has tinkered with the suit for a decade. ``It's a
guy with an idea who's really stuck with it. How often do you see
that?''
</P>
<P>
   The awards ceremony included, among other things, numerous
tributes to duct tape, including a duct-tape fashion show and,
naturally, a duct-tape opera. Then there was the annual
Win-a-Date-With-a-Nobel-Laureate contest. . . .
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds like a bunch of extremely intelligent people
goofing off in a somewhat scientific way, that's because it is.
Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   ``Underneath there is a half-serious intent,'' Abrahams said,
``which is that we are all hoping this can get more people
interested in science _ that science isn't a yucky thing.''

   I think he's on to something. Until I heard about the Ig Nobels,
the only time I ever considered science fun was when I saw a guy
named John toss a half-dissected frog out the window in 10th-grade
biology. But now I see science's lighter side, the fun that it can
offer.

truck.

   In Tennessee, in New Jersey, in Maine, in Texas, people who
never met Shepard mourn him and pray for a day when gays will not
be attacked for being ``different.''
</P>
<P>
   It's 1998, and we're still debating whether an attack on a gay _
based at least in part on the victim's sexuality _ constitutes a
hate crime.
</P>
<P>
   It's 1998, and ``religious'' people are still showing up at
funerals to spit on the graves of deceased gays.
</P>
<P>
   It's 1998, and politicians are still moralizing about the gay

<P>
   It's 1998, and we're still not comfortable with two people of
the same gender living together as a legally married couple.
</P>
<P>
   It's 1998: Do we know where our compassion is?
</P>
<P>
   I've never understood the fear and hatred some straights feel
for gays. (Right about now is when I start hearing from anonymous
cowards who leave me phone messages like, ``I always knew you were
a fag, Roeper!'' For the record, again, I'm a raving heterosexual.
Who cares.) They get more worked up talking about the immorality,
the depravity, the sick and twisted nature, of gays, then they ever
do about murderers, rapists or child molesters. Somehow they're
threatened by the mere existence of homosexuals and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   Let me try this out on the gay-bashers. Imagine living in a
world where 90 percent of the population is homosexual _ but you're
as straight as you are now. You like the opposite sex, you've
always liked the opposite sex, and the idea of feeling romantic
toward someone of your own gender just grosses you out.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are those in the gay majority who feel they have the
right to dictate your life. They say what you're doing is wrong.
They say you can't marry outside your gender. And a tiny but
terrorizing percentage of them would like to kick the crap out of
you just for being straight.
</P>
<P>
   It'd be a lousy way to go through life, wouldn't it? Hearing
political leaders saying you're diseased; reading news stories
about straights who are killed for no reason other than sexual
orientation; wondering if someday you'll be victimized by some
thugs who will shout, ``DAMN HETERO!'' while beating you to a
bloody pulp.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you wouldn't change your ways because of all this hatred
and ignorance and prejudice, would you? You're straight! It's who
you are, for God's sake; it's not a lifestyle choice. All you
really want is equal treatment, and to be left alone.
</P>
<P>
   Now we return to the real world, dominated by straights. A world
where the gays want only to be treated as equals, and to be left
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Explain to me again why you feel you have the right to deny
those wishes.

AILING KING HUSSEIN JOINS CLINTON TO PROD MIDEAST PEACE TALKS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Jordan's King Hussein threw his considerable
prestige into the Middle East peace talks Tuesday as he joined
President Clinton to push for an accord between Israel and the
Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   The king, ailing with cancer and recovering from chemotherapy,
arrived at the Wye Plantation on Maryland's Eastern Shore amid
signs both sides were willing to continue negotiations to complete
a pact this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``King Hussein is a person of great integrity who has enormous
support amongst many different peoples in the Middle East. He's
someone who we hope will be able to instill in the two delegations
a greater understanding of the need to make the tough choices that
are necessary to reach an agreement,'' said James Rubin, the State
Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, we're into a phase of very hard bargaining, a lot of
the underbrush has been cleared away,'' Rubin said. ``It's part of
the end-game that is getting more and more serious. As we indicated
earlier, some obstacles have been overcome, but significant gaps
remain.''
</P>
<P>
   The peace talks in the rural Wye River setting entered their
sixth day with Clinton, having canceled a two-day campaign trip to
California, again spending the afternoon and evening at the Aspen
Institute compound.
</P>
<P>
   The president has spent five of the six days at the rural
complex, shuttling between the delegations. The negotiations have
been likened to the Camp David talks two decades ago that resulted
in a historic peace agreement between Israel and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   The mood between the delegations of Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat
brightened considerably Tuesday following a series of harsh
exchanges Monday stemming from a grenade attack in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press, quoting anonymous sources, reported that
the Israelis and Palestinians have reached a tentative
understanding on several key points. The preliminary agreement
calls for Israel to withdraw from an additional 13 percent of the
West Bank over a 12-week period while the Palestinians move to
confiscate weapons from militant groups and to jail terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The United States would act to verify weapons seizures and
jailings, according to AP. But a major sticking point was whether
Israel would withdraw from even more territory.
</P>
<P>
   CNN reported disagreements over whether there would be a third
redeployment of Israeli troops in the West Bank, whether the
Palestinian Authority would extradite suspected terrorists to
Israel and whether the Palestinians would remove language in their
charter calling for Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Israel had been pressing for a partial agreement. But AP quoted
Palestinian official Yasser Abed Rabbo as saying, ``we will reject
any formula for a partial agreement. We are insisting on a
comprehensive agreement, and that's what President Arafat has told
all the parties.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis and Palestinians remain in the interim stage of a
1993 peace accord that called for these issues to be resolved by
May 1999 so the discussions could turn to even more difficult
issues. Arafat has threatened to declare a Palestinian state if
there is no agreement by May 1999.
</P>
<P>
   This phase of the peace talks have been locked in stalemate for
19 months after a series of terrorist attacks against Israelis.
Netanyahu repeatedly has demanded Palestinians craft a detailed
security plan for combating terrorists before agreed to cede more
control of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the right-wing factions of Netanyahu's coalition
government have threatened to topple him if he makes any agreement
during the Wye River talks to give back land.
</P>
<P>
   The West Bank and East Jerusalem were once part of Jordan. King
Hussein, who lost the territory to Israel during a war, has called
for using the West Bank land for a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   The king, undergoing cancer treatment at the Mayo Clinic in
Minnesota, flew to his Washington area home on Monday. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright urged him to join the Wye River session.
King Hussein brokered a pact between the two sides last year over
Hebron. &QL;

FLOODING SWAMPS CITY ON BANKS OF GUADALUPE RIVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSANA HAYWARD  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VICTORIA, Texas _ The surging Guadalupe River rose higher than
anticipated here Tuesday as it continued on its destructive path,
displacing not only hundreds of people but dozens of wild animals
from a zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Alligators, ocelots and bald eagles were reluctantly freed from
cages to escape drowning in the rushing water.
</P>
<P>
   And rescuers interrupted early morning Mass at a downtown chapel
in Victoria, forcing the priests, nuns and about a dozen
parishioners to leave before floodwaters got any deeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still hadn't had communion,'' said Sister Silvia Gomez.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we had two or three hours before any water came,
but nobody thought it would happen,'' she said as she and another
nun were led to safety.
</P>
<P>
   Some 2 feet of rain in the San Antonio area swamped the
Guadalupe, sending floodwaters cascading downstream into cities
like Victoria. Hundreds of homes in the city were reported damaged.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Zoo, spread out on six pristine acres in Riverside
Park here, was under several feet of water, trapping about 250
native Texas animals as the river rose to more than 31 feet,
blanketing everything but the tops of trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the animals we had to let go. We cut wires and let
them out,'' said Sherry Hornstein, executive director of the zoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We let birds, deer out ... red wolves, four alligators. Goats
and pigs were on the roof. We're not worried about the pelicans,
ducks and geese because they can swim'' Hornstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Zookeepers were in shock and in tears as they put the few
animals they could save in pet carriers to take to veterinarian
clinics. They said they didn't want to ask authorities for a boat
because they were being used to rescue people from homes or
rooftops.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come first,'' one worker said.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day in this South Texas city of 65,000, rescuers
in helicopters, boats and city dump trucks plucked drenched
residents from flooded homes.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Mader, the city safety officer, said there was a danger of
power being cut off throughout Victoria because water was nearing a
dike at the Central Power and Light substation.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhoods of Greens Edition, Old Victoria and Cheapside
that hug the river as it bends around the city _ and much of
downtown _ were under water. Mader said 600 people had left their
homes, and boats and helicopters had rescued at least 60 people
Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The police, firefighters and Red Cross workers had gone door to
door Monday, warning people to get out, but not everyone heeded the
warning. After all, the river had never come up so high before.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't cooperative yesterday. That's why we're having to
rescue them now,'' fire Capt. said Rafael de la Garza said Tuesday.
``These people coming out now, we talked to yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   At an abandoned railroad bridge at the working-class
neighborhood of Under the Hill, the river roared below like a giant
waterfall. With tears streaming down their faces, several residents
watched as the water violently smothered their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents are old-fashioned. They didn't believe they would
get flooded,'' said Robert Averyhart, who went to Victoria from
Houston to get his parents out of the house. ``They got out today
just to satisfy me and my brother. Otherwise they would have
stayed.''
</P>
<P>
   And there was Henry Martinez, 80, who wouldn't leave without his
three dogs, King, Rusty and Chula. Shaking with fear, two Doberman
pinschers and a dachshund were brought out of a flooded, home,
pulled against their will on leashes against the current.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't coming out unless I got my dogs. I love my dogs,''
said Martinez, adding: ``They protect my house ... This is the
first time they've been in water.''

SALINAS HAD $90 MILLION IN DRUG MONEY IN BANK, SWISS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By TIM GOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Officials in Switzerland announced Tuesday that they have seized
more than $90 million from Raul Salinas de Gortari, a brother of
Mexico's former president, after a police investigation found that
Salinas filled Swiss bank accounts with money he received for
protecting drug shipments into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the evidence showed that he was a very important and
very powerful man,'' a senior Swiss police official, Valentin
Roschacher, said of Salinas at a news conference in Bern. ``With
all of his contacts and power, he could guarantee those loads.''
</P>
<P>
   The confiscation of Salinas' fortune _ and a formal Swiss
request that the authorities in Britain seize $23.4 million more
that he deposited there _ marked the end of what Swiss officials
said was the most ambitious investigation they have ever undertaken
into corruption abroad.
</P>
<P>
   With help from law-enforcement officials in the United States,
Swiss investigators located almost 80 witnesses, who said they had
seen Salinas meet with traffickers, introduce them to other
prominent Mexican politicians and pick up suitcases full of cash.
</P>
<P>
   But the credibility of some of those witnesses has already been
in dispute, and the Swiss attorney general's order to seize the
money is only the start of a legal fight that could drag on for
months. Lawyers for Salinas, the elder brother of former President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari, said they will go before Switzerland's
supreme court to demand the return of the funds.
</P>
<P>
   In an open letter from the maximum-security prison outside
Mexico City where he awaits the outcome of a murder prosecution
against him, Raul Salinas attacked the Swiss allegations Tuesday,
calling them ``stories of narcofiction that cannot survive the most
basic scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Swiss officials did not file criminal charges of money
laundering against Salinas, asserting that the law would only allow
them to if he had been arrested in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   They also declined to charge his wife, Paulina Castanon, and her
brother, who were arrested in 1995 after Ms. Castanon tried to
retrieve a phony Mexican passport that Salinas had hidden in his
safe-deposit box at a Geneva bank. Because she did not marry
Salinas until 1993, the officials said, she was not with him during
the period between 1987 and 1993 when he took in most of what they
estimated was at least $500 million in drug-traffickers' bribes.
</P>
<P>
   As he has before, Salinas asserted Tuesday that the money in
Switzerland was part of an investment fund he pulled together from
some of Mexico's wealthiest businessmen. But after more than two
years in which he and his lawyers have been resolutely vague on the
question, Salinas' lead attorney in the case, Eduardo Luengo Creel,
told a news conference in Mexico City that three contributors have
now made formal statements to the Swiss about their participation
in the plan.
</P>
<P>
   The largest of those supposed investors, Carlos Peralta
Quintero, filed suit against Salinas on Friday in Mexico City,
demanding the return of $49.7 million that he said he had invested
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Peralta, who controls a huge Mexican cellular-telephone and
industrial conglomerate, gave no indication that he had broken with
Raul Salinas, who has been a friend since childhood. Rather, the
suit appeared to be a procedural step to force the Swiss
authorities to consider Peralta's account of the financial
transaction.
</P>
<P>
   The two other participants who stepped forward, Roberto Gonzalez
Barrera and Carlos Hank Rohn, share two obvious qualities with
Peralta. Both come from families that have long been tied to the
Salinases, and both are prominent businessmen whose enterprises
received lavish support during the presidency of Carlos Salinas.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Swiss attorney general, Carla del Ponte, nor federal
police investigators who appeared with her in Bern offered a direct
answer to questions about the role that Carlos Salinas might have
played in his brother's affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In the 369-page police report that is the basis for seizing the
money, investigators wrote that they could not determine ``how
far'' Carlos Salinas and other relatives might have been involved
in Raul Salinas' illicit affairs.
</P>
<P>
   But the report adds: ``In our opinion, it has been proven beyond
a doubt that the circle of family and friends around former
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari got paid royally by various
Mexican and Colombian drug cartels for protection from arrest and
security of drugs. They are therefore co-responsible for the
current major drug problems in the United States of America.''
</P>
<P>
   A copy of part of the document was obtained by The New York
Times. Swiss officials said Tuesday that they would not make it
public.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This week, Mexican newspapers reported that Carlos Salinas had
flown to Cuba from his exile in Dublin, Ireland, in order to meet
with members of his family and plan a response to the legal actions
his brother faces. In addition to the Swiss case, Raul Salinas is
under investigation for money laundering in the United States and
France.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, prosecutors last week asked that he receive the
maximum sentence of 50 years in prison if he is convicted of
ordering the 1994 murder of a prominent governing-party politician
who was once his brother-in-law. They also announced that they
hoped to use the witnesses gathered by the Swiss, and $119 million
in bank deposits separate from those cited by the Swiss, to pursue
a drug-trafficking conspiracy case against him. Some corruption
charges are already pending in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview and in documents released Tuesday, Raul Salinas'
lawyer, Luengo, took specific aim at nine witnesses cited in the
Swiss report, asserting that parts of their stories could be shown
to be contradictory or false. Most of those he named are among 16
informants _ some enrolled in the U.S. witness protection program _
whom the Swiss have agreed to identify only by pseudonyms.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Salinas said they would focus on the use of such
witnesses when they deliver their appeal. Mrs. Del Ponte, the
country's chief prosecutor, suggested she was unperturbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very confident that they will uphold the case,'' she
said.

WOMAN WHO WAS DENIED ABORTION IN LOUISIANA UNDERGOES PROCEDURE IN
HOUSTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RUTH SoRELLE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A Louisiana woman with a potentially deadly heart
condition underwent an abortion in Houston Tuesday, after she was
denied the procedure in her home state.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Lee, 26, was in good condition at St. Luke's Episcopal
Hospital after the operation.
</P>
<P>
   She had been on a list for a heart transplant at Louisiana State
University Medical Center in Shreveport when she accidentally
became pregnant about 10 weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of two sons _ Kevin, 5, and Nick 3 _ sought an early
abortion because her heart specialists said the pregnancy would
endanger her life and the medications she takes could harm the
fetus.
</P>
<P>
   Because of her precarious medical condition, she needed to have
the operation in a hospital where her heart could be monitored. She
asked that it be done at the LSU Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, whose heart condition qualifies her for disability benefits
including Medicaid, must depend on public funds for her health
care. She and her husband divorced earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   But medical center officials refused to perform the abortion,
citing state law that allows pregnancy terminations to be done in
public institutions only when the mother's life is endangered, or
in the case of rape or incest.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of five doctors that considered Lee's case determined
her risk of dying was less than 50 percent, said Elaine King, a
medical center spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a medical judgment call as to whether it (an abortion)
is necessary to save the life of the mother,'' King said. ``The
decision was that it (Lee's condition) did not meet the test.''
</P>
<P>
   LSU uses a 50 percent chance of survival as its benchmark in
making such a determination, King said.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana public institutions such as LSU Medical Center at
Shreveport and LSU Medical Center at New Orleans perform few
abortions. The Shreveport center has performed 10 in the past five
years, King said.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, Dr. Bernard Rosenfeld, an obstetrician-gynecologist,
reviewed Lee's records and said he considered her condition
life-threatening. Rosenfeld performed the abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Lee suffers from abnormal heart rhythms and cardiomyopathy, a
gradual weakening of the heart muscles that began when she was
pregnant with her second child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pregnancy would increase the workload on her heart by
one-third,'' Rosenfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   He said there are no studies to pinpoint the risk she faced, but
he considered her heart problem to be one of the rare conditions
that is a medical indication that an abortion should be performed.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Nenney, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood of Houston
and Southeast Texas Inc., disagreed with the Louisiana medical
center's decisions not to provide the abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems as though the poor have returned to the dark ages in
the mid-1970s, when Congress declined to fund abortions for
low-income women,'' Nenney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a wake-up call,'' Nenney said. ``Poor women across the
country, for the most part are in the same boat _ with or without
life-threatening health conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The uproar caused by the medical center's decision drew the
attention of national abortion rights organizations, which
mobilized to pay for the procedure and to find a safe, legal
abortion for the ailing woman. They estimate that the cost can run
as high as $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   But the major issue was finding a place for Lee to get the
abortion, said Maureen Breitell, government relations director for
the Washington-based National Abortion Federation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this kind of thing all the time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Poor women particularly are restricted because federal law
allows states to set limits on the use of Medicaid funds to pay for
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   In 28 states, including Texas, the state-federal insurer for the
poor will pay for abortions only when the life of the mother is
threatened or when the woman becomes pregnant as a result of rape
or incest.
</P>
<P>
   Three states allow abortion only when the mother's life is
endangered; five allow public money to be used for abortions when
in instances of rape, incest, life endangerment and certain other
health conditions. Fifteen allow public funds to be used for
abortion in most or all circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   However, Medicaid limitations did not play a role in Lee's case,
said Breitell. Instead, she had to take the six-hour ambulance trip
from Shreveport to Houston, where her abortion was performed,
because of LSU's interpretation of state law, she said. &QL;

PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY ALLEGES SUSPECT IN GRENADE ATTACK IS `DOUBLE
AGENT' WORKING FOR HAMAS, ISRAELIS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEBRON, West Bank _ The Palestinian who threw a grenade in a
crowded bus station was a ``double agent'' working for both the
Hamas organization and Israel's secret service, the Palestinian
Authority alleged and an Israeli television station reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army earlier had identified the grenade thrower as
Salem Rajab Sarsour, 29. The attack, which injured 66 people, took
place Monday in the southern Israeli desert town of Beersheba.
</P>
<P>
   The army said Sarsour had admitted under interrogation to
killing an elderly rabbi in August and to throwing two grenades
that injured 14 soldiers and eight Palestinians in September. Both
attacks took place in Hebron. He was arrested after witnesses
wrestled him to the ground following the grenade attack.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians officials Tuesday charged that Sarsour agreed to
work for Israel's Shin Bet internal security service after several
meetings with an Israeli agent in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian Authority said that after the Shin Bet
blackmailed Sarsour, he turned to violence to clear his name with
Hamas. They based the allegation on the confession of an unnamed
friend of Sarsour's whom they arrested shortly after Monday's
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The assailant, Salam Sarsour, was a double agent and has
provided the Israelis with information during a series of meetings
for which he received money for the information,'' the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palestinian Authority holds the Israeli occupation
responsible for this suspicious attack,'' the statement said. It
characterized Monday's attack as a ``failed and suspicious attempt
to stab our Palestinian negotiating team.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's attack, which left 24 soldiers and 42 civilians
injured, temporarily overshadowed peace negotiations taking place
at the Wye Plantation in Maryland and prompted Israel to demand
that negotiators focus only on security-related issues. But by
Tuesday, a comprehensive deal on many outstanding issues looked
promising.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's Channel One reported that the Shin Beit had met with
Sarsour two weeks ago and tried to hire him as an agent without
knowing he was responsible for carrying out the killing of Rabbi
Ranaan or the grenade attack on Yom Kippur, Judaism's holiest day.
</P>
<P>
   Channel One characterized the tryst as a ``friendly meeting''
and said that Sarsour had agreed to work for the Shin Bet, quoting
their their defense correspondence, who is privileged to
intelligence briefings.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army would not comment on the report.
</P>
<P>
   Abdel Khaleq Natshe, a Hamas spokesman in Hebron, said only that
his organization reserved the right to resist Israeli occupation of
the West Bank and Gaza. He would not comment on whether Hamas was
responsible for Monday's attack or on whether Sarsour had worked as
an agent for Israel's secret service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hamas follows the way of resistance,'' Natshe said. ``It is
legal for us to fight the occupation, according to international
laws which say that an occupied people have the right to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army statement said that Sarsour, from an area of Hebron
that is under Palestinian control, had a history of Hamas activism
and had been jailed in 1989 and again in 1996 for activities in the
militant organization.
</P>
<P>
   An army spokeswoman said Sarsour told his interrogators that
Hamas' military wing, Izzedin al-Qassam had invited him to join its
ranks after he boasted to a high ranking Hamas official that he had
killed the rabbi, Shlomo Ranaan, in the Hebron settlement of Tel
Rumeida. The army refused to identify the Hamas official.
</P>
<P>
   Sarsour was then trained to handle fragmentation grenades and
given four of them to use in attacks in Israel, the spokeswoman
said.
</P>
<P>
   He threw the first one on Sept. 30, which is Yom Kippur,
Judaism's holiest day. On October 15, he went to Jerusalem to throw
another grenade, but left without carrying out the attack because
he failed to find a suitable target.
</P>
<P>
   Sarsour's alleged attacks heightened tensions in Hebron, a
divided city where 110,000 Palestinians and 450 Jews live in uneasy
proximity.
</P>
<P>
   Following the attacks, settlers complained that peace agreements
had brought only insecurity while 20,000 Palestinians living in
areas of the city still under Israeli control chafed under curfew
for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before there was this agreement, we didn't have terrorists
around our neighborhood with guns,'' said Baruch Marzel, a settler
leader from one of five settler enclaves lodged in the heart of
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday night, four times, these terrorists called the
Palestinian police shot toward Beit Hadassah and toward soldiers,''
he said. ``If this is peace, I would like war.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarsour, a successful plasterer with five children and a
comfortable home, was known in the community as a religious man. He
supported Hamas, but didn't fit the profile of a bomber, observers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Most bombers are young, single, unemployed and hail from the
grinding poverty of Palestinian refugee camps.

 &HT;    MIDDLE EAST SUMMIT APPROACHES 'END GAME'; PROPOSALS FLOATED,
AGREEMENT STILL ELUSIVE
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Israeli and Palestinian leaders were nearing
agreement on a complicated land-for-peace accord late Tuesday, as
President Clinton and Jordan's King Hussein worked into the night
to try to nurse six days of intensive summitry toward a fruitful
finish.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat were reportedly within reach of a deal that would
call for Israeli troops to withdraw in phases from an additional 13
percent of the occupied West Bank and turn over authority for the
relinquished territory to Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement would eventually leave the Palestinians with
effective control over some 40 percent of the long-contested land.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the Palestinians would agree to implement a set of
U.S.-brokered security guarantees aimed at combatting anti-Israeli
terrorism -- like the grenade attack that left 64 Israelis injured
in the southern city of Beersheba on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu has insisted that Palestinians agree to take a number
of steps targeting terrorism, including the confiscation of illegal
firearms, close cooperation between Palestinian and Israeli
security officials and the arrest and, in some cases, extradition,
of suspected terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin suggested that an
Israeli troop withdrawal would, under the U.S. plan, be carried out
in steps, contingent upon actual performance of Palestinian
security commitments.
</P>
<P>
   ''The initiative was designed to create a parallel process,''
Rubin said. ''As greater and greater security is provided and
implemented, greater and greater amounts of land will
</P>
<P>
   be turned over.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said the talks had entered the ''end game,'' but he
declined to speculate on whether an agreement appeared imminent. A
White House official, speaking on background, left open the
possibility that negotiations could extend into an eighth day on
Wednesday, adding that Clinton has blocked out time to continue
with the summit as needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're into a phase of very hard bargaining,'' Rubin told
reporters gathered at the secluded Wye River Plantation Conference
Center, on Maryland's Eastern Shore, where the Israeli-Palestinian
summit has been underway since last Thursday. ''Some obstacles have
been overcome, but significant gaps remain.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin was decidedly more upbeat, however, than on Monday, when
the terrorist attack in Israel threatened to scuttle the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''That did throw a wrench in the works,'' Rubin said, adding
that talks were moving ahead on multiple fronts on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are rushing around and trying to come up with bridging
ideas and ways to resolve existing problems,'' Rubin said, ''rather
than rebutting talking points.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said there was no hard deadline being imposed on the
talks, but he said the time for putting off difficult decisions had
passed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This cannot go on indefinitely,'' Rubin said, ''but we're
taking it one day at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who scratched a two-day campaign fund-raising trip to
California to remain engaged in the Wye talks, journeyed to the
isolated setting Tuesday afternoon for the fifth time in six days.
</P>
<P>
   There he was joined by Hussein, one of the most enduring figures
in the Mideast. The ailing monarch was called in by U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright to help Clinton try to salvage the
talks in the wake of Monday's attack.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein, who is suffering from cancer and has been undergoing
treatment at the prestigious Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., has
been a central figure throughout a generation of hostilities and
peace overtures between Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   He has worked closely with the Clinton administration on the
issue since the Oslo accords set in motion the current peace
process in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ''King Hussein is a person with great integrity, who has
enormous support amongst many different peoples in the Middle
East,'' Rubin said. ''I do expect him to be a key player in this
drama.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, in an unusually blunt moment, the ailing Hussein
expressed open frustration with Netanyahu's government, blaming him
in a letter for bringing the Oslo process to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   The process was essentially stalled for a 19-month period that
ended in late September, when Clinton brought Arafat and the
Israeli leader together for a brief Oval Office meeting that
resulted in the Wye summit.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 2 million of the world's 6 million Palestinians reside
in Jordan, which is sandwiched between Iraq and Israel. Jordan
would be greatly affected by the direction that any peace accord
might take between Israelis and Palestinians.

 &HT;    MIDDLE EAST SUMMIT APPROACHES 'END GAME'; PROPOSALS FLOATED,
AGREEMENT STILL ELUSIVE
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Israeli and Palestinian leaders were nearing
agreement on a complicated land-for-peace accord late Tuesday, as
President Clinton and Jordan's King Hussein worked into the night
to try to nurse six days of intensive summitry toward a fruitful
finish.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat were reportedly within reach of a deal that would
call for Israeli troops to withdraw in phases from an additional 13
percent of the occupied West Bank and turn over authority for the
relinquished territory to Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement would eventually leave the Palestinians with
effective control over some 40 percent of the long-contested land.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the Palestinians would agree to implement a set of
U.S.-brokered security guarantees aimed at combatting anti-Israeli
terrorism -- like the grenade attack that left 64 Israelis injured
in the southern city of Beersheba on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu has insisted that Palestinians agree to take a number
of steps targeting terrorism, including the confiscation of illegal
firearms, close cooperation between Palestinian and Israeli
security officials and the arrest and, in some cases, extradition,
of suspected terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin suggested that an
Israeli troop withdrawal would, under the U.S. plan, be carried out
in steps, contingent upon actual performance of Palestinian
security commitments.
</P>
<P>
   ''The initiative was designed to create a parallel process,''
Rubin said. ''As greater and greater security is provided and
implemented, greater and greater amounts of land will
</P>
<P>
   be turned over.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said the talks had entered the ''end game,'' but he
declined to speculate on whether an agreement appeared imminent. A
White House official, speaking on background, left open the
possibility that negotiations could extend into an eighth day on
Wednesday, adding that Clinton has blocked out time to continue
with the summit as needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're into a phase of very hard bargaining,'' Rubin told
reporters gathered at the secluded Wye River Plantation Conference
Center, on Maryland's Eastern Shore, where the Israeli-Palestinian
summit has been underway since last Thursday. ''Some obstacles have
been overcome, but significant gaps remain.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin was decidedly more upbeat, however, than on Monday, when
the terrorist attack in Israel threatened to scuttle the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''That did throw a wrench in the works,'' Rubin said, adding
that talks were moving ahead on multiple fronts on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are rushing around and trying to come up with bridging
ideas and ways to resolve existing problems,'' Rubin said, ''rather
than rebutting talking points.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said there was no hard deadline being imposed on the
talks, but he said the time for putting off difficult decisions had
passed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This cannot go on indefinitely,'' Rubin said, ''but we're
taking it one day at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who scratched a two-day campaign fund-raising trip to
California to remain engaged in the Wye talks, journeyed to the
isolated setting Tuesday afternoon for the fifth time in six days.
</P>
<P>
   There he was joined by Hussein, one of the most enduring figures
in the Mideast. The ailing monarch was called in by U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright to help Clinton try to salvage the
talks in the wake of Monday's attack.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein, who is suffering from cancer and has been undergoing
treatment at the prestigious Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., has
been a central figure throughout a generation of hostilities and
peace overtures between Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   He has worked closely with the Clinton administration on the
issue since the Oslo accords set in motion the current peace
process in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ''King Hussein is a person with great integrity, who has
enormous support amongst many different peoples in the Middle
East,'' Rubin said. ''I do expect him to be a key player in this
drama.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, in an unusually blunt moment, the ailing Hussein
expressed open frustration with Netanyahu's government, blaming him
in a letter for bringing the Oslo process to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   The process was essentially stalled for a 19-month period that
ended in late September, when Clinton brought Arafat and the
Israeli leader together for a brief Oval Office meeting that
resulted in the Wye summit.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 2 million of the world's 6 million Palestinians reside
in Jordan, which is sandwiched between Iraq and Israel. Jordan
would be greatly affected by the direction that any peace accord
might take between Israelis and Palestinians.

SCHROEDER REACHES AGREEMENT ON SHAPE OF NEW GOVERNMENT  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder reached
a final agreement Tuesday on the shape of a new left-of-center
government that has pledged itself to redistribute taxes, shut down
nuclear power plants and restrengthen Germany's generous social
welfare programs.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks after Schroeder's decisive election victory over
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, his Social Democratic Party reached a broad
coalition agreement with the environmentalist Green Party.
</P>
<P>
   But while the coalition talks have been remarkably smooth for
the most part, Germany's six leading economic institutes asserted
Tuesday that Schroeder's economic program will do almost nothing to
solve the nation's severe unemployment problems.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, industry leaders denounced Schroeder's tax-reform
plan as a recipe for stagnation and reiterated their vow to boycott
the new government's ``alliance for jobs'' _ round-table
negotiations embracing industry, labor unions and the government
over measures to create more jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition agreement Tuesday was a major milestone in German
politics, laying down the blueprint and structure for the first new
government this country has seen since Kohl took power 16 years
ago. Never before has Germany had a government in which key posts
will be held by the Green Party, which arose out of the
environmental and pacifist movements of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the new government is younger, more female and in
many ways more diverse than Kohl's administration. Joschka Fischer,
the Greens' popular and pragmatic leader, will be the new foreign
minister and the new ``vice chancellor.'' Although the Green Party
came of age as a passionate opponent of stationing NATO missiles in
Germany, Fischer has promised to continue Germany's existing
foreign policy and its support for NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder and Fischer betrayed no concern about the rising tide
of economic criticism. At a news conference Tuesday in Bonn, both
men pronounced themselves satisfied with the outcome of their
negotiations and confident about the future.
</P>
<P>
   But the real importance of the coalition agreement is what it
says about the new government's plans and priorities. Because the
coalition marks a formal agreement between the parties on their
legislative goals, the two sides had to reconcile key differences
and commit themselves to a common platform.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Schroeder's Social Democrats set the tone on
almost every issue. In a major change for Germany, the new
government has committed itself to relaxing citizenship
requirements for millions of second- and third-generation
immigrants from countries like Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The two parties also committed themselves to shutting down all
nuclear power plants, which produce a substantial amount of
Germany's electricity. In a setback for the Greens, however, the
new government refused to set a timetable, and many Social
Democrats say the process will take more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   By far the biggest controversy has been over economic policy,
where left-wing traditionalists within the Social Democratic Party
set the dominant tone. Schroeder's choice for economics minister, a
computer entrepreneur named Jost Stollmann, abruptly walked away
from the job on Monday after proclaiming that the new government
was not ready to do what was necessary to spur economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   The highlights of that plan call for a broad tax reform that is
supposed to simplify the country's byzantine system and that would
reduce the overall burden by about 10 million marks, or about 1
percent, a year. In a nod to the Greens, the new government will
also raise gasoline taxes by about 12 percent in the hope of both
discouraging fuel consumption and providing money to lower
individual income tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   The other main pillar of the program is a so-called ``alliance
for jobs,'' a series of round-table negotiations in which political
leaders and unions would try to assemble a package of measures to
increase employment.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders were already infuriated, and reiterated their
charge that the tax reform would shift as much as $60 billion a
year in taxes onto business while providing almost no real relief
through lower rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is another step toward stagnation and higher
unemployment,'' said Hans-Olaf Henkel, head of the German
Federation of Industry.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday Schroeder came under fire from a more neutral
source: the six leading economic research institutes that provide
regular advice to the German government.
</P>
<P>
   In a report, the six institutes said the Social Democrats should
have tried to cut taxes far more dramatically and do more to
simplify the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the kind of comprehensive tax reform that we have
seen in other countries, and that is a shame,'' said Willi
Leibfritz, an economist at the Munich-based IFO institute. The
institutes also criticized the new government's support for much
higher wage demands from German unions and warned that Schroeder's
``alliance for work'' would have little real impact on joblessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to the view of the institutes, it should not be
expected that the employment situation can be quickly and
thoroughly improved by an `alliance for jobs,''' the report said.

SPANISH GOVERNMENT SAYS COURTS WILL DECIDE ON PINOCHET  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MARLISE SIMONS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Eager to appear neutral on a highly charged issue, the
conservative government of Spain said Tuesday that it would let the
nation's courts decide whether Madrid had the right to ask London
to extradite Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator,
for trial there.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers close to the case said in private the Madrid
government was working hard to have the judiciary rule against
extradition.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Abel Matutes, the first senior official to
speak clearly on the topic since Scotland Yard arrested Pinochet on
Friday, said the government would take no action to block the
extradition process that a Spanish judge has initiated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is waiting for the judicial authorities to
decide definitively if the extradition should proceed'' before it
sends the request to Britain, Matutes told Spanish radio.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, nonetheless, a prosecutor who was representing
Attorney General Jesus Cardenal filed an appeal before the tribunal
dealing with Pinochet. The appeal argued that Spain had no
jurisdiction to try the general for crimes committed outside Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The investigating magistrate Baltasar Garzon, 42, said in
telephone interview Tuesday that he had faced permanent opposition
from government prosecutors since he began in 1996 to investigate
torture and killings by the Argentine and Chilean military rulers
in the '70s and '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, and then in May and September, the attorney general
instructed government prosecutors to oppose his investigations,
Garzon said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he worried about the outcome, the magistrate said:
``I feel at ease. I trust our country's institutions. We are on
solid legal ground. Spain has signed and ratified the relevant
Geneva Conventions, and their language has been incorporated into
our national legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   These Geneva Conventions require signatory countries to
prosecute grave violations of human rights and crimes against
humanity that are committed anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Manuel Garca Castellon, another judge in Madrid who was
conducting a parallel investigation into the disappearance of more
than 4,000 people in the Chilean dictatorship, handed over his
cases to Garzon. Court officials said that was to avoid a
duplication of effort and would simplify working with the British.
</P>
<P>
   Garzon, who had to act in haste when he heard that Pinochet, who
had surgery, was to leave Britain earlier than planned, initially
asked the British police for permission to interrogate the
82-year-old general in connection with the death of only one
political prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday he broadened his arrest order to include the killing
or disappearance of 94 people of several nationalities.
</P>
<P>
   For Aznar the Spanish trap set for Pinochet last Friday was all
the more embarrassing, because news of the arrest arrived in the
middle of an Ibero-American conference in Oporto, Portugal. Both
the prime minister and the civilian president of Chile, Eduardo
Frei, were on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Frei and other Chilean officials have put strong pressure on
Madrid to undo the case against Pinochet, contending that he had
diplomatic immunity as a Senator for Life, a post he created for
himself before leaving office.
</P>
<P>
   Aznar, when first asked about the extradition, said: ``The
government may or may not receive requests, and it may or may not
study them, depending on whether it receives them or not and
depending on what they are founded on. But, of course, I will say
nothing until I know what the facts are based on.''
</P>
<P>
   A key to whether Garzon can proceed will be a meeting early next
week, when nine of the 12 magistrates of the tribunal are expected
to convene and rule on whether Spain can claim jurisdiction to
weigh Pinochet's human rights record. That step, the government
said, will determine whether the judge in the case has the right to
request extradition.
</P>
<P>
   But the request would still have to pass political hurdles like
an approval by the justice ministry and, possibly, Aznar's Cabinet.
Political experts in Madrid said Matutes' statement would make it
more difficult for the government to ignore rulings that favored
extradition. The experts said the government's strategy therefore
focused on arguments before the National Court.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Europe, socialist politicians have applauded the
move against the former right-wing dictator. France's Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin told reporters on Monday: ``It seems to me a
good thing that this dictator can be brought to justice, even late
in his life.'' The news of the arrest, he said was ``welcome and
just''.
</P>
<P>
   France, however, chose to pass on the opportunity to have the
Chilean arrested on French soil. Before turning to a London clinic,
Pinochet had apparently planned to have his surgery done in France,
but the French foreign ministry refused his visa request. According
to French diplomats, France had private indications that judge
Garzon was planning to file an extradition request and Paris
preferred to avoid being caught up in the case.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, which played a pivotal role in Pinochet's coup in
1973, State Department officials said the United States was not
involved in the controversy. ``It's a legal matter among the
governments of the U.K., Spain and Chile,'' a State Department
official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``The United States
is not involved.''

<P>
   In its early days, publicists for American Ballet Theater
frequently called it ``a museum of the dance.'' That remains a good
phrase to describe the company, provided one realizes that great
museums can encourage new art as well as preserve old.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since its debut in 1940, Ballet Theater has done both. It
has staged the classics, often in elaborate productions. It has
commissioned major world premieres like Jerome Robbins' ``Fancy
Free,'' Agnes de Mille's ``Fall River Legend,'' George Balanchine's
``Theme and Variations'' and Antony Tudor's ``Pillar of Fire.''
</P>
<P>
   It has also had a shrewd eye for acquisitions; its repertory
over the years has included de Mille's ``Rodeo,'' Tudor's ``Dark
Elegies'' and Eugene Loring's ``Billy the Kid,'' all of them
originally produced under other auspices but now closely associated
with Ballet Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin McKenzie, the troupe's current artistic director, is
continuing these policies. As evidence, take Ballet Theater's
two-week season, which opens on Tuesday at City Center.
</P>
<P>
   At various times in the past, the company would dance in more
than one New York theater during the course of a year. More
recently, it confined appearances here to one long summer
engagement at the Metropolitan Opera House. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year, however, McKenzie also offered an autumn season at
City Center, and he is doing so again. Like an astute museum
director, he has definite curatorial tastes.
</P>
<P>
   The Met, he explained in a recent interview at Ballet Theater
headquarters, is for big spectacles, the dance equivalents of
murals and monumental sculptures. But smaller works can look better
at City Center. He recalled that last year at City Center
balletgoers were often heard to exclaim in delight, ``You can see
the dancers' eyes!''
</P>
<P>
   McKenzie also wants to stress creativity and have City Center
performances feature world premieres, as well as New York premieres
of existing ballets, that he thinks deserve to be shown here. Thus
the current season will give New Yorkers their first look at John
Neumeier's ``Spring and Fall,'' a work to Dvorak from the repertory
of Neumeier's Hamburg Ballet, and new creations by Twyla Tharp,
Nacho Duato and John Selya, one of Ballet Theater's own dancers.
</P>
<P>
   On the basis of what he had observed in rehearsals, McKenzie
called Ms. Tharp's creation ``complex and multitiered'' and Selya's
offering ``jazzy.'' The title ``Spring and Fall,'' he noted, is ``a
bit of wordplay referring both to the seasons and to two types of
actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm delighted that these particular choreographers happened to
be available,'' he said, ``for they represent what I want to show
at City Center.'' Ms. Tharp and Neumeier are internationally
established figures.
</P>
<P>
   Duato is what McKenzie called a ``cutting-edge choreographer''
who is steadily achieving prominence. And, as Robbins was in the
1940s, Selya is a choreographic newcomer from the company's ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Of all these choreographers, Duato perhaps arouses the most
curiosity. His ballets are well regarded abroad; he successfully
brought his Madrid-based Compania Nacional de Danza to New York in
1994 and created the all-male ``Remanso'' for Ballet Theater last
year. Yet this 41-year-old Spanish choreographer is still
comparatively unknown here.
</P>
<P>
   His new work, ``Without Words,'' which receives its premiere on
Thursday, is a lyrical tribute to the power of nonverbal
communication. ``People don't need to talk,'' Duato said as he
paused between rehearsals at Ballet Theater. Nevertheless, he
proved highly articulate as he spoke in fluent English about his
24-minute work.
</P>
<P>
   The accompaniment is Schubert songs. Yet not a word will be
sung. Instead, the songs will be heard in arrangements for cello
and piano by Mischa Maisky.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining his decision to do without verbal poetry, Duato said:
``I could feel the poetry in the music itself. So I let my
imagination flow and develop its own images apart from the text.
And I hope the ballet will also stimulate the audience's
imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   The way a woman places a hand in front of her mouth becomes a
central gesture in the action, one that is also seen in photographs
of the dancers by Nancy Ellison that will be projected on a curtain
during the ballet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The photographs represent other types of images without
words,'' Duato said, ``and the dancers will interact with them. The
curtain has slits through which people can enter or exit. The
photos sometimes duplicate the dancers' poses. At other times
they'll take on a life of their own apart from my choreography.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Duato created ``Without Words'' in three weeks, the
music had been in his head for more than a year. ``I want it to be
a Romantic piece,'' he said, ``yet also very earthy and without the
usual Romantic cliches.''
</P>
<P>
   It requires eight dancers, all of whom are given solo roles, and
Duato has rehearsed two casts in it. In one, an important pas de
deux near the conclusion will be performed by Julie Kent and
Vladimir Malakhov; on other occasions, it will be danced by Susan
Jaffe and Ethan Stiefel.
</P>
<P>
   Duato is busy these days. In addition to creating two new
ballets a year for his company in Madrid, which is steadily
expanding its performing schedule both at home and abroad, he is
being sought after by many other groups. He takes all such requests
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he noted, ``When I'm invited somewhere else, I first have
to see the dancers. Then I have to get an idea of the company's
repetiteurs, the people who will maintain the work in rehearsals.
Some companies have good dancers, yet their rehearsal directors
don't know how to keep ballets alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Duato is pleased with Ballet Theater's staff. And he called it a
company of ``real dancers.'' ``Real dancers,'' he explained, ``are
ones who want to work and explore. They are the most humble,
disciplined and versatile of all performers, and they are hungry to
do new things.''

 &HT;    Commentary: For governor, two at a chalkboard
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ ``Every governor's race since 1920 has been about
education,'' said Garry Mauro, jacket slung over his chair,
sidewalk-worn shoes resting for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   One may go back those 78 years and find taxes, highways or water
high on the issues list. But since public schools are the state's
chief responsibility, Mauro's statement is safe. This race for
governor will not break the string.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there's more to Mauro's differences with the governor than
that. He asserts that Bush goes too soft on polluters, that he
erred in allowing plans to proceed for a nuclear dump in West
Texas. He points out that the numbers defy Bush's 1994 promise to
end felons' early release _ with 60,000 getting out early since
then. (That's fewer than under his predecessor, Bush's people will
say.)
</P>
<P>
   But education is the subject of most of this campaign discourse.
At a time when candidates can fudge their differences almost to
indistinction, the differences here are downright stark.
</P>
<P>
   The key distinction is on what to do for schools with the
state's projected $8 billion budget surplus. Mauro would raise
teachers' salaries across the board by $6,000 to bring Texas to the
national average for teacher pay.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wants the lion's share of the surplus _ $2 billion _ to go
to school property tax relief, which, presumably, would give school
districts wiggle room to raise money through ad valorem levies. In
addition, Bush supports directing $1 billion back to school
districts to use for teacher pay hikes and to meet other needs such
as smaller class sizes.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro would take Bush's ante on class sizes and raise it
considerably, borrowing $2 billion from the Available School Fund
to loan to schools to build more classrooms to lower class sizes.
</P>
<P>
   After making that money available, he said, he'd hold school
districts' feet to the fire to meet the state-required 1-to-22
teacher-student ratio for kindergarten through Grade 4. Too many
are evading it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Mauro's teacher pay plan say that an across-the-board
raise would skirt accountability issues like rewarding teachers
based on merit or targeting extra pay where teacher shortages are
great, such as math, science and bilingual classes.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro counters that the state awarded teachers an
across-the-board raise in 1985's landmark H.B. 72, which
dramatically changed the landscape of public education.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wants to put the pay-raise ball in school boards' hands.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also warns that increasing pay across the board will
unsettle a delicate equity formula in which property wealthy
districts get less from the state than do property-poor ones.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro calls that a ``specious'' dodge by those who don't want
all teachers to get a raise.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush is bullish on charter schools and authorized an
expansion on the handful of charters first authorized in 1995,
Mauro urges that Texas put on the brakes, at least until it sees
whether those charter schools created make any difference in
achievement. Early results _ some will call them premature _ have
not been glowing for charter schools as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   As for school vouchers, while Bush supports a pilot project for
vouchers, the concept is conspicuously downplayed in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro said he supports choice within school districts, but
vehemently opposes vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro urges that Texas ``seize the initiative'' provided by the
current good economic times to make some dramatic investments in
public schools. ``This time will not last.''
</P>
<P>
   Submitted: two ``pro-education'' candidates with a lot of chalk
on their hands. On Nov. 3: a show of hands by the voters.

KING HUSSEIN OF JORDAN JOINS EFFORT TO CONCLUDE MIDEAST ACCORD
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WYE MILLS, Md. _ With Jordan's King Hussein coming from a
hospital bed to join President Clinton at the Middle East peace
talks on Tuesday, optimism rose that at least a partial settlement
will be reached between Israelis and Palestinians after more than
19 months of stalemate and six days of talking here.
</P>
<P>
   But the Americans and the Palestinians are still pushing for a
full settlement of this interim accord, so that final status talks
can start now, just seven months before the Oslo process is due to
end on May 4.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials said that the parties were working on a ``grand
bargain'' that would involve tradeoffs on the key disputed issues
and produce a comprehensive settlement. But no one would predict
success in this effort.
</P>
<P>
   American officials cautioned that agreement of any sort was by
no means assured and that the talks, originally scheduled to end on
Sunday night with a signing ceremony on Monday, would go late into
the night again on Tuesday and then into Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the officials were also laying plans for a signing ceremony
at the White House on Thursday and another ceremony, at the State
Department, to mark the resumption of intensive talks on a final
peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   However, one official cautioned: ``The easiest thing in the
world is to create a ceremony. I wouldn't take a tentative date too
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's spokesman, Joseph Lockhart, said the president would
fly to Los Angeles on Saturday, picking up a fundraising trip for
Democratic candidates he postponed to continue these negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton left the talks just after midnight on Tuesday morning
after making ``significant progress,'' officials said, on key
aspects of the security package that Israel demands from the
Palestinians in return for another 13 percent of West Bank land.
</P>
<P>
   He returned here just after noon on Tuesday for another long
round of meetings, continuing his extraordinary personal investment
of 45 hours over five of the last six days. Hussein, who is
battling non-Hodgkins lymphoma, is expected to remain overnight at
the Wye Conference Center near here.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department spokesman, James Rubin, said on Tuesday
that ``there are still gaps _ significant ones'' between the
parties. He said that Israeli-Palestinian negotiations were
continuing on issues besides security, like safe passage for
Palestinians between the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly we're in a phase of very hard bargaining,'' Rubin
said. ``A lot of the underbrush has been cleared away. The end game
is becoming increasingly serious.''
</P>
<P>
   One sticking point is the Israeli demand for putting on trial a
specific list of Palestinians, including some members of the
Palestinian police and self-defense forces.
</P>
<P>
   Another is the method by which Israel will guarantee safe
passage for Palestinians between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
The Israelis are offering regularly scheduled trains and busses,
while the Palestinians are insisting that individuals be allowed to
travel in cars.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians also want clear assurances that a third Israeli
redeployment, required under the Oslo agreement, will take place
and be of a certain percentage. The issue will be handled by the
border commission of the final-status talks, but the Palestinians
want American guarantees of the outcome, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   A senior American official said that the work between the two
sides had turned serious in the last 12 to 15 hours, especially
after Clinton and his team had a two-hour meeting with Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat before dinner Monday night, and then afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've seen this before, and I've seen this phase not lead
to an agreement,'' the official said. ``It's better than before,
but by no means enough to close.''
</P>
<P>
   Another American official said that the Palestinian grenade
attack on an Israeli bus stop in Beersheba, Israel, early Monday,
wounding more than 60 people, ``acted as a sort of shock therapy to
get them moving.'' But the official noted a degree of luck: ``If 10
or 12 Israelis had been killed in the attack,'' he said, ``the
Israelis would have had to pack up and leave these talks.''
</P>
<P>
   The talks here have followed a familiar pattern, another
official said. ``In the beginning, both sides came in with their
demands and won't move and repeat them and repeat them and repeat
them until everyone's sick of it, and then they begin to discuss
bridging ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Hussein, who flew to his Maryland home on Monday after being
discharged from the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, was asked by the
Americans to come here on Tuesday. ``We think the king will help
bring home to the two delegations the necessity of making the tough
choices that lead to peace,'' Rubin said. ``We think he could play
a helpful and constructive role.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Rubin said, the king ``will be available during
the course of the day where we think he can make the most
difference in encouraging the leaders and their delegations to
focus on moving ahead, rather than focusing on longstanding
complaints and concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Hussein has proven indispensable to peacemaking in the past,
making a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 and helping the Americans
to get the Israelis and Palestinians to agree to the Hebron accords
of January 1997.

PLASTICS AS POP ART 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 25) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PAULA DEITZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KATONAH, N.Y. _ Remember the so-called throwaway plastic culture
of the 60s? Well, no one threw it away, and 30 years later,
pristine artifacts from that period are already turning up in
exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   The 160 objects on view in ``Pop Goes the Plastic: The Visual
and Cultural Esthetic of a New Technology 1960-1975'' at the
Katonah Museum of Art document the revolution in industrial design
fostered by the coming of age of plastics.
</P>
<P>
   Through the centuries, similar creative leaps followed the
development of newly discovered materials from iron and bronze to
steel and aluminum. Plastic presented new opportunities for
designers because of certain of its properties: It is lightweight,
translucent and sometimes transparent; it can be molded or cast
into quirky shapes as well as drawn into filaments for textile
fibers.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the invention of plastic, a whole new esthetic developed
with shapes and forms in synthetic colors that were commercially
viable,'' said Scott Reilly, the show's guest curator.
</P>
<P>
   Founded on the wave of Pop art and the emerging space age,
designer plastic mimicked features of both (remember the television
set in the shape of an astronaut's helmet?). Designers turned to
plastic to create furniture, lighting fixtures, decorative
household products, electronic equipment and women's fashions.
</P>
<P>
   For a decade, the manufacture of such lively and idiosyncratic
objects burgeoned both in this country and abroad, but it came to
an abrupt end with the oil crisis of 1973. Petroleum was the raw
material of plastic, and the cost of production, already high as
manufacturers struggled to recover start-up investments and
shipping charges, pushed the price of many of these objects beyond
the means of the average consumer.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's designer, Shauna Mosseri, has created an
installation that emphasizes each object's peculiarities. The walls
are painted a luminescent pale green, and some of the wares are
displayed on shelves of three-dimensional aluminum grids; other
objects are suspended from the grids.
</P>
<P>
   And Reilly has organized the objects around themes that relate
to their functions. The first group, modular designs, may be viewed
as a kind of Lego for adults: objects made of interlocking parts
that can be arranged as an owner sees fit.
</P>
<P>
   One modular room divider, designed by Pierluigi Spadolini and
Paolo Felli, is composed of white cylinders arranged vertically. It
doubles as a screen of light when certain cylinders are uncapped
and light bulbs are inserted.
</P>
<P>
   A shelving unit by Olaf Von Bohr, consisting of 11 elements in
yellow and orange plastic, and a stackable tableware service for
six by Massimo Vignelli are both examples of space-saving compact
units.
</P>
<P>
   Chairs from this period are molded to conform to the human body
in ways their cousins in wood or steel do not. Viewers are invited
to sit in Eero Aarnio's low Pastil chair, a cross between an
oversize M&AMP;M and a miniature spacecraft, to judge for themselves
its comfort. His red tomato chair would be a perfect foil for a
woman dressed in the red vinyl jumper, exhibited nearby, which
Courreges designed in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Nyguen Manh Khanh's transparent bubble of a chair is actually
called Aerospace, and it allows its occupant to be completely
enveloped and visible at the same time. And Verner Panton's orange
Cantilever chair was one fluid organic design from back to seat to
base.
</P>
<P>
   Light fixtures of this period were ingenious combinations of
translucent and opaque materials. Vico Magistretti's table lamp
called Mezzachimera has vertical folds of opaline Plexiglas that
appear like waves of light, while in his Telegono lamp, a half
globe swivels to serve as either shade or diffuser.
</P>
<P>
   Umbrella stands inspired many different designs, from a series
of rings attached to a post to a dome-shape object with holes,
which in smaller sizes could be used as a vase or a pencil cup. But
nothing in the show is as outrageous or endearing as Ettore
Sottsass' red typewriter for Olivetti called Valentine.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion designers followed suit with entire dresses and coats
made of plastic. A runway of mannequins dressed in these designs
completes the picture of this experimental era. The couture outfits
were selected by another curator, Susan Rubin, to show how even the
cheapest plastic could also be used artistically.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Cardin was in the forefront with his red vinyl coat that
also looked like a tomato. Like the furniture on view, Rudi
Gernreich's hot pink wool ensemble with a fetching clear plastic
insert down the middle and matching leggings was playful and
practical at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, he summed up the period and its innovative fashions by
saying, ``A woman can be anything she wants to be _ a Gainsborough
or a Reynolds or a Reynolds Wrap.'' Actually, he meant Saran Wrap.

 &HT;    Family, friends disbelieve wrongdoing of slain man in hotel
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Ga. _ If Phillip Dover was into anything dirty, it
certainly didn't show.
</P>
<P>
   The flashiest thing about the 31-year-old bachelor, his friends
said Tuesday, was his red convertible _ but it was a 9-year-old
Chevy Cavalier.
</P>
<P>
   His father, his boss and his former roommate all said the same
thing _ his execution-style slaying at the Atlanta Hilton had to be
a matter of ``being in the wrong place at the wrong time.''
</P>
<P>
   Dover roomed with Scott Shope, another dispatcher at GTO 2000,
until August, when Shope got married and Dover moved into a
two-bedroom apartment with a another friend, Chris Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Shope said he was the first in Gainesville to learn of Dover's
death, Atlanta detectives, he said, found a prescription bottle in
the hotel room with Phillip's name on it. They contacted the
pharmacy which issued it, and were given the telephone number at
Shope's house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phillip was as average as you could be,'' Shope said. ``He was
a big sports fan, he liked to shoot pool, he hung out at places
like Damon's and Chili's and Appleby's.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He hung out with the same people, did the same things. Once I
told him, 'You're as predictable as my grandfather.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Before going to work at GTO, Dover was a bartender at Appleby's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phillip never had any money,'' Shope said. ``He dated various
girls, but no one special. I lived with him for two years, and he
certainly kept it well hidden if he was into anything bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Dover's roommate, Chris Anderson, who works for a Gainesville
bank, arranged time off and, Shope said, went to stay with his
parents. ``He told me he's not going to live in that apartment any
more. He's going to move. The idea of living there doesn't give him
a comfortable feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Phillip was basically a kind, gentle person,'' said Tom
Cornett, who runs GTO. ``He was a real good'' employee. Fornett
said his 20-person staff is eligible for weekly bonuses based upon
work performance and ``Phillip qualified for the bonuses 98 percent
of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornett would not say how much Phillip made, but he said
dispatchers in general ``are well-paid. Some dispatchers make more
than college professors.''
</P>
<P>
   Dover was ``quite a ladies' man,'' Cornett said. ``He was a
great trivia player, too. He was just a good all-around guy. We'll
miss him in more ways than one.''
</P>
<P>
   Dover's father Clarence, who lives outside Gainesville, called
Phillip ``a good man, a good son, a good child.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago he got a DUI,'' the elder Dover said. ``That's
all the trouble he's ever been in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He never had a lot of cash,'' Dover said, ``and I'm not sure
he even had a credit card. He lived from paycheck to paycheck.''
</P>
<P>
   Dover said both he and his son were born in Atlanta. They moved
to Hall County in the 1970s, and Phillip graduated from East Hall
High School. After his parents divorced, the younger Dover spent
seven years with his mother in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he moved back here and stayed with us for a while before
he went out on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a senseless thing that happened to my son,'' Dover
said. ``I'm ashamed to say I'm from Atlanta.''

 &HT;    Election dramas unfold across the countryBy Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ With legislative reapportionment likely to
determine control of Congress in the new millennium, some of the
fall's most competitive and expensive elections are unfolding in
state legislatures around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Well beneath the radar of the congressional campaigns, the two
national parties are spending millions of dollars in about a dozen
states where a gain or loss of a few seats could give one party
control of the state house or senate chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hand-to-hand combat out there,'' says Kevin Mack,
director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC).
``Partisan control is on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Term limits, creating an unprecedented number of open seats in
some states, is also feeding the frenzy. Here in the Razorback
State, half of the 100-member House is open because of term limits,
giving Republicans the best opportunity to pick up seats in the
Democratically controlled legislature ``since union troops left
Little Rock and the allowed the former confederate soldiers to vote
again,'' says Arkansas GOP director Richard Bearden.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan, where Democrats are clinging to a four-seat
majority in the state House, 64 of the state's 110 House seats are
open this year because of term limits. The state parties and
related committees there are spending ``millions and millions of
dollars'' for control of the chamber, says Mark Brewer, chairman of
the Michigan Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans, of course, have immediate objectives
in wanting to control state legislative chambers. But the
overarching impetus at the national level is the redistricting that
will take place in 2001 as a result of the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   The parties that control the legislatures and the governor's
offices after the 2000 elections will redraw the district
boundaries for Congress. How the lines are drawn can determine
which party will be able to send more of their members to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The national parties aren't waiting until 2000 to launch their
offensives on state legislatures, figuring that it will be easier
for their members to win in 2000 if they are running as incumbents
elected this year.
</P>
<P>
   Three states that send the most members to Congress --
California, Illinois and Texas -- all have legislative chambers
that could change hands with the gain or loss of a few seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm spending a ton of money in California,'' says Rep. John
Linder (R-Ga.), chairman of the National Republican Campaign
Committee (NRCC), which spearheads the House GOP campaign effort.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Linder's NRCC is spending nearly $2 million in state
legislative races. Linder sums up the reason for the investment in
one word: reapportionment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be huge to control one or both bodies and even
better if we control the governors' offices,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mack, who coordinates the Democratic Party's effort from
Washington, declined to disclose what the DLCC is spending this
year. ``People are just working as hard as they can to keep these
legislative chambers,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're basically talking about setting the rules of the game
for the next ten years,'' says political scientist Gary Moncrief at
Boise State University, who teaches state legislative politics.
``Whoever controls that has really got a leg up.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, who control a majority of the nation's legislative
chambers, have the most at stake. With the GOP now controlling both
houses of Congress and 32 of 50 of the nation's governor's offices,
state legislatures are the last repository of Democratic strength.
</P>
<P>
   And that strength has been eroding steadily, thanks in a large
part to the huge Republican gains in the South. Since 1974,
Democrats controlled 68 percent of all state legislative seats. Now
they control just 53 percent. In the South, the erosion has been
even more dramatic. In 1974, Democrats controlled 86 percent of all
legislative seats in the region. Today, they control 62 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are also facing some bad precedent. The party of the
president has lost legislative seats in every mid-term election in
the past 20 years except one.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Republicans have a realistic chance of gaining
control of a majority of the nation's 7,424 legislative seats for
the first time since 1952, says Tim Storey, research analyst for
the National Conference of State Legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really the final act of realignment,'' says Storey.
``Democrats really dominated state legislatures if you look at the
last 20 years. Now you have a number of states where Republicans
are optimistic and have realistic shots to take state chambers.''
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, the NRCC is spending about $100,000 to erase the
Democrats' 10-seat majority in the state Senate. ``We've got a real
shot,'' says state GOP chairman Rusty Paul.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia is a good example of another trend that is reshaping the
way state legislative battles are fought. In recent years,
strategic planning and fund raising was a largely parochial affair,
with the respective party leaders from the House and Senate calling
the shots.
</P>
<P>
   Now, legislative campaigns have become centralized in the state
parties, with strategic advice and money flowing directly from the
national parties. This year in Georgia, for example, the state
Republican Party is coordinating statewide television advertising
for its candidates for the first time ever.
</P>
<P>
   The result are campaigns that are far more professional than the
candidates could have ever undertaken on their own, Paul says.
</P>
<P>
   The DLCC, founded in 1993, this year is providing professional
support to 37 legislative chambers, from polling to fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happened in the past is these have been lackluster
operations with legislative leaders raising $10,000 to $15,000 and
passing out $500 checks to incumbents,'' Mack says. ``Now they are
$500,000 to $1 million efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   THE BALANCE OF POWER
</P>
<P>
   Control of one or both chambers of many state legislatures is up
for grabs in the November election. A gain or loss of a few seats
in many cases will mean a change of partisan control. The number in
center column indicates how many seats the minority party must win
to gain control.

ISRAEL SAYS GRENADE ATTACK SUSPECT CONFESSED TO SPATE OF RECENT
ATTACKS   
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DEBORAH SONTAG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The Palestinian arrested in the grenade assault on
Monday that wounded 67 Israelis, including 24 soldiers, has
confessed to a spate of recent terrorist incidents, Israeli army
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Salem Rajab al-Sarsour, 29, an Islamic militant,
admitted the assault on the Beersheba bus terminal, a similar
grenade attack late last month on an army post in Hebron and the
fatal stabbing of an elderly rabbi, also in Hebron, in late August,
the Israeli officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Sarsour described the attack on the bus station, which disrupted
the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks in Maryland and became the
subject of international attention, as an impulsive act born of
frustration, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The grenades were intended for a terrorist attack in Jerusalem,
the Israeli officials said. But Sarsour, who had traveled to
Beersheba to seek construction work, was so frustrated by his
failed search that he hurled the grenades at the terminal, where he
was to have caught a bus home. He was caught and pummeled by a bus
driver, who turned him over to the police.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli officials said Sarsour, a father of five who lives
in the Palestinian-controlled sector of Hebron, has been active for
years in Hamas, the Islamic fundamentalist group.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday the armed wing of Hamas claimed responsibility for
the attack. In a fax to Reuters here the group, the Izz el-Deen
al-Qassam Brigade, said, ``One of our heroic fighters carried out a
heroic operation on Monday morning in the town of Beersheba which
targeted a crowd of enemy soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Palestinian security official, Jibril Rajoub, however,
said Sarsour had committed ``an individual act.'' Rajoub said the
bombing should not reflect negatively on the Palestinians'
commitment to cracking down on terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis say that is the deal-breaking issue in the peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
   In Beersheba, officials said, Sarsour lobbed two grenades at the
terminal in the morning rush hour, wounding the soldiers, who were
returning to their base, and 43 civilians. One victim, 47, remains
in critical condition Tuesday. Four others were in serious
condition, and 20 remained hospitalized for superficial shrapnel
wounds.
</P>
<P>
   In late August, in another act that officials said had not been
planned, Sarsour killed the rabbi, Shlomo Raanan, 67, in the Tel
Rumeida settlement, they said. The officials added that Sarsour had
told interrogators that he had planned to throw Molotov cocktails
at an army post near Tel Rumeida, but found it vacant.
</P>
<P>
   Climbing the fence of the Jewish settlement, he spied the rabbi
through the window of his mobile home, broke in, stabbed Raanan to
death and fled back to Palestinian-controlled Hebron, the Israelis
said.
</P>
<P>
   Days later, the Israeli officials said, Sarsour reported the
killing to Hamas officials, who inducted him into the elite
military wing and taught him grenade throwing.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 30, Yom Kippur, Sarsour launched a grenade attack on an
army post in Hebron, wounding 14 Israeli soldiers and 8 Palestinian
passers-by, the Israelis said.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis have arrested four suspected accomplices. The
Palestinians said they had arrested two more.
</P>
<P>
   In another twist the Palestinians asserted that Sarsour, even if
he had acted independently in Beersheba, was a double agent for
Hamas and for Israeli security, Israeli army radio reported Tuesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians said two of his accomplices had revealed his
double role in videotaped interrogation. The videos have been flown
to the peace talks in Maryland, the army radio said.

 &HT;    Tech new to the 'big game;' FSU used to them
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Game of the Decade? Perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   Game of the Century? That would be a strech.
</P>
<P>
   But given what's on the line _ first place in the ACC, a
possible spot in the Bowl Championship Series and an outside shot
at competing for the national championship _ Saturday's meeting
between No. 20 Georgia Tech and No. 6 Florida State will be the
biggest game played in Bobby Dodd Stadium in a long time.
</P>
<P>
   And given where Georgia Tech's football program was in 1994
(1-10), its players, coaches and fans are justified in viewing
Saturday's contest as a possible watershed game on the way back to
respectibility.
</P>
<P>
   At Florida State, the view is significantly different.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big game, no doubt about it, but at Florida State we
play three or four of these every year,'' said Ross Brannon, a
sophomore offensive tackle. ``We're used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tallahassee, it's been a running joke that Florida State
plays in a ``Game of the Century'' at least once a year. In the
1980s, it was usually against Miami. In the '90s, it has been
against the Florida Gators. And here lately, some of the Seminoles'
ACC brethren have elevated their programs enough to challenge their
dominance of the conference.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, Florida State's players say, they love a
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, it was North Carolina, ranked in the Top 10 all
season. Throughout the summer of '97, Florida State's players
constantly read and heard from the North Carolina media that this
was the year that the Tar Heels would unseat them from the ACC
throne. North Carolina would win, they said, because the Tar Heel
defense was superior to the great unit at Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   It was a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 8, No. 2 Florida State went to Chapel Hill to play No. 5
North Carolina in what was billed as the biggest game in the
history of the ACC. It was never a contest, as the Seminole defense
had nine quarterback sacks and won 20-3. The game wasn't that
close.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a perfect example of the way our guys step up in
the big game, especially when they are challenged by somebody,''
quarterback Chris Weinke said. ``Anytime you challenge our defense,
watch out.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season, Miami had the poor judgment to throw down
the gauntlet to the Florida State offense. After a few down
seasons, the Hurricane had a competitive team _ and they had the
Seminoles in the Orange Bowl on Oct. 10. Several members of the
Miami secondary, most notably cornerback Leonard Myers, stated
publicly that they were going to shut down Peter Warrick, the
Seminoles' All-America receiver candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Another challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick had seven catches for 190 yards and punctuated his
performance with a 62-yard touchdown catch.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes Georgia Tech, fresh off an emotional 41-38 win over
Virginia, with a group of eager players getting ready for the
biggest game of their lives. The Yellow Jackets, one would hope,
will have the good sense not to issue any bulletin-board material
that might motivate the Seminoles further.
</P>
<P>
   But they really don't need it. Because of its 24-7 loss to
N.C.State on Sept. 12, Florida State has no margin for error. The
Seminoles must win if they want to claim their seventh ACC title in
a row. Getting back into contention for the national title is a
long shot, anyway, but if Florida State loses to Georgia Tech, it
will have no shot. It would be an unaccustomed feeling for a
program that for 11 consecutive seasons has won 10 or more games
and finished in the final top four nationally.
</P>
<P>
   In short, another challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is riding on this game; we know that,'' defensive
tackle Jerry Johnson said. ``We can't slip up any more. We're
playing on the road on national television. That's about as big as
it gets.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida State's players think their big-game experience is a
significant advantage as they prepare to come to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, if you haven't played in a big game, you choke
under the pressure,'' Brannon said. ``I didn't play well at North
Carolina last year because I had never experienced it. The seniors
knew how to handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``On a week like this, the adrenalin is higher and the coaches
are more uptight than normal. You can just feel it,'' Weinke said.
``Some guys have never played in that kind of atmosphere and don't
know how to adjust. They crumble under the pressure. Our guys are
in this situation year in and year out. They know what to expect.''
</P>
<P>
   What Florida State expects Saturday night at Bobby Dodd Stadium
is a packed house screaming at the top of its lungs. They expect to
get Georgia Tech's very best shot in a game that could set up a
magical season should the Yellow Jackets win. They expect just
about everything and everybody to be against them.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and they also expect to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the kind of games you live for,'' said defensive
back Tay Cody, a sophomore from Blakely. ``I can't wait.''

 &HT;    Wildcat defense putting more pressure on offenses
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Kentucky coach Hal Mumme has earned the reputation
of a gambler, with his penchant of lighting up the skies and taking
several risks on offense. Now, the Wildcats are taking some chances
on defense, too.
</P>
<P>
   In Mumme's first season in Lexington a year ago, Kentucky ranked
sixth nationally in total offense, but the Wildcats came away with
only a 5-6 record. The problems were on defense, where the 'Cats
ranked at the bottom of the SEC, allowing 392.2 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Kentucky defensive coordinator Mike Major, who
worked with Mumme at Valdosta State for five years, has installed a
``Black Flag'' defense designed to put more pressure on opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Major returned only five starters from last year's much-maligned
unit; Kentucky has 16 freshmen or sophomores on defense on its
two-deep depth chart. But the 'Cats are making some strides _ in
wins, if not statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats enter Saturday's SEC East showdown against No. 11
Georgia with a 5-2 record, but they're still ranked next-to-last in
the league in total defense, allowing 392.4 yards per game,
slightly more than last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think their defense gives them a little better pressure,''
Georgia coach Jim Donnan said. ``Last year, they played a lot more
soft coverage. The biggest difference is results. They're stopping
teams and keeping them out of the end zone a little better, but
they're still giving up a lot of yards and points.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia is ranked fifth in the league in total offense, gaining
more than 388 yards per game. But Georgia looked fine-tuned in only
three of its first six games _ against Kent, LSU and Vanderbilt.
</P>
<P>
   On defense, Mumme has accepted the mindset that if an opponent
is going to score, it's going to do it quickly, so he can get his
high-powered offense and quarterback Tim Couch back on the field.
In a 51-35 loss to Florida on Sept. 26, Kentucky surrendered three
touchdowns in a span of only 2 minutes, 22 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky is pressing more in its secondary, with the two
cornerbacks playing bump-and-run coverage. The Wildcats are
blitzing on nearly every play with either a linebacker or safety
and have 15 sacks in seven games, including five in last week's
39-36 upset at LSU.
</P>
<P>
   That's what apparently has Donnan confident heading into the
game, the first of three road trips in a row for the Bulldogs. ``If
they play us like they've played everybody else, we might throw as
many passes as they do,'' Donnan said. ``The man coverage just
presents you a lot of opportunities. We give them a little bit more
of a defensive dilemma than maybe some other teams do.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Freshman quarterback Quincy) Carter can run and he can run
the option. It's hard to defend in that man coverage when you can
do that. We feel like what we've set our package up to be will be
effective against them.''

 &HT;    Feds investigate Martin
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli and Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Tony Martin is under
federal investigation and suspected of laundering drug profits for
longtime friend and convicted narcotics trafficker Rickey Brownlee,
Martin's attorney said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has contacted me in an official capacity, but I've
heard it from enough people to believe it,'' attorney Kieran Fallon
said. ``The U.S. attorney's office doesn't usually send
correspondence to someone detailing an investigation, but there's
something there.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've talked to family, friends, acquaintances ... so you
know what's going on. On the other hand, I have no reason to
believe Tony has done anything illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who was traded to Atlanta from San Diego on June 3, is
being investigated by at least two federal agencies, the U.S.
Attorney's Office in Miami and the Drug Enforcement Administration.
Martin's name also is included in a pending FBI file on Brownlee,
who is from Opa-locka, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Asked earlier this week if he is the subject of an
investigation, Martin said: ``I just don't know. I really don't
know.'' Martin denied that he is part of any drug-laundering
scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was a student at Miami Northwestern High School when he
met Brownlee, who was dating Martin's aunt. The men remained
friends despite an eight-year age difference.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 10, a few weeks after Brownlee's arrest, Martin signed a
retainer in which he agreed to pay Brownlee's attorney, Milton
Hirsch, $175,000 for Brownlee's legal fees. A few days later, about
the same time that authorities subpoenaed his financial records,
Martin stopped payment on the check. Hirsch sued for breach of
contract, but he might drop the action if he is removed from
Brownlee's defense, which could happen by the end of his month.
</P>
<P>
   Martin confirmed that the money was to help cover Brownlee's
legal expenses. ``I wanted to help (Brownlee), but my lawyer said
that wouldn't be a smart thing to do, because it would get me into
the papers,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Brownlee, 41, faces seven counts of heroin and cocaine
trafficking charges and is scheduled for a February 1999 trial on
charges dating to the mid-1980s. When Brownlee was arrested in
January, he was driving a black Mercedes SL-500 that was leased in
Martin's name, according to the U.S. attorney's office. That car is
an element in the money-laundering allegations that were added in
August.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities have subpoenaed Martin's financial records,
but Fallon emphasized that they have neither questioned Martin nor
requested to interview him. Fallon said it is not unusual for a
person under investigation not to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Aiello, vice president of public relations for the NFL,
said the league is aware of the allegations. ``We are following it
through our security people, and that is all I can say on the
matter,'' Aiello said. He did note that ``improper associations''
by any league player would be ``a cause for concern'' that could
lead to action by the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who will continue to play, hasn't allowed the situation
to affect him on the field. He leads the Falcons in receptions (27)
and receiving yards (492) and has three scoring catches. San Diego
officials said they were unaware of any allegations against Martin
when he was traded to the Falcons for a second-round choice in the
1999 draft.
</P>
<P>
   Brownlee is a south Florida businessman who owns a popular
restaurant, a car wash and several other buildings in and around
Opa-locka. He was convicted twice in the 1980s of cocaine
trafficking and has spent seven years in prison. He reportedly
moved 80 to 100 kilos of cocaine weekly, but authorities have had
difficulty tracing the profits.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI file alleges ties between Brownlee and Central American
and South American drug lords. The portion of the file on Martin
has been marked ``secret'' and is accessible only to selected FBI
personnel. An FBI spokesman said that is common practice in many
cases that include allegations against a high-profile personality.
</P>
<P>
   In the money-laundering charges, prosecutors contend that
Brownlee conspired with persons ``known and unknown to the grand
jury'' to conceal profit from a drug operation.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives for two federal agencies said more charges could
be added soon, with ``superseding indictments'' possible within the
next month. From the Federal Detention Center in Miami, Brownlee
said Martin had come to his aid but perhaps backed off when he
became part of the federal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony is one of the best (people around), but when the feds
turned up the heat on him, he did what most people would do,'' said
Brownlee, who declined to discuss his case or any alleged
involvement by Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities might attempt to force Hirsch to testify in
the Brownlee case and on the fee arrangement with Martin. It is not
unusual for a third party to agree to such payments in drug-related
cases, Hirsch said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (federal authorities) have put attorneys on notice,''
Hirsch said. ``If you have the temerity to represent someone in a
drug case, then the fees you collect are going to be scrutinized.
You're behind the eight ball. I said to (Brownlee), `Is there a
white knight?' He turned to Martin. But I should add that all I
know about Martin are two things: He is a friend of Brownlee, and
he owes me $175,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Fallon declined comment when asked if his client exercised poor
judgment in agreeing to aid Brownlee.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Martin said, ``At one time, he very much
helped me when I didn't have the things I have now. He helped me go
back to college. He kept money in my pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin said he regretted that he might not be able to help his
longtime friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could still help him,'' Martin said. ``And I would
help him if I could, if I knew I wouldn't come under so much
scrutiny.''

 &HT;    Aiming for East Lake: Much on the line as Championship nears
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It might decide the money title. It could determine
the PGA Tour Player of the Year. It will distribute $4 million
among 30 players.
</P>
<P>
   Not too shabby for East Lake Golf Club's return to the pro golf
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Next week's Tour Championship is about to complete its
invitation list. After Sunday's conclusion to the final full-field
event of the PGA Tour season, the National Rental Car Classic, the
top 30 money-winners will be determined and the East Lake field
decided.
</P>
<P>
   Which means Billy Payne, the tournament's general chairman, is
stirring, on a smaller scale, those same emotions last affected by
the Olympic Games. In some ways, Payne has even more anticipation,
because this is a game that both excites and exhausts him. He
didn't have a lot of experience in synchronized swimming or the
balance beam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm obsessed by the game,'' Payne said Tuesday. ``While not
very good at it, I love it dearly. ... I kind of have the same kind
of feeling with the Olympics. I didn't care who won, just so the
competition was close.''
</P>
<P>
   David Duval has a chance to make neither the money title nor the
player-of-the-year voting very close at all. With $720,000
available for first prize at East Lake, the former Georgia Tech
player ($2,464,408) is leading No. 2 Jim Furyk, who is passing up
the National Car Rental at Disney World after winning at Las Vegas,
by $644,074. With a fifth victory, at Disney, Duval probably could
end all the discussions. In that case, O'Meara probably would need
to win the Tour Championship to outvote Duval for player of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   East Lake member Stewart Cink of Smyrna is stuck at the 31st
spot, trailing No. 30 Andrew Magee by $61,867. Magee last year
grabbed the 30th spot on the final day, by $5 over Atlanta's Billy
Andrade (now 42nd). Cink probably needs at least a fifth at Disney,
which would earn $80,000. If Magee plays well, Cink might require a
third and $136,000. Andrade needs a first ($360,000) or perhaps a
second ($216,000) to make it.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Watson has made a confusing move, deciding against an
appearance at Disney despite a tenuous situation at No. 29, less
than $7,000 ahead of Magee. If Watson misses the Tour Championship,
he will not have satisfied his minimum 15 events and will lose
pension points and player voting status for 1999. That could be
noteworthy, considering that Watson is an active voice in player
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Tournament officials are winding down preparations, hopeful that
a cool snap to the weather remains moderate. Payne on Sunday will
hold a ``greenside chat'' with his 1,000 volunteers, who will park
at Turner Field as a dry run for tournament week, shuttle to the
course and then celebrate later with a volunteer party.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets available
</P>
<P>
   A limited number of weekly ($120) and daily tickets ($40) remain
for next week's Tour Championship at East Lake Golf Club and can be
purchased by calling 1-888-868-7849.
</P>
<P>
   The event is expected to be sold out by Friday, with a cutoff of
20,000 tickets for each of the four rounds, Thursday through
Sunday. A limited number of group packages also are available at
404-378-7687.
</P>
<P>
   Practice round tickets, which are good for any or all of the
three days (Monday-Wednesday) are $25 and can be purchased by phone
or at the gate.
</P>
<P>
   All parking is at Turner Field. Parking and shuttles, about 10
minutes to East Lake, are free.

 &HT;    O'Meara: Duval equally deserving
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Masters and British Open wins in the same season no
longer guarantee Mark O'Meara the PGA Tour Player of the Year
award. That comes from a good source _ O'Meara himself. On a
conference call Tuesday before next week's Tour Championship,
O'Meara, citing four victories and more than $2.4 million earned by
David Duval, said, ``I would obviously love to win it, but I can't
say that I just deserve it outright. If he (Duval) goes on to win
another tournament, I'd probably vote for him myself.'' As a
prelude to the Tour Championship, both players are competing in
this week's National Car Rental Classic at Walt Disney World, with
Duval the defending champion. A partner with Duval in last year's
President's Cup, where they went 3-0, O'Meara said, ``I truly
believed when he won (Kingsmill), he maybe deserved the player of
the year as much or more than I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Three-tour challenge
</P>
<P>
   Allen Doyle is a rarity, playing this year on all three tours
under commissioner Tim Finchem's umbrella _ PGA Tour, Senior PGA
Tour and Nike Tour. With the combined earnings from all three,
Doyle has made a pretty solid $193,953, not including the $15,000
he won for taking a Senior Series event in Albany. Doyle's biggest
Senior Tour check came Sunday in Sacramento with a tie for fourth
in the Raley's Gold Rush Classic; the $54,000 pushed his season
total to $144,018 (69th) for only five events (a $28,804 average).
Hoping to move beyond lobbying each week for sponsor exemptions,
Doyle will go through Senior PGA Tour qualifying school. Regional
play is Nov. 9-13, with the finals Dec. 1-4 in Haines City, Fla.
Only the top eight gain fully exempt status for 1999. Marietta's
Joe Inman, who is 42nd on the money list with $396,502, would have
to win to make the top 31 for full exemption but probably will
qualify for at least 20 events just by making the top 50.
</P>
<P>
   Langer joins Sarazen field
</P>
<P>
   Squeezed out of some attention by the presence of the Tour
Championship, the Subaru Sarazen World Open nonetheless has
assembled a strong field for its final tournament Nov. 5-8 at
Chateau Elan. Added to the field this week was Germany's Bernhard
Langer, the two-time Masters champion. Squire's picks already have
gone to PGA Tour players Payne Stewart, Craig Stadler, John Huston,
Brad Faxon, John Daly and Tom Kite; and European Tour players
Andrew Coltart, Mathias Gronberg, Padraig Harrington, Miguel Angel
Jimenez, Paul McGinley and Peter O'Malley. Other Americans playing
include defending champion Mark Calcavecchia, Smyrna's Stewart
Cink, No. 2 PGA Tour moneywinner Jim Furyk, Bob Friendb Dudley Hart
and former Tech player Tripp Isenhour.
</P>
<P>
   Chip shots
</P>
<P>
   A two-time champion at Walt Disney World, Marietta's Larry
Nelson has gone back with the young studs for a week and is playing
in the PGA Tour's National Car Rental Classic at Lake Buena Vista,
Fla. . . . Alpharetta's Kelly Blackburn, the trainer for Nelson and
several other tour players, is hosting ``The Fitness Center,'' a
new, weekly addition to the PGA Tour's Web site
(http://www.pgatour.com). . . . A two-hour documentary, ``Arnold
Palmer: Golf's Heart and Soul,'' premiers Oct. 28 on The Golf
Channel. The 69-year-old Palmer, meanwhile, has been undergoing
radiation treatments in Latrobe, Pa., as a precautionary move after
his prostate-cancer surgery last year. Palmer's golf buddies at
Latrobe Country Club can't wait until the treatments are done. He
shot a 63 recently. . . . Ahead of his rehabilitation schedule
after right-shoulder surgery in April, Greg Norman will play in his
Shark Shootout Nov. 13-15 in Thousand Oaks, Calif. . . . Oakland
Hill Country Club near Detroit was selected as the site for the
2003 Ryder Cup matches, beating out favored Colonial C.C.

 &HT;    Soccer notebook: Usual settings for DC
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The weather conditions were familiar for D.C. United,
if not ideal. The rainy, slushy field at Ohio Stadium on Sunday was
in no worse shape than the venues where they have taken MLS Cup
victories the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But in the final contest played on the narrow 62-yard Ohio State
football field that has been the subject of league-wide griping,
the Columbus Crew kept their footing to earn an impressive 4-2
victory Sunday and send the Eastern Conference finals to a decisive
match today. The game will be shown live on ESPN2 at 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. national team striker Brian McBride, playing on a bad
ankle, had two goals, as United's normally sturdy defense fell
apart early and couldn't hold firm after the visitors got to within
3-2 with 12 minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the rain; it wasn't the field,'' United midfielder
Ben Olsen said. ``It was us.''
</P>
<P>
   United (27-9), which had won 13-straight playoff games, has
never lost in the postseason at RFK Stadium. Columbus (18-18),
which moves to a new 22,500-seat soccer-only stadium next season,
never has won in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   MLS already has lost one top team for the championship match.
The Los Angeles Galaxy, which could have hosted Sunday's MLS Cup at
the Rose Bowl, was ousted in two games by the first-year Chicago
Fire, which won the clincher 2-1 in a shootout Thursday before an
MLS playoff record of 32,744 at Soldier Field.
</P>
<P>
   Rhinos win A-League
</P>
<P>
   The Rochester Raging Rhinos won their first A-League
championship Saturday with a 3-1 victory over the Minnesota Thunder
before a home crowd of 13,722. Darren Tilley had a hat trick for
the Rhinos. . . . U.S. national team midfielder Claudio Reyna, who
threatened to walk out on German Bundesliga side VfL Wolfsburg
after losing his starting position and captaincy, will remain with
the club through the end of the season. Reyna was one of several
starters benched after Wolfsburg, 16th among the 18 teams, got off
to a poor start.
</P>
<P>
   Zidane wants out
</P>
<P>
   French World Cup hero Zinedine Zidane, who feels unwanted with
Italian Serie A champion Juventus, has indicated a desire to go to
another club before his contract runs out in 2003. . . . A total of
11 red cards were issued in Spanish Liga Primera games over the
weekend, including six in the contest between Atletico Madrid and
Tenerife. . . . Andy Cole scored twice as Manchester United got to
within four points of England Premier League leaders Aston Villa
Saturday with a 5-1 romp over Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   They still want his 'Hod'
</P>
<P>
   England manager Glenn Hoddle is denying published reports that
he and captain Alan Shearer exchanged angry words after a 3-0 win
over Luxembourg on Wednesday to improve sagging hopes for
qualifying for Euro 2000. Hoddle came under heavy fire after an
uninspiring 0-0 draw with Bulgaria Oct. 10, with several newspapers
demanding his resignation. . . . European Champions' League
qualifying resumes today, with Inter Milan missing injured Ronaldo
and Roberto Baggio as it tries to stay alive at home against
Spartak Moscow. Also on tap are Sturm Graz at Real Madrid, Brondby
at Manchester United and Dynamo Kiev at Arsenal. The
Barcelona-Bayern Munich match will be shown live at 2:30 p.m. today
on ESPN2, while the network will air the Juventus-Atletico Bilbao
match on tape delay Thursday at 3 p.m.

THEY'RE TACKY ALL RIGHT, DELIRIOUSLY SO  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 25) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By VINCENT CANBY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't be fooled by the family's tacky living quarters outside
Dallas: a cramped, broken-down trailer home whose chief amenities
are a fridge used mostly for beer, a large television set that
seldom shuts up and plastic cutlery accumulated over years of
eating takeout.
</P>
<P>
   The slobbish Ansel Smith, his tarty second wife, Sharla, his
pot-smoking son, Chris, and his 20-year-old still-virginal
daughter, Dottie, haven't abandoned _ nor have they been abandoned
by _ the miraculous American economic juggernaut. They are part of
the system and each, in his or her own way, contributes to the
national weal and woe.
</P>
<P>
   As much as Jeeter Lester and his ``Tobacco Road'' clan were
symptomatic of the Great Depression of the 1930s, the Smith family
reflects the values of the boom years of the 1980s and 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   It's just that the Smiths haven't participated to quite the
degree that made billionaires of those who wheeled and dealed in
savings-and-loan institutions, real estate development and computer
technology. The Smiths are on the bottom rung of the ladder, but at
least they're on it, or so they believe, possibly because
television tells them so.
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the unstated factors giving zest to ``Killer
Joe,'' Tracy Letts' violent, satiric and often dangerously funny
family comedy, now at the SoHo Playhouse Off Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   The new production, a commercial venture starring Scott Glenn
and Amanda Plummer, is being presented in association with the 29th
Street Rep, which produced an earlier, equally effective production
of the play in New York four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ansel Smith (Marc A. Nelson) is an auto mechanic, Sharla (Ms.
Plummer) waitresses at a Pizza Hut, Chris (Mike Shannon) sells dope
whenever he pulls himself together, and Dottie (Sarah Paulson) once
had a job with a chiropodist. Ansel's extended family would also
include his alcoholic ex-wife, Adele, and her boyfriend, Rex. Adele
and Rex are never seen but they become as vivid to the audience as
any of the characters who are.
</P>
<P>
   Presiding over the play, until the Smith family revels get
lethally out of hand, is Killer Joe Cooper (Glenn), a cool, nattily
dressed Dallas police detective who runs a little business on the
side. Other cops might be in laundromats or vending machines; Joe
is in contract murder.
</P>
<P>
   It's Chris who first proposes the plan that propels the play,
mostly because his mother stole the cocaine he was going to sell to
pay off his $6,000 debt to some local hoods. Having learned that
Adele has a $50,000 life insurance policy, of which Dottie is the
sole beneficiary, Chris suggests to his father that they hire
Killer Joe to carry out a contract on her.
</P>
<P>
   Ansel mulls over the idea for a minute or two before deciding
that it might be just the ticket to provide the family with some
much needed cash. Sharla thinks it's a swell idea, and even the
quiet, almost beatific Dottie agrees. She remembers how, when she
was 2, her mom once tried to suffocate her with a pillow.
</P>
<P>
   Problems arise when, during the contract negotiations, Joe
demands his $25,000 payment in advance. Since they scarcely have
enough cash to pay for their Kentucky fried chicken, they are
stymied until Joe proposes a compromise. He's been much taken by
the childlike Dottie. He says that, instead of cash, he will accept
Dottie as a retainer.
</P>
<P>
   This pleases everyone, including Dottie who, in her turn, has
been much taken by the smooth-talking, well-scrubbed detective who
hardly ever uses four-letter words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Killer Joe'' begins like a white-trash cartoon in which
middle-class behavior is turned inside out. The sodden Chris
objects to his stepmother's opening the door to him when she is
wearing nothing below the waist. Sharla points out that it is the
middle of the night and she didn't know who was knocking.
</P>
<P>
   Dottie's virginity is a source of worry. The potbellied Ansel
plods around in gray-tinged briefs in need of a new elastic.
Whenever he tries to act like a father, his attention inevitably
slides over to the more compelling images on the television set.
</P>
<P>
   Though ``Killer Joe'' behaves like a cartoon, its firm dramatic
structure builds to a furious climax that has the punch of reality.
It is both dismaying in its physical and psychological brutality
and horrendously comic. As written by Letts and as beautifully
acted by Mr. Glenn and Ms. Paulson, the courtship of Joe and Dottie
even succeeds in being moving. They are the only characters in the
play who don't traffic in double-crosses.
</P>
<P>
   The director is Wilson Milam, who staged the play's 1993
premiere in Chicago, the first New York production, and successful
runs in London, initially at the Gate Theater and then at the
Vaudeville in the West End. By this time, it is clear that he has
complete control of the exotic material as well as the actors to
realize it.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Plummer's Sharla is a delight, at the beginning a brassily
self-assured trailer park Circe, then a bewildered wreck, while
Shannon's Chris is a perfect, self-pitying lout. Nelson gives the
production's most consistently realized performance as Ansel, but
then he has been doing the role off and on from Chicago through the
London runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Smiths may seem outrageous but, as someone in the play
observes: ``A normal person is just someone you don't know very
well.'' ``Killer Joe'' is an immensely entertaining pop artifact,
written, directed and performed with neon-lit flamboyance. Lift
your Styrofoam cups to toast a hit.

 &HT;    Giving up big plays is secondary's weakness
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Falcons cornerback Ronnie Bradford was caught looking
the wrong way Sunday, and by the time he looked the right way,
Saints receiver Keith Poole was sprinting 64 yards to the end zone
with a touchdown reception.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Saints quarterback Billy Joe) Tolliver was coming out of the
pocket; I'm with the receiver (short) and happened to look at the
quarterback, and the receiver took off,'' said Bradford. ``You got
to know when the quarterback takes off they're going to try to go
deep.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the play hardly mattered. The Falcons beat the
Saints 31-23 to improve to 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   But the tendency to give up the big play has Falcons players and
coaches concerned.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta pass defense is ranked next to last in the NFL,
allowing 260.2 yards per game, and the Jets (3-3), Sunday's
opponent, have the NFL's No. 6 passing offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons also have allowed 10 passing plays of 38 or more
yards, six of 56 or more yards. In a three-game span _ all
victories _ the Falcons have given up pass plays of 72, 46, 39, 64
and 82 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating, because had we eliminated a few of those
passes, we go from being the 25th defense to being about 15th,''
said Rich Brooks, assistant head coach and defensive coordinator.
``But until we execute . . . we will not be one of the best
defenses in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   The same defense has 13 takeaways, including three
interceptions, and has scored in each of Atlanta's last three
victories.
</P>
<P>
   No single play has led to an Atlanta defeat; the 31-20 loss to
the 49ers was the culmination of many. The second play set the
tone, however, when Jerry Rice beat reserve cornerback Juran Bolden
and Robinson for a 66-yard touchdown. Bolden was waived two days
later.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons say the problem is not scheme or talent. It's a
matter of doing the right thing, like guarding deep when opponents
are behind. That's something rookie reserve cornerback Elijah
Williams hasn't done the last two weeks, while allowing touchdown
passes of 39 and 82 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (pass) rush also plays a role,'' Brooks said. ``We didn't
wrap up Billy Joe when we had him (on the play to Poole), and we
got caught peeking in the backfield. We've got to give up (the
short passes), and let the clock run. There's no excuse with
four-deep coverage to get run by when you're up two TDs in the last
four minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to the players,'' said cornerback Ray Buchanan, the
team leader with three interceptions. ``You can't make too many
adjustments by cutting players because of the salary cap. Right
now, we're doing poor, but we're winning. Don't forget that. We're
5-1, and we've got time to get it right.''

 &HT;    Data delivery boosts BellSouth's revenue
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth Corp.'s high-speed data business grew
sharply during the past three months, and its traditional telephone
business remained strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The third quarter proved once again that BellSouth's growth
has momentum,'' said Duane Ackerman, the company's chairman and
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for the Atlanta-based company's data and digital
services, which include such high-speed, high-capacity data network
products as IDSN, T-1 and pathlink, rose 36 percent to $463 million
in the quarter, the company reported Tuesday. A year earlier, the
figure was $340 million.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, revenue for the quarter was $5.87 billion, up from $5.2
billion a year earlier. For nine months, revenue was $16.96
billion, up from $14.96 billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The company reported net income of $814 million, 82 cents a
share, down from $1.19 billion, or $1.19 a share, a year earlier.
Last year's figures included one-time income from the sale of ITT
World Directories and Optus Communications.
</P>
<P>
   For nine months, net income was $2.52 billion, down from $2.53
billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   After data, the next-biggest increase in business for the
quarter came from add-on features to regular telephone service.
This includes such services as Caller ID and MemoryCall. Sales for
these features rose 20 percent in the quarter to $421 million.
</P>
<P>
   Regular local telephone service remains BellSouth's
bread-and-butter business. It reported third-quarter revenue of
$2.38 billion from local service _ by far the company's largest
single segment. The figure last year was $2.14 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company added 94,000 residential access lines in the
quarter. Those lines were used for Internet access, fax machines
and second telephones for teenagers, among other things. The
company estimates that one in seven of its customers now have at
least two telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   While huge, the number of new lines adds to an already-big
customer base and represents only a 4.2 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   That's why BellSouth has been branching out into new lines of
business such as high-speed data and international wireless phones.
Wireless cable TV remains small and is not yet broken out
separately.
</P>
<P>
   The company hopes these areas will offset the slowing rate of
growth for its maturing traditional telephone business.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The playwright's fading family photographs hang virtually
unnoticed on the walls of the set. In one frame, a black World War
II soldier grins beneath a rakishly tilted cap. In another, a shy
young woman glimmers in a gown that sweeps her toes. They are his
parents, long buried, their era long gone.
</P>
<P>
   But when the stage lights dim, their lost world springs to life.
Suddenly, it is 1943 in Harlem, with Ella Fitzgerald crooning,
newly arrived Southerners gawking and housekeepers calling to Jesus
in storefront churches and lindy-hopping until dawn at the Savoy
Ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   The playwright John Henry Redwood recreates those heady days in
``The Old Settler,'' a bittersweet comedy in previews Off Broadway
at Primary Stages, where it opens on Wednesday. It is the story of
Elizabeth Borny, a lonely, middle-aged domestic who rents a room in
her apartment to a naive young Southerner and falls in love with
him, despite the disapproval of her sister, Quilly, who knows
better.
</P>
<P>
   In bringing this slice of black America to a New York stage,
Redwood has woven a tale from the lives of his relatives who
migrated from North Carolina to New York, scrubbed floors on Long
Island and partied in Harlem during the 1940s. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  The play, directed by Harold Scott and starring the actress
and singer Leslie Uggams as Elizabeth, has won praise in different
productions at regional theaters.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters, Elizabeth and Quilly (portrayed by Lynda Gravatt),
are loosely modeled on Redwood's mother and aunt, who bickered and
quarreled in foot-stomping battles and loved each other fiercely
until they died. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  As a boy growing up in Brooklyn, Redwood absorbed their
stories, their love of collard greens and Big Band sounds, and
their reverence for a time when young men tipped their hats to
young women, and when saying ``shoot'' was the closest one came to
swearing in polite company.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Redwood eventually left home to satisfy a variety of
curiosities. Entranced by John Wayne's performance in the movie
``Sands of Iwo Jima,'' he joined the Marines for three years. He
earned master's degrees in history and religion. He even tinkered
with computers on Wall Street before becoming an actor (appearing
in the Broadway production of ``The Piano Lesson'' by August
Wilson) and writing plays. (``Got four full-length plays
produced,'' Redwood said, laughing, ``and 150 in the drawer.'')
</P>
<P>
   His mother was dead by the time he completed ``The Old Settler''
in 1994, and so were his father, his grandmother and many of the
old-timers. But their voices and their music lingered in his memory
and echoed in his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sa-tan, we're gonna tear your kingdom do-own,'' sang Redwood
softly, as he perched on the stage during a recent rehearsal, his
baritone rumbling through the words of an old spiritual sung by his
mother's church choir. ``Whoa-ho, Sa-tan, we're gonna tear your
kingdom down ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the voices I heard growing up,'' said the author,
who appears to be in his 50s but declined to divulge his age,
saying that as an actor he does not want to be typecast in
age-specific roles. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  ``Nineteen forty-three was my parents' period,'' he continued,
``when they were young, when it was more the norm to be respectful
to women, more the norm to look out for one another. And when they
went out, they would come up to Harlem, even though they lived in
Brooklyn.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Redwood, who had small roles in the films ``Mr. Holland's
Opus'' and ``Passion Fish,'' said he started writing out of
frustration. The world he knew so well rarely appeared in plays,
movies or on television. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Where were the solid, working-class black families supported
by men like his father, a mechanic and World War II veteran?, he
asked. Where were the characters like his mother and aunt, the
spunky, religious women who inspired his love for the Bible and his
(brief) yearning to become a Baptist preacher?
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us don't walk around screaming and cursing and cutting
and solving our problems with knives or guns, but that's what you
see,'' said Redwood, who has three grown children and a daughter in
high school.
</P>
<P>
   He started dabbling in the theater after falling for an aspiring
actress in an era he calls ``pre-August Wilson.'' So he began
scribbling on the road while performing in regional theaters,
writing ``Mark VIII,'' a play about two mothers, one white, one
black, whose babies are swapped in a hospital; ``A Sunbeam,'' about
a mother's tortured love for her retarded son, and ``Acted Within
Proper Departmental Procedure,'' which chronicles a black police
officer's struggle to balance her work and personal life.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, ``The Old Settler'' caught the attention of Lloyd
Richards, the veteran director who has brought a number of Wilson's
plays to Broadway and who was then running the National Playwrights
Conference, the prestigious summer workshop at the Eugene O'Neill
Theater in Waterford, Conn. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  At the time, Richards, who had cast Redwood in ``The Piano
Lesson,'' knew him only as a ``very solid actor.'' But after
thumbing through nearly 1,500 manuscripts to select the 15 plays to
be given staged readings that summer, Richards was captivated, he
said, by the authentic, lyrical language of the characters in ``The
Old Settler.'' &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (The title, from a pejorative Harlem term for a woman of a
certain age who has never married, is used against Elizabeth by her
rival, Lou Bessie, portrayed by Rosalyn Coleman.)
</P>
<P>
   In the play, young domestics are said to dance their feet sore
at the weekly ``Kitchen Mechanics' Night'' at the Savoy Ballroom,
the one night they can dance free of charge. Quilly loves ``swamp
seeds'' (rice) and ``pot liquor'' (the savory liquid left over
after stewing collard greens and salt pork). And when Elizabeth
rebukes her young suitor (Godfrey L. Simmons Jr.) for buying an
outrageous suit, Quilly snaps at the dumbfounded boarder, ``Ain't
no use you standing looking like Uncle Ben before he started
cooking rice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``John is a writer with a wonderful ear,'' said Richards, who
put on ``The Old Settler'' that summer of 1995 and arranged to have
it produced the next year in Russia as part of an exchange program
with the O'Neill. ``There are rhythms, music to the play, to the
language,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Writing about an earlier production in The New York Times last
year, Peter Marks praised the play's ``heartwarming'' and
``ruefully funny'' story, as it was presented at the McCarter
Theater in Princeton, N.J., in a co-production with the Long Wharf
Theater in New Haven. But he said that the ``tried and true''
formula resulted in a somewhat predictable plot.
</P>
<P>
   Emily Mann, the artistic director at the McCarter, said
theatergoers, both black and white, had responded effusively.
``It's a love story that's so dear and so sweet and so moving,''
Ms. Mann said.
</P>
<P>
   Accustomed to the twists and turns of an unconventional career,
Redwood seems to shrug off both praise and criticism. On the night
of the play's first preview at Primary Stages, he wore blue jeans
and a baseball cap and had a matter-of-fact manner. When asked
whether he was excited to see the New York production finally
coming together, he announced unexpectedly that ``The Old Settler''
was never his best play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that there's anything wrong with it,'' said Redwood, who
stands 6 feet 3 in his blue Converse All-Stars. It's just that ``A
Sunbeam'' is his favorite.
 &UR;  &LR; Nevertheless, he has worked hard to get ``The Old Settler''
produced, ``and produced properly,'' in regional theaters. He
leaves scolding telephone messages for directors who use upbeat
tempos for gospel songs meant to be melancholy. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  When a casting director told him there was no way to get Ms.
Uggams to play the lead role in New York, Redwood took matters into
his own hands.
</P>
<P>
   Describing how she met the playwright at a reading in Manhattan,
Ms. Uggams recalled: ``All of a sudden, I hear this big, deep voice
saying, `I've been looking for you.' I turn around and there's this
man standing there. I hadn't heard of him, but he's going on and on
about this play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says, `I just so happen to have it with me,' and whips it
out of his bag. It seemed so bizarre.''
</P>
<P>
   But she took the manuscript home that night and by 10 o'clock
the next morning was calling Redwood at his home in East Orange,
N.J.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Q. Later this year I will get stock worth approximately $190,000
and I am very uncertain as to my best option on investing this
money. Taxes are a consideration here. I am 43 and my wife is 38
and we have a 3-year-old daughter. My wife and I earn $70,000
combined and are contributing the maximum allowed _ 15 percent _ to
401(k) plans where we currently have $300,000, with half in an
equity index fund and 15 percent each in a small-cap stock index
and a non-US equity fund. We would both like to retire at about age
55, and at the same time to ensure that our daughter has the
opportunity to attend the college of her choice.
</P>
<P>
   D.B., San Diego
</P>
<P>
   A. Since your daughter will reach college age at about the time
you plan to retire, a significant piece of this money might be
tucked aside now to meet those costs.
</P>
<P>
   Since you've held this stock for many years, you might be well
served by giving some of the stock to your daughter. This should
allow her to sell it and pay the taxes at a lower rate than you
would face.
</P>
<P>
   For example, you might give $30,000 worth of the stock to your
wife, which would not be a taxable event. Then you and she could
each begin a program of giving your daughter $10,000 a year for
three years. The net effect would be that after 14 years of this
program, she would accumulate $217,633, presuming that she held on
to the investments (and thus paid no taxes) and achieved average 10
percent annual returns.
</P>
<P>
   That $217,633 might seem like an awful lot of money for college
right now, but if education costs escalate as predicted that amount
will probably be fairly close for a private college in the year
2014.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course still leaves you with $130,000 worth of the
stock.
</P>
<P>
   If you are determined to sell it, you would probably be best
served by spreading the transactions out over the tax years 1998,
1999, 2000, and perhaps later, depending on your overall tax
situation. You would probably find it worth your while to hire a
tax expert to guide you in this. (Now is also a great time to scour
your assets for a potential capital loss, which would be used to
offset some of the gains.)
</P>
<P>
   However the taxes work out, I would view that $130,000 as money
to be used in two ways. First, since the lion's share of your
current savings are in those tax-deferred 401(k) accounts, I would
begin by building tax-free retirement savings, drawing $2,000 a
year from this money to fund Roth IRAs for both yourself and your
wife.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder I would earmark as a pool that you might draw on
during the 4 1/2-year period after you retire and before you can
begin to withdraw from your tax-deferred accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you were to put this money into a balanced fund such as
Vanguard Balanced Index or Fidelity Puritan, withdrawing only the
money to fund the Roth IRAs. After a dozen years, the pool would be
$281,84, presuming average annual returns of 9 percent from your
investment. Those figures don't reflect any money you might have to
withdraw to pay taxes, but the pool still should be more than ample
to get you through that 4 1/2-year gap.
</P>
<P>
   Q. My asset-allocation strategy includes having a modest portion
of my portfolio in domestic small caps. Currently the money is in
the Heartland Value fund, but I'm concerned about its recent
decision to reopen the fund to new investors. According to
Morningstar Mutual Funds, Heartland Value is significantly larger
than any of its small-cap peers. While I don't doubt (fund manager)
Bill Nasgovitz's stock-picking skills, isn't that large size going
to make it difficult to perform well when small caps finally take
off again? Isn't reopening the fund only going to exacerbate the
problem? If I dump the fund, I'm thinking of replacing it with
something in the small-cap blend category, such as Nicholas Limited
Edition or T. Rowe Price Small-Cap Stock.
</P>
<P>
   J.B., Brighton &QL; 
A. I'm with you most of the way. The fairly lame argument Heartland
Value made to Morningstar on the subject is that the managers don't
``see much danger in the near term of the fund growing rapidly,
given the recent market slide.''
</P>
<P>
   But from my point of view, and probably yours, the goal is not
maintaining the assets, but shrinking them. Only one entity _ the
managing company _ is likely to enjoy maintenance or growth of
assets.
</P>
<P>
   The fund already holds a portfolio of 317 issues, more than
double the 148 average for its small-cap value peers. Any
substantial additional growth in assets under management can only
have one of two results _ spreading the portfolio even further, or
forcing it to invest in ever-larger companies.
</P>
<P>
   I've watched the migration of Kaufmann fund, of which I am a
stockholder, from a small-cap growth portfolio to a mid-cap blend,
and watched as the fund performance steadily declined under the
burden of assets, which exceeded $6 billion entering this year.
</P>
<P>
   I can understand the reason for ``growing'' the fund _ after
all, the more assets under management, the more money the managers
can earn. But perhaps growing assets isn't everything. This year,
as Kaufmann's performance has remained subpar, assets have shrunk
by nearly $2 billion. Some growth strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Heartland Value seems to be following a similar track; its great
years came from 1991 to 1995; entering '91 the assets stood at less
than $20 million and it entered '95 with $339 million under
management. The next year it topped $1 billion, and that was its
last year of superior, or even above-average, performance.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the last Morningstar report, dated June 30,
Heartland Value has $1.92 billion under management; apparently
other owners are following your thinking, because assets stood at
$1.55 billion as of the Oct. 8 report from Lipper Analytical
Services Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm not sure I agree with your thinking about moving from
small-cap value to small-cap blend. In every period ranging from
one month to five years, the average for small-cap value funds has
beat that of the small-cap value or growth peers. The only
small-cap blend fund that Morningstar accords above-average grades
to is Fasciano fund (although Lipper puts it in the mid-cap
category). No small-cap growth fund wins above-average grades.
</P>
<P>
   Given the uncertain market, I suggest you stay in the value end
of the small-cap arena.

ENERGY DEPARTMENT'S ELIZABETH MOLER RESIGNS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAVID IVANOVICH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Elizabeth ``Betsy'' Moler, the Energy Department
official who President Clinton twice passed over for the
department's top job in favor of Hispanic nominees, has resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Moler, who has served as deputy Energy secretary since June 1997
and as acting secretary for nearly seven weeks last summer, left
her job Monday after 30 years in the public sector.
</P>
<P>
   Moler gave her colleagues no indications about her future plans.
She could not be reached for immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
   In a computer message to Energy staffers, Moler said her job
there ``has been simultaneously more difficult, and more
interesting, than I could possibly have imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After ten years as a presidential appointee, and almost 30
years as a `fed,' I am ready for a change in my life,'' Moler said,
adding: ``I look forward to more time with my husband and
especially with my children (they're 13 and almost 8) and,
hopefully, a less frantic pace of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Moler, the former head of the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, was widely viewed as a top contender for the Energy
secretary post, a cabinet position, after Hazel O'Leary stepped
down. But Clinton, concerned about the lack of a Hispanic leader in
his cabinet, asked former Transportation Secretary Federico Pena to
take the job.
</P>
<P>
   When Pena announced his plans to leave in April, Moler was again
identified as the heir apparent. But Clinton overlooked Moler again
and appointed Bill Richardson, the former U.S. ambassador to the
United Nations and another Hispanic, to the post.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson issued a prepared statement regarding Moler's
resignation, hailing Moler's ``integrity, determination,
intelligence and strong management skills.'' &QL;

MILITARY PERSONNEL WARNED AGAINST DENOUNCING CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wyo.)  (Eds: See also CLINTON-IMPEACH, CLINTON-JONES) 
(mk) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Responding to a wave of grousing in the nation's
military about President Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky,
military leaders have taken the unusual step of warning officers
and enlisted personnel that they could face punishment for
denouncing the commander-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   There has hardly been a groundswell of public criticism among
the nation's 1.4 million soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines. But
the furor surrounding Kenneth Starr's report to Congress last month
accusing Clinton of impeachable offenses has prompted military
personnel to write a number of public rebukes of the president,
mostly in articles or letters in newspapers and magazines.
</P>
<P>
   The rumblings have raised enough concern at the Pentagon that
military authorities have on at least two occasions in recent weeks
responded by warning that Article 88 of the Uniformed Code of
Military Justice explicitly prohibits officers from speaking
``contemptuous words'' against the president, the secretary of
defense or other civilian leaders of the armed services. Each of
the services has similar rules that apply to enlisted personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The assistant commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. Terrence
Dake, sent an electronic memorandum to all generals in the service
on Oct. 9 urging them to remind Marines of the prohibitions. ``It
is unethical for individuals who wear the uniform of a Marine to
engage in public dialogue on political and legal matters such as
impeachment,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In September, days after Starr's report saturated the news, an
article in the official newspaper at F.E. Warren Air Force Base in
Wyoming delivered a similarly stern reminder. The article, which
officials said the Air Force has since circulated informally to
other bases, warned Air Force personnel that they ``aren't allowed
to discuss the president in the same manner as civilians,'' citing
Article 88.
</P>
<P>
   The wave of public criticisms of Clinton was first reported
Tuesday in the The Los Angeles Times. Dake's memorandum was first
reported in The Washington Times on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the affair has consumed the nation's military
in much the same way it has consumed the nation in general: in
other words, with the same mixture of fascination and revulsion,
derision for Clinton and contempt for the independent prosecutor,
Kenneth Starr, a feeling of outrage and a desire that it would all
just go away.
</P>
<P>
   But within the rigid world of military discipline, the scandal
has a deeper undercurrent, since a series of officers and enlisted
personnel have been punished under the Uniformed Code of Military
Justice for the same behavior Clinton has acknowledged with Ms.
Lewinsky: an extramarital affair with a subordinate in the
workplace.
</P>
<P>
   From the start of his presidency, Clinton has had a strained
relationship with the military, whose members viewed his evasion of
the draft and his policies on matters like gays in the military
with suspicion, if not resentment. Now the scandal that has brought
him to the brink of an impeachment inquiry has revived
long-simmering feelings, held by some in the ranks, that Clinton is
not fit to lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can anyone in the military defend President Clinton?''
Master Sgt. Stephen Kapp, stationed at Misawa Air Base in Japan,
wrote in a letter to the editor of Air Force Times, published on
Sept. 28. He went on to call for Clinton's resignation, saying,
``This president has made a mockery out of our country.''

SPANISH GOVERNMENT SAYS COURTS WILL DECIDE ON PINOCHET  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for 13th graf, inserting first name of prime minister)   By MARLISE SIMONS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Eager to appear neutral on a highly charged issue, the
conservative government of Spain said Tuesday that it would let the
nation's courts decide whether Madrid had the right to ask London
to extradite Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator,
for trial there.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers close to the case said in private the Madrid
government was working hard to have the judiciary rule against
extradition.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Abel Matutes, the first senior official to
speak clearly on the topic since Scotland Yard arrested Pinochet on
Friday, said the government would take no action to block the
extradition process that a Spanish judge has initiated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is waiting for the judicial authorities to
decide definitively if the extradition should proceed'' before it
sends the request to Britain, Matutes told Spanish radio.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, nonetheless, a prosecutor who was representing
Attorney General Jesus Cardenal filed an appeal before the tribunal
dealing with Pinochet. The appeal argued that Spain had no
jurisdiction to try the general for crimes committed outside Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The investigating magistrate Baltasar Garzon, 42, said in
telephone interview Tuesday that he had faced permanent opposition
from government prosecutors since he began in 1996 to investigate
torture and killings by the Argentine and Chilean military rulers
in the '70s and '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, and then in May and September, the attorney general
instructed government prosecutors to oppose his investigations,
Garzon said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he worried about the outcome, the magistrate said:
``I feel at ease. I trust our country's institutions. We are on
solid legal ground. Spain has signed and ratified the relevant
Geneva Conventions, and their language has been incorporated into
our national legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   These Geneva Conventions require signatory countries to
prosecute grave violations of human rights and crimes against
humanity that are committed anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Manuel Garca Castellon, another judge in Madrid who was
conducting a parallel investigation into the disappearance of more
than 4,000 people in the Chilean dictatorship, handed over his
cases to Garzon. Court officials said that was to avoid a
duplication of effort and would simplify working with the British.
</P>
<P>
   Garzon, who had to act in haste when he heard that Pinochet, who
had surgery, was to leave Britain earlier than planned, initially
asked the British police for permission to interrogate the
82-year-old general in connection with the death of only one
political prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday he broadened his arrest order to include the killing
or disappearance of 94 people of several nationalities.
</P>
<P>
   For the prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar, the Spanish trap set
for Pinochet last Friday was all the more embarrassing, because
news of the arrest arrived in the middle of an Ibero-American
conference in Oporto, Portugal. Both the prime minister and the
civilian president of Chile, Eduardo Frei, were on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Frei and other Chilean officials have put strong pressure on
Madrid to undo the case against Pinochet, contending that he had
diplomatic immunity as a Senator for Life, a post he created for
himself before leaving office.
</P>
<P>
   Aznar, when first asked about the extradition, said: ``The
government may or may not receive requests, and it may or may not
study them, depending on whether it receives them or not and
depending on what they are founded on. But, of course, I will say
nothing until I know what the facts are based on.''
</P>
<P>
   A key to whether Garzon can proceed will be a meeting early next
week, when nine of the 12 magistrates of the tribunal are expected
to convene and rule on whether Spain can claim jurisdiction to
weigh Pinochet's human rights record. That step, the government
said, will determine whether the judge in the case has the right to
request extradition.
</P>
<P>
   But the request would still have to pass political hurdles like
an approval by the justice ministry and, possibly, Aznar's Cabinet.
Political experts in Madrid said Matutes' statement would make it
more difficult for the government to ignore rulings that favored
extradition. The experts said the government's strategy therefore
focused on arguments before the National Court.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Europe, socialist politicians have applauded the
move against the former right-wing dictator. France's Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin told reporters on Monday: ``It seems to me a
good thing that this dictator can be brought to justice, even late
in his life.'' The news of the arrest, he said was ``welcome and
just''.
</P>
<P>
   France, however, chose to pass on the opportunity to have the
Chilean arrested on French soil. Before turning to a London clinic,
Pinochet had apparently planned to have his surgery done in France,
but the French foreign ministry refused his visa request. According
to French diplomats, France had private indications that judge
Garzon was planning to file an extradition request and Paris
preferred to avoid being caught up in the case.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, which played a pivotal role in Pinochet's coup in
1973, State Department officials said the United States was not
involved in the controversy. ``It's a legal matter among the
governments of the U.K., Spain and Chile,'' a State Department
official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``The United States
is not involved.''

GLOBAL DOWNTURN WIDENS U.S. TRADE DEFICIT TO RECORD $17 BILLION

 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Commerce Department on Tuesday provided a
concrete measure of the effects of the global economic downturn on
the American economy, reporting that the nation's trade deficit
widened by $2.2 billion in August to a record $16.77 billion.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, the trade deficit is running roughly 50
percent above last year's levels, a gap that is expected to widen
even further. One senior administration official who insisted on
anonymity said Tuesday that internal projections suggest that the
trade deficit in 1999 could reach $300 billion, up from a projected
$170 billion this year, a figure that he said ``will certainly cut
into growth, and could well become a major political problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Trade deficits carry with them both good and worrisome signals
about the economy. The current flood of imports is helping contain
inflation to some of the lowest levels in decades. And while sales
of American aircraft, computer chips and other goods are suffering,
the surprise weakening of the dollar on world markets in recent
weeks may provide an end-of-the-year boost for American exporters.
</P>
<P>
   But at this moment of global upheaval, the biggest problem
facing American companies is the inability of many nations and some
large companies in Asia and Latin America simply to borrow money to
make ordinary purchases. The result is such a freeze of economic
activity that empty shipping containers are stacking up on American
piers. And the effects are hurting everyone from Midwest farmers
who can no longer send wheat to an impoverished Russia, to East
Coast fishermen who are discovering that Japan's appetite for
salmon and lobster has been ruined by the banking crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most surprising elements of Tuesday's report is that
more than a third of August's deficit was with one country that so
far has managed to ward off the worst effects of the global
troubles: China. Despite continued growth of the Chinese economy,
exports to China have slowed dramatically and imports of
Chinese-made goods have exploded, as the country desperately seeks
to sell here goods that would ordinarily be sold elsewhere in Asia.
That increased the monthly deficit with Beijing to $5.9 billion,
levels previously only seen in trade with Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures come just as the Clinton administration is
complaining that its economic relationship with China has been set
back in the three months since President Clinton's trip there
ended.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese _ besieged by floods, deeply troubled state-owned
industries and an incipient banking crisis _ have signaled to the
United States in recent weeks that they have little interest in any
swift moves to open their markets further in return for entry into
the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   That amounts to a major setback for President Clinton, who for
three years has been using the negotiations over China's entry to
the world body as the centerpiece of his effort to open China both
economically and politically. Ostensible progress in this area has
been cited by the administration until recently as one of the
successes of the administration's China policy, but now officials
say privately that the progress is evaporating.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in exports will trim the growth of the American
economy, and it was one factor in the Federal Reserve's decision to
lower interest rates two times in recent weeks. So administration
officials were going out of their way Tuesday to portray the
numbers as another warning sign, but not a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the United States remains strong and sound, the troubled
condition of the global marketplace continue to strongly influence
the U.S. trade balance,'' Commerce Secretary Williams Daley said in
a statement Tuesday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After China, the biggest deterioration in the American trade
balance in August came in Mexico, where the peso has weakened
markedly as economic contagion has spread through Latin America.
Exports to Mexico have remained unchanged. But imports from Mexico
have increased markedly _ chiefly automobiles and automotive parts
and telecommunications equipment _ as American manufacturers have
taken advantage of the weakening currency.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, America's trade surplus with Brazil, the latest
focus of concern by the administration and the International
Monetary Fund, barely budged from the same period a year ago.
Normally, that would be touted as a victory at a time of great
instability. But the news comes just as the United States and the
IMF are putting the final details on a bailout package of $30
billion or more for Brazil, intended to help it stave off the kind
of economic troubles that have swept through Asia, Russia and
several other nations. Tuesday the IMF and Brazil reached an
agreement on the country's fiscal targets for this year and next, a
sign that the international aid will likely be announced after
elections in Brazil this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But for all these potential problems, the rising trade deficit
has barely caused a ripple on Capitol Hill. Because the rising
level of imports does not appear to be triggering any unemployment
here, the subject has barely come up in races for the House and
Senate around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The only exception has been in areas where the steel industry is
strong: The major steel companies have come here in force in recent
weeks, charging that Asian nations are dumping their products on
the American market at prices well below their production costs.
The Commerce Department has initiated an investigation, but dumping
cases always take time to wend their way through the Washington
bureaucracy, and steel makers have insisted that the job security
of their workers is immediately in peril.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department's numbers showed that the deficit rose
15.3 percent to $16.77 billion in August, up from a revised figure
of $14.55 billion in July. The department said that the resumption
of production at General Motors Corp. after last summer's strike
may have increased the size of the deficit's rise in August, as GM
brought in parts from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The deficit was the highest since the Commerce Department began
a new method of tracking trade information in 1992. Exports, the
department said, fell three tenths of 1 percent, to about $74.8
billion. Imports rose 2.2 percent to $91.6 billion.

COMMENTARY: REALITY BITES HOLLYWOOD  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK RICH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At last there's a liar we can all root for.
</P>
<P>
   Her name is Riley Weston _ though she was born Kimberlee Kramer
_ and last week she was pilloried in the fiercely moral town of
Hollywood, where she is a TV actress and writer. Her crime: having
gulled her producers, agents and lawyers into believing she was 19
when in fact she turns out to be an old lady of 32.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Weston, who has the acting ability and looks to play a
teen-ager, had pulled her ruse to land a role most recently on
``Felicity,'' the heavily promoted would-be ``Ally McBeal'' of the
new season, and then to get writing assignments for it and other TV
projects. Now she twists in the wind. Touchstone, the Disney
division that lately signed her to a $300,000 writing contract, is
considering dumping Ms. Weston _ surely not because she's suddenly
lost her writing talent. Her real sin may have been to make TV
executives look like fools who, as Newsweek put it, ``wouldn't know
a real teen-ager if one walked in the door.''
</P>
<P>
   When I spoke to Ms. Weston this week, she said she ``felt
terrible'' about hurting the feelings of those she duped. But she
added unapologetically: ``I lied to get an acting job _ to get my
foot in the door. That's it.'' As she reached her late 20s _ she
has been acting on network TV for almost a decade _ she found that
casting agents wouldn't even allow her to audition for teen-age
roles she knew she could play. So she changed her name, dropped old
credits from her resume and reinvented herself, like actors of both
sexes since the dawn of show biz. Also like her predecessors, she
found that shrewd self-marketing ignited the hype of show-biz
journalism: Entertainment Weekly, more correctly than it may have
foreseen, put her on this summer's ``It List'' of the 100 most
creative people in entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, is Ms. Weston vilified for an age-old ``crime''? One
producer says she is resented for having successfully dropped so
many years from her age, rather than the standard few. But her real
offense may be to have focused attention, however inadvertently, on
the accelerating pathology of Hollywood's perennial worship of
youth, especially female youth _ and its fallout into the culture
imbibed by us all.
</P>
<P>
   It is pandering to teen-agers and the barely adult, the holiest
demographic, that has led to phenomena like Fox's ``Miniskirt
Monday,'' so breathlessly promoted during the World Series over the
weekend. And that has increasingly led studios to match male stars
nearing or over 60, from Harrison Ford to Warren Beatty, with
nearly intern-age love interests from Anne Heche to Halle Berry, in
every romance-minded movie. ``By their early 30s women are passe,
unless they're Meryl Streep,'' says one woman producer. Or as a
line famously had it in ``The First Wives Club,'' there are only
three ages for women in Hollywood _ ``babe, district attorney and
`Driving Miss Daisy.'''
</P>
<P>
   That this obsession would affect not just on-camera Hollywood
players but those off-camera is the unsavory recent evolution
dragged into the light by Ms. Weston's hoax. Though it's hard to
imagine a producer insisting that only elderly writers write
elderly characters or only black writers write blacks, Ms. Weston
discovered that casting-couch youthfulness, not just her talent,
could bring her writing as well as acting gigs on ``young''
projects. Were she 32, she might not get a meeting with middle-aged
TV executives panting for the next hot young voice.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Gelbart _ co-author of ``Tootsie,'' the movie about an
actor who makes himself into a woman to land a TV role _ knows
colleagues who won't list their credits from his classic series
``M.A.S.H.'' on their resumes ``because it dates them'' in an
industry where ``inexperience is a prized asset.'' He finds the
hypocritical self-righteousness attending Ms. Weston's case
laughable. ``Everyone here lies about everything,'' he says. ``They
have their faces changed. They have their photos airbrushed. They
lie about their last salaries. They're probably being interviewed
by somebody who just lost a Pulitzer Prize because of lying.'' He
wonders if Ms. Weston ``is dying for all our lies.''
</P>
<P>
   That remains to be seen. In the meantime, you can see her last
performance as a teen-ager on the Nov. 17 ``Felicity.'' After that,
she'll suffer what in Hollywood is a fate worse than death _ middle
age.

A BAND AFTER HAYDN'S OWN HEART  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 25) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Symphony conductors are forever exhorting their
troops to play like chamber musicians: to achieve immediate,
intimate and constant communication by listening intently to one
another and learning to react symbiotically.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few of the best ensembles, notably the Vienna
Philharmonic and the Cleveland Orchestra, seem to have assimilated
this style of performance as second nature through long decades of
good, hard work.
</P>
<P>
   For at least one band, however, far more modest in its scale and
history to be sure, that sort of communication has never been a
problem. The Orchestra of St. Luke's was born as an outgrowth of
the St. Luke's Chamber Ensemble, whose 21 players still form its
core. A chamber style of performance is first nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pay attention to each other when when we're playing,
sometimes more than we pay attention to the conductor,'' said
Stephen Taylor, an oboist and an original member of the chamber
ensemble. ``That's a defining character of the orchestra.''
</P>
<P>
   However it may relate to conductors, and most who have worked
with it offer only praise, the organization, now cumbersomely
called Orchestra of St. Luke's/St. Luke's Chamber Ensemble, has
enjoyed a consistent run of successes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, it began a residency at the Caramoor Festival in
Katonah, N.Y., which resulted in the founding of the orchestra and
helped put both institutions on the map. In 1985, it took part in
high-profile series of Bach and Handel choral performances led by
John Nelson at Carnegie Hall. In 1986, a night after the glittery,
unmemorable opening of the newly renovated Carnegie Hall, the
orchestra wowed a listener in its own right for the first time,
with a riveting performance of Beethoven's ``Eroica'' Symphony,
among other things, led by Michael Tilson Thomas. In 1990, it
established a permanent relationship with the conductor Robert
Shaw, as part of his annual choral workshop at Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is not without problems of its own. Shuttling between the
worlds of orchestral and chamber performance, and heavily invested
in education as well, it presents to the world a certain vagueness
of image, identity and purpose. Until it named Charles Mac-kerras
music director, recently, it had had only one other: Roger
Norrington, from 1991 to 1994. It has no permanent hall.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its own concerts, it works for hire in a variety
of settings. Even the name has become a red herring, since the many
locations in which the organization performs rarely include the
Church of St. Luke in the Fields, in Greenwich Village, where it
gave its first chamber concerts, in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that it befuddles people on the outside,'' said Myron
Lutkze, a cellist and stalwart of the group, ``but we love all the
things we do.''
</P>
<P>
   This season the organization is trying to address the world's
befuddlement and bring its image into sharper focus through the odd
expedient of attaching itself to another name: Haydn. The chamber
ensemble plays the composer's Symphonies Nos. 6, 7 and 8
(``Morning,'' ``Noon'' and ``Night''), conductorless, Sunday
afternoon at the Brooklyn Museum of Art and on Wednesday evening at
Weill Recital Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra plays a program of Haydn conducted by Frans
Bruggen on Thursday evening at Carnegie Hall. And apart from
special series and concerts for hire, for the rest of the season _
two more orchestral concerts, two more chamber programs, a choral
concert, a puppet opera, even musically accompanied dinners at
Lutece _ it's Haydn all the way.
</P>
<P>
   In itself, a preoccupation with Haydn's music is nothing new for
St. Luke's. ``Haydn was central to the conception,'' said Michael
Feldman, who created the ensemble in 1974, partly as an outlet for
his conducting ambitions, and left it in 1995. Versatility was also
a goal, and it may have become the orchestra's hallmark.
</P>
<P>
   But in a repertory that has ranged freely from Bach to newly
commissioned works, Haydn has always held his own. The orchestra
recorded three CDs of his symphonies with Mackerras from 1988 to
1992 for Telarc.
</P>
<P>
   Now, again, the identification with Haydn is pervasive: a sense
that the multifarious activities of St. Luke's, as they have
evolved, reflect the composer's own activities and the flexible
resources available to him during his Hungarian employment, from
1761 to 1790.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mix of orchestra and chamber music is reminiscent of
Haydn's situation at the Esterhazy court,'' said Elizabeth Ostrow,
who, as director of artistic planning for St. Luke's since 1996,
conceived the Haydn festival.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, the orchestra and ensemble perform 75 to 100
concerts a year. They also offer 25 performances of free opera and
dance a year, reaching about 25,000 students in New York schools.
</P>
<P>
   The players, typically some 55 strong in the full orchestra,
represent the cream of the extraordinary pool of freelance
musicians in New York. Because it invariably plays with a vigor
evident to eye as well as ear, the orchestra gives an impression of
youth that may no longer be entirely accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Turnover is small. Krista Bennion Feeney, a violinist and
frequent concertmistress who joined the group in 1983, calls
herself ``a relative newcomer.''
</P>
<P>
   Morale appears to be high not only for musical reasons but also
because, to an extent rare in American orchestras, the players take
a hand in governing themselves. For all, it is a part-time
situation. A member of the elite chamber ensemble, and thus a
principal player in the orchestra, might make from $8,000 a year
(for a brass player seldom used) to $40,000 (for a string player in
constant demand). Most have many commitments elsewhere but
typically refer to St. Luke's as a family.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like coming home,'' said Ms. Feeney. Eriko Sato, another
violinist, whose effervescent spirit seems to infect other players
and audience alike, said: ``It's more than that. It's an
inspiration. There's such commitment and respect for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the orchestra's sound, Ms. Sato cited a tradition of a
strong bass line, owing much to Lutzke, the cellist. ``It's an
unspoken rule,'' she said. ``The bass line determines the rhythm,
and this orchestra has fantastic rhythm, I think.'' She is not
alone in thinking so, and she may underestimate her own role in
producing it.
</P>
<P>
   The players themselves were the instigators of the refocusing of
recent years. The feeling was evidently widespread that the
orchestra had strayed somewhat from the Haydn ideal as it grew.
</P>
<P>
   When the founder, Feldman, ever ambitious, pushed for the
performance of large-scale works like symphonies by Bruckner and
Mahler in the orchestra's own concerts, or for the use of period
instruments in early music, he met with resistance from the
players.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when it plays for hire, the orchestra can easily expand
as needed, if, for example, Shaw mobilizes a Verdi Requiem. What's
more, many St. Luke's members play period instruments on other
gigs, but crucial wind players do not, and a sense of solidarity
prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``For right or wrong, period is where it's at in early music
today,'' Feldman said. ``I encouraged St. Luke's to work with
period instruments, too, but I couldn't get them to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Feldman, who left St. Luke's three years ago in cloudy
circumstances that those in the know declined to discuss, is now
forming the New York Collegium, a period orchestra and chorus to be
directed by the venerable early-music specialist Gustav Leonhardt,
which recently opened an office in Manhattan and plans to give its
first concert in January.
</P>
<P>
   And Feldman is already talking about developing a period
orchestra of Romantic proportions to play Wagner and the like in
perhaps three years.
</P>
<P>
   But both he and Marianne C. Lockwood, who is the executive
director of St. Luke's and his ex-wife, say they anticipate an
amicable rather than competitive relationship. Indeed, the
collegium roster includes several veteran St. Luke's hands, like
the ubiquitous Lutzke.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying very hard not to get in each other's way,'' Ms.
Lockwood said.
</P>
<P>
   St. Luke's would seem to have a hard enough time not tripping
over itself, as it keeps its many balls in the air. For beyond
Haydn, starting in February, the chamber ensemble presents its
``Second Helpings'' series of contemporary music at the Dia Center
for the Arts in Chelsea, with Eric Ewazen as composer in residence
and host.
</P>
<P>
   (Next season, it was just announced, Joan Tower will take over
and compose a work celebrating the 25th anniversary of St. Luke's.)
And in May, it offers ``Masters of the Baroque,'' a free festival
at Temple Emanu-El, on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time we tried to find a permanent home,'' Ms.
Lockwood said. ``But we've changed our minds. We feel that we've
made a home for ourselves all over New York in a variety of
different communities.''
</P>
<P>
   As unconventional as it may be in its operations, St. Luke's has
had its ups and downs, and it is not immune from the difficulties
now facing larger orchestras, financial and otherwise. Despite
surpluses in recent years, the organization retains an accumulated
deficit of $240,000 on an annual budget just under $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   And the orchestra's extensive recording projects, including a
major Stravinsky venture conducted by Robert Craft on Musicmasters,
have been forestalled. Both problems, Ms. Lockwood said, are being
addressed by a fund-raising campaign intended not only to erase the
deficit and create a permanent endowment but also to provide
subsidies for recordings.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Arabesque is recording at least some of the chamber
ensemble's Haydn programs. And St. Luke's is looking for other ways
to raise its profile outside New York. It is formulating plans for
the first of a series of mini-residencies, a stint of perhaps five
days next season at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., including
master classes as well as chamber, orchestral and educational
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are as healthy as we could expect to be,'' Ms. Lockwood
said. Certainly, when it comes to the sound of things, few seem
inclined to argue.

MICROSOFT DEFENDS ITS TACTICS AS GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEVE LOHR and JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Stinging from the government's opening statement, a
defiant Microsoft Corp. forcefully defended its chairman, Bill
Gates, in federal court on Tuesday, asserting that the
no-holds-barred tactics of his company are not only common in the
computer industry but also good for economy.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's opening salvo in the sweeping antitrust suit was
crafted as much for public opinion as for the court. The company
faces weeks of being portrayed as an alleged commercial predator in
a highly publicized trial, which could badly tarnish Microsoft's
reputation even if it wins.
</P>
<P>
   The government's case, which opened on Monday in the U.S.
District Court here, amounts to a litany of episodes of Microsoft's
having used its market power to bully and bend competitors,
business partners and corporate customers to its will.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Microsoft's legal team sought to frame these
episodes as part of rough-and-tumble capitalism. While the way
Microsoft does business may not be to everyone's liking, they
suggested, it is certainly not illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The antitrust laws are not a code of civility in business,''
said John Warden, Microsoft's lead lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In his two-hour opening statement, Warden angrily accused the
government of trying to ``demonize Bill Gates,'' whom he described
as ``a man whose vision and innovation have been at the core of the
benefits that society is reaping from the information age.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 20 states suing Microsoft, Warden
said, are misinterpreting routine business meetings in the computer
industry as anticompetitive conspiracies. The government's case
focuses largely on the Internet software market and the business
practices Microsoft used in its fight against the Netscape
Communications Corp., the early leader in the browser software used
to navigate the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   A key charge in the suit, for example, is that Microsoft prodded
Netscape to illegally divide up the browser market in a June 1995
meeting _ a charge based mainly on the accounts of Netscape
executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Netscape's account of this meeting was fantastical,'' Warden
said. ``None of the histrionics, shouting and table pounding
occurred. It's fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   In Microsoft's view, the government's case is wrongheaded
because it does not understand the computer industry, especially
the necessity of cooperation among companies so that sophisticated
technology products work with each other. Just as the line between
one software product and another often blurs, the company argues,
so does the line between competition and cooperation; rivals in one
area routinely cooperate in another.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft will attempt to cast doubt on several of the
government's allegations by characterizing meetings as efforts at
cooperation by companies that, understandably, do not always agree.
</P>
<P>
   The government, for example, has alleged that Microsoft tried to
pressure both the Intel Corp. and Apple Computer Inc. to back off
Internet software efforts than conflicted with Microsoft's plans _
and to support Microsoft in the browser war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those proposals and threats claimed by the government,''
Warden said, ``will be shown by evidence to have been
garden-variety commercial discussions between companies developing
complementary products. They are of no antitrust consequence.''
</P>
<P>
   As the defendant, Microsoft does not have to prove that it
behaved innocently or even ethically. Instead, the role of
Microsoft's legal team is to cast considerable doubt on the
government's case _ both its specific allegations of bullying
tactics and its broad theme that the economy and consumers are
ultimately harmed by Microsoft's behavior.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon court session, the Microsoft defense moved to
the cross-examination of the government's lead-off witness, James
Barksdale, the president and chief executive of Netscape. To speed
up the trial, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has ordered that direct
testimony from witnesses for both sides must be submitted in
writing beforehand. So all the courtroom questioning of witnesses
begins with cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   With Barksdale on the stand, Microsoft's legal tactics soon
became apparent. Warden, a detailed, methodical interrogator,
sought to portray Netscape as a Microsoft rival that went running
to the Justice Department as a business tactic.
</P>
<P>
   His questions also tried to lead Barksdale into admitting that
all software makers are constantly adding new features to their
products and that many companies have large shares of their markets
without being branded a monopolist _ central themes of Microsoft's
defense.
</P>
<P>
   A lean, craggy 55-year-old executive who speaks with the accent
of his native Louisiana, Barksdale proved an elusive and often
entertaining witness. Warden asked Barksdale about the early years
of his career when he worked as a salesman for the IBM Corp. from
1965 to 1972, years when IBM faced the kind of antitrust scrutiny
Microsoft faces today.
</P>
<P>
   Warden asked Barksdale if he believed the then-dominant IBM was
a monopolist. ``I don't know if I believed it,'' Barksdale replied,
``but we were trained to behave as if we were a monopoly because we
were operating under a consent decree,'' as Microsoft is today.
</P>
<P>
   Warden then asked Barksdale if he did not believe that the
dominant product of that day _ the IBM mainframe computer _ was not
a so-called bundled product of hardware and software that customers
had to buy together.
</P>
<P>
   The question relates to the current case because the government
alleges that Microsoft's Windows operating system and its Internet
Explorer browser are in fact two products bundled together for the
purpose of forcing customers who want its industry-standard
operating system to also take its browser. Microsoft says the
browser is a feature of its Windows operating system, and thus a
single product.
</P>
<P>
   To the mainframe question, Barksdale replied that IBM mainframe
hardware and software was sold as a bundle but that a 1968 consent
decree forced IBM to also sell them separately _ very similar to
the unbundling remedy that the government is seeking in the current
Microsoft case.
</P>
<P>
   ``That forced unbundling gave rise to a whole new industry of
hardware companies like Amdahl that made mainframe machines that
run IBM mainframe software,'' Barksdale said.
</P>
<P>
   To try to show that Netscape viewed a government suit as a
competitive tactic, Warden repeatedly questioned Barksdale about
his meetings with Justice Department officials including Joel
Klein, the assistant attorney general in charge of the antitrust
division.
</P>
<P>
   Warden produced a document for presentation at a Netscape
strategy meeting, titled the ``Project Rocket Launch Plan.'' At the
meeting, held early this year, one of four items under the heading
``The Situation'' was ``DOJ and court actions create opportunity
for Netscape.''
</P>
<P>
   Warden then asked Barksdale whether he viewed a Justice
Department suit as a ``key'' opportunity for his company. Not a key
one perhaps, Barksdale replied, but he did view a government
antitrust suit against Microsoft as ``a way of protecting an
opportunity to keep the playing field open for Internet software.''

PROTESTS SHOW IMPACT OF SHEPARD KILLING ON GAY COMMUNITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wyo., Colo., N.C., Texas, Calif.)  (Eds: See also NY-GAY-RALLY) 
(mk) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For some of the younger marchers, the demonstration
Monday night that paralyzed parts of midtown Manhattan was their
first political rally. For some older protesters, though, the march
_ to express outrage over the killing of a gay college student in
Wyoming _ was a return to the angry street protests that had so
often symbolized the militancy of the gay rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   As the chaotic denouement of the march and the police response
was debated Tuesday, one thing seemed clear: The size of the
loosely organized protest showed how the killing of Matthew Shepard
has galvanized gay men and lesbians in New York and around the
country as has no other single event in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration began at 6 p.m. as a rally in front of the
Plaza Hotel on 59th Street near Central Park, then swelled to 5,000
people on Fifth Avenue, blocking traffic. Confrontations with
police officers resulted in 120 arrests.
</P>
<P>
   While the size of the protest in midtown surprised even its
organizers, the evocation of anger and sadness on the streets of
New York was hardly unique. Candlelight vigils have taken place
across the country, from Washington to Grand Junction, Colo.,
Raleigh, N.C., and Lubbock, Texas. In San Francisco, the giant
rainbow flag in the Castro district that symbolizes the gay rights
movement was lowered to half staff.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has been filled with discussion of the crime,
students have rallied on college campuses, vigils have been held at
churches.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the passion, participants say, is a sense that even
as gay people have become more accepted in society than ever
before, there are stark reminders of the hatred and violence of the
not-so distant past. Well before Shepard's murder, a sharp increase
in police reports of anti-gay bias crimes in New York City had
unsettled gay people, shaking them out of what some call
complacency in the years since the height of AIDS activism.
</P>
<P>
   Recent protests over issues like benefits for domestic partners
and the right to march in the St. Patrick's Day Parade have lacked
the drama of the guerrilla street tactics of AIDS activists. Some
gay men and lesbians contend that their success in drawing
attention to AIDS gave some a false feeling of security and
acceptance, especially in the city with the largest gay population
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a sense, I think, in the gay community, particularly
living in a certain segment of it in New York City, that we can
live in a kind of bubble and feel relatively safe and feel as if
we've arrived,'' said Tim Allis, 37, a magazine editor. ``A sense
that gay rights are there, that we are so much a part of the
mainstream in so many ways, so visible, with so many role models on
television. It's a bit of an illusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Ruble, 45, had been to two gay pride rallies and parades,
but never to a large protest march until Monday night. ``Sometimes,
in our little gay lives in the middle of America, I think we have
forgotten that they kill us,'' he said. ``They hate us.''
</P>
<P>
   In more than 20 interviews with gay men and lesbians in the past
week, many people said that the killing of Matthew Shepard had
struck a strong emotional chord. Some cited his clean-cut image.
Others spoke of the brutality of the crime, in which he was left,
severely beaten, lashed to a fence in near-freezing temperatures to
die.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Blotcher, who was a spokesman for Queer Nation, a street
protest group, in the early 1990s, said that in recent years, his
group and other militant organizations had run out of steam and
were failing to attract young members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking to younger people to pick up the mantle and it
wasn't really happening,'' he said. ``I attributed that to that
fact that a new generation came of age and said: `I don't have to
be a gay activist, I'm just a gay person. It doesn't have to be an
issue.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think something like this reminds us that it still is an
issue,'' he added. ``There were lots of young people at the rally
on Fifth Avenue. And there were people I know there who had hung up
their activist mantles and gone into semiretirements.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, there were 82 anti-gay bias crimes reported
this year through Oct. 4, compared with 46 during the same period
last year, representing a 78 percent jump, said Deputy Inspector
Barbara Sicilia, commander of the Bias Unit. Overall bias crimes
rose by 2 percent, to 384 from 374.
</P>
<P>
   Although the most incidents were reported in lower Manhattan,
where they usually occur, more incidents were also reported in the
boroughs of Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Locke, director of client services at the Gay and Lesbian
Anti-Violence Project, a nonprofit organization that helps victims
of bias crimes, said the spread of bias crimes across the city
shows the extent to which gay people are becoming more visible
outside their usual neighborhoods, Greenwich Village and Chelsea in
Manhattan and Park Slope in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most gay-related crimes have people come to your neighborhood
and seek you out to hurt you,'' he said. ``Now people don't have to
come downtown. As we are more visible outside of Manhattan, we have
also seen an increase in crimes in those neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   While many activists believe that anti-gay crimes are on the
rise across the country, statistics are difficult to come by. The
National Coalition of Anti-Violence Projects, which collects data
from 14 organizations across the country, reported that violent
crimes against gay people rose 2 percent, to 2,445 incidents, in
1997, the last year for which statistics are available. In 1996,
the report said, anti-gay crimes rose by 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But those figures reflect incidents labeled bias crimes by local
organizations, which often use different standards from police when
determining motivation. Jack Levin, a professor of sociology and
criminology at Northeastern University in Boston and an author of
``Hate Crimes: The Rising Tide of Bigotry and Bloodshed'' (Plenum
Press, 1993), said it was not unusual for anti-gay crimes to buck
the trends of other bias crimes.

   ``Most hate crimes respond to economic factors like the
unemployment rate, but not gay-bashing,'' he said. ``Gay-bashing
has nothing to do with money, with economic survival. That's why so
many perpetrators are teen-agers and come from every point among
the economic continuum. It is typically done by young people, with
their hormones raging, feeling confusion about sexual identity.
Young guys in denial about their own homosexual feelings who see
the very presence of a gay person as a threat.''
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration Monday night was billed as a ``political
funeral'' for Shepard. But organizers also saw it as an opportunity
to protest the rise in anti-gay crimes in New York City and to call
on the state Senate to pass an anti-bias law for gay people.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen states, including New York, do not have legislation
that specifically prohibits anti-gay hate crimes. In these states,
someone who assaults a gay man or a lesbian can be convicted of
assault, but not a bias-related assault. New York does have a law,
aggravated harassment in the first degree, that outlaws harassing
people because of ``the race, color, religion or national origin of
such person,'' but it makes no reference to sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Allis, the magazine editor, said that Shepard's killing put
recent history into a new light.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was that sense of connecting the dots,'' he said.
``Between the well-publicized murders, the less-publicized hate
crimes that we hear about across the country, Trent Lott's words
calling homosexuality a disease, and small acts of intolerance,
there were all sorts of indications. But the murder of Matthew
Shepard brought the picture into relief.''

CONGRESS VOTES 333-95 IN FAVOR OF 1999 BUDGET AGREEMENT WITH
CLINTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Nov. 3 elections looming, Congress turned a
vote on the final 1999 budget agreement with President Clinton into
a giant campaign advertisement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In floor speeches and staged events, Democrats and Republicans
spent the day bad-mouthing one another and claiming credit for
various aspects of the budget deal as they tried to maneuver into
the best political position going into the final two weeks of the
congressional campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The debate ended with an overwhelming vote of 333-95 in favor of
the massive spending measure after a rousing speech from House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., who called the bill a ``win-win'' for
Democrats and Republicans and a bipartisan ``team effort for the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We in fact produced a win-win bill. Yes, our liberal friends
get a few things, and in a free society where you are sharing power
between the legislative and executive branch that is precisely the
outcome you should get,'' Gingrich told disgruntled conservative
colleagues before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good bill. It deserves a yes vote by every member
and it is in fact precisely how the American system operates,''
Gingrich said to heavy applause.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate put off a vote on the measure until Wednesday. But it
was expected to pass with overwhelming support. White House
officials said Clinton would sign it.
</P>
<P>
   The last in a series of temporary funding measures that has kept
the government running since the start of the new fiscal year on
Oct. 1 expires at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 30 members of the Texas delegation, Rep. Lloyd
Doggett, D-Austin, was the only Democrat to vote against the
measure. Also voting no were four Republicans; Kevin Brady of The
Woodlands, Joe Barton of Ennis, Sam Johnson of Plano, and Ron Paul
of Surfside.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's comments on the art of compromise came at the end of
long day of pure politics in the halls of Congress with Republicans
and Democrats jockeying for the upper hand in the election-year
public relations war.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats blasted away at Republican leaders for failing to
move any major legislation this year and for hammering together
``this monstrosity'' of an appropriations bill, as one senator
described it, that ran more than 4,000 pages and that no lawmaker
had time to read.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I know what's in the bill? Are you kidding? Only God knows
what's in this conference report,'' Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W. Va.,
said during a debate on the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, meanwhile, moved to claim credit for increasing
defense spending and adding $1.2 billion for hiring new public
school teachers, although they were opposed to more education money
until Clinton threatened a veto.
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of complaints from conservatives about the
single document that rolls eight appropriations bills worth nearly
$600 billion into one giant spending package. Many of the
complaints centered on the fact that it was hastily pulled together
in negotiations last week between the Republican leadership and the
president without members having a chance to fully consider
everything in it.
</P>
<P>
   When the bill was finally printed and delivered to congressional
offices Monday night, it stood nearly two feet tall and weighed
about 45 pounds, according to a Democratic aide who placed it on a
bathroom scale to see, he said, ``how much pork it's got in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Republicans and Democrats made sure it had a lot. In
addition to the big-ticket items to fund 10 Cabinet departments ,
the bill was filled with hundreds of smaller local spending
projects and special interest benefits designed in many instances
to help incumbents look good back home in an election year.
</P>
<P>
   In summing up why members should support it, Rep. Bob
Livingston, R-La., chairman of the Appropriations Committee,
described the bill as a compromise measure with a little something
for everybody that would be good for the country. He encouraged his
GOP colleagues to use it in their campaigns even though it might
contain elements they disagree with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to vote for this bill, and go home to our
districts and explain why we should come back as the majority in
the 106th Congress,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Democratic leaders encouraged their rank and file to
support it, mainly because of the extra education funding. But
while encouraging their colleagues to vote for it, they called it,
as Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., put it, ``a god-awful mess,'' that
should never have been brought to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill is symbol of wasted time and misguided priorities of
the Republican Congress,'' said House Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt, D-Mo., who blasted away at the Republicans for spending
too much time ``on investigations (of Clinton and the Democrats)
instead of legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Some conservative Republicans agreed with that assessment and
criticized their leaders for reaching an agreement with Clinton
that includes nearly $20 billion in emergency spending for
GOP-backed defense programs, peacekeeping forces in Bosnia and farm
aid that will have to be paid for from projected surpluses. The
disgruntled Republicans said it would jeopardize some of the
anticipated revenues this year and next that have been earmarked
for shoring up Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about using $20 billion out of the government
surplus for new spending. This idea of using Social Security money
is not right,'' said Rep. Mark Neumann, R-Wis., who is running for
the Senate this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sham. It's an embarrassment and we should vote no on
this ugly bill,'' echoed Rep. Jon Christensen, R-Neb.
</P>
<P>
   The revolt by GOP conservatives, most of them new to the
Congress, brought an angry Gingrich to the floor, where he accused
them of being ``perfectionists'' unschooled in the art of
legislative compromise necessary to the survival of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't pass a bill ... you can't get anything done,''
Gingrich shouted. ``In a free society you have to have give and
take.'' &QL;

 NO SCANDAL, LITTLE INTEREST MARKS R.I.'s GUBERNATORIAL RACE  
(nk) 
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ The somewhat wistful word on the street here
is that this year's governor's race is a bore, a plodding match
between two candidates who are so decent and civil that they cannot
summon the almost mandatory vitriol that has traditionally made
Rhode Island politics a full-contact sport. Heck, people say, there
isn't even a good scandal brewing.
</P>
<P>
   The race between the incumbent Republican, a former U.S.
attorney named Lincoln C. Almond, and the Democratic challenger, a
former state senator named Myrth York, is close enough for both to
have summoned help from outside. Tuesday, New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani stumped for Almond in the Italian-American
communities in and around Providence, while Hillary Rodham Clinton
stopped by to praise Ms. York at four events.
</P>
<P>
   And those who complain about a narcolepsy-inducing campaign
might just be spoiled, for autumn has once again brought touches of
the bizarre. Forget that a third-party candidate for governor,
Robert Healey, running on the Cool Moose ticket, countered the
visits of Giuliani and Mrs. Clinton with a celebrity of his own:
Barney the dinosaur. Forget that the state senate majority leader
recently pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge that he hit his
wife, or that the recently deposed Democratic state chairman was
just arrested, at gunpoint, on a charge that he assaulted his
girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, consider the curious courtship of Providence Mayor
Vincent A. ``Buddy'' Cianci Jr., a case study in political
resurrection. After taking a lengthy sabbatical from office _
prompted by a 1983 conviction for assaulting his estranged wife's
boyfriend _ he was re-elected in 1990, again in 1994, and now is
running unopposed for his sixth term.
</P>
<P>
   The campaigns for both the Republican and Democratic candidates
for governor have asked for Cianci's endorsement, an otherwise
routine request if it were not for the ever-lurking past. Ms. York
is best known as a reform-style politician, a niche not normally
associated with Cianci. Almond spent years leading a federal
investigation into corruption within the earlier manifestations of
the Cianci administration, and succeeded in securing more than a
dozen convictions. The mayor's rough edge, it seems, is now seen as
part of his roguish charm.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Cianci, an independent, came to the Statehouse to
present Giuliani with a key to the city and a jar of marinara sauce
that bears the Cianci surname. While his eyes hunted to make
contact in a crowded room, Cianci acknowledged being honored by the
attention. ``They both called and said they would like the support
of the organization of the city of Providence,'' he said, using a
euphemism for the Cianci organization.
</P>
<P>
   But Cianci dodged questions about his endorsement plans. ``I
always said that I would do the best thing for my city,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to wanting to glory in a city in the midst of
revitalization _ symbolized by the steel skeleton of a mall being
built just down the hill from the Statehouse _ the two
gubernatorial candidates see an endorsement from Cianci as one way
to counter voter apathy, which political consultants attribute to
the cautious campaigns being conducted by the two moderates and to
the paucity of scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a state where politics has always been a great
spectator sport,'' Darrell M. West, a professor of political
science at Brown University, said. ``But this year voters are
disengaged.''
</P>
<P>
   Several years have passed since outraged citizens gathered on
the Statehouse lawn one night and, with flickering candles in their
hands, prayed for an end to corruption. Although the former
Republican governor, Edward D. DiPrete, is awaiting trial on
charges that his administration in the 1980s was essentially for
sale, the recent news in Rhode Island has largely been positive:
The economy is percolating, the state recently realized a surplus,
and the development in Providence has boosted morale.
</P>
<P>
   All this would seem to benefit Almond, 62, who defeated Ms. York
by a very close margin in 1994. He has taken credit for bringing
back businesses that had fled to the South and for creating 25,000
jobs. At a political rally Tuesday morning, state Republican
Chairman John Holmes added a uniquely Rhode Island accolade: ``And
he's done it scandal-free!''
</P>
<P>
   But recent polls indicate that Ms. York trails by only a few
percentage points, in a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans
2 to 1, and where nearly half the 630,000 registered voters
consider themselves to be independent. And Ms. York, 52, has
focused on the poor standardized testing scores of Rhode Island
students, as well as the state's notoriously bad roads, in courting
a voting bloc that her campaign has christened ``working
families.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, her aides are concerned that Cianci is running unopposed,
meaning that Ms. York might not receive maximum benefit from the
traditional Democratic stronghold that is Providence; they also
acknowledge that a decision by Cianci not to endorse anyone would
constitute a benign endorsement for Almond.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is past the days when anyone even as popular as the mayor
can transfer his support to another candidate,'' her campaign
manager, Rob Horowitz, said. ``But the mayor could be helpful to us
in boosting turnout in Providence.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes agreed. ``These guys were not bosom buddies,'' he said.
``But the governor has always believed that because he's the
governor and Buddy Cianci is the mayor of the largest city, there
needed to be a good working relationship. If he endorses us, it's a
win, and if he doesn't endorse anybody, it's a win.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As the candidates continued to await word from Cianci, they set
out Tuesday _ with celebrity guests in tow _ to cut into each
other's perceived base of support. Ms. York introduced Mrs. Clinton
to 1,000 senior citizens at a stadium in Woonsocket, a city in the
mostly Democratic area of the Blackstone Valley. Almond is a native
son of the valley who carried his home turf in 1994; its residents
know that they are as likely to see him at a local diner as at the
Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Almond escorted Giuliani to places where the governor hoped to
steal the affections of a few Italian-American Democrats. Those
visits began at Luigi's Restaurant in Johnston, and ended at the
Mediterraneo Caffe, on Federal Hill in Providence.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs, Almond and Giuliani shook hands, dodged bouncing
campaign balloons and shouted above the music of an Italian band.
Downstairs, Cianci sat down at a table with some friends. He sipped
a glass of white wine, dragged on a cigarette, and laughed and
laughed.

 By SHARON R. KING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ellen Passe sat in the passenger seat of an RX 300,
the new Lexus midsized sport utility vehicle, while her 2-year-old
son, Alex, fiddled with the steering wheel. Outside the car, her
husband, Michael, spoke with a salesman at a midtown Manhattan
Lexus dealership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are my heated seats?'' Ms. Passe asked good-naturedly.
The salesman quickly pointed to a small button near the CD player.
Ms. Passe smiled.
</P>
<P>
   For the Passes, it had come down to a choice between a Jeep
Grand Cherokee and this Lexus, both priced at roughly $32,000. But
based on their experience owning a Lexus sedan, Passe seemed fairly
sure of what their final decision would be. And they did later buy
the Lexus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love the Lexus experience,'' Passe said. ``And the service?
Well, there isn't any comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Toyota Motor Corp. created the Lexus brand a decade
ago, families like the Passes have gradually developed a fierce
loyalty to it, transforming this upstart _ initially seen as an
unlikely threat to BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Lincoln and Cadillac _ into
a major automotive success story.
</P>
<P>
   How did Lexus, even with designs that are often called bland,
become one of the top-selling American luxury cars, behind only
Lincoln, Cadillac and Mercedes?
</P>
<P>
   Its quick ascent provides a vivid lesson in how a mass marketer
can carve out new territory. For one thing, Toyota created a
distinct identity for Lexus by making it one of the first brands to
focus on more than just the car, providing owners a level of
service that had not been seen in the industry but that is now
emulated by competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota kept Lexus dealerships separate and did not dilute the
brand with low-priced, less luxurious vehicles to attract buyers.
And thanks to Toyota's deep pockets, Lexus could respond quickly to
changing tastes by offering new models.
</P>
<P>
   A look at the Lexus strategy, in fact, points up the missteps
made by the Honda Motor Co. and the Nissan Motor Co., which
launched their own upscale brands, Acura and Infiniti, in the
United States at about the same time. From the start, Lexus took
aim at the status-conscious Mercedes driver, while its Japanese
rivals offered a broader lineup, making it harder for them to crack
the top end of the market later.
</P>
<P>
   Infiniti and Acura are still recovering. In the first nine
months of 1998, Lexus sold about 112,000 cars and light trucks in
the United States, a 59 percent increase over the comparable period
a year earlier _ and more than BMW, which sold about 98,000, up 4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes has sold 124,000 vehicles this year, up 56 percent.
Meanwhile, Infiniti sales fell 11 percent, to 44,000, and Acura's
sagged 7 percent, to 82,000, even as they both offered hefty
discounts to increase sales.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if the long economic boom does falter, sales of all
luxury cars will surely suffer. But for now, Lexus is thriving.
``Of all the Japanese luxury brands, Lexus is the only one that
could be called a success,'' said Eric Noble, an analyst with
AutoPacific, an automobile marketing and product consulting company
in Santa Ana, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``Infiniti, Lexus and Acura all do a pretty good job of handling
the consumer,'' he said. But, he noted, ``Lexus has products that
are what the consumer wants.''
</P>
<P>
   By striving from the outset to match Mercedes' prestige, Lexus
took hold more quickly in this country, said Susan Jacobs,
president of Jacobs &AMP; Associates, a consulting company in
Rutherford, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, Lexus' focus on service earned it loyal
customers. Lexus was one of the first to offer a replacement car
while a customer's car was being repaired, showroom breakfast
buffets and free lifetime car washes. The company also sponsored
opera and jazz events.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its connection to Toyota, Lexus inherited a
reputation for value and reliability, said Scott F. Merlis,
president of Merlis Automotive International Inc., a Westport,
Conn., investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were able to tap into Toyota's product development system
and broaden the line quickly,'' he said. Lexus, which began with
two sedans, now has eight models.
</P>
<P>
   The element of surprise also worked to Lexus' advantage,
according to Ms. Jacobs. When the first Lexus models hit showrooms
in 1989, existing luxury-car makers, especially the Europeans, took
little notice. ``They didn't believe that a start-up luxury brand
could threaten their 100-year heritage,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, all the Japanese auto makers _ Lexus included _ made
missteps in the mid-1990s that hurt sales. Lexus mistakenly
increased prices just as the Europeans slashed theirs by as much as
15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Lexus also relied on its reputation too heavily for too long and
was slow to make noticeable design changes, said John Casesa, an
analyst at Schroder &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Europeans so effectively responded to the initial Japanese
attack,'' he said, ``that it's taken Lexus nine years of slugging
away with the same message and the same product positioning'' to
gain sales from those who previously owned European luxury cars.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, some critics said, Lexus also updated cars by
copying style changes from other makers. A Lexus sport model
brought out in the fall of 1997, for instance, offered oval
headlights similar to those introduced by Mercedes two years
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Acura, initially somewhere between a Honda and
a full-scale luxury line, tried to revamp its image as a true
luxury-car maker. But it merely confused customers by altering its
model names in 1995, switching from brand names to a European-style
mix of letters and numbers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, its plan to retire the name Integra, just when the
car was the best-selling and most widely known Acura model, was
quickly abandoned. Yet the very existence of the Integra, starting
at a humble $16,000, and the lack of a powerful V-8 flagship model
has made it difficult for Acura to gain true luxury status.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``By having a vehicle like Integra, it isn't clear it's a luxury
car,'' said Lincoln Merrihew, an analyst for J.D. Power &AMP;
Associates, a marketing information company. ``It's about image.''
</P>
<P>
   Infiniti has tried to stake out its own territory in a crowded
field, mimicking BMW by focusing on unique design and superior
handling and performance. But because of financial problems at
Nissan, the company, whose exterior designs differed the most from
then-current luxury models, was least able to update models and
expand its product line to respond to competitors' lower prices.
Infiniti's early advertising campaign, widely considered bizarre
because it did not show any cars, also hurt its launch.
</P>
<P>
   Each auto maker has had some success revamping its lines and
introducing new models. Acura's redesigned TL sedan, for example,
nudged ahead of a comparable Lexus in sales in September. Backed by
Honda's strong reputation as an engine maker, Acura now plans to
focus on building high-performance cars aimed at enthusiast
drivers, said Jeff Conrad, Acura's national vice president for
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Infiniti, taking a similar tack, plans to introduce a
high-performance car aimed at empty-nest baby boomers. The company
will also introduce one new car each year for the next four years,
said Steve Kight, Infiniti's marketing director.
</P>
<P>
   Lexus, which had initially sold itself as a lower-cost answer to
Mercedes but then let prices balloon, charged back by refocusing on
value, introducing new models like the GS 400 sport sedan. It also
redesigned several models, like its entry-level ES 300 and
top-of-the-line sedan, the LS 400, adding features while
maintaining or cutting prices.
</P>
<P>
   And Lexus is only now beginning to redesign some models in
response to criticism that its cars are dependable but unexciting,
Casesa and Noble said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the introduction of the RX 300 _ which even Cadillac's
general manager, John F. Smith, calls the best blending of car and
truck attributes _ Lexus is seeking to establish a name as a
trendsetter as well.
</P>
<P>
   Lexus' midsized model follows closely on the heels of Mercedes'
new small sport utility vehicle, which has sold extremely well.
Both appeal to drivers who want the comforts of a luxury car along
with the best attributes of sport utilities. But the Mercedes is
more rugged than the Lexus, and thus closer in feel to larger
American sport utilities.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller Lexus sport utility vehicle, available only since
March, and the LX 470, an upgraded version of the Toyota Land
Cruiser, now account for about 30 percent of Lexus sales in the
United States and makes Lexus the only luxury brand offering two
models in one of the fastest growing and most profitable corners of
the market.
</P>
<P>
   In July, it also helped make Lexus briefly the best-selling
luxury brand in this country. Lexus sold 14,673 vehicles that
month.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of the RX 300 seems to be that it offers the high
perch and four-wheel drive of a sport utility vehicle without some
of the drawbacks, like poor ride and truck-like handling. It is
also lower to the ground than most larger sport utilities and thus
easier to climb into.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an example of their willingness to push the envelope,''
Merrihew said. ``It's luxury applied to a part of the market that
hasn't seen it before.''
</P>
<P>
   And in luxury cars, a stable of fresh, exciting products is key.
</P>
<P>
   ``Product is about 90 percent of the game,'' said Smith of
Cadillac, which pushed out its large sport utility model, the
Escalade, in 10 months. The Escalade, a version of GMC's Yukon
Denali, will appear in showrooms this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Right now new models, like sport utility vehicles, ``drive a lot
of showroom traffic,'' bringing in customers who may end up buying
cars instead.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac plans to introduce one new car model each year as it
works to develop its own hybrid sport utility, which will be
available in a few years. BMW is about two years away as well.
</P>
<P>
   Lexus' efforts to rev up its image, moving from dependable
stalwart to maker of vehicles offering a more exciting driving
experience, is a tack other luxury-car makers are taking to appeal
to younger buyers.
</P>
<P>
   BMW, whose cars have always had a reputation for high
performance and driving excitement, already has an edge here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be a moving target,'' says Bryan Bergsteinsson, the
Lexus group vice president and general manager. Speaking of the
company's competition, he said, ``If they can follow us, when they
get there, we'll be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   But this time around, it will not be as easy, Ms. Jacobs and
other analysts forecast.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're finding the right ideas to make themselves stand
out,'' she said. But ``Lexus now is playing on a much more level
playing field than in the early 1990s. The Europeans are more aware
of the threat Lexus can pose.''

NEW MOVE ON RUSHDIE EXPOSES IRANIAN RIFTS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DOUGLAS JEHL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ A month after Iran's government dissociated
itself from death threats to the British author Salman Rushdie, the
decision is still exposing fissures among Iran's rival centers of
power.
</P>
<P>
   A majority in Iran's conservative-dominated Parliament has
signed a letter insisting that a religious decree calling for
Rushdie's death for blasphemy against Islam is still valid. They
also declared that Muslims had a duty to carry out the decree.
</P>
<P>
   Although Iran's foreign minister, Kamal Kharazzi, said on Sept.
24 that his country would not aid or reward anyone who killed
Rushdie, two hard-line Iranian groups have since publicly vowed to
carry out the 1989 decree, and they have offered new bounties on
the author's life.
</P>
<P>
   And last Friday, in the latest of several anti-government
demonstrations, at least 75 members of the hard-line Ansar
e-Hezbollah gathered in Tehran to issue new threats against
Rushdie, unveiling a three-story mural dedicated to the memory of a
man they said tried to kill the author nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't obey the foreign minister,'' chanted a member of the
group, which has long been linked to violence and is believed to
have the backing of high-level clerics in the government.
``Remember our faces, Salman Rushdie. We will kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   According to journalists who were present, Iranian security
forces made no effort to break up the demonstration, and neither
has the government made any evident effort to silence the
organizations now offering bounties of more than $3 million payable
on Rushdie's death.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats and political experts say the protests by
conservatives have underscored the powerful constraints still
facing the government of President Mohammad Khatami, a relative
moderate, as he seeks to reshape his country's image with a gentler
face.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this must be seen as part of the broader challenge to
Khatami,'' a Western diplomat said in a telephone interview.
``There are a lot of people determined to oppose him everywhere he
turns, and the Rushdie case is one in which some conservatives are
trying to portray his stance as a betrayal.''
</P>
<P>
   Many powerful figures in Iran _ including those who dominate
Parliament, the judiciary, and the office of the current supreme
leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei _ have interpreted the landslide
victory won by Khatami in the country's May 1997 presidential
elections as a threat to their long hold on power. And some
conservatives see the government's new stance on the Rushdie case
as deviating from the Islamic republic's strict religious
principles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call on the government to apologize for this mistake,'' a
group of war veterans said last week in announcing that it would
collect $333,000 to be paid to anyone who assassinated Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the renewed threats, the British government, which
restored full diplomatic relations with Iran after Kharazzi's
announcement, has said it has no reason to believe that Iran has
changed its position. And on Monday, a group of international
committees that had campaigned on behalf of Rushdie announced in
Norway that they had agreed to disband in recognition of a deal
that they said had reduced the risk to the author's life.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rushdie, who last month pronounced himself a free man for
the first time in nearly a decade, met on Friday with the British
foreign secretary, Robin Cook, to review the latest developments.
</P>
<P>
   The religious decree, or fatwa, against Rushdie was issued by
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who was the country's supreme leader
but who died several months later. Islamic scholars have said no
one else has the right to lift the ruling, which accused Rushdie of
having defamed Islam with his novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
</P>
<P>
   Since that time, Iran's policy has been that it did not
officially sanction the death decree. But Kharazzi's more gentle
restatement of that position, made during talks in New York with
British officials, reflected the temperate tone that Khatami has
brought to Iranian politics.
</P>
<P>
   Kharazzi pledged that Iran would not encourage or assist anybody
in threatening Rushdie's life. He also dissociated the government
from the bounty that a powerful religious charity, the 15th Khordad
Foundation, has put the author's head. But since his announcement,
that foundation has announced that it would add $300,000 to a
bounty that already stood at $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   And the newspaper Kayhan reported on Sunday that another bounty
had been offered by the 2,000 residents of Kiyapay village in
northern Iran. A village official quoted by the paper said the
residents had opened a bank account to gather donations and had
pledged to provide farmland, fruit gardens, ``a house, and 10
carpets as a reward for carrying out the execution sentence against
the author of the blasphemous book.''

 &HT;    YMCA named after a good sport
 &HT;    By Maria Saporta
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At Tuesday's groundbreaking of the new Buckhead YMCA,
a fragrant aroma of statesmanship permeated the now smelly world of
politics.
</P>
<P>
   It was a moment to honor one of Georgia's elder statesmen _
former Gov. Carl Sanders, a longtime champion of YMCAs.
</P>
<P>
   An anonymous donor had given $500,000 to have the $12 million
YMCA named after Sanders, who served as the Democratic governor of
Georgia from 1963 to 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the donor was none other than Guy Millner, founder
of Norrell Corp., who is the Republican nominee for governor this
year running against Democrat Roy Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   But the lead gift was made two years ago, long before Millner
began his latest race for governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guy's feelings toward the YMCA are similar to mine,'' Sanders
said. ``It goes way back.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said it would be inaccurate to read any political
implications in the Millner gift. ``Both Roy Barnes and Guy Millner
are friends of mine,'' he said. ``That's the reason you haven't
seen my name on either side.''
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between Sanders and Millner also goes beyond
politics. Sanders serves as a director on Norrell's board.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came to Atlanta, I first ran into Carl Sanders running
the track at the Luckie Street Y,'' Millner said Tuesday. ``I think
Carl served our state and community well. He was a progressive
governor and an outstanding citizen and contributor to Atlanta and
Georgia. It was very appropriate to have the Y named after him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Metro Atlanta YMCA has been on an ambitious building
campaign, raising $28 million in the past five years, according to
Fred Bradley, the organization's president.
</P>
<P>
   But the Carl E. Sanders Family YMCA will be the most significant
project to date. The 54,000-square-foot facility on Moores Mill
Road near I-75 will have 10 tennis courts, a gymnasium, children's
center, workout areas, aquatic center, aerobics areas, meeting
rooms and family locker rooms.
</P>
<P>
   It replaces the old Buckhead YMCA, which was sold for
redevelopment. In addition to the $3.3 million raised in the
community, the organization is borrowing about $4.5 million to
build the project.
</P>
<P>
   Metro Atlanta YMCA Chairman Lawrence Gellerstedt III, who is CEO
of American Business Products, thanked the 600 Buckhead Y members
who ``hung in there, first with an old facility and then with no
facility.''
</P>
<P>
   And they won't have a place to go for at least a year. The new
Buckhead Y is jokingly being called, ``Y2K,'' because it is slated
to open on Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders finds modern campaigns distasteful
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, 73, wistfully remembered the good old days of political
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure am glad I'm not involved in a political campaign
running for some office,'' he said. ``I can't believe how different
campaigns and television commercials are today compared to when I
was running.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, we have got to get away from the idea that the only
way you can win an election is to see how badly you can destroy
your opponent, rather than seeking the support of the voter based
upon issues the public is most concerned about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just precludes so many people in thinking about getting
involved in the public arena. It still is an honor to serve the
public, but it's a tremendous sacrifice. Some way, somehow, it's
got to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders also complimented the tenure of Gov. Zell Miller. ``He's
been the finest governor in my lifetime. He has earned all the
accolades he's been given.''
</P>
<P>
   Good to be back home
</P>
<P>
   When Miller held a reception at the Governor's Mansion last week
for friend, former legislator and author Matt Towery, one of the
guests was former Gov. Lester Maddox.
</P>
<P>
   Miller acknowledged Maddox, still spry at 83, and the former
governor said, without missing a beat, ``It's good to be back
home.''
</P>
<P>
   When Towery commented on the number of Republicans and Democrats
at the reception, Maddox yelled out, ``I'm the only one who beat
both the Democrats and the Republicans.''

 &HT;    Ralph David Abernathy III indicted on 35 countsBy Rhonda Cook
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When a Fulton County grand jury returned a 35-count
felony indictment against state Sen. Ralph David Abernathy III
Tuesday on charges he lied to get $13,000 in state funds, it broke
the hearts of those who had worked with the legislator's renowned
father to win civil rights for black people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sad for him, and I'm sad for his family,'' said the Rev.
Joseph Lowery, a core member of the group that worked with Ralph
David Abernathy Sr. and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. during the
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Said the Rev. Hosea Williams, another King aide: ``When I think
of how his father sacrificed and suffered. The added hurt to my
heart is seeing the Abernathy name being drug through the mud.''
</P>
<P>
   Abernathy, a Democrat whose 34th District represents western
Fulton County and part of Cobb, is charged with 10 counts each of
theft by taking, making a false statement and violating of his oath
of office; four counts of forgery; and one count of influencing a
witness.
</P>
<P>
   The Fulton County grand jury indictment caps a Georgia Bureau of
Investigation probe into allegations that the senator forged the
names of volunteers and falsely claimed expenses or that he paid
employees for services like writing speeches. The indictment also
said Abernathy offered to pay a staffer $2,700 after the GBI
investigation began so she could substantiate Abernathy's claim
that he had paid her for legislative services. The felonies carry
prison sentences ranging from one to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Fulton County Judge John Langford set his bond at
$25,000. He is supposed to surrender by 6 p.m. Wednesday at the
Fulton County Jail and post bond.
</P>
<P>
   The last time a legislator was indicted was in 1992. State Sen.
Hildred Schumake and state Rep. Frank Redding were indicted on
separate federal extortion charges. Schumake's charges were dropped
after two mistrials, and Redding pleaded guilty to trying to extort
cash from undercover agents in return for stopping legislation that
would have shut harmed strip club businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the 19 grand jurors voted, Abernathy made a short
statement to them, denying that he had done anything illegal,
according to his attorney, Steve Strelzik. The law allows public
officials the special right to speak to a grand jury considering
charges against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's absolutely not guilty,'' Strelzik told reporters outside
the grand jury room of the Fulton County Courthouse as Abernathy
left the building via a back stairwell.
</P>
<P>
   Abernathy's attorneys and some of his friends questioned the
timing of the indictment, which comes two weeks before state
Attorney General Thurbert Baker, who brought the charges, faces the
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is absolutely astounding,'' said state Rep. Tyrone Brooks
(D-Atlanta) another key player in the 1960s civil rights movement.
``It just seems to be this is dirty, low-down politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker denied any political motivation. ``I'm going to make sure
we pursue public corruption wherever that might lead us,'' Baker
said. ``This office does not bend to the political winds of this
state.''
</P>
<P>
   The indictment is the latest trouble for the son of one of the
pre-eminent civil rights leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS recently took documents from Abernathy's legislative
office as part of a similar federal investigation. Atlanta news
organizations reported earlier this year that there were letters on
the computer hard drive from Abernathy's legislative office
indicating the senator had hoped to get a $150,000 loan by using
his influence to obtain a Fulton County medical contract for a
friend.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the year, Abernathy was disqualified from running for
re-election when his $400 qualifying check bounced. And in
December, Abernathy was caught at Hartsfield International Airport
with marijuana in his underwear. He was fined $500, and a month
later, his Senate colleagues gave him a public reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   He had other highly publicized problems in 1994. In January, he
paid a fine for leading police on a high-speed chase through East
Point. Six months later, a woman said Abernathy barged in on her
while she was using a stall in an unmarked state Capitol restroom
and refused to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest tragedy is this will chip away at the legacy of
his father,'' Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   Lowry was also concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not as bad as you might think'' Lowery said. ``He's had a
streak of bad luck that became high profile. I deeply regret what
has happened, and I hope and pray that it's a mistake that he can
clear it up.''

HOUSE OVERWHELMINGLY APPROVES NEW FEDERAL BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After bemoaning the closed-door, last-minute haste
that produced the federal budget, the House on Tuesday night
overwhelmingly approved the $500-billion catch-all spending
package, an unwieldy, 40-pound document that ran nearly 4,000 pages
and that virtually no one had time to read before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   With the entire House up for re-election in just two weeks and
most lawmakers anxious to get home to campaign, the House voted
333-95 to accept the colossal package, copies of which arrived on
the House floor for review by members less than four hours before
Tuesday night's vote. Republican leaders had to rely on Democrats
to help pass the bill. In the end, 170 Democrats joined 162
Republicans and one independent to support it, while 64 Republicans
and 31 Democrats voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest defection came from conservatives, who complained
that the bill raided this year's anticipated budget surplus,
provided no serious tax cut and expanded spending for social
programs. They blamed President Clinton and liberals, but they held
House Speaker Newt Gingrich accountable for what they said was his
selling out his revolutionary fervor of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the vote, Gingrich roared back, presenting himself
on the House floor as a statesman and a consensus-builder. He
denounced the conservative firebrands, his former allies for whom
he was once their spokesman, as ``perfectionists'' who did not
understand the art of compromise and who had become ``petty
dictators'' in their own little worlds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surely those of us who have grown up and matured in this
process understand after the last four years we have to work
together on big issues,'' he declared. ``If we don't work together
on big issues, nothing gets done.''
</P>
<P>
   He said of the final cost of the package: ``Yes our liberal
friends get a few things, and in a free society when you are
sharing power between the legislative and executive branch, that is
precisely the outcome you should expect to get.''
</P>
<P>
   The omnibus bill, which allocates money for hundreds of programs
large and small and incorporates numerous policy decisions that
Congress never debated, now goes to the Senate. Along with many
House members, several senators expressed outrage on Tuesday at the
final price tag and the 11th-hour wheeling and dealing among
congressional leaders and the White House that brought the spending
package to fruition. But the Senate is expected to it on Wednesday
anyway, bringing down the curtain on the 105th Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The package accounts for about one-third of the $1.7-trillion
budget. After a generation of deficits, it includes a surplus, but
many members were infuriated that it spends about $20 billion of
the anticipated $70 billion surplus for ``emergency'' tasks, from
immunizing the government's computers to the 2000 bug to helping
farmers trying to cope with the loss of Asian export markets.
</P>
<P>
   Anger at the Republican leaders for spending so much and for
turning the budget into a free-form bazaar dominated by
special-interest pleadings came from across the political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., who is chairman of the
Appropriations Committee, called the process ``ugly'' and said, ``I
hated it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the Capitol, Sen. Robert Byrd of West
Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee who
is famous for the huge amount of pork-barrel spending he directs to
his home state, complained: ``This is a creation without a mother
or father. It's more like a Frankenstein monster patched together
from old legislative body parts that don't quite fit.''
</P>
<P>
   But those grievances, once aired, seemed to melt in the face of
more money for most congressional districts and a widespread desire
to get the whole thing over with and with Gingrich's impassioned
plea for support.

 &HT;    Florida man's family baffled by murders
 &HT;    By Mark Bixler
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEESBURG, Fla. _ They came to Alice Gutkowski's house Monday
morning with a pot of coffee and good intentions; three neighbors
in a central Florida retirement community trying to do what little
they could to help their friend through a very hard time.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, a maid in a high-rise hotel in downtown Atlanta,
more than 400 miles away, had discovered the bodies of Gutkowski's
51-year-old husband, Ronald, one of his co-workers, Gerrold
Shropshire, 50; and Phillip Dover, a 31-year-old business associate
from Gainesville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   They were in Atlanta to see the Falcons battle the New Orleans
Saints in the Georgia Dome on Sunday afternoon. Police say each man
was shot in the head between midnight and 8 a.m. Sunday, when a
maid opened the door to their room on the 24th floor of the Atlanta
Hilton &AMP; Towers.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, as the sun rose above the sprawling Highland Lakes
retirement community, Kathryn Benning and two neighbors came to try
to console Alice Gutkowski.
</P>
<P>
   ``She hadn't slept all night,'' Benning said. ``She was just
crying and crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Her son, Chris, a 23-year-old college student, had a premonition
about his father's trip, Benning said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said Oh, I'm so sorry about your father.' He said, It's just
bad,' and he hung his head,'' she said. ``He didn't really want his
dad to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Benning and two neighbors sat on a sofa with Alice Gutkowski for
an hour or so, hugging her when she cried and listening as she
tried to describe her shock. A neighbor plugged in a coffee pot and
poured a few cups.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's just so broken up about it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 1,500 people _ nearly all are 55 or older _ live in the
Gutkowski's neighborhood, a neat and quiet place where fountains in
front of some palm trees at the entranceway spray water two or
three feet into the air and people steer golf carts to the
clubhouse for card games or square-dancing lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Gutkowski drove down those streets most weekday mornings
for the last four years, since he and his family moved to Leesburg,
Fla., about 40 miles north of Orlando, from Long Island, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   He and Shropshire worked in the office at Lester Coggins
Trucking Inc., a company in nearby Okahumpka, Fla., whose 300
drivers haul freight to the continental 48 states.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Denhof, the company's general manager, said both employees
were fine men on and off the job.
</P>
<P>
   He bristled at the notion that the killings were somehow related
to illegal drugs, describing Gutkowski and Shropshire as family men
who spent a good deal of time in church.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't find nicer people. It just doesn't make sense to
us,'' he said. ``I think they got mixed up with some bad people in
Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Gutkowski attended Sunday mass at St. Paul's Catholic Church in
Leesburg. Shropshire went to New Covenant Baptist Church in
Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Their co-workers at the trucking company had taped a yellow
flier over the company suggestion box by Tuesday afternoon
announcing the creation of a fund to help the relatives that both
men left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all kind of reeling from it,'' Denhof said. ``They were
just well-respected people and everyone's shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his company had been ``bombarded'' with calls from
newspaper and television reporters. Relatives at the Gutkowski's
house spoke with reporters early in the day but declined to be
interviewed later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough is enough,'' one said.

 &HT;    MindSpring shows bounce in its earnings
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ MindSpring Enterprises on Wednesday posted its fourth
consecutive profitable quarter and once again beat analysts'
forecasts. The company reported a profit of $4 million, or 15 cents
a share.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts surveyed by First Call had expected MindSpring to earn
11 cents a share. MindSpring closed Tuesday at $31.25, up $1.31
1/4. During the same period last year, MindSpring lost $627,000, or
3 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based Internet service provider _ the largest ISP in
the Southeast and the largest independent ISP in the country _
reported third-quarter revenue of $28.7 million, vs. $14 million
for the same period last year. MindSpring's subscriber base
increased to 455,000, up from 393,000 in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are proud of what MindSpring has accomplished to date,''
said company Chairman Charles Brewer in a statement. ``In the third
quarter we expanded our member base 16 percent from the prior
quarter while posting our fourth consecutive quarter of record
profits.''
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the third quarter, MindSpring Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer Michael Misikoff, said: ``We are pleased
with the performance for the quarter and happy to see subscriber
growth increase over the quarter. We are also happy to see we were
able to contain costs and earn a little bit more per share than
people were expecting.''
</P>
<P>
   Misikoff said subscriber growth was due to dial-up membership
and Web hosting. Membership growth from the SpryNet acquisition
will show up in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, Misikoff says the company
will face new challenges. A top priority is integrating subscribers
of the recently acquired SpryNet ISP into the MindSpring fold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have significant challenges facing us in the fourth
quarter,'' Misikoff said. ``We will have to successfully transition

 &HT;    Attorneys say smokers have themselves to blame
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ A day after hearing lawyers for sick smokers paint
tobacco companies as greedy and deceitful, jurors in the first
class action lawsuit against the industry to go to trial heard
defense lawyers argue that smokers are responsible for their own
habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is about the choice to smoke and about what people
knew about the health risks of smoking when they made the choice to
smoke,'' attorney Robert C. Heim, who is representing Philip
Morris, told the six-member panel. ``It's about quitting smoking
and it's about responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   It is an argument that has won for tobacco companies in most
previous lawsuits, but plaintiffs' attorneys are banking on
anti-smoking sentiment to help as many as 500,000 Florida smokers
win from tobacco companies damages that some observers believe
could reach $200 billion. On Monday, plaintiffs' lawyer Stanley
Rosenblatt said the companies have a long history of hiding
evidence and trying to convince the public that there is doubt
about whether smoking is dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Heim countered that companies have been responsible and
reasonable, and that the health impact of the habit has been known
for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1604, the King of England wrote a book about smoking,
saying it was unhealthy,'' said Heim, who also noted that tobacco's
history is so woven into the American fabric that tobacco leaves
grace the columns on the U.S. Capitol Building. ``Henry Ford
wouldn't let his workers smoke because he believed it was
unhealthy, and Thomas Edison did the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the dangers of smoking have been known for so long,
smokers can't argue that they weren't informed when they took up
the habit, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Heim also argued that smoking is not addictive in the sense that
heroin is addictive, and that people can quit if they choose.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the United States, 1.5 million people quit smoking every
year,'' he said. ``Over the last 30 years, 46 million Americans
have quit smoking and quit smoking for good.''

 &HT;    Weekend of fun for men turns into heartbreak for survivorsBy
Lyda Longa and Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the everyday lives of Phillip Dover, Gerrold
Shropshire and Ronald Gutkowski, last weekend was to have been an
exciting high point: Dinner in Atlanta, an extravagant stay at one
of the city's upscale hotels on Saturday night and a pro football
game on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Though Gutkowski, who worked with Shropshire at a trucking
company in Okahumpka, Fla., wanted to stay at a cheaper hotel
outside the city, Shropshire insisted on the Atlanta Hilton &AMP;
Towers.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a one-night stay and they could split the $180 cost
of the room. Besides, the Atlanta Falcons tickets were free,
provided by Dover's trucking broker company, GTO 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish he had never made that trip,'' Maple Bronner said of
Shropshire, her fiancee. ``I remember Ronnie saying they should
stay at a smaller, less expensive hotel. But Gerrold wanted to have
fun. He really wanted Ronnie to have a good time also and they were
really looking forward to this trip. It's all they talked about.''
</P>
<P>
   A hotel maid found all three men shot to death in Room 2417 at
about 8 a.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta police reported no progress on their investigation into
the slayings Tuesday, but did say they had found no ties to the
drug world with any of the victims. They did not retreat from their
earlier statements, however, that the killings appeared to have
been more than a random crime.
</P>
<P>
   Shropshire, who had recently turned 50, was engaged to Bronner,
lived in the Orlando suburb of Altamonte Springs, was a deacon in
his church and manager at Coggins Trucking Co.
</P>
<P>
   Gutkowski, 51, lived in Leesburg, Fla., with his wife Alice and
was a supervisor for Coggins Trucking.
</P>
<P>
   Dover, 31, was single, lived in an apartment in Gainesville,
Ga., about 50 miles northeast of Atlanta, and was a dispatcher with
GTO.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Cornett, the head of GTO, and Scott Shope, another
dispatcher for the company and Dover's roommate until August, said
Dover had become friends with Shropshire through his job.
</P>
<P>
   As a dispatcher it was Dover's job to find the best freight
price for client shippers, and this is done by dealing with
dispatchers at trucking firms. Once a deal is struck, it is the
broker dispatcher's duty to monitor its progress through delivery.
The shipper pays the broker, and the broker then pays the freight
company.
</P>
<P>
   Shope said Dover and Shropshire had gone to other sporting
events together, but Cornett said this was the first time that
Dover had used the company's Falcon tickets.
</P>
<P>
   There were four tickets, Shope said, and it was his
understanding that Dover had invited Shropshire and told him to
bring a friend. Shope said Dover had offered him the fourth ticket,
but he was unable to go.
</P>
<P>
   Bronner was also offered the ticket, but because she was to
undergo surgery several days before the football game, she decided
to stay home.
</P>
<P>
   Clarence Dover, Phillip's father, said he talked to his son
``toward the middle of last week'' and the young man asked if he
would like to go to Sunday's game. ``I told him I'd love to go, and
said, 'If you don't find anyone else, call me back.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dover never called back, his father said, and that was the last
time they spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Bronner, who had met Dover earlier this year when she and
Shropshire traveled to Atlanta to see the Braves on some of Dover's
tickets, said she talked by phone to Dover on Saturday night.
Shropshire had called to check in before the three men went out to
dinner and Dover chatted with her from the hotel room for a few
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   During their conversation, Shropshire apparently told Bronner
that he and his friends would not drive anywhere, but instead would
walk around downtown so they could explore. They promised they'd
call after they returned to the hotel from dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Bronner said she had awakened Sunday morning in her Orlando home
wondering why Shropshire, a man she described as generous and
attentive, had not called the night before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole day went by and I was growing more and more
concerned,'' Bronner said. ``Finally I got a call from Gerrold's
daughter Kimberly, who lives in Raleigh, North Carolina. She had
gotten a call from Atlanta police asking about her father.''
</P>
<P>
   Early Monday morning, Orlando police officers showed up at
Bronner's home.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family didn't want me to go outside and talk to police,''
Bronner said. ``My daughter spoke to them instead and she came back
inside and told me Gerrold was dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Atlanta police had speculated late Sunday and early
Monday that the murders may have been drug-related, Maj. Mickey
Lloyd on Tuesday emphatically said that police had failed to find a
``narcotics connection to any of the three victims.''
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd said the victims' cars were taken to the GBI's crime lab
Tuesday morning for further investigation. ``There are certain
aspects of cases that are routine. We can't discuss it any
further,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Bill Campbell echoed comments of police Monday, saying
that the killings were ``not random'' and should not make anyone
feel unsafe downtown.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Campbell told a reporter: ``We will continue to get
the message out about downtown being safe. Interestingly enough,
there were tens of thousands of people in downtown for the Saints
game with the Falcons, or just coming to enjoy a pleasant weekend
in Atlanta. I don't think any of them saw or heard, or felt unsafe
while they were here. This tragedy is, I think, an individual act
that must be seen in that context.''
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the insistence of family and friends of the three
men that they wouldn't have been involved in drugs or illicit
activities, the mayor's spokesman, Jabari Simama, said Tuesday the
mayor stands by his earlier comments speculating that the killings
were ``not random.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the victims were forced to lie on their stomachs and
were shot in the back of the head, and because there was no sign of
forced entry into the hotel room, police believe his earlier
statements are accurate, Simama said. ``Random acts of killing
generally don't exhibit that type of planning.''

IBM SAYS PROFIT ROSE 10 PERCENT BUT WARNS OF UNCERTAINTIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   IBM reported a 10 percent increase in third-quarter earnings
Tuesday because of stronger computer sales, but the company's
executives warned that global economic uncertainty could lead to
short-term problems in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, the world's largest computer company, posted a profit of
$1.49 billion, or $1.56 a diluted share, compared with $1.36
billion, or $1.35 a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Revenue
for the period increased 8 percent, to $20.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The results were slightly above analysts' expectations of $1.53
a share, and the anticipation of a strong quarter had pushed the
company's stock up $10 over the last week, to a new 52-week
intraday high of $142.4375 Tuesday before retreating. The stock
fell $1.50, to $137.875, before the third-quarter earnings were
announced.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the numbers is a mixed business story. The company's
sales of hardware, from its giant mainframes to personal computers,
increased by 4.2 percent, to $8.7 billion. This is a turnaround
from the first half of 1998, when a glut of personal computers and
delays in mainframe purchases hurt sales.
</P>
<P>
   The company's information technology services segment, which
provides software and computer equipment services to corporations,
was also strong, with revenue rising by 22.6 percent, to $5.7
billion. (IBM does not release earnings results for individual
business segments.) The company attributed this rise to a desire by
corporations to improve computer-related business efficiencies when
faced with an economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
   On the negative side, however, was a decline in business in Asia
and Latin America along with continued problems in the company's
microelectronics business, which reflects severe price competition
in the manufacture of computer memory chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``While IBM is entering the fourth quarter with some real
momentum,'' said Louis Gerstner Jr., the company's chairman and
chief executive, ``we are facing a number of significant short-term
issues, including an uncertain global economic environment, ongoing
weaknesses in some parts of Asia and Latin America and continued
price pressures in semiconductors.''
</P>
<P>
   With strong earnings against a backdrop of business uncertainty,
IBM's chief financial officer, Douglas Maine, warned in a
conference call with analysts against overly optimistic
fourth-quarter earnings estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we are pleased with our strong third-quarter
performance,'' he said, ``economic uncertainties should lead to a
conclusion not to raise earnings estimates.''
</P>
<P>
   David Takata, an analyst at Gruntal &AMP; Co., said: ``The good news
is that IBM wasn't hit as bad as what the worst fears might have
indicated. I'm conservative, and I've expected the company to get
hit with some economic fallout. But it just hasn't happened yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Helmig, an analyst at Soundview Technology Group, said,
``Loud and clear, we got a lot of good news.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They certainly had a strong revenue performance and they are
well positioned in Europe and North America for a sustained
performance,'' he added. ``Still, with currency risks and with the
world economic scene, we'd all be better off to watch and see how
it unfolds rather than taking the good news of the moment and
increasing our expectations. That's the prudent approach.''
</P>
<P>
   With a cost reduction program in place, most of the increase in
revenue fell to the bottom line. Still, the company's gross profit
margin of 37.2 percent in the 1998 third quarter fell slightly,
compared with 38.2 percent in the quarter a year earlier.

GOLDMAN SACHS NAMES 57 NEW PARTNERS ON EVE OF PUBLIC OFFERING  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH KAHN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. named 57 new partners Tuesday,
awarding them an ownership stake in the world's most profitable
private partnership with the promise of a lucrative public offering
down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Among those named was Abby Joseph Cohen, Goldman's chief
portfolio strategist. Ms. Cohen's positive predictions about the
stock market made her a Wall Street superstar in the 1990s, but her
reputation suffered after the sharp summer selloff that raised the
specter of a bear market.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street firm will add the 57 to its current roster of
189 partners. But 20 to 25 existing partners are expected to retire
_ or become limited in Goldman's parlance _ before the firm's
fiscal year ends on Nov. 28. Some of those people will retire
voluntarily, executives of the firm said, while others will be
pushed out to make way for the younger recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Being named a partner of Goldman, Sachs is one of the richest
rewards on Wall Street, with partners earning an average of more
than $1 million a year as well as building equity stakes in one of
the world's most profitable financial companies.
</P>
<P>
   For the most senior partners, that stake is valued in the
hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   This year's crop of partners will also benefit greatly if
Goldman follows through with its plan to issue shares to the public
for the first time in its 130-year history. Partners voted to take
the firm public earlier this year, a move that would have ended the
partnership and denied that status to the people offered
partnerships Tuesday. But the firm delayed the sale of shares
indefinitely last month because of turmoil in the markets and
weaker-than-expected operating profits for Goldman and other
financial companies, and it quickly revived the traditional
partnership selection process.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, Sachs names partners only every other year, and the
newest group could well be the last before Goldman does issue
shares. At that time, even the most junior ones, including those
named Tuesday, would have stakes valued in the tens of millions.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the economics of going public is not what it was a
few months ago. Even with the recent rebound in financial-company
share prices, Goldman's Wall Street peers have seen their
valuations cut in half from July peaks, meaning that Goldman
shares, if issued Wednesday or in the near future, would be
unlikely to command the high prices once envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Goldman's partners, even after subtracting for
expected retirements, would number perhaps 220, meaning that each
one would have a smaller slice of the equity than the 189 would
have.
</P>
<P>
   Less fortunate are the partners expected to retire. As limited
partners, they sacrifice their equity stakes in the firm, though
they have the option of investing in Goldman, Sachs and earning
what is often a hefty annual return on their capital. Limited
partners are expected to receive a share of the profits if Goldman
goes public, but their potential gain will be much smaller than
that of the general partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure that with the prospect of an IPO just around the
corner, there are some in that batch of retired partners who are
not too happy about it,'' a current limited partner said. ``But I
am sure there are others who just thought this was the time. You
can't wait forever, and being a Goldman partner is an extremely
demanding job.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those expected to retire this year are William J. Buckley
and Richard M. Hayden, partners in the equities division, and
Christopher Flowers of the financial institutions group. Flowers,
who helped prepare Goldman's plan to issue shares earlier this year
and is one of the most senior partners, announced his retirement
recently after he failed to win one of the top spots in the firm's
revamped executive hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cohen is the best known among the 57 new partners, who will
collect their brass rings if they accept Goldman's invitation next
month. Two other women were also named partners, bringing the total
at the firm to 17. Goldman has been criticized in the past for
having few women partners.
</P>
<P>
   Several new partners are recent recruits to Goldman. They
include Kendrick R. Wilson 3d, who was hired earlier this year and
who specializes in advising banks on mergers and acquisitions.
Goldman also lured Michael J. Carr, a mergers-and-acquisitions
specialist, away from a rival investment bank, Salomon Smith
Barney, in August, with the promise of big gains when Goldman
issued shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``These appointments recognize the contributions and potential
of some of the firm's most valued senior professionals,'' Jon S.
Corzine and Henry M. Paulson Jr., co-chairmen and co-chief
executives, said in a statement.

A LIFETIME OF KNOWING WHAT'S NEXT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 25) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOHN ROCKWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Before I start examining their edges and undersides,
let me lay my cards on the table. Harvey Lichtenstein _ who turns
70 next spring and who recently announced his retirement, effective
June 30, after 31 years as head of the Brooklyn Academy of Music _
has been the most innovative and influential performing arts
administrator New York has known.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a game, so there's no point in ticking off the
not-so-long list of his recent competitors, icons like Joe Papp,
Ellen Stewart and Morton Baum. But Papp, for one, is better known
to the general public than Lichtenstein, even now. So it's worth
trying to explain why Lichtenstein has been so important not just
to the cultural life of New York, but to the country and the world.
</P>
<P>
   Before Harvey (as anyone who even vaguely knows him calls him),
the performing arts in this city and nation were very different
from what they are today. There was the establishment uptown and
the experimental downtown, with Brooklyn so far downtown as to have
slipped off the map of Manhattan altogether.
</P>
<P>
   After Harvey, or more precisely since Harvey, because
Lichtenstein is still very much with us, the scene has been altered
irrevocably. It's not that the avant-garde has become the
establishment, exactly, as the neo-conservatives so love to argue;
there's plenty of marginal weirdness still bubbling away.
</P>
<P>
   But Lichtenstein has presided over a shift in taste whereby the
establishment-hailed innovators of yesteryear have receded into
history, to be replaced by a new generation _ one is tempted to say
a new or next wave _ that now infuses the establishment.
</P>
<P>
   That generational shift has often been called the move from
modernism to post-modernism: from stern austerity to generous
eclecticism, from abstraction to socially engaged humanism, from
word to image, from meaning to meditation. In part, Lichtenstein
has been Hegel's destiny-driven hero, like Napoleon surfing the
energies of the French Revolution, who caught a larger historical
shift and just happened to be the person who epitomized that shift.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, but Lichtenstein also had the passion and the smarts
to be that person, and to give particular artists their key career
chances, and to sustain his support for those artists year after
year, until the larger midtown Manhattan cultural institutions
finally caught on.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't just support local artists like Robert Wilson and
Steve Reich and Philip Glass and Merce Cunningham and Trisha Brown
and Bill T. Jones and Laurie Anderson and Mark Morris. He opened up
New York to the world.
</P>
<P>
   Of course Lichtenstein was not the first to import foreign
artists. But his alertness to what was going on, not just in all
corners of Europe but in the rest of the world as well, brought
fresh energy to this self-satisfied and curiously provincial city.
We live in an era of jet travel and casually portable recorded
music and videos and Internet communication.
</P>
<P>
   But it is important to give more than a few jet-setters and
back-packers the chance to see major foreign performing arts live,
because live performance still offers an immediacy that recordings
can never match. Lichtenstein has been a leader in the importation
not just of small-scaled chamber ensembles and exotic ethnicity,
but of the major performing arts institutions of foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   As such he has been a catalyst for the development of similar
cultural centers and alternative spaces around the country,
encouraging through example, development deals and co-productions
the formation of a viable touring circuit in their native land for
the artists he has fostered at BAM. And in showcasing native talent
in New York, he has facilitated the international careers of
American artists.
</P>
<P>
   Lichtenstein transformed not just local artists but local public
taste, and hence the nature of audiences first in New York, then in
the country at large. The image of the black-clad, hipper-than-thou
trendies crowding the BAM lobby at yet another premiere has become
an affectionate (or in some cases, derisory) cliche of contemporary
performing arts.
</P>
<P>
   But Lichtenstein didn't just make it hip to go to these kinds of
performances; he made these kinds of performances downright
popular, and hence alerted the custodians of the safe, richer,
maybe duller institutions across the East River, ever eager for
younger audiences, that something was happening and they'd better
find out what it was, to paraphrase Bob Dylan.
</P>
<P>
   One other little accomplishment must be mentioned. Lichtenstein
did all this in Brooklyn. Sure, production costs are lower there
than in midtown Manhattan, and sure, in retrospect one can see how
Brooklyn's very marginality helped fuel BAM's outsider status. But
hindsight is easy; hardly anyone from Manhattan regularly attended
Brooklyn performing events in the 1960s, when Lichtenstein arrived
at BAM.
</P>
<P>
   He helped restore some measure of cultural pride in that borough
_ not that it had been bereft of culture, what with the Brooklyn
Museum and other worthy institutions _ and he also managed the
seemingly impossible: making Brooklyn seem trendy, its
outer-borough isolation no longer square but hip.
</P>
<P>
   How did he do it? Aside from catching the Hegelian wave of
destiny, that is. The short answers are, through taste and passion,
through personal charisma, through a managerial style that by all
reports oscillates between the inspirationally collegial and the
petulantly dictatorial, and by brilliant strategizing and
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Let us dispense with the first two with some haste. Everything
any one person goes to see at BAM has not invariably been perfect,
perfection usually being defined as congruence with one's own
taste. Sometimes Harvey actually does make mistakes, and sometimes
he seems to bow too overtly to the availability of foreign
financial support or simple budgetary expedience.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   I recall a recent season on the most recent BAM pattern of
presenting three operas or vaguely operatic music-theater pieces
each spring under the rubric of BAM Opera. The BAMbudget (see how
easily one falls into BAM's marketing nomenclature?) was clearly
devoted almost in its entirety to William Christie and Jean-Marie
Villagier's ravishing production of Rameau's ``Hippolyte et
Aricie,'' and rightly so. But how to afford two more operas, in
order to sustain the BAM Opera series? Bring in two bare-bones,
cheap productions, one a Jonathan Miller common-man staging of
Bach's ``St. Matthew'' Passion in which everyone, even the women,
seemed to be wearing plaid shirts, and the other an Irish
chamber-opera company's no doubt worthy but by all reports
irreducibly provincial production of a Handel opera.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey, bless his heart, stoutly insisted that he
(italics)loved(end italics) all three productions. But anyone with
any experience at all in the producing business could see where the
budgetary corners had been cut.
</P>
<P>
   That all said, BAM's artistic track record in the Lichtenstein
era has been mightily impressive. The main reason people go to BAM,
and to Brooklyn to get to BAM, is not that they crave to be hip but
that they have come to trust Harvey's taste; they've seen enough
there that they have enjoyed that they are willing to risk unknown
offerings in the reasonable expectation that they will enjoy them
too.
</P>
<P>
   As far as managerial style is concerned, Lichtenstein can indeed
be bossy and hot-tempered and petulant and unreasonable. (``Cut the
production budget in half; I don't care how you do it'' may or may
not be something he actually said, but it accurately evokes the
aura he created.)
</P>
<P>
   He pinches pennies until they bleed, dunning foreign governments
and companies and co-producers for the best possible deal, and
often refuses to commit to contract until the last possible moment,
in part for added negotiating leverage. People complain but, with a
few exceptions, they keep working with him.
</P>
<P>
   And ultimately, so what? Harvey gets things done, he brings more
to BAM within budget than he could otherwise, and he has won the
loyalty of a highly talented staff, two of whom _ Karen Hopkins on
the administrative side and Joe Mellilo on the artistic side _ will
succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   He has also managed to retain the affections of some of the
great artists of the city and world, and to build and sustain a
board of directors that has supported him through thin (mostly in
the past, but Lichtenstein still takes risks) and thick (which
usually means the deficit is only as bad as predicted).
</P>
<P>
   With strategy and marketing, Lichtenstein has made some key
choices that have helped BAM establish its remarkably potent brand
image. For starters, one should remember that he did not create the
``downtown'' arts scene. Throughout his career, with a very few
exceptions, he has been a presenter, not a producer, in the sense
of directly overseeing the creation of new work.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is a very fine line between creative presentation,
co-production and production in this directly creative sense.
Artists themselves are the true creators, and at the outset they
were fostered by all manner of smaller, mostly Manhattan
performing-arts spaces, pre-eminently the Kitchen in the early
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   From the first, Lichtenstein was a shrewd observer of an extant
late 60s-early 70s scene and drew upon it. Wilson did ``The King of
Spain'' first in Manhattan in 1969. It then moved to Brooklyn in
altered form as ``The Life and Times of Sigmund Freud'' and was
subsequently incorporated into ``The Life and Times of Joseph
Stalin,'' again at BAM, in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Glass and Reich and Ms. Anderson and the rest mostly got started
in Manhattan, then moved to BAM and beyond. But in some quarters in
lower Manhattan, Lichtenstein was regarded as an interloper, a
capitalizer on others' pioneering work. BAM was the mid-stage in an
artist's development: what came after the funky lofts and before
Europe and the Metropolitan Opera.
</P>
<P>
   Does this besmirch Lichtenstein's achievement? Hardly. First of
all, he had the eye to recognize talent. Second, with engagements
and commissions and personal support, he has done more than his
share in fostering careers of artists he admires. So what if he
usually comes upon them after they have presented their earliest
work elsewhere?
</P>
<P>
   BAM's brilliant marketing extends beyond cute acronyms and
slogans (starting with BAM itself, and the Next Wave) and beyond
arresting advertising campaigns to have become a model of
intelligent brand-name positioning in New York's crowded arts
market.
</P>
<P>
   By now, BAM's aura can seem all-powerful: the Lincoln Center
Festival staff was bemused by the occasional letter complaining
that its ticket prices were so much higher than BAM's, when in fact
they were almost precisely equivalent in every category. So much
for the feeble power of reality compared with carefully crafted
image!
</P>
<P>
   Lichtenstein's very dogged loyalty to a core group of artists,
mostly of his generation or a decade or two younger, may be as much
about marketing as art. To names like the locals listed above, one
must add Peter Brook (who had an entire BAM theater, the Majestic,
retrofitted in his honor), Ingmar Bergman, Pina Bausch, the Kronos
Quartet, Peter Sellars, Robert Lepage, Zingaro and Christie.
</P>
<P>
   Lichtenstein needs at least some of the mainstream to fill his
900-seat Majestic Theater and 2,100-seat Opera House, let alone
such venues as the Park Slope Armory he used for Ariane
Mnouchkine's ``Atrides'' or the Battery Park big top for Zingaro.
And mainstream audiences _ maybe any audience _ need to be
comforted as well as challenged.
</P>
<P>
   Potential BAM ticket buyers may want to encounter the hip and to
be hip. But they are more likely to buy a Next Wave or BAM Opera
series if they recognize a few names. Brook, Wilson and Morris are
Lichtenstein's Bach, Beethoven and Brahms. The downside is that
such repetition cuts into BAM's innovativeness, in the sense that
these by-now familiar names crowd out newcomers who might offer New
York audiences something truly unknown and unexpected. But the
reiteration of the familiar has made BAM's innovation possible.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Let us not overdo the notion that Lichtenstein exploited the
ground-breaking work of others and has beyond reason hammered home
the familiar. He should be admired because along with his
survivalist shrewdness, he is also a brave risk-taker. Not only did
he re-create and sustain BAM for more than three decades; he
constantly sought new work and new directions for an institution
that at most any point might have seemed to be working pretty well
already.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, his bold leaps got him into trouble, as in the twice
ill-fated BAM Theater Company or the BAM Opera Company, chopped off
in an abrupt and slightly messy manner. BAM's effort to connect
with the surrounding black community and to redevelop its immediate
surroundings awaits full realization.
</P>
<P>
   Lichtenstein's endeavor to redefine the Brooklyn Philharmonic
from a mostly stodgy outer-borough orchestra (despite the
intermittent good work of Lukas Foss et al.) into a model
classical-music institution for the next millennium has so far
stumbled, at least at the box office; perhaps that reflects the
fact that Lichtenstein's tastes run stronger and truer in dance and
theater than in music.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, we have his decision to gut two longstanding
venues, the Leper Space, which was a ballroom and is now a cafe,
and the Carey Playhouse, which is to reopen next month as an
art-film quadriplex.
</P>
<P>
   One sees the positives: Lichtenstein wants to turn BAM into a
European-style arts center, with younger film audiences spilling
into the performing arts, and everyone exchanging ideas and
enthusiasms in the cafe. But the cost in innovative flexibility is
steep, and one hopes that the neighborhood redevelopment plans can
include a new, mid-sized performance space located, say, between
BAM proper and the Majestic.
</P>
<P>
   There are also inevitable questions about the future. Will Ms.
Hopkins and Mellilo, individually and in consort, come close to
matching Harvey's charisma, and if they don't, will it matter? Do
they have the depth of talent and skill to steer BAM into the
future, reinventing as Lichtenstein has done all along? Will the
model of dual leaders, each reporting directly to the board, work
in the long run?
</P>
<P>
   All unanswerable questions. At this point, and for the rest of
this season, it is time to celebrate Lichtenstein and his
extraordinary tenure at BAM. Beyond all the achievements mentioned
thus far, one should add tenacity. It's hard being an arts
administrator, at least if you care as passionately about the arts
as Lichtenstein so evidently does.
</P>
<P>
   To see brilliant work poorly attended hurts. Uncomprehending
reviews hurt. Compromises hurt. ``Opportunity is the enemy of
commitment,'' Jerry Brown once intoned, quoting one of his Jesuit
teachers. To New York's great good fortune, Mr. Lichtenstein made
BAM his life's work. He stayed the course, through all the
disappointments, and overcame them.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Harvey Lichtenstein our premier performing arts
administrator _ more important than all his worthy competitors, I
would argue, since his influence has extended so far beyond
Brooklyn, New York and America _ is that he changed the way we
think. And he did it through his overwhelming love for what he
does, and for the artists he has given us.
</P>
<P>
   I remember, time and again, Harvey standing at the back of the
center aisle of the BAM Opera House, his face beaming with
childlike pleasure. The pleasure is in the artists' work, not in
his pride in presenting it. Not for him the jaded routine, not for
him _ for all his success in translating personal passion into
institutional policy _ the cynical calculation of box-office appeal
over artistic worth.
</P>
<P>
   And when the show is over, even if some of us think it maybe
isn't so hot that night, there is Harvey clapping and cheering like
a fan. He is a fan, and it is the pureness and passion of his
enthusiasm that has defined his accomplishment.

<P>
   And those Republicans who, like Livingston, reviled the process,
still defended it. He said that this Congress was finishing ahead
of the time finished by 10 of the last 15 sessions of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich went beyond his previous approach of trying to sell the
bill on the basis of its smaller parts, such as the banning of
needle-exchange programs in the District of Columbia. Instead, he
belittled the conservatives as obstructionists who were unrealistic
in their demands.
</P>
<P>
   In defending the provision in the final bill for more than $9
billion in money for defense projects, he invoked Ronald Reagan, a
near-sainted figure to conservatives. ``Ronald Reagan said that
protecting our young men and women in uniform was more important
than the deficit,'' Gingrich declared.
</P>
<P>
   The final vote showed that moderate Republicans and Democrats
were the ones most pleased with the bill, although a handful of
moderates, such as Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., opposed it as a
budget-buster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moderates have really come into their own, and this
package reflects it,'' said a beaming Rep. Sherwood Boehlert,
R-N.Y. ``We've ended up on the center ground,'' he said, citing
funding for education programs, home-heating fuel for low-income
Americans, summer jobs for disadvantaged students, full financing
for the International Monetary Fund and more money for Amtrak, a
priority for members from the Northeast, who tend to be more
moderate than those from other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., laughed at his colleagues who
complained about not being given a chance to read the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been massaging this bill for the last two weeks,''
said Goss, chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence, an
area of the budget that received a substantial increase. ``Where
two or three people have gathered together, this bill has been
crafted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the final compromise was forced by a sensible desire by
Republicans to avoid a government shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   But the vote revealed a severe split in the Republican Party
that may be hard to patch up. Conservatives were hinting of future
storms over this budget. ``There's going to be an accounting for
this process,'' said Rep. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma.

 &HT;    FSU defensive line worries Tech
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Florida State always seems to have what separates the
good from the great in college football: top-notch defensive
linemen.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida State defensive line has become a breeding ground
for NFL linemen, and this year is no different, leaving the Georgia
Tech a monumental task this Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   An offense that has scored only three points in its last two
meetings with Florida State has got to figure out a way to find
some air against a team that keeps plugging in outstanding
defensive linemen.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest vacancy this year was left by end Andre Wadsworth,
the third overall pick in the 1998 NFL draft and the highest pick
in FSU history.
</P>
<P>
   The year before, ends Reinard Wilson and Peter Boulware were
drafted in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   This year's crew is led by defensive ends Tony Bryant and Roland
Seymour and defensive tackles Jerry Johnson and Corey Simon, the
player who signed with Georgia in 1995 before an NCAA investigation
into his recruitment had him changing his plans. Remember the
names. Chances are you'll hear them again on an NFL draft day.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all great athletes,'' Georgia Tech center Craig Page
said. ``Not necessarily bigger guys. But they all play extremely
low and come off the ball harder than any team that we face.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the Seminole defensive linemen have been
considered ferocious. They have a reputation for feasting on
quarterbacks, talking some trash and taking late shots at
quarterbacks. But nobody denies their results.
</P>
<P>
   This game is not for the meek, and Tech quarterback Joe Hamilton
knows it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's the kind of game, if you're scared to get
hit, that you'd want to be in,'' Hamilton said. ``They put their
hands down and come straight up the field. They'll do anything to
get to the quarterback. They have a lot of speed throughout the
defensive line. I've got to stay poised back in the pocket. If the
rush comes, I've got to hang in there. If I've got to take a lick
for a completion, I've got to do that. If I've got to take off and
run, I've got to pick my times where I do that, also.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton knows one way Tech can hold off the rush is by
establishing the run, with draw plays or quick screens. Virginia
did a good job of stuffing Tech's running game, holding the Yellow
Jackets to a season-low 83 yards. The Yellow Jackets are not
fooling themselves into thinking any of it will be easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can line up and slug it down the field,''
Tech coach George O'Leary said. ``You need to come up with some big
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton was one in a line of six starting quarterbacks Florida
State knocked out of games last year. He was sacked five times in
the 38-0 loss and hit 11 times. He was able to complete only nine
of 18 passes, and he was intercepted once.
</P>
<P>
   He had his roughest game of this season last week against
Virginia when a hit by two defenders sent him out of the game for a
while with a sprained knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've watched film (of the Virginia game) and are probably
licking their lips a little bit,'' guard Jason Burks said. ``We've
got to have a great effort and make a pact Joe's not going to get
hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Burks said what impresses him most about the FSU defensive line
is when he's seen a defensive tackle chasing a running back
downfield. And actually keeping up. Tech will have to figure a way
to neutralize that speed and do it a week after illegal procedures
and a physical Cavalier defensive front kept the Yellow Jackets
front from controlling the line consistently.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't come close to playing our best game,'' Page said.
``Hopefully, it'll come this week.''

ADS DESIGNED TO REASSURE BLOOD RECIPIENTS CAUSE FEAR INSTEAD  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER STEINHAUER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The newspaper advertisements were supposed to
underscore assurances that anyone who had a blood transfusion in
the early part of the decade need not worry about having contracted
an infectious disease. But the ads, which were placed by the New
York Blood Center, may have had the opposite effect, since they
caused a flood of calls from frightened blood recipients.
</P>
<P>
   The language of the advertisements, which appeared Tuesday in
nine daily newspapers in the New York City region, was portentous.
</P>
<P>
   Under a large headline, ``To all who received blood from January
1991 to December 1996 in a New York/New Jersey hospital,'' they
warned that ``there may have been a problem'' with the viral
infections tests done during that period by the center, which
provides about 80 percent of the blood used in New York City
hospitals. As a result, blood recipients ``may face a potential
risk of transfusion-transmitted infections, such as HIV and
hepatitis,'' the advertisements said. Anyone concerned was
encouraged to call (800) 688-0900 to arrange for free testing.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the center's executives said, the advertisements were
intended to reassure anyone with lingering fears stemming from a
scandal at the center a year and a half ago, in which two employees
were convicted and sentenced on charges of tampering with blood
screening tests, creating false records and conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Although that tampering has not been found to have caused any
diseases, the center executives said, they wanted to offer another
check to anyone who received the blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been doing intensive, sophisticated technical
analysis, and to date, we have been unable to identify persons who
were harmed,'' Dr. Robert Jones, president of the center, said.
``But as part of our commitment to the safety of blood supply and
public health, we should go back out again to make sure people who
have concerns have every opportunity to have it tested at our
costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones conceded that the advertisement might have been worded in
a way that caused more fear than assurance. ``A message like this
can engender some emotional response,'' he said. ``But if we were
to have a very bland message where there was no concern at all,
then people might not pay any attention to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Jones said that the State Health Department and the
Federal Food and Drug Administration had helped draft the
advertisements, officials at both agencies said the center had
placed the ads on its own and simply informed them that it was
doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, after the scandal left some chance that hospitals had
received improperly screened blood, 4,800 pints were recalled. In
addition, the president of the center, Dr. John Adamson, resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Jones also said the advertisement had been timed roughly with an
FDA announcement that thousands of people would be notified that
they might have caught hepatitis C from transfusions before blood
purity testing began in 1992. An added benefit, he added, would be
the chance to ask callers for donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt if we were to have our announcements at the same time,
there would be increased public awareness,'' he said. The strategy
seemed to work. At the center Tuesday, eight operators were kept
busy with hundreds of calls from people who had seen the
advertisement. ``We are pretty maxed out,'' he said. ``But the
message is not to panic.''

   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat were reportedly within reach of a deal that would
call for Israeli troops to withdraw in phases from an additional 13
percent of the occupied West Bank and turn over authority for the
relinquished territory to Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement would eventually leave the Palestinians with
effective control over some 40 percent of the long-contested land.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the Palestinians would agree to implement a set of
U.S.-brokered security guarantees aimed at combatting anti-Israeli
terrorism -- like the grenade attack that left 64 Israelis injured
in the southern city of Beersheba on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu has insisted that Palestinians agree to take a number
of steps targeting terrorism, including the confiscation of illegal
firearms, close cooperation between Palestinian and Israeli
security officials and the arrest and, in some cases, extradition,
of suspected terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin suggested that an
Israeli troop withdrawal would, under the U.S. plan, be carried out
in steps, contingent upon actual performance of Palestinian
security commitments.
</P>
<P>
   ''The initiative was designed to create a parallel process,''
Rubin said. ''As greater and greater security is provided and
implemented, greater and greater amounts of land will
</P>
<P>
   be turned over.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said the talks had entered the ''end game,'' but he
declined to speculate on whether an agreement appeared imminent. A
White House official, speaking on background, left open the
possibility that negotiations could extend into a seventh day on
Wednesday, adding that Clinton has blocked out time to continue
with the summit as needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're into a phase of very hard bargaining,'' Rubin told
reporters gathered at the secluded Wye River Plantation Conference
Center, on Maryland's Eastern Shore, where the Israeli-Palestinian
summit has been underway since last Thursday. ''Some obstacles have
been overcome, but significant gaps remain.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin was decidedly more upbeat, however, than on Monday, when
the terrorist attack in Israel threatened to scuttle the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''That did throw a wrench in the works,'' Rubin said, adding
that talks were moving ahead on multiple fronts on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are rushing around and trying to come up with bridging
ideas and ways to resolve existing problems,'' Rubin said, ''rather
than rebutting talking points.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said there was no hard deadline being imposed on the
talks, but he said the time for putting off difficult decisions had
passed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This cannot go on indefinitely,'' Rubin said, ''but we're
taking it one day at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who scratched a two-day campaign fund-raising trip to
California to remain engaged in the Wye talks, journeyed to the
isolated setting Tuesday afternoon for the fifth time in six days.
</P>
<P>
   There he was joined by Hussein, one of the most enduring figures
in the Mideast. The ailing monarch was called in by U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright to help Clinton try to salvage the
talks in the wake of Monday's attack.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein, who is suffering from cancer and has been undergoing
treatment at the prestigious Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., has
been a central figure throughout a generation of hostilities and
peace overtures between Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   He has worked closely with the Clinton administration on the
issue since the Oslo accords set in motion the current peace
process in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ''King Hussein is a person with great integrity, who has
enormous support amongst many different peoples in the Middle
East,'' Rubin said. ''I do expect him to be a key player in this
drama.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, in an unusually blunt moment, the ailing Hussein
expressed open frustration with Netanyahu's government, blaming him
in a letter for bringing the Oslo process to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   The process was essentially stalled for a 19-month period that
ended in late September, when Clinton brought Arafat and the
Israeli leader together for a brief Oval Office meeting that
resulted in the Wye summit.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 2 million of the world's 6 million Palestinians reside
in Jordan, which is sandwiched between Iraq and Israel. Jordan
would be greatly affected by the direction that any peace accord
might take between Israelis and Palestinians.

JUDGES SEEM SYMPATHETIC TO PAULA JONES' APPEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CLINTON-IMPEACH) 
(nk) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. _ Lawyers for President Clinton and Paula Jones
clashed Tuesday before a panel of federal appeals court judges over
her attempt to reinstate her sexual harassment lawsuit, and the
judges seemed clearly sympathetic to her argument that the case was
wrongly dismissed last April.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones' lawyers implored the three-judge panel of the 8th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to allow a jury to hear her claim
that Clinton is a habitual sexual predator who crudely
propositioned her in 1991. While the lawyers offered a variety of
arguments, the issue they pressed most forcefully was the
president's admission that he misled them about having engaged in a
sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   James Fisher, a Dallas attorney representing Ms. Jones, told the
judges that Clinton repeatedly ``split hairs, dodged questions and
lied'' in the January 17 deposition when he was asked about his
relationship with the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``This court needs to send a message to Washington that the
civil justice system will not countenance perjury, obstruction of
justice or subornation of perjury,'' he said. It was Clinton's
misleading if not untruthful responses in the Jones deposition last
January that led independent counsel Kenneth Starr to send a report
to Congress that the president may have committed impeachable
offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers countered that testimony about Ms. Lewinsky
was not relevant to the case and that, even if Ms. Jones' account
was true, U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright in Little Rock,
Ark., was correct to throw out the case because the allegations did
not amount to sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   At least two of the three judges seemed by their comments and
questions during the hour-long arguments to be leaning towards Ms.
Jones' contention that a jury, not the judge, should decide whether
what happened to her constituted sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   One of the two judges, Pasco M. Bowman, the chief of the panel,
was openly dismissive of suggestions that the conduct of which
Clinton is accused _ inviting Ms. Jones to a hotel suite in Little
Rock in 1991 and making a crude sexual request _ could not amount
to legal sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Bowman did not even ask any questions of Fisher, who held forth
for the first half hour, and only began asking challenging
questions when Amy Sabrin, Clinton's lawyer, began her
presentation.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court and lower federal courts have been wrestling
in recent years with what degree of offensive behavior rises to the
level of sexual harassment, and Ms. Sabrin sought to portray Ms.
Jones' charges as falling far short of those standards.
</P>
<P>
   She said that Ms. Jones suffered no harm at her workplace,
suffered no psychological symptoms from the alleged encounter and
her contact with Clinton in the hotel room and on two other
occasions amounted to only about 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``How bad is bad enough,'' Bowman asked at one point. He said
that recent court decisions seemed to recognize that even one
incident might be severe enough to be deemed sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sabrin seemed to have little success arguing that Wright was
correct in ruling that testimony about Ms. Lewinsky was not
material to Ms. Jones' case. Bowman said that if the appeals panel
reinstated the case, evidence about Clinton's liaison with Ms.
Lewinsky should serve to establish a pattern and practice on
Clinton's part.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Donald R. Ross asked Fisher why the Lewinsky matter was
relevant if it involved consensual sex. Fisher said Ms. Jones was
entitled to use the Lewinsky issue to demonstrate that Clinton
rewarded subordinate women in the workplace with opportunities and
punished those who refused to comply.
</P>
<P>
   Miles W. Lord, who retired as the chief judge of the 8th Circuit
in 1985 and who had been appointed by President John F. Kennedy,
sat through Tuesday's argument and said afterward that he believed
it did not go well for Clinton. ``These fellows are all pretty
strong conservatives and it clearly showed through,'' he said in an
interview. Ross seemed a bit sympathetic to the president, he said,
but on balance still seemed inclined to send Ms. Jones' case to a
jury.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones canceled plans to appear in the courtroom Tuesday
because, her lawyers said, she could not obtain baby sitting help
to come from her home in California. Clinton was not expected to
appear but a small folding chair with a tag reserving the chair for
``William Jefferson Clinton'' was set up in the well of the
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have been in intense negotiations in the last few
weeks to settle the case that has brought Clinton to the brink of
impeachment. The talks broke down over the weekend when Ms. Jones'
camp of competing sets of lawyers, would-be benefactors and
informal advisers fell to bickering over how much money she should
get to withdraw the lawsuit. The White House swiftly rejected her
final demand that Clinton pay her $1 million as part of a $2
million settlement package.
</P>
<P>
   It is unusual for a party to try and settle a case it has
already won, but White House officials have said that they are
expecting the appeals court to reinstate the case. More
importantly, Clinton and his advisers have decided that eliminating
the Jones case from the political landscape will help them in
dealing with Congress over impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bennett, Clinton's principal attorney in the Jones
lawsuit, was present Tuesday but did not argue the case. When
Clinton swore he had not engaged in sexual relations with Ms.
Lewinsky during the January deposition, Bennett reinforced the
denial. Bennett has since written to Wright saying he, too, was
misled by the president, and his withdrawal from Tuesday's argument
was widely seen as an effort to avoid questioning about that from
the judges.
</P>
<P>
   He later told reporters that the last settlement offer from the
Jones camp was unacceptable both because the $1 million demand was
too high and because the other $1 million was to come from Abe
Hirschfeld, a New York-based real estate magnate. Hirschfeld has
said he wants to provide the money to help end what he has
described as a silly lawsuit, but White House officials are wary of
his involvement. It is unclear, they said, whether his contribution
would be a donation to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said he still hoped that a settlement could be achieved
in coming days, a sentiment echoed a few minutes later before the
same group of reporters by Donovan J. Campbell, one of Ms. Jones'
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones has her own powerful reasons for achieving a
settlement. Even if she were to have her case reinstated and go on
to win at trial, there is no guarantee she would win damages
anywhere near the $700,000 the president has offered.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The three judges on the panel hearing Tuesday's argument, all
appointees of Republican presidents and regarded as judicial
conservatives, have ruled against Clinton in the past on other
matters in the Jones case. Bowman and Judge Arlen C. Beam, who also
seemed sympathetic to Ms. Jones, were appointed by President
Reagan; Ross was appointed by President Richard M. Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they have in recent months become more open to
allowing sexual harassment cases to go to a jury.
</P>
<P>
   In July, for example, a separate three-judge panel that was also
headed by Bowman, ruled that a female worker at United Parcel
Service in Little Rock could bring her case to trial. In that case,
a lower court judge had thrown out the complaint on summary
judgment, as did Wright in Ms. Jones' case. The 8th Circuit judges
said they were making the ruling even though they believed the case
was borderline, because a supervisor did nothing more than pat the
woman on the back, brush up against her and tell her she smelled
nice.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Israeli and Palestinian leaders were nearing
agreement on a complicated land-for-peace accord late Tuesday, as
President Clinton and Jordan's King Hussein worked into the night
to try to nurse six days of intensive summitry toward a fruitful
finish.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat were reportedly within reach of a deal that would
call for Israeli troops to withdraw in phases from an additional 13

BACK IN REDMOND, MICROSOFT'S PROFIT MACHINE KEEPS HUMMING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Wash., N.Y.)   (af)  
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Demonstrating yet again the power of its franchise, the
Microsoft Corp. Tuesday reported that its quarterly earnings had
risen 58 percent over their level a year earlier, far exceeding
Wall Street estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, the world's leading maker of computer software, said
demand for the Windows 98 operating system exceeded its
projections, particularly in Japan and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's improved performance coincided with the beginning
stages of a landmark antitrust trial in Washington that could
threaten its dominance in computer software.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which the Department of Justice has portrayed as a
ruthless and unfair competitor, said its strength in the latest
quarter was derived mostly from Windows 98, which was released just
last June, and the Windows NT corporate operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The results for Microsoft, which is based in Redmond, Wash.,
were released after the stock market had closed. In NASDAQ trading,
Microsoft shares closed at $100.25, down $2.69, which may have
reflected the opening of the antitrust trial on Monday. But in
after-hours trading, the shares traded as high as $103.75.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business is good, so the doom-and-gloom scenario of some
economic prognosticators certainly hasn't come to pass,'' Greg
Maffei, Microsoft's chief financial officer, said in a telephone
interview. ``This is not just for Microsoft, but the whole PC
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the widespread economic problems in much of the world,
Maffei noted, the six largest software companies and eight largest
computer and chip companies that have reported earnings have all
beaten estimates.
</P>
<P>
   While continuing to urge caution about the outlook, as Microsoft
executives do each quarter, Maffei said the company was likely to
do better than expected in the second fiscal quarter as well. He
said he would advise securities analysts to adjust their estimates
upward.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended Sept. 30, Microsoft earned $1.68 billion,
or 62 cents a diluted share, more than twice the $663 million, or
25 cents a share, reported in the comparable period a year ago.
Revenues rose 26 percent, to $3.95 billion from $3.13 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The latest results included a $160 million one-time gain on the
sale of Softimage, while in the comparable quarter last year the
company took a previously announced $296 million write-off related
to the purchase of WebTV Networks Inc. Without these one-time
items, Microsoft's earnings rose to $1.52 billion, or 56 cents a
share, compared to the previous year's $959 million, or 36 cents a
share, to record the 58 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp., which tracks earnings
results, had expected Microsoft to earn 49 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a terrific quarter, a real blowout, a very pleasant
surprise for Microsoft shareholders,'' said Rick Sherlund, an
analyst with Goldman Sachs. Microsoft's results ``benefited from
much higher margins,'' he said. ``We had a combination of better
than expected revenues and lower than expected expenses in the
quarter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maffei said the improved profit margins were partly a seasonal
phenomenon because the company does less hiring during the summer
and the marketing costs associated with the launch of Windows 98
were largely in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Also, service costs are lower for Windows 98 than for Windows
95. ``We had better than expected revenues, and we were at the low
end of our spending,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the antitrust suit brought against Microsoft by the
United States Department of Justice did not affect earnings, Maffei
said, it does have a direct cost in increased legal spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a large cost, but not a material cost,'' he said. ``We
do worry about the continued cost of the DOJ's image blasting.''
</P>
<P>
   Unearned revenue, the portion of sales Microsoft sets aside to
reflect the long-term deployment of many of its products, grew to
$3.13 billion in the quarter, up $245 million from a year ago. Cash
and short-term investments totaled $17.24 billion, compared with
$13.93 billion a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   On a cautionary note, Maffei said fallout from the Asian
economic crisis remains a concern and the company is uncertain
about future performance in Latin American countries. Corporate
spending for computer issues related to the year 2000 may divert
revenues away from some Microsoft products but could benefit
others, he said.

WILD RIDE ON WALL STREET LEAVES INDEXES MIXED AT THE END OF A BUSY
DAY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By KENNETH N. GILPIN

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices went on a wild ride Tuesday, soaring for
most of the session only to retreat in the last hour or so of
trading and end up narrowly mixed.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average gained ground for the fifth
consecutive session, the first time since June it has rallied for
that many days in succession.
</P>
<P>
   The blue-chip index, which at one point during the morning was
up 186 points, closed at 8,505.85, up 39.40 points, or slightly
under one-half of a percent. It is the first time the Dow closed
above 8,500 since Aug. 26. For the year, the 30-stoc index is up
7.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index eked out a gain of
1.54 points, or a little more than 0.1 percent, to 1,063.93. But
the Nasdaq composite index fell 9.54 points, or 0.6 percent, to
1,639.19.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, the S&AMP;P 500 has gained 9.5 percent; the Nasdaq
is up 4.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said business did not seem especially brisk Tuesday, but
trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange was heavy at 954
million shares.
</P>
<P>
   As conditions in the equity markets stabilize, money continues
to flow out of the bond market.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the benchmark 30-year bond fell by more than a
point, and the yield rose 5.07 percent, from 4.97 percent.
Short-term interest rates rose.
</P>
<P>
   While some stock investors apparently had second thoughts late
in the session about the wisdom of holding highly liquid,
well-known stocks, issues of smaller companies were popular all
day.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said they were encouraged by the continued improvement
in small caps, which have been battered so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index, made up of small-company stocks, rose
5.86 points, or 1.66 percent, to 358.31. And the New York Stock
Exchange composite index gained 2.78 points, or 0.5 percent, to
528.28.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is enormous opportunity in small caps if we have
stability here,'' said Michael Clark, head of U.S. stock trading at
Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Clark and others said the market has run too far, too fast, and
may be due for a selloff. And the rise in the Dow has indeed been
dizzying: so far this month, it is up more than 10 percent, its
best monthly showing since January 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks got a big boost early in the day from several big banks,
including Chase Manhattan and Wells Fargo, which reported
third-quarter earnings that were better than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Chase, the nation's second-biggest bank, rose 1 15/16, to 45
5/16 after it said it earned 82 cents a share in the period, 5
cents a share better than the consensus forecast from Wall Street
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo, which is merging with the Norwest Corp., rose 11
116, to 3789 16 after it said earnings rose 20 percent, which also
exceeded expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The results encouraged investors to believe that the worst is
over for the battered financial-services sector and helped to lift
stocks of money center banks and brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup rose 2 9/16, to 45 5/16. J.P. Morgan gained 2{, to
95]. Fueled by reports it might be acquired by Deutsche Bank AG,
Europe's biggest bank, Bankers Trust gained 4], to 59[. And Merrill
Lynch jumped 2 7/16, to 54 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, just over one-third of the companies that make
up the S&AMP;P have reported third-quarter earnings, and the good news
is they have come in as expected, even though the bar was
lowered,'' said Bob Gasser, head of block trading at J.P. Morgan &AMP;
Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the bigger test will come after we are through this
earnings season and people start looking out in the future, trying
to determine when they will trough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   IBM gave investors reason to start thinking about the future.
The computer company reported Tuesday that third-quarter earnings
rose 10 percent, a number that exceeded Wall Street expectations.
</P>
<P>
   But the company gave analysts a cautious reading its prospects,
saying that continued problems in Asia and Latin America and
decreased spending by corporations on high-technology equipment
could crimp profits in the fourth quarter and into 1999.
</P>
<P>
   IBM ended the day at 137~, down 1{. Early in the session, the
stock traded as high as 142 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to have to contend with this sort of earnings
picture for a couple of quarters to come,'' Clark of Credit Suisse
First Boston said. ``We still have battles to fight, because people
are not looking forward.''

 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Responding to a wave of grousing in the nation's
military about President Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky,
military leaders have taken the unusual step of warning officers
and enlisted personnel that they could face punishment for
denouncing the commander-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   There has hardly been a groundswell of public criticism among
the nation's 1.4 million soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines. But
the furor surrounding Kenneth Starr's report to Congress last month
accusing Clinton of impeachable offenses has prompted military
personnel to write a number of public rebukes of the president,
mostly in articles or letters in newspapers and magazines.
</P>
<P>
   The rumblings have raised enough concern at the Pentagon that
military authorities have on at least two occasions in recent weeks
responded by warning that Article 88 of the Uniformed Code of
Military Justice explicitly prohibits officers from speaking
``contemptuous words'' against the president, the secretary of
defense or other civilian leaders of the armed services. Each of
the services has similar rules that apply to enlisted personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The assistant commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. Terrence
Dake, sent an electronic memorandum to all generals in the service
on Oct. 9 urging them to remind Marines of the prohibitions. ``It
is unethical for individuals who wear the uniform of a Marine to
engage in public dialogue on political and legal matters such as
impeachment,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In September, days after Starr's report saturated the news, an
article in the official newspaper at F.E. Warren Air Force Base in
Wyoming delivered a similarly stern reminder. The article, which
officials said the Air Force has since circulated informally to
other bases, warned Air Force personnel that they ``aren't allowed
to discuss the president in the same manner as civilians,'' citing
Article 88.
</P>
<P>
   The wave of public criticisms of Clinton was first reported
Tuesday in the The Los Angeles Times. Dake's memorandum was first
reported in The Washington Times on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the affair has consumed the nation's military
in much the same way it has consumed the nation in general: in
other words, with the same mixture of fascination and revulsion,
derision for Clinton and contempt for the independent prosecutor,
Kenneth Starr, a feeling of outrage and a desire that it would all
just go away.
</P>
<P>
   But within the rigid world of military discipline, the scandal
has a deeper undercurrent, since a series of officers and enlisted
personnel have been punished under the Uniformed Code of Military
Justice for the same behavior Clinton has acknowledged with Ms.
Lewinsky: an extramarital affair with a subordinate in the
workplace.
</P>
<P>
   From the start of his presidency, Clinton has had a strained
relationship with the military, whose members viewed his evasion of
the draft and his policies on matters like gays in the military
with suspicion, if not resentment. Now the scandal that has brought
him to the brink of an impeachment inquiry has revived
long-simmering feelings, held by some in the ranks, that Clinton is
not fit to lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can anyone in the military defend President Clinton?''
Master Sgt. Stephen Kapp, stationed at Misawa Air Base in Japan,
wrote in a letter to the editor of Air Force Times, published on
Sept. 28. He went on to call for Clinton's resignation, saying,
``This president has made a mockery out of our country.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Recent retirees, freed from the restraints of the Uniform Code,
have been more vociferous. One, Col. John Baer of the Army, wrote a
letter to The Army Times saying he had torn up a certificate of
appreciation signed by Clinton and mailed it back to the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   A much more prominent retiree, Colin Powell, the Army general
who served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under President
Bush, has in recent weeks been pointed in his disappointment. Asked
for his views at an impromptu news conference at the airport in
Modesto, Calif., on Monday evening, Powell said that Clinton's
behavior was ``a disgrace to the presidency and the Oval Office.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutions under Article 88 are extremely rare. More often
than not, commanders handle violations with administrative
punishment or simply a warning to knock it off, as happened a few
weeks ago at Fort Bragg in North Carolina when joking at a morning
workout veered close to ridicule of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, shortly after Clinton took office, a senior Air Force
officer, Maj. Gen. Harold Campbell, was forced to retire and fined
$7,000 after he described the president as a ``dope-smoking,''
``skirt-chasing'' and ``draft-dodging'' commander in chief at a
NATO banquet.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the threat of punishment under Article 88 has kept a
lid on criticism of Clinton's presidency, but not entirely.
</P>
<P>
   In an article published in Navy Times on Oct. 12, Maj. Shane
Sellers of the Marine Corps called the president ``an adulterous
liar.'' Sellers, an intelligence officer assigned to the Defense
Intelligence Agency, lamented that Clinton was not held to the same
standard as uniformed officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about sex,'' Sellers, a 20-year veteran, wrote.
``It's tawdry and titillating, to be sure. But for all its
soap-opera quality, what Clinton and Monica did as consenting
adults boils down to adultery. And one should call an adulterous
liar exactly what he is _ a criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   His remarks were published three days after Dake's warning.
Although it seems his article was written before the memorandum,
the Marine Corps has begun an investigation into whether Sellers'
remarks crossed the line into ``contemptuous words.'' A spokesman,
Col. Stu Wagner, said Tuesday that Sellers could face punishment
for his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   In the same edition of The Navy Times, Staff Sgt. C.T. Taylor, a
Marine based in Virginia Beach, Va., also questioned the
president's fitness to lead, saying he should resign. ``Is it too
much to expect our president to be the last bastion of morality in
a society where morality and values are ever declining?'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Marines have not yet opened an investigation into
his remarks or any others that could fall under Article 88. The
Army, Navy and Air Force are not currently investigating any
violations, according to spokesmen for each.
</P>
<P>
   The White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said Tuesday that the
president did not believe that the scandal had affected the morale
of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president has enormous respect for the men and
women in uniform in this country,'' Lockhart said, ``and I think
that respect is reciprocated.''

MICROSOFT LAWYER SAYS US CASE BASED ON ``CRAZY QUILT OF EMAIL''
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft Corp. Tuesday branded the government's
antitrust case against it as a ``fundamentally misconceived
attack'' on free markets and on consumers, and said Justice
Department lawyers had unfairly tried to paint the software giant
as a ``great Satan'' and demonize its chairman, Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not really an antitrust case, but a return of the
Luddites _ the 19th Century reactionaries who, fearful of
competition, went around smashing machines with sledgehammers to
arrest the march of progress,'' said Microsoft's lead attorney,
John Warden, as the company opened its defense to antitrust charges
in federal district court.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 20 states accuse Microsoft of
illegally using its monopoly hold on the market for computer
operating systems _ in which Microsoft's Windows software claims 90
percent market share _ to crush potential Windows competitors and
to bully its way into new markets. Monopolies are not illegal, but
their owners may not use their power to crush potential competitors
to the monopoly or to push into new lines of business.
</P>
<P>
   Warden said the government's case was built on ``a crazy quilt
of e-mail fragments'' and ``deposition excerpts that are taken out
of context.'' In cross-examining the first witness in the trial,
Jim Barksdale, chief executive of Netscape Communications Corp., he
suggested that Netscape incited the government lawsuit as a mere
business ploy.
</P>
<P>
   Warden's comments came on Day Two of what is considered the most
significant antitrust case in 15 years, and potentially one of the
most important ever. Rivals to Microsoft say a loss by the
government would give the Redmond, Wash.-based company leeway to
muscle its way unfairly into on-line banking, Internet commerce and
other new businesses. Allies of Microsoft say a government victory
would signal a new era of meddling in the market by antitrust
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The government claims that Gates, Microsoft's billionaire
chairman, feared that his lucrative Windows monopoly could be
undermined by the rise of two rival products: Netscape's Navigator,
a type of ``browser'' software used to view material on the
Internet, and Sun Microsystem's Java software, which brings
information to users over the Internet whether their computers are
powered by Windows or by another operating system.
</P>
<P>
   According to the government, Microsoft feared that Navigator and
Java would make it less essential for people to buy Windows-based
computers, as they could link to the Internet with computers
powered by software from Microsoft's rivals.
</P>
<P>
   In his opening statement Monday, David Boies, the lead
government lawyer, said Gates' first response to this threat was to
approach Netscape in a June 1995 meeting with an offer to divide
the browser market, with Microsoft making browsers for all newer
IBM-compatible computers. If true, that would likely represent
illegal collusion by the two companies.
</P>
<P>
   When Netscape refused to cooperate, the government said,
Microsoft began a three-pronged campaign to damage Netscape.
According to the government:
</P>
<P>
   _Microsoft offered its own browser for free, a form of predatory
pricing designed to force Netscape to stop charging for its browser
and deprive Netscape of a key revenue source.
</P>
<P>
   _Microsoft tried to persuade other companies to abandon their
support and distribution deals with Netscape, using access to
Microsoft Windows as leverage. Without the right to sell Windows,
most computer makers cannot appeal to customers. Software firms
need access to the upcoming versions of Windows in order to make
and sell their own products. Microsoft illegally used the monopoly
power of Windows to turn Netscape's business partners against it,
the government said.
</P>
<P>
   _Microsoft ``tied'' its own browser, called Internet Explorer,
into Windows, so that anyone buying a new computer had an
inducement to use Microsoft's browser and found it more difficult
to use Netscape's browser.
</P>
<P>
   Warden attacked each of these arguments in his opening statment.
</P>
<P>
   Building a browser into Windows allows people to use the same
program to view information, whether it is on the user's own
computer or on the Internet, Warden said. Microsoft engineers
wanted Windows to have this easy-to-use feature even before
Netscape existed, Warden said. Tying the browser to Windows was
aimed at improving Windows, not damaging Netscape, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Warden suggested while cross-examining Netscape chief
Barksdale, Netscape itself has tied new features to its browser,
such as an e-mail program.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's contracts with computer makers and other business
partners were ``not only completely unobjectionable, but
pro-competitive,'' Warden said. The contracts did not choke off
Netscape's distribution channels, he said, as Netscape has plans
under way to distribute more than 100 million copies of its
browser.
</P>
<P>
   Warden also described the notion that Microsoft tried to divide
the browser market with Netscape as ``fantastical.'' He suggested
that Netscape mischaracterized the June 1995 meeting to the Justice
Department as a ``means of enlisting the government as Netscape's
protector.'' In reality, the meeting was a normal conversation
between two companies about how to serve customers better, Warden
said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also objected to suggestions on Monday by Boies, the
Justice Department's lawyer, that Gates misled the government in
videotaped depositions earlier this year. ``A personal attack on a
man whose vision and innovation have been at the core of the
benefits that people are reaping from the Information Age is no
substitute for proof of anti-competitive conduct,'' Warden said.
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale is scheduled to return to the stand Wednesday.

JUDGE THREATENS TO HALT BIOWEAPONS TRIAL IN LIEU OF UNDISCLOSED
EVIDENCE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JAMES PINKERTON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROWNSVILLE _ A federal judge threatened Tuesday to halt the
trial of three men accused of sending death threats to President
Clinton after federal prosecutors failed to disclose investigative
information to defense attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, I want the information ... and I want it
produced immediately, as quickly as humanly possible,'' U.S.
District Judge Hilda Tagle told assistant U.S. Attorney Mervyn
Mosbacker. ``I'm very unhappy with this.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Oliver Dean Emigh, 63, Jack Abbott Grebe, 43, and Johnie Wise,
72, are being tried on charges of conspiracy and threatening to use
weapons of mass destruction in an alleged assassination plot.
Prosecutors say the men, members of the separatist group, Republic
of Texas, planned to modify disposable lighters to shoot cactus
needles coated with biological agents, including anthrax and HIV,
into their targets.
</P>
<P>
   No actual biological weapons were found, but the three are
accused of sending threatening e-mail messages to Clinton, U.S.
Attorney General Janet Reno and other officials.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's comments ended the second day of testimony, during
which a 45-minute FBI videotape was played, showing the men on the
evening that the threats were sent from an FBI informant's trailer
home in Harlingen.
</P>
<P>
   On the black and white videotape, two of the defendants, between
sips of homemade wine and talk about car repairs, instructed the
informant, John L. Cain, to send e-mails to President Clinton and
other top-ranking federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``All right, there went Hillary and Billary,'' quips Cain, after
announcing he had sent the threat to the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good deal,'' replies Grebe.
</P>
<P>
   The government indictment in the case says the e-mail messages
threatened: ``Your ... employees and their families have been
targeted for destruction by revenge ... Personal delivery systems
have been developed to inject bacteria and or viruses for the
purposes of killing, maiming or causing great suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   On the videotape, Cain also compliments Wise and Grebe for
targeting agency heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was taught if you're going to fight, pick on the biggest
one,'' Grebe replies. ``That way, you can make an example of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Cain can be heard on the tape asking the men what they
want him to do next, and he asks Wise when a prototype of his
homemade biological weapon, the modified cigarette lighter, would
be ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't done a thing,'' Wise replies. ``I'm just scattered
so thin.''
</P>
<P>
   Wise also can be heard on the videotape saying the first victim
of the biological weapon would be Cameron County Court-at-Law Judge
Migdalia Lopez, who angered Republic of Texas leaders by not
allowing defendants to represent themselves in her court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to find out where she hangs out and when she gets
lunch or coffee,'' Wise can be heard saying.
</P>
<P>
   The Republic of Texas, which is split into several factions,
believes Texas was illegally annexed and is not part of the United
States. Cain has testified that he went to work in February for
local members of the group, and last March was made
``undersecretary of commerce'' at a meeting in Conroe.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys claim it was Cain who orchestrated the alleged
plot and entrapped the others. Cain was paid $16,000 to $18,000 as
an informant for the FBI. The government has not yet presented
evidence on whether the three defendants ever paid Cain to send the
e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   The defense lawyers told jurors on Monday that Cain had a spotty
employment record and had attempted to become a police officer and
a police informant before the biological weapons case developed.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors, who had begun hearing the case on Monday, were excused
early on Tuesday after the judge questioned prosecutors and an FBI
agent about missing computer files that were kept by Cain, who is
the prosecution's star witness.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Dan Herink asked Tagle to declare a mistrial,
arguing that the government's failure to turn over the documents
before trial hampered his ability to defend his client, Grebe. The
judge denied the motion, but demanded that the records be produced
by Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The three men face up to life in prison if they are convicted in
the case. They have been held without bond since their arrests last
July. &QL;

 Wells, Norwest Shareholders OK Merger  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Shareholders for Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. and Minneapolis's Norwest Corp.
approved plans to merge yesterday, creating the nation's
seventh-largest bank.
<P>
   The move sets the stage for swift completion of this year's
second transaction involving a historic San Francisco financial
institution.
</P>
<P>
   Just three weeks ago, BankAmerica Corp., the bank founded in
1904 by A.P. Giannini as Bank of Italy and later to become the
West's dominant financial institution, completed its sale to North
Carolina's NationsBank Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Now the spotlight shifts to Wells Fargo, the bank that opened
for business in 1852 to provide financial and express services in
the Gold Rush era, growing a century and a half later into
BankAmerica's chief rival.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo said 98 percent of its shareholders who cast votes
at a special meeting yesterday approved the proposed merger.
Norwest shareholders also approved the merger, including plans to
issue stock by Norwest to complete the deal and a change in the
name of the financial institution to Wells.
</P>
<P>
   While both banks sold to out-of-state institutions and described
their transactions as ``mergers of equals,'' their experiences
contrast sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Despite adopting the BankAmerica name, NationsBank is treating
its partner like a conquered province, putting its own people in
key positions and closing the bank's San Francisco headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Recent losses in investment and international banking at the old
BofA have marginalized executives of the San Francisco bank,
including former Chief Executive David Coulter, who announced his
resignation yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Norwest is showing a much more even hand. The combined bank's
home office will be in San Francisco, and Wells executives are
getting plumb assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Vice Chairman Rod Jacobs, for example, is getting the crucial
chief financial officer slot at the new bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more balanced distribution of responsibilities is very
noticeable at Wells Fargo,'' said John Wilson, a San Francisco
executive recruiter with Korn/Ferry International. ``That makes a
huge difference in morale.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Wells Fargo's style was much closer to NationsBank's
when it took over downstate rival First Interstate Bancorp two
years ago. The bank fired dozens of senior First Interstate
managers within days of the acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Wells Fargo said its third-quarter profit rose 20
percent from a year ago as income from fees and deposit service
charges jumped.
</P>
<P>
   The bank said it earned $347 million, or $3.99 a diluted share,
compared to $290 million, or $3.23 a share, in the 1997 third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo's revenue, including interest and noninterest
income, rose 4.4 percent, while expenses were virtually unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Loans and deposits, though down from last year, rose slightly
from the end of June, a sign that service problems and customer
defections stemming from the bank's hostile takeover of First
Interstate Bancorp are no longer problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wells Fargo's earnings came in a little better than
expected,'' said Van Kasper &AMP; Co. analyst Joseph Morford. ``They're
characteristic of a regional bank without any exposure to emerging
markets or hedge funds.''

 Battle Over Cybersmut Set to Begin Again  &HT;       
 By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
A coalition of civil liberties groups plans to file a lawsuit this
week challenging a controversial online pornography amendment that
is part of the $500 billion omnibus spending bill.
<P>
   Before the ink dries on President Clinton's expected signature
of the bill, the American Civil Liberties Union, Electronic Privacy
Information Center &UR;  &LR; and Electronic Frontier Foundation will file a
joint lawsuit in federal court in Philadelphia, alleging the bill
stifles the free exchange of ideas and could be interpreted
differently in various jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said the suit will mirror an earlier suit that last year
successfully killed off the Communications Decency Act, Congress'
first attempt to limit cybersmut.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this becomes law, the Starr report would be illegal,'' said
Barry Steinhardt, president of the Electronic Frontier Foundation
in San Francisco. ``The same people who pushed the Starr report are
pushing this legislation. In its haste to make that extremely
graphic report available to millions of people online, Congress may
be the most successful pornographers in the history of the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The sweeping $500 billion appropriations bill is sprinkled with
high-tech-friendly legislation that liberalizes limits on foreign
visas, places a three-year moratorium on new local and state
Internet taxes and extends a research-and-development tax credit
for another year.
</P>
<P>
   However, the pornography amendments are considered a black eye
for the industry amid the flurry of last-minute legislative
victories. They are still opposed by free-speech advocates and
Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   The provisions would impose criminal penalties on commercial Web
sites that allow anyone 17 or under to access pornographic material
deemed ``harmful to minors.'' Violators would face up to $50,000 in
fines and six months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, they mandate that adult-oriented sites require a
credit card or personal ID number to ensure that only adults can
access them; if not, the sites face state and local taxes. Internet
service providers would be required to provide information on
filtering software to block salacious content.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's deja vu all over again,'' said an ACLU spokeswoman.
``We've gone through this before, haven't we?''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the original
Communications Decency Act trampled free-speech rights. That
legislation, ironically, was also added at the 11th hour to a much
larger bill, the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But the new legislation, scornfully called CDA II, ``suffers
from the same constitutional problems as the first CDA,'' said
Chris Hansen, senior staff counsel of the ACLU in New York. ``In
the name of protecting children, it tries to ban speech which is
constitutionally protected for adults.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  In an attempt to narrow the bill in accordance with the
Supreme Court's CDA decision, the new anti-pornography measures
apply only to commercial Web sites instead of the entire Internet
and use a ``harmful-to- minors'' standard instead of a broader
indecency standard.
</P>
<P>
   The ``harmful-to-minors'' standard would allow access to
material that had redeeming social, political or artistic value,
such as Web sites on breast cancer or AIDS awareness. That
standard, its defenders claim, has been upheld in federal and state
courts for decades and is the legal basis for pornography statutes
in 48 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``We read the Supreme Court decision (on the original CDA)
closely and rewrote (the proposed legislation) to apply the
principles of pornography law to the Web,'' said Peggy Peterson,
communications director for Representative Michael Oxley, R-Ohio,
who authored portions of the bill. ``It's not legal for a child to
go into a video store and buy an X-rated film. Those materials are
placed behind a wall or under a table. We're trying to apply that
same standard to the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson scoffed at arguments that the Starr report violates the
new anti-porn bills. She said the government document was released
for noncommercial reasons, did not contain graphic images and ``was
not designed to appeal to prurient interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The civil liberties groups ``complained the CDA was too broad.
Now they're complaining this bill isn't broad enough,'' said Shyla
Welch, communications director at Enough is Enough, a Fairfax, Va.,
nonprofit organization that wants to restrict online pornography.
``Is there anything that will make these people happy? I think we
know the answer.''

JORDAN'S KING HUSSEIN JOINS CLINTON AT MIDEAST TALKS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WYE MILLS, Md. _ Jordan's ailing monarch, King Hussein, a
staunch supporter of the Mideast peace process, joined President
Clinton at a Maryland retreat Tuesday as peace talks stretched into
a sixth day.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated US officials conceded that almost every effort to
solve one sticking point has been met with arguments about other
nettlesome issues. The officials said they will continue Wednesday,
and they hope that some kind of accord can be reached in time for
an upbeat ceremony at the White House by week's end.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that at least some agreements were close to being
signed, those familiar with the negotiations said that lawyers were
revising the exact language of documents being discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're past the atmospherics and down to hard bargaining,''
State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Israel's pressing concerns about security had
pushed other issues to the back burner, Rubin snapped, ``You'd be
surprised how every issue can be on the front burner. The front
burner is full.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the negotiators are pressing ahead with
discussions about a Palestinian airport and seaport, despite the
Israeli view that the talks should focus on preventing terrorism,
catching terrorists and extraditing suspects to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday marked the fifth time in six days that Clinton has flown
out to Wye River conference center. That is an extraordinary
commitment for any president, especially one facing impeachment
hearings and trying to travel around the country and bolster
candidates from his party two weeks before congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   Officials and independent analysts who follow the talks said the
United States is still trying to get essentially the same agreement
that officials were working on a year ago. In exchange for giving
up 13 percent more of the West Bank, Israel would receive
guarantees that Palestinian Authority will deal severely with
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to add muscle to the negotiating team, Clinton's
advisers called on Hussein, who was being treated for cancer in
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the afternoon, Clinton and Hussein held alternate
meetings with Palestinians and Israelis. A joint meeting was
expected in the evening to ``turn what had been a two-way, tag-team
diplomacy perhaps into a little bit more of a three-way, tag-team
diplomacy,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein ``can add his unique perspective to these talks,'' White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart said. Rubin said the king would be a
welcome guest, ``given his charisma, given his special role in the
past, given the extensive, warm feelings people have for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hussein has taken on the role as the region's most eloquent and
impassioned proponent of peace, leaving well in the past conflicts
Jordan had with Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1967, Hussein, joining the Arab front that attacked
Israel, lost control over the West Bank and East Jerusalem, leading
to many of the problems over boundaries that persist Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   And in September 1971, under pressure from the United States and
Israel, he cracked down on Palestinian guerrilla bases operating in
his territory, forcing them to relocate to other Mideast states.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Hussein wrote a widely publicized _ although
supposedly ``private'' _ letter to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu excoriating the Israelis for damaging the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   US officials feel extraordinary pressure for several reasons.
For one thing, everyone fears that another terrorist attack will
destroy the peace process. For another, Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat has threatened to declare an independent Palestinian state
if negotiations are not over by next May 4, a target date for the
end of the peace talks that was set during negotiations in Oslo,
Norway, in 1993.

 Healtheon Pulls Its IPO _ Cites Market Turmoil  &HT;       
 By Dan Fost 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Deciding it did not have the cure for the stock market's latest
headaches and heartburn, Healtheon Corp. pulled its plans yesterday
for a $51 million initial public offering.
<P>
   The Santa Clara company, which puts health care billing and
other medical transactions on the Internet, said it would wait for
market conditions to improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trading pattern in the stock could be highly volatile, and
that's a risk the board prefers not to take,'' chief executive Mike
Long said in a telephone interview. ``We'll remain a private
company, seek private capital and continue to evaluate the public
markets in 1999 to determine if the right circumstance develops
where we would consider being a public company.''
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon also announced a new, $40 million round of private
funding that will keep the company running into next year. Its
founder and chairman, Jim Clark, who owns almost half the company,
spearheaded the latest round along with existing investors such as
venture firms Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers, and New
Enterprise Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors salivated at the chance to join the latest
venture of Clark, who scored big wins when he co-founded Netscape
Communications Corp. and Silicon Graphics Inc.
</P>
<P>
   As late as October 1, Healtheon had announced that the IPO would
value the company at about $430.1 million. In a filing with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said it would
sell about 6.5 million common shares for between $6 and $8 each.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, however, the stock market was getting jittery as a
global financial crisis spread, President Clinton fell under attack
at home and large hedge funds reported huge losses.
</P>
<P>
   According to the investment firm Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, 75
companies have pulled their IPOs since August and 15 have gone
public in the same time period.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Theglobe.com, a New York Internet company, dropped
the price on its IPO and put off the sale of its stock until today.
Theglobe.com, which runs a Web community with 1.9 million members,
plans to sell 3.1 million shares at $8 to $10 each, down 25 percent
from the planned price of $11 to $13.
</P>
<P>
   Other firms, including NetGrocer, an online supermarket, have
stalled their IPOs. ``There are tons and tons of them,'' said David
Simons, managing director of Digital Video Investments, a New York
institutional research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Even Goldman Sachs, the venerable investment bank, withdrew its
IPO, partly because of its exposure to global turmoil and partly
because of the market's uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   The only firm to deliver a successful IPO in recent weeks was
eBay, a San Jose online auctioneer that went public on September 24
at $18 a share. The stock soared 163 percent to $47.38 that day,
and it closed yesterday at $46.50, up $1.13.
</P>
<P>
   Investors thought eBay might jump-start the IPO market, but that
didn't happen, according to Ken Anderson, the assistant managing
editor of VentureFinance, a newsletter that tracks venture capital
and IPOs.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were hoping that it would open a larger window for
other companies to come out, but (the IPO's success) was based just
on eBay's qualities,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Healtheon's SEC filing acknowledged the company's uncertain
future, including the reluctance of the health care industry to
adopt new high-tech methods of conducting business.
</P>
<P>
   According to the filing, the company brought in revenue last
year of $13.4 million but lost $25.4 million. In the first six
months of this year, revenue grew to $20.7 million but losses also
mounted to $21.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Long, the CEO, wouldn't say when Healtheon expects to turn a
profit.
</P>
<P>
   The company, founded in 1995, employs 470 people, most at its
Santa Clara headquarters. In July, the company acquired Metis, a
privately held firm in San Francisco with a similar business model,
and in February, it bought Actamed, &UR;  &LR; which supplies data networks
for health care firms and has offices in Atlanta and Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Long said the company planned to use the revenue generated in
its public offering to acquire more companies. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``We made the decision to be a public company in the June time
frame, when the public markets were a lot different than they are
now,'' Long said.

 &HT;    Women are finding positive support after mastectomy surgery
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The transformation was immediate.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Motter entered the little shop three years ago feeling
depressed and self-conscious but emerged just one hour later
feeling ``pretty and feminine'' and ``like myself again.''
</P>
<P>
   The Piqua woman underwent a mastectomy in 1995 and remembers
dreading that first shopping trip for a prosthesis and bras.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated to come in and didn't want to show them what had
happened to me,'' she recalled last week while paying her annual
visit to the boutique.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I felt self-conscious about being fitted, but
everyone was so kind and understanding. After I found out that the
lady fitting me had gone through the same thing, it put me at
ease.''
</P>
<P>
   Her positive experience took place at Silhouette's For Women, a
Clayton shop that caters to those who have undergone breast
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The shop, its owners and merchandise reflect a new attitude
toward women in need of post-mastectomy apparel _ breast
prostheses, bra and swimwear.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Cancer Society, an estimated 178,700
new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed among women
in the United States during 1998. Each year more than 7,000 Ohio
women are diagnosed with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   What's changed over the years is both attitude and product
selection. With the disease being diagnosed earlier and with more
effective treatment, more women are surviving and becoming more
vocal and assertive about their needs.
</P>
<P>
   Old horror stories abound. Years ago, post-surgery women stuffed
bras with panty hose, socks or rice. Many recall handing male
pharmacists a prosthesis prescription and their bra size and
receiving a box in exchange with the response: ``Here, this oughta
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some say early prostheses resembled a pink rubber ball or a
large goose egg.
</P>
<P>
   Eileen Tracy, owner of Alberta's A Natural Look in Centerville,
keeps one of the old styles on the shelf at her store, which also
caters to women who've had breast surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see how far we've come,'' she says, holding up the
hard, weighty form.
</P>
<P>
   Those unpleasant, and often traumatic, experiences are mostly
just memories. These days a woman can expect excellence in both
selection and service.
</P>
<P>
   There's a natural-looking _ and feeling _ prosthesis to fit
every type of surgery and every size and shape of woman. The forms,
which run from $250 to $400, come in various skin tones, are made
of a medical-grade silicone and feel amazingly natural.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to improving appearance, a prosthesis helps maintain
weight balance and keeps the shoulder and spine straight after
surgery. It also provides protective padding for the chest.
</P>
<P>
   Companies make soft, fiber-filled forms for the weeks
immediately following surgery, and enhancers for those who have had
lumpectomies. For those who object to added weight, there's a
lighter-weight prosthesis; for swimmers, there are forms to wear in
the water. Nipples can even be added for a natural look under
revealing fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   For active women who want to ensure their prosthesis stays in
place, the newest breast forms attach to the chest with Velcro.
Women change the skin support every couple of weeks and the
prosthesis can be worn with regular bras.
</P>
<P>
   Another innovation: a breast form with a liquid-silicone back
that hugs the chest and provides natural movement. In development
is a form that will adhere to the chest by itself.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies typically cover the cost of a new prosthesis
every two years as well as post-mastectomy bras (known medically as
surgical carriers) each year.
</P>
<P>
   The special bras, which contain a pocket for the breast form,
are cut more conservatively at the cleavage line and fuller at the
arm hole. They come in a variety of pretty styles, including
camisoles. Specially designed bathing suits have also become more
stylish, a sharp contrast to the days when they were known as
``surgical suits.'' Some suits incorporate their own lightweight
breast forms.
</P>
<P>
   Some shops, such as Silhouette's, also stock wigs, hats and
turbans for those who have undergone chemotherapy and hair loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hats are cut deeper in the back at the base of the neck,''
explains owner Brenda Mitchell. ``A baseball hat doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   The thought of a wig didn't throw Sandra Dulaney, 50, after
chemotherapy because she had worked as a professional hairdresser.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hair is very fine and I used the opportunity to change to a
new look with more luxurious and longer hair,'' Dulaney says.
</P>
<P>
   Shopkeepers say most women prefer to select the wig that comes
closest to their own previous style and hair color.
</P>
<P>
   At Silhouette's, synthetic wigs, which remain styled and require
only occasional washing and shaking out, range from $80 to $160.
Human hair wigs, which require regular styling, are $300 to $500.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a woman's cosmetics may need to be reconsidered
during cancer treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many women develop skin sensitivity during chemotherapy and
radiation,'' explains Raye Payne, who coordinates the ``Look Good,
Feel Better'' program for the American Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to advice from cosmetologists, the monthly
get-togethers provide free-and-safe cosmetics from leading
manufacturers to any woman undergoing any type of cancer treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Those in the business agree there's no reason for a woman to be

MICROSOFT LAUNCHES COUNTERATTACK ON GOVERNMENT CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Comparing government lawyers to ``19th century
reactionaries who ... went around smashing machines with
sledgehammers to arrest the march of progress,'' Microsoft Tuesday
launched its counterattack on the government's sweeping anti-trust
case.
</P>
<P>
   In an opening statement and during the cross-examination of a
key government witness, Microsoft lead attorney John Warden argued
that the company has done nothing illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Warden derided various elements of the government's case as
``ridiculous,'' ``fantastical,'' and ``pure unadulterated
nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   He questioned the motivation of government prosecutors,
suggesting they were acting either because of the exigencies of
``electoral politics,'' under the influence of ``academics seeking
new forms of social engineering,'' or because of ``pressure from
Microsoft's competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Warden described the evidence against the company as ``a crazy
quilt of e-mail excerpts,'' some of the government's witnesses as
``ignorant,'' and said ``the government has clearly fallen down a
rabbit hole.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department was underwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft has very good counsel, but they can't change the
law, they can't change the facts, and they really can't change the
subject, and the subject matter is what Microsoft did that was
anti-competitive,'' said Justice Department special trial counsel
David Boies.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft stands accused, by the federal government and the
attorneys general of 20 states and the District of Columbia, of
violating the nation's antitrust laws by seeking to extend a
monopoly on computer operating systems into the market for Internet
browsers.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that ``the anti-trust laws are not a code of civility in
business,'' Warden said that over the course of the trial he will
show that Microsoft has been an aggressive competitor but has not
done anything illegal.
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that Microsoft does not have a monopoly on computer
operating systems, because the market for computers should be
defined to include not just Intel-based personal computers, which
Microsoft dominates, but also work stations, handheld computers,
networked computers, and Apple's Macintosh computers. He said
anyone with brains and venture capital can introduce a new
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft has not denied customer choice,'' Warden said.
``Microsoft is customer choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the government's case centers on Microsoft's alleged
effort to avoid the competitive threat posed by Netscape
Communications Corp., until recently the dominant manufacturer of
Internet browsers. The government alleges that Microsoft illegally
sought to divide the market for browsers with Netscape, and,
failing that, sought to use illegal tactics to destroy Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   But Warden said each of Microsoft's actions regarding Netscape
were simply steps taken to benefit consumers. For example, Warden
said the company's decision to integrate its Internet browser into
the company's ubiquitous operating system was made because
consumers want an operating system with more features.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ordinary consumers who buy personal computers at Wal-Mart have
no interest in piecing together an operating system from a grab bag
of separately marketed components,'' he said. ``They want their new
machine to come out of the box and just work. And Microsoft is
fully entitled to provide those consumers with what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Netscape has rapidly lost market share since Microsoft
integrated its browser into its operating system, Warden cited
statistics showing that Netscape's share of corporate usage has
been rising and that the company continues to distribute millions
of copies of its browser every month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government apparently would have preferred Microsoft to
leave Netscape in an unchallenged position as a potential collector
of monopoly rents,'' Warden said. ``The undisputed victor in the
so-called browsing wars has been the consuming public.''
</P>
<P>
   During his cross-examination of Netscape president Jim
Barksdale, Warden attempted to show that the government is
advocating not for consumers, but for Netscape, in this trial.
(Barksdale was questioned by Microsoft before being questioned by
the government under the unusual rules for this trial, which
provide that witnesses submit their direct testimony in writing and
begin their court appearances by being cross-examined.)
</P>
<P>
   Warden led Barksdale through a series of questions designed to
show that provoking a government lawsuit against Microsoft was part
of Netscape's business plan. He cited an undated Netscape strategy
document offered as evidence by Microsoft that includes the words
``DOJ and court actions create opportunity for Netscape.''
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale acknowledged he had met with Justice Department
officials about six times prior to the government's lawsuit being
filed, including hosting a breakfast at his house for the
government's top antitrust official, Joel Klein. He also said he
had urged the government to file a lawsuit against Microsoft, and
at one point, explaining why he didn't simply sue Microsoft, said,
``we asked our Department of Justice, for whom our tax dollars pay,
to look into them.''
</P>
<P>
   Warden also led Barksdale through a series of questions to show
that Netscape, even when it dominated the market for browsers,
constantly added new features to its product. A Microsoft spokesman
said that line of questioning was intended to illustrate that
Microsoft has done nothing unusual by integrating new features into
the Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale often appeared hostile and showed flashes of anger
under questioning. He insisted that Microsoft has a monopoly on
operating systems, because, he said, ``there is no other operating
system today, practically speaking,'' for retail consumers of
personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   And in one outburst provoked by Warden, Barksdale said Microsoft
has conducted ``a concerted public relations campaign against my
company,'' and listed a series of threatening comments allegedly
made about Netscape by Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates and President
Steve Ballmer.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing offered one new detail. The Justice Department
acknowledged it has been advised by Robert Denham, who until last
year was the chairman and chief executive officer of the investment
bank Salomon Brothers Inc. Denham, now a lawyer in Los Angeles,
could not be reached to discuss his role in the case, but the
Justice Department said he had been hired as a consultant to advise
the government about business issues.

OLYMPIAN MOCEANU SUES TO BE DECLARED AN ADULT, CLAIMS FATHER
SQUANDERED HER MONEY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RON NISSIMOV 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ In 1996, 14-year-old Dominique Moceanu showed an inner
strength that belied her age by refusing to let a stress fracture
keep her from competing in the Olympics Games in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But masked beneath her steely eyes, a different kind of stress
was taking its toll.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure of being driven by her parents to be an Olympic
athlete since she was 3 years old finally got to Moceanu this
weekend. On Monday, at age 17, she filed a lawsuit in state
district court here asking to be declared a legal adult so her
parents would not have control over her _ or her money.
</P>
<P>
   According to the suit, Moceanu's father, Dumitru Moceanu, has
squandered the money she has earned in her professional career,
which started at age 10.
</P>
<P>
   A judge signed a temporary restraining order Monday saying her
parents must stay away from Moceanu _ who ran away from her
parents' north Harris County home on Sunday _ until a hearing is
conducted Nov. 11 on her requested adult status. An ad litem
attorney was appointed by the court to represent her interests.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, Moceanu revealed the problem is about much more
than money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never had a childhood,'' Moceanu said with a touch of
sadness underneath the intense confidence she normally projects
from her five-foot frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to compete when I was young, I always was in fear
because I would get yelled at by my father, and I would say to
myself, `I'm 13 years old, come on,' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of talking to me, they're always yelling with me,
fighting with me,'' Dominique said.
</P>
<P>
   Although such sentiments are probably those of any teen-ager,
she said her life has been far from typical.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always had to be about the gym,'' Moceanu said about her
relationship with her parents. ``I would think, `Don't you guys
know anything besides gymnastics? Can't we go out for ice cream?
Can't you be me my mom and dad instead of me being your business?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have been getting rough for a while, a lot of people
don't know,'' Moceanu said. ``We've been trying to keep things
hidden.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her father has hit her ``a couple of times.''
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu's father, who spent some of Moceanu's earnings opening a
gym last year, declined to comment. Her mother, Camelia Moceanu,
could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu said her parents, who are Romanian immigrants, are very
upset about what has happened.
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu and her lawyer Roy W. Moore, declined to say how much
money she has made and how much they think has been lost. Her
lawsuit said a trust that had been established for her is all but
gone. Moceanu said her father has made some poor investments with
the money, such as buying property that is polluted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kill myself training and going to school, and what is he
doing with my money?'' she said. ``They haven't been working since
1996. Where does their income come from? Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore said her parents have refused to answer his client's
questions about where her money has gone. He said all that she
needs to prove to receive adult status is that she is living away
from her parents and can support herself. Once she has the status,
Moore said, Moceanu will be able to demand through legal channels
to see an accounting of her money.
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu was born in Los Angeles in 1981, and she and her parents
moved to the Houston area in 1990 so she could train with famed
gymnastics coach Bela Karolyi.
</P>
<P>
   She said she has been ``living like a fugitive'' the last couple
of days, moving from house to house to make sure her parents can't
find her.
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu, the only member of the 1996 U.S. gold medal women's
gymnastics team still competing in all gymnastics events, said
being away from her parents will help her focus on her training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been trying to block it out, but with school and
everything I just didn't want this to affect me any more,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she hopes to compete in the world championship games in
China next year and possibly in the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. But
her plans to participate in a competition in Australia in two weeks
may have to be scrapped, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu said she reached her breaking point Saturday after her
father angrily said he would fire her coach, Luminita Miscenco, 26,
whom Moceanu credits with helping turn her career around. In
August, Moceanu became the first non-Russian to win the all-around
competition in the Goodwill Games.
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu said her father brought Miscenco from Romania early this
year so she could teach at his gym, but he became threatened by
Miscenco because she helped Moceanu understand she should be
concerned about her finances, the young gymnast said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Moceanu, she told her father Saturday she would
quit if he fired Miscenco, and he replied, ``Fine, you're just
going to have to quit gymnastics.' ''
</P>
<P>
   She said her father threatened to take actions to have Miscenco
deported to Romania.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her, we're going to stick together, I'm not going to
let you go,'' Moceanu said.
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu said she has been thinking about taking legal action for
some time. She said during a meet in Plano last summer, retired
gymnast Kurt Thomas told her she should think about where her money
is going. She said she called her mother to discuss the matter, and
her father immediately drove to the north Texas city to bring her
back.
</P>
<P>
   Moceanu, a senior at the private Northland Christian School,
said she has only had one chaperoned date in her life and has to
hide from her father when she calls friends on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   She said she has a 9-year-old sister who is also training in
gymnastics, and doesn't want to see her sister have the same
problems.
</P>
<P>
   `` I love my parents,'' Moceanu said. ``I hope that after all
this is over, we'll be closer than ever. That would be my dream.'' &QL;

 &HT;    In major categories, OSU's sacks a sore spot
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Ranked first or second in a majority of Big Ten
statistical categories this season, Ohio State's 10th place ranking
in sacks sticks out like a sore thumb.
</P>
<P>
   Yet OSU coaches and players don't seem too concerned the
Buckeyes have managed just 11 sacks this season, ahead only of
Michigan State's five.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are we rated in pass defense?'' OSU defensive
coordinator Fred Pagac (pronounced Pug-itch) asked when questioned
about OSU's low number of sacks. When someone replied OSU is No. 1
in the Big Ten, Pagac says, ``Oh, well, then I'm not worried about
(sacks).''
</P>
<P>
   OSU head coach John Cooper had a similar reaction. He quickly
pointed out all of the categories where they rank at or near the
top: ``Total offense, first is Ohio State. Rushing offense, Ohio
State. Passing efficiency, Ohio State. Pass offense, Ohio State.
Scoring offense, Ohio State. You all with me?'' he said to
reporters earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   The low number of sacks, it seems, is somewhat of a sore spot
for the country's No. 1 college football team. They'd much rather
talk about their strengths, and there are many. Ohio State is
ranked first or second in 18 of the 27 statistical categories,
including total defense and scoring defense, compiled each week by
the Big Ten. Such dominance makes their low sack ranking all the
more surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hoped we would be certainly in the top half (of the Big
Ten),'' Cooper said, when asked what his expectations were.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper continues to point out, however, OSU does not have the
experienced defensive linemen they've had in recent years in
players like Mike Vrabel and Matt Finkes (1996). ``We're so dang
young up there,'' Cooper said, referring to a starting defensive
line made up of three sophomores (Rodney Bailey, Joe Brown, Brent
Johnson) and freshman Ryan Pickett.
</P>
<P>
   The coach also blames opposing quarterbacks' quick, three-step
drops and opponents' preparation for the blitz as other reasons
OSU's sack total is low.
</P>
<P>
   ``(They) go three steps and get rid of the football, you're not
going to get many sacks,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, several Buckeyes expressed surprise and disappointment at
how well two young quarterbacks, Illinois freshman Kurt Kittner and
Minnesota sophomore Andy Persby, played against them the past two
weeks. Kittner was 19 for 43 for 156 yards with no interceptions
while Persby completed 19 of 42 passes for 213 yards, one touchdown
and one interception. Determined to rattle and pressure them into
numerous interceptions and mistakes, the Buckeyes had to settle for
mostly just containing them.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, OSU's Pagac said he thinks overall his defense has
been playing up to expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've been pressuring the quarterback pretty well,''
Pagac said. ``I haven't been studying the stats. But our results
right now are fairly pleasing. We're making them throw the ball
when we want them to throw the ball.''

 &HT;    Mood at Semicon trade show reflects industry depression
 &HT;    By Omar L. Gallaga
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The mood on the floor of the Semicon Southwest
trade show reflects the depressed state of the semiconductor
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The noise generated by sales people chatting up prospective
customers was noticeably lower this year. Some sales people talked
on phones as they waited for visitors or they wandered over to
other booths to compare notes with other reps.
</P>
<P>
   Even the free candy, 3D glasses and buttons didn't draw as many
people as last year when the trade show burst at the seams with
booths at the Austin Convention Center and Palmer Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many of those interviewed by the American-Statesman on
Tuesday said they are cautiously optimistic that recent profit
surprises and other positive news reported by chip makers are
indications of better times ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The show continues today at the Convention Center with an
exposition from 10 a.m.-6 p.m. as well as workshops and seminars.
It is sponsored by the trade group Semiconductor Equipment and
Materials International.
</P>
<P>
   The products exhibited at the show, Austin's biggest convention,
range from complex machines that can cost $2 million to tiny parts
such as bolts and hose fittings that can cost a couple of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   To an outsider, it looks a little like a mix between Radio Shack
and a plumber's tool box: water filtration tools, hoses, robotic
arms, bright jump suits and silicon wafers all co-exist to create
the fantastically complex range of products and materials that go
into creating semiconductors.
</P>
<P>
   A worldwide slump in prices for computer chips has echoed up and
down the chain of suppliers and chip makers. Companies from
Motorola down to the tiniest equipment makers have cut jobs,
tightened costs and postponed projects.
</P>
<P>
   Those economic conditions were sharply evident on the convention
floor Tuesday. Many exhibitors complained they were getting fewer
leads on customers and receiving fewer visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like about half to me,'' said John Wilczek, an
account manager for Johnson Matthey Electronics, which makes
electronics and materials. The company, based in Minneapolis,
Minn., has 3,000 employees,
</P>
<P>
   Wilczek, who works in the company's Austin operations, said
Johnson Matthey attended the show to keep pushing products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to cut costs as much as we can,'' he said.
``But we've been through these slumps before. You can't stop
working and you can't stop selling.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many exhibitors, Johnson Matthey sent fewer people to
Semicon Southwest than last year. A dozen employees worked the
booth and trade show floor, down from 20 who attended last year.
Leah Castillo, a marketing manager for Electro-Graph of Carlsbad,
Calif., said her company is facing its lowest point in 20 years of
doing business. Last year, the company had 45 employees. After two
rounds of layoffs, Electro-Graph is down to 28 workers.
</P>
<P>
   However, Castillo said old customers are coming out of the
woodwork to place new orders and business is picking up, ``slowly
but surely.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some light at the end of the tunnel,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite fewer sales leads, many attendees agreed that the chip
industry is due for a rebound, possibly within the next six months.
The buzzword on the trade show floor was ``cautious optimism.''
</P>
<P>
   Some said they're waiting for the ``hockey stick effect,'' a
sharp upturn in sales characteristic of the volatile semiconductor
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Those who seemed least fazed by the slowdown or imminent
turnaround at Semicon were businesses that don't deal exclusively
with the semiconductor business.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Davies, a sales manager for Fremont Calif.'s Oxford
Instruments, does research and some low-level manufacturing for
communications and electronics companies. ``Ironically, this year's
been our best,'' Davies said. For others, however, the news isn't
quite so good.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hotovec, a sales representative for Sunx Sensors of West
Des Moines, Iowa, said his sales have sunk over the last six months
and after a banner 1997, he'll be lucky to match previous years
with the leads he collects at Semicon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been terrible,'' Hotovec said. ``I got free tickets to
this show and sent them to 50 of my biggest customers. I haven't
seen any of them.''

   MICROSOFT STRONGLY DEFENDS GATES' BUSINESS TACTICS
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft forcefully defended its chairman, Bill Gates, in
federal court, asserting that the no-holds-barred tactics of his
company are not only common in the computer industry but also good
for the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The opening statement was made in the antitrust lawsuit brought

   U.S. TRADE DEFICIT GREW IN AUGUST
</P>
<P>
   The nation's trade deficit widened by $2.2 billion in August, to

owned Lewis Homes, a leading builder in California and Nevada.
Kaufman already is the largest home builder in California and the

ORGANIZERS BLAME POLICE FOR MELEE FOLLOWING GAY RALLY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN KIFNER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Organizers of a midtown rally to mourn the slaying of
a gay college student in Wyoming charged Tuesday that ``the police
created chaos'' that led to a melee Monday night with sporadic
clashes between the police and demonstrators and scores of arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police refused to negotiate with us. The police refused
even to talk to us,'' said Sara Pursley, one of the organizers of
the demonstration, which did not have a permit. ``And by doing so,
they created far more havoc in the city than we had ever planned to
create.''
</P>
<P>
   The police responded Tuesday that they were forced to make
arrests only after demonstrators spilled out from the sidewalks
into the streets, blocking traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The march, called to protest the killing of Matthew Shepard, 21,
who died on Oct. 12 after being beaten and lashed to a fence like a
scarecrow in what the authorities called a bias-related crime, was
billed as a peaceful ``political funeral,'' organized on short
notice by word of mouth among gays and lesbians, e-mail notices and
flyers distributed in Manhattan's Chelsea, Brooklyn's Park Slope
and other neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   But as some 4,000 protesters gathered around the fountain
outside the Plaza Hotel shortly after 6 p.m., trouble quickly
started. The crowd, too large to be contained on the sidewalks,
tried to march down Fifth Avenue and the police began making
arrests, starting with the parade's negotiators, organizers and
marshals. Disorganized but passionate, the crowd surged south
anyway, at one point becoming trapped between police lines on West
43d Street between Fifth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas,
then charged by police horses.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath, it appeared that both the organizers and the
police were stunned by the size of the turnout and the way that
Shepard's death had galvanized emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were expecting about 500 people when we started putting
this together,'' on the night of Shepard's death, Ms. Pursley said.
``But by the time it rolled around, we realized it was going to be
pretty gigantic.''
</P>
<P>
   The police, for their part, had only about 70 officers assigned
to the demonstration as it began. A Level 1 mobilization, doubling
the police presence with officers from the Manhattan North and
South task forces, was quickly called. A Level 2 mobilization,
drawing in task forces from the other boroughs, was announced at
6:20, followed 20 minutes later by a Level 3, drawing squads of
officers from all Manhattan precincts. A highly unusual Level 4
mobilization, pulling in hundreds of officers from all over the
city, was announced at 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The police first tried to block demonstrators from marching on
Fifth Avenue, but the protesters swung west on West 55th Street,
then south, directly into the oncoming traffic on Avenue of the
Americas. Demonstration leaders said one police commander told them
they could have Fifth Avenue, and the march went back east on West
54th Street. But another commander blocked Fifth Avenue with a
solid line of officers and motor scooters at West 42d Street. Some
marshals tried, unsuccessfully, to halt the demonstration at West
44th Street, then raced ahead, linked arms and forced the marchers
only West 43d Street, where there was a long standoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shame, shame, shame,'' chanted the demonstrators, as brief,
club-swinging charges by the police broke out. Protesters,
including a woman in a wheelchair, were arrested and loaded aboard
hastily commandeered transit buses, and the horses were brought
into the packed crowd. Demonstrators hurled water bottles and
candles at the police.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually large groups of protesters worked their way past the
Public Library on Fifth Avenue and West 42d Street and went on _ in
a markedly calmer, almost choreographed manner, one demonstrator
remarked _ to Madison Square Park, where the rally ended around 9
p.m. The police, who by this time had greatly increased their
numbers, allowed the march to continue.
</P>
<P>
   There was confusion, too, over the number of arrests. The police
said Tuesday that 84 people had been arrested. But the organizers,
at a news conference at the midtown headquarters of the Gay and
Lesbian Anti-Violence Project, said their legal observers had
counted at least 136 arrests. One reason for the discrepancy could
be that some people taken into custody were later released because,
in the confusion of making many arrests, some officers failed to
fill out necessary paper work.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first people arrested in front of the Plaza Hotel,
Mark Robinson, said in a telephone interview from his holding cell
24 hours later that he had still not been before a judge. `'The
degree of disorganization here is staggering,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   One serious problem was that some of those arrested, most of
whom were held at least overnight, were said to be taking a complex
series of drugs to combat HIV infection or AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really terrified right now,'' said John Irizarry, who
missed two complete dosages of the 44 pills he must take daily for
multiple complications from AIDS, including kidney and heart
disease. ``Whatever you do, you can't miss a dose of your medicine,
it could definitely be life-threatening. I'm just scared to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea whatsoever this would happen,'' Irizarry said,
speaking from the office of his doctor, Paul Curtis Bellman, where
he was being rehydrated intravenously because he had little water
in jail. ``I just went to a peaceful candlelight vigil. It's my
first time being arrested or having any contact with the police
other than just asking directions.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pursley, the organizer, said there had been no effort to
apply for a demonstration permit because ``the political climate in
New York City now is almost impossible,'' and the police would have
tried to shunt the demonstration to side streets or deserted areas.
Asked if there had been any contacts with the police before the
crowd materialized at the Plaza, she said there had not.
</P>
<P>
   But, she added, the lack of a permit was ``no excuse for the way
the police responded. It was cruel and brutal.''
</P>
<P>
   As the crowd dispersed Monday night, First Deputy Police
Commissioner Patrick Kelleher defended the police tactics, saying:
</P>
<P>
   `'They had a right to gather. But once they left the sidewalk,
they were endangering the motorists, they were endangering the
pedestrians. And we were forced to make arrests.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Tuesday that, while he sympathized
with the marcher's cause, ``the police reacted to people attempting
to block the most crowded city in America. And if they do it again,
precisely the same thing will happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police originally, obviously, did not have the correct
number of police there; they didn't know this was going to take
place,'' the mayor said, adding: ``I very much support the point
that the lawful marchers were making, but I'm very unsympathetic to
those who acted illegally. I would hope the organizers of the march
are responsible enough to make that distinction.''

THATCHER HAD PINOCHET AS A GUEST TWO WEEKS BEFORE HIS ARREST
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Two weeks before Prime Minister Tony Blair's government
authorized the hospital-bed arrest of Augusto Pinochet, Margaret
Thatcher, a Blair predecessor, entertained the 82-year-old former
Chilean dictator over cocktails at her opulent house in Belgravia.
</P>
<P>
   The contrasting treatment captured the opposite views of
Pinochet held by Blair and his Labor Party contemporaries, liberals
who came of age in the 1960s and 1970s, and by the Conservative
Party long led by Thatcher.
</P>
<P>
   To conservatives, Pinochet was a staunch ally, one they could
count on in Latin America when Britain went to war with Argentina
over the Falkland Islands.
</P>
<P>
   To liberals, Pinochet was a brutal dictator who imprisoned,
tortured and murdered thousands of his left-wing political
opponents and whose use of Britain as a sanctuary, whether to shop
or to avail of the medical care he was under when arrested, is a
disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's legacy will get a long, vitriolic airing here.
Recovering from back surgery at the London Clinic, he is not
expected to be well enough to make an initial court appearance here
for another two weeks. His lawyers say he will vigorously oppose
efforts to extradite him to Spain, where a judge wants to question
him about the murders of 94 Spaniards, Chileans, Britons,
Argentines and Americans during his reign between 1973 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
   And in a move that could keep Pinochet here even longer than the
protracted extradition proceedings, a group of Chilean exiles here
said Tuesday they would file a lawsuit charging him with murdering
and terrorizing political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that Pinochet is in custody in London, we for the first
time have the opportunity to lay these charges before a British
court,'' the group, Chileans in Exile, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said it was possible that Britain would not
extradite Pinochet if he were facing a pending legal action here.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives have accused the Blair government of playing
politics with the legal system. Chilean diplomats say Pinochet, who
is a senator for life in Chile, had been traveling on a diplomatic
passport and his arrest violated diplomatic immunity.
</P>
<P>
   But British government officials insist they have handled the
extradition request by the book. They say diplomatic immunity
applies only to heads of state and diplomats assigned specifically
to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's Cabinet has plenty of old ``lefties.'' For instance, the
man who will ultimately decide whether Pinochet is extradited, Home
Secretary Jack Straw, made an extraordinary pledge that he would
not let his old left-wing politics influence his decision.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives, meanwhile, are lapping up the opportunity to
portray Blair and his ministers as chablis-and-brie liberals who
want to sacrifice Pinochet, and the notion of diplomatic immunity,
to score points with the left wing of the Labor Party that accuses
Blair of going soft on the party's core principles.
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial Tuesday, The Daily Telegraph, the most
right-wing of Britain's national newspapers, accused Blair of
turning the legal process into a political one.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in the same newspaper, columnist Anthony Daniels argued
that despite Pinochet's record on human rights, he was a staunch
ally and improved Chile's economy during his reign.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one doubts that Pinochet was a murderer,'' Daniels said.
``But no one doubts either that he is the savior of his country. It
is the uncomfortable juxtaposition of these two facts which makes
him so difficult a figure to judge.''
</P>
<P>
   The discomfort extends to Blair's top aides, including Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook, who is unable to take credit for the tough
stance taken against Pinochet because doing so would make the
arrest appear political.
</P>
<P>
   Thatcher's office confirmed that she and her husband, Denis,
hosted Pinochet at the couple's home in the exclusive Belgravia
section of London, just four days before the former dictator had
surgery on Oct. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Worthington, a spokesman for Thatcher, said she ``regarded
it as a private meeting.''

BROTHER OF SALINAS SWAERS INNOCENCE IN SWISS CASE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ More than $100 million belonging to the brother of
a former Mexican president was ordered confiscated by Swiss
authorities, who say he got the money for protecting drug shipments
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the announcement in Switzerland Tuesday, Raul
Salinas de Gortari, whose brother served as Mexico's president from
1988 to 1994, declared his innocence and accused Swiss and US
investigators of fabricating evidence against him. His denials were
delivered from a Mexican prison, where he is being held in the
death of a political rival.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's development's are the latest and most public chapters
yet in a nearly three-year-old saga between law enforcement
authorities and one of this country's once-powerful but now
disgraced political families.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Salinas, who has been in exile since leaving office, is
blamed by many Mexicans for causing the 1994 peso crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Older brother Raul, a former Mexico City police chief and one of
his closest political advisers, stands accused of protecting drug
cartel shipments in exchange for hundreds of millions of dollars.
He has also been charged with illegal enrichment while he was a
government official and with masterminding the murder of Jose
Francisco Ruiz Massieu, a former brother-in-law and top ruling
party official who was a political rival.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss authorities say Salinas deposited up to $450 million in
overseas accounts from more than $500 million he received to
protect US-bound drug shipments.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the money ordered confiscated Tuesday, $89.9 million, is
in Swiss bank accounts. The prosecutors also are asking Britain to
seize $24.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss prosecutor Carla del Ponte discussed the case against
Salinas at a news conference in Bern, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas, in a letter from prison, said the money in the accounts
was received from business associates and was to be used for
investments.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas said the Swiss had ``illegally seized these resources''
and that ``not once have they demonstrated interest in finding
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Salinas's lawyers also argued that Swiss authorities based their
investigation mostly on testimony gathered from anonymous witnesses
interviewed by US officials. Eduardo Luengo Creel, one of Salinas's
attorneys, said many of the witnesses were either paid or were
criminals who had their sentences reduced in exchange for their
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``The objective of (Swiss and US investigators) is to depict
Mexico and the Mexican government as a drug state,'' Luengo added.
He promised that he would file an appeal with the Swiss supreme
court.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican prosecutors last week asked for the maximum sentence _
50 years in prison _ if Salinas is convicted in Ruiz's death.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican newspapers reported over the weekend that several
members of Salinas's family, including the former president, met in
Cuba to come up with a strategy to counter the Swiss announcement,
which they had been expecting.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss prosecutors said the money in the accounts appeared to
have been laundered, but dropped a criminal case against Salinas
earlier in deference to a similar investigation begun by Mexico.

<SLUG> BC-CLINTON-JONES-2NDTAKE-NYT </SLUG>
  
 ST. PAUL, Minn.: a jury. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ms. Jones canceled plans to appear in the courtroom Tuesday
because, her lawyers said, she could not obtain baby sitting help
to come from her home in California. Clinton was not expected to
appear but a small folding chair with a tag reserving the chair for
``William Jefferson Clinton'' was set up in the well of the
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have been in intense negotiations in the last few
weeks to settle the case that has brought Clinton to the brink of
impeachment. The talks broke down over the weekend when Ms. Jones'
camp of competing sets of lawyers, would-be benefactors and
informal advisers fell to bickering over how much money she should
get to withdraw the lawsuit. The White House swiftly rejected her
final demand that Clinton pay her $1 million as part of a $2
million settlement package.
</P>
<P>
   It is unusual for a party to try and settle a case it has
already won, but White House officials have said that they are
expecting the appeals court to reinstate the case. More
importantly, Clinton and his advisers have decided that eliminating
the Jones case from the political landscape will help them in
dealing with Congress over impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bennett, Clinton's principal attorney in the Jones
lawsuit, was present Tuesday but did not argue the case. When
Clinton swore he had not engaged in sexual relations with Ms.
Lewinsky during the January deposition, Bennett reinforced the
denial. Bennett has since written to Wright saying he, too, was
misled by the president, and his withdrawal from Tuesday's argument
was widely seen as an effort to avoid questioning about that from
the judges.
</P>
<P>
   He later told reporters that the last settlement offer from the
Jones camp was unacceptable both because the $1 million demand was
too high and because the other $1 million was to come from Abe
Hirschfeld, a New York-based real estate magnate. Hirschfeld has
said he wants to provide the money to help end what he has
described as a silly lawsuit, but White House officials are wary of
his involvement. It is unclear, they said, whether his contribution
would be a donation to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said he still hoped that a settlement could be achieved
in coming days, a sentiment echoed a few minutes later before the
same group of reporters by Donovan J. Campbell, one of Ms. Jones'
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones has her own powerful reasons for achieving a
settlement. Even if she were to have her case reinstated and go on
to win at trial, there is no guarantee she would win damages
anywhere near the $700,000 the president has offered.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The three judges on the panel hearing Tuesday's argument, all
appointees of Republican presidents and regarded as judicial
conservatives, have ruled against Clinton in the past on other
matters in the Jones case. Bowman and Judge Arlen C. Beam, who also
seemed sympathetic to Ms. Jones, were appointed by President
Reagan; Ross was appointed by President Richard M. Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they have in recent months become more open to
allowing sexual harassment cases to go to a jury.
</P>
<P>
   In July, for example, a separate three-judge panel that was also
headed by Bowman, ruled that a female worker at United Parcel
Service in Little Rock could bring her case to trial. In that case,
a lower court judge had thrown out the complaint on summary
judgment, as did Wright in Ms. Jones' case. The 8th Circuit judges
said they were making the ruling even though they believed the case
was borderline, because a supervisor did nothing more than pat the
woman on the back, brush up against her and tell her she smelled
nice.

 &HT;    Kindness at heart of shops
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ As important as the advancement in
post-mastectomy products and styles is a new emphasis on service.
</P>
<P>
   Today's sales clerks are sympathetic as well as knowledgable.
Chances are that they or someone in their immediate family have
been diagnosed with breast cancer as well.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Adkins, owner of Personal Touch Apparel in West
Carrollton, says her primary reason for opening a shop was to help
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was diagnosed with breast cancer when I was 36 and had a
modified radical mastectomy in 1988,'' she says. ``I've been there,
and I know what my customers are going through. You never forget
that feeling of being told you have breast cancer . . . and the
fear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very personal service,'' says Brenda Mitchell, who
opened Silhouettes For Women in 1992 with her sister, Debbie Adams.
``For a woman to have to come in and take her blouse and bra off
and be measured can be difficult for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams, who had a mastectomy in 1991, thought there was a need
for a ``feminine, comfortable place, warm and inviting with a
salon-type setting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted it to be more of a shopping experience than a
medical visit,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Their shop is made pretty with scented candles and attractive
displays.
</P>
<P>
   Along with knowing how to fit a prosthesis, a good sales clerk
provides sympathy, a shoulder to cry on, encouragement and hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hug and kiss everyone who walks in here,'' says Isabella
Hammonds, 78, who's been in the prosthesis and bra business for 30
years as owner of Isabella's Bra-Tique.
</P>
<P>
   One of those who's been on the receiving end of her hugs and
kisses is Sandra Dulaney.
</P>
<P>
   ``About six years ago I was incorrectly fit with a prosthesis
somewhere else, and I was miserable for two years because my
clothes didn't fit right.''
</P>
<P>
   Bettilynn Pasley, originally trained to fit mastectomy customers
at McAlpin's, says it is possible to supplement a woman's bra
wardrobe with those from regular manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to know the product to know what it does,'' explains
Pasley, who now works in the lingerie department at the Dayton Mall
Elder-Beerman. ``Then when you see the woman, you know what to get
for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the range of products, shopkeepers still encounter women
who have had surgery but don't own a prosthesis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had one lady who had surgery 14 years ago and had never been
fitted,'' says Shirley Adkins. ``She walked out looking natural
with a smile on her face and no one would ever have known she'd had
a breast removed,'' says Adkins. ``That's my main objective.''

 ST. PAUL, Minn.: a jury. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ms. Jones canceled plans to appear in the courtroom Tuesday
because, her lawyers said, she could not obtain baby sitting help
to come from her home in California. Clinton was not expected to
appear but a small folding chair with a tag reserving the chair for
``William Jefferson Clinton'' was set up in the well of the
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have been in intense negotiations in the last few
weeks to settle the case that has brought Clinton to the brink of
impeachment. The talks broke down over the weekend when Ms. Jones'
camp of competing sets of lawyers, would-be benefactors and
informal advisers fell to bickering over how much money she should
get to withdraw the lawsuit. The White House swiftly rejected her
final demand that Clinton pay her $1 million as part of a $2
million settlement package.
</P>
<P>
   It is unusual for a party to try and settle a case it has
already won, but White House officials have said that they are
expecting the appeals court to reinstate the case. More
importantly, Clinton and his advisers have decided that eliminating
the Jones case from the political landscape will help them in
dealing with Congress over impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bennett, Clinton's principal attorney in the Jones
lawsuit, was present Tuesday but did not argue the case. When
Clinton swore he had not engaged in sexual relations with Ms.
Lewinsky during the January deposition, Bennett reinforced the
denial. Bennett has since written to Wright saying he, too, was
misled by the president, and his withdrawal from Tuesday's argument
was widely seen as an effort to avoid questioning about that from
the judges.
</P>
<P>
   He later told reporters that the last settlement offer from the
Jones camp was unacceptable both because the $1 million demand was
too high and because the other $1 million was to come from Abe
Hirschfeld, a New York-based real estate magnate. Hirschfeld has
said he wants to provide the money to help end what he has
described as a silly lawsuit, but White House officials are wary of
his involvement. It is unclear, they said, whether his contribution
would be a donation to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said he still hoped that a settlement could be achieved
in coming days, a sentiment echoed a few minutes later before the
same group of reporters by Donovan J. Campbell, one of Ms. Jones'
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones has her own powerful reasons for achieving a
settlement. Even if she were to have her case reinstated and go on
to win at trial, there is no guarantee she would win damages
anywhere near the $700,000 the president has offered.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The three judges on the panel hearing Tuesday's argument, all
appointees of Republican presidents and regarded as judicial
conservatives, have ruled against Clinton in the past on other
matters in the Jones case. Bowman and Judge Arlen C. Beam, who also
seemed sympathetic to Ms. Jones, were appointed by President
Reagan; Ross was appointed by President Richard M. Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they have in recent months become more open to
allowing sexual harassment cases to go to a jury.
</P>
<P>
   In July, for example, a separate three-judge panel that was also
headed by Bowman, ruled that a female worker at United Parcel
Service in Little Rock could bring her case to trial. In that case,
a lower court judge had thrown out the complaint on summary
judgment, as did Wright in Ms. Jones' case. The 8th Circuit judges
said they were making the ruling even though they believed the case
was borderline, because a supervisor did nothing more than pat the
woman on the back, brush up against her and tell her she smelled
nice.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Tough cost controls and strong demand for its new
Windows 98 software boosted Microsoft Corp.'s net income by 58
percent, well ahead of analysts' expectations, and more good news
lies in store, the company said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it earned 56 cents a share in the quarter that
ended Sept. 30, compared to 36 cents in the same quarter a year
ago. Net income was $1.52 billion in the quarter, compared to $959
million in the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   The net-income figures exclude two large one-time items: a $160
million gain from the sale of Softimage, and a $296 million
write-off from last year's purchase of WebTV Networks. With those
items included, net income was $1.68 billion this year compared to
$663 million a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues in the quarter totaled $3.95 billion, up 26 percent
from $3.13 billion in the same quarter a year ago, the first of
Microsoft's fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's strong results together with those of other
high-tech companies ``do not suggest an economic meltdown''
stemming from economic problems in Asia, Chief Financial Officer
Greg Maffei said. ``The PC business is prospering.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM, for example, reported a 10 percent increase in
first-quarter profits Monday, beating analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also appears poised for strong performance in the next
few quarters, he said, suggesting that analysts should raise their
current expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears the consensus estimates from Wall Street are at
least a nickel per share light,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft shares fell 2 11/16, to 100 1/4, in regular U.S.
trading before the earnings were released. Later, in after-market
trading, the shares gained 3 1/2 to 103 3/4, according to Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, Microsoft said, it has sold more than 10 million
copies of Windows 98, the latest version of its market-leading
operating system for personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   It also reported record sales of its Windows NT Workstation
software, a kind of heavy-duty version of the operating system that
has mainly been used by businesses but increasingly is being aimed
at consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Office 97, the group of programs that includes word processing,
spreadsheet, presentation and other software tools, posted strong
results, though they have cooled somewhat from previous quarters,
the company said.
</P>
<P>
   It shipped an early version of the next-generation software,
called Office 2000, to about 20,000 testers during the quarter, and
a second test version of its much-anticipated Windows NT 5.0 to
more than 250,000 testers.
</P>
<P>
   Maffei avoided predicting when the final version of NT 5.0 will
be ready, but said a third test or ``beta'' version is expected to
be distributed in the first three months of 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
   VAIL, Colo. _ The suspicious fires that erupted across a snowy
mountain ridge high above here on Monday were still unsolved
Tuesday, but they have shed light on the dark grumblings in the
town below about a corporate ski giant that is seen by many
residents as aggressively acquiring water, business, real estate
and Forest Service land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vail Resorts used to be the 800-pound gorilla, they are now
the 4,000- pound gorilla,'' said Robert McLaurin, Vail's town
manager.
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized that the skiing giant was ``a pretty good
corporate citizen,'' but added, ``If you walk the streets of the
community, Vail Resorts is not held in particularly high regard.''
</P>
<P>
   Since it became a publicly traded company almost two years ago,
Vail Resorts has bought two ski areas, Keystone and Breckenridge,
and five hotels, and has started a joint venture with Colorado's
largest sporting goods chain. While visiting skiers routinely rate
Vail as the best ski area in the nation, residents here say they
see a different side, a company that is a monopolizing octopus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vail is a little like Microsoft,'' Jan Wanamaker, a
45-year-old caretaker, said Tuesday. ``They seem to be buying up
everything, hotels, real estate.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has claimed authorship of the fires, and it is not known
if they stemmed from any of the grievances in town. Isolated from
each other, but apparently erupting in linear sequence, the fires
destroyed a luxury restaurant, a picnic shelter and the mountain's
ski patrol headquarters. They also damaged buildings housing
machinery for four chair lifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that anything like this has happened in the
history of outdoor recreation in America,'' said John Frew,
president of Colorado Ski Country USA, an industry group. Referring
to the presumed fire setters, Frew added: ``They were very
strategic in their planning and execution. It was not happenstance,
not a series of lightning strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Romer on Tuesday called the fires ``an act of
terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the fires took place on U.S. Forest Service land, they
were being investigated by the FBI and by the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to look at it as a criminal investigation,'' Kim
Andree, spokesman for Eagle County Sheriff's Department, said
Tuesday. ``No one has taken responsibility. There have not been any
written messages.''
</P>
<P>
   Vail Resorts officials said Tuesday that the ski area, the
nation's largest, would open as scheduled, on Nov. 6. Estimating
the damage at around $12 million, Andy Daly, the company president,
said that three of the damaged chair lifts would be working by
opening day and that prefabricated, modular buildings would be
brought to the mountaintop by helicopter to replace the destroyed
restaurant. The fourth damaged chair lift will be running by
mid-January, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vail will bounce back. This will not affect the ski season,''
Daly said, noting that the ski area has 31 chair lifts and 12
restaurants on the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   But for skiing, a sport that has become an industry in recent
years, the fires seem to represent a loss of innocence.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, as baby boomers aged, the number of ski tickets
sold in Colorado, the nation's most popular skiing state, has
increased marginally. Faced with stagnating ticket sales, ski
companies increasingly try to make more money by moving off the
mountains into retail, restaurants and real estate. From the winter
of 1993-94 to the winter of 1996-97, the number of ski lift tickets
sold in Colorado increased by six percent, to almost 12 million,
while the dollars generated by the state's ski industry increased
by 29 percent, to $4.1 billion, according to Frew's industry group.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off the mountains, big ski companies like Vail and
American Ski, which is dominant in the Northeast, collide with
small, independently owned stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``The corporate world is buying up everything they can and
trying to monopolize it,'' said Geoff Wells, a Vermont native who
manages an independent ski store here.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Wells said, he tried to rent a storefront in Beaver
Creek, a ski village dominated by Vail Resorts. ``Vail told me, you
can't sell hats, you can't sell gloves, you can't sell socks, you
can't rent skis.''
</P>
<P>
   In Vail, restaurateurs complain that Eagle's Nest, a popular new
midmountain restaurant and entertainment complex, is drawing
patrons out of the village.
</P>
<P>
   ``They admit to taking 1,200 people a day out of Vail during the
winter season,'' said Jonathan J. Staufer, who owns a gourmet
kitchen supply business. ``That's the equivalent of 12 restaurants
a day going up the gondola.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam Aron, the company chairman, retorted Tuesday, ``There is no
evidence that we are eating the lunch of anyone around town.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have shown a clear desire that we do not intend to dominate
our towns,'' Aron continued. Noting that the company rents most of
its storefront space to outsiders, he said, ``We are willing to
work with independent entrepreneurs.''
</P>
<P>
   Aron said that by going public the company had been able to
attract the capital to keep Vail as a world class resort. He said
that in the last two years, the company had invested $200 million
in improvements on the mountains of its four areas, had improved
its central reservation service, and had invested heavily to expand
jet service here in the winter. While Vail Eagle airport did not
have regularly scheduled service eight years ago, this winter it
will offer direct flights to 13 American cities.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists are seeking to exploit local business
dissatisfaction with Vail Resorts in their campaign to stop the ski
area's plan to expand into 885 acres of National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Ancient Forest Rescue, an environmental
group, mailed letters to 350 ski clubs around the nation asking
them that if they came to Vail, they should go to establishments
owned by independent operators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community has been overwhelmingly opposed to what Vail is
doing in Category 3,'' said Jeff Berman, a leader of the group,
referring to Vail's back country expansion. ``Ski resort employees
who have spoken against it have been told to shut up.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman said that a Forest Service query period elicited comments
from 375 people who were opposed to the expansion, from 20 people
who were neutral, and from 6 who were in favor. Opposition speakers
dominated three meetings held last spring by the Eagle County
Commissioners. Nevertheless, the Commissioners voted to approve the
project.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists contend that the development would harm
wildlife migration and would only serve to raise the value of a
6,000-acre parcel of private land. The resort company has an option
to buy half of it.
</P>
<P>
   Aron of Vail Resorts said that such opposition flies in the fact
of ``facts and science and environmental sensitivity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The expansion was approved by the local government, by the
state government by the federal government, by the district
court,'' Aron said of a series of obstacles which were finally
cleared last week.

IMMIGRANT'S DEATH IN HOUSTON DRAWS RIGHTS QUERY 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Mayor Lee Brown, Rep. Sheila Jackson-Lee, D-Texas,
four City Council members and several civil rights leaders are
asking the Justice Department to determine whether the fatal
shooting of a Mexican immigrant by six Houston police officers in
July violated federal civil rights laws.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Pedro Oregon, 22, shot 12 times by officers who had
burst into his bedroom while chasing an informant's tip that drugs
were being sold in the apartment, has strained relations in the
nation's fourth-largest city between police, city officials and a
sizable Hispanic community. The tension was worsened by a county
grand jury's decision on Monday indicting only one of the six
officers and only on a misdemeanor charge of trespassing.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the Justice Department responded Tuesday that it
was aware of the Oregon case. ``It's something we are already
looking at, something that has been open for some time now,'' said
Christine DiBartolo, a spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Oregon family denounced the grand jury's
decision, and said they would press lawsuits against the officers
and the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is very significant that the mayor has called for
the attorney general of the United States to initiate an
investigation and I am heartened by certain members of the City
Council who are likewise calling for investigation,'' said Richard
Mithoff, a lawyer for the Oregon family. ``The whole incident is
senseless and it just drives home, unfortunately, the tragic notion
that there are really two Americas.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown issued a statement intended to soothe tempers, saying that
the grand jury decision was ``just one step in a series of steps to
be taken in this case.'' He promised that the police department's
internal investigation would continue, and asked for the separate
federal investigation to augment it.
</P>
<P>
   Mithoff has filed a civil suit demanding $35 million in
compensation for Oregon's death, but said the family would be
willing to negotiate a settlement if it came with changes in city
policies and police procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Nugent, another lawyer for the Oregon family, said he found
the grand jury's decision ``disgusting and puzzling,'' and said he
could not understand why only one officer was indicted.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting occurred on July 12 when six members of a Houston
police task force in a largely Hispanic section of the city burst
into Oregon's apartment following what they said was a tip from an
informant that drugs were being sold there.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mithoff, three people in the apartment's living
room, Oregon's brother, his brother-in-law and a female friend,
were handcuffed and put on the ground while the officers made their
way down the hallway to Oregon's bedroom. The officers burst into
the room and more than 30 shots were fired, all by the officers.
Twelve struck Oregon, nine in the back, Mithoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials, quoted anonymously by The Houston Chronicle,
said that Oregon had brandished a gun and that the shooting had
started when one of the officers' weapons accidentally discharged,
striking another officer. The officers believed the shot came from
Oregon, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A gun was found in Oregon's bedroom, Mithoff said, but it had
not been fired. The officers had no warrant to enter the apartment.
And despite several searches that night and on subsequent nights,
police officers were unable to find evidence of drugs in the
apartment or any evidence linking Oregon, a landscape gardener,
soccer coach and father of two, to the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   But John Holmes Jr., the district attorney of Harris County,
said the shooting could still be justified if Oregon had resisted,
because under Texas law it is unlawful to resist any police search
or arrest, even an illegal one. ``I am unaware of any evidence
suggesting that the persons in the residence did not know the entry
was gained by police officers,'' Holmes wrote in July in a letter
to The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Nugent said the case had stirred many Hispanic residents in
Houston because it resembled other incidents of police abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``This young man was a soccer player,'' Mithoff said. ``He
coached a little girls' soccer team. He went to bed early that
night because he was coaching a game the next morning. And they
shot him 12 times from the back in the middle of the night in his
own bedroom.''

 BofA Chief Is Asked To Leave   By Arthur M. Louis 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Faced with an ultimatum by his board of directors, David Coulter
announced yesterday that he is resigning as president and chief
operating officer of financially beleaguered BankAmerica Corp.
<P>
   When BankAmerica agreed to sell out to NationsBank in April, it
was widely assumed that Coulter, 51, eventually would succeed Hugh
McColl as chief executive officer of the combined bank.
</P>
<P>
   But those prospects went out the window last week when the bank
revealed a shocking 50 percent plunge in earnings, largely because
of Bank of America losses from foreign loans and from a speculative
investment fund.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter, who served as chief executive of the company's San
Francisco-based predecessor before it was acquired by NationsBank
last month, said in a press release that he is leaving ``with
regret,'' but he declined to offer any explanation.
</P>
<P>
   However, a source close to the Bank of America said that board
member William Johnson, head of the bank's executive committee,
visited Coulter in San Francisco last week and urged him to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted it sooner rather than later,'' said the source,
who asked to remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson did not return calls asking for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter is not coming away empty-handed. He will receive one of
the most generous ``golden parachute'' packages in American
business history _ severance pay, pension, stock and benefits worth
as much as $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   His departure effectively dismantles the old Bank of America _
for many decades San Francisco's largest and proudest financial
institution. Although the merged bank opted for the BankAmerica
name, its headquarters now repose in Charlotte, N.C. _ as do
virtually all of its key executives.
</P>
<P>
   McColl, chairman and CEO of BankAmerica, said in the press
release that it was ``painful'' to accept Coulter's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   But the source close to Bank of America management said Coulter
tried in vain to talk with McColl after being told to quit.
``McColl doesn't seem to feel that he needs to return David's phone
calls,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Both McColl and Coulter declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   No successor to Coulter has been named.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Joseph K. Morford, with Van Kasper &AMP; Co. in San
Francisco, said yesterday that the logical successor would be
Kenneth D. Lewis, who served as president of NationsBank before the
acquisition of BankAmerica, and currently serves as head of retail
banking at the merged operation.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of Coulter's resignation _ which takes effect
October 30 _ came six days after BankAmerica reported the plunge in
earnings for the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tumble in earnings, Coulter's resignation was
greeted with ``shock and surprise'' by employees at the BankAmerica
Tower on California Street, one employee reported.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings plunge was caused by huge losses from trading
securities and currencies and was blamed primarily on the old BofA
side of the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the trading loss stemmed from a $372 million write-off
of the bank's interest in a stock-and-options portfolio managed by
D.E. Shaw &AMP; Co., a New York investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts speculated that Coulter may not be the only highly
placed BofA executive asked to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Also vulnerable, they said, are Michael Murray, head of
corporate banking, who oversaw the operation in which the losses
occurred, and Michael O'Neill, chief financial officer, who had
major responsibility for the bank's risk management.
</P>
<P>
   John C. Wilson, managing director for financial services and
recruiting with Korn Ferry International in San Francisco, says
many in the financial community had been expecting Coulter's ouster
since the Shaw losses surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not surprising at all,'' Wilson remarked. ``What was
surprising was that the bank reported worse earnings than expected.
The Wall Street analysts were caught off guard. People in business
hate surprises.''

TROJANS' GREEK HERO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In his first two seasons at USC, Petros Papadakis
spent a lot of time on the sidelines. But when injuries knocked
Chad Morton from the USC backfield, Papadakis went from standing
still to gaining 118 yards against Cal on Oct. 10. Last week
against Washington State and with Morton back, Papadakis gained 84
yards on just six carries.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't had that much work since he gained 2,026 yards and
scored 22 touchdowns in 1994 as a senior at Peninsula High. Still,
according to quarterback Mike Van Raaphorst, every Trojan knew
about Papadakis' potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone on this team has seen it,'' Van Raaphorst said.
``Once he gets ahead, you're not catching him from behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Speed is what Morton and receiver R. Jay Soward have, but you
just wouldn't think a 6-foot-1, 215-pounder would be that fast.
Papadakis has a 65-yard run (vs. Cal) and a 53-yarder (vs.
Washington State).
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a stalemate at the line for a minute,'' Papadakis
said of the 65-yard first-quarter run against Cal. ``I got to the
line and throttled down, and when (guard Jason Grain) dumped his
guy, I slipped through. After that I had an open field.''
</P>
<P>
   It seemed so familiar to Papadakis, but it wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``They probably misjudged my speed,'' he said, ``because no one
has seen me go anywhere in about five years.''
</P>
<P>
   The junior tailback redshirted his first season at USC and saw
limited playing time last year, appearing in 10 games but earning
only 24 carries and 103 yards rushing. This year didn't start out
much better. His lack of success was magnified with the absence of
Morton, whose back problems have kept him from the starting lineup
since the team's loss at Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   Papadakis started against Oregon State but gained only 11 yards
in six carries. Morton came on in relief and gained 123 yards on 23
carries and scored a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The following week against Arizona State, with Morton remaining
on the sideline in street clothes, Papadakis had just 17 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was starting to get down,'' said Papadakis, whose lone
bright spot to that point was a 1-yard scoring run in the
season-opening win over Purdue. ``I started to miss keys and miss
holes, which is not good. I was thinking maybe I was just a
Tank-group (short-yardage) guy.''
</P>
<P>
   His confidence was restored after his breakout game against Cal
_ and it couldn't have come at a better time. Out of high school,
he had signed a scholarship with the Bears, spending nearly three
months _ including the first week of football practice _ at
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably did so well because I knew those guys (at Cal),''
he said. ``I knew not to be scared of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Papadakis has easily avoided a big head after his best two games
as a collegiate player.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one game, that's the thing,'' said Papadakis, an English
Literature major who has a weekly Tuesday segment on Vic `The
Brick's' radio show on KXTA 1150. ``Maybe if I had 700 yards or
wasn't averaging 1.2 yards per carry, I would be basking in the
media glory.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead he was trying to avoid the family glory.
</P>
<P>
   The Papadakis family, which owns and operates the Papadakis
Taverna, a popular Greek restaurant in San Pedro, is a USC family.
Petros' father, John, played linebacker at USC in 1970-71 and older
brother Taso was a letterman in 1994 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   On game day at the L.A. Coliseum, there's generally 50 or so
Papadakis family members and friends on hand.

NASA DROPS GLENN FROM SHUTTLE EXPERIMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For undisclosed reasons, Sen. John Glenn has been dropped from
one of the main age-related experiments in which the 77-year-old
former astronaut had planned to take part during his return to
space next week, NASA officials confirmed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn will still fly aboard the shuttle Discovery on Oct. 29.
But in August he was dropped without announcement from a widely
publicized experiment designed to test the hypnotic effects of very
small amounts of the natural hormone, melatonin, on sleep and
daytime activities in space.
</P>
<P>
   The study's principal investigator, Dr. Charles A. Czeisler of
Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, said in interviews over the
weekend that he was surprised when he had to disqualify Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not meet one of the medical criteria that was
established for participation in our study,'' Czeisler said. But he
declined to specify the reason for the change, citing NASA's rule
forbidding disclosure of medical information without the subject's
permission.
</P>
<P>
   Through his spokesman, Jack Sparks, Glenn declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   NASA had rated the melatonin experiment as one of the two top
priorities in the human studies aboard Glenn's shuttle flight.
Glenn will still participate in two other planned experiments _
monitoring sleep and use of protein _ that focus on studying
similarities between aging on Earth and flying weightless in space.
Sleep disorders are a particular problem among the elderly and
astronauts, who in adjusting to the 90 minute day-night cycles in
space often take sleeping pills and sometimes stimulants.
</P>
<P>
   The experiments have been cited as the principal reasons Glenn
is going into space for the second time. In 1962, Glenn became the
first American to orbit Earth, and aboard Discovery he will become
the oldest person to fly in space. Glenn, an Ohio Democrat, won his
seat on the shuttle flight by lobbying NASA for two years to fly as
a human guinea pig for geriatric studies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The amounts of melatonin Glenn would have taken are 10 to 30
times smaller than the over-the-counter pills many people take to
reduce jet lag on long airplane flights. There are dozens of
ailments or sleep disorders that exclude participation in
Czeisler's study.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John B. Charles, who helps coordinate the human studies
aboard the Discovery, said that in his studies Czeisler had put
``strict requirements that don't apply to people who buy melatonin
off the shelf in health food stores.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Czeisler's team recognized a problem, NASA decided ``the
best thing was to eliminate the melatonin aspect of the experiment
and continue with the circadian rhythm aspects of the study'' that
are ``at least as important as the melatonin study,'' Charles said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is certainly not the complete study that we had hoped to
accomplish originally on this mission,'' Charles said, ``but we are
still doing everything except swallowing a pill.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's disqualification from the melatonin portion of the sleep
study came just before he underwent the second in a series of sleep
studies at the Johnson Space Center in Houston that will be
compared to data gathered in space.
</P>
<P>
   The development is surprising because NASA has long known the
criteria for the melatonin study and has said it has more than 40
years of medical information on Glenn. Asked why NASA had not
detected a problem earlier, Charles said: ``There are imperfections
in the transmission of data between people who have it, especially
confidential medical data.''
</P>
<P>
   And Czeisler said he believed that the few doctors at NASA who
had access to Glenn's medical records ``did not have extensive
information about our exclusionary criteria.''
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, Czeisler's team examines candidates for the sleep
studies in Boston. But Czeisler said his team agreed to NASA's
request that its doctors conduct the examinations in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The melatonin studies were conducted on four members of the
Neurolab shuttle flight earlier this year, and another member of
the Discovery's crew, Dr. Chiaki Mukai, will be a fifth
participant, Czeisler said.
</P>
<P>
   Czeisler's specialty is sleep disorders, and in a scientific
paper in 1991 he pointed out similarities in disorders of sleep and
the body clock among the elderly and astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   The consent form that volunteers must sign to take part in the
study states that ``results could lead to the development of a new
treatment for sleep disturbances associated with spaceflight'' and
``could have a profound impact on the health, productivity and
safety'' for people ``such as shift workers and the elderly.''
</P>
<P>
   The original plan called for Glenn to swallow a pill before
retiring on each of the nine nights on the flight. On some nights
he would take melatonin, on others, a placebo.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the disqualification, the scientists will not be able
to use Glenn to test two of their original four hypotheses. The two
studies that will be excluded are that taking melatonin before
sleep reduces sleep disruption and improves efficiency during
flight, and that the improved sleep resulting from melatonin use
will make a crew member perkier and perform better the following
day.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn will still make important contributions about sleep
because it will be the first time that sleep recordings have been
made on someone his age in space, said Czeisler and his
co-investigator, Dr. Rod J. Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   On four night, Glenn and Mukai will wear special sensors that
record brain waves and movement of the eyes and chin. They will
also strap a device on the chest to record the number of
respirations. A wrist device will record movements while awake and
asleep, and a fingertip sensor will measure the amount of oxygen in
the blood.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn and Mukai will also swallow a pill containing a
thermometer to continually measure their core body temperatures and
correlate that data with their sleep patterns. An antenna worn over
the upper part of the body will detect signals and alert the crew
member to swallow another thermometer pill after the previous one
passes through the digestive system.
</P>
<P>
   For 20 minutes on the following day, Glenn and Mukai will
perform tasks on a laptop computer to measure alertness, fatigue,
sleepiness, vigilance and other mood and cognitive functions.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said: ``Maybe I'm rationalizing, but one could argue that
including Glenn in the melatonin portion of the trial was a little
bit of walking before you learn how to crawl.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn will participate in other studies of how the body uses
protein in space. No problems have arisen in those studies, Dr.
Arny A. Ferrando of the University of Texas Medical Branch in
Galveston and the principal investigator of the protein studies,
said in an interview.

   FEATURE Stories
</P>
<P>
   LICHTENSTEIN-BAM (New York) _ Before I start examining their
edges and undersides, let me lay my cards on the table. Harvey
Lichtenstein _ who turns 70 next spring and who recently announced
his retirement, effective June 30, after 31 years as head of the
Brooklyn Academy of Music _ has been the most innovative and
influential performing arts administrator New York has known. This
is not a game, so there's no point in ticking off the not-so-long
list of his recent competitors, icons like Joe Papp, Ellen Stewart
and Morton Baum. But Papp, for one, is better known to the general
public than Lichtenstein, even now. So it's worth trying to explain
why Lichtenstein has been so important not just to the cultural
life of New York, but to the country and the world. By John
Rockwell. (Moved).

<P>
   DANCE
</P>
<P>
   NIKOLAIS-LOUIS-DANCE (New York) _ For Murray Louis, landmark
events are not only the most obviously important occurences. The
Murray Louis and Nikolais Dance Company will celebrate a 50th
anniversary, for instance, in a weeklong season that opens on
Tuesday at the Joyce Theater. Louis and Alwin Nikolais, who died in
1993, taught at the Henry Street Settlement House and performed in
its theater from 1948 until 1970. By Jennifer Dunning. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN-BALLET-THEATER (Undated) _ In its early days,
publicists for American Ballet Theater frequently called it ``a
museum of the dance.'' That remains a good phrase to describe the
company, provided one realizes that great museums can encourage new
art as well as preserve old. Ever since its debut in 1940, Ballet
Theater has done both. It has staged the classics, often in
elaborate productions. It has commissioned major world premieres.
Kevin McKenzie, the troupe's current artistic director, is
continuing these policies. the current season will give New Yorkers
their first look at John Neumeier's ``Spring and Fall,'' a work to
Dvorak from the repertory of Neumeier's Hamburg Ballet, and new
creations by Twyla Tharp, Nacho Duato and John Selya, one of Ballet
Theater's own dancers. By Jack Anderson. (Moved).

``Killer Joe,'' at the SoHo Playhouse Off Broadway in New York.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   OLD-SETTLER-THEATER (Undated) _ It is 1943 in Harlem, with Ella
Fitzgerald crooning, newly arrived Southerners gawking and
housekeepers calling to Jesus in storefront churches and
lindy-hopping until dawn at the Savoy Ballroom. The playwright John
Henry Redwood recreates those heady days in ``The Old Settler,'' a
bittersweet comedy in previews Off Broadway at Primary Stages,
where it opens on Wednesday. It is the story of Elizabeth Borny, a
lonely, middle-aged domestic who rents a room in her apartment to a
naive young Southerner and falls in love with him, despite the
disapproval of her sister, Quilly, who knows better. By Rachel L.
Swarns. (Moved).

<P>
   CLASSICAL MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   ST.-LUKE-ORCHESTRA (New York) _ The Orchestra of St. Luke's was
born as an outgrowth of the St. Luke's Chamber Ensemble, whose 21
players still form its core. A chamber style of performance is
first nature. In addition to its own concerts, it works for hire in
a variety of settings. Even the name has become a red herring,
since the many locations in which the organization performs rarely
include the Church of St. Luke in the Fields, in Greenwich Village,
where it gave its first chamber concerts, in 1974. This season the
organization is trying to address the world's befuddlement and
bring its image into sharper focus through the odd expedient of
attaching itself to another name: Haydn. The chamber ensemble plays
the composer's Symphonies Nos. 6, 7 and 8 (``Morning,'' ``Noon''
and ``Night''), conductorless, Sunday afternoon at the Brooklyn
Museum of Art and on Wednesday evening at Weill Recital Hall. By
James R. Oestreich. (Moved).

   PLASTICS-ANTIQUES (Katonah, N.Y.) _ Remember the so-called
throwaway plastic culture of the 60s? Well, no one threw it away,
and 30 years later, pristine artifacts from that period are already
turning up in exhibitions. The 160 objects on view in ``Pop Goes
the Plastic: The Visual and Cultural Esthetic of a New Technology
1960-1975'' at the Katonah Museum of Art document the revolution in
industrial design fostered by the coming of age of plastics. By

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Commerce Department on Tuesday provided a
concrete measure of the effects of the global economic downturn on
the American economy, reporting that the nation's trade deficit
widened by $2.2 billion in August to $16.77 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That is the widest gap since the government recalculated the way
it measures trade flows in 1992. It resulted from a decline in
American exports and a sharp increase in what this country buys
from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, the trade deficit is running roughly 50
percent above last year's levels and is up to a projected $170
billion for the year, a gap that is expected to widen even further.
One senior administration official who deals with economic issues,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said Tuesday that internal
projections suggest that the trade deficit in 1999 could reach $300
billion, a figure that he said ``will certainly cut into growth,
and could well become a major political problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Trade deficits carry with them both good and troubling signals
about the economy. The current flood of imports is helping contain
inflation to some of the lowest levels in decades. And while sales
of American aircraft, computer chips and other goods are suffering,
the weakening of the dollar on world markets in recent weeks may
provide an end-of-the-year boost for American exporters.
</P>
<P>
   But at this moment of global upheaval, the biggest problem
facing American companies is the inability of many nations and some
large companies in Asia and Latin America simply to borrow money to
make ordinary purchases. The result is such a freeze of economic
activity that empty shipping containers are stacking up on American
piers. And the effects are hurting everyone from Midwest farmers
who can no longer send wheat to an impoverished Russia, to East
Coast fishermen who are discovering that Japan's appetite for
salmon and lobster has been ruined by the banking crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most surprising elements of Tuesday's report is that
more than a third of August's deficit was with one country that so
far has managed to ward off the worst effects of the global
troubles: China. Despite continued growth of the Chinese economy,
exports to China have slowed dramatically and imports of
Chinese-made goods have exploded, as the country desperately seeks
to sell here goods that would ordinarily be sold elsewhere in Asia.
That increased the monthly deficit with Beijing to $5.9 billion,
levels previously only seen in trade with Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese _ besieged by floods, deeply troubled state-owned
industries and an incipient banking crisis _ have signaled to the
United States in recent weeks that they have little interest in any
swift moves to open their markets further in return for entry into
the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   That amounts to a major setback for President Clinton, who for
three years has been using the negotiations over China's entry to
the world body as the centerpiece of his effort to open China both
economically and politically. Ostensible progress in this area has
been cited by the administration until recently as one of the
successes of the administration's China policy, but now officials
say privately that the progress is evaporating.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in exports will trim the growth of the American
economy, and it was one factor in the Federal Reserve's decision to
lower interest rates two times in recent weeks. So administration
officials were going out of their way Tuesday to portray the
numbers as another warning sign, but not a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the United States remains strong and sound, the troubled
condition of the global marketplace continue to strongly influence
the U.S. trade balance,'' Commerce Secretary Williams Daley said in
a statement Tuesday.
</P>

<P>
   After China, the biggest deterioration in the American trade
balance in August came in Mexico, where the peso has weakened
markedly as economic contagion has spread through Latin America.
Exports to Mexico have remained unchanged. But imports from Mexico
have increased markedly _ chiefly automobiles and automotive parts
and telecommunications equipment _ as American manufacturers have
taken advantage of the weakening currency.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, America's trade surplus with Brazil, the latest
focus of concern by the administration and the International
Monetary Fund, barely budged from the same period a year ago.
Normally, that would be cited as a sign of continued demand for
American products in Latin America's largest economy, but there is
fear it might be imperiled.
</P>
<P>
   The news comes as the United States and the IMF complete a
bailout package of $30 billion or more for Brazil, intended to help
it stave off the kind of economic troubles that have swept through
Asia, Russia and several other nations. Tuesday the IMF and Brazil
reached agreement on the country's fiscal targets for this year and
next, a sign that the aid will likely be announced after elections
in Brazil this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But for all these potential problems, the rising trade deficit
has barely caused a ripple on Capitol Hill. Because the rising
level of imports does not appear to be triggering any unemployment
here, the subject has barely come up in races for the House and
Senate around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The only exception has been in regions where the steel industry
is strong. The major steel companies have charged in recent weeks
that Asian nations are dumping products on the American market at
prices well below their costs. The Commerce Department has begun an
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department's numbers showed that the deficit rose
15.3 percent to $16.77 billion in August, up from a revised figure
of $14.55 billion in July. The department said that the resumption
of production at General Motors Corp. after last summer's strike
may have increased the size of the deficit's rise in August, as GM
brought in parts from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The deficit was the highest since the Commerce Department began
a new method of tracking trade information in 1992. Exports, the
department said, fell three tenths of 1 percent, to about $74.8
billion. Imports rose 2.2 percent to $91.6 billion.

VICE PRESIDENT, IN MIDWEST, RISES TO NO. 1 CAMPAIGNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa _ This is crunch time in the 1998 campaign
season, and no Democrat is likely to be hammering Republicans
around the country more extensively than Vice President Al Gore in
the two weeks remaining before the Nov. 3 elections.
</P>
<P>
   With Democrats sensing improved chances and President Clinton
cutting back his travel to accommodate developments like the
Middle-East negotiations in Wye Mills, Md., Gore has become the
administration's busiest spokesman on the campaign trail, defending
Clinton's policies, criticizing the opposition and raising money.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy continued Tuesday in Illinois and Iowa, where the
vice president made eight campaign appearances in five cities
before flying on to New Mexico and California for more speeches
over the next two days. Between now and the elections, aides say he
could visit as many as a dozen states _ more, if Clinton stays
home.
</P>
<P>
   In large measure, Gore is focusing on tightly contested House
races, or at least those in which a Democrat would have a better
chance of winning if the turnout were high. And if a Democratic
candidate for governor needs help, as Tom Vilsack does in Iowa, so
much the better.
</P>
<P>
   Vilsack, a state lawmaker who is challenging Jim Lightfoot, a
Republican, to succeed Gov. Terry Branstad, a Republican who is
retiring, accompanied Gore at each of his six stops Tuesday in
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're going to break any new ground on the
issues,'' an aide to Gore said. ``The focus now is turnout. We have
to bring up the level of enthusiasm, raise the level for
grass-roots intensity. We've made our arguments; we just have to
reinforce them.''
</P>
<P>
   Traveling around Iowa has an added benefit for Gore because, as
the probable Democratic front-runner to succeed Clinton, he can
expand his base in the state that holds the first presidential
caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   It has only been in recent weeks that Democrats have found
evidence through recent polls that the midterm elections might
produce something less than a disaster for them.
</P>
<P>
   Early predictions that the impeachment inquiry against Clinton
would cause Democrats to lose scores of seats in the House have
largely given way to more optimistic expectations, perhaps a loss
of fewer than 34, the historical average for the party in the White
House in the sixth year of an administration.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason, Gore said at a rally in Davenport for Bob
Rush, the Democrat challenging Rep. Jim Leach, an 11-term
Republican incumbent, is that Democrats perceive voters as angry
that Congress spent too much time on the Clinton sex scandal at the
expense of important legislation.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a new thought as part of Gore's standard stump speech,
which stresses education, health care and preserving Social
Security. But his expanding emphasis on Republican scandal-lust is.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Gore has been refining the core of his criticism
with a suggestion that voters should make the impeachment
proceedings an Election Day referendum, a change from several
months ago when Democrats feared the scandal would bury them in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say, let's put it to a vote of the American people,'' as
Gore said in Moline, Ill., campaigning for Rep. Lane Evans, an
eight-term Democrat facing a strong challenge from Mark Baker, a
former television newsman and a Republican in his second bid for
election.

BRAZIL'S PLAN ON DEFICITS IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Brazilian officials ended four days of
meetings with representatives of the International Monetary Fund on
Tuesday without living up to their public pledge to announce
concrete measures to reduce government deficits.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Pedro Parente, executive secretary of the
Brazilian Finance Ministry, offered only details on Brazil's plans
for raising a primary account surplus over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   With only five days to go before gubernatorial runoffs on
Sunday, neither he nor President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, in
Brasilia, said how the government planned to achieve the savings.
Important allies of Cardoso are lagging behind in three key states,
and despite the government promises, market analysts did not expect
an announcement until after the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the strategy in Brasilia and Washington appeared to
focus on reassuring the markets that work on cutting the deficit
was going forward, without providing fodder for opponents in
domestic elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The discussions continue with the objective of reaching
agreement soon on the detailed program,'' said a joint statement by
the IMF and the Brazilian Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Brazil's enormous deficits, the collapse of emerging
markets has hit the nation particularly hard, draining foreign
currency reserves and pushing the economy toward recession. Finance
officials in Washington and around the world fear that a collapse
of Brazil, because of its size and links to other economies, would
worsen financial instability throughout the hemisphere. With 160
million people, Brazil represents the world's ninth-largest economy
and is the financial engine of Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, government officials met with Cardoso in
Brasilia and were expected to fine-tune a three-year austerity
package that Cardoso was to discuss with congressional party
leaders on Wednesday morning.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Brasilia, officials said that among the measures being
considered were a tax increase on financial transactions, to
three-tenths of a percent from two-tenths of a percent, and
extending the Fiscal Stabilization Fund, which sets aside 20
percent of all taxes collected for presidential discretionary
spending. The fund was to have expired by 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Washington, Parente said that Brazil would aim
toward a surplus of 2.6 percent in 1999, 2.8 percent in 2000 and 3
percent in 2001. It had already been announced, at the end of the
IMF's annual meeting in Washington two weeks ago that Brazil would
have to reach a primary account surplus of 2.5 percent to 3 percent
to qualify for IMF aid. The primary account covers government
expenses, without interest payments on debt.
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Brown, senior economist for Latin America at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, said signs that the Brazilian government and
the IMF were moving closer to an aid package were reassuring, and
that he did not expect much more than reassurance until next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call this the `We have a pope' scenario,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're just going to hear that we have a pope, maybe see the
white smoke rising,'' he said, ``and not figure out who the pope is
until after the elections.''

HUGE EGOS ARE MISSING, SAYS AYUSO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A glance at the USC basketball roster confirms
that the Trojans will be deeper and more talented than a year ago.
But a more important change could be the team's attitude. Just two
days into practice, senior guard Elias Ayuso already notices a
completely different atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more togetherness. Everyone is willing to accept each
other and accept their roles,'' Ayuso said. ``It's not a lot of
egos like last year. We had too many egos.''
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Henry Bibby brought in five highly regarded players
expected to make an immediate impact for the Trojans, who were a
disappointing 9-19 last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have great talent this year. All the new guys fill in the
holes we had last year,'' Ayuso said. ``They all came in with a
winning attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayuso should know. He played on a summer-league team with four
of the five newcomers: 6-foot-9 forward Brian Scalabrine; 6-7
forward Sam Clancy; 6-7 forward David Bluthenthal and 5-10 point
guard Brandon Granville. The other new player is 6-3 guard Quincy
Wilder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The five new players have shown they have skill. They can
compete. They are thinking like winners,'' Bibby said. ``To try and
change the whole thinking of the men's basketball program, we tried
to bring in winners.''
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine and Clancy are expected to compete for starting
positions, and all five players are expected to play.
</P>
<P>
   USC opens the season Nov. 17 at the Sports Arena against San
Diego State.
</P>
<P>
   __ Recruiting update: USC expects to sign 6-4 guard Nate Hair of
Capistrano Valley next month. The Trojans have one other
scholarship and are pursuing 6-9 forward Tajudeen Soyoye from
Meridian Junior College in Mississippi. Florida State, Missouri and
Tulane are also recruiting Soyoye. He is originally from Lagos,
Nigeria. He is not expected to sign until the spring.
</P>
<P>
   __ Women's basketball: USC women's coach Chris Gobrecht is also
more optimistic, thanks to an infusion of healthy bodies. After
usually going with no more than six healthy players last season,
Gobrecht will have 12-13 players this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to be good,'' Gobrecht said. ``My biggest
excitement is with the return of Erica Mashia. Every time she goes
up and down the floor, I can't believe this is what we didn't have
last year. She's big-time.''
</P>
<P>
   Mashia, a 5-7 guard, has not played the past two seasons because
of a hip injury, and doctors had told her she would never play
again.
</P>
<P>
   The Women of Troy open the season Nov. 19 at the Sports Arena
against Boise State.

AUTHORITIES SEARCH FOR DRIVER SWEPT OFF HIGHWAY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAUL McKAY 
and SALATHEIA BRYANT 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Authorities stepped up their search Tuesday for a man
who, along with a 38-year-old woman, was swept off a Montgomery
County road north of Houston as they tried to drive through rushing
floodwaters.
</P>
<P>
   As the search for the unidentified man continued along Spring
Creek and funeral arrangements were being made for the woman,
residents in Montgomery and Harris counties began cleaning up as
floodwaters from a weekend deluge slowly started receding in some
areas.
</P>
<P>
   To the west, however, folks along three rivers prepared for
floodwaters that continued rolling downstream and threatened to
swamp roads and invade homes in Fort Bend, Wharton and Brazoria
counties.
</P>
<P>
   The Montgomery County search got under way Tuesday afternoon
with sheriff's deputies aided by boats and a helicopter. The man
they were seeking reportedly had been with Beverly Kay Caldwell
when the pickup truck he was driving was washed off the bridge on
Cypress-Rosehill Road about 2:30 a.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell's body was recovered at 6 a.m. Monday from the cab of
the truck, which had come to rest against a tree.
</P>
<P>
   A witness who had pulled his vehicle to the side of the road
just short of the bridge told investigators that he last saw the
man standing on top of the truck as it moved downstream.
</P>
<P>
   The witness said the pickup passed him at a rather high speed
before plowing through the water ahead, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's Deputy Bob Schuster, a marine division officer who
recovered Caldwell's body, estimated that the current was moving at
40 mph when the truck was swamped. That would not bode well for the
chances of Caldwell's companion surviving, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a current that strong in the black of night, he could
have been swept down the creek for miles,'' Schuster said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Red Cross workers closed a shelter at New Caney
Middle School in east Montgomery County after the last evacuees had
left. The flood-prone Peach and Caney creeks, the San Jacinto River
and the East Fork of the river had displaced many residents Sunday
and Monday, but the water was slowly retreating Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Classes are expected to resume Wednesday in the New Caney and
Splendora school districts, which had canceled school on Monday and
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The forecast for the Houston area Wednesday calls for a 20
percent chance of showers.
</P>
<P>
   In Harris County, creeks were beginning to recede although some
areas may see high water for a couple of more days, said Steve
Fitzgerald, chief engineer for the county flood control district.
</P>
<P>
   Several roads in far northwest Harris County _ including
Katy-Hockley Road and Mueschke Road _ will remain underwater for a
few days as the water continues to drain into the upper reaches of
Cypress Creek, Fitzgerald said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Gutierrez, operations coordinator for Harris County
Emergency Management, said the San Jacinto River is expected to
crest at the U.S. 59 bridge Wednesday at 55.5 feet. It was at 55
feet Tuesday afternoon _ 5 feet above flood stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the danger is out of the way now,'' Gutierrez said.
</P>
<P>
   Two areas that could see higher water in the next few days,
however, are Rio Villa Park and Banana Bend, both on the San
Jacinto River south of Lake Houston. Many homes there are built on
stilts, but Gutierrez said about 100 residents were removed by boat
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The San Jacinto also remained a stubborn intruder in northeast
Harris County's Forest Cove area, where many residents moved
possessions to higher ground Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A small group at a townhouse development on Hamblen Road stayed
home from work and stood guard near their community's private
entrance.
</P>
<P>
   As if there weren't enough problems, they were annoyed that
sightseers were driving through the water, creating waves that
pushed into homes.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the ants and the snakes _ and outsiders who
aroused suspicion among residents who had lost property to looters
in the October 1994 flood.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Fire Department had evacuated five people in the
area as of Tuesday, but Chief Steven Sparks said many residents
were not alarmed and didn't want to leave.
</P>
<P>
   To the east, in Liberty County, residents kept a close watch on
the Trinity River, which is expected to crest in the next two days.
</P>
<P>
   The Lake Livingston dam floodgates were releasing 26,200 cubic
feet per second on Tuesday, which is 6,200 cfs above flood stage,
said Trinity River Authority spokesman Spencer Karr.
</P>
<P>
   ``But our lake seems to have stabilized and I don't think it
will rise much more than that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Liberty, the river was at 21.5 feet and rising, but still
under flood stage of 24 feet, officials reported.
</P>
<P>
   With the runoff from the heavy rains, the National Weather
Service projected that the river could crest at 25 or 26 feet,
which would not flood any homes but would submerge entry roads into
17 riverside subdivisions.
</P>
<P>
   To the west and southwest of Houston, residents of low-lying
areas along the Brazos and San Bernard rivers in Fort Bend and
Brazoria counties were preparing to leave their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Evacuations were recommended in the Valley Lodge community in
Simonton and also in the 30-home Tierra Grande subdivision outside
Needville, near the San Bernard River.
</P>
<P>
   On the west side of the San Bernard, in Wharton County,
officials had evacuated about 75 people Tuesday and planned more
Wednesday in anticipation of a flood that could exceed the record
flood of December 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they expect the Colorado River to crest at 50 to
52 feet Thursday, which might bring water up to the doors of the
county's new jail and its old courthouse building in nearby
downtown Wharton.
</P>
<P>
   Flood stage in Wharton is 39 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we have people who have been warned and who are
waiting to leave,'' said Chief Deputy Bill Copeland. ``We have been
evacuating people since Sunday and a majority of the people are
using their heads and getting out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the old-timers will say they're not worried, but
it's coming this time, and it's likely to be 4 foot higher than the
record flood we had in 1991.''
</P>
<P>
   Many evacuees had left the Elm Grove area Saturday night.
Residents of Wharton's west end saw water spill out of Baumann's
Slough and lap across low-lying portions of their neighborhood.

IMPEACHMENT DEADLINE DEPENDS ON WHITE HOUSE, HYDE SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Ark., Tenn., Calif.)  (Eds: See also CLINTON-JONES) 
(mk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee said
Tuesday that his goal of finishing the impeachment investigation of
President Clinton by the end of the year was ``all dependent on
whether there's reasonable cooperation from the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., placed the burden on the
White House to avoid a protracted investigation just a day before
Charles Ruff, the White House counsel; David Kendall, Clinton's
private lawyer, and Gregory Craig, a White House special counsel,
were to meet Republican and Democratic lawyers and investigators
from the committee spearheading the impeachment investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be able to ascertain the level of cooperation, which
will be interesting to us,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks appeared to be part of a strategy both sides are
adopting, to present themselves as ready to move quickly through
the hearings, but keeping open the possibility that the other side
would be responsible for any delays.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting on Wednesday marks the first effort by committee
staff members and the White House to set ground rules and
procedures since the House voted to open a formal impeachment
inquiry into Clinton's efforts to disguise the nature of his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky. David Schippers, the Republican
investigative counsel for the House Judiciary Committee, has said
there is credible evidence that Clinton may have committed perjury,
abused the power of his office and obstructed justice.
</P>
<P>
   The sides are to discuss what rights and privileges the
president's lawyers will have to question witnesses, sit in on
depositions and participate in closed sessions of the committee.
During the Watergate investigation of President Nixon 24 years ago,
the White House counsel was granted broad power to question
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The parties are also expected to explore how much of the
evidence submitted to Congress by Kenneth Starr, the independent
counsel, the White House will contest. That could help determine
how many witnesses the committee will independently depose and for
how long.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in favor of a process that is not a partisan process,''
said Craig, one of the White House lawyers, ``that is one that
everyone can see is fair and even-handed.'' He added, ``We do
believe that would include a consideration by the full committee of
the constitutional standard that should be employed to determine
whether or not the conduct at issue is at the level of an
impeachable offense.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting takes place in the shadow of the midterm elections,
and both sides are expected to step gingerly because of the
political stakes. A Republican committee staff member said the
lawyers were approaching the meeting ``like the Russians and United
States in the Cold War, with good reason to be cautious because
neither side wants the other side to use their weaponry.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said the committee was still working out which witnesses it
would call.
</P>
<P>
   With political strategists predicting that the midterm elections
are unlikely to give Republicans a sweeping mandate, some Judiciary
Committee members said November's election results should not be a
factor in committee deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to resist trying to apply the elections results to
the committee,'' said Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark. ``If you turn it
around, you could say an overwhelming Republican victory should
give impetus to impeachment, and I think that would be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But many House members acknowledged that the impeachment
proceedings would only be put on an even keel once the political
verdict of the elections was assessed, and the imperatives of both
parties to fire up their partisans were finally put aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, the rhetoric has been raised to a pretty high level
right now,'' said Rep. Bill Jenkins, R-Tenn. ``We need to let this
election cycle pass and let things calm down.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless Republicans achieve a large sweep in the House,
strategists and aides in both political parties say that
Republicans and Democrats alike will have reason to shy away from a
drawn-out inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody would like to move it along,'' Hyde said.
``But we have to do it appropriately. We don't want to rush to a
conclusion that hasn't been well thought out.'' Some Republicans
said the House would have to weigh carefully whether to pursue
articles of impeachment against Clinton if it appeared that the
Senate lacked the votes to convict him.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are starting to voice concerns that they could suffer
if either they or the president are perceived as drawing out the
impeachment proceedings into a long public spectacle featuring a
parade of witnesses from Starr to Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said, ``Everybody is going to have
to do the best job that can be done to keep this from being a
donnybrook that's unacceptable to the public.''

DESIGNING A LIBRARY FOR THE LEAST PRIVATE PRESIDENT 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 25)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some weeks ago an article appeared in this newspaper in which
various people were asked to comment on how presidential libraries
should deal with embarrassing episodes in an administration's
record. As I recall, no one suggested that the embarrassing episode
should be the major focus of such institutions. But maybe that's
the way to go.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Nixon Library, for instance, could have adopted as
its mission the creation of a public forum on paranoia. There could
have been a Bush Library of Weird Locutions, a Kennedy Library of
Shady Connections, a Carter Library of the Malaise of Power.
</P>
<P>
   Is it too late to propose a Clinton Library of Indiscretion? For
that matter, do we need to call it a library? We already have a
National Archives in Washington for storing presidential books and
papers pertaining to the public record. Wouldn't it be more useful
to create centers for the study of cultural issues that a
presidency throws into relief?
</P>
<P>
   Joost Elffers, a Dutch graphic designer who conceived the
picture book ``Play With Your Food,'' remarked recently that if you
grew up in a mansion, or a Hyannisport-like compound, you could
probably figure out at an early age how to get some privacy.
</P>
<P>
   But if you were raised, say, in a trailer, where at night you
had to pull a piece of cloth across a string, you might have quite
a different conception of solitude. In most parts of the world the
question ``Were you alone?'' would be an occasion for
uncontrollable mirth. We ought to laugh at it also.
</P>
<P>
   For social space in the modern world may well consist, as the
sociologist Norbert Elias suggests, in the recognition that a self,
unlike a body, is not bounded by the skin; that there is no clear
distinction between the individual and society; that we are at all
times invaded by ideas, perceptions, emotions and demands from the
social environment; and that this environment is subject to the
thoughts, words and actions of individuals as well.
</P>
<P>
   Such ideas have driven architecture throughout the 20th century.
Frank Lloyd Wright's use of the open floor plan and corner windows,
his elimination of basements and attics, blurred the borders that
traditionally contained individual privacy.
</P>
<P>
   In his de Stijl Manifesto, Theo van Doesburg called for designs
that would strike ``an equal balance between the individual and the
universal,'' an ambition that Gerrit Rietveld hoped to achieve by
using abstract geometric forms in projects like the Schroeder House
in Utrecht.
</P>
<P>
   Mies van der Rohe's glass curtain walls and free-standing
partitions further eroded the distinction between interior and
exterior. He used I-beams to express the building's steel-frame
structure on its facade, a device taken to baroque extremes by
Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers in their ``exoskeletal'' design for
the Pompidou Center in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Eric Owen Moss, Frank Gehry and Rem Koolhaas have
used flamboyantly subjective forms to challenge architecture's
traditional appeal to external authority. Elizabeth Diller and
Ricardo Scofidio have incorporated surveillance cameras and video
screens into their work.
</P>
<P>
   But glass walls, the open plan and idiosyncratic shapes are only
part of the story. In her book ``Privacy and Publicity'' (MIT
Press), the historian Beatriz Colomina argues (at exasperating
length) that modernism is ``the publicity of the private.''
</P>
<P>
   Using Le Corbusier as a case study, she explores the extent to
which he was inspired by photography, advertising and other media
techniques, and used them to promote his vision in journals, books
and pamphlets, in which buildings served as illustrations. Private
houses, like the Villa Stein at Garches, became public images, to
be replicated by others, either physically or in the mind.
</P>
<P>
   The public airing of private lives didn't begin with Jenny Jones
and Sally Jesse Raphael, in other words. Long before talk shows, Le
Corbusier grasped the power of the media to turn architecture
inside-out. The media are doing something similar to politics.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's televised grand jury turned the president inside out,
and the same thing is likely to happen to members of the House
Judiciary Committee. Who will show self-awareness? Who will try to
hide behind stone facades that everyone else can see through? (The
Clarence Thomas hearings offered a preview of what's in store.)
</P>
<P>
   And while we're reconceptualizing the presidential library, we
might as well end the suspense over which architect will design it.
Actually, there's no need for an architect. We can buy some old
Airstreams and put in some desks, chairs and computers. They could
travel around the country in a convoy, set up camp in shopping mall
parking lots. Inner-city vacant lots. Fallow farm fields.
Small-town squares.
</P>
<P>
   Or they could split up to form mobile video studios. They could
pull into a whole street of private driveways unannounced, like
Publishers Clearing House, and broadcast live video feeds of
neighborhood life to pay-per-view cable channels.
</P>
<P>
   Some trailers could have real people living in them, the way
Loretta Young lived for a week in that department store window on
her 50s television show. Others could have mimes pretending to be
wax figures. There could be a tableau vivant of Walter Annenberg's
remarks on being presented to Queen Elizabeth: ``We are living in
the embassy residence, of course, subject to some of the
discomfiture as a result of the need for elements of refurbishment
and rehabilitation.''
</P>
<P>
   Another trailer could be devoted to the semiotics of the term
``trailer trash,'' the relationship between privacy and class and
the exploration of alternative concepts, like New Urbanism trash,
Hamptons trash and cell phone trash.
</P>
<P>
   Or there could be online access to the literature and visual art
forms that have traced the waving contours of the line between
public and private. The four-volume ``A History of Private Life''
by Philippe Aries and George Duby. ``Ulysses.'' ``Mrs. Dalloway.''
``Civilization and its Discontents.'' Weegee's photographs. Ozzie
and Harriet. Gilbert and George. ``When Push Comes to Shove.''
</P>
<P>
   With these flexible arrangements, the Clinton Library could
demonstrate as well as document the interaction of public and
private affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Elias used the term ``homo clausus'' to describe the
misconception of the individual self as a core within a shell that
separates inside from outside. (The Unabomber could be an extreme
manifestation of this idea and its deluded consequences.) His book,
``The Civilizing Process,'' argues in favor of the open personality
who is ``fundamentally oriented toward and dependent on other
people throughout his life.''
</P>
<P>
   We don't need a homo clausus type of presidential library, just
as people don't really want a homo clausus president. We may flinch
from revelations of presidential indiscretions, but at the same
time we've gained as a society from getting rid of the fear and
manipulation that were sustained by oppressive notions of the
indiscreet.
</P>
<P>
   Architecture, an art that has often supported that oppression,
has also been part of the process of shedding it during this
century. If architecture is called for in the building of a new
presidential library, there's a lot more shedding to be done.

FOUR DRUG GIANTS REPORT PROFIT GAINS IN THIRD QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four of the world's largest drug makers reported higher profits
Tuesday for the third quarter, thanks largely to sales of new drugs
and to direct-to-consumer advertising campaigns that bolstered
sales of older products.
</P>
<P>
   While all four companies were encouraged by their profit gains,
their performances were anything but equal. Profits at
Schering-Plough, one of the industry's hottest companies, rose 22
percent, to $432 million, or 58 cents a diluted share, compared
with $353 million, or 48 cents a share, in the quarter a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   It was a penny above analysts' expectations measured by the
First Call Corp., which tracks earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies have had such a boom this year in sales that
earnings gains of 20 percent are now regarded as average. Analysts
have applauded any company that topped that mark, which only two
have done so far in the third quarter: Schering-Plough and
Warner-Lambert, whose profit was up up 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Eli Lilly is expected to post a 30 percent third-quarter
earnings gain Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Only one other company that reported earnings Tuesday earned
praise from analysts. Bristol-Myers Squibb, buoyed by sales of its
cholesterol-reducer Pravachol and its diabetes drug Glucophage,
posted a 13 percent gain in net income, to $966 million, or 95
cents a share, up from $855 million, or 84 cents a share, in the
quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The gain matched the consensus of forecasts by analysts, who
have come to regard Bristol-Myers Squibb as one of the industry's
most consistent earnings performers.
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products and London-based SmithKline Beecham,
which have three aborted mergers between them this year, including
one with each other, have not performed as robustly as competitors.
Profits at American Home Products rose 12 percent, to $619 million,
or 46 cents a share, compared with $552.5 million, or 42 cents a
share, in the quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   SmithKline reported a 10 percent gain in net income, to $441
million, or 40 cents an American depository receipt, up from $401
million, or 37 cents. Both companies' earnings gains matched
analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have passed over the industry's hot companies in
recent weeks to snap up shares of steady performers. Tuesday was no
different. Despite its 22 percent earnings gain, Schering-Plough's
shares dropped $1.9375, or 1.9 percent, to $98.50.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb, meanwhile, increased 68.75
cents, to $105.6875, while SmithKline Beecham's American depository
receipts jumped 3.2 percent, to $57.375.
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products' stock held steady near $50 a share
throughout most of Tuesday until investors began to take profits in
the early afternoon. In the last three hours of trading, its shares
fell $3.9375, or 7.8 percent, to $46.1875.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors know that when the economy goes bad, they can still
depend on the drug industry's most dependable stocks, Johnson &AMP;
Johnson and Bristol-Myers Squibb,'' said David Saks, managing
director at Gruntal &AMP; Co. ``They may be wondering if
Schering-Plough and Warner-Lambert can keep up such huge gains. And
I think the answer is yes.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Tuesday's stock blips especially captured the
imaginations of analysts. Of particular interest was SmithKline
Beecham's 3.2 percent gain in American depository receipts on a
third-quarter performance that was lackluster at best.
</P>
<P>
   There were two views on investor enthusiasm. Jan Leschly, the
chairman of SmithKline, said the company had strong sales from
several of its products, including Paxil, its popular
antidepressant.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street had another thought. Analysts said investors were
reacting to speculation that Leschly might soon leave the company,
a move that could open the door for another merger opportunity.
That thought did not sit well with Leschly, who stressed to
reporters Tuesday that he had no intentions of leaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of rumors that I may retire early,'' he said
Tuesday in an interview. ``It is absolutely not true. This is
entirely a UK issue, started by the UK press. People just write too
much here in the UK.''

 &HT;    Customers surprised nice teller stole from them
 &HT;    By Scott Hiaasen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH _ Phyllis Richardson has been described as a
solicitous thief, the bank teller who fostered a ``lovefest'' with
her elderly customers while she methodically siphoned money from
their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's the image depicted by federal prosecutors on
Tuesday, when Richardson's trial began on 41 charges of
embezzlement, money laundering and mail fraud. They say Richardson,
37, stole between $1.2 million and $1.5 million over seven years
from 16 of her customers at the Community Savings Bank on Singer
Island, including a 92-year-old woman who once lived with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was cheerful, always very good with people,'' Assistant
U.S. Attorney Neil Karadbil told jurors. ``Most of the customers
enjoyed the attention. Even today, some of the customers find it
hard to believe she would take money out of their accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   But Richardson's lawyers are challenging her portrayal as a
cunning swindler _ and in so doing, they're putting her intellect
on trial.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Arthur Addess said Richardson simply isn't bright
enough to pull off such a scheme. Could a lifelong C student with
an IQ of 81 successfully deceive bank officers and customers for
years by shuffling money from account to account? Could Richardson,
a woman who has trouble paying her utility bills, continue to
befuddle authorities who are still unsure where all the money went?
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to have to ask yourself when we show you this
whether Phyllis Richardson had the intellect and the capacity to
pull off this $1.5 million scheme,'' Addess told jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Karadbil said the scheme was clever in some ways, simple in
others. Richardson, he said, set up certificates of deposit worth
less money than her customers intended and hid the difference. She
also drained their accounts in small withdrawals and disguised the
transactions with forged paperwork, Karadbil said.
</P>
<P>
   The transactions typically involved accounts for which the bank
did not produce monthly statements, but they were done under
Richardson's employee code, Karadbil said. The money was ``washed''
through separate accounts set up under the names of Richardson's
friends or sisters, then converted to cash, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme unraveled after one woman abruptly closed her account
and noticed the differences, he said. Richardson, of West Palm
Beach, was indicted in November 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence is expected to get technical, and prosecutors have
outfitted the courtroom with computer monitors and a projector to
guide the jury through a litany of bank records. The trial is
expected to last about three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But Addess said the ``truck load'' of documents is nothing more
than trial by saturation, an attempt to overwhelm the jurors with
information.
</P>
<P>
   He also said Richardson could have concealed her employee code
if she were the thief, and noted that she's not living like a
millionaire _ she's filed for bankruptcy, her car has been
repossessed, her home is in foreclosure and she once had to borrow
$300 from one of her alleged victims to pay her electric bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't let the amounts of money overwhelm you. Don't let the
frailty of the elderly people gain your sympathy,'' he said.

 &HT;    In eleventh hour of campaigning, voters watch ad war unfold
 &HT;    By Debra Jasper
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ With two weeks left to Election Day, the two
major party candidates for governor have brushed aside any talk of
an ad truce, and are instead bringing out the heavy artillery.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Democrat Lee Fisher's campaign unveiled a television
ad that thrashes Republican Bob Taft for his commercial on Fisher's
crime-fighting record _ a commercial that brought Taft's campaign a
rebuke from the Ohio Elections Commission for containing false and
misleading information.
</P>
<P>
   The Taft campaign fired back, accusing Fisher's camp of
similarly misleading the public with an ad on tax cutting proposals
, although Taft's accusation won't be heard by the Elections
Commission until today.
</P>
<P>
   The new Fisher ad says that for the first time in Ohio history,
the bi-partisan Elections Commission has found a candidate for
governor ``guilty of lying . . . Robert Taft's campaign knowingly
aired lies and broke Ohio election law,'' an announcer says. ``The
same laws Taft, as Ohio's chief election officer, is sworn to
enforce.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad shows a gavel slamming down and displays recent headlines
from across the state: ``Taft ads violated state law, panel says;
Board rules ads for Taft are false; Taft commercial ruled
untruthful; Taft camp scolded for TV ad.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher's campaign manager, Alan Melamed, also handed out a
document that showed Taft's ad ran several times statewide over the
weekend, despite the Taft campaign's assertion Friday that it would
be immediately taken off the air and replaced by a positive ad.
</P>
<P>
   Taft has a ``reckless disregard for the truth,'' Melamed said.
``Bob Taft is bringing shame to the Taft name.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett Buerck, Taft's spokesman, was quick to hit back, saying,
``Name calling and petty, cheap shots are exactly the type of
negative, nasty comments that voters are tired of.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it's not the campaign's fault the ads weren't pulled,
that most station managers go home on Friday afternoon and didn't
see the request to pull the ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the TV news stations, this is not life and death,'' Buerck
said. ``There is no sense of urgency for these news stations to
change the ad. They get their money anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Buerck, meanwhile, accused the Fisher campaign of lying in a
current ad that says Fisher is the only candidate with a plan to
cut property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher has proposed giving Ohio homeowners another 15 percent
reduction on their property taxes by expanding the portion the
state pays from 12.5 percent to 27.5 percent. In the first two
years, the plan would cost Ohio $1.1 billion. Taft criticized that
plan as irresponsible and a day later proposed a modest plan of his
own that would cut property taxes for about 25,000 middle-income
retirees and disabled homeowners by an extra $53 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so hypocritical of these guys to criticize our guys on
one hand and do the same thing on the other hand,'' Buerck said.
</P>
<P>
   The Elections Commission today is expected to rule on whether
there is probable cause the Fisher ad is misleading.
</P>
<P>
   It also will rule on whether there is probable cause that
another Taft ad misleads voters by using a partial quote from a
Cleveland Plain Dealer story to support a contention that Taft did
not raise taxes when he was a Hamilton County Commissioner. Taft
voted to put 14 tax increases on the ballot during that time, and
says he probably voted for them privately in the voting booth, but
says that's not the same as voting as an elected official to raise
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Melamed claimed Taft is following the same strategy he followed
during a 1990 campaign for the Republican nomination for governor
against George Voinovich. Taft started out running negative ads and
criticizing Voinovich for supporting tax increases _ including
taxes Voinovich didn't vote to enact himself, Melamed said. Taft
then proposed a ban on negative campaigning, a ban similar to the
one he proposed to Fisher on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Tuesday, Taft acknowledged such a ban is not

 &HT;    In eleventh hour of campaigning, voters watch ad war unfold
 &HT;    By Debra Jasper
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ With two weeks left to Election Day, the two
major party candidates for governor have brushed aside any talk of
an ad truce, and are instead bringing out the heavy artillery.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Democrat Lee Fisher's campaign unveiled a television
ad that thrashes Republican Bob Taft for his commercial on Fisher's
crime-fighting record _ a commercial that brought Taft's campaign a
rebuke from the Ohio Elections Commission for containing false and
misleading information.
</P>
<P>
   The Taft campaign fired back, accusing Fisher's camp of
similarly misleading the public with an ad on tax cutting proposals
, although Taft's accusation won't be heard by the Elections
Commission until today.
</P>
<P>
   The new Fisher ad says that for the first time in Ohio history,
the bi-partisan Elections Commission has found a candidate for
governor ``guilty of lying . . . Robert Taft's campaign knowingly
aired lies and broke Ohio election law,'' an announcer says. ``The
same laws Taft, as Ohio's chief election officer, is sworn to
enforce.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad shows a gavel slamming down and displays recent headlines
from across the state: ``Taft ads violated state law, panel says;
Board rules ads for Taft are false; Taft commercial ruled
untruthful; Taft camp scolded for TV ad.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher's campaign manager, Alan Melamed, also handed out a
document that showed Taft's ad ran several times statewide over the
weekend, despite the Taft campaign's assertion Friday that it would
be immediately taken off the air and replaced by a positive ad.
</P>
<P>
   Taft has a ``reckless disregard for the truth,'' Melamed said.
``Bob Taft is bringing shame to the Taft name.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett Buerck, Taft's spokesman, was quick to hit back, saying,
``Name calling and petty, cheap shots are exactly the type of
negative, nasty comments that voters are tired of.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it's not the campaign's fault the ads weren't pulled,
that most station managers go home on Friday afternoon and didn't
see the request to pull the ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the TV news stations, this is not life and death,'' Buerck
said. ``There is no sense of urgency for these news stations to
change the ad. They get their money anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Buerck, meanwhile, accused the Fisher campaign of lying in a
current ad that says Fisher is the only candidate with a plan to
cut property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher has proposed giving Ohio homeowners another 15 percent
reduction on their property taxes by expanding the portion the
state pays from 12.5 percent to 27.5 percent. In the first two
years, the plan would cost Ohio $1.1 billion. Taft criticized that
plan as irresponsible and a day later proposed a modest plan of his
own that would cut property taxes for about 25,000 middle-income
retirees and disabled homeowners by an extra $53 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so hypocritical of these guys to criticize our guys on
one hand and do the same thing on the other hand,'' Buerck said.
</P>
<P>
   The Elections Commission today is expected to rule on whether
there is probable cause the Fisher ad is misleading.
</P>
<P>
   It also will rule on whether there is probable cause that
another Taft ad misleads voters by using a partial quote from a
Cleveland Plain Dealer story to support a contention that Taft did
not raise taxes when he was a Hamilton County Commissioner. Taft
voted to put 14 tax increases on the ballot during that time, and
says he probably voted for them privately in the voting booth, but
says that's not the same as voting as an elected official to raise
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Melamed claimed Taft is following the same strategy he followed
during a 1990 campaign for the Republican nomination for governor
against George Voinovich. Taft started out running negative ads and
criticizing Voinovich for supporting tax increases _ including
taxes Voinovich didn't vote to enact himself, Melamed said. Taft
then proposed a ban on negative campaigning, a ban similar to the
one he proposed to Fisher on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Tuesday, Taft acknowledged such a ban is not
going anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on Lee Fisher's actions over the last four days, a
campaign free of negative, nasty ads is likely out of the realm of
possibility,'' he said.

850 HOMES EVACUATED AS TEXAS FLOODWATERS SURGE THROUGH SOUTHWEST 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VICTORIA, Texas _ Hundreds of people were evacuated from their
homes Tuesday, including many who had refused to leave and then
fled as floodwaters surged through their neighborhoods when the
Guadalupe River spilled over its banks.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria County Judge Helen Walker said more than 850 homes were
evacuated and estimates the damage will be in the hundreds of
millions of dollars. Though evacuations began as early as Sunday,
she said no one anticipated the extent of flooding witnessed
Tuesday, where portions of the river were more than four miles wide
north of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting water where we've never had it before,'' she
said. ``We're already three feet above the flood record in 1936 so
we have a whole new flood line.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Texas Sen. Ken Armbrister, D-Victoria, who was at the
evacuation site Tuesday: ``I've lived here 30 years and was the
police captain here before I was a state legislator. This is the
largest volume of water I have ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The river was expected to crest by this morning after rising to
34.26 feet Tuesday afternoon. Walker said the water level recorded
by city survey crews fluctuated most of the day over the record
31.3 foot level.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns centered on whether the river would crest a second time
when more water was expected to come from further upstream where
more than 20 inches of rain swelled rivers and creeks in and around
San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   By late Tuesday, the waterline stood within two blocks of
downtown Victoria, about 125 miles southwest of Houston. Downtown
Victoria remained without power on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   National Guard units were arriving to assist Victoria police in
maintaining a 7 p.m. curfew to prevent looting. Other concerns
include health problems, primarily from the city water treatment
plant, which was partially submerged and had to be shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said the county will seek federal disaster assistance
once flood waters recede and damage can be assessed.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Tuesday was spent evacuating residents who earlier had
refused help, intent on waiting out the flood. U.S. Coast Guard and
Texas National Guard helicopters rescued people trapped on their
roofs or in treetops, including one woman and a child whose roof
was swept from underneath them. They were found unharmed downstream
clinging to tree branches.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said as many as 50 residents remained in the flooded
areas, refusing to be evacuated, including some who waved off
helicopters from second story windows with the floor below filled
with water. She said one man, apparently undeterred by the rising
water, was found barbecuing on his roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really had pleaded with people to take this seriously; that
this is a life and death situation,'' she said. ``If another two
feet comes up I don't know if they're going to be all right or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Before going to work Tuesday morning, Nick Ruiz Jr., 33, said he
drove a mile west from his home toward the river to inspect the
flooding. An hour and a half later, he returned home after his wife
called to tell him the water was entering their back yard.

   Questions and answers on the waste proposal
</P>
<P>
   By Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why is a disposal site under consideration for Texas?
</P>
<P>
   A .1980 federal law urges states to take responsibility for
waste generated within their borders. The Texas Legislature decided
in 1981 that the state would build a disposal site. In 1993,
lawmakers revised the plan to include waste from Maine and Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What are the advantages of the Sierra Blanca location?
</P>
<P>
   A. It is remote, sparsely populated and dry. The site receives
about 12 inches of rain a year, and groundwater lies 700 feet deep
_ conditions that presumably would help guard against water
contamination.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why is the site controversial?
</P>
<P>
   A. It is 18 miles from the Rio Grande, a major water source and
the U.S.-Mexico border. Residents of the area are primarily
low-income and Hispanic. There is a geologic fault beneath the
site, and the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Texas
occurred about 60 miles southeast in Valentine in 1931.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Who would run the site?
</P>
<P>
   A. state agency, the Texas Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal
Authority. A separate eight-member interstate compact commission
with representatives from Texas, Maine and Vermont would oversee
the operation. The governor of Texas would appoint six of the eight
members, and one of those six would have to be from Hudspeth
County. Maine and Vermont would each name one member.
</P>
<P>
   Q. President Clinton recently signed legislation concerning the
plan. Doesn't that end the debate?
</P>
<P>
   A. No. Clinton approved a measure creating the interstate
compact. The state disposal authority still needs a license from
the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission. The commission
is to consider the license request Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is an interstate compact, and why are two New England
states in a compact with Texas?
</P>
<P>
   A. An interstate compact is a congressionally approved agreement
between or among states. Low-level waste compacts legally may
exclude waste from nonmember states. Texas originally planned to
develop a site without a compact, then decided to enter into a
partnership with Maine and Vermont when those states agreed to pay
a total of $55 million -- $50 million to Texas for site development
and $5 million to the host county for community assistance
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How is the conservation commission expected to rule?
</P>
<P>
   A. Unclear. The three-member commission could grant a license,
deny the request, take the matter under advisement or send the case
back to administrative law judges to gather more evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What did the administrative law judges recommend?
</P>
<P>
   A. Denial of the license. Two judges with the state Office of
Administrative Hearings said the waste authority had failed to
adequately examine the geologic fault beneath the site and the
potential socioeconomic effects of the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can the conservation commission's decision be appealed?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. A party in the case would first have to seek a rehearing
by the conservation commission. An appeal subsequently could be
filed in state district court in Travis County.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Could the site become a national dumping ground for low-level
waste?
</P>
<P>
   A. Perhaps. State and federal laws allow _ but do not require _
the compact commission to accept waste from other states. But the
decision would be up to Texas because it controls six of eight
seats on the compact commission. In addition, the terms of a
license issued by the conservation commission could require a
license amendment and the state Legislature's approval before waste
from other states is accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is the site needed?
</P>
<P>
   A. Three privately owned sites _ at Barnwell, S.C.; Clive, Utah;
and Richland, Wash. _ currently accept commercially generated
low-level waste, with the Barnwell site taking waste from Texas and
most other states. Capacity and access are adequate for now, but
long-term prospects are uncertain. Several new sites are in
planning stages around the nation, but not all will be needed to
handle the volume generated.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What are the sources of the waste that would be shipped to
the Texas site?
</P>
<P>
   A. Nuclear power plants, medical facilities, industrial concerns
and universities. Nuclear plants generate about 70 percent of the
volume and radioactivity.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How would waste be transported?
</P>
<P>
   A. By truck. Waste would be packaged in steel drums, steel boxes
and ``high-integrity containers.'' The latter are steel cylinders
with fiberglass on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How much would the site cost, and who would pay for it?
</P>
<P>
   A. The project has cost $53 million so far for engineering,
geological studies, legal fees and other expenses. The disposal
authority bills waste generators in Texas for the tab. The
authority predicts total costs of $91 million, including $36
million for construction. Maine and Vermont are to pay $25 million
each. Q. Who supports the proposed disposal site?
</P>
<P>
   A. STP Nuclear Operating Co., Houston Lighting &AMP; Power Co.,
Texas Utilities Electric Co., Advocates for Responsible Disposal in
Texas, South Texas Chapter of the Health Physics Society, Texas
Radiation Advisory Board, executive director of the Texas Natural
Resource Conservation Commission, and Mexico's ministries of
environment, foreign relations and energy.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Who is opposed?
</P>
<P>
   A. Sierra Blanca Legal Defense Fund, Greenpeace Mexico, Texas &AMP;
Pacific Land Trust, Border Environmental Network, Sierra Club's El
Paso Group, International Environmental Alliance of the Bravo,
League of United Latin American Citizens, City of Austin, City of
El Paso, El Paso County, Presidio County, Culberson County, Ciudad
Juarez, Mexico's Congress, public interest counsel of the Texas
Natural Resource Conservation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What are other states doing?
</P>
<P>
   A. California has licensed a proposed disposal site at Ward
Valley in San Bernardino County, but it is stalled because the
federal government has refused to transfer land to the state. State
regulators have recommended denial of a license for a site in
Nebraska. North Carolina has selected a site, but licensing is
stalled by financial issues. Pennsylvania and New Jersey have
suspended their search for a site. Connecticut and Illinois have
not selected a site.

 &HT;    Cuero hammered by flood
 &HT;    By Dylan Rivera
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Four cows huddled on the roof of a house on
Heaton Street, buried Tuesday under 14 feet of water. Adventurous
boaters and rescue workers chugged along the southwest half of this
town, which has been choked by the unrelenting waters of the
Guadalupe River for two days.
</P>
<P>
   Rushing waters forced 4,000 of Cuero's 7,000 residents to seek
shelter at the town's two schools, in their cars or in hotels as
far away as Hallettsville, about 60 miles away, DeWitt County
Sheriff Cliff Foulds said. ``Very few homes don't have house guests
right now, the hotels are filled and people are camping out,''
Foulds said.
</P>
<P>
   In a preliminary report to disaster officials in Austin Monday,
DeWitt County officials estimated that 300 homes had been
destroyed, up to 1,000 more had sustained major flood damage and
500 others had sustained minor damage.
</P>
<P>
   A mile northeast of Cuero at the Stevenson prison, where 1,300
convicts and about 150 guards had been stranded overnight by
floodwaters , officials decided to stay put after evacuation
efforts were stymied.
</P>
<P>
   By afternoon, prison officials said, a National Guard helicopter
had delivered a pump that was being used to drain the prison's
flooded sewage-treatment plant. As the floodwaters began to drop,
convict work crews were busy with squeegees and mops cleaning out
the mud and water.
</P>
<P>
   In downtown Cuero, worried residents wandered up and down
Esplanade, the boulevard that divides the town into east and west,
hoping to hitch a boat ride to inspect their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Gottschalt, a construction contractor, discovered that
the flooding spared his house, on a ridge near the river. But he
knows many people, including his elderly mother, who lost their
homes and will need government disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can borrow money if I have to, but a lot of these people
here, they can't borrow nothing because they don't have nothing,''
Gottschalt said.
</P>
<P>
   Some families in the more affluent Northwood Estates subdivision
on the city's north side saw houses flooded up to 3 feet deep but
could drive up to their homes by Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteeen-year-old Emily Morrow rummaged through a jumble of
sheet music, grade-school homework assignments and toys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to take my diaries, but I didn't get all of them,''
she said before turning back to the mess in her closet.
</P>
<P>
   Frustration turned to anger for some weary, wet residents. Many
who live on the south and west sides of town said they have been
frustrated for years by poor drainage and inadequate road
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Watching men from other parts of town cruise through their
neighborhoods in fishing boats only made some more frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to let me have that boat,'' Herbie Bryant said. ``I
know the way, but I don't got no boat because I'm a poor man.''

 &HT;    History of leaks a subject of debate
 &HT;    By Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The low-level radioactive waste disposal site in
Maxey Flats, Ky., was declared a federal Superfund site because of
leaking waste.
</P>
<P>
   At a similar site in Illinois, radioactive tritium flowed into
groundwater. The same thing happened in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the proposed radioactive waste disposal site in
West Texas say leaks at the nation's six current and former
radioactive waste sites should serve as a warning against building
one in this state.
</P>
<P>
   But agencies that monitor those facilities say the leaks have
been controlled or reduced and have posed no threat to human
health.
</P>
<P>
   At the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Jim Kennedy, senior
project manager for low-level waste disposal, said that in decades
past, waste sites were poorly located and regulated. Some were
built in areas with heavy rainfall, and rainwater saturated the
trenches where 55-gallon drums contained liquid waste were buried.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened in Maxey Flats, which closed in 1977, and a
facility in West Valley, N.Y., that closed in 1975. At a defunct
disposal site in the Nevada desert, leaking drums are the most
likely culprit for tritium detected in the surrounding soil,
Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Tritium, a radioactive form of hydrogen that mingles easily with
water, also has migrated out of trenches at the nation's two active
waste facilities, in Barnwell, S.C., and Richland, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, Kennedy said, the contamination is below the
government's allowable limit for human exposure. The leaks prompted
new federal regulations for low-level sites in 1983 that forbid
burial of liquids, require improved storage containers and impose a
long list of restrictions on where disposal sites can be located.
</P>
<P>
   Those new regulations helped shape the proposed Texas site,
which would be located near Sierra Blanca in arid Hudspeth County
and would use reinforced concrete canisters to contain solid waste.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents, who contend that politics, not science, decided
where to place the proposed Texas site, say the state is risking a
repeat of history.

 &HT;    Plan for radioactive cargo: Inspect every truck
 &HT;    By Ralph K.M. Haurwitz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Low-level radioactive waste is routinely
transported without incident across Texas and the rest of the
nation. Special precautions nonetheless would be required for
shipments to a disposal site proposed for Hudspeth County.
</P>
<P>
   State law requires the Texas Department of Health to inspect all
waste before it is transported to the site. Shipments from Maine
and Vermont would be examined just inside the Texas line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legislators wanted to make sure, no matter how safe
transportation has been, that each shipment is inspected before
it's put on Texas highways,'' said Richard Ratliff, chief of the
Health Department's Bureau of Radiation Control.
</P>
<P>
   Spot inspections are now performed for shipments bound for a
disposal site in Barnwell, S.C. The requirement to inspect each
load for the Texas site would begin once the site went into
operation.
</P>
<P>
   The site, which borders Interstate 10, would average two truck
shipments a week, said Rick Jacobi, general manager of the Texas
Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Although comprehensive records were not kept before the early
1970s, state and federal regulators say no one has been injured or
killed by radiation as a result of transportation accidents
involving low-level waste during the past quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is just not a big deal,'' said Joe Gilliland, a spokesman
for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the good safety record is that low-level waste
must be packaged in steel boxes and other protective containers.
Radiation levels 6 1/2 feet from the vehicle must not exceed 10
millirems per hour, and the vehicle's driver must not be exposed to
more than 2 millirems per hour, or 16 millirems for an eight-hour
workday. By comparison, most people receive about 360 millirems a
year, primarily from cosmic rays and other natural sources. A
millirem is a unit for measuring the biological effect of
radiation.
</P>
<P>
   A worst-case accident _ such as a collision causing a fire that
released radioactive materials into the atmosphere _ would cause
exposures of 2 millirems to people who evacuate promptly and as
much as 200 millirems per minute to people who do not leave the
area, according to an analysis commissioned by the waste authority.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have not detected any health problems from exposures
at these levels. However, prevailing scientific opinion holds that
any exposure to radiation, no matter how small, poses some
increased risk of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups and other critics said the authority's
analysis understated the risk because it underestimated population
densities and omitted some waste from the calculations.
</P>
<P>
   But two state administrative law judges concluded that ``truly
extreme'' accident scenarios ``would not pose an exceptional risk
to the public even if they were to occur.'' They said the
transportation record is ``excellent.''

SUNBEAM RESTATES RESULTS, AND `FIX' SHOWS SIGNIFICANT WARTS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move that repudiates the purported turnaround of the
Sunbeam Corp., the troubled maker of home appliances said Tuesday
that it had restated financial results from six quarters to adjust
for inflated profits and greater losses than previously reported.
</P>
<P>
   The restatement, which amends the results from the fourth
quarter of 1996 through the first quarter of this year, contradicts
claims by Albert J. Dunlap, the company's former chairman and chief
executive, that he had fixed the company and delivered its best
year ever in 1997. The company now says that some of the revenue
gains and profits for that year reflected errors in accounting
rather than a big recovery for the maker of Oster blenders and
Sunbeam electric blankets.
</P>
<P>
   Sunbeam said that restated revenues from the first quarter of
this year are $248 million, not the $244 million originally
reported. The restatement also reflects a substantially larger net
loss for the period of $54 million, or 63 cents a share instead of
$45 million, or 52 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   For 1997, Sunbeam said sales were actually $1.073 billion
instead of $1.168 billion and that net income for the year was
nearly three times lower than what was originally reported: $38
million, or 44 cents a share, instead of $109 million, or $1.25 a
share. What is more, had it not been for a $59 million gain in
certain one-time benefits, the company would have reported a loss
from continuing operations of $6.4 million instead of earnings from
continuing operations of $52 million. Also, revenue generated from
so-called bill and hold tactics and guaranteed consignment sales
resulted in sales being booked in the wrong quarters.
</P>
<P>
   For 1996, the results were actually better than first reported.
The company is now reporting a net loss of $215 million, or $2.59 a
share, instead of the $235 million, or $2.83 a share, loss it
initially reported. The loss was originally reported after Dunlap
arrived in July 1996 but well before he implemented his turnaround
plan.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, he said the company was ``a disaster'' and needed
his talents. Sunbeam dismissed him last June after his drastic
cost-cutting failed to strengthen the company's stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Dunlap characterized the restatement as ``technical
accounting issues'' and said he had relied on the company's outside
auditors. ``The items at issue in Sunbeam's restatement are items
that were fully disclosed to and examined by Sunbeam's outside
auditors, Arthur Andersen, before they certified Sunbeam's 1996 and
1997 financial statements, and the conclusions certified by Arthur
Andersen were fully reviewed by Sunbeam's audit committee prior the
their release,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunbeam audit was conducted by the company's audit committee
of its board of directors, Arthur Andersen and Deloitte &AMP; Touche,
which was hired as a consultant to assist.
</P>
<P>
   Sunbeam's stock closed at $7.6875 Tuesday, up $1.1875,
indicating that investors considered the announcement as removing
``a piece of uncertainty,'' said Scott Graham an analyst with CIBC
Oppenheimer. Investors also seemed to give a vote of confidence to
current management, which said it was focusing on returning the
company to profitability.
</P>
<P>
   But with such dismal results overall for the restated periods,
massive debt of $1.4 billion and inflated inventory levels,
analysts said Sunbeam's future still seemed bleak.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just trying to see how long they can hold it up,''
said Nicholas P. Heymann of Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   That is not the way management portrayed the company's outlook.
``With the restatement behind us, we will now be able to fully
focus our efforts on growing the business and restoring
profitability,'' said Jerry W. Levin, Sunbeam's president and chief
executive officer. But he also said that the company's financial
performance for the rest of the year would be poor.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the restatement, analysts said that by not offering a
look at its balance sheet, Sunbeam's management failed to provide
key information that could have given a clearer picture of the
company's potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you consider the debt load and the fact that the company
has no operating momentum whatsoever and the time it will take to
work off inventory, I don't think the company did much in terms of
showing us how it is going to manage for the long term,'' Graham
said.

 &HT;    Land commissioner race generates heat
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Forget the promises to keep beaches clean and
earn more oil and gas royalties from Texas' public lands to improve
schools. More than anything, it seems, the race to succeed Garry
Mauro as Texas land commissioner is a race about houses.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, houses.
</P>
<P>
   David Dewhurst, the Republican, has accused state Rep. Richard
Raymond, the Democrat, of living in the wrong one _ a house near
Bastrop, far from the legislative district Raymond is supposed to
represent. And Raymond has criticized Dewhurst for not paying
enough taxes on a house he owns _ a stately mansion, actually _ in
Houston's posh River Oaks neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   At times in recent weeks, it has seemed that, as much as
anything, Dewhurst and Raymond are battling against obscurity in a
race for an obscure job. For without the bickering reminiscent of
the old-time name-calling contests that years ago were an election
year staple in Texas, both campaigns concede that voters would
probably have paid far less attention to who will be the state's
27th land commissioner, a job created 161 years ago, when Texas was
still a republic.
</P>
<P>
   A Libertarian candidate, J. Manuel Montez, is also on the
ballot. Montez, 47, a Dallas teacher, did not return phone calls
for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the rhetoric, the campaign styles and backgrounds of
Raymond and Dewhurst provide the biggest contrast in the race _ and
an insight, perhaps, into how each would fill the $92,200-a-year
job they both want.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond, 37, is a product of small-town South Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Born and raised in Benavides, population 1,500, in the
politically notorious Duval County, Raymond was the son of a
longtime county employee and a schoolteacher. As a young man, he
recalls watching the corrupt political machine at work and vowing
to change things if he ever got a chance.
</P>
<P>
   At age 19, he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a poll watcher. People stuffed the ballot box, Box 3. We
challenged the election and won,'' Raymond explained. ``I was told
at one point, though, that if we didn't drop the challenge that
they would fire my mother. We didn't, and they did. It took her two
years to get her job back.''
</P>
<P>
   He said another challenge to the political machine also cost his
father his job. ``But I was always proud that my father was honest,
that he never stole anything,'' Raymond said.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond said his interest in politics blossomed while he
attended the University of Texas, where he earned a degree in
government. In 1984, he campaigned across Texas in Bob Krueger's
unsuccessful bid for U.S. Senate and then went to work for U.S.
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, as a special assistant.
</P>
<P>
   He later worked for U.S. Paul Simon, D-Ill., as an aide on
environmental and energy issues and then worked as an executive
assistant to Mauro _ the official he is now seeking to replace.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, he was elected to the Texas House, where his
assignments have included the prestigious budget-writing
Appropriations Committee and energy and economic development
panels. He was a sponsor of the Texas Tomorrow Fund, which allows
parents to arrange for their children's future college education at
today's tuition prices.
</P>
<P>
   Dewhurst, 53, was born and raised in a working-class section of
Houston. His father was killed by a drunken driver when Dewhurst
was 3, and he recalls many tough years in which his mother scrimped
and saved to get by. After graduating from Houston's Lamar High
School in 1963, he attended the University of Arizona, where he
played basketball and earned a business degree before enlisting in
the Air Force for a stateside tour of duty.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Central Intelligence Agency as a case officer
assigned to Bolivia in 1971, at a time when the leftist president
was ousted in a right-wing military coup. Dewhurst _ who is
prohibited by law from divulging details of his work _ laughs off
suggestions by some publications that he was involved in
cloak-and-dagger activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a junior case officer . . . Generally speaking, I helped
American tourists in trouble, handled visas, things like that,'' he
said in a recent interview. ``To suggest I did anything else I
guess is a backhanded compliment. But it's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   He insists he has had no ongoing contacts with the CIA, although
he was appointed by then-Sen. Bob Dole to a congressional
commission on intelligence issues in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   After two years with the CIA, a bored Dewhurst _ ``I felt like
everything was happening in Washington, in the United States, and I
guess I felt like I was missing the action'' _ quit to become a
Houston-based energy consultant in South America.
</P>
<P>
   He soon started an oil service company. That eventually grew
into his current position as chairman of Falcon Seaboard Holdings,
but not before the oil bust of the mid-1980s nailed him. One of his
companies sought bankruptcy protection. Disgruntled business
partners sued him, alleging fraud and embezzlement. His finances
were a mess of red ink.
</P>
<P>
   While Raymond insists those troubles 10 years ago ``raise
serious questions about how David Dewhurst got his wealth,''
Dewhurst said there is no mystery about what happened. Ignoring the
advice of advisers who urged him to file for personal bankruptcy
and walk away, Dewhurst vowed to repay those he owed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me to avoid the grief, the poverty of paying people
back. But I was just too proud. I couldn't do that,'' he said. ``I
lived extremely frugally for three or four years, practically on
nothing. It was important to me that I keep my good name intact.
That took another five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Dewhurst notes that several of the formerly disgruntled
business partners who sued him have been repaid for their
investments. Several now support his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Dewhurst's business ventures _ including
ventures to convert natural gas to electricity, a project in which
one plant alone was sold in 1995 for $226 million _ have paid off
handsomely. He sits on 22 corporate boards and those of the Houston
Grand Opera and Greater Houston Partnership.
</P>
<P>
   He reported his taxable income last year as $3.7 million. So why
does he want a job that pays only a pittance, in comparison?
</P>
<P>
   ``I became interested in politics several years ago,'' Dewhurst
said, explaining his donations to Republican Party heavyweights in
recent years, even a four-year stint as Texas GOP finance chairman.
``After everything good that has happened to me, I feel a need to
give back. I want to try to make a difference in a positive way.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the River Oaks mansion that Raymond has tried to
make into a campaign issue, Dewhurst and his wife, Tammy Jo, a
former model, own two other homes in Houston, ranches in Colorado
and near Kerrville, at least one Austin house and a condo in Santa
Fe, N.M. They live in a rented Houston home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may own more houses that I don't live in than anyone else,''
Dewhurst laughs. ``I invest in real estate. What else can I say?''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Raymond says he makes less than $80,000 a year _
about $70,000 from oil and gas royalties, $7,200 as a legislator.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates' political war chests are as mismatched, as well.
So far, Dewhurst has raised more than $4.6 million in donations, $4
million of that from loans he personally guaranteed and $160,000
from his own pocket. Raymond has raised about $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   What that means is that Dewhurst can run lots of television
commercials, a key to getting noticed in the final weeks before the
election. Raymond can run few. To try to get his name known, he has
resorted to a barrage of press releases attacking Dewhurst _ but so
far, they have drawn only limited press attention.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid conflict-of-interest questions concerning their
financial ties to the oil and gas industry, which the General Land
Office deals with, Dewhurst months ago placed his financial
holdings in a blind trust and Raymond has said he will donate his
oil royalties to school charities if he is elected.
</P>
<P>
   Though their careers are different, their campaign platforms are
similar. Both promise to boost earnings from Texas' 22 million
acres of public lands, which the General Land Office oversees. Both
promise to protect Mauro's legacy of protecting beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Both vow to expand benefits to Texas veterans. The Land Office
oversees several veterans' programs. Both endorse expanding a
program that takes natural gas from state lands and, instead of
collecting traditional cash royalties, sells it at a discount to
utilities who then pass along the savings to schools and state
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   And, even though the Land Office has little to do with Texas
school policy, both have made education a priority. Raymond says
Dewhurst favors a state-paid voucher program that ``would take $1
billion from our public schools and give it to elite private
schools and the home-schoolers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to focus on saving our schools,'' Raymond says. ``He
wants to ruin public education. I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Dewhurst denies that. He said he favors a pilot voucher program,
like the one backed by Gov. George Bush. Dewhurst said it was a way
to give parents an option and prod public schools to improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I favor public education. I am a product of public education.
I want to give our children a chance,'' Dewhurst said. ``I don't
want to turn public education upside down. . . . But my opponent
wants to maintain the status quo, and that's not fair to our
children when they are trapped in failing schools.''
</P>
<P>
   While education may be the public's interest, the race for land
commissioner is important to the political parties for another
reason: The winner will sit on the panel that will draw new
legislative and congressional district boundaries, and both parties
want to make sure they have the majority membership.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, both parties are watching the land
commissioner's race closely.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Dewhurst has appeared the confident winner.
Raymond has portrayed himself as ``the underdog who will win.''
</P>
<P>
   And should they not be elected?
</P>
<P>
   Dewhurst said he will return to the world of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like public policy,'' Raymond says. ``I'll probably become a
policy wonk.''

TEXAS FLOODING SHIFTS DOWNSTREAM; FLOODWATERS COVER A QUARTER OF
STATE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By THADDEUS HERRICK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the death toll climbing to at least 22, the high water
ravaging the state shifted downstream Tuesday, inundating South
Texas and all but assuring this disaster a place among the worst of
Lone Star floods.
</P>
<P>
   So far floodwaters have covered nearly a quarter of the state,
according to the Texas Division of Emergency Management.
</P>
<P>
   Several people are reported missing and thousands are homeless.
Swollen rivers swept along houses, cars and livestock.
</P>
<P>
   While insured losses related to the storms are expected to
exceed $90 million, total losses are almost sure to be in the
hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush requested disaster relief for 20 Texas
counties, a third of the staggering 60 counties that have seen
flooding since soaking rains began over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``God works in mysterious ways,'' said Bush, who toured a New
Braunfels neighborhood northeast of San Antonio Tuesday in addition
to viewing flood damage from a helicopter. ``Only three months ago
we were praying for rain because we were too dry. And now here we
stand at the site of the devastating flood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We get these sorts of floods periodically,'' said Bill Reed,
chief meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Houston,
recalling the rains in the fall of 1994. ``But this has got to be
approaching something monumental.''
</P>
<P>
   In South Central Texas, where some areas received as much as 20
inches of rain, residents of San Antonio and points north began to
clean up. In San Antonio, officials re-opened Interstate 281, the
downtown freeway.
</P>
<P>
   But in towns like Victoria, which sits on the Guadalupe River
about 125 miles south of Houston, helicopters plucked residents
from the roofs of houses as the coffee-colored river was expected
to crest early this morning at as much as 15 feet above flood
stage.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in boats made similar rescues, often of residents
who had refused to leave their homes. The flooding knocked out
power downtown, left a small part of the city of 60,000 under water
Tuesday night and prompted locals to call the high water the worst
in more than 60 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Army National Guard estimated the swollen Guadalupe, usually
about 150 feet across, to span some four miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the worst flooding I've ever seen,'' said Mike Ratcliff,
Victoria County sheriff. ``Some parts of town are under 10 feet of
water.''
</P>
<P>
   In Cuero, 27 miles northwest of Victoria, three-quarters of the
town of 7,000 was under water after the Guadalupe crested at 49.78
feet, more than double its 20-foot flood stage.
</P>
<P>
   City Secretary Nancy Gips said at least 2,000 people abandoned
their homes to spend the night in shelters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just taking it a minute at a time,'' she said. ``Until
the water recedes, we can't do much of anything except make sure
everyone's safe and dry.''
</P>
<P>
   Showers lingered in parts of South Texas but did little to
aggravate the situation. Forecasters predicted clear skies across
the state by Thursday night, possibly bringing to a close an
unlikely and highly charged weather system that has combined heavy
moisture from two hurricanes off Mexico's west coast, a slow-moving
cold front and a steady stream of moist air from the Gulf of
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flooding is not uncommon,'' said Jon Zeitler, a forecaster
with the National Weather Service. ``What's uncommon is the amount
of rain that fell.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the Colorado River also was wreaking havoc on
South Texas communities downstream, such as the town of Wharton.
</P>
<P>
   While 7,000 people have been evacuated from their homes
statewide since Saturday, some 1,500 are being temporarily housed
in shelters.
</P>
<P>
   The floods are the third since August to strike Texas, with a
total of at least 31 dead. Nine died in the Del Rio floods, which
occurred when the remnants of Tropical Storm Charley stalled over
West Texas, and Tropical Storm Frances inundated Houston and
Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities continued to find flood victims Tuesday. In Caldwell
County in Central Texas, they recovered the body of 11-year-old
Heather Cottle in a Suburban 27 feet under water. Seven-year-old
Devon McCoy, with the young girl when the car washed off a road,
was still missing.
</P>
<P>
   In San Antonio, where life was just getting back to normal after
three harrowing days, police discovered the body of a 37-year-old
man, while the body of a 6-year-old boy was found in Comal County.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio businesses, many of them suffering from water
damage, spent the early part of the week cleaning up mud and
debris. So too did homeowners, some whose homes were filled with
several feet of water. Home improvement stores were reporting brisk
sales of water vacuums.
</P>
<P>
   Up Interstate 35, in New Braunfels and east to Seguin, the
devastation of homes was even greater along the Guadalupe.
</P>
<P>
   The governor termed the damage he saw on the aerial tour
devastating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to imagine how swift and powerful the current must
be,'' Bush said. ``I can't imagine how ferocious nature must have
been to do the damage I saw.'' &QL;

<P>
   WYE MILLS, Md. _ With King Hussein of Jordan joining President
Clinton at the Middle East peace talks, optimism rose on Tuesday
that some kind of settlement will be reached between Israelis and
Palestinians after more than 19 months of stalemate and 6 days of
talking here.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans and the Palestinians are pushing for a
comprehensive interim accord, so that a final round of peace talks
can start now. But the Israelis have at different points suggested
the possibility of a partial accord, with later talks on some
disputed issues.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials said the parties were working on a comprehensive
accord that would involve trade-offs on the key sticking points.
Having identified the disputed issues for both parties, the
Americans are working on a single package of mutual concessions
that could produce a comprehensive interim settlement.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said the talks, originally scheduled to end
on Sunday night, would go late into the night again on Tuesday and
then into Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met on Tuesday with Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian
leader, and then with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel,
and the three were expected to have dinner together. Hussein met
with Arafat and Netanyahu separately on Tuesday, in meetings of
about 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   One sticking point is the Israeli demand for putting on trial on
charges of attacks against Israelis a specific list of
Palestinians, including some members of the Palestinian police and
self-defense forces.
</P>
<P>
   Another is the method by which Israel will guarantee safe
passage for Palestinians between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
The Israelis are offering regularly scheduled trains and busses,
while the Palestinians are insisting that individuals be allowed to
travel in cars.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis also say they must have a firm commitment from
Arafat that the full Palestine National Council will meet at some
point to amend publicly the Palestinian charter, formally removing
clauses that call for Israel's destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials complain that apparent Palestinian commitments
on specific security moves, like the confiscation of excess weapons
and the reduction of Palestinian forces to levels laid out in the
Oslo accords, suddenly seemed to disappear during the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that they have their territorial requirements met, the
Palestinian interest has been to erode Israel's security
positions,'' Dore Gold, Israel's chief delegate to the United
Nations, said on Tuesday night. ``But Prime Minister Netanyahu
remains firm in not letting that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the Palestinians want clear assurances that a
third Israeli withdrawal from West Bank land, as required under the
Oslo agreement, will take place and be of a certain percentage. The
issue will be handled by the border commission of the so-called
final-status talks, but the Palestinians want American guarantees
of the outcome, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton left the talks just after midnight on Tuesday morning
after making ``significant progress,'' officials said, on key
aspects of the security package that Israel demands from the
Palestinians in return for 13 percent more of West Bank land.
</P>
<P>
   He returned here just after noon on Tuesday for another long
round of meetings, continuing his investment of 45 hours over six
days.
</P>
<P>
   Final-status talks under the Oslo umbrella are to produce a
peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians that will
settle the hardest remaining issues: whether the Palestinians will
have a state, what its borders will be, the rights of refugees and
the status of Jerusalem. After interim steps, the final talks were
supposed to have concluded by next May 4.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said the president would fly
to Los Angeles on Saturday, on a fund-raising trip for Democratic
candidates that he had postponed to continue these negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The willingness of Hussein to come, despite his serious illness,
adds moral pressure on both sides to make the political sacrifices
required for peace. The king, 62 and battling non-Hodgkins
lymphoma, arrived at midday and is expected to remain overnight at
the Wye Conference Center near here.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days Hussein has been in touch with all parties by
telephone. The Americans intend to ask him to work with both
parties when serious obstacles appear. Clinton has also spoken to
Egypt's president, Hosni Mubarak, to bring him up to date.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The State Department spokesman, James Rubin, said on Tuesday
night: ``This is the certainly the most intensive phase yet. But
there are significant gaps of substance and the linkages between
them. An inch is as good as a mile in terms of closing.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior American official said the work between the two sides
had turned serious in the last 12 to 15 hours, especially after
Clinton and his team had a two-hour meeting with Netanyahu and
Arafat before dinner Monday night, and then afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've seen this before, and I've seen this phase not lead
to an agreement,'' the official said. ``It's better than before,
but by no means enough to close.''
</P>
<P>
   Another American official said the Palestinian grenade attack on
an Israeli bus stop in Beersheba early Monday, wounding more than
60 people, ``acted as a sort of shock therapy to get them moving.''
But the official noted a degree of luck, saying, ``If 10 or 12
Israelis had been killed in the attack, the Israelis would have had
to pack up and leave these talks.''
</P>
<P>
   The talks here have followed a familiar pattern, another
official said. ``In the beginning, both sides came in with their
demands and won't move and repeat them and repeat them and repeat
them until everyone's sick of it, and then they begin to discuss
bridging ideas,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein, who flew to his Maryland home on Monday after being
discharged from the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, was asked by the
Americans to come here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the king will help bring home to the two delegations
the necessity of making the tough choices that lead to peace,''
Rubin said. The king has proved indispensable to peacemaking in the
past, making a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 and helping the
Americans to get the Israelis and Palestinians to agree to the
Hebron accords of January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the king traveled to Netanyahu's office in Tel Aviv to
work out the last details of that agreement, by which Israeli
troops pulled out of most of Hebron and set a schedule, since
abandoned, for other troop withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   But his support for the invasion of Kuwait by President Saddam
Hussein of Iraq nearly caused the United States to break relations
with Jordan seven years ago. King Hussein's army has fought both
the Palestinians and the Israelis, beating back a Palestinian
revolt in 1970 and taking part in Middle East war in 1973.

STRIKE GIVES NORTHWEST A LOSS; SOUTHWEST AIR PROFIT UP 40 PERCENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LAWRENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wounded badly by last month's pilots strike, Northwest Airlines
reported a $224 million third-quarter loss yesterday. Also
yesterday, Southwest Airlines, following the pattern of other
booming carriers, announced record earnings for the period.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest, the nation's fourth-largest airline, said that it
lost $2.91 a diluted share, compared with a profit of $290 million,
or $2.53 a share, in the corresponding quarter last year. Revenue
declined 31 percent, to $1.93 billion, from $2.8 billion in period
a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest also said that negotiations with the antitrust
division of the Justice Department over its plan to buy a
controlling stake in Continental Airlines would be resolved in
``days rather than weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas M. Steenland, Northwest's chief counsel, said he
expected the government to file suit to block the deal and a
proposed alliance between the two carriers if no agreement was
reached soon, and he predicted that Northwest would win in court.
``Because we believe this transaction is pro-competitive, we would
anticipate that we would prevail,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The airline said its operations were recovering quickly from the
strike, with traffic around normal levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been some talk that the market might be softening,
but we don't see that in our own bookings at the moment,'' said
Michael E. Levine, an executive vice president in charge of
marketing and international operations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Northwest continues to suffer more than most United
States carriers because of the strike and its substantial exposure
in Asia, which accounts for nearly one-third of its revenue. The
airline put the total cost of the walkout, which grounded
operations for 18 days, at $630 million. It said it expected to
post another loss in the fourth quarter and for the full year.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Northwest fell $2.375 Tuesday, to $24.8125.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest, the largest discount airline, said its net income
surged 40 percent in the quarter, to $129.6 million, or 37 cents a
diluted share, compared with $92.5 million, or 27 cents a share a
year earlier. Revenue increased 10 percent, to $1.1 billion, from
$997 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Kelly, Southwest's chief financial officer, said the key
factors in the quarter were strong passenger demand and low fuel
prices. Southwest's planes left the ground with an average of 70
percent of their seats filled, one of the highest levels ever. Fuel
costs dropped nearly 19 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly added that Southwest _ which is sought out each year by
officials of hundreds of cities hoping to attract its low-cost
flights _ planned to expand capacity 13 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Average seat growth for the industry is forecast at 5.5 percent,
according to analysts. Kelly said Southwest would like to grow even
faster if it could add more Boeing 737 jets to its fleet at
attractive prices.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Southwest Airlines fell 62.5 cents Tuesday to $20.25.

BANKAMERICA PRESIDENT RESIGNS, EFFECTIVE END OF MONTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Coulter, the president of the newly merged BankAmerica
Corp., resigned Tuesday, days after the company stunned investors
when it announced huge losses because of a loan to a hedge fund.
</P>
<P>
   The bank announced disappointing third-quarter earnings last
week in large part because of a $372 million write-down to cover
the loss on a loan to the hedge fund D.E. Shaw &AMP; Co. in 1997. That
write-down followed earlier announcements by the pre-merged
BankAmerica, saying it had pretax trading losses of $330 million,
largely because of bad trades in emerging markets and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is one element of David taking the fall for the D.E.
Shaw incident,'' said Ron Mandle, a banking analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein. Coulter, who was chairman and chief executive of the old
BankAmerica before it merged with Nationsbank last month, oversaw
risk management. His last day will be Oct. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter did not return phone calls but said in a statement
released by the company, ``The decision was extremely difficult for
me, both personally and professionally.'' Hugh L. McColl Jr., the
chairman and chief executive of BankAmerica, was at a policy
committee meeting Tuesday and did not return phone calls. But he
said in the same statement: `It is very painful to me personally to
accept his resignation. We wish him well.''
</P>
<P>
   But analysts and people close to the company say there may be
less regret than McColl's comments suggest. There has been
speculation for months about how long Coulter would stay at the
merged company, especially given that he could stand to gain more
than $30 million in cash and stock when he leaves, according to
regulatory filings.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter gave no reason for his resignation, but these people say
Coulter began to question whether he could work with McColl soon
after the merger was announced in April.
</P>
<P>
   The rift between the two grew increasingly more apparent this
summer when several jobs that were expected to go to BankAmerica
executives went to Nationsbank employees instead, these people
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave was feeling more and more that the promises upon which
the deal was agreed to were not materializing,'' one person close
to BankAmerica said. In one instance, this person said, when a
senior executive at the old BankAmerica asked to meet his new boss
from Nationsbank before being reassigned, he was told no and then
chided for not being a team player. ``There were lots of things
like that _ culture clashes and such,'' the person said.
</P>
<P>
   When the merger was announced in April, Coulter was expected to
take _ but was not guaranteed _ the top job when McColl retired.
But McColl, who is known for his military ardor and is famous for
keeping a hand grenade on his desk, had a different philosophy
about how to manage the combined company and was growing increasing
uncomfortable with anointing Coulter as the heir apparent, several
people close to the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The two had not talked to each other for several days. After
news of last week's losses, McColl sent W.W. Johnson, head of the
executive committee, to meet with Coulter for breakfast on Friday
to ask him to resign, the people said. A spokesman for the bank
would not comment on the relationship between Coulter and McColl.
</P>
<P>
   A successor to Coulter has not been announced. But he has been
replaced on the policy committee by Bill Vandiver, who headed up
risk management at Nationsbank and will report directly to McColl.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known whether more resignations among top managers are
on the way. Whatever the outcome, Judah Kraushaar, a banking
analyst with Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., said: ``Investors want to get a
better fix on what the composition of senior management will look
like at the company. The new BankAmerica has to reassure investors
that they are up to the task of managing businesses, like
international and capital markets.''

SAILER SUFFERS PAINFAUL CATCH-22
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA kicker/punter Chris Sailer is caught between
a rock and a sore place: namely, his right groin.
</P>
<P>
   Sailer needs to kick during the week to maintain his gameday
timing. But if he kicks during the week, he'll aggravate the
strained groin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to be practicing, but the best thing is rest,'' he
said. ``The injury won't heal unless I rest. If I kicked during the
week, I'd be out a month.''
</P>
<P>
   Sailer suffered the injury three weeks ago, before the
Washington State game, and it has tightened steadily. He's missed
three of six field goals in that span: two were blocked, and he
shanked a 21-yarder in the final seconds of regulation against
Oregon, which, he insists, had nothing to do with his groin.
</P>
<P>
   Groin, shank, bad biorhythms, whatever _ it hasn't been the
season Sailer expected. A second-team All-American in 1997, he's
made just 3 of 8 field goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't do what I normally do. That's frustrating,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior from Burbank, Sailer felt the initial twinge Sept. 30,
during a post-practice kicking display for a local TV station. It
had nothing to do with distance or quantity of kicks; he simply
wasn't loose.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, Sailer felt tightness while warming up for
Washington State. It was tighter the following week, at Arizona,
tighter still against Oregon. Now, he walks with a limp and gets 3
to 4 hours of treatment per day.
</P>
<P>
   The pain is greatest early in the week, then relents until
Saturday. The more rest he gets, the better it feels. The more rest
he gets, the less timing he has.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best of what we've got,'' coach Bob Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   If Sailer has to relinquish one of his duties, it'll be
kickoffs. Walk-on Chris Griffith will travel to Cal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to play,'' Sailer said. ``Even if I'm only 50 percent,
I'll kick. There's no question in my mind. I won't miss a game.
There's no other option.''
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Stat of the Week:!off! The Bruins have scored at least 40
points in five consecutive games, a school record.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!He's here. He's there. He's...:!off! Senior outside
linebacker Brendan Ayanbadejo, a Santa Cruz native, was named
captain for an unprecedented second consecutive week.
</P>
<P>
   ``As well as he's played, being a senior, being from the Bay
Area, there were too many pluses,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from safety Larry Atkins, Ayanbadejo is the Bruins' best
defensive player, fourth in total tackles (22) but first in
tackles-for-loss (six), sacks (five) and fumble recoveries (three).
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Medical report:!off! It began with quarterback Cade
McNown and receiver Brian Poli-Dixon, then spread faster than a
UCLA scoring drive.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, 10 players missed practice because of the stomach flu.
Most had recovered Tuesday, but the Bruins were bracing for another
attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes so fast,'' Toledo said. ``The ones that had it are
making progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Poli-Dixon, no longer flu-stricken, has turf toe and won't
practice this week. He's probable for the Cal game.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Welcome back:!off! Defensive end Kenyon Coleman had two
fumble recoveries against Oregon after missing 2{ games with a knee
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of his better performances since he's been here,''
Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman will start at one end against Cal, Pete Holland at the
other.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!By the numbers:!off! The Bruins are 5-0 for the first
time since 1988, when they started 7-0 and climbed to No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA has won six consecutive games against ranked opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have scored on 83.8 percent of their red zone chances
(inside the opponent's 20-yard line). They have 23 touchdowns and
three field goals in 31 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA leads the Pac-10 in turnover margin (plus-2.0).
</P>
<P>
   Kickoff for the Stanford game Oct. 31 at the Rose Bowl is 3:30
p.m.

`GHOST TOWN': TALL (AND EXISTENTIAL) IN THE SADDLE
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Near the end of ``Ghost Town,'' Robert Coover's exuberant,
word-rich parody of an American western, a photographer shows up to
take pictures of a man about to be hanged. What ensues is a
wonderfully brief and witty takeoff on art criticism, gallows humor
of a literal sort:
</P>
<P>
   ``It was his studied opinion, the man said, spreading out his
samples and compelling attention, that a photograph of one hanged
man has a more melancholical aspect about it than do those of
groups, though men strung up in multitudes of a dozen or more not
only provide peculiar challenges and opportunities for the
enterprising photographist, being less of a stereotype, as might be
said, but they also have a way of opening up the foreground of
pictorial scrutiny and drawing attention to those who have not yet
been hanged.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the features of Coover's new novel are contained in
that passage. There is the utterly deadpan appreciation of the
grotesque, for example, and the comically vernacular elegance of
the writing as well as Coover's almost lubricious sense of the
mythic. ``Ghost Town'' is a funny, ribald and, as the photographer
might have put it, melancholical story, set in the sere and surreal
landscape of a place called the Territory. The Territory is a place
where Zane Gray or Louis L'Amour might have set their stories, and
Coover's book is an affectionate and mostly delicious parody of
what they would have written.
</P>
<P>
   I say mostly delicious because it is extremely difficult to
sustain a parody through more than a few pages. Once the reader
gets the joke, the rest has a tendency to become a variation on the
theme, and can get tiresome quickly. Coover's parody does flag here
and there, becoming repetitive. His ever-shifting landscape, a
cross between Brett Hart and Salvador Dali, shifts once or twice
too often. But that is a minor problem. When Coover reaches a high
point, as he does with his ``photographist,'' the point is high
indeed, and these points come frequently enough to rescue the book
from its moments of languor.
</P>
<P>
   We begin with a lone cowboy riding toward an empty horizon, and
within one or two pages, two elements of the book have already
become apparent. One is Coover's striking gift for language, his
ability to create a narrative tone in perfect harmony with the
universe of his story. ``No resistance,'' our narrator says when
the cowboy comes across a well and tries to crank its rusty handle.
``Like wagging a dead man's bones.'' This is a book of constant
stylistic inventiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The second element is the mock mythic quality of a story in
which the author mimics an archetype but then both lampoons and
exceeds it. ``Beer is drawn,'' begins a description of a saloon in
Coover's ghost town. ``An ear is torn off. A bony bald man in a
white shirt, yellow suspenders, and black string tie bangs out a
melody on the grand piano, against which a buxom rouged-up lady
with wild orange curls leans, singing a song about a good girl who
went bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Here and there, as we follow Coover's cowboy on his antic and
fierce adventures, we reach a metaphysical moment as the cowboy
reflects philosophically, striking a blunt, roughneck,
profanity-laced existentialism that seems actually to improve on
Sartre.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a drifter,'' Coover has his narrator tell us, ``and one
whose history escapes him even as he experiences it, and yet to
drift is to adventure and to overstudy one's history is to be ruled
by it, and he is above all a free man, intent on pursuing his own
meaning even if there is none.''
</P>
<P>
   Coover's cowboy, never given a name, dwells in a treacherous,
unfeeling universe, a place where there is not only overwhelming
danger and despair but where mirage and reality blend and
interchange constantly and duplicitously. He sees things that are
suddenly behind him or that continue to recede toward the horizon
as he approaches them. When he finally enters the town where the
action of ``Ghost Town'' takes place, it is empty, as ghost towns
are, but soon it is filled with a motley crowd representative of
all of the western archetypes.
</P>
<P>
   There are the gamblers with scars, half-breeds, lynch mobs, the
gunmen who plug holes in their rivals' hearts as casually as they
would toss back a shot of red-eye. There is the over-endowed saloon
singer who falls for the cowboy, and the schoolmarm who dresses in
strict black and corrects everybody's grammar. There are Indians
and settlers, rattlesnakes and mustangs and the desert surrounding
the town like a hostile ocean around an island. Coover's
characters, including the cowboy, speak in a dialect of the
author's invention that has the feel of authenticity to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'da hung yu straight off,'' the cowboy is told at one point,
``yu -dodrabbid no-good thievin varmint, but on accounta yu wuz
wunst a lawman, yu'll git a trial, fair'n square, and then we'll
hang yu.''
</P>
<P>
   The story itself, insofar as there is a story, consists of an
ever more farcical series of adventures, in which the cowboy, who
becomes sheriff, desperately escapes the amorous intentions of the
saloon singer. Several times he is about to be hanged or otherwise
maltreated, and each time Coover invents some new way for him to be
rescued. In the end, a sort of final confrontation takes place in
which the cowboy voyages through the town, whose features and
inhabitants are seen as if in fun-house mirrors, in an act of
redemptive but unrewarded virtue.
</P>
<P>
   No good deed goes unpunished, the saying goes, and the cowboy is
punished by a kind of eternal return, back to the condition he was
in when we first met him, making his lonely way through a world so
unsteady that we are never sure what exactly is dream and what has
actually happened. It is a testimony to the power of Coover's
writing that when we take leave of our hero, we are left with
deeper feelings, about loneliness and the futility of the quest for
meaning, that go well beyond what the usual satire would provide.

HOME-BUILDING GIANT KAUFMAN &AMP; BROAD ADDING ON WITH LEWIS BUY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- In a deal that makes it the nation's biggest home
builder, Kaufman &AMP; Broad Home Corp. said it is buying Upland-based
Lewis Homes for about $544 million.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies are about 40 years old, and while they operate in
some of the same markets, namely Southern California and Las Vegas,
there won't be much product overlap because Lewis builds pricier
homes, executives said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Lewis Homes just opened Oak Terrace at Stevenson
Ranch in the suburban Santa Clarita Valley, a development of 125
homes priced in the low to mid-$300,000 price range.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman &AMP; Broad, based in suburban Westwood, has about 600 units
planned or under construction in neighboring Ventura County and the
suburban San Fernando, Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys, with
some homes priced in the $180,000 range.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Karatz, Kaufman &AMP; Broad's chairman and chief executive
officer, said the acquisition will strengthen his company's lock on
the home-building market in the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lewis Homes is an excellent strategic fit with our
operations,'' Karatz said. ``They have a similar operating
strategy, and their leading market shares in California and Nevada
combined with Kaufman &AMP; Broad's strong presence in those areas will
be a major boost to our market dominance strategies.''
</P>
<P>
   The sale is expected to close in January and be ``strongly
accretive'' to Kaufman &AMP; Broad's per-share earnings on an annual
basis in 1999, Karatz said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, the nation's largest privately held home builder, is
expected to generate 1998 revenue of $685 million on the sale of
3,500 homes. The company also owns about 24,000 lots and has a
backlog of some 1,200 homes.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman &AMP; Broad's 1998 revenues are estimated at $2.4 billion on
about 15,000 deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company is expected to deliver about 21,000 new
homes next year, vaulting it past Pulte Corp. of Philadelphia as
the country's top builder in terms of units.
</P>
<P>
   Randall Lewis, executive vice president of Lewis Homes, said the
company decided to sell now because it could negotiate a deal from
a position of strength due to the vibrant housing market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kaufman &AMP; Broad was a highly attractive merger partner from
the beginning, due to the similarities of the two operations,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Terms call for the Lewis Homes ownership group to receive $409
million in cash and Kaufman &AMP; Broad stock. The company will also
assume about $135 million in Lewis debt and the Lewis family will
get one seat on the Kaufman &AMP; Broad board.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has about 600 employees, and Kaufman &AMP; Broad about 2,300.
Minimal layoffs are expected.

to haul in enough food and fuel to make it to the next thaw, or
they shiver and starve through the coming months of darkness. It is
easy to call Russia's travails political or fiscal crises. But here
in the Siberian republic of Yakutiya, where a bad debt can condemn
thousands to months of hunger, they can be a matter of survival. By

NOMINATION FOR FDA COMMISSIONER NEARS APPROVAL IN SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A powerful Republican senator dropped his
opposition Tuesday to President Clinton's choice to head the Food
and Drug Administration, clearing the way for the Senate to approve
the nomination before adjourning.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has become one of the most influential in the federal
government, responsible for assuring the safety of drugs, medical
devices, food and cosmetics for millions of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the president nominated Dr. Jane E. Henney, a cancer
specialist with experience in government and academia, as the
agency's next commissioner, replacing Dr. David Kessler, who left
18 months ago to become dean of the Yale University Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Henney's seemingly unblemished record, a handful of
conservatives, led by Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the Republican
whip, objected to her nomination. They expressed concern that
Henney might confound Congress by taking advocacy positions on
issues like abortion and tobacco, just as Kessler had.
</P>
<P>
   But Nickles announced on the Senate floor Tuesday that Henney
and her boss, Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala,
had addressed three specific concerns and that he was lifting his
opposition. A voice vote on Henney's nomination could come on
Wednesday, the last day the Senate is expected to be in session
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident that she'll be a very able administrator who
will not play politics, who doesn't have a political agenda, who
will try to administer the Food and Drug Administration as a
professional organization to make sure the drugs and medical
devices are safe and sound for America's population,'' Nickles
said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Henney's nomination appeared to be sailing
through the Senate. The Labor and Human Resources Committee
approved her by voice vote in September. But Nickles then blocked
Henney's nomination until he could question her.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration insisted for months that Nickles had
been ``misinformed'' about Henney's positions on several issues,
and tried to win over the Oklahoman, who is the No. 2 Republican in
the Senate, with a series of meetings and phone calls in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Henney cleared her first hurdle by reassuring Nickles, who has
had one of the most conservative records in the Senate, that if
confirmed she would not solicit an American manufacturer for
RU-486, the French abortion pill.
</P>
<P>
   Federal money may be used to pay for an abortion only if a
doctor certifies that without the procedure a pregnant woman's
health or life is endangered. Shalala promised not to include harm
to a women's mental health as reason to authorize a federally
financed abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Health and Human Services Department promised
Nickles that it would not deny approval for a state's children's
health insurance program because that plan did not cover abortion
for teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Henney has also promised to carry out changes that Congress
approved last year that are intended to modernize the food and drug
agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very encouraging step, but we're not taking anything
for granted,'' a spokeswoman for the department, Laurie Boeder,
said Tuesday night. ``Secretary Shalala is still working very hard
on the nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   Henney, a 51-year-old Indiana native, has been the vice
president for health sciences at the University of New Mexico since
1994. In that job she oversees the daily operations of one of the
state's largest health care centers, with an annual budget of $466
million.
</P>
<P>
   She was Kessler's deputy for operations from 1992 to 1994, but
played no role in the agency's rulings on tobacco in that period or
on RU-486, top department aides said Tuesday night.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Kessler became a lightning rod for Republican critics by
challenging the tobacco industry and asserting the agency's
authority to regulate cigarettes and smokeless tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the agency's authority over tobacco, however, was struck
down by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Richmond, Va.,
after the industry appealed the ruling. The government, in turn,
appealed that decision, so the breadth of the agency's authority
will ultimately be determined by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   In the spending bill that the House approved Tuesday, though,
lawmakers included $34 million to help the FDA enforce regulations
that require retailers to restrict tobacco sales to people 18 years
or older.

SAILER SUFFERS PAINFUL CATCH-22
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA kicker/punter Chris Sailer is caught between
a rock and a sore place: namely, his right groin.
</P>
<P>
   Sailer needs to kick during the week to maintain his game-day
timing. But if he kicks during the week, he'll aggravate the
strained groin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to be practicing, but the best thing is rest,'' he
said. ``The injury won't heal unless I rest. If I kicked during the
week, I'd be out a month.''
</P>
<P>
   Sailer suffered the injury three weeks ago, before the
Washington State game, and it has tightened steadily. He's missed
three of six field goals in that span: Two were blocked and he
shanked a 21-yarder in the final seconds of regulation against
Oregon, which, he insists, had nothing to do with his groin.
</P>
<P>
   Groin, shank, bad biorhythms, whatever _ it hasn't been the
season Sailer expected. A second-team All-American in 1997, he's
made just three of eight field-goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't do what I normally do. That's frustrating,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior from Burbank, Sailer felt the initial twinge Sept. 30,
during a postpractice kicking display for a local TV station. It
had nothing to do with distance or quantity of kicks; he simply
wasn't loose.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, Sailer felt tightness while warming up for
Washington State. It was tighter the following week, at Arizona,
tighter still against Oregon. Now, he walks with a limp and gets
three to four hours of treatment per day.
</P>
<P>
   The pain is greatest early in the week, then relents until
Saturday. The more rest he gets, the better it feels. The more rest
he gets, the less timing he has.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best of what we've got,'' coach Bob Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   If Sailer has to relinquish one of his duties, it'll be
kickoffs. Walk-on Chris Griffith will travel to Cal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to play,'' Sailer said. ``Even if I'm only 50 percent,
I'll kick. There's no question in my mind. I won't miss a game.
There's no other option.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Stat of the week: The Bruins have scored at least 40 points
in five consecutive games, a school record.
</P>
<P>
   __ He's here. He's there. He's...: Senior outside linebacker
Brendan Ayanbadejo, a Santa Cruz native, was named captain for an
unprecedented second consecutive week.
</P>
<P>
   ``As well as he's played, being a senior, being from the Bay
Area, there were too many plusses,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from safety Larry Atkins, Ayanbadejo is the Bruins' best
defensive player, fourth in total tackles (22) but first in
tackles-for-loss (six), sacks (five) and fumble recoveries (three).
</P>
<P>
   __ Medical report: It began with quarterback Cade McNown and
receiver Brian Poli-Dixon, then spread faster than a UCLA scoring
drive.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, 10 players missed practice because of the stomach flu.
Most had recovered Tuesday, but the Bruins were bracing for another
attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes so fast,'' Toledo said. ``The ones that had it are
making progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Poli-Dixon, no longer flu-stricken, has turf toe and won't
practice this week. He's probable for the Cal game.
</P>
<P>
   __ Welcome back: Defensive end Kenyon Coleman had two fumble
recoveries against Oregon after missing 2{ games with a knee
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of his better performances since he's been here,''
Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman will start at one end against Cal, Pete Holland at the
other.
</P>
<P>
   __ By the numbers: The Bruins are 5-0 for the first time since
1988, when they started 7-0 and climbed to No.1.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA has won six consecutive games against ranked opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have scored on 83.8 percent of their red-zone chances
(inside the opponent's 20-yard line). They have 23 touchdowns and
three field goals in 31 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA leads the Pac-10 in turnover margin (plus-2.0).
</P>
<P>
   Kickoff for the Stanford game Oct. 31 at the Rose Bowl is 3:30
p.m.

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
COLLEGE STATION _ Of the four teams Texas A&AMP;M has played in each of
the previous three football seasons, only one has managed to keep
the Aggies on the losing end of the scoreboard all three times.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A&AMP;M defeated Texas once, Colorado once and Baylor in all three
matchups, but Texas Tech is 3-0 against the Aggies since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tech definitely has been a thorn in our side,'' A&AMP;M tight end
Dan Campbell said. ``It eats you up. There are two teams I always
want to beat _ Texas is No. 1 and Tech No. 2. I want us to get that
thorn out of our side.''
</P>
<P>
   The most painful part for the Aggies is the fact that they could
have won all three games, losing two of the matchups by a field
goal and one by a touchdown at the end on an interception by former
Tech linebacker Zach Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have given us a lot of trouble, and that's the one team I
haven't beaten,'' A&AMP;M tailback Dante Hall said. ``And the way they
have beaten us is silly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we owe them, but the stakes of this game make it
bigger because you can have sole possession of first place. This
could decide who wins the South in the Big 12. Everybody has their
eyes on the prize now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies (6-1 overall, 3-0 Big 12), who are ranked No. 8 in
the nation, are the only team in the South Division without a loss.
Tech (6-1, 3-1) is ranked 25th after falling 19-17 last weekend at
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever wins this game definitely has a plus in the race,''
A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum said. ``Somebody is going to have to overtake
the team that wins this game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning it for us is big because it would give Tech its second
loss, and Texas (2-1) still has Nebraska to play up there. If we
lose this one, we're all in the same boat. That's how it is in this
league. You're always dodging hand grenades and hoping somebody
else hits one.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason A&AMP;M hasn't been able to avoid losses against Tech the
last three years is turnovers. The Aggies have suffered 10
turnovers _ three interceptions and seven fumbles _ in their last
three meetings with the Red Raiders while Tech had two turnovers in
1996 and none in '95 or '97.
</P>
<P>
   But Slocum points out some other factors that have led to A&AMP;M's
demise against Tech. Injuries forced the Aggies to start two
inexperienced tackles in the game last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we went to Lubbock without our two starting
offensive tackles and our starting tailback (Hall),'' Slocum said.
``That was a tough place to break in. Their defense is very good,
and we would have had a tough time with them anyway, but trying to
do it with new starters at both tackles was a real chore.''
</P>
<P>
   Slocum also emphasized that the losses have come under unusual
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like all three are games we should have won,'' he
said. ``They've been frustrating games for us. It has been kind of
strange.
</P>
<P>
   ``We threw an interception at the end of the game (in 1995) that
was the winning touchdown. Last year, they won it when their backup
kicker (Tony Rogers) made a 47-yard field goal when it hit the
upright and bounced over.''
</P>
<P>
   The defeat Slocum didn't bring up was the one at College Station
in 1996 when Tech fullback Sammy Morris turned a screen pass into
an 81-yard score for the winning touchdown. Two days later, Morris
was declared ineligible.
</P>
<P>
   But Slocum doesn't want to give the impression he thinks Tech
has been lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't take anything away from Tech,'' Slocum said. ``They
put themselves in position to win those games. They don't beat
themselves, because they are extremely well-coached.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spike (Dykes) has weathered a few storms there and now has one
of the most consistent programs in the conference. I always marvel
at how hard they play. You can never count them out against
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Slocum thinks there might be a more subtle reason why the Aggies
have struggled at times against the Red Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always play well against Baylor because a lot of players
from both schools are from Houston and Southeast Texas and they
know each other,'' Slocum said. ``But you go down the Tech roster,
and our guys don't know many of them because those guys are from
West Texas. Playing Tech is not nearly as familiar for our players
as it is to take on Texas or Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Southwest Conference, we had lot bigger rivalries with
Rice and Houston, from the kids' standpoint, than we did with Tech.
So I've always thought this was a bigger game for Tech than it was
for us. But the situation with the Big 12 South is changing that.
Our players realize this is a big game.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time A&AMP;M was ranked in the top 10, it was Tech that
knocked the Aggies out with a 14-7 victory at Lubbock in 1995. But
the A&AMP;M players believe things are different this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know how important this game is,'' Campbell said. ``We can
open a gap between us, Tech and Texas. We need to win this one as
much as any game we've played.''

SLOPPY BUT LOVABLE MOORES COULD HAVE PADRES ON THE MOVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ San Diego Padres president Larry Lucchino, looking
like the captain of one of those million-dollar Mission Bay yachts,
wore a white shirt and a snappy double-breasted blue blazer to a
news conference yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   His blow-dried coif was deftly combed back for the appearance,
which was an opportunity to extol the virtues of a new ballpark in
San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The dumpy guy next to him with the glasses wore brown slacks and
shoes and a plain beige shirt. A U.S.S. Peleiu baseball cap covered
his curly short black hair.
</P>
<P>
   You almost expected Lucchino to say, ``And now here's Joe Smith,
our assistant equipment manager, who will tell you why he will Vote
Yes on C.''
</P>
<P>
   Only this wasn't Joe Smith and he wasn't the equipment manager.
He's John Moores and he owns the equipment, the socks and jocks,
the rest of the franchise, and another billion or so dollars beyond
that.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that has been given to charity. The University of
Houston got $51 million. Emory University got $20 million, plus a
pledge for $50 million more. San Diego State got $10 million so
they could build Tony Gwynn Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   He also founded the River Blindness Foundation and regularly
lets former president Jimmy Carter fly around the world on charity
missions in his own private jet.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks Brothers apparently got nothing. A billion bucks and he
looks like Andy Griffith's next door neighbor, the one who does his
shopping at the local five-and-dime. This is a guy who was
complaining he couldn't wear his favorite blue jeans to Yankee
Stadium because they had champagne stains left over from the
National League playoff celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a pudgy computer geek,'' Moores pleaded.
</P>
<P>
   But if he'd get his nose out of a Sony Playstation and check out
the batting practice scene at Qualcomm Stadium yesterday, he'd see
how a billionaire is supposed to dress.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's Chip Caray wore a charcoal grey suit to accent his brown
pancake makeup. Joe Morgan strutted around in a burgundy sports
coat, while Jon Miller wore a blue blazer and turtleneck.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the annoying but impeccable ``Arliss'' guy,
Robert Wuhl. He not only stars on HBO as super-successful sports
agent Arliss Michaels, but he's also the show's executive producer,
which lands him those steamy love scenes with Katarina Witt.
</P>
<P>
   Wuhl strutted around the field yesterday like he, and not
Moores, owned the place _ meeting and greeting every player whose
attention he could get. A camera followed at close range to capture
those moments that make Arliss the award-winning show that it is.
</P>
<P>
   Arliss: ``How you doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Caminiti: ``I could be better.''
</P>
<P>
   Arliss: ``Yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti: ``We'll get it together.''
</P>
<P>
   Arliss: ``Have a good game.''
</P>
<P>
   Exit Caminiti nodding, stage right.
</P>
<P>
   But Wuhl was truly stylish in his black-striped suit. Moores, on
the other hand, is a fool. If he dressed like Wuhl, he'd have a new
stadium right now.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he'll have to settle for the admiration, respect and
shameless fawning of every player, coach, manager and citizen in
the Greater San Diego area, at least those planning to Vote Yes on
C.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, they've become smitten with the pudgy computer geek
from Houston who took a measly $1,000 investment and built a
billion-dollar software business, then bought the Padres in 1994
and brought them instant respectability.
</P>
<P>
   ``John is one of a kind,'' Lucchino said. ``I've been in sports
for 25 years and I've never seen an owner that has the personality
and competitive nature that he has. The Padres and San Diego are
extraordinarily fortunate to have John Moores.''
</P>
<P>
   But the actual depth of that love will be tested Nov. 3, when
the citizens of San Diego go to the polls and vote on a $411
million ballpark to be built on the waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   Moores is pledging to spend at least $115 million of his money
to help build the place and promises to cover any and all of the
inevitable cost overruns.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are a few irrational folks in San Diego who
steadfastly believe the geek with the champagne-stained pants
should take his billions and buy his own ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   But his wife, Becky, snapped back in ``USA Today'' by telling
those fools, ``Those people who think he's rich, he'll figure out a
way to stay here, are sorely mistaken. We've accomplished \Rthe
Padres success\S with a tremendous amount of debt. I'm not willing
to lose any more money, especially when we could be giving it to
starving children.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he's huggable and lovable, a generous geek who
doesn't know how to dress and hasn't heard of lemon juice for those
pesky champagne stains. But he found his way from Texas to San
Diego and he can find his way to Northern Virginia if that Nov. 3
vote doesn't pass.  &LR; tagtop:T.R. Sullivan, (817) 390-7760

ARNOLD M. AUERBACH, 86, A COMEDY WRITER  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SEVERO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Arnold M. Auerbach, a comedy writer who wrote for
Fred Allen, Milton Berle and Al Jolson and who contributed sketches
to the successful Broadway revues ``Call Me Mister'' and ``Inside
U.S.A.,'' died on Monday at New York Hospital. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach got his first taste of show business in 1932, when his
script, ``How Revolting,'' was selected for Columbia University's
varsity show, which was presented in the Grand Ballroom of the
Waldorf Astoria. His collaborator for this production was Herman
Wouk.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, as an Army private first class, he
contributed sketches to Frank Loesser's ``About Face,'' a musical
comedy staged by Special Services by, with and for soldiers. It
starred Jules Munshin and Vincente Gomez and also became Mickey
Rooney's vehicle for entertaining troops in Europe. He also wrote
sketches for other Army shows: ``Hi, Yank!'', which had music and
lyrics by Loesser and Alex North, and ``PFC Mary Brown,'' a Women's
Army Corps revue with Loesser songs.
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach's exuberance on returning to civilian life was
expressed in his work for the hit 1946 Broadway revue ``Call Me
Mister,'' with a score by Harold Rome and winning performances by
Betty Garrett and Munshin. Auerbach wrote the sketches with Arnold
Horwitt.
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach and Horwitt teamed with Moss Hart to write the sketches
for another successful Broadway revue, ``Inside U.S.A.'' in 1948.
The show starred Beatrice Lillie and Jack Haley and had songs by
Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach, Rome and Munshin were less successful when they put on
another Broadway revue, ``Bless You All,'' with Pearl Bailey in
1950. He wrote for Fred Allen's radio show and and Milton Berle's
``Texaco Star Theater'' and also created material for Nat Hiken,
who used it in the ``Sergeant Bilko'' television series, starring
Phil Silvers.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold Auerbach was born on May 23, 1912, on the west side of
Manhattan, the son of Dr. Julian Auerbach, a doctor, and the former
Olga Offner. He attended the Franklin School and Columbia, where he
also received a master's degree in journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years he contributed satirical essays to The New York
Times and other publications. His books include ``Funny Men Don't
Laugh'' (1965), an account of his days as a comedy writer for
radio, and ``Is that Your Best Offer?'' (1971), a novel.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Justine; a daughter, Nina Auerbach
of Philadelphia, and a son, Andrew, of New Haven, Conn.

PROTESTS SHOW IMPACT OF SHEPARD KILLING ON GAY COMMUNITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to include Tuesday night prayer service in 5th graf and to
change ``murder'' to ``killing'' in 6th graf.) (Eds: See also NY-GAY-RALLY) 
(mk) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For some of the younger marchers, the demonstration
Monday night that paralyzed parts of midtown Manhattan was their
first political rally. For some older protesters, though, the march
_ to express outrage over the killing of a gay college student in
Wyoming _ was a return to the angry street protests that had so
often symbolized the militancy of the gay rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   As the chaotic denouement of the march and the police response
was debated Tuesday, one thing seemed clear: The size of the
loosely organized protest showed how the killing of Matthew Shepard
has galvanized gay men and lesbians in New York and around the
country as has no other single event in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration began at 6 p.m. as a rally in front of the
Plaza Hotel on 59th Street near Central Park, then swelled to 5,000
people on Fifth Avenue, blocking traffic. Confrontations with
police officers resulted in 120 arrests.
</P>
<P>
   While the size of the protest in midtown surprised even its
organizers, the evocation of anger and sadness on the streets of
New York was not unique. Candlelight vigils have been held across
the country, from Washington to Grand Junction, Colo., Raleigh,
N.C., and Lubbock, Texas. In San Francisco, the giant rainbow flag
in the Castro district that symbolizes the gay rights movement was
lowered to half staff.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has been filled with discussion of the crime.
Tuesday night, 1,000 people attended an hourlong prayer service for
Shepard at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the passion, participants say, is a sense that even
as gay people have become more accepted than ever, there are
reminders of the hatred and violence of the not-so-distant past.
Well before Shepard's killing, an increase in police reports of
anti-gay crimes in New York City had unsettled gay people, shaking
them out of complacency in the years since the height of AIDS
activism.
</P>
<P>
   Recent protests over issues like benefits for domestic partners
and the right to march in the St. Patrick's Day Parade have lacked
the drama of the guerrilla street tactics of AIDS activists. Some
gay men and lesbians contend that their success in drawing
attention to AIDS gave some a false feeling of security and
acceptance, especially in the city with the largest gay population
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a sense, I think, in the gay community, particularly
living in a certain segment of it in New York City, that we can
live in a kind of bubble and feel relatively safe and feel as if
we've arrived,'' said Tim Allis, 37, a magazine editor. ``A sense
that gay rights are there, that we are so much a part of the
mainstream in so many ways, so visible, with so many role models on
television. It's a bit of an illusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Ruble, 45, had been to two gay pride rallies and parades,
but never to a large protest march until Monday night. ``Sometimes,
in our little gay lives in the middle of America, I think we have
forgotten that they kill us,'' he said. ``They hate us.''
</P>
<P>
   In more than 20 interviews with gay men and lesbians in the past
week, many people said that the killing of Matthew Shepard had
struck a strong emotional chord. Some cited his clean-cut image.
Others spoke of the brutality of the crime, in which he was left,
severely beaten, lashed to a fence in near-freezing temperatures to
die.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Blotcher, who was a spokesman for Queer Nation, a street
protest group, in the early 1990s, said that in recent years, his
group and other militant organizations had run out of steam and
were failing to attract young members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking to younger people to pick up the mantle and it
wasn't really happening,'' he said. ``I attributed that to that
fact that a new generation came of age and said: `I don't have to
be a gay activist, I'm just a gay person. It doesn't have to be an
issue.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think something like this reminds us that it still is an
issue,'' he added. ``There were lots of young people at the rally
on Fifth Avenue. And there were people I know there who had hung up
their activist mantles and gone into semiretirements.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, there were 82 anti-gay bias crimes reported
this year through Oct. 4, compared with 46 during the same period
last year, representing a 78 percent jump, said Deputy Inspector
Barbara Sicilia, commander of the Bias Unit. Overall bias crimes
rose by 2 percent, to 384 from 374.
</P>
<P>
   Although the most incidents were reported in lower Manhattan,
where they usually occur, more incidents were also reported in the
boroughs of Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Locke, director of client services at the Gay and Lesbian
Anti-Violence Project, a nonprofit organization that helps victims
of bias crimes, said the spread of bias crimes across the city
shows the extent to which gay people are becoming more visible
outside their usual neighborhoods, Greenwich Village and Chelsea in
Manhattan and Park Slope in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most gay-related crimes have people come to your neighborhood
and seek you out to hurt you,'' he said. ``Now people don't have to
come downtown. As we are more visible outside of Manhattan, we have
also seen an increase in crimes in those neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   While many activists believe that anti-gay crimes are on the
rise across the country, statistics are difficult to come by. The
National Coalition of Anti-Violence Projects, which collects data
from 14 organizations across the country, reported that violent
crimes against gay people rose 2 percent, to 2,445 incidents, in
1997, the last year for which statistics are available. In 1996,
the report said, anti-gay crimes rose by 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But those figures reflect incidents labeled bias crimes by local
organizations, which often use different standards from police when
determining motivation. Jack Levin, a professor of sociology and
criminology at Northeastern University in Boston and an author of
``Hate Crimes: The Rising Tide of Bigotry and Bloodshed'' (Plenum
Press, 1993), said it was not unusual for anti-gay crimes to buck
the trends of other bias crimes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Most hate crimes respond to economic factors like the
unemployment rate, but not gay-bashing,'' he said. ``Gay-bashing
has nothing to do with money, with economic survival. That's why so
many perpetrators are teen-agers and come from every point among
the economic continuum. It is typically done by young people, with
their hormones raging, feeling confusion about sexual identity.
Young guys in denial about their own homosexual feelings who see
the very presence of a gay person as a threat.''
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration Monday night was billed as a ``political
funeral'' for Shepard. But organizers also saw it as an opportunity
to protest the rise in anti-gay crimes in New York City and to call
on the state Senate to pass an anti-bias law for gay people.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen states, including New York, do not have legislation
that specifically prohibits anti-gay hate crimes. In these states,
someone who assaults a gay man or a lesbian can be convicted of
assault, but not a bias-related assault. New York does have a law,
aggravated harassment in the first degree, that outlaws harassing
people because of ``the race, color, religion or national origin of
such person,'' but it makes no reference to sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Allis, the magazine editor, said that Shepard's killing put
recent history into a new light.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was that sense of connecting the dots,'' he said.
``Between the well-publicized murders, the less-publicized hate
crimes that we hear about across the country, Trent Lott's words
calling homosexuality a disease, and small acts of intolerance,
there were all sorts of indications. But the murder of Matthew
Shepard brought the picture into relief.''

FRENZY OF DEALS IN ADS AND MARKETING SERVICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By COURTNEY KANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pace of transactions involving agencies specializing in
advertising, public relations and other marketing communications
services has accelerated again, this time with the announcement of
five acquisitions. Financial terms of the deals were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The frenzy reflects how the dynamics of traditional advertising
and marketing keep changing as independent shops are rapidly
snapped up by larger agencies.
</P>
<P>
   One deal involved the communications and marketing division of
the MDC Communications Corp. in Toronto, which further expanded its
presence in the United States by acquiring a majority interest in
Source Marketing, a strategic promotion agency in Westport, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Source, founded in 1989, has 24 employees and billings estimated
at $7 million from clients including the Campbell Soup Co., the
Eastman Kodak Co., Home Box Office and Reckitt &AMP; Colman. Howard
Steinberg, 40, president, will continue to head Source, owning a
minority stake in the agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been approached by a number of organizations looking to
acquire us over the years,'' Steinberg said. ``However, we agreed
to partner with MDC because of their philosophy of independence and
autonomy and their ability to bring additional resources to enhance
the growth prospects for our business going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The Source deal is the third this year in the United States for
MDC, which owns three agencies in Canada including a sales
promotion shop, Accumark Promotions in North York, Ontario. In
August, MDC acquired a majority interest in Margeotes/Fertitta &AMP;
Partners in New York and in May, the company bought 75 percent of
Cyber Sight, an Internet marketing agency in Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sales promotion is a $80 billion sector of marketing services
that is growing 11 percent per year,'' said Miles S. Nadel,
president and chief executive of MDC. ``The acquisition of Source
Marketing represents an important step for us to swiftly obtain a
significant presence in this market in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   MDC also said it had signed letters of intent to buy another
American advertising agency, a public relations agency and a
corporate design company, but did not identify them.
</P>
<P>
   The second deal involved the acquisition of a Canadian agency.
</P>
<P>
   Euro RSCG Worldwide in New York, part of Havas Advertising,
bought Sharpe/Blackmore in Toronto, which has been renamed
Sharpe/Blackmore Euro RSCG. The agency, which was founded in 1996,
has 25 employees and billings estimated at more than $20 million
from clients including Absolut vodka, Dell Computer, RJR Nabisco
and Xerox.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Sharpe, 44, chairman and chief executive, and Tom
Blackmore, 49, president, will head Sharpe/Blackmore Euro RSCG in
those posts.
</P>
<P>
   The third deal also involved a unit of Euro RSCG.
</P>
<P>
   Healthview Euro RSCG, a division of Euro RSCG Healthcare
Worldwide, acquired Nethod LLC, a strategic online communications
agency in New York. Nethod has 10 employees and projected revenue
of $3 million from clients like the American Cyanamid division of
American Home Products, the Perkin-Elmer Corp. and Rhone-Poulenc
Rorer. Gregg Trueman, 42, president of Nethod, will continue to
head the agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nethod will provide online program development and management
of online communications services to all of Healthview's
divisions,'' said Ron Pantello, chief executive of Healthview and
Lally McFarland &AMP; Pantello Euro RSCG.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth deal involved Doremus &AMP; Co. in New York, the
business-to-business agency owned by Omnicom Group, which acquired
Colligan Group, a corporate advertising and direct marketing agency
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Colligan has five employees and billings estimated at $8 million
to $10 million from clients like Dictaphone, First Union National
Bank and the National Geographic Society.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Colligan, 47, president, continues to head Colligan and
becomes an executive vice president of Doremus.
</P>
<P>

EDMOND LEVY, 69, DOCUMENTARIAN  
 (HLW)

DEUTSCHE BANK IS REPORTEDLY SEEKING U.S. ACQUISITION
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By PETER TRUELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank, eager to buy a concern that will enhance its
international investment banking business, has been scouting out
prospects, including Bankers Trust Corp., Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. and J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co., bankers and analysts said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ronaldo H. Schmitz, a member of the board of Frankfurt-based
Deutsche Bank, recently visited with executives from several New
York financial companies, including Bankers Trust, according to a
Deutsche Bank executive who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Schmitz, 59, who oversees Deutsche Bank's investment banking
strategy as well as its North American business, was traveling in
the United States recently for the annual meetings of the World
Bank and the International Monetary Fund in Washington, Macy W.
Egerton, a spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank confirmed Tuesday. She
refused to say what banks Schmitz had met with on his visit.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank and Bankers Trust declined to comment on reports
published Tuesday in The Financial Times of London that their banks
were in ``preliminary talks'' about a possible merger.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the time may be ripe for Deutsche Bank to begin such
discussions, whether with Bankers Trust or some other United States
concern, analysts said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The declines in the American stock markets in recent months have
ravaged the stock prices of several big banks and brokerage firms,
making them cheaper potential acquisitions. While shares of Bankers
Trust rose $4.1875 Tuesday, to $58.9375, on the report of a
possible deal, they are still well below $58.9375, their price of
about $100 two months ago. Deutsche Bank's stock, however, has
fallen less.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank has signaled in recent months that buying an
American investment bank is its preferred route onto Wall Street,
after an expensive strategy of building by hiring bankers and
traders proved unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deutsche has publicly stated they want to buy'' a bank, said
Evangelos Kavouriadis, European banking analyst at Sanford
Bernstein &AMP; Associates, ``and they have plenty of financial
reserves,'' more than 44 billion marks ($27.14 billion). ``So the
will and the money is there. The question is from the available
candidates, who is the best fit?''
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank is looking for American investment banking
expertise to counter growing international competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would appear that what Deutsche and the big European banks
are worried about,'' said Guy Moszkowski, an analyst at Salomon
Smith Barney, ``is that if they don't rapidly improve their capital
markets capabilities, firms like Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch and
Goldman, Sachs'' will reap the rewards as capital markets in Europe
shift to stocks and away from bank financing under economic and
monetary union.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some American banks may also be more eager now to draw closer to
a powerful outside partner like Deutsche Bank. Russia's default on
its debts, the gloomier international financial outlook and the
sudden contraction of liquidity in many markets has unnerved many
of those who manage big American financial companies that deal in
the more speculative markets.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust, for example, has been the subject of negative
rumors in recent weeks in part because of its big businesses in
several markets that have recently done poorly, notably junk bonds,
derivatives and growth companies. It also has had some rude shocks
lately, having to put up $300 million as its part in the rescue of
Long-Term Capital Management L.P., the hedge fund in Greenwich,
Conn., that nearly collapsed. In early September, Bankers Trust
said that it had trading losses totaling $350 million in its
business with Russia. This Thursday, Bankers Trust is expected to
report its results for the quarter ended Sept. 30, with analysts
generally expecting layoffs and losses.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts Tuesday were scathing about the wisdom of any
such merger by Deutsche Bank in the current uncertain and volatile
climate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is probably one of the worst investment banking decisions I
could imagine,'' said Mark Hoge, bank analyst at Credit Suisse
First Boston in London. ``It is the worst possible environment to
be buying an investment bank at this time, given the market
uncertainties, and that you don't know how many gremlins are hiding
inside.''

``LENNY BRUCE: SWEAR TO TELL THE TRUTH'': A LIFE DESTROYED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lenny Bruce's last laugh echoes throughout ``Lenny Bruce: Swear
to Tell the Truth,'' a cleverly titled documentary recalling his
life, work and punishing legal travails. In this intimate and
affectingly nostalgic portrait, the lacerating comic emerges as
someone whose talent and long shadow have unequivocally withstood
the test of time.
</P>
<P>
   The dirtiest jokester of the 1950s and '60s still sounds as
fearless here as ever, while his appalled enemies appear
small-minded and quaint. And Lenny Bruce's notoriously raw humor
takes on a rueful innocence beside the much more vulgar standards
of comedy today.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you look back on it now, Kafka could not have written it or
imagined it or created it,'' says Martin Garbus, who was Bruce's
lawyer in the 1964 New York obscenity trial that effectively ended
Bruce's career. This documentary, directed by Robert Weide,
compellingly illustrates that point of view. Visibly charting
Bruce's ebullient rise and terrible fall through the use of home
movies, old photos, vintage television clips and many interviews
with friends and relatives, the documentary recalls the sad
trajectory of the man who once said, ``It's chic to arrest me.''
And it shows Bruce's transformation from the hippest, most caustic
figure of his day to the broken man who pleaded with a judge: ``I
so desperately want your respect. Please don't lock up these
words.''
</P>
<P>
   Weide, who has specialized in producing or directing television
documentaries about comic performers (among them W.C. Fields and
Mort Sahl), has compiled this portrait in straightforward
talking-heads style, but enlivened it with frequent glimpses of
Bruce. Bruce's mother, Sally Marr, was interviewed at length while
at the beauty parlor and supplied Weide with running commentary
about the son she called ``a melancholy child.'' (She died last
year.) Ms. Marr, her daughter-in-law Honey and granddaughter Kitty,
all heard here, also provided the filmmaker with family snapshots
and film scenes that bring Bruce's jubilant side to life. Images of
his early days show a lean, sexy iconoclast with the world on a
string.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lenny Bruce: Swear to Tell the Truth,'' which opens Wednesday
at the Film Forum, offers a look at Bruce's developing comic style.
Very early, he's seen imitating Katharine Hepburn in an act so
clean-cut that it pleases the host of Arthur Godfrey's television
show. But not much later, Bruce was experimenting famously with
racial epithets on the theory that ``if you say it enough, it loses
its meaning.'' He briefly tried writing and acting in Z-level crime
films. Then he began to work in strip clubs and, as the film's
narrator, Robert De Niro, explains: ``In burlesque joints, clean
jokes could get you thrown off the stage. The cheesier the dive,
the freer Lenny became. And before long, Dirty Lenny was born.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Dirty Lenny's best-known bits are heard here,
illustrating their streak of devastating social criticism. (``How
to Relax Your Colored Friends at Parties'' is one.) The film
strongly maintains that it was this, more than the use of
profanities now heard freely at multiplexes, on records and on
television, that sealed Bruce's fate. It traces a snowball effect
after Bruce was first arrested and accused the legal authorities of
trying to extort a bribe from him in exchange for freedom.
Certainly the combined effects of antagonizing the police and the
Catholic church earned Bruce no good will from those who could
break him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would arrest him for obscenity, but it was mostly a cover
for arresting him for blasphemy,'' states one friend, Paul
Krassner. ``And he became almost a Dostoyevskian character in his
obsession with the law as a redeeming force,'' says another, Nat
Hentoff. Candid scenes of Bruce clowning with Hentoff also clearly
reveal Bruce's drug use, another factor in his destruction. Loaded
with amphetamines, he fools around frenziedly and plays the piano
with his feet.
</P>
<P>
   Poignant images of an increasingly bloated, ravaged Bruce in his
final years, before his death at 40 in 1966, show a man ruined
physically, emotionally and professionally for performing with no
more license, and so much more honesty and conviction, than most of
his successors do today.

A FRESH VISION OF THE FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It is a perfect October afternoon in the Bel-Air
section, where Steve Duchesne is enjoying a family outing at a
playground near the home he shares with his wife, Tracee,
2-year-old son Lake and daughter Dillon, 3.
</P>
<P>
   But two years ago, life for the Duchesnes was anything but
normal.
</P>
<P>
   The family's troubles began when Steve, a 33-year-old defenseman
and a key offseason free-agent signee for the Kings, was playing
for Ottawa. Tracee was feeling a growing dread about Lake, who
didn't seem as responsive as her first child.
</P>
<P>
   In time, they learned Lake had ocular albinism, a rare
congenital condition that causes the eyes to lack pigment even
though the skin and hair show normal coloration. Ocular albinism
can cause delayed mental development in young children and learning
difficulties when they attend school.
</P>
<P>
   But before the Duchesnes understood Lake's condition, before
they learned he was mildly afflicted, before they knew their boy's
prognosis was bright, there were wrenching moments of anxiety as
they feared for their son's future.
</P>
<P>
   Tracee says she felt a gnawing concern for Lake almost from his
birth, which came nearly three weeks early. She noticed Lake didn't
seem as alert as Dillon had at the same age. She was also concerned
about his vision. Lake's eyes would jerk back and forth, and there
were times he couldn't hold them still.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew instinctively, right away, that something was not quite
right,'' Tracee said. ``He was slow developing. At about two months
of age, it dawned on me. He wouldn't look at my eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, with Steve on the road with Ottawa, Tracee's fears
became so unbearable she decided to perform her own test. She
couldn't find a flashlight, so she shut off all the lights, lit a
candle and waved the flame in front of Lake's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   There was no reaction, not even a blink.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was blind,'' said Tracee, 37. ``It was the worst
night of our lives. I was in complete hysteria and shock. I
couldn't reach Steve. He wasn't back at the hotel. I started
calling doctors, anyone who would listen.''
</P>
<P>
   She finally reached Steve late that night, leaving him to cope
with the situation from afar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pretty much stayed awake all that night,'' said Duchesne,
who will be in uniform at 4:30 today when the Kings play at
Florida. ``I talked to my wife three or four times. She was crying.
I was trying to calm her down. But I was devastated.''
</P>
<P>
   Answers were not immediate, though some reassurance came
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's blind,'' a doctor in Ottawa told Tracee
after examining Lake, ``but I don't know what he's seeing.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctor told her to come back in a couple of weeks. But
Tracee COULDN'T wait. She had to know what they were facing, so she
found a specialist in St. Louis who told her about ocular albinism.
She learned the uncontrollable eye movements were caused by
nystagmus, which often accompanies ocular albinism.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very concerned and distraught because she did not know
whether or not he could see,'' said Dr. Larry Tychsen, the St.
Louis pediatric ophthalmologist who diagnosed Lake. ``But she was
very reassured after the visit. At the conclusion of the first
visit, we could assure her that he was seeing, that he had a very
mild case and that the nystagmus would diminish with time.''
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't easy. The Duchesnes would have to wait and hope
the doctor's prognosis was accurate. Steve, meanwhile, struggled
with the doubts of an uncertain future for their son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tracee was great,'' says Steve, of Sept-Iles, Quebec. ``She
said, `Everything is going to be all right. There are other things
than sports.' She was right.''
</P>
<P>
   In the two years since the diagnosis, Lake has improved
dramatically. He is more alert, and on a recent afternoon didn't
hesitate to climb on the jungle gym and run and play with Dillon,
who Tracee said is Lake's best therapist.
</P>
<P>
   The nystagmus has regressed considerably and should continue to
do so, though Dr. Tychsen said it will likely never disappear
completely, and future eye-muscle surgery might be beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   The angst-filled days of two years ago are distant for the
Duchesnes. Lake might not grow up to be a great athlete, but his
future is expected to include regular school and a full, normal
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's probably the best thing that's ever happened
personally to me,'' said Steve. ``It's made me focus more on family
and what's more important in life. There are other things than
being an athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to emphasize this revelation, Lake ambles over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I get a kiss?'' Steve asks.
</P>
<P>
   Lake obliges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, merci,'' the father says, sounding truly grateful.

ALAN DONNAHOE, 82, FORMER HEAD OF A RICHMOND MEDIA COMPANY  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alan S. Donnahoe, a former president and chief executive of
Media General, died Oct. 10 at his home in Richmond, Va. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was heart disease, said his wife, Elsie Pitts
Donnahoe.
</P>
<P>
   Donnahoe was the president and associate publisher of Richmond
Newspapers in 1969, when he helped organize the Media General
communications company, by combining Richmond Newspapers Inc. and
the Tribune Co. of Tampa, Fla. Both companies were controlled by
the Bryan family. Richmond Newspapers owned The Richmond
Times-Dispatch and The Richmond News Leader, which merged in 1992.
Tribune owned two Tampa newspapers and a television and radio
station.
</P>
<P>
   Donnahoe was named president and chief executive of Media
General Inc. when it was formed. During the next two decades, the
company bought several regional newspapers, a newsprint company and
television stations in the Southeast including Jacksonville, Fla.,
and Charleston, S.C. Media General also entered the cable industry
in 1983, with Fairfax Cable.
</P>
<P>
   Donnahoe became vice chairman of Media General in 1982. He
retired in 1984, but served as a consultant and remained vice
chairman through 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Donnahoe served in the Army Corps of Engineers during World War
II. He joined Richmond Newspapers in 1950, and, after serving in
the Pentagon during the Korean War, he returned to the company and
was named vice president for marketing in 1955. He became an
executive vice president in 1959 and president and associate
publisher in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Mrs. C.
Porter Vaughan III, of Richmond.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Edward Watson Hook Jr., a national authority on infectious
diseases like salmonella and influenza, died on Oct. 5 at a hotel
in Gettysburg, Pa., where he had gone for a meeting. He was 74 and
lived in Charlottesville, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a coronary thrombosis, according to the University
of Virginia, where Hook formally retired this year as Mulholland
Professor of Medicine at the Health Sciences Center. He was
chairman of department of internal medicine at Virginia for 21
years, until 1990.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure he established the humanities in medicine
program, offering classes to awaken medical students to the
personal, human aspects of medicine. He frequently contributed to
professional journals and trained hundreds of specialists in
internal medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Hook, who was born in Sumter, S.C., graduated from Wofford
College in 1946 and received his medical degree at Emory University
three years later. Before joining the faculty in Charlottesville in
1969 as a professor and department chairman, he was associated with
Cornell University Medical College and New York Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   He was a past president of national medical organizations,
including the American College of Physicians, was elected to the
Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences and
served on the American Board of Internal Medicine. He was a former
board chairman of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Clinical
Scholars Program.
</P>
<P>
   Hook is survived by his wife of 49 years, Jessie Thurecht Hook;
two sons, Dr. Edward W. III, of Birmingham, Ala., and Robert R., of
Crystal River, Fla.; two daughters, Susan Norton, of London, and
Jane Brosig, of Sausalito, Calif.; and four grandchildren.

MARKET PLACE: HOME BUILDERS SEE ADVANTAGES OF CONSOLIDATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Nev., Fla., Ariz., Texas)  (mk) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Is a consolidation coming in the home-building
business? That could be one message drawn from the announcement
Tuesday that Kaufman &AMP; Broad Home Corp. will buy privately owned
Lewis Homes, a leading builder in California and Nevada. The price
is $409 million in cash and stock, plus the assumption of $135
million in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Already the largest home builder in California and the West,
Kaufman &AMP; Broad said the transaction would make it the largest in
the country, based on its plans to deliver 21,000 homes in 1999.
The current leader, Pulte Corp., is now building about 15,000 homes
a year.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was not officially announced until after the close of
trading but Kaufman &AMP; Broad's stock surged $1.0625, or 4.7 percent,
to close at $23.625.
</P>
<P>
   For 1998, Kaufman expects revenues of $2.4 billion based on
delivery of 15,000 homes. Lewis, based in Upland, Calif., expects
to deliver 3,500 homes in 1998 and record revenues of about $685
million. It is the largest builder in fast-growing Las Vegas, and
is strong in Northern Nevada, Southern California and Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   With low interest rates and a strong economy, home builders have
been flourishing. But fears that a recession is coming have
dampened share prices until the most recent week, when they have
rallied somewhat. Kaufman &AMP; Broad has been expanding in the last
few years outside California into other Western states. But the
latest acquisition will strengthen share on its home territory,
where it is being challenged by Lennar Corp., a Miami-based builder
that is expanding aggressively in California through acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman &AMP; Broad and some other builders ``are trying to focus
less on how many markets they can enter and concentrate on building
bigger share in the markets they are in,'' said John Stanley, an
analyst at Warburg Dillon Read, which represented Kaufman &AMP; Broad
in the Lewis acquisition. Having a big market share gives a company
an edge in procuring land and subcontractors and provides economies
of scale in purchasing and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Karatz, the president of Kaufman &AMP; Broad, said that the
push for size and market share meant that more deals would be in
the offing, both for his company and for others in home building,
historically an industry run by small, locally focused
entrepreneurs. ``People have figured out that you can successfully
combine builders,'' Karatz said in an interview. ``It was the
unwritten rule that you couldn't because they were entrepreneurs
and everyone had their own way of doing things.''
</P>
<P>
   Randall Lewis said he and his three brothers, who run Lewis
Homes, decided to sell when they saw the benefits of size. ``The
bigger companies were getting benefits in terms of purchasing,
borrowing on Wall Street and buying land,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a consolidation might not offer much opportunity for
investors. So far, most acquisitions have been of small, privately
held companies. One exception was the purchase earlier this year of
Continental Homes Holding Corp. of Scottsdale, Ariz., by D.R.
Horton Inc. of Arlington, Texas, a transaction valued at $467
million on the day it was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Growth through acquisition is only part of Karatz's strategy. He
has launched a program called KB2000 that aims to make home
building more of a disciplined business. Instead of building houses
and hoping to sell them, as many builders do, Kaufman &AMP; Broad is
trying to build to order, much like Dell Computer does. It does not
offer completely customized homes, but does extensive consumer
surveys and has built big showrooms to allow buyers to pick out the
fixtures and designs they like.
</P>
<P>
   Karatz said that KB2000 is improving the company's sales and
margins. But he concedes it is hard to isolate the effects of
KB2000 on the company's results from the effects of the generally
strong market in California and the West.
</P>
<P>
   The real test of KB2000 is likely to be when there is a
downturn. That could also be when more mergers occur. ``A downturn
in the housing market will force a greater amount of
consolidation,'' said Steve Percoco, an analyst with Lark Research
in Rahway, N.J.

HOUSE OVERWHELMINGLY APPROVES NEW FEDERAL BUDGET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs lede graf for recasting) (sw) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the face of conservative rebellion, House
Republican leaders enlisted Democrats on Tuesday night to win
approval for a $500 billion catchall spending package, an unwieldy
40-pound document of nearly 4,000 pages that virtually no one had
time to read before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   With the entire House up for re-election in just two weeks and
most lawmakers anxious to get home to campaign, the House voted
333-95 to accept the colossal package, copies of which arrived on
the House floor for review by members less than four hours before
Tuesday night's vote. Republican leaders had to rely on Democrats
to help pass the bill. In the end, 170 Democrats joined 162
Republicans and one independent to support it, while 64 Republicans
and 31 Democrats voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest defection came from conservatives, who complained
that the bill raided this year's anticipated budget surplus,
provided no serious tax cut and expanded spending for social
programs. They blamed President Clinton and liberals, but they held
House Speaker Newt Gingrich accountable for what they said was his
selling out his revolutionary fervor of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the vote, Gingrich roared back, presenting himself
on the House floor as a statesman and a consensus-builder. He
denounced the conservative firebrands, his former allies for whom
he was once their spokesman, as ``perfectionists'' who did not
understand the art of compromise and who had become ``petty
dictators'' in their own little worlds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surely those of us who have grown up and matured in this
process understand after the last four years we have to work
together on big issues,'' he declared. ``If we don't work together
on big issues, nothing gets done.''
</P>
<P>
   He said of the final cost of the package: ``Yes our liberal
friends get a few things, and in a free society when you are
sharing power between the legislative and executive branch, that is
precisely the outcome you should expect to get.''
</P>
<P>
   The omnibus bill, which allocates money for hundreds of programs
large and small and incorporates numerous policy decisions that
Congress never debated, now goes to the Senate. Along with many
House members, several senators expressed outrage on Tuesday at the
final price tag and the 11th-hour wheeling and dealing among
congressional leaders and the White House that brought the spending
package to fruition. But the Senate is expected to it on Wednesday
anyway, bringing down the curtain on the 105th Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The package accounts for about one-third of the $1.7-trillion
budget. After a generation of deficits, it includes a surplus, but
many members were infuriated that it spends about $20 billion of
the anticipated $70 billion surplus for ``emergency'' tasks, from
immunizing the government's computers to the 2000 bug to helping
farmers trying to cope with the loss of Asian export markets.
</P>
<P>
   Anger at the Republican leaders for spending so much and for
turning the budget into a free-form bazaar dominated by
special-interest pleadings came from across the political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., who is chairman of the
Appropriations Committee, called the process ``ugly'' and said, ``I
hated it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the Capitol, Sen. Robert Byrd of West
Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee who
is famous for the huge amount of pork-barrel spending he directs to
his home state, complained: ``This is a creation without a mother
or father. It's more like a Frankenstein monster patched together
from old legislative body parts that don't quite fit.''
</P>
<P>
   But those grievances, once aired, seemed to melt in the face of
more money for most congressional districts and a widespread desire
to get the whole thing over with and with Gingrich's impassioned
plea for support.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And those Republicans who, like Livingston, reviled the process,
still defended it. He said that this Congress was finishing ahead
of the time finished by 10 of the last 15 sessions of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich went beyond his previous approach of trying to sell the
bill on the basis of its smaller parts, such as the banning of
needle-exchange programs in the District of Columbia. Instead, he
belittled the conservatives as obstructionists who were unrealistic
in their demands.
</P>
<P>
   In defending the provision in the final bill for more than $9
billion in money for defense projects, he invoked Ronald Reagan, a
near-sainted figure to conservatives. ``Ronald Reagan said that
protecting our young men and women in uniform was more important
than the deficit,'' Gingrich declared.
</P>
<P>
   The final vote showed that moderate Republicans and Democrats
were the ones most pleased with the bill, although a handful of
moderates, such as Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., opposed it as a
budget-buster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moderates have really come into their own, and this
package reflects it,'' said a beaming Rep. Sherwood Boehlert,
R-N.Y. ``We've ended up on the center ground,'' he said, citing
funding for education programs, home-heating fuel for low-income
Americans, summer jobs for disadvantaged students, full financing
for the International Monetary Fund and more money for Amtrak, a
priority for members from the Northeast, who tend to be more
moderate than those from other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., laughed at his colleagues who
complained about not being given a chance to read the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been massaging this bill for the last two weeks,''
said Goss, chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence, an
area of the budget that received a substantial increase. ``Where
two or three people have gathered together, this bill has been
crafted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the final compromise was forced by a sensible desire by
Republicans to avoid a government shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   But the vote revealed a severe split in the Republican Party
that may be hard to patch up. Conservatives were hinting of future
storms over this budget. ``There's going to be an accounting for
this process,'' said Rep. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma.

VAN RAAPHORST HAS MORE TESTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC quarterback Mike Van Raaphorst underwent a
second battery of tests Tuesday as doctors continued to search for
a reason he has suffered nausea attacks before or during three
games this season.
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst underwent blood tests Monday, which did not reveal
any problems, and had further tests performed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's wrong,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said.
``There was a battery of tests yesterday. We did another battery
today. We'll get the results tomorrow. Is he 100 percent? I don't
know. There was nothing from the blood test. He was worn down by
the end of practice (Tuesday).
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get to the bottom of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett emphasized Van Raaphorst will start against Oregon, with
Carson Palmer in relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Van Raaphorst is the starter until I say he's not,'' an
irritated Hackett said. ``Until something dramatic happens, we're
going to go with the same situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst is at a loss explaining his bouts with nausea but
again ruled out nerves as the cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't happened at the same time. That's why it's not
nerves,'' Van Raaphorst said. ``I was 9 of 15 (passing). I felt
great out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst acknowledged he has been bothered by reports he
might be bothered by nerves.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more frustrating than if I have a bad performance,''
Van Raaphorst said. ``It's not an attack, but people are all trying
to find out what's going wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Words to regret?: In an answer sure to stir emotions in
Westwood, Hackett said Tuesday he believed Oregon was the best team
in the conference, even after its 41-38 loss to UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't turn the ball over against UCLA, they win the game
handily,'' Hackett said. ``To me, this is the team to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he might be inciting UCLA with his comments, Hackett
responded:
</P>
<P>
   ``UCLA-USC is its own event. It's its own separate thing. I
don't know if anything can be put on the bulletin board to affect
that rivalry. We're going to play UCLA in the distant future, so I
can't worry about that. I just sat in a hotel room and watched
where one team kept turning the ball over and lost in overtime. I
don't mean that UCLA's not very, very good. That's my opinion at
this point, and it may not be true when we face UCLA.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Cusano doubtful: Hackett said linebacker Mark Cusano (sore
left thigh) is doubtful this week. Cusano tested his leg during
pregame warmups at Washington State and was unable to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels better, but I haven't tested it yet (this week),''
said Cusano, who did not practice Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett also said he didn't think right tackle Matt Welch
(mononucleosis) would play this week.
</P>
<P>
   __ Two down, one to go: Assistant head coach Larry Petroff has
one more kidney stone that needs to be removed, after having
surgery to remove two last week. He will probably wait until the
next month's bye week to have the procedure done.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
INSTEAD of fast-breaking back to the bargaining table after the
in-your-face rejection by arbitrator John Feerick, NBA players have
headed to the Las Vegas gaming tables.
</P>
<P>
   My guess is fear and loathing will take on a whole new meaning
in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Some NBA players will feel the urge to double down every chance
they get. Press the hard eight. Split the aces.
</P>
<P>
   Baby needs a new pair of Bruno Magli shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them _ the NBA-minimum guys, the free agents and
borderliners _ will skip the trip or, egad, fly coach. They will
search for comped rooms and listen to Players Association leaders
and agents talk about strategies and plans.
</P>
<P>
   But what they should do _ and my guess is many players will _ is
wonder why at this most critical moment in the NBA lockout, the
Players Association acts as if this is some two-bit game of keno.
It acts as if it is playing with the house money, which, the rank
and file will remind leadership, it is not.
</P>
<P>
   This is the biggest gamble yet by the Players Association.
</P>
<P>
   In a league where the average salary is $2.6 million and the
last player on the bench makes at least $272,000, a prominent agent
was asked Tuesday how many players might nevertheless live paycheck
to paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than you think,'' he said. ``When you have more money in
your checkbook, you write bigger checks.''
</P>
<P>
   This is real. Real money is leaving players' pockets in the wake
of Feerick's decision. The owners have their sleeves rolled and the
pit-boss rake in their hands, and they are poised to scoop away
even more.
</P>
<P>
   When Feerick ruled Monday that owners do not have to pay up to
$800 million worth of guaranteed contracts during the NBA lockout,
it was a decision that should have given players no choice but to
concede the game and listen harder to the owners' proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, 226 players lost in the decision, which came after
$100 million in salaries had been lost when owners canceled the
first two weeks of the regular season. More delays will only cramp
the players' style and put the season in danger.
</P>
<P>
   But apparently there were no calls made to commissioner David
Stern's office after Monday's ruling. There was little public
acknowledgment by the union that the only recourse is for players
to look harder at the owners' latest offer and think about
gathering in a room, locking the door and splitting this $2
billion-a-year enterprise equitably.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the union decided to keep its scheduled meeting in Las
Vegas, roll the dice and play it cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you thought the guys were zealous about staying committed
to the cause before,'' Players Association director Billy Hunter
said, ``they're probably more rabid than they were before.''
</P>
<P>
   My guess is, no, that's not true. And the players will say so
this week.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the $800 million in guaranteed contracts
certainly will be honored when a new collective-bargaining
agreement is settled. But the $100 million in salaries is gone
forever.
</P>
<P>
   Another cancellation of games, which could be announced as early
as next week, will pull away millions more. Meanwhile, owners will
receive $25 million in television revenue even if no games are
played this season, thanks to smart TV-contract negotiating a few
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This lockout is beginning to hurt where it hurts the most.
Players will ask legitimate questions in Las Vegas and wonder why
they are sitting around gaming tables when the real jackpot is at
the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   A few cracks in the players' once-firm stance are showing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to wonder: Are you thankful for what you have, or are
you going to continue to play it out,'' Golden State's Muggsy
Bogues said. ``Sometimes, you need to look at the bigger picture
and be thankful for what you have.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the Las Vegas meeting is to discuss the players'
bargaining strategy. But almost every player knows the best
bargaining strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Start bargaining. Soon. Like, yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, only three formal negotiating sessions have been
conducted since the lockout began July 1. With the players in
Vegas, the earliest another meeting could be held is Friday, but
nothing has been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the foot-dragging occurred because both sides were
waiting on Feerick's decision. When that decision came Monday, the
players should have realized who had the cards and sprinted to the
bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they played it cool. They acted as if nothing could
break their resolve and headed for the last place that people
worried about finances should go.
</P>
<P>
   We know Hunter made this decision. But was it Billy Hunter, or
Hunter S. Thompson?

VICE PRESIDENT, IN MIDWEST, RISES TO NO. 1 CAMPAIGNER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 3rd graf to correct number of Gore's campaign appearances)  (af)  
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa _ This is crunch time in the 1998 campaign
season, and no Democrat is likely to be hammering Republicans
around the country more extensively than Vice President Al Gore in
the two weeks remaining before the Nov. 3 elections.
</P>
<P>
   With Democrats sensing improved chances and President Clinton
cutting back his travel to accommodate developments like the
Middle-East negotiations in Wye Mills, Md., Gore has become the
administration's busiest spokesman on the campaign trail, defending
Clinton's policies, criticizing the opposition and raising money.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy continued Tuesday in Illinois and Iowa, where the
vice president made nine campaign appearances in five cities before
flying on to New Mexico and California for more speeches over the
next two days. Between now and the elections, aides say he could
visit as many as a dozen states _ more, if Clinton stays home.
</P>
<P>
   In large measure, Gore is focusing on tightly contested House
races, or at least those in which a Democrat would have a better
chance of winning if the turnout were high. And if a Democratic
candidate for governor needs help, as Tom Vilsack does in Iowa, so
much the better.
</P>
<P>
   Vilsack, a state lawmaker who is challenging Jim Lightfoot, a
Republican, to succeed Gov. Terry Branstad, a Republican who is
retiring, accompanied Gore at each of his six stops Tuesday in
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're going to break any new ground on the
issues,'' an aide to Gore said. ``The focus now is turnout. We have
to bring up the level of enthusiasm, raise the level for
grass-roots intensity. We've made our arguments; we just have to
reinforce them.''
</P>
<P>
   Traveling around Iowa has an added benefit for Gore because, as
the probable Democratic front-runner to succeed Clinton, he can
expand his base in the state that holds the first presidential
caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   It has only been in recent weeks that Democrats have found
evidence through recent polls that the midterm elections might
produce something less than a disaster for them.
</P>
<P>
   Early predictions that the impeachment inquiry against Clinton
would cause Democrats to lose scores of seats in the House have
largely given way to more optimistic expectations, perhaps a loss
of fewer than 34, the historical average for the party in the White
House in the sixth year of an administration.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason, Gore said at a rally in Davenport for Bob
Rush, the Democrat challenging Rep. Jim Leach, an 11-term
Republican incumbent, is that Democrats perceive voters as angry
that Congress spent too much time on the Clinton sex scandal at the
expense of important legislation.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a new thought as part of Gore's standard stump speech,
which stresses education, health care and preserving Social
Security. But his expanding emphasis on Republican scandal-lust is.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Gore has been refining the core of his criticism

proceedings an Election Day referendum, a change from several
months ago when Democrats feared the scandal would bury them in the
fall.

 &HT;    Improvements on pass rush key among Texas's goals
 &HT;    By Mark Wangrin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Quarterbacks grab headlines, but Mack Brown is
more concerned with who can grab quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the main question facing the Longhorns coach this week
is whether to start Major Applewhite or Richard Walton at
quarterback against Baylor on Saturday, Brown said he's got more
pressing things on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are a lot of issues that are more important than
that this week,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Topping the areas in which Brown feels his Longhorns must make
great improvement over the last half of the season, when they'll
face two top-10 teams as they try to position themselves for a bowl
bid, is rushing the passer.
</P>
<P>
   Through six games the Horns have 10 sacks _ on pace to better
last season's total of 16 but still short of where they'd like to
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest improvement defensively has to be in the pass
rush,'' Brown said. ``Everybody says it comes down to the defensive
backs, but if you leave NFL guys out there too long, they'll give
up plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas won't see a dominant passing attack the rest of the way _
none of the five remaining opponents average at least 200 yards a
game or are ranked higher than 61st in the nation in pass offense _
but they will face opportunistic passing games. Baylor, which
visits Royal-Memorial Stadium on Saturday, has two dangerous
receivers _ seniors Morris Anderson and Derrius Thompson, who could
provide a good challenge for Horns cornerbacks Joe Walker and Tony
Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're tall, physical and can run real good routes,'' Walker
said. ``As long as we play good technique we'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   It'll help if they can get a rush. The Bears have allowed 18
sacks this year and have yielded nine interceptions, third most in
the Big 12, but Brown thinks the Horns will still have to blitz to
get good pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we're going to have to bring extra guys to get
there,'' Brown said. ``We're still not, as a group, getting to the
passer with four (rushers). What has improved, though, is the
mentality that if we bring more, that we have to get there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against Oklahoma and Iowa State, we blitzed more aggressively
(because) we knew we could get to the quarterback, rather than just
because Carl (Reese, defensive coordinator) called it.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said there are other areas that will play key roles in
whether the Horns close the season strongly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two big stories of the last five weeks are: Can we keep
forcing turnovers? And, can we improve in the kicking game?'' Brown
said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is plus-5 in turnover differential, a tremendous
difference over the Horns' minus-20 of a year ago. Last year the
Horns forced only 14 turnovers, a number they're on pace to almost
double this season.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said it's time for the freshmen on kick and punt coverage
teams to begin playing more consistently. Safety Lee Jackson missed
a tackle early on a 79-yard kickoff return by Oklahoma but ran down
returner Michael Thornton and pushed him out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave them 'til midseason to be freshmen,'' Brown said.
``They have to be experienced. Rookie year dies at midseason.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodges Mitchell is the only Horn to return a punt this season,
but he has only 10 returns on 35 opponent punts this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done good things but we're not scoring,'' Brown said.
``People are kicking away from Hodges, so we've even tried to block
a few punts.''
</P>
<P>
   Kicker Kris Stockton has been solid kicking off with the wind,
hitting the end zone on all but one of such kicks, but he must
improve on pooch kicks into the wind, Brown said.
</P>

 &HT;    Vail fire heightens
 &HT;    By Chris Barker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   VAIL, Colo. _ Racing shifty October weather, an army of 50
federal and state investigators wielding high-tech computer
software today will descend on the charred remains of seven
``suspicious'' fires that burned $12 million worth of property atop
Colorado's largest ski area.
</P>
<P>
   And while local fire and law enforcement authorities for the
second day refused to speculate on the cause of the fires, local
sentiment revealed sharply divided visions of the future of the
popular recreation area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't mind if they just keep burning it down, actually,''
said Bruce McLaughlin, a 59-year old Minturn resident and business
owner.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin, a resident of the area since 1980, referred to the
possibility that the fires were set by arsonists opposed to a
controversial 885-acre expansion of Vail's back bowls. Tree
clearing and fence construction on the expansion began Friday after
a judge denied an appeal filed by environmentalists to stop
construction due to disruption of possible habitat for the Canadian
lynx. That work resumed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Andree, spokeswoman for the Eagle County Sheriff's
Department, said Tuesday that the early Monday morning blazes that
burned above 11,000 feet were ``suspicious.'' She refused to say
whether a criminal investigation was underway, but she said a force
of FBI, U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Colorado
Bureau of Investigation officials were headed for Vail to
investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Romer called the fires an ``act of terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that mountain quite well, and it's inconceivable some
natural occurrence would cause simultaneous fires on that ridge,''
Romer said at a news conference in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Seven separate fires first detected about 4 a.m. Monday
destroyed a 33,000-square foot restaurant and the Vail Ski Patrol
Headquarters building and damaged several lifts. All of the damage
was related to facilities that would serve the controversial
planned expansion, which Vail officials said was still on schedule
to open to skiers in the 2000-2001 ski season.
</P>
<P>
   A media tour of the fire locations Tuesday revealed
still-smoldering ruins of two buildings and heavy damage to a lift
serving a popular back bowl. All of the damage - blackened eyesores
in the midst of a pristine 360-degree view from the Gore Range to
the Holy Cross Wilderness - overlooked the proposed expansion,
which Vail Resorts Spokesman Paul Witt said will eventually include
three lifts and a 20,000-square-foot restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters were hampered by poor access to the remote fires
and a lack of water.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously there's not much left up there and it's mainly due
to response times,'' said John Gulick, assistant fire chief of the
Vail Fire Department. ``We just couldn't really save much.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators plan to take advantage of what looks to be a
respite from the typical late fall pattern of storms on the
mountain to try to determine an official cause for the blaze. FBI
officials will use a computer program that compiles data gathered
in the investigation while CBI investigators will re-interview
possible eye-witnesses to the blaze, Andree said.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents of Minturn, a community of about 1,200 nestled in
a narrow valley southeast of Vail, suspected arson as the cause of
the fires immediately.
</P>
<P>
   But locals sipping coffee at the Cougar Ridge Cafe offered
contrasting views on whether or not such an act of sabotage would
be warranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad but it's to be expected I guess,'' said Ted Rohr, 79.
``I guess people really resent Vail Associates. They just walk over
the people and with the money they've got you can't fight them.''
</P>
<P>
   Minturn just last month settled a bitter 18-month legal battle
with Vail Associates over water rights.
</P>
<P>
   A group of local residents on Tuesday said their kids can't
afford to live in a town where a small modular home lists in the
local paper for $528,000. They fear traffic and land value impacts
from the expansion will drive their sons and daughters away.
</P>
<P>
   But other residents said the detriments of Vail's ascension to
the top ranks of international ski resorts must be balanced by the
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Wood, a 49-year-old contractor who has worked for Vail
Associates in the past, said he's against the expansion. But that
isn't all he's against.
</P>
<P>
   'I'm totally against whatever happened,'' said Wood, referring
to the possibility the fires were deliberately set. ``I don't think
that's the best way to go about things.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods said he was holding out hope that the fires were caused by
an individual and not a larger group aimed at ski area development.
But he admitted that the damage didn't look to be the work of ``a
couple of guys going around with a blowtorch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is people taking the law into their own hands,'' Wood
said. ``I would like to think it was some wacko who is keyed into
(the expansion). That would be a lot easier to swallow than if it
was organized.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators refused to speculate on the exact timing of the
fire alarms that alerted officials to the fires. The fires were set
in two groups on two peaks separated by a 1 1/2-mile saddle
overlooking the back bowls.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not go off simultaneously, there was a time lapse,''
said Andree, adding that authorities would use information gleaned
about the timing of the fires in their investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The fires will not affect a planned Nov. 6 opening of the ski
resort or the World Alpine Ski Championships slated for late
January and the first half of February, Witt said. The fires won't
affect expansion construction, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary construction tasks include placing fencing, crossing
Two Elk creek and some timber clearing, Witt said. The expansion
into 885 acres of skiable terrain has been approved by U.S. Forest
Service and is scheduled to open some time during the 2000-2001 ski
season.
</P>
<P>
   And while some Minturn residents said the fires were the natural
result of a community pushed too far by a multi-million dollar
business interest, others decried the tactic of arson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us abhor terrorism, and that's what this is,'' said
Alan Lanning, Minturn's town manager. ``I don't think there's
anything that transpired between us and Vail Associates that would
warrant that kind of action.''

AMTRAK SABOTAGE CASE DISSOLVED
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors two years ago were building a case against
sus pects in the 1995 Amtrak derailment southwest of Phoenix,
according to the forewoman of the grand jury that heard evidence in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects were part of a ``small, close-knit group'' who
lived in the area of the derailment, said Betty J. Teague, an
Ahwatukee resident who led the panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they had an idea of who it was, but they couldn't put
it together with hard evidence,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One person was killed and 78 injured as nine cars of the Sunset
Limited tumbled into a dry wash.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the U.S. Attor ney's Office in Phoenix said he
could not comment on the case, which has frustrated investigators
for three years.
</P>
<P>
   But while it returned indictments in the high-profile Viper
Militia case and dozens of other cases, Teague's grand jury was
never asked to vote on an indictment in the Amtrak case. It was
dismissed last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Teague's grand jury was empan eled in the fall of 1995, shortly
after the Amtrak derailment, which spawned a massive FBI probe.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators hunted in vain for the saboteurs who pulled 29
rail spikes, pried the tracks apart, and used a wire to bypass an
electrical system that would have warned the crew of a break.
</P>
<P>
   A cryptic letter found at the scene and signed by ``Sons of the
Ge stapo'' began with a reference to the federal siege at the
Branch Davidian cult's enclave near Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe the letter was a ruse and that the likely motive
was revenge against Amtrak or the Southern Pacific Railroad that
owns the track.
</P>
<P>
   Teague said the grand jury heard evidence about ``a small,
close-knit group of people who spend their weekends drinking a lot
of beer and commiserating'' in the Hyder area.
</P>
<P>
   But it ultimately led nowhere, Teague said.
</P>
<P>
   The Amtrak story took another turn this month as investigators,
acting on a tip, sought evidence in an abandoned mine shaft west of
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Phoenix bureau spokesman Jack Callahan said Tuesday that
``There are materials that came out of that hole that we'll be
sending back to the (FBI) lab'' in Washing ton, D.C. Meanwhile, the
FBI added $200,000 to the reward in the case, bringing the total to
$320,000. &QL;

 &HT;    Ailing Brown will try to pitch Game 4
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ When someone asked Padres first baseman Wally Joyner
if teammate Kevin Brown would start tonight's World Series game, he
said with a smile: ``If he can stand up and throw a strike, he
wants the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears the sickly Brown will get the ball in Game 4 as the
Padres basically have no choice but to go with him. Not only are
they down to the Yankees, but the club is just not comfortable
pitching righthander and former Georgia Southern star Joey
Hamilton, who pitched in relief in Game 3 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   So Brown will go on three days' rest after spending much of the
last few days in bed with the flu.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not 100 percent,'' Padres manager Bruce Bochy said of
Brown. ``He still feels the effects. But we're optimistic that
he'll be fine and be OK to go.''
</P>
<P>
   What concerns Bochy is Brown might not be honest with him about
the severity of his sickness. Before Game 1, it was obvious that
Brown was bothered by the flu but told Bochy he was fine. Brown
didn't pitch poorly in that game, taking a 5-2 lead into the
seventh, but he appeared to tire there and came out after one out.
From there, the Padres bullpen blew up and the Yankees won 9-6.
</P>
<P>
   Does Bochy think that Brown will tell him he wants to pitch no
matter what?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'm not confident he's going to be honest with me
knowing the kind of guy Kevin is,'' Bochy said. ``He's going to do
what he thinks is best for the ballclub, for us, and you like for
him to be honest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like (Ken) Caminiti, I'm trying to get him to tell me exactly
where he's at right now, he's caught a little bug or something
here, too. And with the groin injury (Caminiti), I don't know if
he's 100 percent. And at this time, they want to be out there.
They're not going to make any excuses. If they can crawl out there,
they're going to try to do it.''

 &HT;    Torre uses Spencer against lefty
 &HT;    By I. J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Shane Spencer is back.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees rookie, who sparked the team in the American League
division series but wasn't used after struggling early in the
league championship, was in the lineup for Game 4 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The reason was obvious.
</P>
<P>
   In Sterling Hitchcock, the Yankees were facing a left-handed
starter for the first time in the postseason and Qualcomm Stadium
has a relatively short porch in left field, just 327 feet down the
line. Spencer, who hits from the right side, struck out on his
first two at-bats before doubling on his third one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have decided to have the switch-hitters coming off the bench
to pinch hit in case I need them,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said.
``I just felt that Spencer may be more of a power threat hitting
behind (Scott Brosius).''
</P>
<P>
   With the designated hitter not available in the National League
park, the Yankees certainly have a bench full of talent in the
games here, especially with the availability of the right-handed
hitting Chili Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer hit .500 in the ALDS against the Rangers but was
1-for-10 against the Indians and hadn't played in 10 days. Spencer
is from nearby El Cajon and Torre was asked if that had anything to
do with his lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you wouldn't have told me that yesterday I wouldn't have
known anything about it,'' he said. ``No, I did it strictly on
hopefully the ability of putting the right guy in left field.''
</P>
<P>
   Field in brutal shape
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the San Diego State football team and the NFL
Chargers, the field was torn up and looked terrible for Game 3. The
only reason it was green was because the ground crew dumped 10,000
gallons of green vegetable dye on it. Even Yankees owner George
Steinbrenner said, ``The Chargers must have some hellish running
backs. When I was coaching in the Big Ten, I never saw a field this
bad. It is like a cow pasture.''
</P>
<P>
   Thinking of dad
</P>
<P>
   Yankees left-hander Andy Pettitte, who will get the start in
Game 4 tonight, has certainly had his mind on other things. His
father recently underwent heart bypass surgery. How difficult will
it be for him to concentrate?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I think if I would have had to throw in New York, it
would have been real difficult,'' Pettitte said. ``But I had a
chance to talk to him (Tuesday) and he is feeling 100 percent
better. I feel great about everything back home and I don't think
it is going to be a problem at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the horn
</P>
<P>
   There were quite a few celebrities in attendance, including
tennis star Lindsay Davenport, Chargers quarterback Ryan Leaf,
country music singer Tricia Yearwood, who performed the national
anthem, actress Gillian Anderson of ``The X-Files,'' husband and
wife Matthew Broderick and Sarah Jessica Parker and Hollywood bad
boy Charlie Sheen. ... Qualcomm Stadium is the first park to host a
Super Bowl and a World Series in the same year.

CASA GRANDE WATER PANIC DISSIPATES  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By GRACIELA SEVILLA  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CASA GRANDE, Ariz. _ Students by the hundreds dutifully carried
bottles of purified water to school Tuesday as people in the city
struggled to get by without a clean municipal water supply.
</P>
<P>
   Gone was the panic after Monday's alert that dangerous bacteria
were found in the water delivered to the town by the Arizona Water
Co. It was replaced with the concern and frustration of families
and businesses forced to cope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't let my kids take their baths Monday night, and I had
them use bottled water to wash their faces,'' said LaVonna Queen, a
hairdresser who ignored health officials' assurances that the water
was safe for bathing.
</P>
<P>
   Queen, who bought seven gallons of purified water Tuesday, said
she even switched to bottled water for her three cats' drinking
bowls.
</P>
<P>
   In a public notice issued Monday, the water company noted that
people who drink water contaminated by fecal coliform may
experience diarrhea, cramps, nausea and jaundice.
</P>
<P>
   Local doctors and the Casa Grande Regional Medical Center
reported dozens of calls from people complaining of illness. But
hospital officials said lab results require at least 48 hours and
said there had been no confirmed cases yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very much a concern when you have the whole town on
alert,'' said Jova Bollig, office manager for Dr. John Hughes'
medical practice.
</P>
<P>
   With tap water off limits, restaurants and bars could not use
their soda fountains and were finding other ways to quench
customers' thirsts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't use the soda machine because it uses the same water
the city uses, and we had to stop selling soda,'' said Lawrence
Bowles, assistant manager of a Burger King.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday afternoon, while clerks ran to the grocery story for
two-liter bottles of soda, Bowles dashed out to buy purified ice.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping at Desert Water &AMP; Ice, the city's only commercial
purified water retailer, Bowles loaded up his pickup with 375
pounds of bagged ice cubes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should get us through the night,'' he said
optimistically.
</P>
<P>
   Although the water crisis was a headache for some, it was a
bonanza for water-store owner Leonard Massey.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed everyone in town, including the elementary school
district, went to Massey's store with whatever empty containers
they could find to stock up on clean water.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Monday) was the biggest day we'd every had,'' he said. ``You
couldn't even walk in this store it was so busy.''
</P>
<P>
   Twice on Monday, the store's 800-gallon tank was drained and the
store was temporarily closed until more water could be sanitized by
reverse osmosis, an ultraviolet laser and processing through a
series of eight filters, Massey said.
</P>
<P>
   Among Tuesday's customers was Enrique Espinoza, head custodian
for Cottonwood Elementary School who filled 10-gallon water coolers
to supply classrooms today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shut off all the school's drinking fountains as soon as we
heard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Until further notice, all district schools are purchasing
purified water and keeping drinking fountains shut off, district
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Casa Elementary School District Superintendent Frank
Davidson sent a note home asking parents to help during the crisis
``by sending their children to school with their own personal
supply of purified water for each day.''
</P>
<P>
   Queen is one mom who said she doesn't mind taking the
precaution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We usually don't drink the city water anyway because we don't
like the taste,'' she said. ``I send my kids to school with their
own water bottle every day.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Yankees put Padres in headlock
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Not even Trevor Hoffman can stop these Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   In a World Series that all but ended on a Scott Brosius home run
here in the eighth inning, the Yankees came clawing back from a
three-run deficit and knocked off the Padres 5-4 in Game 3 Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Like the opening game, the Padres could have won this one only
their bullpen collapsed again, this time the great Hoffman himself
taking the dive.
</P>
<P>
   With Brosius going deep twice and closer Mariano Rivera hanging
on in a tense final two turns of the bat for the Padres, the
Yankees now lead the Series three games to none and no team has
ever made up such a deficit.
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 starter Kevin Brown will try to extend the Series another
day when he takes the mound tonight for the Padres. But whether it
happens in Game 4 or in one of the final these games, the Yankees
don't look like they are going to be denied their 24th world title
and second in three years.
</P>
<P>
   They just don't quit. Sterling Hitchcock had them down 3-0,
those runs coming in the sixth off Yankees righthander David Cone,
who had held the Padres hitless for five innings.
</P>
<P>
   But in the seventh, the problems began for Hitchcock, the
postseason darling for San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius hit the first of his two homers, a solo shot. Rookie
Shane Spencer would follow with a double and Hitchcock was gone.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees would score another in the inning and Padres manager
Bruce Bochy, obviously not very confident in his bullpen, went to
Hoffman in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   To the AC/DC song of ``Hells Bells'', Hoffman took the field and
the 64,677 at Qualcomm Stadium have rarely been louder. But it was
apparent very quickly that Hoffman didn't have his best stuff.
</P>
<P>
   He walked Paul O'Neill and Bernie Williams then drove a ball to
deep right which Tony Gwynn caught on the warning track.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman then had problems just getting the ball to the plate
against Tino Martinez, finally walking him. Up walked Brosius, who
has come up with one big hit after another. And none may ever be
bigger in his career as he drilled a Hoffman fastball over the wall
in center field for a two-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres would score one in the bottom of the inning as
Yankees manager Joe Torre also brought in his closer (Rivera)
early.

EDITORIAL: A MESSY BUDGET ENDGAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Oct. 21:
</P>
<P>
   Few actions have brought more discredit on the 105th Congress
than the frantic deal-making that surrounded the budget
negotiations over the last few weeks. Pressed on by their leaders,
legislators are holding their noses and approving a sprawling, $500
billion measure that includes provisions they have not even read,
much less studied, from grants for the Red Cross and the Tennessee
Valley Authority to special favors for truckers and the peanut
industry.
</P>
<P>
   When the Democrats were in charge of Congress a decade ago,
President Reagan dropped one of these omnibus spending measures,
weighing 43 pounds, on the lectern during a State of the Union
Message and told Congress never to send him another one. This year,
President Clinton was eager to sign because he had achieved many of
his most important goals, from eliminating several anti-environment
riders to new money for schoolteachers, the International Monetary
Fund and distressed farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are also enjoying watching conservative Republicans
fulminate over the way their own party stuffed the bill with costly
pet projects. Indeed, one of the more prominent casualties in this
process was the quaint notion that the Republicans are the only
reliable champions of smaller government. The budget contains
unnecessary spending for drug interdiction in Latin America and
various ill-advised military projects like covert operations in
Iraq and missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   The budget process all but collapsed this year for three
reasons. First, the Republican leadership was so divided that for
the first time since the budget reforms of the 1970s, the House and
Senate were unable to agree on a unified set of spending ceilings.
Second, Republicans who had pinned their election hopes on
Clinton's impeachment problems simply failed to build a case for
their policies, particularly tax cuts. Finally, a projected $70
billion surplus meant that all sides exceeded the spending caps
enacted last year simply by calling $20 billion worth of items
``emergencies.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Congress allowed a handful of legislators and White
House aides, meeting behind closed doors, to approve one-third of
the overall $1.7 trillion federal budget. It was a dangerously
arbitrary process that produced large excesses as well as small
absurdities like the fracas over a government directive requiring
peanut-free zones on some airline flights to protect passengers
with allergies.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama said the directive, which was
repealed after fierce lobbying by the peanut industry, was an
example of ``why so many people have come to resent and distrust
government.'' He could just as easily have been referring to the
entire way in which Congress handled the budget. &QL;

WATER REGULATORS TOUT SAFETY OF ARIZONA SUPPLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE YOZWIAK  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Take another sip of Arizona tap water, say Arizona water
regulators, who maintain the water provided by municipal and
private systems is very good to excellent.
</P>
<P>
   But the problems this week that left 30,000 residents in central
Arizona with undrinkable water could strike at any time,
environmentalists warn.
</P>
<P>
   Orders to boil water before drinking, or use water from
somewhere else, remain in effect Wednesday for Casa Grande and
Arizona City customers of the Arizona Water Co., said Amy
Rezzonico, spokeswoman for the Arizona Department of Environmental
Quality.
</P>
<P>
   Tests on Tuesday showed 24 of 39 samples were clean of total or
fecal coliform, indicators of potentially deadly and
disease-causing bacteria. Analysis of 15 more test samples will not
be completed until today, at the earliest, Rezzonico said.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Dexel of Arizona Water Co. said he felt confident that,
after flushing the water systems for most of Tuesday, that the
boil-water notice would soon be lifted, a source of the
contamination identified and a solution put in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have done, at this point, everything we can. We have
provided a good service to the community, and we will do so in the
future. This is an unfortunate event,'' Dexel said.
</P>
<P>
   The public health notice issued by DEQ on Monday sent Casa
Grande residents scurrying to local stores to buy bottled water,
some thing many Valley residents already do.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys by Arizona State University show three out of four
Valley residents drink either bottled or filtered water, and only
one in four drinks water from the tap. Reasons vary from concern
over water quality to the high mineral content and questionable
taste of Valley tap water.
</P>
<P>
   The Casa Grande water-contamination comes as Valley cities and
towns are in the midst of a campaign to assure their customers that
Valley tap water is safe to drink and tastes good, too, if you
chill it first.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's excellent,'' Bing Brown, spokesman for Phoenix Water
Services Department, said of the city's tap water. Brown said the
public is being ``horribly misled'' by ``scare tactics'' used by
firms marketing water and water filtration systems.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix water customers next month will begin receiving a
six-page notice detailing efforts to ensure their water safety.
</P>
<P>
   Valley cities this month launched a ``Tap Into Quality''
campaign that emphasizes the more than 100 quality tests Valley
water undergoes to meet county, state and federal water standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did some research that shows there is a misconception about
the safety of tap water,'' said DeEtte Person, a spokesperson for
Scottsdale and the ``Tap Into Quality'' campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they don't like the taste. We just want them to make an
informed decision.''
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists contend that what happened this week in
Casa Grande could happen anywhere in Arizona, and already has in
some places.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Driscoll, state director of Arizona Citizen Action, the
state's largest consumer-environmental group, said Congress and the
Legislature need to do more to ensure water quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, the water that comes through our pipes is
susceptible to this kind of (bacteria) problem. We've been pushing
for tighter standards and tighter monitoring, and there's been
resistance on the part of Congress to providing that kind of
protection,'' Driscoll said.
</P>
<P>
   Several studies in recent years have recorded problems with
Arizona water, especially in rural areas:
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Citizen Action and the Washington, D.C.,-based
Environmental Working Group issued a report, ``Just Add Water,''
that ranked Arizona fifth-worst in violations of the federal Safe
Drinking Water Act. The report showed that more than 1.2 million
Arizonans and more than 50 million Americans had been exposed in
the previous two years to water that at one point or another had
failed to meet federal health standards. Disease-causing
microorganisms annually kill an estimated 1,000 people and cause 7
million illnesses nationwide, the report said. Water problems in
Milwaukee in 1993 left more than 100 people dead and nearly 400,000
ill.
</P>
<P>
   A federal report in 1996 also found that more than 100,000
Arizonans in 50 rural communities suffered from ``critical
drinking-water problems.''
</P>
<P>
   A state report two years ago estimated that it already has cost
more than $445 million to clean up polluted underground water
wells, and that is may cost billions to clean up hundreds more.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to improve Arizona water quality, the Legislature
last year authorized DEQ personnel to collect samples and conduct
tests for Arizona's small water systems. The Centralized Monitoring
Program was to start this year.
</P>
<P>
   But the Legislature _ led by members concerned about adding more
state workers _ scrapped the plan in favor of a Monitoring
Assistance Program, in which private contractors would collect
water samples. The legislation, which Gov. Jane Hull allowed to
take effect without her signature, also gave $500,000 to water
trade associations to help conduct the tests for the smallest water
firms, those with fewer than 200 customers.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Water Co. serves 20 other Arizona communities, including
parts of Apache Junction, Pinetop and Globe-Miami, with nearly
166,000 total water customers. &QL;

<P>
   If there is a commonly followed barometer of the wealth of
universities, it is surely Harvard's endowment, which, thanks to
generous donors and the long stock market boom of the 1990s, stood
close to $13 billion at the end of June, more than the gross
national product of most developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   No other college or university comes close. Still, from the
University of Texas system (the second richest, with $7.6 billion)
to Princeton to the University of California, other wealthy
colleges and universities have seen their endowments soar. A dozen
now have $3 billion or more, up from six just two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent market slump _ including losses taken on some
hedge funds and other investments _ many of these institutions are
beginning to loosen their purse strings and spend some of their
newly acquired bounty. Tuition increases are being moderated.
Financial aid packages are being sweetened. Faculty members are
getting more money for research. Academic initiatives are bursting
forth, frequently with new laboratories or classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard recently said it would give larger scholarships and
reduce the size of its nonlecture classes. Yale is adding faculty
slots for the first time in years. Washington University in St.
Louis is creating a department of biomedical engineering. Rice
University in Houston is adding majors in biophysics and
bioengineering. The University of Chicago will spend about half a
billion dollars on an athletic center, two dormitories and a center
for the biological and physical sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Hugo F. Sonnenschein, president of the University of Chicago,
sums it up succinctly: ``The world is much better for us now, as it
is for colleges and universities everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   For universities like Stanford, the new era is particularly
welcome. ``In the early 90s we had cost cutting,'' said John Ford,
Stanford's vice president for development. ``Now we have come
around that corner and are making strategic investments.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the public outcry over tuition costs, many private
colleges and universities are using some of their extra revenue to
moderate the growth in tuition _ which is still rising faster than
inflation _ and to raise financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   But wholesale tuition cuts are unlikely. For one thing,
relatively few colleges and universities have any significant
endowment, and most have established policies that restrict them to
spending only a small part of their wealth each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to pay out so much that you beggar future
generations, or so little that you beggar the current one,'' said
Dean Currie, vice president for finance and administration at Rice,
which saw its endowment grow 51 percent to $2.8 billion as of June,
and is adding new buildings for the humanities and the biosciences.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, universities try to even out the impact of booms and
busts. They usually spend no more than about 4 or 5 percent of
their assets a year _ even if investment gains for the year equal
20 or 25 percent of their assets _ and they base their calculation
of average assets over three, four or five years.
</P>
<P>
   This caution means that the market run-up of the last few years
has translated into higher spending only very slowly, and in many
places that spending is just becoming visible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tend to be very careful,'' said Rebecca S. Chopp, the
provost at Emory University in Atlanta, which has seen its
endowment increase to $5 billion in June from $3 billion two years
ago. ``We want to be here for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Most universities are embracing a number of priorities,
including old themes, like financial aid and salaries, and some
newer ones, like bioengineering departments and international
studies.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the public outcry over tuition costs, many private
colleges and universities are using some of their extra revenue to
moderate the growth in tuition and to raise financial aid.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Williams College, for example, which raised its tuition by 4.6
percent last year, held its increase to 3.5 percent this year _ its
lowest increase in about 25 years. Like many other colleges,
Williams also decided to allow students to keep all outside
scholarships, rather than partly reducing its own scholarship aid
for each dollar they bring in from the outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the extra money has done is enabled us to respond to some
pressures,'' said Stuart Crampton, the college's provost.
</P>
<P>
   Building and maintenance, an area that colleges and universities
often skimp on in tight years, is also getting new emphasis. Even
universities like Columbia that are already in the middle of major
building programs are beginning to dream about further building.
</P>
<P>
   ``The remarkable endowment returns of the past few years will
allow us to continue projecting further investments in
facilities,'' said George Rupp, Columbia's president. Columbia is
expanding undergraduate housing, rehabilitating its library and
building a new student center.
</P>
<P>
   Emory has found that the added dollars from the market are
helping it move faster on its strategic plan. Besides creating new
scholarships, it has put $1 million a year into improving teaching,
and an additional $250,000 a year into sending faculty members and
graduate students overseas and to bring foreign visitors to its
campus.
</P>
<P>
   A few universities are liberalizing their spending formulas.
Washington University, which saw its endowment increase 52 percent
in the last two years, to $3.5 billion, is permitting the spending
of an extra $7 million in its $850 million budget.
</P>
<P>
   The university is adding new buildings and has increased
financial aid. ``Perhaps we would have done the same things without
this growth,'' said Mark S. Wrighton, Washington's chancellor,
``but not as quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, when financial crises shook Asia last year, the
university was able to tell students it could help them if needed.
About 600 of its 10,000 students are from Asia.
</P>
<P>
   University officials caution that some of the changes may loom
larger symbolically than in reality. At Yale, for example, the
decision to add new faculty positions for the first time since 1992
seemed to represent a major policy shift. But Charles H. Long, the
deputy provost, said the university made the decision because it
saw a particular ``opportunity to make a difference'' by giving the
political science department six new openings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a series of retirements over the last decade that
had taken some of the luster off the department, and relative to
student interest, it was very understaffed,'' Long said.
</P>
<P>
   Even with larger endowments, not all universities feel richer.
</P>
<P>
   At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the extra income
from the higher endowment is helping to offset reductions in
federal research money, said Glenn P. Strehle, the university's
treasurer and vice president for finance.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's impacting everybody,'' he said, ``but it is impacting
us more, since a larger portion of our budget comes from sponsored
research.''
</P>
<P>
   Strehle said MIT had to replace about $55 million a year in
revenue. ``For us,'' he said, ``the question is not how flush we
are, but how tight the belt is.''

CSUN GETS SCREAM THERAPY AT PRACTICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The glazed look was still present. The right cross
to the chin landed 72 hours ago, but Cal State Northridge continued
to go through Tuesday's practice shell-shocked from Saturday's loss
to Sacramento State.
</P>
<P>
   That's why CSUN coach Ron Ponciano's voice bellowed across the
North Campus practice fields Tuesday afternoon, barking mostly at a
defense that missed tons of tackles and gave up 258 yards rushing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our kids have responded to adversity in the past,'' Ponciano
said. ``The plan was that the assistants were going to get on them
real hard and I was going to rub them up, but apparently they
weren't getting on them enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I took over a couple of drills and starting getting on
them, and they responded right. Then the coaches can see what I
want done.''
</P>
<P>
   Montana State is four days away, but the 24th-ranked Matadors
(4-2, 3-1 Big Sky) are trying to get over a 35-21 loss that
continues to sting. And when you can't shake a three-day-old
hangover, it makes it difficult for the Matadors to fight for a
playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the yelling was good,'' CSUN receiver Aaron Arnold
said. ``Guys were a little down on themselves, and even though
yelling will usually get you more down, I think yelling in this
situation will get you more up. This is showing us that the coaches
really care and they want to win just as much as we do.''
</P>
<P>
   __ The moveable force: When Ponciano looked at the Sacramento
State game film, he offered this opinion on the defensive line:
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of the time we got blown off the ball,'' Ponciano
said. ``That's pretty disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Matadors got back to the basics of taking on a block
during Tuesday's practice and will concentrate more on stopping
Montana State's running game, which is averaging 138 yards per
game.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN junior nose guard Mike Colunga didn't make the trip to
Sacramento State, but will play against Montana State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think coach Ponciano brought me here to play run defense,''
the 6-foot-2, 290-pound Colunga said. ``That's what I do. I play
run defense. That's my job. I just have to stay low. I'm in a
position where I get double-teamed a lot. I always try to fight
through and stay low, and if I have to I'll eat grass and let the
linebackers (make tackles).''
</P>
<P>
   The rotation of the defensive line will be settled later in the
week, but that's not the only place where change is being made.
Kenny Knoop, a senior from John Burroughs High, saw time at
linebacker and could fit into the Matadors' scheme this week.
</P>
<P>
   __ Triage unit: Nonparticipants in Tuesday's practice were
offensive linemen Beau Cherry (ankle), Julio Alcala (personal) and
Mike Barnes (shoulder), nose guard Quinton Reed (knee), linebackers
Jack Heaslet (ankle) and Shayne Blakey (elbow) and wide receiver
Jimmy Greninger (thigh). Ponciano said Barnes and Blakely, most
likely, won't play.

   Fool me twice, shame on me. Texas Tech 13, Texas A&AMP;M 10 (1996).
</P>
<P>
   Fool me three times . Texas Tech 16, Texas A&AMP;M 13 (1997).
</P>
<P>
   Why is there no familiar saying for the third time?
</P>
<P>
   Probably because if it happens a third time, you were not fooled
at all. No, somebody just took advantage of you.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Raiders didn't fool the Aggies the past three years.
Nope, they just beat 'em, plain and simple.
</P>
<P>
   They have yet to ``beat 'em like a borrowed mule,'' as Texas
Tech coach Spike Dykes is wont to say when someone betters his
squad, but they have beaten them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been fortunate and had some good things happen to us and
had some big plays,'' Dykes said. ``I think it's one of those deals
that we have great respect for them. When you have great respect
for them, sometimes it brings out the best in you.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know they have a good program and a good team, and we're
gonna have to put our best foot forward to have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech is the only team to compile three consecutive victories
against the Aggies in the R.C. Slocum era.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is the only other team that even has three wins against
Slocum-coached teams, with its best streak against Slocum's Aggies
being consecutive victories in 1995 and '96. Tech is 4-5 against
the Aggies during Slocum's tenure; Texas is 3-6.
</P>
<P>
   The streak started with the ``Zach Thomas'' game in 1995. So
dubbed by Tech sports information director Richard Kilwien, it is
the way everyone else in Lubbock remembers the game as well.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask, ``Were you at the Zach Thomas game?'' Almost everyone
says yes _ Jones Stadium was filled to the hilt with 51,205 that
early-October afternoon _ and no one asks which game.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there were two big scoring plays in Tech's 14-7
victory that year, but one faded to relative obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman receiver Donnie Hart lined up on the left side with a
choice of two routes to run against Aggies senior defensive back
Ray Mickens.
</P>
<P>
   The youngster made the right read and beat Mickens on a nice
fade into the corner of the end zone for a second-quarter touchdown
that tied the game at 7.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Thomas who brought victory to the Red Raiders with an
interception and 23-yard return for a touchdown with 30 seconds
left. And it is Thomas who will always be remembered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zach picks it off, runs it back for a touchdown, and the place
goes crazy,'' Hart said. ``It was pandemonium here _ one of the
biggest plays in Tech history. I caught a touchdown pass in that
game, and nobody remembers it. It's just a side note.''
</P>
<P>
   Hart's first career score might have a slightly less significant
place in history next to Thomas' touchdown, but then-freshman
defensive end Montae Reagor almost made Thomas' play ``the play
that never was.''
</P>
<P>
   Reagor, now the school's all-time sacks leader, did his best to
knock down the pass and remembers the ball just missing his
fingertips before Thomas hauled it in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'll never forget that moment,'' Reagor said. ``I can
still see Zach going around the corner, and then everything just
went wild. You couldn't stand still if you wanted to, there was so
much excitement on the field. It was a very exciting and emotional
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of its amazing finish, the 1995 victory over A&AMP;M will
always have a special place in Tech fans' hearts. It was the teams'
final matchup in the Southwest Conference, and it ended the No.
8-ranked Aggies' 29-game streak without a conference loss.
</P>
<P>
   But the subsequent wins have been no less entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Red Raiders went to College Station and toppled the
revenge-minded Aggies 13-10, thanks to an 81-yard pass play from
Zebbie Lethridge to Sammy Morris with six minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Tech knocked off the 20th-ranked Aggies 16-13 on Tony
Rogers' 47-yard field goal with 19 seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   Is there some secret Tech has to playing so well against A&AMP;M?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just played hard and made big plays down the stretch
that enabled ourselves to be in position to win,'' Reagor said.
``That's what it takes in big ballgames.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need the same approach this year. We have to prepare well,
go out there, play hard and try to correct the mistakes from the
previous games this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Accomplish that, and more memories will be built for the No. 25
Red Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Senior linebacker Kevin McCullar's first significant playing
time came against A&AMP;M in 1996, and he made seven tackles. Last
year, he forced a fumble from Aggies quarterback Randy McCown deep
in Texas A&AMP;M territory to set up Tech's lone touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it has basically been effort,'' McCullar said. ``It's
not that we have better athletes; they have great athletes also. I
think we just put in great effort to best them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, A&AMP;M had always been expected to win, but Zach
made a big play a few years back and since then everything has been
going our way against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we know, though: It's gonna be a battle.''
