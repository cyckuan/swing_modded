<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Deadlock Ahead for Cyprus Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The second round of direct talks
on the Cyprus issue collapsed last Friday, an omen of a fresh
deadlock in the divided island's peace process.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-led five-day talks were held in Glion-sur-Montreaux,
Switzerland, between Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides on the
Greek Cypriot side and the Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash
with an aim to reach a comprehensive solution to the protracted
Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The talks ended in failure as the Turkish Cypriot side insisted
on the suspension by the European Union (EU) of its planned
accession negotiations with Cyprus first.
</P>
<P>
Denktash charged the EU for throwing a "bombshell" into the
peace process by deciding to open access negotiations with Cyprus
next year, while Clerides blamed Denktash for the failure of the
talks.
</P>
<P>
Signs of bad luck for peace process had appeared even before
the start of the Glion negotiations. On July 15 the EU reaffirmed
its accession talks with Cyprus, a step it believes helpful to the
peaceful solution of the island's problem.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus issue has remained unresolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after Turkish troops invaded and took over the
northern third in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with
Greece.
</P>
<P>
But the EU move elicited strong reactions from Turkey and the
Turkish Cypriot side while Denktash threatened a boycott of the
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
In a move apparently designed to cow the EU, Denktash and
Turkish high-ranking officials announced on July 20 a series of
steps toward partial integration of the Turkish occupied northern
Cyprus with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is the only country which recognizes the "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC)" declared by the Turkish
Cypriots unilaterally in 1983.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot side said the Greek Cypriot side
should not negotiate accession with the EU without participation
of the Turkish Cypriot side. They maintained that Cyprus cannot
become a member of the EU before a Cyprus settlement.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus applied for the EU full membership in 1990. The EU
decided in March 1995 that the accession talks with Cyprus would
start six months after the end of the EU Intergovernmental
Conference.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that some EU envoys on the wings of the Glion
direct talks exerted pressure on Denktash to make compromise on
Cyprus' EU accession course and accept a U.N. document on the
talks, but only to be rejected.
</P>
<P>
Still, the U.N. is expected to make fresh peace efforts to
break the deadlock, although there is little hope for a
breakthrough any time before the presidential election scheduled
for next February in government-controlled southern part of the
island, observers said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and international community have been trying for
decades to reunite this island nation as a bi-communal, bi-zonal
federation through peace talks, but so far no tangible results
have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> EMU to Suffer Speculative Attacks: Economist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The European Monetary Union
(EMU), due to be launched on January 1 1999, will offer huge
opportunities for speculators to make millions by attacking the
single currency from the start, according to a leading economist.
</P>
<P>
Former head of Britain's National Economic Development Office
Walter Eltis was quoted by press reports as saying today that the
timetable for the EMU has been designed in such a way that it
offers speculators a free run.
</P>
<P>
Eltis focused on the period between the start of the final
stage of the EMU on January 1 1999 and conversion of national
currencies to the Euro in mid-2002.
</P>
<P>
The big danger is that traders will launch speculative attacks
on vulnerable currencies in an effort to force them out of the new
system, he said.
</P>
<P>
"As soon as the possibility of departure of one or more
countries from EMU between 1999 and 2002 is recognized, movement
towards the D-mark will not be confined to those who are exposed
to weaker currencies through trade or holdings of debt denominated
in their money."
</P>
<P>
"There will be staggering opportunities for profit at the
expense of those who, like the British government in 1992, seek to
hang on to exchange rates which they can not in the end sustain,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the European Union finance ministers and
central bankers have recognised this potential flaw in the final
run-up to the planned single currency, but they are powerless to
do anything about it.
</P>
<P>
However, Eltis noted that once national currencies have been
replaced by the single currency, the EMU system will be safer from
speculators.

ending the sufferings of the Palestinian prisoners in Israeli

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Calls on Iraq to Release Iranian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami today called on Iraq to comply with its international
commitments and free the Iranian prisoners of war (POWs) still
held in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president made the call in a meeting with the
former POWs to mark their return in 1988, according to the
official news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
The POWs is one of the major issues that block the improvement
of bilateral relations between the two former enemies who fought a
bitter war from 1980 to 1988.
</P>
<P>
Iran claimed that Iraq still holds more than 15,000 Iranian
POWs according to the documents it has. But Iraq repeatedly
rejected the claim.
</P>
<P>
Khatami expressed hope that Iraq will abide by its
international commitments and pay reparations for the losses that
its aggression (1980-1988 war) inflicted on Iran.
</P>
<P>
The 54-year-old president voiced deep concern about the fate
of the POWs still languishing in Iraqi prisons, saying "Iran will
do its utmost through international organizations to pressure Iraq
to release all Iranian POWs."
</P>
<P>
On the necessity of peace and security in the region, Khatami
said that "today, the need for consolidating peace in the region
is felt much more than any other time before and that the nations
themselves are able to secure peace in the region."
</P>
<P>
He also called the regional states to solve differences among
themselves peacefully and prepare grounds for development in all
economic, political and cultural areas.

<HEADLINE> Six More Killed in Kenya's Port City Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Six more Kenyans were killed
last night and this morning in the port city of Mombasa, bringing
the death toll to 31 since Wednesday, the Kenya Television
Network (KTN) reported today.
</P>
<P>
Five people were killed and dozens of people injured during
the attacks by more than 100 gangsters at the Shauri Yako slum
area, eight kilometers north of Mombasa.
</P>
<P>
Another person was shot by police and his body burned by angry
villagers Sunday morning after local people in the area raided a
neighboring slum area, accusing the people there of attacking
them.
</P>
<P>
About 100 roadside kiosks and dozens of houses in the Maweni
and Kongowea areas of Mombasa were burned down today by
unidentified attackers.
</P>
<P>
According to the Coast Provincial police officer Francis
Gichuki, the incidents are not connected to the Wednesday night
raid when gangsters killed seven policemen and eight civilians at
Likoni Police Station and Likoni Ferry Tourist Police Unit in
Mombasa.
</P>
<P>
Since the Likoni attack, Kenyan army and navy had joined the
police in the massive manhunt for the gang of marauders and in
recovering weapons and ammunition stolen from the Likoni Police
Station.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan police spokesman Peter Kimanthi said that they had
killed seven of the gangsters, recovered two of the stolen guns
and made 40 arrests.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Lands and Settlement Noah Ngala today told the
Kenya News Agency that Coast Provincial Members of Parliament
would hold a meeting in Mombasa to discuss the continuous
violence during the past five days.
</P>
<P>
The motive of the recent violent attacks in Mombasa is not
clear yet, but local residents said that those killed had mainly
been people who originally came from up-country to the coastal
region.
</P>
<P>
Leaflets distributed in the port city say, "The time has come
for us original inhabitants of the coast to claim what is rightly
ours. We must remove these invaders from our land."

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait today vowed to try
every means to keep out prohibited foreign products, including
those carried by its citizens returning from vacations overseas.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Kuwaitis and foreign employees usually leave
Kuwait on vocation this time of the year every year to get away
from the world's hottest summer there.
</P>
<P>
Director General of Customs Department Ibrahim Abdulla
Al-Ghanim said in a statement to official Kuwait News Agency that
his administration has taken all the necessary precautions and
procedures to avoid the entrance to the country of any prohibited
products.
</P>
<P>
The official specified two lists of all the prohibited
products. One includes 47 items while the other 62 items.
</P>
<P>
The prohibited products include some specified food, drinks,
electrical appliances, firecrackers, military uniforms, mobile
phones exceeding 300 milliwatts, drugs, alcohol and weapons.
</P>
<P>
Other prohibited items to the country include African birds,
Iraqi money, gas cylinders of all sizes as well as obscene
products which offend religion, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Clean-Beach Campaign Launched in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Lebanese today went
out to the beach and joined in the one-day campaign to clean up
the Lebanese coastlines along the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, the biggest clean-up since the end of the civil
war in 1990, was co-organized by the Operation Big Blue
Association (OBBA), the Environment Association and the
non-governmental organizations, with the support of the ministry
of environment, scout organizations and various municipalities.
</P>
<P>
"This is really a national effort. We are fighting for one
cause," said Hazem Idriss, head of OBBA, at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
"Every year, Mediterranean countries clean up their beaches and
every year we are the ones seen as the polluters and are left
out," he said, adding that "this time we will show them otherwise."
</P>
<P>
Idriss, a scuba diving instructor, estimated that at least
25,000 people across the country have taken part in the operation.
</P>
<P>
Besides cleaning up a number of coastlines, he said, the more
important task of the campaign is to draw more attention of the
public to the issue of environment.
</P>
<P>
"The sea is in very bad shape. All industrial, chemical waste
is dumped and accumulates on the bottom of the sea which forms a
chemical mud residue," he said.
</P>
<P>
The rubbish collected today will be sold to Lebanese companies
for recycling in an effort to educate people about waste
reduction, separation and recycling, he added.

<HEADLINE> 5 African States to Establish Economic Grouping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Presidents of five African
countries have agreed in principle to establish a regional
economic grouping among them.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of Libya, Burkina Fasso, Chad, Mali and Niger
reached the consensus during their two-day summit which concluded
in the Libyan capital city of Tripoli Saturday, reports reaching
here today said.
</P>
<P>
The idea was proposed by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in line
with the directives of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
that call for groupings and integration among member states,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that Libya open up its Mediterranean shores
to the land-locked African states so that they might promote their
trade with European and Mediterranean states.
</P>
<P>
Quoting sources close to the summit, the reports added that the
heads of the five African states have agreed to conclude an
economic pact on the establishment of the grouping, and that it
would be signed in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi also invited Tunisia, Algerian, Morocco, Mauritanian
and Egypt to join the proposed grouping. Invitation will also be
addressed to Nigeria to joint the grouping, because the Nigerian
president failed to attend the Tripoli summit for health reasons,
the reports said
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the sources said, the expected pact for the
proposed grouping will have "greater chances of success" as
compared to previous attempts in the field of cooperation among
the coastal Saharan African states. They attributed this to the
fact that "all precautions have been taken" this time.
</P>
<P>
The sources pointed out that Libya would dispatch delegations
to other countries of the region to brief their leaders about the
idea.
</P>
<P>
The reports said the leaders have decided to consolidate ties
among their states, and have charged their foreign ministers to
discuss the practical ways and means to put that into effect.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the concerned states will meet in
September to prepare for the second summit during which the pact
is likely to be endorsed.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President Signs Education Reform Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel today signed a controversy education reform bill into law,
marking the initial victory of the secularists.
</P>
<P>
Demirel wasted no time in signing the eight-year compulsory
education bill which was adopted by the Parliament by a margin of
35 votes Saturday, according to the semi-official Anatolia News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the president made the move to show
his firm support for the Mesut Yilmaz's government, which proposed
the education reform scheme, and other secularists.
</P>
<P>
So far, Demirel has stopped short of making any comment on the
bill.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a rally in Hacibektas, a town in central Anatolian
province this morning, Prime Minister Yilmaz said that the new law
concerning the education system was a gift to the people who back
the country's secularism.
</P>
<P>
The education reform bill, which touched off the strong
opposition from the pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP) and its
followers, was one of the republic' most important bills, Yilmaz
added.
</P>
<P>
This controversial bill was passed in the Parliament by 277 to
242 following a white hot debate, earlier reports said.
</P>
<P>
According to the new law, a large number of religious schools
have to be closed, which is widely seen as a heavy blow to the
conservative Islamists.
</P>
<P>
Students, if they like, have to finish their eight years of
compulsory education before they enter religious schools to
study the Koran.
</P>
<P>
The adoption of the education reform bill enraged RP leader and
former prime minister Necmettin Erbakan, who has tried hard to
block the passage of the Education Ministry-initiated program.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan, who was forced by the military to step down due to his
pro-fundamentalist policies on June 18, said that his party would
set up a special commission which is to appeal to the
Constitutional Court for the annulment of the new law.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a group of Islamic businessmen in Istanbul, the
largest city of Turkey, on Friday, Tansu Ciller, chairwoman of
the opposition True Path Party, also criticized the eight-year
compulsory education plan, describing is as "outdate."
</P>
<P>
Ciller, who served as deputy prime minister in the former
Erbakan government, said that the education reform bill was a
"big trick," adding it would push the country to the edge of
darkness.
</P>
<P>
The Yilmaz government, however, stated that this education
reform bill was extremely important for the continuation of
Turkey's democracy and secularist system, saying it would prevent
fundamentalists from expanding in the secular republic.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish military has voiced its support to Yilmaz and his
government's efforts for the adoption of the significant
bill.

<HEADLINE> Afro-Asian Organization Urges Revival of Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Afro-Asian People's Solidarity
Organization (AAPSO) today appealed to the world community for
saving the Middle East peace process from dangers surrounding it.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo-based AAPSO asked in a statement the United Nations
to send a fact-finding committee to investigate the July 30 blasts
in West Jerusalem and determine those responsible and to explore
policies which would provide a proper climate for peace.
</P>
<P>
Two suicide bombs killed 16 people in a crowded Jerusalem
market just as the two sides prepared to resume peace talks that
have been frozen since March over Israel's construction of a
Jewish housing project in East Jerusalem, a place claimed by the
Palestinians as their future capital.
</P>
<P>
The organization said the recent shuttle tour in the region of
U.S. Mideast Peace Coordinator Dennis Ross did not achieve "any
negligible progress."
</P>
<P>
"Ross came to the area following the blasts in Jerusalem,
ignoring the base of the peace process which had stopped before
the suicide bombings because of Israel's insistence on building
more settlements," it said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Israel was demolishing the homes of
Palestinians in accordance with a plan which is aimed at Judaizing
Palestinian lands on the pretext that they were not licensed.
</P>
<P>
The United States shoulders a big responsibility to save the
peace process, it stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Washington's silence and bias to Israel will contribute to an
explosion of the situation in the Middle East and all chances of
peace will be lost," AAPSO warned in its statement.
</P>
<P>
Ross' intense four-day shuttle diplomacy early this month has
achieved nothing more than helping restore the Palestinian-Israeli
mechanism of security coordination.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has announced she
would make her first trip to the region in the coming few weeks to
push across a major U.S. peace initiative that will focus on
accelerated talks on a final peace settlement and implementation
of the existing Israeli-Palestinian agreements.

<P>
CAIRO, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Afro-Asian Peoples' Solidarity
Organization (AAPSO) today called on the United States and the
United Nations to help salvage the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
"In light of the principles of the international law and
agreements signed between Israel and the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA), the U.S. should step in to save the peace process
from dying," AAPSO said in a message sent to U.S. President Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
It also called for lifting the sanctions imposed on the
Palestinian people after the July 30 suicide bombing attacks in
Jerusalem which killed 16 people, condemning the Israeli measures
as "unjust and irresponsible."
</P>
<P>
The Cairo-based organization today sent a message to PNA
President Yasser Arafat, voicing support for the Palestinians and
denouncing the Israeli policy.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Syria Says Ready to Talk With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Syrian Minister of State
for Foreign Affairs Nasser Qaddour reiterated today that Syria is
prepared to resume negotiations with Israel from the very point
they were suspended.
</P>
<P>
Addressing participants in the political leadership training
seminars of the Feminist Union and the Revolution Youths Union
today, he said that Syria is struggling for the achievement of
just and comprehensive based on international legitimacy
resolutions and the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian minister pointed out that Israel has failed to abide
by the U.N. resolutions stipulating Israeli withdrawal from the
occupied Arab territories.
</P>
<P>
Qaddour emphasized that no one should ever think of the
prevalence of peace without Israeli withdrawal to the June 4, 1967
border lines, and the safeguarding of the established rights of
the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
He praised the positive EU role in the regional peace process,
pointing out that Syria has always welcomed EU participation in
the peace process from the very outset.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Syrian peace negotiations have been frozen since March
last year following a wave of suicide bombing attacks launched by
Islamic extremists against Israel, and tension between the two
countries has been brewing after the hardline Likud government
came to power in Israel in May last year.
</P>
<P>
Israel has repeatedly called for unconditional resumption of
the peace talks, while Syria insists that the negotiations should
restart from the point where they broke off: Israel's promise to
total withdrawal from the occupied Golan heights.

<HEADLINE> Negotiations Between Sudanese Government, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The planned negotiations
between the Sudanese government and the John Garang opposition
movement scheduled Tuesday at the Kenyan capital of Nairobi have
been postponed.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese Foreign Minister Ali Mohamed Taha said he was informed
of the postponement by a cable from the Kenyan foreign ministry.
</P>
<P>
Local radio today quoted Taha as saying the Kenyan government
has not revealed the cause of the postponement.
</P>
<P>
Taha said there might be several factors behind the
postponement, including the fact that Garang's Sudan People's
Liberation Army (SPLA) was not prepared for the negotiations as
announced earlier.
</P>
<P>
The minister criticized some states such as Uganda for carrying
out measures that would harm peace in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government had announced earlier this month that
the second round of negotiations with Garang would take place by
the end of August, under the umbrella of the Inter-Governmental
Authority on Drought and Development (IGADD), which embraces
Sudan, Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia and Djibouti as
members.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government had then expressed readiness to
negotiate with Garang at any place to be fixed by Kenyan President
Daniel Arap Moi, chairman of the current IGADD session.
</P>
<P>
The first round of negotiations brokered within the framework
of IGADD took place last May.
</P>
<P>
The SPLA has been fighting since 1983 for more independence for
the South's animists and Christians from the Islamic North. It
refused to join four other smaller rebel groups in signing a peace
agreement with the government in this April.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu's Adviser Meets Arafat, Praising PNA's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Yitzhak Molcho, Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's attorney, met secretly with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat overnight to commend Palestinian
cooperation in apprehending the murderers of an Israeli taxi
driver, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Molcho and Arafat was held in Gaza
Saturday night following the Palestinian court in Jericho
sentenced three Palestinians earlier in the day for murdering
Israeli cab driver Shmuel Ben Baruch Friday.
</P>
<P>
The court sentenced two of them to life sentence, and the
third 15 years in prison for killing Baruch in order to steal his
car. Molcho reportedly praised the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) for its quick actions in apprehending the murderers.
</P>
<P>
Molcho and Arafat also discussed other political issues,
including further bilateral security cooperation and results of
the just-concluded visit by United States peace envoy Dennis Ross
last week.
</P>
<P>
Upon his return to Washington Wednesday, Ross described the
restoration of Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation as one of
the major achievements of his four-day shuttle mission.
</P>
<P>
Despite the compliments on the PNA for its actions in smashing
the murder case, Molcho still demanded Arafat take more steps to
fight Islamic militant groups, such as Islamic Resistance Movement
(Hamas) and Islamic Jihad, as well as their infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Israeli, Palestinians and
U.S. security officials are scheduled to hold a new round of
talks Sunday night in the West Bank's Palestinian city Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Jibril Rajoub and Mohammed Dahlan, the heads of Palestinian
Preventive Forces in West Bank and Gaza Strip, will discuss
further security cooperation with Ami Ayalon, chief of Israel's
General Security Service, and officials from the U.S. Central
Intelligence Agency station based in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
This meeting is another positive sign for further thawing of
the chilly Israeli-Palestinian relations since the twin suicide
bombings in Jerusalem on July 30, which killed 16 people and
forced the cancellation of the originally set resumption of peace
talks. Hamas has claimed responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
Israel is demanding for PNA's specific steps to launch a
long-term crackdown on terrorist organizations and their
infrastructure as a precondition for resuming the peace
process.

<HEADLINE> China's Transportation Tends to Ease Economic Bottlenecks (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- China has basically formed a
nationwide comprehensive transportation network to ease the
bottleneck the formerly-lagging sector created in the national
economy in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Since the 14th National Congress of the Communist Party of
China was held in 1992, total passenger transport volume has
increased by an annual average of 9.1 percent to end at 12.45
billion people in 1996, while passenger turnover reached 914.2
billion person/km, an average rise of 8.2 percent, according to a
report recently released by the State Statistics Bureau (SSB).
</P>
<P>
Cargo volume amounted to 12.96 billion tons, an average growth
of 5.6 percent, while cargo turnover enjoyed an average rise of
5.4 percent to stand at 3.64 trillion ton/km.
</P>
<P>
The cargo handling capacity at major coastal ports had been
increased from 530 million tons to 850 million by the end of last
year, rising by an average 9.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Priority was given to railway and highway construction to
improve transportation structure.
</P>
<P>
During the period, 148.4 billion yuan was spent on railway
construction to expand the total mileage to 117,618 km, with an
average increase of 2.3 percent. Nearly a third of them had
double-track rails and 17.4 percent were electric.
</P>
<P>

Some 145,000 km of highways were added in the past five years,
increasing by an average 2.6 percent. At the end of 1996, China
had 3,422 km of expressways, nearly six-fold that of 1991. And
roads ran to all counties, 98 percent of townships and 80 percent
of villages in the country.
</P>
<P>
And in water routes construction, special attention was placed
on key projects and loading capacity improvements of containers
for major cargo. As a result, China now boasts world-standard
freighters to convey containers.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, there were 406 10,000-ton deepwater berths at major
coastal ports at the end of 1996, and 1,703 docks and berths at
inland waters.
</P>
<P>
Aviation infrastructure has taken giant leaps during the
five-year period, with 21 new airports added and another 21
extended, bringing the total number of airports to 142 by the end
of last year. China had 449 airplanes for air transportation and
876 air routes, with 1.63 million km of mileage in operation in
136 cities. It has also opened air service to 58 cities abroad.
</P>
<P>
The transport and communications sector began to raise money to
ease capital shortage pressure. By the first half of this year,
the sector had five enterprises listed on overseas stock markets,
to raise some 11 billion yuan of funds.
</P>
<P>
The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) has formed
three enterprise groups and begun share-holding system experiments
with other companies. And by the end of last year, CAAC had hired
241 airplanes and used 11.8 billion US dollars of overseas
investment.

JERUSALEM -- In a move to break the ice in the
Israeli-Palestinian ties, Israel decided today to release 30
percent of tax revenues frozen following the recent terror
bombings in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the move
following consultations with Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
and Foreign Minister David Levy.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the July 30's twin suicide bombings in
Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market which killed 16 people and
wounded 170 others, Israel immediately retaliated by imposing
sanctions on the Palestinians, including a total closure and
freezing the transfer of 14 million dollars in tax revenues it
collected from Palestinians on the behalf of the Palestinian
National Authority.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's spokesman Shai Bazak said that Israel's step to
release part of the tax money was "a return for some steps" taken
by the PNA for its cooperation in investigating the Mahane Yehuda
Bombing and Palestinian police's quick action in apprehending
three Palestinians who killed an Israeli taxi driver last week.

BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- China National Petroleum
Corporation (CNPC) and Enron Oil &AMP; Gas (China) Ltd. signed here
today a contract on the joint development of oil and natural gas
resources in southwest China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
According to the contract, Enron as the sole operator is fully
responsible for the drilling in the pilot test period and
shoulders all investment risks. The contract is the widely-used
product-sharing agreement.
</P>
<P>
Located north of Suining and Nanchong prefectures in Sichuan,
the resources block occupies an area of 7,525 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
CNPC started the oil and gas exploration in the Chuanzhong
block in the 1950s. Due to the complicated geographical
conditions, the exact area of oil-bearing layer and actual oil and
gas reserve still have not been confirmed.
</P>
<P>
In term of technical difficulty, work to be done in the block
is the most complicated ever done by a foreign company in China.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Yongkang, president of CNPC, said, "Any breakthrough made
by this Sino-US cooperative project would surely have a positive
impact on the further development of oil and gas resources in the
central part of the province."

Another "one man march" by human rights activist lawyer
Sulaiman Banja Tejan Sie was also banned by police.
</P>
<P>
The streets of the capital Freetown remain clear except
security vehicles, with traders at the central market reduced to
a minimum.
</P>
<P>
Inspector General of Police Teddy Williams in a statement
broadcast over state radio, banned the march "in consideration of
the general security situation" in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
"All security forces are on alert throughout the country to
ensure that absolute law and order is maintained," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The president of NUSS, Ibrahim Jalloh speaking to Xinhua from
a hideout in the capital said in a defiant mood, "we shall
demonstrate whether the authorities like it or not. We don't want
an illegal government and they should hand back power to the
civilian government."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a press release issued today, the Ministry of
Education accused students residing in campuses in two colleges
in the capital, of "hatching the mobilization plans" for today's
march.
</P>
<P>
Schools and colleges have been closed unofficially since the
coup by education officials who said they will reopen in October.
</P>
<P>
Today's statement asked "those students still remaining in
campuses to leave immediately or face the consequences."
</P>
<P>
About 100 foreign students, mainly from west and eastern
Africa as well as from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
will be affected.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the task force commander of the West African Peace
Keeping Force (ECOMOG), colonel Max Khobe, has denied the
involvement of Nigeria in today's march.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview, Khobe said, "we are not involved. We
are here on a specific mandate to help restore civilian rule to
the country."
</P>
<P>
"If it is determined that the activities of the illegal
military Government pose a grave threat to the lives of innocent
civilians, then ECOMOG may be forced to take swift and decisive
action to eliminate the threat," he added.
</P>
<P>
Asked when Nigerians troops, now occupying the country's
airport, would leave, he said, "We will not move until (ousted
president) Tejan Kabbah is restored to power."
</P>
<P>
The outburst of heavy gunfire caused commotion in the city
itself, sending people rushing for shelter and local markets to
close.
</P>
<P>
Gunners from the Sierra Leone navy fired back toward the
airport from their depot in the city center.

<HEADLINE> Italian-Run Hospital in Somalia Attacked, 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Three Somali guards at the
Italian-run hospital in Jalalaqsi district have been killed
following an attack by unidentified gunmen.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the local radios in Jalalaqsi district of Hiran
region, about 200 kilometers North of Mogadishu, said the attack
came last week when three Italian doctors are operating in the
hospital, but none was hurt.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports all three expatriates working for the
Italian aid agency, Committato Europeo Fundo Agricolo (CEFA), in
the hospital were evacuated temporarily to the neighboring town
of Jowhar.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the attack against the hospital remains
obscure. However, sources say disputes over the administration of
the hospital by local Somalis have prompted the attack.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, local elders from the region are reported to be
working on ways to ease the tension and prevent further attacks
against the hospital.
</P>
<P>
The elders are also planning for the possibilities of
redeploying the evacuated doctors who are still in Jowhar town
for security precautionary measures.
</P>
<P>
In another development, some unidentified Somali gunmen have
opened fire on a civilian vehicle working for a local
humanitarian agency known as ADRA-SAACID in Burane village, 23 km
North of Jowhar town Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitness, two of the bodyguards of the vehicle
were killed and the driver was wounded as the result of the
shooting carried out by gunmen manning a checkpoint outside the
village.
</P>
<P>
It is not yet known the motive behind the attack. But local
authorities in Jowhar district, 90 km north of Mogadishu,
described the incident as an isolated incident which is part of
the banditry attacks.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Nusrat's Death, National Loss to Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani textile city of
Faisalabad, about 200 km south of here, was plunged into mourning
as the country's music maestro Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan was laid to
rest there Sunday afternoon at his ancestral graveyard.
</P>
<P>
Nusrat, who fused western rhythms into a mystic, classical
style of chorus singing called "Qawali" in the subcontinent, died
Saturday at 49 of a heart attack arising from Kidney problems in
London.
</P>
<P>
The legendary musician and singer, who was on his way to the
United States for kidney transplant operation, died on the same
date on which the king of Rock and Roll, Elvis Presley, had died
exactly 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of wailing people including a large number of fans,
musicians and relatives late Sunday attended the funeral
procession of the legendary singer in Faisalabad and everybody
wanted to give shoulder to the coffin mounted on bamboos,
according to reports monitored here.
</P>
<P>
Many people fainted with grief when having the last sight of
their favorite singer, whose music touched the heart and soul of
the listeners and built a direct rapport with them.
</P>
<P>
Shops in the main markets were closed and the few tea stalls
opened repeatedly played one of Nusrat's hit songs "May No One
Suffer the Agony of Missing a Beloved".
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, funeral prayers attended by senior government
officials were offered at the Data Darbar shrine in Lahore, about
250 km southeast of here, after Nusrat's body was flown in the
capital of the eastern Punjab province from London amid emotional
scenes.
</P>
<P>
Born in Faisalabad in 1948, Nusrat was expected by his father,
a renowned exponent of Qawali, to be a doctor. However, the eldest
son of the family learnt to play the harmonium secretly. The
talented boy joined his family's Qawali party soon after the death
of his father in 1964 and became leader of the group.
</P>
<P>
After being spotted by a radio producer at a festival on March
23, 1965, Nusrat, who had the distinction of popularizing a new
blend of music through a mix of Qawali and technology, began to
enthrall the Pakistani music lovers and later those in India, the
United Kingdom, the United States and several other countries.
</P>
<P>
In Pakistan, his popularity might be gauged by the fact that
Pakistan television regularly invited him to record patriotic
songs to be telecast on the occasions of national importance. His
style of singing always brought emotional climaxes to the
listeners and was regarded as a supreme expression of religious
devotion and worship.
</P>
<P>
Nusrat's international profile took a significant leap in the
late 1980s when he approached by producer Peter Gabriel to sing on
the sound track of Hollywood's film "The Last Temptation of
Christ".
</P>
<P>
The untimely death of Nusrat, was felt deeply in Pakistan.
President Farooq Leghari and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif paid
eloquent tributes, terming his death a "national loss".
</P>
<P>
The All Musicians' Association has declared a three-day
mourning period and announced there would be no recording of any
music programs during that time in memory of Nusrat.
</P>
<P>
"To me his death is a personal loss," said a music researcher
here. "I believe people like him are not meant to live long. They
are like meteors, who burn out very quickly."
</P>
<P>
"In the death of Nusrat, the country has lost one of the
greatest singers, musicians," Culture Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmad
said when expressing his deep grief. "Nusrat has bridged the gap
between Oriental and Western music with his deep understanding of
the art."
</P>
<P>
Another important factor that makes Nusrat's death such a big
tragedy for Pakistanis lies in that he was also a philanthropist.
It is reported that Nusrat had been financially helping some 150
poor families in his home city Faisalabad.
</P>
<P>
"His death had left us orphaned," said the wailing women and
children, to whom Nusrat had been secretly giving monthly
stipends, at Sunday's burial ceremony.

<HEADLINE> China's Housing Policy Successful: Habitat Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Chief of U.N. Center for
Human Settlement (Habitat) today spoke highly of China's housing
policy, saying it has successfully established "a very good
example for the rest of the world".
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has made continuous efforts to build
high-quality houses for people with low incomes, scoring
"tremendous achievements" by constructing nine billion square
meters of floor areas in buildings in the past 10 years, Habitat
Executive Director Wally N'dow told Xinhua here.
</P>
<P>
Infrastructure construction expands very fast in China's big
and medium-sized cities, he said in an interview, citing the
improvement of living conditions in Shanghai and the high-tech
sewerage system in the southern Chinese city of Fushan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he praised China's strategy on township
construction since it has been easing pressures on big cities to
a large extent.
</P>
<P>
The construction of medium- and small-sized towns in China
will make rapid progress and set an example in the human
settlements development in the whole world, he predicted.

MANILA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' current account
soared to 2.02 billion U.S. dollars during the first four months
this year, a 38-percent increase over the same period last year,
the Philippine Central Bank said today.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said a rise in trade deficit and a drop in
services account surplus contributed to the jump in the current
account deficit.
</P>
<P>
During the period under review, the country's trade deficit
expanded 7 percent to 3.71 billion dollars while the surplus in
services account dropped 37.4 percent to 1.45 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Current account summarizes a country's earnings from exports of
goods and services, minors cost of imports. The Philippines'
current account also includes remittances sent home by its
millions of overseas workers.
</P>
<P>
A deficit in current account may lead to a drop in
international reserves, a rise in foreign debt and other economic
problems.

<HEADLINE> China's Coastal Areas Create New Jobs for Laid-Off Workers (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Coastal areas in east China have
been successful in redistributing labor resources and creating new
jobs for laid-off workers, the People's Daily, China's leading
newspaper, reported today.
</P>
<P>
A front page article noted that in the reforms of state-owned
enterprises, re-employment of laid-off workers is a difficult
problem that needs to be handled carefully.
</P>
<P>
Profound changes are taking place in the relationship between
the state, the enterprises and the workers as China turns from a
planned economy to a market economy, the article noted.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990s, the article said, a total of 1.09 million people
in Shanghai, China's largest city, lost their original jobs, but
890,000 of them were offered a new job thanks to the city's
re-employment project.
</P>
<P>
"The scale of labor redistribution in Shanghai over recent
years is larger than the population of a medium-sized city," it
said.
</P>
<P>
It added that in Qingdao and Ningbo, coastal cities in east
China's Shandong and Zhejiang provinces, and in Hangzhou, capital
of Zhejiang Province, more than 10,000 surplus workers from these
cities' traditional textile and silk sectors have entered the
labor market with the help of local "re-employment service
centers."
</P>
<P>
Governments in the coastal areas have realized that shifting
from the traditional industries to various kinds of new markets,
setting up labor service enterprises and developing the service
sector are effective ways to create new job opportunities for the
surplus or laid-off workers, the article acknowledged.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Minister Denies Joint War Games With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Defense Minister
Izmet Sezgin, rejecting an announcement by the foreign ministry,
said Turkey will not hold joint military exercises with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Sezgin was assuring the Arab countries in an interview with a
Kuwaiti newspaper published today.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking to correct a Turkish foreign ministry spokesman
who confirmed Friday a joint operation by Turkish and Israeli
naval forces in the eastern Mediterranean scheduled for October.
</P>
<P>
The planned maneuvers have alarmed Arab states already angered
over military cooperation between Turkey and Israel, Sezgin told
daily Al-Qabas.
</P>
<P>
Sezgin said the "agreements" reached with Israelis earlier this
year were mainly aimed at promoting the two countries' ties in the
field of exchanging military expertise.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Turkey was determined to achieve peace and
stability in the Middle East, adding that his country would not
accept any foreign interference in the Middle East issues.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is one of the few Middle East countries that has been on
good terms with the Jewish state which has angered the whole Arab
world for bringing the Middle East peace process to a stop through
its various anti-Arab policies since the right-wing Likud party
took power in the country last year.

<HEADLINE> China's Coastal Areas Create New Jobs for Laid-Off Workers (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It said that laid-off workers are mostly from the traditional
industries, and their cultural and technical qualities usually
fall far short of the demands of newly-emerged industries,
industries applying high and new technologies and high-grade
service sectors such as information and finance.
</P>
<P>
Many laid-off people prefer to receive meager relief funds than
be engaged in some service jobs which are either risky or hard,
dirty and tiring, it said.
</P>
<P>
The article also noted that most laid-off workers in China
today are aged between 40 and 50, and that many of them graduated
from middle schools during the period of the Cultural Revolution
(1966-1976).
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that among the 43,386 laid-off workers in
Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province, nearly 46
percent are aged between 40 and 50, and women account for some 57
percent.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, the article said, the social security
system in the eastern areas is still far from being satisfactory,
and most provinces and cities in these areas are not yet able to
put all their laborers under the protection of social insurance.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, it said, governments in most areas in
east China have set up the minimum life guarantee system for the
laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
"In Shenzhen, the collection and distribution of the funds for
pension, medicare and industrial injury insurance are handled by
some special government institutions, and the city government has
set up a special committee to monitor the management of the fund,"
it noted.
</P>
<P>
It described social security guarantee as an "indispensable
cushion" and a "propeller" for the re-employment of laid-off
people.
</P>
<P>
"Only after a unified social security system that covers the
entire society has been built could we see the emergence of a
real, competitive and vigorous labor market," the article
concluded.

Since 1993, it said, the city government of Jinan, capital of
east China's Shandong Province, has provided support for over 40
enterprises from some 15 different sectors to set up 43 special
markets for the wholesale of various industrial products.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 percent of the employees in these markets are
laid-off workers, it added.
</P>
<P>
Also in Jinan, a neighborhood committee has assisted unemployed
people in the neighborhood with running small private businesses,
such as restaurants, laundries, barber and tailoring shops, and
roadside vending.
</P>
<P>
The article said that it has become a common practice in
provinces and municipalities in east China to solve the problem of
laid-off workers through fostering the local labor markets.
</P>
<P>
There are now over 400 job placement offices in Shanghai, while
a computerized information network has been established in all
employment offices run by the local labor administration, the
article said.
</P>
<P>
In Ningbo, a female laid-off worker opened a private employment
office named "Lucky Strike," which specialized in helping laid-off
workers find new jobs.
</P>
<P>
The labor market in Shenzhen, a booming special economic zone
in south China's Guangdong Province, has attached first priority
to the employment of people with major troubles, such as couples
in which both spouses are jobless, single parents and elderly
women.
</P>
<P>
"In the vast eastern areas, a network of open and competitive
labor markets and an effective mechanism of market management have
been gradually taking shape," said the article.
</P>
<P>
However, it conceded that there remains a clearly noticeable
conflict between supply and demand in east China's labor markets.

<P>
SEOUL, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Letters from the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) arrived in Seoul last Saturday
for the first time since the outbreak of the Korean War in June,

<HEADLINE> Anjouan Island Governor on Comoros Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Governor Colonel Cheikh Allaoui
on the Indian Ocean island of Anjouan announced he was resigning
on Sunday, according to a report quoting witnesses as saying from
Moroni today.
</P>
<P>
Allaoui was appointed governor last month by Mohammed Taki,
president of the Islamic republic of the Comoros, during
pro-secession demonstrations on Anjouan.
</P>
<P>
"I offer you my sincerest apologies and i submit to you my
resignation," Allaoui told a rally in his home town of Domoni, 30
km southeast of Anjouan's capital Mutsamudu on Sunday, said the
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
He had backed Anjouan independence but defected to the
government in July after a meeting with Taki.
</P>
<P>
People at the rally responded with thunderous applause.
</P>
<P>
Under the Comoran constitution the governor is the highest
political authority on the island.
</P>
<P>
On Moheli island, which like Anjouan declared independence
from the Comoros Federation in August, pro-secessionists have
given governor Hachim Mohammed until today to submit his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
The secessionist-appointed Premier of Moheli, Soidri Ahmed,
said if he refused to resign he would be forced out.
</P>
<P>
Islanders on Anjouan and Moheli say they want to return to
French rule or become independent because they have received
little from the government except poverty and numerous coups
since independence from France in 1975.
</P>
<P>
The poverty in the Comoros, with a population of some 670,000,
paled in comparison with the prosperity on the island of Mayotte,
which voted against independence in 1975 and has remained under
French rule since.
</P>
<P>
However, France has denounced the secessionist unrest, saying
it could destabilize the whole region of Indian Ocean islands.

<HEADLINE> Toyota To Invest 740 Million US dollars In Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Leading Japanese car maker
Toyota unveiled a plan today to spend up to 740 million U.S.
dollars in Australia through 2005 and set up a research and
development plant in Australia.
</P>
<P>
Toyota Australia President Osamu Komori said part of the
company's spending would be a 74 million U.S. dollars upgrade of
Altona plant in south-west of Melbourne to accommodate production
of a new six-cylinder car from the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Toyota said the new car would be a V6 vehicle modeled on the
company's Avalon vehicle in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The upgrade will increase the plant's capacity to possibly
140,000 cars per year compared to 80,000 vehicles at the moment.
</P>
<P>
Toyota also predicted that by 2000 its exports from Australia
would be twice the 244 million U.S. dollar worth of vehicles the
car-maker currently shipped.
</P>
<P>
The investment plan was hailed by Australian Prime Minister
John Howard as "extremely good news for investment and jobs in
Australia."
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from car producers in Australia, including
Toyota, the prime minister made a decision two months ago to
freeze tariffs on imported cars at 15 percent until 2005,
rejecting proposals for further tariff cuts before 2005.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the government was told privately
prior to the decision on tariffs that the higher rate of
protection would "influence" future investment decisions by Toyota
and the other multinational car manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Speaking today at a joint press conference with Toyota
officials, the prime minister described Toyota's decision as "a
vindication of a decision by my government two months ago for the
long-term future of the motor industry in Australia".

ROME, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Italian basketball player Davide
Ancilotto collapsed during a tournament match and was rushed to
hospital here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ancilotto remained unconscious for 90 minutes. Initial tests
showed no brain damage but a medical bulletin on Sunday said: "The
patient is in a coma, and remains in a serious condition."
</P>
<P>
Doctors at Rome's San Filippo Neri hospital on Monday had
wanted to carry out a more extensive detailed brain scan using
magnetic resonance technology -- but the player's condition was
judged too perilous.
</P>
<P>
Hospital sources quoted by ANSA news agency said the player's
chances of survival were now slim and that the hours ahead on
Monday would be decisive.
</P>
<P>
Doctors were speculating that Ancilotti may have suffered a
brain haemorrhage or a loss of blood supply to the brain during
the match, which was played between Telemarket and French side
Nancy at Gubbio, near Perugia in central Italy.

<HEADLINE> Successful Macro-Control A Prelude for Further Development (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Editor's note: To welcome the
15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Xinhua
News Agency will from today on issue a series of articles on
China's reform and development based on interviews with
ministers. The following is the first story in the sequence.
</P>
<P>
China's macro-economic control drive in the past four years is
responsible for the country's swift economic growth in tandem with
effectively curbed inflation, and has laid a solid foundation for
economic and social trans-century development, said Chinese State
Planning Minister Chen Jinhua.
</P>
<P>
"The success of the macro-economic control drive is a good
indication that the Chinese government has learned a great deal
about the law of the socialist market economy, and increased its
ability to control a macro-economy and deal with economic
difficulties," Chen said in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
China started its macro-economic control effort in June, 1993,
in face of an overheated economy and double-digit inflation. But
the retail price index was brought down to 1.8 percent for the
first half of this year, while the economy kept growing at 9.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
Both domestic and overseas experience has shown that sharp
reductions in inflation usually result in an ever-changing and
volatile economy, said Chen.
</P>
<P>
The crowning success of the macro-economic control drive was
that China realized effective inflation control accompanied by a
moderately fast growth in economy, the minister added.

<HEADLINE> Successful Macro-Control A Prelude for Further Development (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chen attributed the accomplishment to well-chosen macro-control
policies, a greater variety of macro-control means, as well as
proper timing and flexibility of the policies.
</P>
<P>
As for demand, the Chinese government has imposed strict
measures to check the fixed-asset investment scale through a
moderately tight fiscal and money policy.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the growth in fixed-asset investment slowed down
to 12 percent during the January-June period from the 58.6 percent
in 1992, and the money supply also decreased gradually.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the central government also sought to increase
supply by attaching greater importance to the agriculture,
infrastructure facilities and basic industries, which led to a
progressive balance of supply and demand in the national economy.
</P>
<P>
The nation twice lifted purchasing price for grains in the past
four years and increased funding for agriculture, thereby boosting
the farmers' interest in farming, which in turn resulted in bumper
crops. Ultimately, the price hike in farm and non-staple products
which was once a leading contributor to the runaway inflation rate
was effectively restrained.
</P>
<P>
The shortage of some major production materials was turned
around, since top priority also went to industries in energy,
transportation, and raw materials.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jinhua pointed out that a salient feature of the
macro-control drive is that market-oriented economic leverages of
price, tax, credit, interest rate, and exchange rate played a
major role, instead of administrative and legal means.
</P>
<P>
"Our macro-control policies were drafted in line with the law
of value, and we also adopted both market-oriented and
administrative means to allocate the social resources. This is an
important reason behind the success of the macro-control drive,"
Chen stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Chinese government also made minor adjustments to the
macro-economic control policies over the past four years, based on
analysis and prediction of the national economy, while adhering to
a moderately tight fiscal and monetary policy, Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
To manage the high demand for capital, China raised the
interest rates of bank borrowings and lendings, and the relending
rate of the central bank on four occasions.
</P>
<P>
And when the inflation pressure eased, the government
authorized two rounds of cuts in the interest rates of bank
deposits and loans to lighten the loan burden on the businesses
and boost their production.
</P>
<P>
Chen also pointed out that the success of macro-economic
control is inseparable from the deepening of the economic reform.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, China successfully reformed its fiscal and tax
systems, system of finance, foreign exchange, investment and
circulation, which led to a more workable implementation of the
macro-control policies and offered solutions for deep-rooted
problems in the national economy, explained the minister.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jinhua said he believed that the macro-economic control
drive in the past four years has been a successful practice under
the socialist market economy and will provide "invaluable
experience" for putting the Chinese economy on a sound development
course.
</P>
<P>
He also pledged that reform would be deepened in the
state-owned enterprises and the economic structure would be
further adjusted to guarantee the healthy development of the
overall economy.

<HEADLINE> Israel Decides to Partially Release Frozen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 18 (Xinhua) -- In a major step toward
breaking the ice in the Israeli-Palestinian ties, Israel decided
today to release 30 percent of tax revenues frozen following the
recent terror bombings in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the move
following consultations with Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
and Foreign Minister David Levy.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the July 30's twin suicide bombings in
Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market which killed 16 people and
wounded 170 others, Israel immediately retaliated by imposing
sanctions on the Palestinians, including a total closure and
freezing the transfer of 14 million dollars in tax revenues it
collected from Palestinians on the behalf of the Palestinian
National Authority.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's spokesman Shai Bazak said that Israel's step to
release part of the tax money was "a return for some steps" taken
by the PNA for its cooperation in investigating the Mahane Yehuda
Bombing and Palestinian police's quick action in apprehending
three Palestinians who killed an Israeli taxi driver last week.
</P>
<P>
He added that Israel still demanded the PNA take tougher
actions to crack down on militant organizations and their
infrastructure, promising Israel would continue easing the
sanctions if its demand was met.
</P>
<P>
Israel's move also came following a series of high-level
meetings between the two sides on discussing ways to resume full
cooperation in combating terrorism and rebuild the lost
confidence.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday night, Netanyahu's attorney Yitzhak Molcho met
secretly with PNA leader Yasser Arafat in Gaza to express thank to
him for the Palestinian police's quick action in arresting the
three murderers in Jericho. Arafat reportedly demanded Israel
lift the closure and transfer the tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli and Palestinian security heads held a new
round of meeting in the Palestinian city Ramallah to discuss
future security cooperation and the Israeli sanctions. The
meeting was attended by officials from the United States Central
Intelligence Agency station in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
The tripartite security meeting was a result of the four-day
shuttle mission here early last week by U.S. peace envoy Dennis
Ross.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Israeli security officials asked to examine
the explosives found in a bomb factory in Beit Sahur, near
Jerusalem, which was run by the militant Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas), who claimed responsibility for the Jerusalem
bombings.
</P>
<P>
Israel's easing of the sanctions will further pave the way for
a pending visit to the region by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, who conditions her first Middle East tour on progress in
Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Brolin to Be Fined for Complain of Manager </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Swedish international striker
Tomas Brolin is to be fined for his recent complain of Leeds'
manager George Graham, local press reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"After telling me I could save my career at Leeds and make a go
of it this season, all they've done is try to kick me out," the
Swede was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Swede star has been the backup team in Leeds United since
he was transferred from the Italian club Parma 21 months ago. But
the forward attributed his lack of repressed performance in Leeds
to Graham.
</P>
<P>
"The club said that I'd have the same opportunity to keep a
place in the side as any other player in the squad. But that was
rubbish. I was frozen out and dumped in the reserves."
</P>
<P>
"If George has a problem with me he could at least say
something to my face," Brolin was quoted as saying. "Instead, he
has given me the silent treatment and any news about my future has
come second or third hand. I'm not just hurt and angry, I'm
confused."
</P>
<P>
Both Graham and Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale said the matter
would be dealt within the club which means a possible fine of the
player, who meanwhile is sure not to play in the starting team.

</P>
<P>
Weather forecasters have predicted that typhoon "Number 11," or

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Weaker In A Narrow Range </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar today
ended weaker against the U.S. dollar after spending much of the
session trading in a narrow range, also sidelined by action in the
local stock market.
</P>
<P>
The currency ended at 74.26 U.S. cents, down from 74.34
previously.
</P>
<P>
"There is no real enthusiasm out there, but there is some short
term buying," said Rothschild Australia senior foreign exchange
trader Paul Macarounas.
</P>
<P>
A few participants think the Reserve Bank of Australia could
cut official interest rates again before year-end. Tomorrow the
Reserve Bank will release its August bulletin that will contain
its quarterly report on the economy and financial markets.
</P>
<P>
"No doubt the bulletin is likely to maintain the upbeat tenor
on the inflation outlook already alluded to in the governors'
speech," Hambros economist Su-Lin Ong said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended at 87.00 from 87.95 late Friday
against yen and it was at 1.3458 down from 1.3707 against mark.

<HEADLINE> IFP Leader Demands Returning Documents Taken by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Inkatha Freedom Party
(IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi has vowed to force Walter
Felgate to return documents he had taken before defecting to the
ruling African National Congress last week.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi, leader of the biggest black opposition party in
South Africa, made the remarks against the backdrop of Felgate's
disclosure that he was writing a book on politics, dealing with
the period 1974 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
Felgate, a former right-hand man to Buthelezi and his speech
writer for years, defected to ANC on August 14, accusing Inkatha
of lacking democracy within its structure.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Felgate's defection, Buthelezi told a press
conference at the weekend that Felgate had acted illegally by
taking the documents.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi said the documents included minutes of the former
Kwazulu provincial cabinet and memorandums he had exchanged with
Felgate.
</P>
<P>
The documents had been accumulated over 17 years when Felgate
was employed by the former Kwazulu government as a research
officer, he said, adding that Felgate had signed a contract with
the government that the documents would not be published without
his authority.
</P>
<P>
However, Felgate denied Buthelezi's allegation, stressing
Buthelezi could do nothing about the fact he had the documents,
which, he said, were mainly speeches of Buthelezi and the IFP
leader had copies of them.
</P>
<P>
Felgate noted that he had also given the Kwazulu provincial
government copies of everything he had written for it.
</P>
<P>
He said the documents would provide background material for a
book on politics he had started writing, covering the period 1974
to 1994.

<HEADLINE> French Firm to Run Nigerian Refinery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- French oil firm Total has signed
with the Nigerian government a contract valued at 160 to 220
million U.S. Dollars for repairing a major Nigerian refinery and
managing it for three years.
</P>
<P>
"This Day" reported today that the contract is part of an
agreement between Total and the Nigeria National Petroleum
Corporation to revitalize Nigeria's refinery industry.
</P>
<P>
Being a major world oil producer, however, Nigeria has been
suffering constant fuel shortage in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
Of its four refineries, only the new Port Harcourt refinery
and the Warri refineries are still functioning with limited
capacities. The old Port Harcourt was destroyed by a fire in
1980s.
</P>
<P>
The Kaduna refinery and Petro-Chemical company was built in
the 1980s with a capacity of processing 110,000 barrels of crude
oil a day. It is responsible for supplying fuel to the northern
part of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The refinery, however, was shut down about a month ago due to
unit failure, as poor management and the lack of money to conduct
the periodical turn around maintenance have been forcing it to
operate on a shaky base.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government took over the responsibilities of
refining and distributing from foreign oil firms about three
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
Its past suggestions of contracting foreign firms to manage
the refineries or leasing the refineries to them have been
rejected, as foreign firms feared the enabling environment for
such deal does not exist.

<HEADLINE> Famine Looms in S. Leone As Food Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone has topped the list
of nations where a food crisis looms, beating drought-prone
Ethiopia, Somalia and Sudan, according to the Food and
Agricultural Organization (FAO).
</P>
<P>
The food situation in Sierra Leone is deteriorating rapidly
and could develop into famine if the current widespread
insecurity persists, the Daily Times reported today, quoting an
FAO official.
</P>
<P>
The security situation started to worsen since coupists
overthrew the civilian government led by ousted President Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah on May 25.
</P>
<P>
International aid workers have been evacuated and
rehabilitation projects have been put on hold, while up to 20,000
people have fled to neighboring countries, mostly Guinea and
Gambia, said Mwita Rukandema of United Nations organization.
</P>
<P>
According to FAO, "the food supply situation is tightening in
the main towns. The price of rice has tripled in the capital
Freetown and the supply of food and water is deteriorating. An
acute food shortage is also reported and severely affects all
economic activities."
</P>
<P>
Only one-fifth of the shops and markets have reopened since
the May 25 coup. Limited food distribution to vulnerable people
in Freetown, Bo in the south, Kenema in the southeast and Makeni
in the North are underway for about 26,000 people, a FAO report
said.
</P>
<P>
This worsening food supply situation, according to observers,
is expected to be intensified with the reinforcement of sanctions
and blockade by west African countries in a bid to force the
coupists to step down.

COLOMBO, August 18 (Xinhua) -- An army bomb disposal squad
Sunday defused a hand grenade and a bomb which were found hidden
in an abandoned well near Anurdhapura city in North-Central
Province of Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
According to police sources here today, the hand grenade and
the bomb were discovered by workers when they cleaned the well.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary investigation ruled out any Tamil rebel
involvement, but the sources said that the explosives may be
dumped in the well by an errant soldier or policemen, who
originally have wanted to sell them to the underworld or for some
personal purpose, but later got cold feet and feared to be
discovered, the sources added.

HONG KONG, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Museum of
Medical Science, a facility dedicated to the medical history of
the city, received a one-million-HK-dollar (128,000 US dollars)
donation, local newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
The presentation of the check was witnessed Sunday by some 50
youngsters who visited the Edwardian-style building in Mid-Levels.
</P>
<P>
The visit was part of a series of heritage-related activities
organized by the Home Affairs Department in support of the current
Heritage Year and the Summer Youth Program.
</P>
<P>
The museum's Chairman Dr. Gerald Choa said the museum was the
first such facility dedicated to exploring the interface between
traditional Chinese and Western medicine.
</P>
<P>
The building, which used to be occupied by the old Pathological
Institute, served both as an educational venue and a secure
location for the preservation of medical artifacts of historical
value, Choa said.
</P>
<P>
The new donation, contributed by the Lord Wilson Heritage
Trust, the Hang Seng Bank and several philanthropists, will help
maintain exhibition rooms, a lecture hall and other facilities of
the museum.

<HEADLINE> 10 Dies in Nigerian Community Conflicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 18 (Xinhua) -- No fewer than 10 persons were
feared dead and about 100 injured in violent clashes between two
communities in southwest Nigeria's Osun state at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Local media said the event began with a peaceful demonstration
on Friday by about 5,000 Modakeke youths, in protest of
relocating the Ife-east local government headquarters from
Modakeke to Oke-Ogbo in Ile-Ife.
</P>
<P>
The denouncement of the Ife leader by Modakeke youths
reportedly caused anger of the Ife people. When more students
joined both sides on Saturday, the fighting escalated from
throwing stones at each other to exchanging gunfires and burning
down houses.
</P>
<P>
The clashes continued from Saturday night into Sunday morning.
Dane guns, matchets, axes and broken bottles were used by both
sides. About 25 houses and many vehicles and other properties
were sprayed with inflammable materials and set on fire.
</P>
<P>
The clashes reportedly paralyzed all motor movement in and out
of the state and kept all residents in the area in their houses.
</P>
<P>
As at mid-Sunday, anti-riot police have been deployed to the
area and the situation has begun to calm down, while the state
government has announced a curfew from 6:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Plans to Participate in New Commonwealth Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is considering
participating in a 200 million US dollars fund to be launched by
the Commonwealth to provide assistance to South Asian nations like
India and Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The request for Malaysia's participation was made by
Commonwealth Secretary-General Chief Emeka Anyaoku when he met
Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim here
today, Malaysian Finance Secretary Hadenan Abdul Jalil said.
</P>
<P>
Hadenan told reporters after the hour-long meeting that
Malaysia's Employees Provident Fund (EPF) might contribute to the
fund.
</P>
<P>
The EPF had previously contributed 10 million US dollars to
another Commonwealth Fund set up to provide assistance to African
nations, he said.
</P>
<P>
The official said so far the Commonwealth itself had pledged to
contribute 50 million US dollars to the South Asia fund through
the Commonwealth Development Corporation, while Singapore and
India have agreed to provide 30 million US dollars each.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia's decision on whether to contribute to the
fund through the EPF would depend on the returns and viability.
</P>
<P>
Hadenan said that at today's meeting, Anyaoku also requested
Malaysia to consider contributing to several Commonwealth
initiatives such as the Center of Islamic Studies in Oxford and a
rain forest research project in Guyana.
</P>
<P>
He said Anyaoku also briefed Anwar on next month's Commonwealth
Finance Ministers meeting in Mauritius where Anwar is expected to
attend and speak on the regional economy.
</P>
<P>
Anyaoku is on a five-day visit here as part of a tour of
Commonwealth nations to brief leaders of member countries on the
preparation for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting
(CHOGM) in Edinburgh in October.

opposition party, Nambaryn Enkhayar, was elected into the Great
Hural, or parliament, preliminary results showed today.
</P>
<P>
Enkhbayar, chairman of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary

in the country's western Zavkhan province, to fill the seat left
vacant after Natsagyn Bagabandy was elected state president in May.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian PM Dispels Notion of Overheating Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime minister
Mahathir Mohamed said today his country has to be developed faster
to give the people every chance to enjoy a higher standard of
living and to catch up with developed nations.
</P>
<P>
Brushing aside foreign criticism that the country was
developing too fast and that the economy was overheating, Mahathir
said Malaysia was left behind during the colonial period.
</P>
<P>
"We have to move fast and run faster. If we were to run slower,
we will never catch up and the gap would be even greater and
forever, we will be left behind," he was quoted by the Malaysian
national news agency Bernama as saying when officiating at the
ground breaking for the Miri City Fan and Cultural Center in
Sarawak, East Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
"It is not over-heating, it is well-planned development," he
said, adding development projects were being carried out
throughout the nation with tower cranes easily seen everywhere
including in Sabah and Sarawak.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said his government was not interested in building
monuments but in development that could improve the living
standards of the people.
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to work hard to enrich the country for the
better life of the people," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The West have good cities developed over hundreds of years but
when we are doing that, they said we are developing too fast, too
ambitious, living beyond our capacity and no money to provide fund
for this. Why do these people criticize us when we only want to
give our people a good life?" he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said Sarawak state had underwent tremendous
development over the last 15 years, more people now owned cars and
all major towns are connected by roads.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Intergovernmental Negotiating
Committee for the Convention to Combat Desertification (CCD)
begins a five-day session, the 10th of the kind, here today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting aims at finalizing arrangements for the first
ministerial Conference of the Parties (COP) of the CCD scheduled
for September 29 through October 10 in Rome, said a press release
by the CCD interim secretariat currently based in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
The COP conference is expected to choose the site of the
convention's permanent secretariat among the three cities -- Bonn,
Montreal and Murcia.
</P>
<P>
The Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee will consider a
number of issues this week, including the identity of the

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen To Obtain Water From Dongjiang River Reservoir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Completion of a Dongjiang
River reservoir will relieve water shortages in Shenzhen,
Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
An expert panel from the Ministry of Water Resources and the
Chinese Academy of Sciences recently approved a plan for a water
diversion pipeline linking the Xinfengjiang Reservoir with
Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
The south China city has suffered from a severe water shortage
resulting from rapid economic and social development in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
The city recorded a 30 percent increase in total demand for
water during the first six months, with the water demand in Hong
Kong growing by 0.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
A research report released by the Social Economic Research
Center under the Guangdong Provincial Government predicts that
Shenzhen's demand for water, both private and industrial, will hit
1.4 billion cu.m. daily by the year 2000. The actual water supply
capacity of 970 million cu.m. will fall 430 million cu.m. short of
demand.
</P>
<P>
In July of 1996, the Water Resources Bureau of Guangdong
Province approved Shenzhen's plan to divert 350 million cu.m. of
water annually from the Dongjiang River Valley which flows north
of the city.
</P>
<P>
Heyuan City introduced a proposal indicating that the most
efficient method for supply water to the city would be to
construct a pipeline linking it to the Xinfengjiang Reservoir.
</P>
<P>
Several water resources institutes, and institutes for
prospecting, survey and design from the ministries of water
resources and power industry have been invited to inspect into the
actual sites and produce feasibility studies.
</P>
<P>
Experts on the appraisal panel say that the water diversion
pipeline will offer an effective way to provide eastern areas of
Shenzhen with high quality water and to alleviate shortages of
water resources facing the city by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
They estimate the annual water diversion volume of 350 million
cu.m. from Xinfengjiang Reservoir will only account for 5.7
percent of the reservoir's total water storage volume and will
have little impact on the facility's ability to combat flooding
and to generate power. The also say the project will have no
impact on the water supply, navigation, irrigation and environment
in the lower reaches of the Dongjiang River.

<HEADLINE> 200 Pilots, Engineers Leave Iran for Better Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Some 200 pilots and flight
engineers have left Iran for better jobs and higher pay since the
1979 Islamic revolution due to grim economic prospects at home,
the Persian daily Salam reported today.
</P>
<P>
It said that in the past year alone, some 50 pilots and flight
engineers have emigrated to such countries as Malaysia, South
Korea, Japan and Luxembourg where they have found higher-pay
jobs.
</P>
<P>
"The highest pay rate for an Iranian pilot is 1.5 million
rials (500 U.S. dollars) per month whereas the same pilot would
receive 5,000 dollars in Malaysia," an Iranian pilot told the
daily.
</P>
<P>
Another pilot complained about the obsolescence of the planes
used in Iran, which he said worries Iranian pilots.
</P>
<P>
"In addition to receiving low wages, Iranian pilots have to
fly old planes whereas in other countries such as Malaysia, they
fly new planes which are safer," he added.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted another pilot as saying that he objected to
the body search of the Iranian pilots at the Iranian airports.
</P>
<P>
He said that before boarding the plane, the pilots have to go
through body search which is insulting for the pilots.

<HEADLINE> Hainan Economy Grows 7.2 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Hainan, an island province in
south China, registered a gross domestic product of 17.9 billion
yuan in the first half of this year, up 7.2 percent from the 1996
period.
</P>
<P>
The province registered an overall increase in output for
grain, sugar, fruit and vegetables in the first half of the year,
with grain production reaching 1.15 million tons and vegetable
output hitting 1.64 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The industrial sector ended the period with 2.25 billion yuan
in added value, up 15.4 percent from the corresponding 1996
period. In addition, the province's investments in fixed assets
have grown by over 40 percent annually in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Hainan hosted over 2.43 million tourists during the period, a
rise of 18.2 percent and a record high for the past eight
years. Foreign exchange earnings from tourism reached 50.76
million US dollars, representing 27.8 percent growth on the
previous year's period.
</P>
<P>
The economic resurgence followed two years of steady economic
growth. Hainan's 1996 GDP of 39.8 billion yuan represented a
six-fold jump on 1987. In 1988, Hainan became a province.
</P>
<P>
Hainan's service sector attracted the lion's share of
investments and witnessed rapid development between 1991-1992,
while the industrial and agricultural sectors continued to lag
behind.
</P>
<P>
The new round of economic reform introduced in 1993 has helped
the province restructure its development infrastructure and follow
a healthy track of economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Orders to Ensure Safety of Life at Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today lamented the loss of lives in the two sea tragedies that hit
the country within 24 hours last Friday, leaving at least 19
people dead and a number of others missing.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony held here to mark the 2nd National
Seafarers' Day, Ramos ordered the entire marine industry and the
departments of transportation and communications and national
defense to take joint efforts to ensure the safety of life at sea.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the two sea mishaps underlined the need "to stop,
prevent and punish the neglect and greed that lead to the
unnecessary loss of lives, property and goodwill arising out of
such maritime calamities."
</P>
<P>
Also today, a police officer from Manila's Western Police
District Homicide Division told Xinhua that homicide charges have
been filed against the owner, the captain and two operators of the
tourist boat which capsized late last Friday in Manila Bay.
</P>
<P>
The sightseeing boat overturned off the bay and just in front
of the Philippine Navy Headquarters reportedly because of strong
winds and high waves, killing seven Hong Kong tourists.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary investigation showed that the boat, with a
permitted capacity of only about 23 people, was badly overloaded.
The small wooden boat sank with a total of 49 people on board.
</P>
<P>
In another sea tragedy, an inter-island passenger ship carrying
137 people sank before dawn last Friday in Biliran province in the
central Philippines, initially killing 12 people. As of this
morning, a Coast Guard officer said, none of the 16 missing
passengers were spotted.
</P>
<P>
Transportation and Communications Secretary Arnuto Enrile said
Sunday he would convene a maritime consultative conference among
all government agencies, including the police and military, to
draw up a comprehensive action plan designed to prevent maritime
accidents.
</P>
<P>
Ramos earlier ordered Enrile to undertake a thorough
investigation into the two sea tragedies and punish those
violators of the country's safety of life at sea law.

<P>
KAMPALA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- A group of the Allied
Democratic Forces (ADF) rebels have abducted 39 seminarists in
western Uganda, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
The rebels raided St. John's Evangelist minor seminar in
Bukonzo County, Kasese district last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Two seminarists have been seriously injured when they tried to
escape and were admitted to a local hospital later.
</P>

report and said Uganda army in the district was pursuing the
rebels who retreated into the mountains of Kyondo.
</P>
<P>
Twenty of the abducted escaped later, but 19 were still
missing by last night, the report said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Israeli Economic Growth Down to 1.6 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli economy grew by
an annual 1.6 percent in the second quarter this year, according
to a report published today by the Central Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
During the January-July period, the economy grew by an annual
2 percent, thus continuing a clear slowdown trend which began in
late 1995, when semi-annual growth was still at 6 percent, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs said that
the number of job seekers in July rose by 1.1 percent to
145,600. Over 55 percent of July's job-seekers were newly
unemployed, a roughly 12 percent increase since the beginning of
the year. In all, 16,815 new job seekers have been registered
this year.
</P>
<P>
However, some of that rise was attributable to the steady
arrival of new immigrants, most of them are initially
jobless. Even so, current unemployment level, 7.7 percent of the
work force, is a three-year high.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the number of joblessness is rapidly
expanding in the periphery's development towns. The number of
cities with 10 percent or higher unemployment rates rose last
month to 17, compared with eight in April.
</P>
<P>
Though the discouraging data might give reason to contemplate
an easing of the Bank of Israel's monetary policy, an
interest-rate cut now seems less likely, considering the central
bank's report released Sunday that money supply rose 5.4 percent
last month.
</P>
<P>
The increase in money supply was attributed primarily to the
relatively sharp, 1.2 percent interest-rate cut which came in
tandem with the expansion of the shekel's fluctuation bands in
June.
</P>
<P>
In all, money supply has risen by 13 percent so far this
year. Set against this backdrop, it is unlikely that central bank
governor Jacob Frenkel will cut interest rates for September, and
in fact he may decide to raise them in order to help the
government meet its own annual inflation target of 7 to 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
The slow-down in Israel's economic growth is largely due to
the Likud government's belt-tightening policy aimed at cutting
the inflation and budgetary deficit.
</P>
<P>
Since coming to power in June last year, the government has
cut 8 billion shekels (2.3 billion U.S. dollars) from the 1997
budget, and the annual economic growth in 1997 slowed down
consequently to about 4 percent, compared with an average of 6
percent in the past years.
</P>
<P>
On August 13, the cabinet approved the 1998 budget by cutting
2.3 billion shekels (657 million dollars) in public expenditures
and setting 1998's annual target rate of inflation at 7 to 10
percent.

<HEADLINE> Middlemen Found to Be High Newsprint Cost Root in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The proliferation of middlemen
and lack of a reliable pulp and paper mill are responsible for the
high cost of newsprint in Zambia, a printing managing director
has said.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia today quoted John Mpundu, managing director of
job printing agencies as saying Sunday in northern Zambia that
prices of imported newsprint will continue to rise unless local
sources are found.
</P>
<P>
He complained that there are too many middlemen dealing
newsprint and other printing accessories resulting in high
prices.
</P>
<P>
Big printing firms such as those owned by leading local
newspaper companies are making little or no profit because much
of the money is spent on procuring newsprint, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Unless Zambia sets up its pulp and paper mill plant, middlemen
will continue to make a rip off," Mpundu warned.
</P>
<P>
The middlemen are charging twice as much as the normal cost of
imported newsprint.
</P>
<P>
Reasonable prices for a ton of newsprint are pegged at between
800 U.S. Dollars and 1,000 Dollars, but the middlemen sell a ton
at the price of more than 1,500 Dollars.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Military Plays Down Turkey-Iran Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish military has
expressed pessimism over a positive change in the souring
Turkey-Iran relations despite the election of a moderate president
in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Local newspaper Daily News today quoted senior military
sources, who declined to be named, as saying that President
Mohammad Khatami's coming to power must not bring about a warmer
era between Ankara and Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing Khatami, who took office August 4, as a moderate
politician, the sources said he would meet challenges from Islamic
hardliners although he intended to conduct liberal reform in a
country ruled by Shariah, or Islamic law.
</P>
<P>
"It is certain that he will face severe difficulties, which
will also affect Turkey, from the country's dominant religious
structure headed by the powerful spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei," the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that despite Khatami himself's moderate
tendency, Iran's internal and external policies would be finally
determined by the powerful religious structure instead of the
government.
</P>
<P>
Under Iran's current political system, the president is
subordinate to the spiritual leader, who appeared reluctant to to
show his support for Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, who advocates more rights and freedom for women, is
considered as a hopeful figure to relatively bridge the deep gap
between the Islamic state and the Western world, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The spiritual leader, however, has the final say on Iran's
political, military and social policies, which is believed to be a
key block to the new president's future reforms, they added.
</P>
<P>
The Military sources voiced that Turkish-Iranian relations
could not be improved unless Tehran made a significant change in
its policy toward the secular Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government has not given up its traditional cards
against Turkey, such as backing the outlawed Kurdish Workers'
Party (PKK) rebels and encouraging fundamentalist movement in
Turkey, the sources claimed.
</P>
<P>
In February, Turkey expelled several Iranian diplomats,
including its ambassador to Ankara, because of their "improper
speeches made at a religious rally held by Turkey's extremist
Islamists," touching off a war of words between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Turkish military, which is firmly opposed to the previous
pro-Islamic government's efforts to develop closer ties with
Tehran, always voiced their concern over alleged Iran's attempt to
intervene in Turkey's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkish military's increasingly frequent cooperation
with the Israeli army and its cross-border campaign against the
PKK in northern Iraq have come under sharp criticism from
Iran.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines will continue to stay away from the foreign exchange
market this week and traders expect the peso will further
depreciate to between 30 to 31 pesos against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports today quoted Central Bank Managing Director
Amando Tetangco as saying that the combined effects of strong
demand for dollars from importers and the pressure exerted by
declining Southern Asian currencies are pushing the peso down.
</P>
<P>
He said that the central bank has decided to stop propping up
the currency, which depreciated to around 29.76 pesos to the
dollar last week.
</P>
<P>
"Why would you intervene? We will let the market determine the
level of the exchange rate," he said, ruling out the possibility
of increasing the bank's overnight rates to arrest the
depreciation of the peso.
</P>
<P>
Traders here said that the market will test the 30 pesos-one
dollar level this week.
</P>
<P>
The central bank will likely keep its overnight rates at 14
percent since it does not want to choke off economic growth with
high interest rates, they said.
</P>
<P>
The bank raised its overnight borrowing rate to 32 percent last
month to combat speculations, but slashed it gradually to 14
percent by last week.
</P>
<P>
Traders said that if the central bank keeps interest rates
high, there is going to be a recession.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Senator Witnesses Remarkable Changes in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Mexican senator Gustavo Caravajal
Moreno said that he has witnessed a happy population in Tibet,
which is keeping pace with the modern times.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark after recently completing a tour of the
Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Senator Moreno, who also serves as vice-president of the
Inter-Parliamentary Union, visited Tibet between Aug. 8-12. He
arrived in the region from Japan and was bound for various African
countries to discuss candidates for the next president of the
union.
</P>
<P>
Moreno noted the great changes which have taken place since his
first visit to Tibet's capital of Lhasa in 1973. He particularly
noted the broad streets, bustling business, modern facilities and
luxury hotels along the highway from the Gonggar Airport to
Lhasa. Moreno pointed to the totally different environment
compared to his visit 24 years ago, and noted that Tibet has bid
farewell to serfdom and entered modern society.
</P>
<P>
The senator learned that some 300,000 students attend Tibet's
over 4,000 schools, and that more than 10,000 Tibetan students are
studying in Tibetan schools or related classes in over 20
provinces and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
He also learned that the central government has invested more
than 40 billion yuan (4.8 billion US dollars) in improving the
region's infrastructure, with some 3.6 billion yuan spent in 62
infrastructure projects over the past four years alone.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Tibet's economy has grown by over ten percent
annually in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Moreno said the Chinese government has done its utmost to
ensure the rights of Tibetan people, including the right to an
education.
</P>
<P>
The senator was deeply impressed by the preferential policies
the central government provides for Tibet. For example, Tibetan
farmers, herdsmen and township enterprises are exempt from income
tax, and the central government subsidizes the budgets of local
governments.
</P>
<P>
Moreno said he has never believed distorted reports and unjust
comments made by some media organizations in the West.
</P>
<P>
"They are totally unaware of how Tibetan people live," said
Moreno.
</P>
<P>
The senator said the happy smiles on the faces of Tibetans
served as a true indication of their happy lives. He also
reiterated his belief that the Chinese government will continue to
help Tibet achieve faster and sounder development.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the regional autonomy of Tibet and the relationship
between the local and central governments, he stressed that the
international community must acknowledge the fact that most
Tibetan people support unification.
</P>
<P>
Moreno also noted that had the opportunity to a Tibetan dinner
prepared by the former chef for the late 10th Panchen Lama.

<HEADLINE> Triad Security Talks Begin in West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
security officials met last night under the eye of
U.S. officials to discuss security cooperation between the two
sides, the state-run Israeli Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting in the West Bank town of Ramallah was held within a
trangular framework laid down by U.S. special envoy Dennis Ross
during his four-day mediation mission here last week.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Israeli officials expressed interest in
examining the explosives found in a bomb factory of the Islamic
militant group Hamas which was raided by Palestinian police
recently.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side asked Israel to drop the series of
measures it has taken strangling Palestinian economic life after
the Jerusalem market bombing on July 30, which killed 16 people
and wounded 170 more.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis said during the meeting that they were satisfied
with the cooperation of Palestinian security forces in the
investigation of the market bombing. Both sides agreed to meet
again later this week.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Cabinet secretary Danny Navey said after the meeting
that the economic sanctions imposed on Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) since the market bombing may be eased following
increased security cooperation between Israel and Palestine.
</P>
<P>
He said Palestinian security officials have provided Israel
with results of the lab tests carried out on explosives founded in
the Hamas bomb factory.
</P>
<P>
But he added that releasing funds to Palestine does not mean
Israel is convenced that PNA Chairmen Yasser Arafat is doing all
he can to dismantle terrorist organizations.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been withholding, since the suicide bombings, some
70 million U.S. dollars in tax and customs revenues it collected
from Palestinians and due the PNA in accordance with their
agreements.

<HEADLINE> Food Eats Into Arab Budgets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Arabs spend up to half their
income on food while most of their needs for farming products are
met from abroad because of poor domestic production, an Arab food
official said.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview in the latest edition of the business
weekly Al Iqtesadi, Falah Jabr, head of the Arab Food Industries
Union, said Arab citizens allocate between 25 and 50 percent of
their income to foodstuffs each year.
</P>
<P>
"Arab food imports are estimated at 35 billion dollars a
year. We are importing nearly 10 percent of the world's total
food trade," Jabr said.
</P>
<P>
Arabs also import nearly 20 percent of the world's wheat
supplies, 15 percent of the cereals, and 60 percent of the
livestock, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jabr estimated total investment by the 22-member Arab League
in the farming sector at around 50 billion dollars a year, but
said production was growing by only 2 percent a year while
consumption was rising by 6-7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Modern Use of Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The fan, an indispensable article
to drive away summer heat by Chinese people for centuries, seems
to have been vanished as electric fans and air conditioners
have entered into more Chinese families.
</P>
<P>
But this year, fans have become easy-to-sell goods in Hangzhou,
capital city of east China's Zhejiang province, after years of
seclusion.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that over 1,0000 fans, made of paper,
silk, bamboo, straw and feather, were sold per day in some of the
city's famous fan shops like Tiangong Yiyuan and Wang Xingji
during the last two months.
</P>
<P>
The Fan Festival organized by some fan shops always attract a
great number of people. To promote sales, some shops have even
invited renowned writers to inscribe poems on fans for customers.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that 99 percent of households in Hangzhou,
known as an "oven" in China, have bought electric fans or air
conditioners. Then why has there been a fan-purchase craze?
</P>
<P>
"With the living standards improved, people try to make their
life colorful. It has become a fashion nowadays to use fans as a
decoration or gists to friends and relatives," said a manager of
Wang Xingji Factory, the oldest fan manufacturer in China.
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, hundreds of people come to buy fans for wall
decoration in a single day. We have to adapt our production for
the varied needs," he added.
</P>
<P>
The 100-year old factory, which used to focus on producing
black paper folding fans, has developed over 400 kinds of fans
this year to meet customers' different needs. There is a rich
variety in the materials of the fans' covering, including paper,
feather, silk, bamboo, grass, bone and leaf, making fans more
appealing to fan lovers.
</P>
<P>
A young couple, who had bought a two-meter-wide silk fan from
the Tiangong Yiyuan Shop, said they would use the fan to decorate
the parlor of their new apartment.
</P>
<P>
"It's quite elegant and distinctive to use a fan as
decoration," the husband said.
</P>
<P>
Fans have been used in people's daily life more widely than
ever before. In the morning, senior people played Yangko (a folk
dance) on the bank of the West Lake, the best-known scenic spot in
Hangzhou, with silk fans in their hands, forming a unique
scenery. Young ladies with pocket sandalwood fans look more
graceful.
</P>
<P>
At present, an ordinary paper fan with painting or poems from
famous painters or calligraphers can be a gift of fine taste to a
friend or a business partner, and the exquisitely made precious
sandalwood fans are rated as popular goods for collectors these
days.
</P>
<P>
The earlist fan makers might never imagine that one day fans
would be treasured in the elegant boxes or put up high on the
wall.

BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Some 1,036 artists from Chinese
inland areas and Taiwan, or 107 more artists than in 1996,
participated in 108 cultural exchanges during the first half of
this year.
</P>
<P>
According to a Ministry of Culture official, "The two sides
abide by the principles of mutual respect, sincerity, practicality
and people-to-people relations when developing cultural exchanges."
</P>
<P>
The inland areas offer Taiwan outstanding cultural programs
featuring Chinese traditional culture and national characteristics.
</P>
<P>
A lantern display from north China's Shanxi Province and the
Quanzhou Puppet Show Troupe from Fujian Province attracted more
than two million people during a tour of Taiwan over this year's
traditional Chinese Lunar New Year Festival.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a combined group of performers, including members

URUMQI, August 18 (Xinhua) -- While many parts of the world are

in China with a work force of 2.3 million.
</P>
<P>
The corp, which has led the country in land reclamation and
desert control in recent years, has invested 1.29 billion yuan in
reclaiming 126,000 ha of barren land and improving 171,600 ha of
low-yield field.
</P>
<P>
Comprehensive agricultural development has helped to transform
Xinjiang's vast wilderness ares into forests and arable land. As a

<HEADLINE> Top Queen's Counsels in Singapore for "Historic Legal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Two Queen's Counsels with what
is said "formidable reputations" are in action in a 12-day court
case starting here today between 11 ruling People's Action Party
(PAP) leaders and opposition Workers' Party chief J.B. Jeyaretnam,
the Straits Times reported.
</P>
<P>
It said Thomas Shields, Queen's Counsel, will open the case in
the High Court with a submission on behalf of his client, Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong, who will take the stand after the opening
act in a case which has attracted international attention.
</P>
<P>
At least two observers from international human rights groups,
the Amnesty International and the International Commission of
Jurists, are here to monitor the hearing, described by the Times
of London newspaper as a "historic legal confrontation", the
Straits Times said.
</P>
<P>
After taking questions from Shields, Prime Minister Goh will be
cross-examined by George Carman, the Queen's Counsel hired by
Jeyaretnam to fight eight defamation suits.
</P>
<P>
The PAP leaders, including Prime Minister Goh and Senior
Minister Lee Kuan Yew, are suing Jeyaretnam for telling a Workers'
Party election campaign rally on January 1 this year that his
team-mate in the Cheng San Group Representation Constituency,
lawyer Tang Liang Hong, had just placed before him two reports the
latter made to the police against the Prime Minister and his team.
</P>
<P>
The PAP leaders claimed the words Jeyaretnam used implied that
they had conspired to commit criminal defamation against Tang by
labeling him an anti-Christian, anti-English educated Chinese
chauvinist.
</P>
<P>
The Times of London quoted Jeyaretnam as saying last Wednesday
that Lee was out to make him a bankrupt and force him to give up
his Non-Constituency MP seat in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Lee and other PAP leaders are also expected to take the stand
before Justice S. Rajendran over the next 12 days, the Straits
Times report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Straits Times, Shields specializes in libel
work and was involved in several important cases, while Carman is
among the top libel lawyers in London.

exports and remittances.
</P>
<P>
A central bank announcement said that Bangladesh Bank's buying
and selling rates of U.S. dollar from and to authorized dealer
banks would be 44.45 taka and 44.65 taka respectively.
</P>
<P>
This is the second devaluation during the current 1997-98
fiscal year. The last downward adjustment of the taka was made on
July 20.
</P>
<P>
The latest currency devaluation is also the ninth by the Awami
(people's) League government which took power on June 23 last
year. The total amount of depreciation is 2.80 taka during the
present government.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh Bank said the refixation had been effected with a
view to maintaining the incentives for remittances from Bangladesh
nationals working abroad and also the competitiveness of exports.
</P>
<P>
According to central bank sources, the foreign exchange reserve
now stood at 1.65 billion dollars which is not so comfortable, and
the country would have to make a payment in the Asian Clearing
Union next month which would shed some 120 million dollars from
the reserve.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the foreign exchange reserve level will come down
further, making the reserve more uncomfortable.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Considers Delaying Big Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government is
considering delaying some of its major projects as part of tighter
monetary and fiscal policies designed to calm the panic in the
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
"There is a possibility that some major projects will be
delayed, especially projects that are not on the main priority
list," the local press today quoted Finance Minister Mar'ie
Muhammad as saying.
</P>
<P>
President Soeharto has instructed all related institutions to
reassess major projects, the minister said on Saturday after
Soeharto's state address at the parliament to mark Indonesia's
52nd independence anniversary.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto called on both government institutions and the private
sector to consolidate and make rational projections following the
fall of the rupiah.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's monetary authorities floated the rupiah last week.
The currency then plunged to as low as 2,960 rupiah against the
U.S. dollar on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The stock market has also been hit hard by the currency
turmoil. The Jakarta stock index fell sharply last week to close
at 617.71 points, the lowest level this year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that many Indonesian firms will be hard hit by
the fall of the rupiah as a large amount of their borrowings are
unhedged. They estimated that Indonesian corporations have at
least 10 percent of their total foreign debt unhedged.

<HEADLINE> Italy Warns Citizens Against Kenyan Seaside Spots Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 17 (Xinhua) -- The Italian Foreign Ministry has
advised Italian tourists to avoid traveling to Kenyan seaside
resorts of Mombasa and Malindi where repeated incidence of
violence broke out in recent days.
</P>
<P>
"Since last Thursday we have been advising all tourist
organizations against visits to Mombasa and traveling along the
road from Mombasa to Malindi," a Foreign Ministry official said
today.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 people have been reportedly killed in five days
when gangs armed with automatic rifles attacked villages around
Mombasa. But the only incidence affecting foreign tourists was a
raid on Saturday when several of them fled a guest house torched
by gangsters.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has tightened security checks and sent in
the armed forces. Tourism is Kenya's biggest source of jobs and
hard currency, generating hundreds of millions of dollars in
profit each year.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, the ministry also expressed concern about the
kidnapping of 13 Italian tourists in Yemen this summer who were
released now.

BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Some 1,036 artists from Chinese
inland areas and Taiwan, or 107 more artists than in 1996,
participated in 108 cultural exchanges during the first half of

The inland areas offer Taiwan outstanding cultural programs
featuring Chinese traditional culture and national characteristics.

<P>
SOFIA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- A landslide by the Black Sea in
northern Bulgaria killed one and injured two today, the Bulgarska
Telegrafna Agentsia reported.
</P>
<P>
The landslide occurred this noon near a beach called "the
Shepherd", somewhere between Albena and Belchik, burying people
in sand and mud.
</P>
<P>
A baby less than three years old was evacuated together with
his parents from the mud, but died halfway to the hospital. No
more people were found beneath the mud.
</P>
<P>
The landslide is over 10-meter long, 20 to 25-meter wide and
3-meter high. The collapsed area being small, the Bulgarian Navy
had to launch the rescue work from the sea.
</P>
<P>
Today's landslide is seen by experts as a continuation of Black
Sea seashore landslides in the north of the country, which started
at the beginning of this year and destroyed tens of villas and
some roads.

ROME, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Mountain rescue teams said they
have found two more bodies of climbing victims in the northern
Alpine region, the ANSA news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 people have died there in climbing accidents this

struck by lightening during a violent thunderstorm Saturday
afternoon.
</P>

who had spent the whole night stuck on a rock face near the
2,800-meter-high Roda di Vael peak still roped to Binelli.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Enterprises of Shandong's Heze Prepare for Shareholding Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- All state-owned and collective
companies in Heze City, east China's Shandong Province, will be
transformed into shareholding firms within this year.
</P>
<P>
"China Daily" today quoted Mayor Yang Yongcheng as saying that
the Heze City government decided to provide full financial support
to large firms vital to local economic growth, but leave smaller
ones to be regulated by market forces.
</P>
<P>
The "partnership shareholding" will be more popular here in
Heze, well-known for growing peony flowers in China, contrasting
standard shareholding in the wester economic concept.
</P>
<P>
The special shareholding stipulates that shares be held by
employees only. Hence, it is also known as "international
shareholding". The system, initiated in rural areas in early
1980s, is aimed at solving capital shortage in small companies.
</P>
<P>
Most of China's enterprises are small in scale. The government
believes "partnership shareholding" will increase employees' work
enthusiasm and raise more money. Therefore, The State Commission
for Economic Restructuring issued a formal guideline on August 7
to spread the practice nationwide.
</P>
<P>
According to Mayor Yang, Heze, with a population of 1.2
million, will also list one of its money-making firms on
domestic bourses this year.

<HEADLINE> Authorities Warn Inadequate Road Repair Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- China's transport authorities
are taking a close look at the inferior level of maintenance of
the country's fast-growing highway network, today's China Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Communications has ordered practical measures
to be taken by localities to better road maintenance and
management to improve the condition of the highway transport
network throughout China and increase its efficiency, the English
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
After an unprecedented highway construction boom in the past
decade, the total length of roads in the country now exceeds 1.18
million kilometers, and road travel has accounted for 88.7 percent
of the country's passenger transport volume and 91 percent of its
cargo transport.
</P>
<P>
However, road maintenance has been seriously neglected, as the
appetite for new road construction in localities has hampered the
healthy development of highways, the Daily quoted an official of
the ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
Every year 25,000 kilometers of new roads are added to the
network and these all require maintenance.
</P>
<P>
Traffic on half of the national highways has exceeded the
designed handling capacity.
</P>
<P>
Many of the highways are of low standard and susceptible to
natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 kilometers of the national and provincial
highways have extended their designated service life and need to
be renovated.
</P>
<P>
However, the limited funds from road maintenance raised from
each vehicle can scarcely make ends meet, the official noted.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the country's technological level in road repairs
is low and most of the repair work has been done by hand,
hindering efficiency.

<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Stock Exchange
recorded slow trading and falling prices last week.
</P>
<P>
The Composite Stock Index fell 5.2 percent from the previous
week to 1,143.06 last week, with a weekly turnover of 19.537
billion yuan, roughly matching last week's figure. The blue chip
SSE-30 stock index dropped 6.3 percent to close at 3,579.9.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the market inertia to the disclosure of
worse than expected interim reports of some listed companies.
</P>
<P>
The declining economic efficiency of blue chip stocks such as
Lujiazui dampened investors' confidence and led to sharply falling
prices.

</P>
<P>
The Australian
</P>
<P>
-- The Australian government will be warned it risks being cast
as "petty criminal" in world free-trade circles over its plans for
a more active industry policy and its export assistance programs
could be challenged by the European Union. The government is
about to receive bureaucratic advice that some of the policies
urged by two recent industry policy reports could contravene world
trade rules and undermine Australia's free-trade credentials if
implemented.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- The heads of Australia's eight wealthiest universities will
launch a campaign in the Asia-Pacific to lift the standing of the
country's higher education system and counter "adverse publicity"
generated by anti-Asian immigrant politician Pauline Hanson and
others.
</P>
<P>
The Age
</P>
<P>
-- Australian share prices are expected to fall sharply today
after Wall Street's 3 percent plunge at the weekend -- its biggest
decline in nearly six years.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>
-- The year 2000 "millennium bug" is beginning to take its toll
on Australian corporate budgets, with the Commonwealth Bank of
Australia revealing that the cost of converting its computer
systems to fix the problem could exceed 100 million Australian
dollars (74 million U.S. dollars).

<P>
VIENNA, August 17 (Xinhua) -- British rider Carl Fogarty
enjoyed victory and tasted defeat in one competition at the World
Superbike Championships on Sunday, winning his first race and then
colliding in his second to relinquish his short-lived overall lead.
</P>
<P>
The Ducati rider topped the podium after the first of two races
at the A1-Ring. He was 0.297 seconds ahead of Japan's Akiro
Yanagawa on a Kawasaki and 0.615 clear of New Zealand's Aaron
Slight on a Honda.
</P>
<P>
In the first race five riders were within a second of each
other nearing the line until Fogarty broke away and won in 38
minutes 11.804 seconds after 25 laps.
</P>
<P>
But in the second, Fogarty caused a crash with his fiercest
rival, Honda rider John Kocinski, when he tried to overtake the
American.
</P>
<P>
Kocinski had just taken the lead from Fogarty when both men
slid off-track. The Briton was forced to abandon but Kocinski was
able to remount his bike and continue.
</P>
<P>
The American recovered sensationally to finish third and regain
the overall lead in the standings with 273 points to Fogarty's 267
points and Slight's 223.
</P>
<P>
The crash between the sport's two leading men allowed Yanagawa
to become the first Japanese rider to win a superbike world
championship race outside his home country.
</P>
<P>
Yanagawa crossed the finish line 0.121 seconds ahead of Slight
and 7.264 ahead of Kocinski.

<HEADLINE> Residents Eager for Drug Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 18 (Xinhua) -- Facing an ever-increasing threat
from narcotics, most Beijingers urge the government to strengthen
education on drug-prevention.
</P>
<P>
Over half the capital city's residents are concerned about
media reporting of anti-drug efforts, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
These are just two of the results of a sample survey on
drug-related issues which was revealed yesterday by the National
Narcotics-Control Committee, China's highest anti-drug authority.
</P>
<P>
Other questions put to respondents included: Are they aware of
drug use? Who are the major drug-users? How do they become
drug-addicts? Who is concerned about drug addicts? How serious and
harmful has the drug problem become in Beijing? The public's
comments were also invited on the government's efforts against
drugs.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted using a sample of 1,200 families with
members aged between 12 and 60 in Beijing's eight urban
districts.
</P>
<P>
Over 90 percent of those surveyed agreed that drugs will be
a major menace to morality and the Chinese nation if effective
measures are not taken against them.
</P>
<P>
Respondents hoped that heavy punishments would be given to
those involved in drug-related crimes and that government efforts
against drugs would be further intensified.

WASHINGTON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov
of Russia collected his second title in three months by
outpowering Patrick Rafter of Australian 7-6 (7/4), 6-4 in the

WASHINGTON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Ninth seed Jonas Bjorkman of
Sweden won the 915,000 U.S. dollars RCA Championships by defeating
fifth seed Carlos Moya of Spain 2-0 in the final at Indianapolis,
the United States on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Bjorkman beat Moya 6-3, 7-6 (7-3) to win the 150,000 U.S.
dollars top prize. He broke Moya three times during the one-hour,
31-minute match.
</P>
<P>
This was the 25-year-old Bjorkman's second ATP Tour title this
year.
</P>
<P>
With the victory, the Swedish player has improved to 45-18 this
season. That moves him into second place in match wins this
season behind Michael Chang's 47.
</P>
<P>
Bjorkman also prevailed at the Bellsouth Open in Auckland in
January and was a finalist at Coral Springs in May. He will break
into the top 20 in next week's ATP Tour rankings for the first
time in his career.
</P>
<P>
This was also Bjorkman's first victory in three meetings with
Moya, including a five-set loss to the Spaniard in the fourth
round of this year's Australian Open.
</P>
<P>
For Moya, it was the fourth ATP Tour final of the year, but he
has lost all the four. He has been a finalist at Sydney and the
Australian Open on the hard surface, and Amsterdam two weeks ago
on clay.
</P>
<P>
Moya was seeking his third career ATP Tour title after winning
at Buenos Aires in 1995 and Umag, Croatia last year.

LONDON, August 17 (Xinhua) -- Mick Doohan claimed his fourth
successive 500cc world championship title when he won the British
Grand Prix in Donington, England on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a two-bike duel with his Honda teammate Tedayuki Okada, the
32-year-old Australian, who only needed to finish in the top seven
to assure himself of the world championship, was determined to win.
</P>
<P>
Doohan, who has been riding bikes since the age of 10 and who
walks with a limp after a race fall in 1992, took the chequered
flag with 0.231 seconds to spare ahead of the dogged Okada.
</P>
<P>
The win gave Doohan his third consecutive British Grand Prix
and put him alongside Mike Hailwood and Giacomo Agostini as the
only riders in 500cc history to win four straight world titles.
</P>
<P>
Another record the man from Brisbane is hoping to achieve is
the number of race wins in one season.

SARAJEVO, August 17 (Xinhua)--Troops of the NATO-led
Stabilization Force (SFOR) on Sunday were deployed around the
headquarters of the public security center in Banja Luka to
prevent possible clashes between police factions in the Serb
territory.
</P>
<P>
A short statement by SFOR said the move was required by the
Office of the High Representative, the highest international
civilian authority in Bosnia, after the police headquarters were
taken over earlier in the day by special police loyal to
Republika Srpska President Biljana Plavsic.
</P>
<P>
Other sources said that the special police raided the
headquarters which had been controlled by the Pale-based
interior ministry and found bugging devices suspected of being
used to spy Plavsic by her opponents.
</P>
<P>
Over the past seven weeks, Plavsic and other RS government
leaders have been locked in an ever-deepening political crisis
over her decision to dismiss the interior minister and dissolve
