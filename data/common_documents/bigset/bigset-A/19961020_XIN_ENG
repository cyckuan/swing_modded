HARARE, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Minister of Health
and Child Welfare, Timothy Stamps, today urged parents in the
country to educate their children on AIDS, a move he said could
enable them to avoid infection of the killer disease.
</P>
<P>
"We have to be frank with our children because an ignorant
child is a vulnerable child," said Stamps.
</P>
<P>
The health minister admitted it is unusual for old people to
talk to children about sex, "but frankness in dealing with any
challenge is very important."
</P>
<P>
In Zimbabwe, which ranks second to Botswana in the number of
AIDS cases which had been compiled by the World Health
Organisation, between 300 and 500 people are dying of AIDS every

<HEADLINE> UN Special Envoy for Angola Visits S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Visiting United Nations
Special Envoy for Angola, Alioune Blondin Beye, today met with
South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, urging South Africa
to help push forward the peace process in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki pledged support of the South African government which he
said would provide financial aid and other backing for the
Angolan peace process.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was Beye's fifth in four days with African leaders
including President El Hadja Bongo of Gabon, President Robert
Mugabe of Zimbabwe, President Fred Chiluba of Zambia and
President Sam Nujoma of Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Beye said the ceasefire in war-torn Angola is moving forward
but the road to peace is strewn with obstacles, adding that the
conflict between the government and the former rebel movement,
the National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) is
far from being solved.
</P>
<P>
"The situation of the ceasefire is on course. We are seeking
peace throughout the country. You will remember that it was not
too long ago that 1000 people were dying each day," said the UN
envoy.
</P>
<P>
According to the Lusaka peace protocol, signed by the Angolan
government and the UNITA in 1994, the UN has maintained a third
observers mission, the United Nations Angola Verification Mission
(UNAVEM III), to secure the peace process in the war-torn
country.
</P>
<P>
UNAVEM III is the UN's largest peacekeeping operation in
Africa with a contingent of 7260 soldiers, 238 police officers,
607 civilians and 68 UN volunteers.
</P>
<P>
However, Beye said the U.N. was disappointed that UNITA had
not fully fulfilled the Lusaka Peace Agreement signed in 1994.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Observatory
issued a tropical cyclone warning and hoisted the No.1 signal this
evening, updating the warning.
</P>
<P>
A summary of severe tropical storm Beth issued 11:45 P.M. by
the Observatory said that, after crossing Luzon, Typhoon Beth
entered the South China Sea on Friday.
</P>
<P>
As Beth moved steadily westwards, it edged closer to Hong Kong
on Saturday morning and the standby signal No.1 was hoisted at
11:45 A.M.
</P>
<P>
But Beth later weakened into a severe tropical storm in the
afternoon, the Observatory said.
</P>
<P>
At 11:00 p.m., the center of Beth was estimated to be about 490
kilometers southeast of Hong Kong and is forecast to move west at
about 15 kilometers per hour across the northern part of the South
China sea in the general direction of Xisha, the Observatory said.
</P>
<P>
The circulation of Beth is relatively small and Hong Kong is
unlikely to come under its direct influence, it said.
</P>
<P>
However, under the combined effect of Beth and the northeast
monsoon over southern China, local winds are strengthening. Over
offshore waters, winds are now occasionally strong and sea
conditions will also become rough.
</P>
<P>
Strong winds are expected to affect Hong Kong for most of
Sunday and the weather will be cloudy with patches of rain, the
Observatory forecasted.

<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, October 19 (Xinhua) -- An Arab member of the Israeli
Knesset (Parliament) has called for putting pressure on the
Israeli government to complete the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Wahab el Darawsha, who is also Chairman of the Arab
Democratic Party in Israel, made the remarks in an exclusive
interview published in Tunisian newspaper Ashorouq today.
</P>
<P>
"Such pressure should be exerted by Arab states, without
awaiting any pressure from the U.S., because the U.S. is
absolutely prejudiced in favor of Israel," Darawsha explained.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question about the Palestinian-Israeli dispute over
Jerusalem, Darawsha said: "There would be no peace without
Jerusalem, because this city is in the blood of Moslems and the
people of Palestine."
</P>
<P>
"Palestinian demands in connection with Jerusalem are plain. No
concessions can be made about the fact that East Jerusalem is the
capital of Palestine," he said. "East Jerusalem is still retaining
its Islamic characteristics. Many Israelis insist that Jerusalem
be a unified capital for them, which would never lead to
tranquility in the region," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the role played by his party in the Knesset to restore Arab
rights and the occupied Palestinian territories, Darawsha
said: "We are always seeking to convince Israeli officials and
public opinion of the legitimate Arab rights. We always call for
admitting the rights of the Palestinian people, including their
right to have an independent state."
</P>
<P>
Asked about his position on the Netanyahu government's
rejection of the establishment of an independent Palestinian
state, Darawsha said: "There is an obvious Israeli rejection of
the establishment of such a state. This rejection is not in the
interest of peace."
</P>
<P>
"Netanyahu has to reconsider his attitude towards the Arab and
Palestinians if he is willing to succeed and live in peace," he
concluded.

to bar young people from drinking and driving will lose a
percentage of their federal highway aid.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Clinton said he was directing the White House
drug policy chief, retired Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey, and
Transportation Secretary Federico Pena to develop within 90 days a
plan requiring that young people be tested for drugs as a
condition of obtaining driver's licenses.
</P>
<P>
In a memo to McCaffrey and Pena, Clinton said he believed that
the lure of a driver's license was so compelling for most young
people that it could be used to effect their behavior.
</P>
<P>
He announced that the Transportation Department would issue a
regulation Monday implementing a law passed by Congress that
requires all states to make "zero tolerance" for alcohol a
required standard for youthful drivers.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,200 young people died in alcohol-related car
crashes last year.

Jacques Chirac this evening.

<P>
The talks covered future of the peace process in the region,

</P>
<P>
Chirac arrived here this afternoon for a three-day official
visit to Syria at the start of a Mideast tour. Al-Assad welcomed

<P>
Syria pays great attention to the role played by France in the
Middle East.

<HEADLINE> Tourist Activity Between Egypt, Israel to Decrease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 19 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian tourism official said
today that the tourist activity between Israel and Egypt will decrease
in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
This is due to the current political tension in the region and
Israeli intransigence on the peace process, Chairman of the
Tourist Promotion Authority Adel Abdel Aziz was quoted
by the Egyptian Middle East News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
He urged tourist agencies to step up their marketing campaigns
and change the tour itinerary so that it begins with Egypt and
ends with Israel and not vice versa, as is the case now.
</P>
<P>
The agencies will present to the November Cairo economy
conference a file for complete information on tourist investment
in the country, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has the highest rate of tourist duration of stay as
tourists spend an average of 6.7 nights here, while elsewhere in
the world, the average is four nights, Abdel Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
Recent tension in the Middle East has not affected Egypt's
tourist activity or income from the industry, as tourists, who
chose Egypt as their destination, are only concerned with what
happens inside the country, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hinting that tourism and peace are "two sides of a coin" and
inseparable, he said that Egyptian-Israeli tourist cooperation
hinges on the realization of progress in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral cooperation will be postponed until a
comprehensive and just peace is established in the region and
Israel changes its policies, he said.

HANGZHOU, October 20 (Xinhua) -- China's largest city Shanghai
and Ningbo, the well-developed port city of Zhejiang Province, are
carrying out a joint effort to help the drought-hit Zhoushan
Archipelago of Zhejiang.
</P>

<P>
The municipal government of Shanghai has taken measures to
encourage local ships to transport water everyday to Zhoushan by
reducing or exempting levies on the vessels involved in the action.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of tons of water is being delivered from both
Shanghai and Ningbo to the islands everyday. Thanks to joint
efforts by the two cities, as well help from local residents, the

<HEADLINE> HK Toys Fair Bigger, More Varied: Organizers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The 23rd Hong Kong Toys and
Games Fair, the biggest exhibition of its kind in Asia, is set to
become ever bigger and more varied next year with the introduction
of new pavilions and more floor space, organizers said here today.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (TDC), the
fair will be held from January 14 to 17, 1997 at the Hong Kong
Convention and Exhibition Center. It will occupy six floors
covering an area of 24,000 square meters.
</P>
<P>
"Next year's Toys and Games Fair is set to attract not only a
greater number of exhibitors but will likely draw a record number
of decision-making visitors from Hong Kong and overseas," said
TDC's Exhibition Manager Perry Fung.
</P>
<P>
And a baby product pavilion is to be added for the first time.
</P>
<P>
"By offering a wider variety of quality products, we ensure
this fair will continue to be the best showcase for manufacturers
of toys and games and nobody in the industry can afford to miss
it," Fung said.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 overseas exhibitors took total orders valued at a
record 3,100 million HK dollars (401 million US dollars) during
this year's four-day Fair in January.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has been the world's leading toys exporter for years.
Hong Kong's total exports grew 12 percent to exceed 77.7 billion
HK dollars (10 billion US dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
Among the wide range of toys products, Hong Kong is
particularly strong in producing plastic, electronic toys and
games, remote controlled and battery operated toys.

<HEADLINE> Hekmatyar's Top Commanders Join Dostum in Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 20 (Xinhua) -- A key commander of former
Afghan Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar today joined hands with
northern Afghan warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum, reports from
Afghanistan said today.
</P>
<P>
Commander Zardat announced in Mazar-i-Sharif, headquarters of
Dostum in the north, that he had switched to Dostum because of
political differences with Hekmatyar.
</P>
<P>
Zardat had controlled the key strategic town of Sarobi about 70
kilometers east of Kabul until the Taliban militia overran it on
their way to taking Kabul in September.
</P>
<P>
Zardat said he now has "no relationship" with the ousted prime
minister and leader of Hezb-i-Islami faction, and that three other
key commanders have also left the now-diminished faction.
</P>
<P>
"Myself, Commander Assam Khan Kharakhel, Commander Chamand and
Commander Khalam are all now loyal to Dostum," he was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Dostum controls seven provinces in northern Afghanistan but the
ethnic Uzbek general has remained in contact with the Taliban
while other factions have taken up arms against the student
militia.
</P>
<P>
Zardat also said that he was prepared to retake his stronghold
of Sarobi, which was captured by the Taliban militia after a brief
battle.
</P>
<P>
"I have over 15,000 soldiers in the area who are armed and
ready to fight the Taliban if Dostum orders it," Zardat said.
</P>
<P>
Zardat's switching along with other Hezb commanders seriously
weakened the position of Hekmatyar and may signal the end of
Hekmatyar's political future, as he has virtually no troops and no
power, said Afghan analysts.

HAIKOU, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Nine people were killed in south
China's island province of Hainan when a bus ran into the back of a
heavy freight wagon on an expressway. Another five people were
injured in the accident on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The traffic accident was the second worst in less than three
months on the East Haiyu Expressway, which links Haikou and Sanya,
the province's two largest cities in the north and south.
</P>
<P>
On August 16, an accident involving a bus left nine people dead
and another 27 injured, in addition to a direct economic loss of
700,000 yuan (about 84,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The local police blame traffic rule violations, and a lack
of barrier blocks and safety marks for the high level of
road accidents.

<HEADLINE> Hashimoto, Other Party Leaders Heading Toward Reelection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 20 (Xinhua) -- President of the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP) Ryutaro Hashimoto and other political party
leaders appeared to be winning reelection in today's House of
Representatives polls, according to early returns.
</P>
<P>
The returns assured Hashimoto, also prime minister of a
three-way coalition government, of comfortably winning his seat in
his home district in Okayama in western Japan.
</P>
<P>
Ichiro Ozawa, leader of the main opposition Shinshinto (the New
Frontier Party), was also the likely winner in his constituency.
</P>
<P>
Yukio Hatohama and Health and Welfare Minister Naoto Kan,
co-leaders of the newly created Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ),
looked to be victorious in Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost main
island and Tokyo's 18th district respectively, the returns showed.
</P>
<P>
Takako Doi, leader of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), minor
partner in the coalition, was assured of winning reelection in her
newly drawn No. 7 constituency in Hyogo Prefecture, western Japan.
</P>
<P>
Tetsuzo Fuwa, presidium chairman of the Japanese Communist Party
(JCP), will likely keep his seat in the lower house of the Diet
(parliament) with a victory in the Tokyo proportional
representation bloc.
</P>
<P>
The vote counting as of 22:30 local time (13:30 GMT) showed
that the LDP, the dominant force in the coalition government,
gained 210 seats, followed by Shinshinto with 126 and DPJ with 37,
according to NHK, Japan's public television.
</P>
<P>
Initial results are expected around midnight and the final ones
will likely to be declared early Monday, election officials said.

<HEADLINE> Sociologists Encourage Development of Charities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- China should give energetic
support to the development of charities in a bid to promote
socialist ethical and cultural progress, and social and economic
development, according to a group of sociologists.
</P>
<P>
Cui Naifu, president of China Charity Federation, made a speech
today at a forum in Beijing, "Socialist Ethical and Cultural
Progress, Morality and Charities".
</P>
<P>
He said that as an important supplementary means for the
country's social welfare system, charities play an important role,
not only in maintaining social stability, but also in promoting
the country's socialist ethical and cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
The two-day forum is being attended by over twenty experts in
philosophy, literature, sociology, economics, as well as
politics. Dozens of representatives from charitable organizations
in Shanghai, Tianjin and some other cities, are also taking part.
</P>
<P>
The topics of the forum include morality in today's China,
morality under a socialist market economy, and the position and
function of charities in building morality.
</P>
<P>
Famous writer Wang Meng, the country's former minister of
Culture, pointed out the economic gap between China's coastal
areas and inland provinces is likely to create a series of
problems, and it is difficult to entirely rely on the government
efforts to solve them.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that China's charities should involve more and
more ordinary citizens in a move to get more help from an
increasing number of people.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the China Charity Federation raised a
total of 546 million yuan of funds during the January-September
period this year, 405 million yuan of which so far has been
allocated to support the elderly people, children, and those in
need of help.

<HEADLINE> Secret of Chinese Herbal Medicines Decoded By Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Kobashi Kyoichi, an honorary
professor of Toyama Medical and Pharmaceutical University of
Japan, has decoded the mystery of Chinese herbal medicines.
</P>
<P>
He has revealed for the first time how they work in the human
body.
</P>
<P>
The professor's research was outlined at an international
symposium on natural medicine and pharmaceutical study,
held in Dalian City in China's northeastern Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
During two decades of research, the Japanese scholar discovered
that many elements in Chinese herbal drugs, such as sennoside,
become effective in treating diseases only with the help of
micro-viruses dwelling in the intestines of humans.
</P>
<P>
Through numerous experiments, he has proved that the
pharmaceutical elements of the herbs could not perform a role in
virusless intestines. This shows, from the other side, that the
herbal elements must work with the help of viruses.
</P>
<P>
The professor held that the digestive system of the human body
is a micro-ecological environment, which houses over 100 kinds of
viruses with their total number up to 100 trillions.
</P>
<P>
The human body will only be in a healthy status when the
viruses are ecologically balanced, while the medicinal elements of
Chinese herbal drugs, with the help of the viruses, are regulating
the balance of the human body's micro-ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
The academic achievement by Kobashi and his colleagues has
drawn great interest in international medical circles.
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese experts believe that the view of the Japanese
professor may be helpful in persuading westerners who are
reluctant to recognize that Chinese Medicine has a scientific
logic, since the mechanism of Chinese Medicine has never been
clearly explained.  enditem

<HEADLINE> Japan Expected to Re-form Coalition Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic Party is likely to re-form a
coalition government with other parties, because of a possible
failure to win clear majority in today's general election.
</P>
<P>
The LDP, due to a record low voter turnout estimated at 58
percent, could fall about 10 seats short of the 251 it needs to
end three years of coalition rule, according to local press.
</P>
<P>
Nippon Television (NTV) predicted that Hashimoto's party, which
called the election one month ago, will fall short of an outright
majority, with only some 237 seats.
</P>
<P>
In the outgoing parliament, the LDP had 211 seats in a 511-seat
Lower House and governed in a coalition government with the Social
Democrats and Sakigake, a LDP splinter group.
</P>
<P>
A record 1,503 candidates from nine parties participated in
today's vote for a 500-seat Lower House in a revised electoral
system. Under the new system, voters will elect 300 single-seat
candidates, while other 200 seats will be decided by proportional
representation.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition group Shinshinto (New Frontier Party), with
160 seats in the outgoing parliament, is forecast to maintain its
numbers.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party, set up only last month with 52 Lower
House defectors from the Social Democrats and Sakigake, is also
expected to maintain its seats.
</P>
<P>
The only clear winner among smaller parties appeared to be the
Japan Communist Party, which exit polls showed would likely
increase its seats to 25 from 15.
</P>
<P>
Today's election is the first general one since 1993 when the
LDP lost its 38-year sole grip on power, ushering in a period of
coalition rule.
</P>
<P>
The election is described as a "landmark" or "turning point"
because the four-year term for the Lower House signifies the new
government will lead the state into the next century.
</P>
<P>
It is held almost one year ahead of schedule because Hashimoto,
who became prime minister in January, believed that he could win
sole power for his party.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Calls for Educational Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
has called for greater efforts to be made to reform education in
China and to improve basic education.
</P>
<P>
Education, he said, should focus on improving the all-round
qualities of students, rather than having too many exams.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks during an inspection tour in Qinghai
Province of northwest China from October 17 to 19.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed that the farming and pastoral areas, and places
inhabited by the ethnic minorities, should take a practical and
realistic approach in running elementary education.
</P>
<P>
He urged farming and pastoral areas to combine agriculture and
animal husbandry with science and education, and train useful
personnel to help rural areas cast off poverty and become
prosperous.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China, and the State Council, attach great importance to
education.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier added that the key to reaching the targets, as
listed in the Ninth Five-Year Plan for National Economic and
Social Development and the Long-Range Objectives to the Year 2010,
is to improve the quality of the whole nation, implement the
principle of rejuvenating China by science and education, and
improve education, science and technology.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier also inspected a local non-staple food supply
project, termed the "shopping-basket project", which has been
officially implemented in China since 1989.
</P>
<P>
He said that hard efforts must be made to implement the project,
since it is related to the interests of all people.
</P>
<P>
Even greater efforts must be made to develop the project in
Qinghai, since the area is cold and high on the Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau, he added.

<HEADLINE> 28  Percent of Lebanese Families Live in Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 20 (Xinhua)-- Some 200,000 Lebanese families,
or 28 percent of the total, are living in poverty, a study
published in the weekend by the United Nations Development Program
(UNDP) and Lebanon's Council for Development and Reconstruction
said.
</P>
<P>
The study was published to mark the International Day for the
Eradication of Poverty in the world.
</P>
<P>
It explained that poverty meant deprivation of one or more of
the basic human needs, including food, drinking water, sanitary
systems, health care, housing, education and a clean environment.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty is not only measured by low income, but also by the
people's inability to have access to basic social and health
services," the study said.
</P>
<P>
In Lebanon, the study showed that the lowest poverty line in
urban areas, which only covers food expenses for a family of five
persons, was estimated at 400 dollars by the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the highest urban poverty line, which covers food,
clothing, housing, health and education expenses, was estimated at
800 dollars per month.
</P>
<P>
In the rural areas, the lowest poverty line was equivalent to
300 dollars a month and the highest to 500 dollars per month, the
study said.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, the number of poor families was put at 200,000, or
28 percent of the total, including 50,000, or 7.5 percent, living
in abject poverty.
</P>
<P>
The number of poor people was estimated at around 1 million,
including a quarter million living below the lowest poverty line,
the study added.
</P>
<P>
The majority of poor families live in the suburbs of the
capital and other major cities, where the minimum sanitary and
health requirements are lacking, and the majority of abject poor
families live in rural areas and constitute one quarter of the
rural population.
</P>
<P>
Effects of the 15-year civil war and initially inefficient
economic and social mechanism as well as bad infrastructure are
the main reasons for poverty in Lebanon, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
"The war led to the reduction of the Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) by 40 percent, and caused heavy damage to the infrastructure
and the means of production in addition to losses of human lives,"
the study said.
</P>
<P>
Rampant inflation was also one of the most destructive
aftermaths of the war.
</P>
<P>
"Reduction in the value of income, the growing gap between
income and expenses, in addition to unemployment and displacement,
deprived Lebanese families of their financial strength and
capacity to confront increasingly difficult living conditions,"
the study added.
</P>
<P>
It stressed the Lebanese government was trying to combat
poverty by improving economic performance and increasing
production, not merely raising salaries.
</P>
<P>
"The government is also seeking to reduce the cost of living by
stabilizing the value of the Lebanese currency and adopting a new
taxation system aimed at attracting investments," the study
underlined.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait to Give Top Priority to Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait would place
national security and cooperation with other Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) member states at the top of its government
priorities, Kuwaiti Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh Saad
Al-Abdullah Al-Sabah said today.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Kuwait will continue to attach great
importance to the defense treaties signed with its allies, the
prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
He was outlining his government's future policies in an
address dealing with a host of wide-ranging subjects that covered
the nation's domestic and foreign concerns at the inaugural
session of the eighth legislative term of the Kuwaiti parliament
attended by the Kuwaiti Amir and 50 MPs as well as the Cabinet
ministers.
</P>
<P>
Saad said, "National security, both internal and external,
will continue to head the government's priorities," adding that
his "government will never hesitate to implement the defense
treaties concluded with brotherly and friendly countries so as
to ensure effective support when necessary to our armed forces
in thwarting any threatening dangers."
</P>
<P>
"The government will continue to attach greatest importance
to the international dimension of the security of Kuwait through
security arrangements with friendly countries and due
coordination with all brotherly and friendly countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has signed defense cooperation agreements with the
United States, Britain and France since the 1991 Gulf War that
liberated Kuwait from seven months' Iraqi occupation.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Salem, who is considered to have a better
understanding of the security situation, particularly the
relations with the U.S., was selected as the new defense
minister in Kuwait's new cabinet. He is one of the four cabinet
ministers coming from the ruling Sabah family, and once held
ambassadorial posts in Washington and London.
</P>
<P>
On relations with the GCC states, the prime minister said
that his government would continue consolidating, deepening and
expanding positive and constructive cooperation in all fields
between Kuwait and other brotherly GCC countries, foremost Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
"We firmly believe that the security of all GCC countries is
indivisible and that the protection and safeguarding of such
security is a collective responsibility shouldered collectively
by all GCC members," he said.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Bahrain, Qatar and
the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
On the Middle East peace process, Sheikh Saad urged Israel to
honor international resolutions to bolster the peace process,
especially on the Syrian-Israeli and Lebanese-Israeli tracks in a
way that will ensure just, comprehensive and lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister again expressed Kuwait's concern about what
he described as threats from its neighboring Iraq, saying "the
continued moves and threats by the Iraqi regime still highlight
its determination to threaten the peace and security of our
entire region."
</P>
<P>
On the whole, he stressed the importance of the firm
principles of international relations that is to adhere to the
principles of international law, to respect the independence and
sovereignty of states and maintain relations of good
neighborliness.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said his government would continue to
work for the further strengthening of cooperation among Islamic
countries.
</P>
<P>
On other fields, he dealt with issues such as economic
development, health service, restructuring of population, housing
care, youth problem, and women's demands for political rights.
</P>
<P>
On economic development, he said that it should be coupled
with the reactivation of social development which requires the
adoption of a new philosophy.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait would also encourage the private initiatives to let
them join the Kuwaiti "government policies and measures intended
to diversify economic resources and avoid reliance on oil as the
sole source of income," he underscored.

<HEADLINE> Ekeus Holds Talks with Iraqi Deputy Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) charged with dismantling Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction, met here Saturday evening with Iraqi
Deputy Premier Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The INA said that the two sides discussed issues related to
the agreement of joint work signed by Iraq and the UNSCOM on
June 22 this year, when Ekeus paid a visit to Iraq which defused
a confrontation between arms inspectors and the Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
According to the joint statement signed between the two sides,
every two months Ekeus makes a tour of Baghdad to speed up the
UNSCOM mission here in cooperation with the Iraqi side.
</P>
<P>
The INA said that those who were present at Aziz's meeting
with Ekeus included Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf, Oil
Minister Amir Mohammed Rashid, Adviser at the Presidency Office
Amir al-Saadi, who is also director of the Military
Industrialization Organization, as well as a number of experts.
</P>
<P>
The official Iraqi News Agency did not go into any details
concerning the current talks between the two sides. In no way can
the chief U.N. inspector be reached for any information on his
discussion with Iraq which is believed to focus on Iraq's missile
area.
</P>
<P>
Ekeus, who arrived here Saturday, is expected to conclude his
current visit to Iraq Monday.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been suffering from more than six years of
U.N. sanctions since it invaded Kuwait in August 1990. It must
obtain from the UNSCOM a bill of clearance on its past weapons
program before the U.N. can consider lifting the
sanctions. However, Iraq insists that it has met all obligations
toward the relevant U.N. resolutions and demands a total lifting
of the sanctions the U.N. imposed on the country.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Parliament Holds First Session, New Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait's newly elected
eighth National Assembly held its first session today during
which the former speaker of the parliament Ahmad Al-Saadoun was
re-elected for another four-year term.
</P>
<P>
He won 30 votes against 29 for Jassem Al-Khorafi, the only
challenger for the speakership who lost by a single vote during
the session which was attended by 50 parliamentary members and
cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
According to Kuwait Constitution, cabinet members, both elected
to the parliament or directly appointed, are considered as
members in the house who enjoy full voting rights on various
issues except on a no-confidence motion against a cabinet member.
</P>
<P>
A total of 60 members, except the Crown Prince and Prime
Minister Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah who left
before the secret vote casting took place, were in
attendance. Fifty-nine members cast their votes with one
abstention.
</P>
<P>
Saadoun, an independent in the parliament, was born in 1932
and holds a degree in literature. He had worked as an Assistant
Undersecretary at the Ministry of Communications, Chairman of the
Kuwait Football Association as well as Deputy Head of the Asian
Union.
</P>
<P>
He held the post of Deputy Speaker of Parliament during the
1975 and 1981 parliaments.
</P>
<P>
The loser Khorafi is Kuwait's wealthiest businessman. He was
an MP in both 1981 and 1985 National Assembly. He claimed that the
voting results should be ineffective because, according to
Kuwait's constitution, the speaker must obtain a special majority
of half the total members plus one and not simply majority of
those in attendance. In this case, Saadoun should at least win 31
votes to hold the post, he said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the cabinet members, who constituted one sixth
of the votes, had played a very important role in choosing
whom to hold the post.
</P>
<P>
The government expected to have a smoother four years with the
new parliament compared with the last opposition-dominated house
which probed its every move. The voting result could have deep
effects on parliament's performance.
</P>
<P>
During the parliamentary session today, other leaders were also
elected. MP Talal Al-Ayyar won the post as Deputy Speaker of the
Assembly with 31 votes. Leaders of various parliamentary
committees were also elected. Kuwait has the only elected
parliament in the Gulf region and parliamentary democracy started
in the small oil-rich Gulf state in 1963 after it got independence.
</P>
<P>
The new house is made up of 50 elected MPs, four of
whom are also ministers, and 11 ministers including the Prime
Minister Sheikh Saad.
</P>
<P>
There are no political parties in Kuwait, about half of
the elected MPs are pro-government.

<HEADLINE> China's Re-Employment Project Shows Initial Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, October 20 (Xinhua) -- A national re-employment project
has helped find work for 2.43 million people in China in the
past year, officials have said.
</P>
<P>
A total of five million unemployed people have participated in
the project, which has been implemented in 200 cities throughout
China, the officials told a meeting on the project in Jinan.
</P>
<P>
The large population base and the rapid increase of labor
resources, especially the shift in the economic growth mode from
extensive to intensive, industrial restructuring, and enterprise
reforms, have combined to make China's state-owned enterprises
less able to create job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
A great increase in the number of farmers leaving rural
communities for urban areas has added to the employment problem,
the officials noted.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has pledged to create jobs for 40
million people during the current Ninth Five-Year Plan period
(1996-2000), and keep the urban unemployment rate at about four
percent.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that 23 Chinese provinces, autonomous
regions and municipalities have drawn up detailed plans to
implement the national re-employment project. The scheme focuses
on developing service industries and community services, promoting
the growth of small enterprises, and the non-state-owned economy,
and training laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Labor, Li Boyong, hailed the re-employment project,
saying it taps the positive role of the government, enterprises,
labourers, and all aspects of society.
</P>
<P>
"Through the re-employment project, we will look for new
employment channels in the situation of switching from a planned,
to a market economy," Li said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Golkar Chief on Ties with Chinese CP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's ruling party Golkar
hoped the visit of the representative of the Chinese Communist
Party (CCP) to the country will promote cooperation between the
two parties.
</P>
<P>
The expression was made by Harmoko, chairman of Indonesia's
functional groups (Golkar), when meeting with visiting Chinese
Communist Party's representative Li Shuzheng here today.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of visit between the representatives of the two
parties, especially between representatives of young generations
and women will become the bridge for pushing forward further
contacts between the two countries and their peoples, he said.
</P>
<P>
Harmoko said the next century will be the Asian century, so he
expressed the hope that the two parties should cooperate with each
other in seeking world peace, social justice and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Li Shuzheng, who arrived here on October 18 to attend the
activities to commemorate the 32nd anniversary of the founding of
the Golkar, said friendly cooperation between the two countries
has developed continuously since the restoration of diplomatic
relations between China and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
On relations between parties, she said the difference in social
systems and ideology should not become precondition for the
development of inter-party relations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Communist Party is willing to make friendly
contacts with the ruling parties of neighboring countries
including Golkar in Indonesia on the basis of independence, full
equality, mutual respect and non-interference in each other's
internal affairs, she said during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
She also said the contacts between the two parties will promote
bilateral cooperation, especially economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Li and representatives from some other countries also took part
in a grand reception held by Harmoko to mark the Golkar's 32nd
anniversary this evening.
</P>
<P>
Li is the first Chinese Communist Party's representative
visiting the country at the invitation of Harmoko.

<HEADLINE> China's Economy Enters Smooth, Proper Growth Period (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- China's once over-heated
economy has entered another period of smooth and orderly growth
after four years of macro-control.
</P>
<P>
Information from authoritative economic departments and
research institutes shows that the country's national economy is
seeing a bright development trend.
</P>
<P>
The goal of "soft-landing" could be basically achieved within
1996, with a new round of growth period beginning from the third
quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
Qiu Xiaohua, an economist and general-accountant at the State
Statistical Bureau, pointed out that the country's economy has
entered a period of smooth development, with inflation controlled
and the relationship between supply and demand improved at the
macro-level, a change from the past, when high economic growth
rate went hand in hand with high inflation.
</P>
<P>
He noted that this year's economic growth rate is expected to
be higher than price increases for the first time since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the year, China's macro-economy has
concentrated on four major points: strengthening agriculture;
deepening reform of state-owned enterprises; improving and
intensifying macro economic control; and further opening to the
outside world to promote the healthy development of foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
To date the goals of a proper economic growth and keeping
inflation under 10 percent have been achieved, and various
macro economic indexes have met the requirements set three years
ago, with some even better than expected.
</P>
<P>
Experts mentioned a number of indicators to demonstrate the
bright prospect for this year's economic trend:
</P>
<P>
During the January-September period, the growth rate in
commodity prices stood at 6.6 percent, while the economic growth
rate maintained at 10 percent or so;
</P>
<P>
Chinese peasants will reap a bumper harvest this year, with
total output of grain expected to reach 475 billion kilograms, a
rise of at least ten billion kg of grain over last year, according
to the Ministry of Agriculture;

<HEADLINE> Australian PM on Immigration Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard today warned the Liberal Party federal council that debate
on immigration should be sensitive and sensible.
</P>
<P>
At the council meeting held in Hobart, Howard indirectly
criticized the arguments advanced by Queensland independent MP
Pauline Hanson that immigration, particularly from Asia, could
lead to cultural clashes between rival ethnic groups, and the
country would face a Bosnia-style civil war.
</P>
<P>
Howard said that acceptance of people from the four corners of
the world, united behind a common set of Australian values,
remained a core value of the Liberal Party.
</P>
<P>
However, he mentioned, "In the last few weeks we have had a bit
of discussion about immigration, which I think is a good thing.
People should be able to express views on any subject without
being forced to endure a climate of intimidation."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the prime minister had been criticized for initially
failing to forcefully dismiss Hanson's remarks, excusing the
debate on free speech grounds, and has since spoken against her in
general terms.
</P>
<P>
Tonight, Hanson told Channel-Nine's 60-Minutes Program that she
was not a racist, she simply wanted "balance" restored to
immigration policies, which she claimed have allowed too many
Asians into Australia.

<HEADLINE> Sea Goddess Temple's 800th Anniversary Celebrated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, October 20 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 people from
Taiwan today took part in ceremonial rites to celebrate the 800th
anniversary of a temple dedicated to a sea goddess in Quanzhou
city, east China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
Sea goddess Mazu, worshiped in coastal areas in southeastern
China, was granted the title of Tianhou (celestial empress) by an
emperor from the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).
</P>
<P>
The Tianhou Temple in Quanzhou, initiated in 1196 in the Song
Dynasty (960-1279), is one of the oldest Mazu temples with the
oldest Mazu sculpture in existence. It is also the largest, and
only Mazu temple under state protection.
</P>
<P>
Mazu belief was taken to Taiwan during the Ming Dynasty
(1368-1644) when Zheng Chenggong, a famous general, recovered the
island.
</P>
<P>
Hsieh Cheng Yi, president of the Taiwan-based Chinese Affairs
Interchange Association (CAIA), says that more than half of Mazu
temples in Taiwan are the "children" of the Quanzhou Tianhou
Temple.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan, with three fourths of its population believing in Mazu,
has around 800 Mazu temples.
</P>
<P>
According to Hsieh, Mazu culture was based on traditional
Chinese culture.
</P>
<P>
A symposium on Mazu culture will also be held during the
week long celebrations.
</P>
<P>
A similar symposium, sponsored by CAIA, was held in Taiwan last
year.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the State Bureau of Cultural Relics, experts on
ancient buildings, and leaders of Quanzhou city took part in

<HEADLINE> Iranian Press Welcomes Chirac's Middle East Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Iranian newspapers today
expressed welcome to French President Jacques Chirac's Middle East
peace mission.
</P>
<P>
English daily Iran News recommended the Arab countries to
welcome Chirac as "an effective and impartial mediator," saying
that the United States has :lost its credibility as a peace
broker."
</P>
<P>
"All the developments in recent months proved beyond any doubt
that the occupant of the White House will continue to damage
U.S. prestige and interests in order to keep the Washington
Zionist lobby pleased," the paper said in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the peace process needed an honest middleman,
the editorial said that Europe, particularly France, should have
its role in finding a just solution to the chronic problems faced
by the Palestinians, Lebanese and the Syrians.
</P>
<P>
"All the Arab countries directly involved in the Middle East
conflict should not waste any more time and should send a firm
message to Washington clearing their lack of trust in its biased
and one-sided mediation and demand that the European Union,
particularly France, be present in all future peace
negotiations," the daily said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the same subject, Tehran Times stressed that the
present arrangement for peace in the Middle East will not work
unless the true representatives of Palestinians are included in
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Ever since the outbreak of Arab-Israeli conflict, Arabs have
unfortunately put all their eggs in the U.S. basket. Regrettably,
the U.S. has betrayed the Arabs. But having pinned all their hopes
on the U.S., Arabs have been helplessly bearing the brunt of this
miscalculation," the daily noted.
</P>
<P>
France's greater role in the region will force the U.S. to

Chirac's Middle East would strengthen France's position both in
the Middle East and in the world.

<HEADLINE> China's Economy Enters Smooth, Proper Growth Period (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The total turnover of retail consumer goods is expected to grow
at 20 percent in the second half of the year, while the virtual
sale volume is to fluctuate at a growth rate of 10 percent over
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
According to an official with the State Statistical Bureau,
this year's average income of Chinese people is expected to grow
by four-five percent over last year, while the consumption level
is expected to improve by eight percent.
</P>
<P>
Though the "soft-landing" of the national economy could be
basically achieved within the year, it does not mean that the
overall economic situation of the country is free of problems.
</P>
<P>
A conspicuous problem is that a satisfactory solution is
waiting to be found to settle the problem of unemployment
resulting from enterprises plagued by difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that the fact that China has strengthened
macro-control, but not at the expense of sacrificing the sustained
and rapid development of its economy, or bringing about obvious
increase in unemployment, demonstrates that the Chinese government
has remarkably improved its ability to handle well the national
economy.

<HEADLINE> Japan Estimated to Re-establish Coalition Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Liberal Democratic Party
(LDP) is expected to re-establish a coalition government with
other parties due to its estimated failure to win a clear majority
in the country's general election today.
</P>
<P>
Television exit polls here showed that the LDP, because of a
record low voter turnout, could fall about 10 seats short of the
251 it needed to rule alone and end three years of coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
But local press said there is a glimmer of hope that the LDP
might scrape home with a slim majority.
</P>
<P>
The turnout is estimated at 58 percent, falling nearly 10
percentage points over the last general elections in 1993.

<HEADLINE> China Successfully Launches Its 49th Satellite (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- China successfully launched a
scientific exploration and technological experimental satellite
this afternoon (Sunday).
</P>
<P>
It brought the total number of satellites launched to 49,
playing a significant role in the national economy, experts said
in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The country's successes indicate that China's space industry
has now joined the high-tech sector, they added.
</P>
<P>
The first satellite was sent into the space from China on April
24 in 1970. All of the country's 49 satellites were blasted into
space from three satellite launch centers, Jiuquan, Xichang and
Taiyuan, with the help of nine types of indigenously developed
carrier rockets.
</P>
<P>
Among the 49 satellites, nine have been scientific and
technological experimental satellites, 17 retrievable remote
sensing, eight communications, two meteorological, two balloon
satellites for the measurement of the density of the atmosphere,
and 11 foreign satellites.
</P>
<P>
The nine scientific and technological experimental satellites,
and 17 retrievable remote sensing ones, were all low-orbit
satellites, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
Space surveys and experiments on new techniques have been
conducted by the scientific and technological satellites,
providing large amounts of data on geomagnetic fields, cosmic
rays, the ionosphere, X-rays from the sun, and infrared radiation.
</P>
<P>
Among the 17 retrievable remote sensing satellites, today's is
still operating in its projected orbit. A total of 15 have been
recovered, and one failed to return to earth.
</P>
<P>
Experts added that the data brought back by the recovered
satellites has been in widely used in national land surveys,
geological and seismic surveys, mineral resources prospecting,
construction of water conservancy works, siting of railways,
environmental protection, surveying and mapping of land and sea
areas, which have produced remarkable social and economic benefits.

<P>
In addition, research on space life and experiments on
micro-gravity environments, have been successfully conducted by using
the satellites.
</P>
<P>
What has merited special attention is the great achievements
scored in experiments on space crop seed breeding, which has
provided a new and effective way for increasing agricultural
production.
</P>
<P>
Five of the eight communications satellites are positioned in a
static orbit, 36,000 kilometers above the equator. They have
improved telecommunications, TV and radio transmissions, as well
as the overall standards of China's information technology.
</P>
<P>
The two meteorological satellites have been put into orbits
synchronized with the sun. High-quality cloud atlas pictures
taken by the satellites help greatly with weather forecasting,
environment monitoring, and disaster control and alleviation.
</P>
<P>
The launch of the 11 foreign satellites indicates that China's
space industry has entered the world market, experts said, adding
that the "Long March" family of carrier rockets have become a
rising competitor in the international satellite launching market.
</P>
<P>
China's space industry has so far established cooperation and
exchange relations with more than 70 countries and regions across
the world.

<P>
LONDON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- A British shipbuilder will
unveil on Monday a revolutionary design for a radar-evading
"stealth" warship, according to a BBC television report.
</P>
<P>
The Southampton-based Vosper Thorneycroft shipbuilding
company is working with the British Ministry of Defense
scientists on the "invisible" warship that could be put into
active service early next century, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Shipbuilding experts say that a system of water nozzles
will enable the warship to be enveloped in a fine mist,
hindering infra-red detection.
</P>
<P>
The new ship uses technology similar to that of the U.S.
F-117 and B-2 bombers, the experts added.

<HEADLINE> Ranks of HK's Working-Class Poor Increase, Says Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The ranks of Hong Kong's
working-class poor have been increasing by up to 16 percent a year
since 1993, according to the results of a survey released here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Social Security Society estimated 390,000 people
were now unemployed or earning less than the median wage, which
represents a sharp 63 percent rise on the figure of 240,000 six
years ago.
</P>
<P>
The survey was based on government statistics on household
incomes and population for the past four years.
</P>
<P>
The Society said fewer than 10 percent of unemployed people
were professionals.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, 180,000 people were earning less than half the medium
monthly salary of 7,000 HK dollars and about 60,000 were
unemployed. But by June this year, there were nearly 300,000
low-income earners and more than 90,000 unemployed, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Society said that the survey indicates that employment is
not a way to take people out of poverty. There seems to be a
structural problem in Hong Kong's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Policies must be drafted so employment could keep pace with
economic changes, it said.

LAGOS, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has seen a setback in
its efforts to yield higher earnings from non-oil exports this
year, the "Guardian" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry,
Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA) estimated that in the first half
of this year, the country's non-oil sectors exported 42 million
U.S. Dollars worth of goods, which is an equivalent of only 15
percent of the 287.7 million Dollars recorded from the sector in
1995.
</P>
<P>
The decline of exports by six major non-oil sectors has
continued into the third quarter, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
For example, cotton export dropped from 2.1 million Dollars in
July to 811,600 Dollars in August, and slid further to 380,000
Dollars in September. Earnings from rubber plummeted from 2.3
million Dollars in May to 266,000 Dollars in August.

<HEADLINE> Irish FM: Europe to Work With US for Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Irish Foreign Minister Dick
Spring has said that Europe would work with, not against,
Washington to push forward the Arab-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"There is no competition between Europeans and Americans. We
want to work together, we both have roles to play in this very
respect," Spring told reporters after he visited Egypt earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
Spring, sent by the European Union (EU) to meet Israeli and
Palestinian officials, confirmed the anxiety of the 15-nation bloc
over the stalled peace talks and its offer to help with the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Ireland currently holds the rotating EU presidency.
</P>
<P>
"Europe is very worried at not having a force in the region to
push the peace process. We are watching the situation closely," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Irish official also said Europe was willing to offer
financial and political help to support Palestinian-Israeli peace
accords and that it would appoint a special envoy to the region.
</P>
<P>
Spring will set off for Israel for a potentially controversial
trip to Israel and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
He has said that he may meet Palestinian officials in Orient
House, their office in the disputed Arab east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel has strongly condemned the venue and threatened to
boycott his visit if he would go to the Orient House, a move seen
by Israel as backing for Palestinian claims to east Jerusalem
which the Jewish state captured in 1967 Middle East war.

<P>
JIUQUAN, October 20 (Xinhua) -- China successfully launched a
satellite for scientific exploration and technological experiment
at the Jiuquan Satellite Launching Centre in northwest China this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The satellite, launched at 15:20 hours Beijing time by a Long
March-2D carrier rocket, smoothly entered the preset orbit with all
instruments aboard operating well.
</P>
<P>
This is the 17th retrievable, remote-sensing satellite China
has so far launched.
</P>
<P>
The satellite, scheduled to operate 15 days in the orbit,
and equipped with scientific experimental devices and materials,
will conduct scientific and technological experiments in the
space, in addition to obtaining remote-sensing data.
</P>
<P>
This is the 43rd launch of the Long March serial carrier
rockets. The Long March-2D rocket used in today's launch is a
two-stage, liquid-fuelled carrier that stands 38.3 metres long
with a takeoff weight of 232 tons. Put first into use in 1992, the
carrier rocket has successfully conducted three launchings.
</P>
<P>
China has successfully conducted many scientific
explorations and over 200 piggyback experiments with retrievable,

<HEADLINE> No Consensus Yet on New APEC Members, Says Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) have not reached a
consensus on accepting new members and the criteria for membership
will be discussed further, an APEC official said here this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference before the end of an APEC senior
officials meeting here, Philippine Foreign Under-Secretary
Federico Macaranas said that the officials have discussed the
membership issue but have not reached a consensus on it yet.
</P>
<P>
APEC imposed a moratorium on accepting new members years ago to
allow its members to concentrate on deepening their commitment to
the objective of the organization to transform Asia-Pacific into a
dynamic region through a free market economy.
</P>
<P>
Macaranas, chairman of the senior officials meeting, said that
the criteria for membership "will be further refined for the next
few weeks and hopefully it could be presented to the ministers for
approval in November," he said.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said that the current discussion on membership
criteria takes into account the geographic criteria, the measure
of economic linkage or involvement with APEC economies and the
degree of interest in APEC.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day meeting, the officials also discussed the
draft of "the Manila Action Plan for APEC." The action plan is
described as the road map for the implementation of the APEC
vision of a dynamic Asia- Pacific, where free and open trade and
investment will reign by the year 2010 for developed economies and
2020 for developing economies.
</P>
<P>
APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Chinese Taipei,
Thailand, and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Stockpiles Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Australian wool stockpiles
would fall below two million bales within the next few weeks, Wool
International (WI) said today.
</P>
<P>
WI, the body responsible for the stockpile's disposal, also
said the industry's wool debt had fallen below one billion
Australian dollars (0.8 billion US dollars) from 2.8 billion
Australian dollars in 1991.
</P>
<P>
"So far 137,000 bales have been sold from the stockpile for the
last quarter of 1996," WI Director Charles Armstrong was quoted by
a media release as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to him, much wool had been sold at above current
auction prices and there had already been forward sales for the
first quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
This followed a WI decision to reduce the stockpile disposal
from 187,000 bales a quarter to 135,000 by January 1 and 90,000 by
July next year.

<HEADLINE> Indian Central Bank Moves to Check Economic Slowdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) Saturday announced some changes in its credit policy in a
bid to check economic slowdown, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The changes include a two percent reduction in the cash reserve
ratio (CRR), reduction in prime lending rates, and removal of
selective credit controls.
</P>
<P>
By making these announcements, the central bank has sent firm
signals to commercial banks in the country to reduce interest
rates and directed increased lending to the productive sectors of
the economy to maintain and sustain the growth.
</P>
<P>
The new RBI monetary policy package was designed to spurt the
Indian economy which has shown continuous slowdown in growth in
the recent months.
</P>
<P>
Economists, who warn of a possible recession ahead if proper
measures were not to be taken, believe that high credit cost is
one of the main factors leading to the economic slowdown.

<HEADLINE> Irish FM: Europe to Work With US for Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Irish Foreign Minister Dick
Spring has said that Europe would work with, not against,
Washington to push forward the Arab-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"There is no competition between Europeans and Americans. We
want to work together, we both have roles to play in this very
respect," Spring told reporters after meeting Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak here Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Spring, sent by the European Union (EU) to meet Israeli and
Palestinian officials, confirmed the anxiety of the 15-nation bloc
over the stalled peace talks and its offer to help with the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Ireland currently holds the rotating EU presidency.
</P>
<P>
"Europe is very worried at not having a force in the region to
push the peace process. We are watching the situation closely," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Irish official also said Europe was willing to offer
financial and political help to support Palestinian-Israeli peace
accords and that it would appoint a special envoy to the region.
</P>
<P>
Spring will set off for Israel for a potentially controversial
trip to Israel and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
He has said that he may meet Palestinian officials in Orient
House, their office in the disputed Arab east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israel has strongly condemned the venue and threatened to
boycott his visit if he would go to the Orient House, a move seen
by Israel as backing for Palestinian claims to east Jerusalem
which the Jewish state captured in 1967 Middle East war.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Demands for Higher Salary Rise in Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian government has
averted a planned strike by medical professionals throughout the
kingdom through reaching an agreement Saturday regarding
additional allowances on their salaries, but other professionals
are also demanding wage rises.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came in the form of a memorandum of
understanding signed by Health Minister Aref Bataineh and the
Jordanian Medical Association (JMA) board, today's English daily
Jordan Times reported.
</P>
<P>
Members of the JMA, including physicians, nurses, midwives,
pharmacists and veterinarians employed by the public sector,
projected sit-in and subsequent open strikes for higher salaries
and better working conditions.
</P>
<P>
A statement following the meeting between the two sides said
the memorandum provides for raising the overtime allowance
granted to physicians and dentists from 30 to 60 percent on the
basic salary as a first measure to be followed by other steps.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum also called for increases in overtime allowance
for nurses, midwives, pharmacists and veterinarians.
</P>
<P>
It also provides for amendments to the unified allowance
system and that of the Civil Service Commission as soon as
possible to include the agreed on allowance.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting, the minister said the government
appreciated the efforts of the medical staff in public hospitals
and health centers and understood their requests and demands.
</P>
<P>
The medical professionals went on strike earlier this year to
demand higher salary and better working conditions, but the
government did not respond positively.
</P>
<P>
It is the second time the government approved salary increases
for professionals in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
The government signed Friday an eight-point agreement calling
for a rise in the public sector engineers' basic salary.
</P>
<P>
The agreement did not specify the amount of the increase in
the engineers' basic salary, but stipulates that engineers will
advance to higher levels of the public sector employees' scale
and that all engineers working on a daily basis will be granted a
contract.
</P>
<P>
It also called for the establishment of a committee which is
supposed to submit amendments to the current by-laws regulating
the engineers' wage within the next three months.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, the Jordan Press Association (JPA) demanded a
50 percent allowance increase for its members employed at the
state's official news agency Jordan News Agency, Petra.
</P>
<P>
JPA President Seif Al Sharif disclosed that the association
submitted a memorandum last week to Prime Minister Abdul Karim
Kabariti, demanding that the allowance be raised from the
present 60 percent to 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the press association has not got a positive reply
from the government.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believed that once the government approved the
demands of some professionals to increase their salary, other
professionals will follow suit because the prices soared year on
year since the 1990-1991 Gulf crisis while the salary for
employees at the public sector remained at the pre-Gulf crisis
level.
</P>
<P>
They predicted a forthcoming overall increase in salary for
various professions, adding that the overboard increase will
hinder the government's efforts to implement the international
Monetary Fund-sponsored economic reform which aimed to reduce the
country's budget deficit and increase the independence of the
kingdom.

<HEADLINE> Money to Be Sole Factor in North Thailand's Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 20 (Xinhua) -- A Chiang Mai University
academic believes that money is the sole crucial factor in
deciding which politicians in the north get elected to the house
of representatives where a total of 75 seats are at stake.
</P>
<P>
Chakrapand Wongburanavart, dean of the Chiang Mai University's
Social Science Faculty, said, "money will certainly become the
decisive factor in the general election in the north," according
to a Bangkok Post report today.
</P>
<P>
He said that because election regulations had not been changed,
"vote-buying would be rampant and uncontrollable" in the November
17 general election for the 393-seat new house.
</P>
<P>
"It will be much worse than during the last election (in
1995)," he added.
</P>
<P>
He urged care-taker Prime Minister and concurrently Interior
Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa to set up a committee to fight
vote-buying during the elections.
</P>
<P>
Some constituencies in the north, northeast and Bangkok, where
contest will be keen and vote-buying will be a problem, are on the
top watch list of the pollwatch committee and the police
department.

</P>
<P>
The Sunday times:
</P>
<P>
-- Labor's lead over the Tories has fallen to its lowest level
for nearly three years, according to the latest NOP poll for the

circumstances" and believes that faith "adds life, reason and
content to a set of rules."
</P>
<P>
The Observer:
</P>
<P>
-- Britain has agreed a secret plan to re-equip the Argentine
navy in return for a lucrative deal to explore for oil in the
disputed waters around the Falklands. Ministers do not intend to
reveal the intended relaxation of its weapons embargo against
Argentina, despite the controversy sparked by a similar move in
the "arms to Iraq" affair.
</P>
<P>
Independent On Sunday:
</P>
<P>
-- Britain's European partners are making detailed plans for
the future shape of the European Union, which take little or no
account of the concerns of British Conservatives, the Independent
on Sunday has learned.

<HEADLINE> Jailed Bangladeshi Ex-President Assured of Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The English daily quoted a reliable source of the Jatiya party,
in which Ershad has been the chairman, as saying that the party
leaders held talks with the higher political authority of the
government on how to secure the early release of their jailed
leader.
</P>
<P>
Several rounds of meetings are reported to have been held by
Ershad's lawyers and the attorney-general along with his deputies
in the regard, the daily disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The lawyers found that it might take at least 6 months to deal
with all the 18 corruption cases against Ershad in different
courts for clearing him and in no way his release from the jail
could be assured ahead of that as for each of the cases his bail
petition would have to be moved separately, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Ershad took power as president in 1982 and has been serving
prison terms since 1990 after his military regime was forced to
stepped down by mass movement.
</P>
<P>
after the present ruling Awami league (al) won simple majority
seats in the 7th parliamentary elections on June 12, Ershad
immediately expressed JP's support for AL's formation of new
government and allowed JP Secretary General Anwar Hossain to join
the consensus government led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina later
on.
</P>
<P>
Since July 14, Ershad was brought out of the Dhaka central jail
to attend the parliament session. Since then, he is allowed
telephone facility inside his sub-jail in the parliament premises.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that Ershad was also granted bail Saturday in yet
another corruption case, bringing the number of bails he received
so far to 5.

<HEADLINE> Drug Scandal Shakes Hong Kong Sports Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The clean image of Hong
Kong's sports has been shattered following a drug scandal
involving three local athletes, a local English-language newspaper
reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The three, all body-builders, tested positive for banned
performance-enhancing substance during last month's Hong Kong
Open, it was revealed on Saturday. It was the first time tests
were carried out in such championships.
</P>
<P>
The IOC-recognized laboratory in Beijing, where urine samples
of the athletes were sent for test, confirmed the positive
results.
</P>
<P>
A Hong Kong Body Building Association official also confirmed
the positive results but declined to identify the athletes.
</P>
<P>
Chau Po-ping, honorary secretary of the HKBDA, said that an
official announcement would be made after an executive meeting on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The association would also send a report to the Asian
Body-building Federation, Hong Kong's Amateur Sports Federation
and the Olympic Committee and the Hong Kong Sports Development
Board (SDB) on the findings.
</P>
<P>
The athletes are expected to be suspended for one year, with
their titles to be stripped and prize money returned, but the
association might be lenient to the first-time offenders, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
"I suppose they had taken the drugs by mistake because they did
not have the proper education about the harmful effects of taking
performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that a two-year suspension would be handed down
on any offenders in the future, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ip Hay-wood, Director of Sports Development of the SDB, said
the body would not take any actions against the athletes as HKBBA
did not receive any funding from the SDB.
</P>
<P>
But she warned of a suspension of financial support to any
athletes failing doping tests, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The SDB official urged the Hong Kong authorities to speed up
their procedure to establish an independent statutory body to
fight against doping in sports.

<HEADLINE> Hundreds of Baby Green Turtles Return to South China Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- As many as 1,200 baby green
turtles were recently sent back to the sea from a nature reserve
in Huidong, a port city in south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
They were the first turtles to hatch this year. Another
thousand eggs are in the process of hatching.
</P>
<P>
The reserve had trouble with some poachers in 1992, leading to
a sharp decrease in the number of turtles going ashore to lay eggs.
</P>
<P>
Various kinds of protective measures were taken by the staff to
restore the ecological balance, and the number of turtles
returning to the zone has had a steady increase. By September, 75
turtles went ashore, laying 4,642 eggs.

<HEADLINE> Round-Up: Japanese Start Voting Under New System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese voters started going
to the polls today to elect 500 members of the House of
Representatives in the first of a new electoral system that could
mark the beginning of a realignment in Japanese politics.
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, 300 single-seat candidates will be
elected while 200 seats will be decided by proportional
representations.
</P>
<P>
The new system is widely expected to move Japan in the
direction of a Western-style political scheme dominated by two
parties. But analysts agree the evolution of the new framework
will take some time.
</P>
<P>
According to the election officials, a record 1,503 candidates
from nine parties are contesting.
</P>
<P>
The major focus immediately after the poll will be the make-up
of the new administration, including whether the pre-election
ruling coalition of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP), the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and New
Party Sakigake will continue even if all the parties get enough
seats.
</P>
<P>
With many opinion polls suggesting that the LDP, the dominant
force in the three-way coalition, may recover a simple majority in
the powerful lower house, and it is widely believed that
Hashimoto, 59, will remain at the helm of government after the
election.
</P>
<P>
The polls predicted that the LDP would win a simple majority in
the lower house, but the party's lack of a majority in the upper
house means the next government could still have to be cobbled
from a coalition.
</P>
<P>
The LDP had 211 seats in the lower chamber when Hashimoto
dissolved the house on September 27 for a snap election.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the LDP only controls 108 out of the 252 seats in
the upper house and needs to win the cooperation of an additional
19 upper house members to gain a bare majority in the chamber.
</P>
<P>
To ensure a stable government, many LDP leaders cited the need
to link up with other political forces, including the party's
current coalition partners -- the SDP and Sakigake, which had been
cooperating with the LDP in the cabinet since 1994.
</P>
<P>
The LDP may also try to woo into its fold the newly formed
Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), which is expected to maintain its
predissolution strength of 52 seats.
</P>
<P>
The leading opposition New Frontier Party (NFP), led by Ichiro
Ozawa, is unlikely to wrest power, with surveys indicating it
could be difficult for the party to maintain its pre-election
strength of 160 seats.
</P>
<P>
The NFP will be forced to try to keep its discipline over its
members who may bolt for the LDP after the election because of
dissatisfaction with being the party of opposition.
</P>
<P>
However, some analysts said that the party, which was a product
of a merger of nine opposition forces in December 1994, may even
run the risk of collapsing should it fail to grab the reins of the
government.
</P>
<P>
A total of 98 million Japanese are eligible to cast ballots in
the 41st general election, up 3.2 percent from the last poll, with
the number of voters up in all 47 prefectures.
</P>
<P>
The races in single-seat constituencies drew 1,503 aspirants,
including a record 153 women. A total of 566 people are running
both in single-seat and proportional representation voting
districts.
</P>
<P>
The polls opened at 7 a.m. (22:00 GMT Saturday) and the vote
counting begins in all prefectures before 8 p.m. (11:00 GMT).
</P>
<P>
If the counting procedure goes without any major problem,
initial results are expected around midnight, and the final
results will likely be declared early Monday, election officials
said.

BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of
Communications has urged ship examining departments to strictly
examine small-sized ships before issuing operation licenses.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua has been told that the growing number of small ships is
overwhelming inland river systems, especially in areas with many
rivers.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu province in east China has around 250,000 small ships
and boats, while Zhejiang province 200,000.
</P>
<P>
Because of out-of-date equipment and poor management, hundreds
of thousands of such ships and boats discharge large quantities of
greasy waste water, domestic waste and raw sewage, as well as
poisonous and harmful materials.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that each boat produces 10 kilograms of greasy
waste water every day.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Communications also called on concerned
departments to set up facilities to dispose of waste discharged by
these ships and boats.

<P>
BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Government will
strengthen its support of small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs)
and their reform, said Chen Qingtai, vice-minister of the State
Economic and Trade Commission (SETC), according to today's China
daily.
</P>
<P>
"The reform of SMEs in China aims at freeing their creativity
and energy, shifting their operational systems and moving towards
the market to give full play to their vitality," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen spoke at the '96 Changzhou Convention on International
Economic Co-operation and Trade between Small and Medium-size
enterprises recently.
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by fierce competition in the international market,
SMEs are in an unfavourable position in terms of financing, market
access, information, technology and staff qualification, forcing
them to ask support and aid from the government, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chen pointed out that the central government has paid great
attention to the development of SMEs and taken measures to promote
the support and service for and reform of the SMEs.
</P>
<P>
Efforts have been made in creating a sound environment for the
development of the SMEs, he said, adding that many regulations in
this regard have been drafted and are being revised to speed up
the construction of labour market, perfect social insurance system
and promote the transfer of government functions.

<HEADLINE> Millions of Cotton Spindles Eliminated in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The China National Textile
Council plans to institute a permit system in the production and
purchase of cotton-spinning frames to rein in excess production
capacity, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Xu Kunyuan, vice-chairman of the council, said the move is
necessary to improve efficiency.
</P>
<P>
China's cotton-spinning sector has been plagued by excess
production capacity, outdated facilities and rising cotton prices
in recent years. As a result, the whole sector has reported
losses.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1991, the sector has a total of 41.91 million
cotton spindles, among which about 10 million are outdated.
</P>
<P>
The council, after carefully studying the current and future
market demand for cotton yarn and fabric, decided in 1992 to
eliminate 10 million cotton spindles by 1998.
</P>
<P>
The State Council has also implemented preferential policies to
support the reduction of five million cotton spindles, and it has
required local government to take account of their own situation
and eliminate anther five cotton spindles.
</P>
<P>
Xu said the State and local government have together cut 2.79
million cotton spindles, including 1.4 million cut by the State
and 1.39 million cut by local government.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Nelson Ndereva of Kenya beat
China's Hu Gangjun with four kilometers to go and maintained his
lead unchallenged to win the 16th Beijng marathon in two hours, 10
minutes and 37 seconds here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ndereva, who ran his fifth marathon with a personal best
2:12:15, reeled over Hu at the 37.5-kilometer mark and kept his
big kick to the finish.
</P>
<P>
Hu, winner of the race in 1993 and 1994, clocked 2:11.10 to
finish second ahead of China's Dong Jiangmin, 2:11:41.
</P>
<P>
Jan Huruk of Poland, who ranked third at the Tokyo marathon
last year and led all the way before the first 37 kilometers,
wound up fourth in 2:11:58.
</P>
<P>
Abebe Mekonnen of Ethiopia, the hot favourite before the race,
finished a disappointed seventh in 2:13:21.
</P>
<P>
In the women's 42.192-kilometer race, China's Ren Xiujuan,
winner of the 1996 World Cup half marathon and defending champion,
underlined her superiority by beating the race record with a
winning time of 2:27:13.
</P>
<P>
Another Chinese Zheng Guixia, runner-up last year, wound up
second in 2:29:40, in front of her teammate Pan Jinhong, 2:29:38.
</P>
<P>
A field of more than 300 runners including 33 internationals
took part in today's race, the largest ever in the race's history.
</P>
<P>
Huruk, 36, took the pace and hit the half-mark point in
1:04:48, leading two minute and 32 seconds over the chasing field
paced by Zbigniew Nadolski of Poland and Dong Jiangmin of
China. Hu and Abebe followed at their heels closely. At that time,
Nelson was out of the top ten.
</P>
<P>
But Nelson and Hu caught up with Huruk at the 37.5-kilometer,
and a few minutes later, Nelson opened a clear gap to head for the
 victory.
</P>
<P>
"I am satisfied with the result. I believed I could have run
better if the weather was not too humid," the 23-year-old winner
said after the triumph.
</P>
<P>
"I had a difficult time between 25 to 30 kilometers, but after
that period, I knew I could win," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hu, runner-up last year, told Xinhua that Nelson was too strong
for him to follow during the final stage. "My time was not good
enough, but I had tried my best," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
In the women's section, Ren, whose best time was 2:30:00 before
the race, clocked 1:14:34 together with Zheng at the turn-over,
but Ren increased her speed and led almost two minutes over Zheng
at the 40km mark. The battled was settled for the first place
after that.
</P>
<P>
"I planed to run about 2:28:00. I am glad to beat that mark. I
saved some stronge for the Lalian marathon. It will be held in
Lalian seven days later," Ren said.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,100 local runners took part in the men's and
women's 10-kilometer events. Yang Yong won the male race in 31:53
while Wang Xiujie placed first in the female pool in 35:16.

<HEADLINE> HK, Singapore sign Bilateral Repurchase Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Monetary Authority of
Singapore (MAS) and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)
jointly announced on Saturday that a bilateral repurchase (repo)
agreement between the two institutions has been signed in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
The agreement with the MAS is HKMA's seventh such agreement.
The HKMA has earlier signed repo agreements with central banks
from Australia, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and
Thailand. The MAS has earlier entered such agreements with
central banks from the region.
</P>
<P>
A bilateral repo agreement is the simultaneous agreement to buy
securities for an agreed amount of cash and to sell back the same
securities at a specific later date for a specified amount.
Highly liquid U.S. dollar Government securities are the
instruments used in all the repo agreements signed between the
HKMA and regional central banks.
</P>
<P>
Entering these well secured agreements with central banks,
whose credit standing are generally higher than those of private
sector banks, would improve liquidity of the central banks under
minimal risk.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Start Voting Under New System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese voters started going
to the polls today to elect 500 members of the House of
Representatives in the first of a new electoral system that could
mark the beginning of a realignment in Japanese politics.
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, voters elect 300 single-seat candidates
while 200 seats are decided by proportional representations.
</P>
<P>
The new system is widely expected to move Japan in the
direction of a Western-style political scheme dominated by two
parties. But analysts agree the evolution of the new framework
will take some time. A record 1,503 candidates from nine parties
are contesting the poll.
</P>
<P>
The major focus immediately after the poll will be the make-up
of the new administration, including whether the pre-election
ruling coalition of Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP), the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and New
Party Sakigake will be continued even if all the parties get
enough seats.
</P>
<P>
With many opinion polls suggesting that the LDP, the dominate
force in the three-way coalition, may recover a simple majority in
the powerful Lower House, it is widely believed that Hashimoto,
59, will remain at the helm of government after the election.
</P>
<P>
The LDP had 211 seats in the Lower Chamber when Hashimoto
dissolved the house on September 27 for a snap election. The
party has maintained a coalition with the SDP and Sakigake since
June 1994.
</P>
<P>
The leading opposition New Frontier Party (NFP), led by Ichiro
Ozawa, is unlikely to wrest power, with surveys indicating it
could be difficult for the party to maintain its pre-election
strength of 160 seats.
</P>
<P>
A total of 98 million Japanese are eligible to cast ballots in
the 41st general election, up 3.2 percent from the last poll, with
the number of voters up in all 47 prefectures.
</P>
<P>
The races in single-seat constituencies drew 1,503 aspirants,
including a record 153 women. A total of 566 people are running
both in single-seat and proportional representation voting
districts.
</P>
<P>
The polls opened at 7 a.m. (22:00 GMT Saturday) and the vote
counting begins in all prefectures before 8 p.m. (11:00 GMT).
</P>
<P>
If the counting procedure goes without any major problem,
initial results are expected around midnight.
</P>
<P>
Final results will likely be declared early Monday, according
to election officials.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The first phase of the
construction of a major health institute in east Nepal's Sunsari
district has completed with assistance of the Indian government,
Nepali health officials said today.
</P>
<P>
The B. P. Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, named after the
late renowned Nepali democratic leader, was established under an
agreement between Nepal and India in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Under a bilateral agreement signed later for the implementation
of the project, the Indian government has taken the responsibility
of the repair and renovation of old buildings at the project site
as the first phase.
</P>
<P>
Other facilities including medical college and hospital
buildings in the health complex would be constructed as the second
phase of the project, which located about 200 km east of
Kathmandu.
</P>
<P>
The project, with a total estimated cost of 22.5 million US
dollars for the first and second phases, would directly provide
employment to about 1,700 people after its completion in October
1998.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, the Nepali government is to
contribute some 14 million dollars to the project including
construction of campus walls, water supplies, communications and
roads.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Largest Port Faces Manifold Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- the Chittagong port, the largest
port of Bangladesh, is now riddled with manifold problems
affecting the national maritime trade, according to port
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The problems included the lack of quay gantry cranes, long
dwelling time of import containers, low stacking height of
containers at the storage yard, low utilization of computer
system, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Due to absence of quay gantry cranes, loading and discharging
of containers to and from container vessels have relied on ship's
gear which resulted in low productivity of container handling.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the average dwell time of imported containers stored
at the storage facilities in Chittagong port, which exceeds 25
days, is longer compared with that of the main ports in the world.
</P>
<P>
This situation not only prevents efficient utilization of the
port facilities, but also forces the excessive investment for
preparation of additional storage space and facilities.
</P>
<P>
The Chittagong port authority attributed the reasons for the
enormous problems to rapid growth of container traffic in the
port. Container handling in Chittagong port has grown at an
average rate of 18 percent during the last five years.
</P>
<P>
As the high growth rate of container traffic is expected to
continue for a few more years, the port authority claimed that all
those problems should be seriously taken up and eliminated with
urgent necessity.

<HEADLINE> Banks Urged to Boost Direct Trade Among OIC States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Two simultaneous international
meetings of Muslim businessmen called on financial institutions
and banks in member countries of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference (OIC) to help boost direct trade among OIC members.
</P>
<P>
The call was made Saturday in the final declaration of the 14th
Islamic Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ICCI) meeting and the
3rd World Muslim Businessmen's meeting held in Bandung, capital of
west Java province of Indonesia, reports reaching here today said.
</P>
<P>
To boost direct trade among OIC members, the participants said
financial bodies in OIC states should expand their export credit
facilities and grant special tariff reduction on exports from one
OIC country to another.
</P>
<P>
The declaration stressed the importance of export credit
insurance and better investment protection to spur trade among OIC
member countries.
</P>
<P>
It called on member countries to promote bilateral trade in
cooperation with the Islamic Development Bank (IDB).
</P>
<P>
The declaration, which contains 17 points, reminded member
countries of the need to draw up new guidelines on export and
import among them.

<HEADLINE> Taklimakan Desert Possible to Witness Growing More Oases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, October 20 (Xinhua) -- New life has been breathed into
a Chinese desert known as the "Sea of Death" because of its
hostile environment.
</P>
<P>
Research by Chinese scientists has led to the creation of
man-made oases in the Taklimakan Desert, the world's second
largest desert.
</P>
<P>
Pilot projects could pave the way for a living green future in
the sandy barreness of the Taklimakan, following the research
achievements by the Chinese scientists.
</P>
<P>
They have developed 300,000 sand-fixed tree seedlings in the
desert, and 29 kinds of vegetables have been successfully grown
there, with 2.6 hectares of green land cultivated in the
Taklimakan.
</P>
<P>
The desert sits in Tarim Basin in northwest China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region, with an area of 330,000 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists from Tarim Oil Exploration and Development
Company, attached to China National Petroleum Corporation, Lanzhou
Institute of Desert and Xinjiang Institute of Biology and Pedology
started trial planting of more than 160 kinds of plants in
Taklimakan two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Some 100 kinds of plants survived in the desert, and the
scientists have chosen 17 kinds of plants with effective
sand-fixing characteristics for future afforestation.
</P>
<P>
During the tree planting, the research team adopted mechanical,
chemical and biological methods to fix the plants into the sand.
</P>
<P>
They also successfully took local salt water for the growing
trees and vegetables, using special irrigation techniques.
</P>
<P>
A group of 12 experts from the Chinese Academy of Engineering,
Chinese Academy of Sciences, and other institutes working in
desert research, said after their appraisal of desert
afforestation that planting of trees and vegetables in the
hinterland areas of large deserts was a pioneering undertaking in
China.
</P>
<P>
They said salt water irrigation was also a new technological
development, helping in a pioneering drive for the greening of the
deserts.

<HEADLINE> China Schedules Bond Issue for Three Gorges Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, October 20 (Xinhua) -- China will issue one billion yuan
(about 120 million US dollars) in three and five-year bonds next
month for the development of the gigantic Three Gorges Project on
the middle reaches of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Guolin, deputy general manager of Yangtze (Changjiang)
Three Gorges Development Corp., said that his company plans to
issue even more bonds, and possibly shares, next year.
</P>
<P>
Yuan told a visiting delegation of members of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference from Hong Kong that
construction of the world's largest water control project will
need more investment from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"We will further tap the role of Hong Kong as an international
financial center in our fund-raising activities and hope Hong Kong
investors will make investment in the project," he said.
</P>
<P>
A number of Hong Kong companies has already invested in the dam
and nearby areas, according to Yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Project, which is expected to cost 90 billion
yuan in fixed current prices, will take nearly 20 years to
complete.
</P>
<P>
"Construction of the Three Gorges Project has been going
smoothly since 1993," Yuan said, adding that investment in the
project had come to 17 billion yuan as of August.
</P>
<P>
Financing for the project includes a special construction fund,
which is based on the collection of electricity fees
nationwide. Others include revenues from power generation of the
Gezhouba Power Plant, domestic and foreign loans, and bond and
share issues.
</P>
<P>
Domestic loans, valued at nearly three billion yuan each year,
are mainly granted by the State Development Bank, a policy bank
established in 1994 to finance large infrastructural
projects.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica to Defuse 5,000 Land Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican police will start
next week an operation to defuse approximately 5,000 land mines
laid in its border zone with Nicaragua, according to sources close
to the police authorities.
</P>
<P>
A specialized team of 30 field workers and six officers of the
Organization of American States (OAS) and the Brazilian and
Colombian armies will also participate in the defusing of these
mines that were planted during the Nicaraguan internecine war.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that although the problem has not caused
victims in Costa Rican territory so far, but the fields where the
mines are planted are very productive and they are not cultivated
because their owners are afraid to work in them.
</P>
<P>
The period to fulfill the task has been estimated at two years,
and to execute it the Costa Rican policemen have received training
in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investors Encouraged to Help Restructure State Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Jilin
Province recently issued preferential policies encouraging
overseas investors to join its efforts in restructuring local
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Foreign businesses participating in the efforts will be granted
comprehensive support from local governments and banking
institutions.
</P>
<P>
State-owned companies in Jilin, one of the oldest industrial
bases in China, are presently facing a variety of difficulties
caused by the lack of funds, technology and quality products
needed for the country's ongoing market reform.
</P>
<P>
The province is now inviting foreign investment in the sectors
of agriculture, automotives, petrochemicals, construction, new
materials, bio-engineering and public utilities.
</P>
<P>
The new policies allow foreigners to hold the staking control
of local state-owned firms, and to contract, lease and purchase
them. However, in some industries foreign stake control will not
be permitted in line with related State policies.
</P>
<P>
The local governments will offer assistance to the overseas
investors with loans, funds and production means as well as
land-use and taxation, while local banks will give priority to
their financial needs.
</P>
<P>
The province has established a special category for
administration and service for overseas investors, and the
provincial government has promised to improve local laws, policies
and regulations to standardize economic activities and protect the
interests of foreign investors.

<HEADLINE> Fujian Sees Steady Growth in Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Southeast China's Fujian
Province has been experiencing steady growth in its economy since
the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, in the first nine months, the
province's economic growth rate was recorded at 15 percent,
maintaining the same level of last year.
</P>
<P>
Local officials explained that entering the third quarter of
the year, governments at various levels have worked to solve or
improve various factors which had hampered a healthy economic
development, laying a sound foundation for a new round of economic
growth in the Ninth Five-Year-Plan Period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
While experiencing sustained growth in industrial production,
the province has kept a balance between production and marketing,
and the situation of state-owned enterprises losing money has been
brought under control.
</P>
<P>
Provincial departments have also drafted new measures to suit
the adjustment of policies governing China's foreign trade and
economic cooperation. In the July-September period, the province
has seen increases month by month in its foreign trade, despite a
fall in foreign trade in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
It has seen steady increases in fixed assets, and major
construction projects have been proceeding smoothly, according to
local officials.

<HEADLINE> Wildlife Industry to Meet Increasing Appetite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- A conference was held recently
in southwest China's Yunnan Province to discuss how to reconcile
protection of wildlife with people's increasing appetite for rare
animals and plants.
</P>
<P>
The province has temperate and tropical climates, and many
different flora and fauna. The convoluted terrain and diverse
climate have created an abundance of species, but they are often
small in number, scientists say.
</P>
<P>
Both officials and researchers at the conference say they are
in favor of developing a wildlife industry. There were more than
100 representatives of provincial forestry department,
enterprises, and research institutes at the conference.
</P>
<P>
The wildlife industry has in fact already taken off in the
province, with more than a dozen farms raising different species
of animals. Ostriches, deer, peacocks, and pheasants are now
raised in captivity at the Yunnan Science and Technology Park,
producing 520 million yuan worth last year.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the conference also suggested that the
government set up a committee on animal and plant development for
special purposes, and that schools offer related courses.

<HEADLINE> Wuhan Claims Success in Controlling Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Air pollution has eased in Wuhan,
a major port city on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River,
despite big rises in population and industrial growth over the
past decade.
</P>
<P>
Dust in the air has been reduced by 33 percent over the ten
years, and pollutants are also decreasing. This has been achieved
while the population has increased by one million. Industrial
output and coal use have also both doubled during the past ten
years, according to Liu Muting, a senior engineer at the Wuhan
Environmental Protection Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that the feat was obtained after the government had
invested more than 300 million yuan to renovate boilers and
introduce new technology to control pollution.
</P>
<P>
The engineer said that the city is now focusing on reducing
pollution caused by car fumes, which has replaced smoke from coal
manufacturing as the major source of pollution over the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
He said that the city has imported technology from New Zealand
and required some of the city's cars to burn clean fuel and
liquidated gas as fuel, instead of petroleum. The benefit is that
the harmful substances in their exhaust fumes can be reduced by 92
percent.
</P>
<P>
The city is now promoting the use of such cars, he said.
